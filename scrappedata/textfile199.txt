Advertencias : Universo Alternativo, porque Thomas también sobrevivió. Tanto él como Edith tienen una segunda oportunidad y aquí os dejo un vistazo de lo que podría haber pasado meses y, más adelante, años después. Es la primera historia que escribo dentro de este fandom, así que toda opinión es bienvenida. Nada de insultos o comentarios obscenos. están juntos [thomas & edith] El espejo le devolvió su reflejo distorsionado. Thomas paseó la yema de los dedos por encima de la piel cicatrizada de su pómulo izquierdo. Ni siquiera tenía el valor de tocar la herida directamente. Ya no dolía, al menos no físicamente. A veces se despertaba sobresaltado pensando que la piel se le había vuelto a abrir, que iba a morir desangrado, o que Lucille estaba sentada a horcajadas sobre su pecho y le apuntaba con un cuchillo, con lágrimas resbalando por sus mejillas, repitiendo una y otra vez que era un «puto traidor». Ese tipo de sueño se había reducido considerablemente en los últimos meses, ayudaba bastante que se encontraran en un clima más cálido y lejos de Allerdale Halle. Escuchó pasos detrás de él y un ruido sordo escaleras abajo. A alguien se le habría caído algo, quizá un cubierto. Era la hora del desayuno, recordó de pronto. Miró el conjunto que había elegido para ese día, y suspiró aliviado. Sí, era todo un alivio darse cuenta de lo mucho que había mejorado en esos meses, porque ya no vivía con la sensación de que alguien, en cualquier momento, iba a saltarle encima. Ya no tenía que cerrar los ojos y dejar que ella hiciera lo que quisiera con él, o rezar todos los malditos días para que ocurriera un milagro, para que a Lucille no se le fuera la cabeza más todavía . Unos brazos cálidos rodearon su cintura aún desnuda. Thomas se permitió unos segundos de tranquilidad; se relajó en su toque, sobre todo cuando Edith descansó la mejilla en su espalda y lo abrazó con un poquito más de fuerza de la necesaria, un claro recordatorio de que estaba aquí y no iba a irse a ninguna parte. Eso le rompió y le reconstruyó el corazón a partes iguales. Tomó una de sus manos, delicada y preciosa, a pesar de la cicatriz que estropeaba su piel, y le dio un tierno beso. —¿Se te han pegado las sábanas, señor Sharpe? —ronroneó divertida, y Thomas no pudo evitar reír en respuesta—. El desayuno está listo desde hace quince minutos. —Qué descortés por mi parte el retraso. —Se le perdona, porque era por fuerza mayor —continuó con su broma, con ese tonito que le ponía de los nervios, pero que adoraba terriblemente—. ¿Y bien? ¿Es atractivo su reflejo en el espejo o aún no le convence? Thomas volvió a mirar el espejo de cuerpo entero que tenían en la habitación. Había sido su idea mantenerlo, a pesar de las protestas de Edith. Una especie de castigo. Tal vez era un pelín masoquista, aunque el tiempo le había dado razón. Ver su reflejo todos los días era un paso más cerca del perdón. No obstante, esta vez no se fijó en la cicatriz que destrozaba parte de su rostro ni el parche negro que cubría su ojo inútil, sino en su esposa, que se había puesto de puntillas y se asomaba por encima de su hombro. Con claras dificultades, por supuesto. Fue inevitable sonreír, tanto como volverse y atrapar el rostro de Edith entre sus manos, ahora callosas por el trabajo diario. Era preciosa. Tremendamente atractiva. —¿Va a besarme? —cuestionó con calma, pero el brillo en sus ojos decía todo lo contrario. —Vas a besarme —respondió, y se mordió el labio inferior al verla arrugar la nariz. Dios, la amaba con locura. —Qué osado —se burló, antes de rodear su cuello con los brazos e inclinarse para robarle un beso. Fue dulce, casto y perfecto. Un «buenos días» en toda regla con un poquito de «te he echado de menos, aunque nos hubiéramos visto hacía un rato». Thomas apoyó su frente sobre la de Edith. No fue capaz de cerrar los ojos, no teniendo esa visión dorada justo delante. Con cuidado, porque todavía sentía que no era merecedor de tanta bondad y amor, acarició su rostro con los nudillos de los dedos. Edith se estremeció imperceptiblemente, porque él siempre tenía la piel un poquito fría, un efecto secundario de haber estado muerto durante unos minutos, y se mordió el labio inferior, quizá con demasiada fuerza. A él no le importaba, iba a quitarle esa manía a besos, si hacía falta. —A Theresa no va a hacerle gracia que la hagamos esperar… —murmuró sin convicción contra sus labios—. Lo digo en serio, no le gusta que se le enfríe el desayuno. —Es nuestra cocinera, no una aya —aclaró, por si acaso a Edith se le había olvidado ese pequeño detalle. Su esposa negó con la cabeza—. Ahora soy yo quien lo dice en serio, cualquier día nos da una colleja por no terminar la comida. Edith soltó una carcajada tan fuerte que tuvo que doblarse. Fue una carcajada nada digna de una dama de su clase. Ese pensamiento, tan poco frecuente en su nueva vida, le sorprendió, pero desapareció tan rápido como vino. A él ya no le importaban los códigos de comportamiento de la sociedad, no ahora que tenía una segunda oportunidad, así que, si su esposa quería reírse así, él lo haría también. Le limpió las lágrimas con los pulgares, le dio un beso en la mejilla, porque no podía no besarla estando justo allí, y le ofreció su brazo, como todo un caballero, para salir de allí. Tal vez hoy podrían fingir que no tenían un manuscrito que terminar ni varios juguetes que hacer, y podrían disfrutar un día en los Campos Elíseos. —Cariño, aunque me encante verte semidesnudo, dudo que Theresa sea de la misma opinión. —¿Disculpa? —Edith le miró de arriba a abajo, recordándole de una forma muy curiosa que estaba sin vestir—. Cierto, ¿qué haría sin ti? —Te veo abajo —dijo, ignorando su anterior pregunta. Thomas suspiró y se quedó unos segundos de más contemplando la puerta cerrada. Era feliz. Era una realidad innegable, eso seguro, pero no podía deshacerse de la sensación de que era temporal, que enseguida algo o alguien quebraría su burbuja y le devolvería al vacío de sombras y polillas del que no tendría que haber escapado nunca. Sacudió la cabeza, para apartar esos oscuros pensamientos de su mente, que se quedaran en el agujero en el que se encontraban normalmente. Cogió los pantalones de la silla, y se dispuso a empezar su día con buen pie. XXX Thomas se cubrió la boca con una servilleta para que la señora Bertrand —su encantadora vecina— no le viera sonreír a su costa, mientras evitaba, a su vez, todo lo sutilmente que podía, dadas las circunstancias, la traicionera patada que su esposa le propinó en la espinilla, desde el otro lado de la mesa. Edith era una mujer con recursos. Y una actriz fantástica, porque sonreía cuando tenía que sonreír y asentía cuando debía, ni antes ni después. Era eso, o que verdaderamente estaba escuchando a la señora Bertrand hablando del parto de su perra, mientras tomaban una merienda en un café que daba a los Campos Elíseos, sin que le dieran nauseas. —Sois tan jóvenes —lloriqueó la mujer, mientras mordisqueaba una galleta. Qué desperdicio de comida—, os vendría bien la compañía. ¿Qué estaba diciendo? Había estado tan concentrado en el dolor de su pierna que había perdido el hilo de la conversación. Le dio una mirada a su esposa, pidiendo ayuda, pero la señora Sharpe decidió que era una fantástica idea dejarle en la estacada. Qué traición por su parte. Una crueldad absoluta. —Quizá os guste Cleo, es la más juguetona de todas. Definitivo, había perdido el hilo de la conversación, o a la señora Bertrand se le iba la cabeza de vez en cuando. Edith se apiadó de él en cuanto su vecina le miró, esperando una respuesta o una intervención por su parte. Thomas estuvo tentado de beber un sorbo de su café y fingir que se ahogaba, pero no lo vio apropiado. —¿Y bien, querido? —intervino Edith, con una sonrisa suave—. ¿Queremos adoptar a Cleo, uno de sus cachorros? Oh, eso sí tiene sentido . —Ganaréis práctica para cuando tengáis a vuestro primogénito. —Supongo que Cleo será más fácil que un bebé —respondió Thomas, ahora que se sentía más seguro, pero arrepintiéndose a los dos segundos, al recordar que él sí tuvo un primogénito y que Lucille lo asfixió una noche que la dejó sola meciendo al bebé. Edith tuvo que darse cuenta del camino que tomaron sus pensamientos, porque le dio suavemente con el pie en el mismo sitio donde le había pateado. —¿Entonces? —dudó la señora Bertrand, al comprender que se estaba perdiendo algo crucial, una conversación que ocurría a través de miradas significativas y caricias invisibles—. ¿Se quedarán con Cleo? —Sí —dijo por fin. —¡Es una magnífica noticia! —aplaudió, extasiada—. Oh, queridos, si me disculpan, tengo quehaceres pendientes. —Ha sido un placer tomar un café con usted, señora Bertrand. Thomas asintió de acuerdo, porque no quería mentirle en su cara. —Deberías de venir un día a tomar el té en mi casa. —Edith se tensó—. El café no puede ser bueno para un caballero inglés como usted, señor Sharpe. Thomas hizo un ruido no comprometedor, a modo de respuesta. —Bueno… —comenzó a decir, poco después de que la señora Bertrand desapareciera de su vista—. No ha ido tan mal, ¿no? Tenemos un perro ahora. Thomas quería disculparse por el té y el veneno, decirle que él nunca quiso que ocurriera, pero se reprendió un segundo después. Ya habían tenido esa conversación cientos de veces y siempre acababa de la misma forma, y no quería borrarle la sonrisa a Edith, no cuando era tan encantadora y hermosa. Su esposa no pretendía ser feliz, lo era. —¿Pedimos otro plato? Siento que no he saboreado nada. —¿Cómo vas a saborear, Edith, si la señora Bertrand comía como un pajarito? Los dos se echaron a reír sin importarles el lugar ni el momento. Estaban juntos. XXX Thomas dormitaba con un libro entre las manos; libro que amenazaba con acabar en el suelo en cualquier momento. Se había pasado toda la noche en vela arreglando el mecanismo de un juguete que le había ocasionado más de un dolor de cabeza, porque no terminaba de funcionar adecuadamente. Fue inevitable entonces que, al día siguiente, durante la tarde, acabase durmiendo en el sofá de la salita. Aunque no fuera el lugar más confortable de la casa, que no lo era. Cleo se paseó a su alrededor, moviendo la cola enérgicamente. Era aún demasiado pequeña para dar un salto en condiciones hasta el sofá, así que optó por vigilar los sueños de su amo desde el suelo. No apartó la mirada en ningún momento, como si temiera que su amo desapareciera si osaba hacerlo. Estuvo así al menos unos minutos, hasta que, Thomas, en un descuido, dejó caer la mano al suelo. Cleo fue muy feliz, por supuesto, porque ahora podía demostrarle su amor a base de pequeños lametones y caricias con la cabeza. Thomas se removió, ocasionando que el libro cayera al suelo, asustando al pobre animalillo, que ladró ruidosamente. Thomas parpadeó confundido y desorientado. Tardó un segundo de más en comprender lo que estaba pasando y donde se encontraba. Se llevó una mano al bolsillo de su chaleco, liberando así su reloj. Era tardísimo. No tuvo tiempo de maldecir entre dientes por su despiste, uno que no podía repetirse, ¡no era un niño!, porque Cleo seguía lloriqueando en el suelo. —Pero ¿qué…? —Thomas frunció el ceño, antes de erguirse en el sofá y recoger al cachorro del suelo. Cleo se dejó acariciar feliz y, como prueba de su eterno agradecimiento y amor, lamió la barbilla y la mejilla de su amo, ganándose más mimos. Un negocio redondo—. Eres muy caprichosa, ¿eh? Cleo ladró de nuevo. —Sí, una muchacha muy caprichosa y que necesita muchísima atención. —El cachorro se dejó querer un rato más, hasta que otra cosa captó su atención y se removió para zafarse del agarre de su amo, quien la liberó nada más le dio un beso en el hocico—. Anda, ve, que seguro que has olido tu comida. Thomas se pasó una mano por el pelo y suspiró. La cena estaría servida en un rato. ¿Cómo podía haber dormido tanto? No quiso darle muchas vueltas, y decidió que sería una idea magnífica averiguar dónde estaba metida Edith. Empezaría por el despacho, no sería extraño que llevara allí toda la tarde con la máquina de escribir. Eran tal para cual. XXX Edith llamó a la puerta, dos toques suaves contra la madera, antes de entrar. Sonrió complacida al ver el desastre que era la sala de trabajo de Thomas. Había un patrón escondido allí, uno que todavía no había alcanzado a descifrar. Se preguntó vagamente cómo lo hacía su marido para encontrar algo allí, en una habitación repleta de juguetes y piezas irreconocibles, donde las paredes estaban llenas de dibujos y bocetos a medio acabar. Era un lugar hermoso, concluyó, mientras paseaba la mirada por cada centímetro cuadrado, un paraíso donde gobernaba un caos hasta un cierto punto controlado por su soberano. También, para qué negarlo, una copia de su refugio en Allerdale Hale, pero diferente al mismo tiempo. Apretó el fajo de documentos que el doctor Hiddleston le había dado una hora atrás contra su pecho, armándose de valor. Estaba nerviosa y preocupada a partes iguales, a pesar de saber que era una estupidez. Llevaban años juntos, se conocían a la perfección y Thomas no iba a reaccionar mal ante la noticia. No obstante, tomó aire antes de hacerse notar, porque su marido estaba sentado con las piernas cruzadas y le daba la espalda. Hizo un gesto con una mano, pidiéndole un minuto y ella se acercó, y tomó asiento a su lado, recogiéndose el vestido. —¿Todo bien? —preguntó, mientras recuperaba un trapo para limpiarse el aceite de las manos. —Te mentí esta mañana —le confesó en voz baja, captando su atención. Thomas alzó una ceja, curioso, aunque no preocupado. Era un alivio, porque no se veía capaz de ver el terror en sus ojos azules una vez más. —¿Sobre qué? —Sobre lo que iba a hacer esta mañana. No fui al mercado de antigüedades —aclaró, mordiéndose el labio inferior un segundo después—. Tenía cita con el doctor Hiddleston. Thomas se tensó. —¿Es sobre…? ¿Hay algún problema con el veneno? ¿Restos? —Habían pasado dos años, mas no sería nada raro que hubiera efectos secundarios a largo plazo. Era algo que había perseguido a su esposo como una sombra desde que abandonaron Inglaterra. —¡No! No, cariño, perdona. —Le acarició la mejilla con ternura y se inclinó para darle un beso en los labios—. Nada que ver, te lo prometo. Toma. Le dio el sobre con los documentos. El doctor le había recomendado que le dijera la noticia directamente, sin ceremonias, que ayudaba decirlo en voz alta. Edith no se sentía capaz de abrir la boca todavía. No se veía real y no quería que Thomas no reaccionase bien. ¿Y si su marido no se veía capacitado para ser padre? ¿Y si..? —Cariño, ¿qué hay aquí? —preguntó en un susurro, temiendo que subir el volumen supusiera un problema. Edith estaba pálida—. Edith, estamos juntos, ¿recuerdas? En lo bueno y… y en lo malo. —No es malo —se obligó a decir—, es solo que… —¿Qué? —Le tembló la voz, a pesar de sus intentos de mantenerse de una pieza—. Estoy aquí. Hasta el final. Edith le miró un momento, y asintió medio convencida. —Estoy… estamos… —Edith negó con la cabeza, exasperada—. Vamos a ser papás, Thomas. Thomas no supo qué decir al respecto. Estaba literalmente sin palabras. Su corazón iba a mil por hora y su cabeza era incapaz de pensar en otra cosa que no fuera Lucille abrazando con fuerza a su hijo hasta la muerte. Edith, ajena a sus cavilaciones sin sentido, a sus fantasmas que siempre le acompañaban, se estremeció a su lado y agachó el rostro, para evitar que él se diera cuenta de que estaba llorando. A Thomas se le estrujó el corazón y se le atoró la garganta al sentir el dolor de su esposa, de su preciosa mariposa dorada. Estaba malinterpretando su silencio y él no estaba haciendo nada para evitarlo. Cleo ladró desde el quicio de la puerta, tenía la lengua fuera y movía la cola con mucho ímpetu, les decía, a su manera, que estaban siendo unos idiotas y que tendrían que estar dando saltos de alegría, porque le iban a dar un hermanito humano con el que jugar y al cual proteger de las sombras que acechaban por la noche. Thomas sonrió, fue una sonrisa genuina, llamando la atención de una sorprendida Edith, que no supo qué decir o hacer. —Cleo —la llamó, dando un golpecito a su lado, la aludida no tardó ni medio segundo en ponerse en medio de ambos y en acurrucarse en las faldas de Edith—. Voy a ser papá —le susurró, al borde de las lágrimas. Cleo le dio un lametón—. ¡Vamos a ser papás! Edith ahogó un sollozo, y se tapó el rostro con las manos. Thomas no se lo permitió, la abrazó contra su pecho. —No hagas esto, no te ocultes, por favor… —murmuró contra su pelo, saboreando su champú y aquello que era completamente de ella—. Lo siento tanto, mi amor. Estoy aterrorizado, pero estamos juntos, ¿recuerdas? Seremos unos padres fantásticos, mejores que los míos. Edith asintió frenéticamente sin dejar de llorar. Thomas repartió besos por su pelo, mientras acariciaba su espalda. Un tonto consuelo para ambos, pero que funcionaba a la perfección. Habían sobrevivido a un infierno, llevaban años siguiendo adelante, apreciando la belleza del mundo, el regalo que suponía despertar cada día al lado del otro. No podían rendirse ahora. No podían dejar que el infierno ganara esa batalla. Nadie podría arrebatarles su segunda oportunidad. Ni ahora ni nunca. —Te quiero, mi dulce Edith. Y querré a nuestro bebé con la misma intensidad. fin notas de autora Gracias por tomaros unos minutos para leer esta historia.

There was more money on display here than he or his family had touched in years, even before Papa— Thomas cut off that thought almost before it had begun, closing it down as he had learned to close his eyes to all memories that led in the direction of his parents. Across the table his sister Lucille sat poised and calm, her smiling society mask a flawless shield over the bitterness beneath. Silent amid the dinner-table chatter, Thomas watched her, remembering that cheek with its exquisite curve bent over the blackened porridge-pot at home or flushed with heat as she thrust the kettle on its chain across the fire. His hand found the great garnet ring — the ring that was to have made their fortunes tonight — where it still lay concealed in his pocket, and tightened about it until it hurt. She deserved better. She deserved what the other women at this table had, women like glittering high-nosed Eunice McMichael who had never had to lay hand to a hot skillet in her life. Lovely Lucille deserved better than to be enslaved to a decaying house that was slipping away from them year by year, no matter how he tried... but tonight was the night that should have set an end to that, one last push to revive their livelihood and save their home, and instead the moment had been cut short in humiliation and the threat of exposure. There had been a time, a hundred years ago, when it was the Sharpes of Allerdale Hall who paid off fortune-hunters. The cheque in Lucille's reticule — not enough, it was never enough, but all the same a sum sufficient to represent an insult — conveyed the full force of the contempt with which they were regarded here. The moment had been ripe to ask Edith Cushing to marry him. Edith herself, shy, stubborn, inkstained Edith, had been ripe. And he, Sir Thomas Sharpe, Baronet, had allowed her father to bribe him to stay away from her. It was not as if they'd had a choice. Lucille, calm and collected, only her eyes blazing in her white face, had taken the cheque. And the damning evidence of his London marriage lines — with Miss Pamela Upton, spinster — had lain there in the dossier in black and white. He tried not to think of Pamela when they were at Allerdale. He tried not to think of any of them any more. But he could have played out the grieving widower for Edith's father if he'd known... had known that Cushing knew . Only Cushing had set an enquiry agent on them to gather evidence, and there was no evidence that Pamela was gone. Evidence that would damn him in eyes far beyond those of the girl he wanted and of her father; evidence that would lead him to a quick death and Lucille to a long lingering end, for what they had done and what they were. He could not let them take Lucille. Not ever, not again. And so he'd let Cushing think him a scoundrel and worse, because the truth could not be spoken or thought about, not even between themselves. Cushing had laid down conditions, and there had been nothing that they could do. No doubt the big American would wax expansive in future at his club: just a couple of British adventurers... You can bet I sent them packing — there's no flies on Carter Cushing... \"Carter by name and carter by nature,\" Lucille had said scornfully, after that first failed investment meeting, when Thomas had had to come to her with the news. \"As proud of his plain speaking as of his rough hands — and fool enough to confuse both with merit.\" But Cushing had been no fool. And he loved his Edith as Papa had never cared for either of them. Oh, why would they not listen , these men with their fat purses and their precious possessions? If they had only listened in London when all he sought was financial backing, Lucille need never have come up with her plan and he need never have smiled back at lonely, frail Pamela Upton or answered the pathetic appeal in her eyes... The mines could be made to pay again, he was sure of it. He had not asked for charity, not in London or Edinburgh or Milan. He had asked only for the same hearing they would have given any sound business proposition, and every time they had turned him away as a dilettante peddling castles in the sky. And what had followed was on their hands as much as his. He had tried. Again and again, he had tried. Men like Cushing who looked down on him did not know the unforgiveable depths of what he had done — but did they suppose he took any pride in selling himself and his name, when it was all he had left... or that Lucille would have endured such a travesty of her own free will if he had had any other way of giving her hope? Carter Cushing had never trusted him, not from the first. And now he sat silent at Cushing's table with the man's ultimatum wedged in his throat, trying not to meet Edith's eyes. There was a shy, eager little smile in her face whenever her gaze sought his, and her father was watching them both. Dinner had never seemed more interminable, nor innocence harder to bear. When Cushing as host finally rose to his feet and rang his fork against a glass for attention, for once Thomas was genuinely grateful to the man. He had not expected to be called upon to address the assembled company. But it seemed Sir Thomas and Lucille Sharpe were to be given the grace to concoct their own polite fiction to cover an enforced departure — an open scandal, after all, would never do. Just at the present moment Thomas could not honestly say that he would greatly miss either America or the Americans. All the same, he stood with a smile to make his excuses, affirming the necessary falsehoods with the charming heartfelt ease of a lifetime he seemed to have spent in doing little else. Urgent affairs in England — regret — everlasting appreciation and warmth — and all the time he could see the colour draining from Edith's small stricken face. He had lied to her against his will so often before, in things that mattered and those that did not, but this time... this time, she knew it for untruth. Even so it was not enough. He had to hurt her worse now, if he could. Cushing had paid him to leave... and to ensure he tore himself out of her heart in a way that she would never forgive. Lucille's cool eyes were on him, waiting for his move. She at least had never seen Edith as anything but a necessary evil to save face and fortune for them both in the eyes of the world; the sooner the girl was done with, the happier she would be. As children they'd been locked for punishment in the old linen-cupboard by the stairs. He could still feel the fierce comfort of her arms shielding a small Thomas from the dark, and remember the crack of their mother's cane across her thin back. The two of them had had so very little beside one another, and Lucille had shared with him as he grew everything that she had and everything that she was. She was the one person who had loved him, always, without question or judgement, and the only one to believe in his talents and his dreams. She had been his confederate, his confessor, his consolation, and the controlling spirit in all that they had done. Edith thought herself in love with him. But she did not know him across the years as Lucille did. All Edith knew was the fairytale he had given her. Love of me won't break your heart, sweet Edith, not truly. I'm hurting you now with falsehoods, but truth is the only thing that cannot be forgiven. And the truth is that writing means more to you than I do... and that even there you are too fresh and innocent to know anything of love. It would be easy enough to spin some tale of betrayal and tell Edith that he preferred, say, Eunice McMichael with her sophistication and her London polish and poise. He thought he could even bring her to believe it — poor little Cinderella, she still set too little value on her own charms. But that would not shatter her world as he had been ordered to shatter it. He had to wound her far more deeply, and in a place where she thought herself secure. Reluctantly, Thomas knew just where he would have to drive the blade. She had talent with her pen: real talent that had caught his attention on the day that they first met. He'd learned long since of the lovely flush of colour that rose beneath her fair skin in response to praise of her work, and thereafter made a point of giving her the appreciation she deserved. If he told her now the unvarnished truth — that the strand of romance she'd tried to add in for crowd-pleasing appeal was lifeless, cardboard stuff, cribbed from cheap novels by a girl whose own inexperience showed in every word — she would never be able to endure his presence again. And Carter Cushing's price would be amply paid. Cushing's big hand had dropped to grip his daughter's shoulder where she sat, whether in warning or in comfort Thomas did not know. A moment later, quivering lips pressed tight, she had twisted free and fled the room. Thomas took a deep breath and followed, to do what had to be done. It was not the scene he'd planned to play out with Edith tonight. Forgive me, Edith. But your father has your best interests at heart — more so than he knows. You should never have become involved with Thomas Sharpe. Never. Love was not a gossamer schoolgirl confection. It sank deep into you and held you fast through death and through desire with a drowning force. It burned and betrayed and led into torment those whom it bound. Love could drive men to things that were monstrous to contemplate. Edith Cushing knew nothing of that power as yet, and heaven forbid she should. He caught up with her at the foot of the stairs, though the little lost look of dignity in her face pleaded with him to let her be. Forcing the truth down her gullet hurt more than he had thought it would, but he could not afford to spare either of them. He was doing her a mercy, though she did not know it. She would learn and grow with time. In the end, she would write better than before, write books that would never have come to pass in his clutches, and he... he would be sunken yet deeper into infamy than he was now. The other guests were gathering. Cushing would not avoid a scandal after all; so much the worse for him. As for Edith, she would never know just what an escape she had had. No doubt in time she would turn to Dr Alan McMichael, the faithful swain who had been waiting for her all along... But it was not the accusation in the eyes of the young doctor, foremost among the crowd, that stayed with him afterwards into the dark watches of the night. It was that last glimpse of Edith Cushing, who had struck him and fled; Edith Cushing, whom he had told himself — told Lucille — he was courting for her money in cold blood, whom he could not, should not love without worse horrors for them both. ~o~ Sleep came to him late, and heavily. He was wakened by Lucille's hot breath against his own, and the urgency of her hands. It was broad daylight and not safe; he tried to turn away, but she was feverish, insistent, and he had never been able to refuse her. He yielded, with a gasp. Presently there was nothing but Lucille, and oblivion. It was not until afterwards that he saw the bloodstains amid the discarded clothes and on her black gloves. But he'd known somehow, on some level, all along. Death excited Lucille. It always had, right from the start. He did not want to know, but he must. \"Lucille, who—\" Sated now, she stretched cat-like and settled against him, hair spilling across his arm. \"Mr Carter Everett Cushing\"—her voice was creamy and slow—\"will not insult us again. I shall leave on the first train, as agreed. And you, dear brother, can take Edith... just as we planned.\" \"I—\" The chill of realisation was still spreading, joined now by a stab of nausea. He had renounced her. He had not meant for this to happen. \"I— no. No.\" \"What do you mean, No?\" Lucille's tone sharpened and she sat up abruptly. \"It was you who wanted Edith. I tried to tell you she was unsuitable, but you insisted. Well, now she's perfect. She's an orphan. She's rich. She has no close family left. Play your cards right, and it'll be you she turns to for comfort: your arm she clings to, your hand outstretched to whisk her away from tragedy and into a new life far from here. Maidens in distress are your speciality, Thomas... or had you forgotten?\" She laughed and reached across to stroke his cheek as she had done when they were children, the reassuring big sister once more. Thomas bit his lip and was silent, watching her dress quickly and neatly, ready to slip back to her own room. She'd gone out in man's clothes before, but they could not afford for these discarded garments to be seen or linked to her in any way. He would have to find some means to dispose of them later, once she had left... Their world had begun to settle imperceptibly back onto its old axis, almost without his willing it: she first to take the initiative, he in loyal support. Above all, they protected one another. Cushing was dead. But Cushing had disliked him on sight, and Edith's father or not, he had not greatly cared for Cushing either. Cushing was dead and gone, and Lucille must be protected. And Lucille had offered him Edith. No. No. He shied away from that temptation again almost violently, with a resolution that ebbed even as he sought to bolster it up. The one thing worthwhile about last night, the one thing in which he could take a shred of pride out of all that he had done to her, was that Edith was safe. She would not be safe with Lucille. She would not be safe at Allerdale Hall. She would not be safe at all from the moment her name appeared on the marriage certificate next to that of Thomas Sharpe... But the vision swam before him, seductive in its colours. She would be alone now, young and unmarried in New York State, where well-bred society looked askance at inky fingers and fanciful tales in place of a wedding ring. How long could her stolid young doctor save her from the spite of his own sister, Eunice, and her set? She did not love the faithful Dr McMichael. Not any more; not yet. Thomas knew with a painful clarity that for all the wounds he had dealt her yesterday, he could have Edith back if he lifted one finger to call. The truth about last night would do it... or almost the truth. He had only to confess her father's bribe and his own penury, avow regret and eternal constancy, and he could have her for the taking. If he wanted her. Honey-fair Edith, with her quick intelligence and her stubborn streak, her innocence and her dreams; he knew now that he wanted her in his life with an entirely selfish urgency, to warm his cold hearth with optimism and unclouded affection and to lift the shadows with her brightness. He could picture the tenderness of her within his arm, clinging close for comfort, as Lucille had said — and why should he not comfort her? He had not caused her father's death, he had not willed it or wanted it, but the very least he could do was help make things easier for her amid the devastation that must follow. He could take care of her in the days to come; shield her from the worst of whatever had been done. He could be her world, for a while. Beyond that... he would find a way, he told himself, eyes closed firmly to the past. She was not like the others. She was stubborn and determined, like Lucille; she was a dreamer and a maker like himself. She held the best of them both. The machine was so very close to being finished, and once that was done they would no longer be in need of money. Edith could be the last, and all this could be over. It need not change anything for Lucille. Surely she would see that? All he had to do was follow the path she had marked out for him, as always, and let things take their course. Once he got Edith back to England it would all work out. The door closed softly behind his sister. Thomas slipped out of bed, and padded barefoot across the room to the writing-table where Edith's manuscript still lay, packaged for its return. Drawing up pen and paper he began to write, fluently and without pause, not allowing himself to consider what he was doing. At the back of his mind, voices shrieked of madness and a red clay vat. But life was short and happiness briefer yet, and he paid no heed.

Esta situado en 1932. Disclaimer : \"La Cumbre Escarlata\" no me pertenece, sino a Guillermo del Toro y su magnifico talento; la pelicula es protagonizada por Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain y Charlie Hunnam. Esta historia (el fic) sí es de mi pertenencia, al igual que un personaje dentro de ella. A veces, más bien todas las veces, Edtih se arrepentía de ese involuntario y despreocupado deseo. Aquel que le dijo a la señora McMichael en las escaleras. \"-Prefiero ser como Mary Shelley-dijo-Murió viuda\" Se había jactado de silenciar a la madre de su mejor amigo, creyendo que podía comerse el mundo por el solo saber que tenía algo que otros no. Una escritora de fantasmas. Similar a Mary Shelley (salvo que en su escrito original no habia ningun Prometeo Moderno). Pero ahora tenía 55 años, era 1932. La edad hacia mella en ella, y el tiempo pasó aunque no quiso. Su mayor obra, \"La Cumbre Escarlata\" fue la más exitosa de sus novelas de fantasmas. Al salir a la calle de su adorado Buffalo, la gente le reconocía y pedía un tiempo para hablar con ella, en especial varias jóvenes que se interesaron en el campo de lo sobrenatural en la literatura. Debía sentirse feliz de abrirles las puertas a esta sociedad. Debía...pero no podía. Porque su primera novela, es su propio recordatorio de lo que perdió. A diferencia del resto, ella sabía que esos muertos eran reales, porque lo vivió . Como su protagonista (su persona misma) perdió a su padre, por poco la cordura, la dignidad y la inocencia. Pero principalmente, lo perdió a él. Perdió a Thomas. Lo que hubo entre ellos fue real. Él la amo, y ella...Edtih seguía amándolo. Contrario a las expectativas, no se casó con Alan McMichael. No lo quería como una especie de \"plan de reserva\", o usar el enamoramiento que él tenía por la, entonces, joven. No era mezquina (como lo fue cierto par de hermanos) solo para evitar que la sociedad la juzgará. No podía casarse con Alan, porque jamás lo amaría. Siempre sería (y es) el mejor y más leal de los amigos. Pero como amante y esposo no podría verlo ni sentirlo jamás. Alan se casó con una dama, una que su madre aprobó y, con el tiempo, se fueron enamorando el uno del otro. Se sentía feliz por él. Por su lado, al principio, al volver a EEUU la gente habló mal de ella. Todo por regresar al brazo de otro que no era su esposo. Pero Alan fue listo y tergiverso los hechos: hubo un problema con el invento de Sir Thomas, que al final le costó la vida misma. Su hermana, Lucille, decidió salir a buscar un marido, perdiéndose entre la sociedad europea. La viuda, fue abandonada en la mansión, hasta que el doctor la encontró moribunda, con síntomas de envenenamientto por el agua de lugar. Con el tiempo, las personas se lo creyeron, compadeciéndose de la viuda Sharpe...Cushing, decidió usar su apellido de soltera. Aunque deseará seguir usando el apellido de Thomas, también lo era de Lucille. Y ya no quería nada que ver con esa psicopata. Como señaló, el tiempo pasó. La fama siguió, la lástima igual. Edith deseaba tener una razón para no dejarse guiar por la tristeza. La tuvo. Nueve meses después de su retorno. De cabello negro, piel blanca lechosa y carita adorable. Carter. Carter Cushing...Sharpe. Con los años, sus ojos azules fueron la razón de que siguiera adelante. Al crecer, a sus diecisiete años ya era la viva imagen de su padre. Porte, encanto. Pero tenía su curiosidad por lo paranormal. Bastante sarcástico en ocasiones. Noble de corazón. Y lamentablemente, llegaba a ser ingenuo. Fue su soporte, en las noches heladas, siendo su compañia. Sus bracitos rodeándole. Las risas en las mañanas y noches, los desayunos, paseos y cuando le leía a la hora que quisiera. Carter era su ángel de la guarda. Carecía de la maldad que se había visto, potencialmente en Lucille Sharpe. -Madre-su voz...también era igual. Giró la cabeza, antes inclinada para revisar el manuscrito del joven adulto a su lado. Aparentaba una máscara de indiferencia, sintiendo ganas de tranquilizar a su hijo, quién movía las manos nerviosamente. -Es...-estiró la palabra. Vio al joven tragar aaliva y no pudo evitar reír, desconcertándolo-Es mágnifico. -¿En..serio? -Una historia que inicia como un un caso policial, y en el transcurso se descubre que en realidad es de...¿cómo se llamaba?-pregunto la mujer al pelinegro. -Ciencia ficción-respondió. -¡Eso!-chasqueó los dedos, de manera juguetona-Es sorprendente, nuevo, se ve mucho potencial-los ojos azules se iluminaron por los aplausos de su madre e ídola-Pero...solo evita que no sea tan abrupto el cambio-recomendó. -Eso haré madre-prometió, dándole un beso en la mejilla, emocionado. Edith sonrió al ver al joven ya imaginándose un futuro éxito. Para ella era el primer paso que daría al mundo mezquino de la literatura. En el momento que su hijo iba a dormir, Edith se sumía en sus fantasmas del pasado. Volvía a repetir el momento en que le dijo a la, ya fallecida, señora McMichael que prefería ser viuda (como Mary Shelley), y como, minutos después, su deseo se vio cumplido. Encarnado en la figura de Sir Thomas Sharpe. Era viuda como Mary Shelley. Felicidades Edith. Pero ¿se arrepentía de haberse casado con él? No. ¿Se arrepentía de cómo se entregaron el uno al otro? No. ¿Se arrepentía de haberlo amado y seguir haciéndolo, a pesar del infierno que la metió?...No. ¿Se arrepentía del joven que vino en su vientre y que era la viva imagen de su padre? Absolutamente no. Y cuando finalmente se iba a dormir, recostándose y apagando la luz. Repetía muy convencida de que no se arrepentía. -Te amo, Thomas-musito a la nada, para después quedarse dormida. ...ya en la paz del sueño, una figura blanca acarició el rostro envejecido de Edtih. -Y yo te amo a ti, Edith-deja al aire, antes de desvanecerse. De seguro dirán que el final es \"diabetico\" o demasiado dulce, pero...ame escribirlo XD Espero les haya gustado la lectura, y también esperen una futura continuación que tengo preparada. También vean mis otros fics por sí les interesa. ¡Gracias por leer! Sayonara. Goodbye. Tschuws.

He'd come here to take her away from the husband who was no husband and his sister who was no sister — and hadn't she called herself \"Lady Lucille\", and openly, mocking American naïvety as the fresh love-marks on her neck mocked at Edith's stolen wedding-ring? He'd come here full of crusading passion to rip down the veils of deception and to bring Edith back into safety and sunlight. And now it came to him instead in blind disbelief that he was going to die. Blood oozed between his fingers, heavy and dark, where Lucille had sunk her knife into him up to the hilt. Blood, his own blood, mesmerised him on that same approaching blade, caught up from where he had dropped it on the snow. His left arm was numb and the blow had somehow robbed him of all coherent thought, but a small, trained part of his mind told him axillary vein from behind the shock. If he could not stem the bleeding he was going to die, as surely as if the artery itself had been hit... but he was not going to be allowed long enough for that to matter. He watched his death come towards him. Sir Thomas's eyes were pale and intent in that odd, angular face of his, cheekbones too high and too narrow beneath swept-back dark hair — as great a contrast to his own squared-off fair features as night to day — and his gaze held the same unflinching focus as the blood-stained dagger in his hand. Fey , Alan thought, remembering a word from the old country. The man was fey. There was nowhere left to run. Alan had spent his strength on the few staggering steps that took him to the door, to thrust it open on the whirling blizzard beyond with Edith's name falling broken from his lips. But there was no escape for her that way, not with a shattered leg set barely half an hour before, and the drifts outside offered no hope for him. It was all he could do to hold his ground and watch Thomas Sharpe approach, and face the other man's eyes in defiance to the last. \"If I don't do it, she will,\" Sir Thomas said softly, with the pained unreason of a man explaining away the inevitable. \"But listen to me—\" Alan had closed his eyes, willing it to be over. There was no point in arguing with insanity. He felt the kiss of the knife, and a grip on his arm, urgent and oddly insistent. When he looked up, the other man's face was very close to his own. \"You're a doctor,\" Sir Thomas whispered, as if promising a favour. \"Show me where.\" For a moment Alan could only stare at him, the jolt of comprehension running cold along his spine. It was the coaxing note one would use on a small child: now, just hold still, and this won't hurt. One quick prick, and it'll all be over in a minute. .. There, that would be the place for it: between the fourth and fifth rib, upwards and a little to the right. Quick and clean without a struggle, if he were to consent... No. He began to shake his head, mutely, refusing his enemy the comfort of acquiescence; read something else in the pale, strained features that was not swift mercy after all. Or not of that sort. Somewhere that will look good. Somewhere that will make a show of murder, and not kill... I must be mad. As mad as he is, even to be considering this. But it was a chance. A chance for Edith. Let Lucille believe him dead, and there was a chance, a fragment of hope, that they might all come out of this alive. If Sir Thomas could be trusted. And every document they had found — and Edith's deadly fall, the scent of alkali in the tea — bore witness that he could not. Only it seemed that the man she had married carried Edith's name in his eyes and in his heart, even as Alan himself did, and that instant of knowledge tugged across the gulf between them. ~o~ As if from a great distance Alan saw his own bloodied fingers guide the knife-point across the map of his waistcoat. It halted above the watch-fob. Twelfth rib, he thought. Away from the lungs. Away from the viscera. He ran through the major arteries in his mind, and counted them all safe, more or less. One could take a thrust in the liver and survive, with reasonable luck... but the anticipation of it was the hardest thing he had ever done. He set his jaw. He'd give up his life for Edith in a heartbeat, wouldn't he, if he thought it would do any good? The answer came back an unswerving Yes, and steadied him a little. If he could do that, he could do this. An eternity seemed to have passed, but it could only have been a few seconds. Somewhere out of sight in the hall, the little dog was choking out its last whimpers beneath unmerciful fingers, and he could hear Edith's quick, sobbing breath. He searched the other's expression one last time, swiftly up and down. This close, he could see his opponent's chest heaving as fast as his own; they both knew this was going to have to look convincing, and as ruthless as all hell. Alan did not suppose there would be much difficulty over that. It was going to hurt him like the blazes when it came. The wound beneath his arm throbbed, a reminder that time was short, and he drew a long breath. Whichever way it turned out, what was about to be done was going to drive Edith half-wild with grief. But that could not be helped. He read the onset of the blow in the other man's face in the instant before he struck, and held steady, waiting. Staking life and everything he cared for on a threadbare ribbon of trust, and the honour of Sir Thomas Sharpe... such as might remain.

They were on the way back to Rushcot Hall. Lawrence shifted uneasily in the confined space. Her sister was glaring at her husband with narrowed eyes whilst he obviously felt uncomfortable under her intense gaze. He seemed unsure of where to look as his eyes were restlessly flicking backwards and forwards and his tanned fingers drummed on a trousered leg. \"Matilda, dear, why don't you rest?\" She called softly trying to ease the taught tension in the room. Their sapphire eyes locked and her gaze softened a little before she spoke. \"It's quite alright Amelia. I simply cannot wait until we are back home and safe. So much so that I wouldn't be able to even sleep a wink. What about you Lawrence?\" She turned to Amelia's husband with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. Lawrence cleared his throat after being caught off guard by his sister-in-laws sickly sweet tone. Hesitantly, he opened his mouth to speak but no sound made an effort to escape. He tensed as his thick eyebrows knitted at his nose. Amelia smirked at Matilda's teasing and announced with relief that the trio were home. The anticipation between the two sisters was high as the horse driver clicked the door open. The smartly dressed man held out a hand to Amelia. She took it and stepped into the frozen autumn sun and gave a sigh of relief as her black boots crunched on the gravel path. Matilda followed in much the same fashion, smoothing out her dark green dress with gloves hands. Lawrence was a different matter. His stiff limbs cracked upon standing up as he stumbled out of the carriage. He through up his hands as to cover his eyes as the sun was too bright after being in the gloomy carriage all day. Matilda and Amelia both rolled their eyes at him, impatient to go inside. \"Whenever you're ready, Lawrence\" said Amelia sarcastically as she tapped her foot on the ground. Lawrence gave her look of horror, shocked that she would use that tone with him but quickly covered it up when he saw Matilda smirk out of the corner of his eye. He cleared his throat again, a disgusting tendency of his in Amelia's opinion, and finally looked up to lay eyes on his new home. \"Goodness\" he said with surprise. He was a man of not very many words so he didn't say anything else. Instead he craned his neck up to keep looking at his new home. The beautiful dark wood stood out against the sky as small details stuck out and highlights of blue and gold caught his eye. The latticed windows stood out as each line and edge swirled on drawing you in deeper. The house was truly beautiful. The two sisters walked up the stone steps together towards the large double doors. As they approached the footmen heaved the doors open without the slightest squeak. The siblings walked into their home with their skirts swishing around their feet and Lawrence stumbling after them still in awe with his neck craned upwards. Once inside Amelia called for Mr Hopkinson, her melodious voice echoing off the polished walls. A tall man, certainly taller than 6ft, came down the intricate staircase beaming full of merriment. He was wearing a typical butlers garb with a sapphire satin waistcoat, a midnight blue dicky bow, a deep, black overcoat and gleaming, polished shoes. He hurried down the steps in a very unrefined manner before scooping both sisters in a smothering hug which the two affectionately returned. He pulled back with the joy evident on his young dark features as he breathlessly greeted his employers like his best friends. \"Amélie! Tilde! It's so good to see you both! I have been so lonely without you two.\" Matilda laughed at Hopkinson's animated features. \"We missed you too my dear Hopps, didn't we Amélie?\" \"Missed you more than anything, Hopps.\" Amelia added with a smile. Hopps looked at the two with obvious delight before his eyes settled on someone behind Amelia's shoulder. Lawrence. His posture stiffened as he went back to being formal in an instant. Seeing his distraction Matilda turned around and said \"Welcome to Rushcot Hall, Lawrence. I think you will like it very much.\" She turned around and briefly caught Amelia's eye and they both smirked.

As you all know from my notes there, pregnancy was scrambling my brain and writing became not just difficult but excruciating, so everything I had in the works took a massive backseat for awhile. Then in late September I was induced, had an extremely significant and terrifying complication mid-labor and was rushed back for an emergency C-section. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced but the good news is me and my little baby girl are okay, phew! It's been eight weeks and I'm finally feeling fully human again lol, and I am very very happy :D And now that me and baby (and my bigger kid) are on a nice little routine now, I found time to write something that has been plaguing my mind for I think about a year now. It was originally midnightwings96's idea that I added a few things to and was born of our mutual love for Crimson Peak. I truly love the movie and think it's terribly underrated, and I have many feelings about it but didn't think the story left much room for fanfiction. But that was where MW96 came in, and months and months later at 1 AM, I decided to write the thing lol. I wrote it partially to prove to myself that I can in fact still write and that my dry spell didn't ruin my brain lol, and to just get the writing juices flowing again. I can't guarantee that I'll get a new chapter of TDDUP out particularly soon, but I will try my best to get back to it ASAP and I do feel much better about my writing ability now lol. Now it's just an issue of finding the time, which I will do my best to do! In the meantime, hopefully some of you will enjoy this little thingy :) let me know what you all think, and hopefully I will see you guys soon back \"home\" in TDDUP! :D Ever since the early and sad, grief-tinged days of Edith's childhood, she had suspected that there was a great and largely ignored truth that laid beyond the \"after\" of death. And that was that death, frightening and unpredictable as it was, was not the hardest thing that one would ever face. Death was easy, inevitable, beyond the control of anyone that it chose to touch. Where most chose to fear death above all else due to those very reasons, Edith did not. Despite her youth, she knew one thing to be true above all else - living was the true challenge. Death would come when it pleased. Life, however, was determined by the choices one makes every single day that they drew breath. One wrong step could lead to catastrophe, and one would never know until it was too late. It could be anything - a missed appointment, a wrong turn on the street, an encounter with a dark stranger - even something as seemingly harmless as a dance . Yes, life was the true great unknown. Edith had watched too many lives depart, grieved too many souls, and now that she had experienced brand new life and the miracle of it... she was yet still dwelling in death's shadow, as if it were simply her place in the world and always had been. Maybe it was. She had thought it impossible, laughable even, when upon her return to New York and tedious recovery from her unthinkable ordeal, Alan had mentioned a possible explanation as to some of her less easily explained symptoms. It took time for them to surface, as so many of them were explained by the poison leftover in her frail system. But once it was clear and her strength returned, as much as it ever would, her still-present nausea and fatigue pointed to something else. Something wonderful and horrible and terrible and impossible . The gift of new, innocent life, growing within her and surviving against all odds. A miracle, the doctors said, and she couldn't disagree. She also wasn't sure that she could handle this latest turn that her life had taken. Having barely escaped Allerdale Hall with her life and sanity intact, now she would carry a piece of it - of him - with her forever, a constant reminder of the man who had fallen in love with her and paid for it with his life. She could hardly fathom him, could hardly comprehend her own complicated and convoluted feelings for someone who both cruelly victimized her and yet also loved her, so how could she even begin to process what it meant to carry his child in her womb? Alan, the kind and good soul that he was, offered to take her in and care for the child as his own. She could not accept such a generous thing, however, and stubbornly chose to live independently and raise the child without a husband. If it caused a scandal, and it surely would, she would be the very last one to care. After all that she had seen in her life, society talk was the very definition of frivolity and she no use for it. And Alan, well, she cared for him greatly and he would forever be the only one in the world to truly understand what she had endured overseas, but she could never love him the way that a wife should love a husband. And he ultimately accepted that, to her relief and his credit. And when the baby came, it nearly perished as unexpectedly as it had come. Labor pains came early, too early, and the midwife said that the child would not live. She told her to prepare herself and even advised her to not look at the baby after birth and certainly not hold it, as it would only make it harder to let him or her go. But, Edith reasoned, the baby had already survived so much so very miraculously - who was to say that it couldn't cheat death one more time? It was in the wee hours of the morning when William Carter Cushing was born, terribly small and blue and limp, seemingly validating everything the midwife had warned Edith of. But when Edith demanded her child to be placed in her arms, for better or worse, something happened that left the others in the room rather stunned. The baby, a boy with a head full of black hair and a will to live to match his mother's, stirred within the warmth of her arms and the familiar comfort of her heartbeat and voice, and he took his first breath without crying. In fact, as his skin shifted from deathly blue to an astonishingly healthy pink, he stayed entirely silent and opened his eyes to look up at his mother, who at that moment understood love on a level she previously never could have imagined. She smiled and laughed and kissed his little face while the midwife watched in disbelief, having never seen a baby born so early and in such distress survive somehow. Edith was still cautioned to continue preparing for the worst, however, because the child was by no standard healthy. Though breathing on his own just fine, his lungs were full of fluid and he quickly came down with a bad case of jaundice. He was also suspected to be blind in one eye and displayed poor reflexes with his limbs, but Edith didn't care if her baby grew up with poor vision, limited mobility, or any other hardship, so long as he was alive and happy. She knew how society looked down on such people, thinking them pitiful burdens on the able-bodied majority, but that was merely yet another reason for her to spurn society altogether. She took William - or Little Will, as she began to affectionately call him - home a week after his birth, and together they embarked on a journey that took Edith to a new phase of her strange but, as she began to believe it, blessed life. Her Little Will was a fighter, living and growing and refusing to allow the doctors to be right about him. He was tiny and frequently sick, delayed in nearly every milestone as well, but he was strong in ways that Edith could see from the start. He was not blind, as it turned out - his striking blue eyes worked perfectly well, and were a gift from his father - but he was deaf. At first Edith couldn't believe it, as it had always seemed that her voice lulled him to sleep so well, but it was because he could feel her voice rather than hear it. She was sad that he would never hear music, or the sound of a bird chirping, or the sound of his own laughter, but he would never know any different. She took what comfort she could in that and accepted him for who he was, just as she always had and vowed she always would. He was a beautiful child, his small size the only visible indication of his disabilities. Otherwise he was perfect, and to Edith's inner conflict, so very, very much like his father. She imagined Thomas himself looked just like him as a baby, adorable and bright-eyed and so very much full of potential that would never quite be realized. How the elder Sharpes could so abuse their own children was even more of a mystery now that Edith had her own little one, the idea of harm befalling him so egregious that it made her stomach turn. In her weaker, sleep-deprived moments in early motherhood, she would wonder how much different it could have all been had Lucille and Thomas suffered no abuse. Maybe Lucille's sanity never would have cracked so early in life, maybe Thomas would have been a better man, and maybe neither of them would have ever entertained the unhealthy desires that Edith had witnessed firsthand. Maybe they'd both still be alive and Thomas would still be her husband, and he would be raising Little Will alongside her. He would have loved the boy, Edith thought. He would have been proud of him and would have so much enjoyed watching him grow up. Little Will was a few months old when Edith began to suspect that maybe - just maybe - Thomas was watching him grow up after all. The first time it happened, it was very late at night and Will was fussing rather heartily. He was not hungry or in any other state that Edith could fix, but simply overtired and overstimulated and fighting sleep even though it was the only cure for what ailed him. Edith walked him about the room, rocking him gently in her arms and singing to him, kissing him, half-asleep herself and trying to salvage what was left of the night, but the baby was having none of it. With a sigh, she shifted him so that he was upright on her chest, cradling the back of his head with her hand as she continued to bounce him and try to soothe him, but nothing seemed to work. Then, just when she was about to cry from exhaustion and frustration, Little Will finally stopped crying. She furrowed her brows and blinked, wondering if he'd start crying again after taking a breather, but instead he laid his head on her shoulder and remained calm. She kissed the side of his head and suddenly felt... strange. It was a sort of strange that she had felt before, but not for a long time. She tilted her head back just far enough to see Little Will's face. His eyes were open and fixed quite firmly on something behind her, but as Edith was more than aware, there was nothing but an empty wall where he was staring. Bracing herself, she turned to look and see for herself what her son was so enamored with. There was nothing there, however, save for what looked like a single wisp of smoke dissolving so quickly before her eyes that she couldn't be sure if it had ever been there at all. She then looked at Little Will again. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and snuggled to her neck before falling into a blessedly deep sleep. The second time it happened, Little Will was older by a few months and playing in his crib as Edith retrieved a pair of glasses from her own room. When she returned, she wasn't yet to the door of the nursery when she heard her baby's happy little giggles. She smiled to herself and wondered what he found so funny, then found out as soon as she reached the doorway. Her smile froze on her face when she saw the unmistakable figure standing over the crib, not scaring the child at all but rather delighting him instead. Then she blinked and it - he - was gone. Little Will cried at his absence, and Edith later cried for entirely different reasons. She had expected him to stay there, at home, at Allerdale Hall. He was tied there, she had thought, by pain and fear and death and his own myriad of sins that he had never atoned for. But if he was here with her and their son , then perhaps it was because of something much more powerful than all those things combined. Love . At first, she was angry. She didn't want him there. She didn't want him near their son, whose disabilities were a result of the injuries she never would have suffered from had Thomas not targeted her and poisoned her and been every bit as guilty as Lucille in nearly killing her. He didn't deserve to be around them, to haunt them and not allow Edith to be free of him. He deserved to be stuck back at that horrid sinking house, doomed to an eternity with his deranged sister's own ghost, trapped within the walls of the place that had so warped them during their short lives. But as the days passed and encounters became more frequent, she found that she simply could not maintain that righteous anger. As much as she should hate him, as anyone else in her shoes would, she couldn't . He deserved her anger and her hate, she knew, but she didn't have the energy or the spite to keep those things alive. Not when she truly did believe with every fiber of her being that despite his flaws and his unthinkable, terrible actions, he truly had loved her and was trying to save her life when Lucille had killed him herself. And he had saved her, distracting his sister long enough for Edith to kill her in self defense. And he seemed ashamed, she began to realize as the months went on. He avoided her, never appearing in her line of sight and rarely in a room that she occupied, usually always instead appearing whenever Little Will was alone in his room. She would hear the telltale giggles and know that he was there, but the minute she approached the room, he would disappear - but never before turning her way with what was unmistakably regret and shame in his chilling eyes. It brought Edith no pleasure to see what was left of Thomas in such pain. She wished he could be free rather than tied there, being punished in what was perhaps a sort of purgatory right in her own home. She could only imagine how unspeakably it would hurt to watch your child grow up sickly and disabled and sometimes in great pain, knowing that your actions were what caused it. And since Edith knew that Thomas had already lost one child - also due to his own terrible actions, himself and Lucille damning the child to a short and painful existence by creating it in the first place - it seemed an even crueler fate. But Little Will knew none of this and seemed to adore the ghost that kept him company. He grew into a spirited and challenging little toddler, still terribly small and frequently ill and easily tired, preferring to crawl or drag his legs around than walk due to what doctors believed was a spinal abnormality, but he was full of life and curiosity. He loved art and would paint grand pictures with his hands on the walls of his room, something Edith allowed because he loved it so much and she loved seeing him happy. He also loved animals and, oddly enough, thunderstorms. Where most children would be afraid of thunder and lightning, he seemed to love it and would look excitedly out the window every time a new storm arrived, giggling at each new lightning bolt that struck the earth. He was eccentric and sweet and the very center of Edith's universe. He was also Thomas' spitting image, something that never failed to make her heart ache when it would hit her how truly beautiful they both were. She let Little Will have his father's ghost as a playmate, never discouraging him from interacting with him and also never telling him who he was. They communicated with signs made with their hands, and when Little Will gestured to where Thomas had stood only moments earlier before vanishing at Edith's arrival, he had said friend . Edith simply smiled and nodded, wondering if one day she would explain it to him or if he would figure it out for himself. Meanwhile, as her baby grew up, Edith spent her free time writing a book that she didn't think many people would really want to read. But she had no choice; the words were all but tearing out of her, and the only relief she could get was to get them down on paper and out of her head. It was painful and cathartic and terrible all at once, but she never second-guessed herself. To anyone else, the book would be a work of fairly fanciful fiction, tugging at the heartstrings and scaring the wits out of the reader along the way as well. But for her, it was simply the life that she had lived until that point. Sometimes, when Little Will was down for the night and she was locked away in her room, furiously writing the late hours away, she would feel another presence near her and know that she wasn't alone. She never looked behind her because she knew that he would just vanish, so she kept her eyes on the paper instead. Sometimes she would just keep writing, letting him watch - maybe he read over her shoulder, since he always did enjoy reading her work - and sometimes she would talk to him. She would tell him about any and everything from an annoying and too-long trip to the market, to what the doctors were saying about Little Will these days and if she believed it or not. She would talk about her hopes and dreams for him and her fears and worries too, and though there was never a verbal reply, she always felt a little less alone in those moments. Somebody loved her son as much as she did, and yes , someone loved her , too, though she preferred not to think about that. She kept Thomas' presence to herself, though Alan noticed Little Will's strange attentions during his periodic visits to their home. If he suspected what was afoot, he never said a word, and Edith appreciated that. It was one of the reasons why their friendship was one she valued so much, because he respected her deeply and didn't seem to have an intrusive bone in his body. Others never noticed a thing. Despite it all, Edith was happy and so was Little Will. Though she received looks of pity and sometimes revulsion on the street, she couldn't have been more proud of her son and being a mother was by far the most rewarding experience of her life. It was hardly easy, but no thing worth having was ever easy. She was content to raise her son at home and spend her free time writing, and when he was nearly five years old, she began writing the final chapter of her novel. One night, as she neared the conclusion of the story at last, she heard Little Will giggling in his room and sighed to herself, taking off her glasses and stretching before heading to his room to check on him. He was supposed to be sleeping, but it wasn't unusual for him to climb out of bed and start playing until entirely too late of an hour. She didn't brace herself anymore, because she was more than used to the sight that she would surely stumble upon. But she probably should have, because what she found brought tears to her eyes. Little Will had a train set that was broken and had been for some time. The tracks were warped and some of the wheels had fallen off, and really it was little more than trash but anytime she tried to throw it out, he would have none of it. He still played with the broken pieces from time to time, but tonight, he wasn't playing with the train set - he was sitting on the floor and fixing it, and his \"friend\" was silently helping guiding him in his task. She closed her eyes and turned away from the door, trying not to think of that freezing attic and all the little toys and contraptions within it that Thomas had made as a little boy. She tried not to think about all that wasted talent and natural ability, and she certainly tried not to think about the sheer sadness of him imparting some of that knowledge to his only son despite the insurmountable barriers between them. She decided to leave them be, quietly returning to her room and to her book. She was so close to finishing that she could nearly taste it, and with a lump in her throat and the occasional tear escaping her eye, she settled back down in front of her typewriter and wrote the final words to her story. She wasn't sure when he had come to her room or how much time had passed, but she knew when he arrived all the same. She always did, and when it was finished - her longest and most painfully beautiful work, finished at last, she took a cleansing and tired breath and took her glasses off again, leaning back in her seat and closing her eyes for a moment. There was something that she needed to tell him, though she wasn't sure if she could. The words were there but they felt like lead on her tongue, and she might have been crazy for needing to say them in the first place. She didn't particularly care, however, because her life thus far had hardly been a typical one and thus neither were her feelings or convictions. She opened her eyes and, knowing that he was listening behind her, took one more deep breath before finally finding the will to tell him what she so very much needed to. \"I forgive you.\" Once the words were out, that heavy feeling within vanished. She felt lighter, freer, and the sense of relief within the room was palpable. She didn't think that she was the only one who could feel it. Then she stood up from her seat and turned around, and this time, the ghost of her husband didn't leave. He stayed, and while she wasn't sure if she would ever truly be used to his gruesome yet beautiful visage, she didn't flinch or shrink away in the slightest. His snow-white hair and yellow, unsettling eyes stood in contrast against the ever-present knife wound weeping wisps of blood on his cheek, so very different in death than how she remembered him in life. After the shortest moment spent taking him in, not a single ounce of fear surfacing in her mind or heart, she looked him in his eerily beautiful eyes as she explained in a shaky but strong voice, \"I'm not excusing you, because there's no excuse for what you did to me or the others. But I can't hate you. I've tried and I can't. And I don't want to. You've paid the price for everything you did. I don't want you to suffer anymore. So... I forgive you.\" The emotion on his pale, scarred face made her eyes well up with tears all over again. She knew then that despite her forgiveness, nothing would bring his suffering to an end, not really, but... she had alleviated some of it and lifted one burden from his shoulders, and that was all that she could hope for. Like the first time she had encountered his ghost, she reached out to touch his face one more time, cradling his cheek and wishing for just one moment that he was real and she could feel him again rather than just a cool rush of air. And just like that first time, he closed his eyes and leaned into her touch, as if he was desperate for the comfort of it and just as willing as she was to pretend for a moment that everything was okay and there was only the two of them, as they should have been but would never be. And when she pulled her hand away, his eyes opened to meet hers one more time before he vanished into the shadows. She knew that he wasn't gone for good and that he would be back, that he was tied to her and to their son, and for the first time since she had first suspected his presence in her home, she was at peace with that fact. Her conflicted feelings and guilt over her lack of anger were no longer holding her back from forgiveness, and as a result, she was finally free. She couldn't change the past but she could change her future and make peace with that terrible past. Her mother, her father, her husband and every other departed soul that she had known were gone but would always be with her in ways that few others would ever believe, but that didn't matter. She had her precious little son, her passion for writing, and the strength to forgive and leave her fear and anger in the past where it belonged, in order to make room for love and happiness in the future. Life and living was never easy, no, and love was even harder. But it was worth the struggle and pain, she knew beyond a single doubt, and her place was not in death's shadow. She was in nobody and nothing's shadow, free to live and prosper and maybe find love again someday, but she would not have been the woman and mother that she was had she not been touched by death so many times. And she would not have the greatest love that she had ever known, the love of a little child who had changed her life forever and taught her things that she had never known before. All was not as it should have been, but nothing in an imperfect world ever was. That was the dark and frightening beauty of it, she supposed, and nothing would ever change that. But wherever there was shadows there was light as well, and she was happy to dwell within the space between both. Perhaps she had found her true place at last.

When I think on Thomas and our brief time together it seems now like a memory of a dream and yet, a dream so real that it impressed itself upon soul and memory with enough fire and emotion to last a lifetime. It is as if those few short months of days and hours and moments seared themselves into my very being, like the images on the photographic glass Alan once explained to me. After Thomas' death, I spent many months relieving that time, trying to understand...anything. Alan was my mainstay, my sanity, then. Always making sure I got out of bed, ate, left the house instead of becoming the determined shut-in I tried to be. The problem however wasn't that I *couldn't* forget, which he was always trying to get me to do. \"Just forget it, Edith, you are free of it, of them.\" If he said it once, he said it a thousand times. No...it wasn't that I couldn't forget... It was that I so,so desperately didn't wish to. At first, everything seemed so surreal. The people rushing to help us, the questions. What happened? Whats going on? Where is Master Sharpe? And his sister? Why are they so bloody? Everything passed over and through me, like the sharp-edged snow laden winds. I focused myself solely and fixedly upon helping Alan until even that was taken from me by patting, soothing, helping hands. The hands draped blankets over our shoulders and helped us into carts and handed us warm things to drink and stopped the ceaseless flow of blood from our bodies. Then they herded me into a bed and I knew no more for I know not how long. But eventually I woke, suddenly, and reached out my hand, Thomas' name upon my lips...and remembered. Once, when I was much younger, I was a bit of a tomboy. My father indulged me in this, as he did in so many things, and allowed me to play with Alan and various others boys who were not unwilling to have a girl tagging along. I think, now, that forbearance was due mostly to my father's influence upon those young fellows father's but then, I was just glad to be tolerated. Even so, it was during a game of toss that one of the boys, a slightly older and much bigger (than I, at least ) boy decided to toss me the ball. Perhaps it was accident, perhaps not but, he threw it quite a bit harder than had been the practice and the ball slipped straight thru my young hands and hit me solidly in the chest. I was sure I had been struck a fatal blow. Of course, the boys, knowing I would survive being winded, continued the game, slightly further from my pitiful presence. Except for Alan who, as my gallant protector slash brother figure, made sure I was alive and then dashed away to retrieve my nurse. For my part, my chest ached, I could draw no breath and felt as if my stomach had collapsed inward. I dropped to the ground curled around the misery in my middle and prayed my end would come quick. It was my first true injury and a pain that I never forgot. I felt that same pain when my father told me my mother had died. I felt it when I gazed upon my father's lifeless body. I felt it again now. I slowly drew my hand back again to myself and laid my head down upon the pillow, staring vacantly at the place where my husband's head should have lain. I could not describe then nor, with the passing of time and hindsight, now, what it was I felt at that moment . So many times in the past few weeks had I awakened as now and put out a searching hand to find him only to be left wanting...as now. It had not always been so. At the beginning, everything had seemed so surreal. My engagement, my father's death...everything. As horrid as I had felt about it at the time, I was so relieved when Lucille took ship for home. To prepare my homecoming, as she said. I thought it selfish but I had greatly wanted, and needed, the entirety of Thomas' attention then and with her there, I never felt as if I truly had it. Perhaps that should have been a clue. Then I knew only that it was as if a great dark cloud had lifted and, while everything was still dark and solemn about me, there was some hope for light soon because I had Thomas. During this time, he was my rock and I leaned upon him unreservedly. I opened myself to him unabashedly. I cried and raged and wept and raged some more and he was always there, listening and holding me and offering handkerchiefs and drinks and food and sympathy and whatever else I required. He was so very good at being exactly what I needed when I needed it. I don't know if this was studied behavior for him or a natural tendency. I think, knowing what I know now, that it may have been a bit of both as he was entirely too at ease with it to be merely an affectation. The entirety of his life now, to me, seems to have been spent in being what someone else needed. It saddens me. My poor Thomas. I hope that maybe, just perhaps, even if it was near the end, I was just what he needed also. It would have been unthinkable to marry immediately after my father's death so we waited two months. At the time it seemed an eternity. I craved so desperately for some normality to my life instead of the endless round of mourning visitors, a custom I would gladly have shirked, and meetings with father's business partners. Of course it was not expected that I, a woman and a young one at that, should do more than listen to their suggestions and sign where they pointed. It was here that Thomas was actually quite helpful, reviewing with me the suggestions made and explaining, with endless patience, why this needed to be done or that contract signed or not signed. It actually earned him some measure of respect amongst father's cronies as he proved he had some business acumen beyond inventing. Even Alan consented to a begrudging sort of approval for Thomas' efforts on my behalf. Indeed, at times it seemed he was a completely different man than the one I had first met. I was quite proud of him. All in all, I was unspeakably grateful that father's death allowed us to marry quite quietly and humbly. I had always dreaded the thought of a grand and ostentatious wedding, all the while knowing that my father's wealth and social standing would ensure me nothing else. With the strictures of mourning however, such a display would have been unthinkable. And, while I cried from the guilt of it, I could not escape the gratefulness I felt for being allowed to pass that particular social ritual of the wealthy by. Therefore, we were married quietly and soberly by the same minister who had baptized me and buried my parents and witnessed only by my maid, Alan and my father's good friend and lawyer, Mr. Ferguson. As the days grew closer toward the time of our departure and marriage, I noticed a subtle but marked change come over the man I was to marry. We were wed the morning of the day we were to take ship for England as we couldn't travel together unwed. As I took his hand to pledge my troth to him forevermore, I looked up into his face and was struck hard by the change that had come over him. For the past few weeks he had been kind and witty, charming and affectionate. And always solicitous of my wellbeing. Truly, the kind of man most women dream of for a husband. And yet now, the stark pallor of his countenance, the oh so slight tremble of his hand and the somber, sad darkness of his usually bright eyes was enough to cause me to pause and stumble upon my vows. He gave me a curious look and then squeezed my hand and offered me a tentative smile. I smiled tremulously in return and squeezed back, gathered my courage and finished my vows with a ringing clarity that echoed back to me from the vaulted ceiling of the small chapel. Despite my deep sadness over my father, I could not help some excitement at this new course my life was now set upon. I had never been aboard a ship before, the height of my experience upon the water being leisurely rowed around the small lake in the park near my home by Alan. I would be lying ere I said the idea of sailing out across the open sea did not by turns excite and terrify me. As we approached the (intimidatingly large) vessel, I spared several seconds for intense prayer that I should not be one prone to sea sickness. Somewhat of my trepidation must have translated itself by my resolute grip upon Thomas' arm, for he patted my hand and turning to smile down at me, assured me there was naught to fear. I smiled back, wanly, I'm sure, but he did not call me upon it, simply held me steady as we mounted the gangplank. I wonder, if I had known then what was shortly to be in store for me, would I have stepped my boot upon the swaying surface? Or would I have hiked my skirts and run apace after the carriage that had just disgorged us? I try not to think upon it to much. I will never know what possessed me to speak deceptively to Lucille when she questioned me upon the intimacies of my marriage bed. Perhaps it was the wrongness of her that reached out to me even in my ignorant state, warning me of divulging too much information to this strange and strangely intimidating woman. At other times I think it was just shock that, being an unmarried woman herself, she should have such knowledge and feel free to question me about my own. After all, I had been quite ignorant of carnal knowledge myself until a particular night aboard ship... I had implored Thomas to let us take our evening meal in the privacy of our sitting room as I simply did not feel up to dressing for dinner in the more formal dining room. He gave me an assessing look and I endeavored to look as pitiful and worn as possible. There had been a bit of rough seas earlier as we had passed thru a small squall and, while it was true that I had experienced a bit of discomfort the first couple days we had been at sea, I was now as hale as any sailor upon the deck. He acquiesced however and left to procure our meal. As soon as the door shut behind him I shot off the sofa to set my plan into action. I knew precious little of the ways between men and women personally, but my maid had been a potential well-spring of information that I had pumped with ruthless tenacity. Being a solid married woman herself I had assumed she would be most willing to share whatever information I needed upon the mysteries of marriage but I had been disappointed to find her quite reticent when it came to speaking about it. The most I had been able to pry forth from her was that it was a wife's duty to please her husband, in whatever way he required and to not be afeared if my husband asked me to disrobe. At this point she grew rather flustered and her Irish accent, normally quite nonexistent, made a rather marked appearance and I was only able to understand that I should allow him to touch me wherever he wished and not complain about anything he did. This did little to satisfy either my curiosity or my nerves. So I racked my father's library, his study and his bedroom, looking for...something. Surely there was a guide for marriage. I am a firm believer in the guidance to be had from the written word. And I was not completely ignorant. I spent much time in the stables and was well aware of how progeny, at least of the equine sort, came into being. Therefore, it only stood to reason that something of the same pattern must hold true for other species as well. Including the human one. But how such would work was the question. And surely I was not the only person ignorant on this topic. Therefore, their must exist a manual of sorts. I found nothing. Therefore, taking my courage (and some money) in hand, I bade my maid to find me a book on marriage that would be helpful. What she brought me was far from it. After locking myself in my room and opening its hallowed informational pages, I made it roughly halfway thru before chucking it into the flames of my fireplace. It was full of imagery about bees and flowers and...well. I am neither a bee nor a flower and neither, thank God, is Thomas. I hung my head over the edge of my bed, screwed shut my eyes and pondered my options. There were precious few. At the point of quite giving up, I was unexpectedly saved by the utterly unforeseen auspices of Alan's mother, Mrs. McMicheal herself. She had come by quite unexpectedly one afternoon and, as we took tea, removed a small book from her handbag and passed it hastily to me. Amidst several starts, stops and stammers, she managed to convey that she, as a friend to my mother, wished to give me the information that my mother would surely have provided had she still been with us, God rest her soul. She then, quite astonishingly, gulped down what was left of her tea and beat a hasty retreat. I was left with a hanging mouth, witless look, cup of cooling tea and a small book in my hand. I hastily hid it under my skirts as Thomas chose that moment to breeze into the parlor and inquire about the lady's visit. I managed to say something coherent and shooed him off to wherever and after he left exhumed the small volume from the midst of my skirts and, after hastily shutting the parlor door, retreated to my favorite chair to examine its contents. *This* book was most informative. Now, aboard ship and with my husband out for the moment, I set about setting the scene for seduction. To say Thomas was receptive to my overtures would have been the grossest of understatement. After his initial shocked surprise when realizing my intent and desire, he was a ready participant...and a most willing and patient teacher. I had determined in my mind to not be hesitant or show shame for anything that might happen for, while the manual had been most explicit in describing the actions between man and woman, it was also, quite...clinical. As I had tried to envision these here-fore described activities occurring between myself and Thomas, I was beset with both embarrassment and want in equal measure. I was surprised to find how much I actually *desired* to experience these activities with him and wondered if it would be the same for him. My natural reticence warred with my budding realization that this was what should occur between man and wife and was therefore not carnal sin but perfectly allowed. I there determined to strangle my maidenly shyness into submission of my greater desire, which was to love, and be loved, by my husband. Thomas approached me like a supplicant, hesitant and tender, as if afraid of either my breakableness or my shyness. When I discovered to him that neither of these were of consideration for me, he then made love to me with a desperate sort of hunger, as if he had longed for such as this for an eternity and would never be allowed such an experience again. He begged for me to touch him, hold him, *love* him with a humble intensity that brought tears to my eyes and returned my ardor to me sevenfold. When our passion was spent, he curled himself around me and there we slept the sleep of the fulfilled and blissful, twined as vines about each other. There followed days of blissful happiness as I discovered the joys to be found in my husbands arms...and in his bed. As the time of our arrival to England grew near, again I noticed my husband, earlier so warm and willing to please, seem to draw in upon himself. The quality of his attention to me the night before our arrival the next day had all the seeming hallmarks of a farewell. Even stranger to me as he had seemed to avoid me all that day. I had expected, with his oddly reticent behavior, that he might avail himself of the stateroom he had all but abandoned after the night we formed our more affectionate understanding. I had therefore been truly surprised at his appearing in my stateroom that evening and had said as much. He apologized with a sad, quirkish sort of smile and of course I, in my youthful and ignorant blindness, thought little more of it and was most content to slip beneath the bedsheets beside him. He seemed content simply to hold me, as close as could be managed, and thusly I fell asleep...only to be wakened in the wee hours by his ardent, and rather desperate, caresses. With the gift now of hindsight to look back upon with, I wonder if it was perhaps his way of apologizing for the distance and separation that was to come. For all I loved him, I cannot love that he would so full willingly have deceived me. I see now, as I could not then, how life and circumstance had shaped him into the sadly warped man he was. Do I hold his sin against him then? Does the log in the fireplace hold aught against the fire that burned it? Can I find fault with him for the untenable circumstances with which he grew to manhood? Circumstances that shaped him into the man he was? Can I fault his sister? That strange, sad, depraved woman who preyed upon the only other person in her life to supply all her needs? For all she was undeniably insane, do I fault her entirely? If so, then I must not excuse Thomas upon circumstance for, was she not given unto the same circumstances? With whom and wherein lay the fault that turned them so depravedly to one another in unnatural concourse? Was she responsible as the older sibling? Was Thomas simply weak? Was it a sickness of mind or bloodline? Or does the fault lie with their parents? I can only imagine, from the little I gleaned from those few times they were ever mentioned that the parents they had known had differed so mightily from my own that words cannot even be found to express it. I could conjecture from here til eternity, I think I could verily drive myself as mad as Lucille in the end if I pondered upon it too long and so I try and satisfy myself with only this: Whatever happened, whosoever faults it may have been, in the end, I loved him and Thomas loved me, enough to break from his bonds and seek to save not only me but Alan as well. Enough to stand against the only other love he had known.. Enough to cross the boundaries of death. ","Summary":" I just can never resist...

No need to pretend. This is who I am. This is who he is. Edith M. Cushing published her debut novel Crimson Peak in 1902. The photograph on the original cover depicted a young woman, bespectacled, a deep scar on her cheek, her face stiff and serious the way most old photographs are. The novel, while beautifully written, wasn't well received by her peers who were not used to the honesty and the gruesomeness Ms Cushing depicted. Ms Cushing wrote 15 novels until she died, all of which were centred around ghosts, loss and love. And while she maintained a close and loving relationship with her childhood friend, Dr Alan McMicheal, Edith M. cushing never remarried. One day, when Edith is old and frail and feels as weak as she did when she was 23 and poisoned, she gets up from her chair and leaves the ache behind. Her cheek bleeds again, her feet are cold and damp and the collar around her neck restricts her breathing. Allerdale Hall emerges in front of her, heaving and breathing and sinking into the blood red clay. Her ankle hurts, twists under her weight and Edith can feel the ragged cold eating into her skin, can hear the soft humming of Lucille's singing, of her piano play, polished and perfect after decades of unresting, unwielding patience. Edith pulls the door open, with shivering, trembling hands and, after sixty years of writing, dreaming of this place and it creaking ache, she wanders its halls again until her fingers rest on the piano. Lucille, with her hair drawn up tight, her dress laced up, corset snug, too tight, around her waist, plays her lullaby, her blood stained hands steady and secure, Thomas' head on her shoulder. He is still as she remembers him, bleeding onto the snowy white of his skin, his clothes, his hair, eyes sunken in. His chest rises and falls slowly. Lucille is wearing black, bowy, frilly black, fabric tied together, holding her in. Edith remembers a wide, flowing night gown and open, spilling hair, the ring a spec of red in all this sea of dark and white, can feel her own hair flowing over her back, over her shoulders. \"You play marvellously\", she says, runs her hand over the rotting wood of the piano. Thomas opens his eyes, lifts his head. \"Edith\", he says, as if her name was the first breath of air he's taken in decades, as if his entire being was tied to it. Lucille doesn't stop playing, the ring prominent and bright on her finger. Thomas gets up, takes a step towards Edith. He says her name again and Edith smiles. \"Thomas\", she says, and caresses his oozing, bleeding cheek. Lucille hits the wrong key. \"I see you have not grown any smarter\", she says, her voice deep and rough. Edith thinks of the poison that never left her completely and cooks her head. \"Maybe not.\" She opens her collar, draws a deep breath. \"But I have lived. Longer than either of you meant for me to.\" \"I congratulate on the success of your books, Edith\", Lucille says, rising from her chair, and puts two fingers under Edith's chin. Blood drips from the wound on her head into her eyes and she hums. \"I wonder if they would sell quite as well if you had written about the whole, the awful truth of it all.\" Edith smiles and grasps Lucille's wrist. \"I am no biograph, Lady Sharpe. I write fiction. As inspired by reality as it may be, it is still fiction.\" Thomas laughs, a quiet, soft sound echoing through the rotting walls. \"I have to say, Your Ladyship.\" He kisses her cheek. \"You have not lost your spirit.\" Lucille presses her lips together. Edith draws small circles on her skin and Lucille pulls her hand away as if she had been burned. \"I am not one of your characters who is seduced by a little kindness, Miss Cushing\", she says and grabs the house keys hanging from her dress. Edith's hand is blood stained, or maybe it is the clay. She can't be sure. \"I am aware of that\", she says softly. \"But you told me yourself that the only love either of you ever knew was from one another. Perhaps it is time to change that.\" \"We are dead\", Thomas says and Edith nods. \"Yes.\" She crouches down in front of Lucille. \"But that does not mean that there are no feelings. Ghosts like you, ghosts so beautiful even after years of decay, they are bound by emotions. Some by anger, by fear, resentment even.\" She reaches for Lucille's hand. \"Others, by loss, or desperation, or love.\" Lucille draws in a deep breath. The house around them groans. \"Tell me\", Edith looks at Thomas, doesn't let go of Lucille. Her skin feels soft and calloused, the metal of the ring cool and soothing against Edith's hand. \"Which is it, for you?\" Thomas sits down on the floor next to her. His blood drips on the rotting wood and he looks at her. \"Why would you be here?\", he asks. \"We almost killed you. Lucille tried, until the end.\" Edith hums. \"I am a writer who, at 23 years old, married a man she knew was too good to be true and stabbed his sister with a pen when I knew she had killed four people before me and was bedding her brother. What does that say about me?\" Lucille laughs, a chilling sound, and kisses Edith's hand. \"That you are a very brave, very stupid young girl. And that you have little sense of self preservation.\" Edith smiles and bows her head. \"Yes, perhaps. But it also means that despite all your efforts, I am alive, and I am here, and I love Thomas.\" She straightens a fold in Lucille's skirt. \"And the two of you will always be two. You will never be without one another. I can see that, too.\" \"What are you saying?\" Thomas' hand is cold and soft and bloody on her waist and Edith raises her head to look at Lucille towering above her. \"How could I not love what you love, too? How could I live in this house and breathe with it and listen to its stories and not be entranced with Lucille?\" \"We poisoned you\", Lucille says. \"We lied to you. We've killed three innocent women.\" Edith nods. \"Yes\", she says. \"You did.\" She kisses Lucille's knuckles. \"This house, it transforms you, drains the colour out of you. But you forget one thing.\" \"And what is that?\" \"There are moths, more colourful than any butterfly. They feed on the cold and the dark, and they are not so easily maimed.\" Some say, Ms Cushing was an odd woman, ever smiling, ever writing. She didn't mind blood and darkness, wrote of them with love and tenderness. She wore her scars with pride and told her stories with certainty, with loving care, as if each of the ghosts was her child.

He and his sister had spent almost the last of their money to make the long trip to Buffalo. What they would do next if their fund-raising efforts here failed, he could not imagine. After fifteen years of trying to get his machine funded and built to restore their family business, Thomas was on edge before this meeting. But also tired: tired of rejection, tired from everything it had taken to get even this far. Tired, especially, of the role he'd have to perform again if his presentation to Cushing did not succeed. Lucille saw today's meeting only as a prologue to their real play. This time, though, Thomas wanted to earn the money as a businessman should, by convincing investors of his machine's value. When he entered the Cushing and Company offices, he paused in the doorway, and what he saw lifted his spirits. The large, open room hummed with activity. Men worked together on the drawings or models that sat on every surface. These were men like him, who dreamed of the future and wanted to build it. Thomas surreptitiously inspected his coat and quickly tucked away some loose threads at the worn cuffs. He must look his current part – that of a promising inventor in whom others could confidently invest – because to men such as Cushing, even small details could matter. Thus prepared, Thomas saw his first audience: two secretaries working at a desk in the center of the room. He began his performance by putting on his 'confident yet modest' expression, then walked briskly towards them. One woman seemed the sort of clerical person he expected: older, conservatively dressed, unremarkable. The other, a typist bent over her machine, appeared rather young, her outfit smarter and more feminine. As he neared them, he chose to address the younger woman, saying \"Good morning, Miss.\" She looked up from her work and smiled. When he saw her face, his heartbeat quickened, and that was not just from his usual nerves before a meeting. She struck him as exceptionally alive. Her smiling mouth was slightly open, as if she'd been caught by surprise. Even behind the glasses she wore, her gaze seemed to take in everything about him eagerly – but with a thoughtful curiosity, not the simpering admiration he usually received from secretaries. And, too, she was quite pretty, with a pale but warm complexion beneath her abundant golden hair. When he noticed all this, his stomach suddenly dropped. Once, when he was a small boy, Thomas had fallen down a flight of stairs at Allerdale Hall. The vivid sensations had never left him. First, he'd felt the jolt of fear in the pit of his stomach. Then he'd begun to experience his fall as slowly if he were struggling to move through wet clay. As he'd tumbled, he'd observed every detail of the stairs, though the fall had taken only a few seconds. Now time slowed again for him and he found himself noticing the smallest things about the girl – her curving upper lip, the beauty mark above her mouth…. But, he reminded himself sternly, he should not be paying her any attention at all. He tried to right himself by performing the usual staging: he put down the carrying case with a little extra emphasis. Doffed the top hat with a subtle flourish. And finished by removing his gloves a trifle slowly, to call attention to his elegant hands. As he'd hoped, this audience watched him expectantly. Thomas did look at the older woman long enough to say politely, \"Forgive the interruption.\" But he felt compelled to turn back to the typist (her glowing face…). He informed her – in his best aristocratic drawl – that \"I have an appointment with Mr. Carter… Everett… Cushing.\" The golden-haired girl replied cheerfully, \"Goodness!\" She turned (the elegance of her neck…) to the other woman, adding in the same tone, \"With the great man himself!\" At that rather pert remark, the two women shared a smile for some reason. Thomas, disconcerted, wondered if the typist was making fun of him for the way he'd announced his business. But something inside him said, she would not do that, so he did not react haughtily or in anger as he might otherwise have done. Instead, he forced a small smile and replied mildly, \"I'm afraid so,\" producing his card as she turned back to him. She took it and read aloud: \"Sir Thomas Sharpe - \" (her gentle voice, saying his name!) \" - Baronet.\" She looked up at him as if startled, then abruptly dropped her gaze and the smile faded from her face. The other woman, however, took the card and said politely, \"He'll be here shortly.\" He glanced at her, saying \"Thank you,\" as she moved away. When he looked back to the typist, perplexed by her sudden change in attitude, she was regarding him coolly. She had started to gather up the manuscript from which she'd been working. \"You're not late, are you?\" she asked, with a slight edge to her voice (the flash of her amber eyes!). She stood (her slender waist…) as she added, \"He hates that.\" She straightened her collected papers (such delicate hands!), tapping the edge of the pile on the desktop. The sound drew Thomas's eyes down to the typescript still there – \"Chapter One,\" it began – but he looked up as she began to walk away (the graceful sway of her skirt…). He hastily said, trying to keep her attention, \"Not at all,\" but she did not stop. He looked at the typescript again, hoping to find something to remark on that would bring her back. While he skimmed the top page, he stalled by adding, \"In fact, I'm a little early.\" She replied, over her shoulder, \"Oh, I'm afraid he hates that too,\" as Thomas read: 'A house as old as this Hall becomes, in time, a living thing. It starts holding on to things – ' Even more intrigued, he said to her retreating figure, \"I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry, but….\" It was enough; at last, the typist turned back to him. Encouraged, he picked up the pages and took a few steps towards her as he asked, \"... this is a piece of fiction, is it not?\" The girl answered simply, \"Yes.\" At least her tone now allowed him to continue, so he enquired, \"Who are you transcribing this for?\" While she answered, \"It's to be sent to New York tomorrow, to the Atlantic Monthly,\" he glanced at the page again. He started to reply, \"Well, whoever wrote it, it's, em…,\" but the language pulled him back in: ' – keeping them alive when they shouldn't be. Some of them good; some are bad… and some should never be spoken of again.' 'This much I know: there are things that tie ghosts to a place (very much like they do us). Some remain tethered to a patch of land, a time and date, the spilling of blood, a terrible crime.' He remembered to finish his remark to the girl: \"... it's rather good, don't you think?\" As he kept reading, he felt her move nearer as she asked, \"Really?\" She sounded uncertain. He replied, his eyes still on the page, \"Well, it's certainly captured my attention,\" while he took in: 'There are other ghosts; others that hold on to an emotion, a drive – loss, revenge, or love. These, they never go away.' Then the girl said softly, \"I wrote it.\" It took a moment for her words to register with Thomas. As he looked at her doubtfully – how could such a young person, and only a secretary, write so compellingly? – she stated firmly, \"It's mine.\" Her face showed determination and a shy pride. He instantly recognized her feelings; the first time someone had complimented him on his machine's design, it had meant a great deal to him. Now that they had this in common, he was even more drawn to her. But – he could not help a dark thought – did she write because it was fashionable for the society ladies she doubtless emulated to try their hands at fiction? Or was she driven to create? Could she withstand having her work questioned? To survive, he knew from bitter experience, true inventors must be prepared to stand up for their ideas whenever challenged. His mind raced as he put the pages of her story back in order. To test her determination, he said, assuming a slight smile but putting some doubt in his voice, \"Ghosts.\" She quickly started to explain, saying \"The ghosts are just a metaphor, really, for the – .\" He just as quickly interrupted, eager to reassure her, with \"Ghosts have always fascinated me,\" for she had passed his test. But in a rare moment of self-awareness, Thomas also acknowledged to himself that he had just started to, em, flirt. And why shouldn't he? For everything he'd done in the service of his family, he thought he had earned this small moment. Why should he not, just this once, talk to a young, truly pretty girl who wanted nothing from him but his opinion? And it was harmless, really, for he likely would never see her again after today – even though he admitted to himself that he wanted to do so. So Thomas took advantage of the moment to move very close to her while he explained, \"You see, where I come from… ghosts are not to be taken lightly.\" At his explanation, she smiled a little. He could not keep from smiling back at her – genuinely, this time – making them conspirators against the doubters of the world. A commanding masculine voice calling \"Sir Thomas Sharpe!\" interrupted their moment of rapport. The typist quickly turned towards the speaker, so this could only be 'the great man himself,' Mr. Cushing. Thomas hurried back to the desk and put down the typescript as Cushing approached and continued, \"Welcome to our fair city!\" Saying \"Sir. It's my pleasure,\" Thomas shook Cushing's proffered hand. To Thomas's surprise, the businessman then turned to the typist, who for some reason had not withdrawn from the scene. Touching the girl's arm lightly, Cushing remarked, \"I see you've already met my daughter, Edith….\" Shocked, Thomas shot a glance at the \"typist;\" she demurely averted her gaze. He briefly looked askance at his host, but saw that the man was not joking. Thomas looked back at the girl – no, Miss Cushing – ruefully, sorry for his assumptions about her. She raised her eyes and met his look with a small but mischievous smile. As they walked to the meeting, Thomas struggled to keep up his end of a conversation with Cushing, fighting the urge to turn back and watch the daughter. While she'd seemed like an unconventional secretary, Miss Cushing apparently was an even more unconventional young lady. Deliberately letting him think that she was a typist – he'd never met anyone like her! Now he wanted only to see and talk to her again. But that was not the script he must follow. Once in front of the investors, Thomas concentrated, threw himself back into his role, and launched into his presentation. He had just switched on his miniature machine when Miss Cushing slipped into the room. Smiling slightly, she took a place standing against the wall behind her father. Without her glasses, she looked even prettier (and somehow vulnerable). Thomas was surprised at her presence; no other woman he'd met had ever shown the faintest interest in his work. In a rush of pleasure, he could not help but warmly return her smile, looking past her father to do so. Cushing noticed; he glanced at his daughter and frowned. When he turned back to Thomas, he said firmly, \"Turn it off, please.\" Startled, Thomas complied and shut down the model. The next few minutes became increasingly hard for Thomas to bear. He had experienced rejection before. But Cushing's words stung more than most, because the young woman was there as witness. As Cushing listed the cities where Thomas had \"tried – and failed\" before, the younger man shot a glance at Miss Cushing, both compelled to find out and dreading her reaction to his failures. She lowered her eyes quickly, avoiding his scrutiny, and he could not read her expression. His stomach sank, but as he wrenched his attention back to the businessman's lecture, Thomas set his face into a mask of polite attentiveness. Behind it, he wondered glumly what the excuse would be this time. Too young? No proven engineering experience? Not canny enough for the world of business? When Cushing gave his reasons, he managed to shock Thomas, because they struck at him personally – softest hands and privilege, indeed! He felt the vein of accumulated resentment that always ran deep under his carefully polished persona threaten to surface and explode. In the past, he had taken the dismissals quietly. Now, though, he could not swallow being humiliated in front of this young lady. He managed to control the rage that threatened to burst from him, but still spoke more passionately to Cushing than he had ever managed to speak in his life. When he'd finished, almost panting from the intensity of his feelings, the other man merely raised one eyebrow in surprise. A wheezing chuckle stopped Thomas before he could react. It came from the old lawyer. Ferguson leaned across the table and said, still chuckling, \"Carter, I haven't heard a young man speak that fiercely to his elders since – oh, since you lectured Abernathy senior into giving you your first contract for concrete delivery! As I recall, you hadn't much but your determination going for you then.\" Cushing gave a slight sideways nod, acknowledging the point, but didn't speak. Another man, though, asked, \"Why not at least hear the fellow out? I for one am intrigued by his machine.\" A few more of the men nodded or murmured in agreement, and Cushing shrugged, acceding to the group. But when he looked back at Thomas, his eyes were still cold. As Cushing turned to pick up the prospectus, Thomas dared a glance at his daughter, but saw only her back as she left the room. He was somewhat glad to see her go at this juncture, for she had unexpected effects on his behavior, and he needed all his concentration for the investors' next questions. In the jumble of Thomas's thoughts as he left Cushing's offices – the businessmen had agreed to a second meeting! – one demanded attention: the person with whom he most wished to share this news was… Miss Cushing. That idea made him stop suddenly, though he was in the middle of the sidewalk. Not to have thought first of telling Lucille felt as if he'd betrayed his sister. But as he took a deep breath to stop his panic, he hit on a justification for his sudden desire. Miss Cushing could give him valuable insights into her father's character, and such knowledge could help him win Cushing's approval. (That Cushing's approval would in turn gain Thomas easier access to Cushing's daughter would only sweeten the success.) Thomas nodded once to himself as if to cement his clever idea, then resumed his walk to the hotel. He would approach Edith at the reception this evening, he decided. His pace slowed as he envisioned it. Not so much their conversation, though he hoped she would be pleased by his success thus far. No, mostly he saw them dancing together – his hand on her trim waist, her warm gaze meeting his openly, the flush on her skin and the rise and fall of her breasts as he led her faster and –- A workman jostling against him startled Thomas from his daydream. Others around him looked to be headed home at the end of their work day, so he lengthened his stride to make up time. Lucille greatly disliked it when he was late. At the hotel, he would have to report his day's activities to her. As he hurried there, he uncharacteristically made a resolution. For once, he would keep a secret from his sister – that he had real hope this time, and that if he won what he now dearly wanted, his path would take him away from Allerdale Hall for good. Thomas has made his first choice... Notes : Not beta'd (due to a challenge deadline), and only my third fiction, so helpful feedback is welcome! Also, I'm thinking of making this a chapter story, with a shift to an AU after a couple more chapters. Do you think readers in this fandom would be interested in something that's more on the romance than the horror side of Gothic Romance? (It will have some gothic moments, and the ending may or may not be happy, but I want to focus on Thomas's choices and their consequences.)

Sometimes it seemed she could not think clearly at all, as if parts of her had ebbed away into the great emptiness outside as she played and left behind only a tenous knot of hatred and desire and need, twisting together like smoke. The house moaned about her — Home , she remembered, home and yet a burden — but the fire that flickered forever in the hearth, translucent over dead ashes, did not gutter or blaze up to the long-drawn breaths of the east wind, and the notes of the piano beneath her hands woke no answering vibrations in the air. There was no reply at all, no presence anywhere. She was utterly alone. Thomas. She had not known what she needed; the name welled out of her from some place deeper than memory, deeper than thought itself, spinning together wavering strands into a sudden focus of panic and loss. Thomas— Thomas! She whirled up in panic, knowing now what it was she could not find. He was gone. He could not be gone. They could not take him from her. She could not be left here by herself for always. He could not leave her. He had promised. She had made him promise. Never apart . It was a litany. Never apart . Her piano forgotten, she began to drift through the house, desperately searching. The roof had come down at last in the west wing, just as it had failed long since in the great hall where the dead leaves drifted at the foot of the stairs, and the wind sent in little dry flurries of snow along the corridor outside her room, and toyed with the ragged counterpane. In her shattered mind it was another midwinter so very long ago, and she was seeking Thomas as a terrified child, fingers twisting in her long dark plait, half-sick with guilt and fear. Father had been out of the country again, in Monte Carlo, and their mother had been asked to a house-party for Christmas at Haversett, a four-hour drive away across the moor. There would be dancing, and glittering company, and children were not invited, Lady Sharpe had told her small, excited daughter in a tone of dismissal that left no doubt. Even at eight years old she had begun to understand that Mother did not want them, had never wanted them, and that if their father had been home Mother would not have been permitted this excursion either. Mother wanted nothing more than to escape them all, and for one precious night she would do so; wear jewels once again in the thick dark hair that had yet to go iron-grey, and pretend for one last time that she was a girl again in London, and not an aging wife trapped in a marriage of mutual misery in the barren wilds of the north. There could be no question of driving back that night. The children would be left to their own devices under the desultory care of Jenny, the nursery-maid, and the coachman would bring Lady Sharpe home in the morning. A whole day and a night on their own, to run as wild as they pleased without fear of scolding or punishment! It was almost as good as being allowed to go to a party — a real party like the ones in story-books, not an evening full of boring grown-ups. And both children had seen enough to know by then in their secret hearts that there would never be any parties for them save whatever pretence they could make between themselves. Thomas at six had lost whatever trace of chubbiness he had ever possessed. He was a slender, elfin child with a shy smile that bloomed for his sister alone and a flinching look in his wideset eyes that she did not share. At the age of eight she had long since learned to love him more than the cold, hostile woman who had borne them; she loved him sometimes with a protective fervour that made her heart ache, but no trace of womanhood had yet come to stir her passions into forbidden desires and bewilderment. They were innocents, still, the two of them, and inseparable. They had played all afternoon at making their own private Christmas tree up in the nursery, using candles stolen from the kitchen when Mother was not there to forbid it, and childish baubles made in paper and scraps of wool to Thomas' devising, hung on a bough his sister had dragged in from the park. It was Thomas, younger than she, who had first tired of the game and clamoured instead to play hide-and-seek, but the idea had instant appeal. With both parents out of the house, it had been a golden opportunity. They'd hidden themselves in all the forbidden places, pulling open doors and fingering furnishings in the rooms they were not allowed to touch. Greatly daring, she had crept in amongst Mother's dresses, concealing herself with the crisp taffeta that little girls' sticky fingers must not crush, and pulled aside the heavy drapes over the alcoves in their father's bedroom, pretending she could not hear her brother's breathless giggles from the telltale mound under the counterpane. Thomas had hidden ineffectually between the legs of Mother's piano downstairs, and behind a coatstand in the corner, and curled up in the library with a pile of books on his head, and in the end she'd got bored of the joke and told him to go off and find a proper hiding-place. Then he'd disappeared. She hadn't been afraid at first. Not until she had searched everywhere again and again in the gathering dusk, and sour-faced Jenny admitted to hearing \"bangin' about an' screamin'\" and having thought nothing of it. The screaming had gone silent. That was the worst of it. She relived those hours now, mindlessly calling and calling his name. But the great muniment-chest in the attic with its treacherous catch lay long since mouldered and gaping like their father's bones. Once she'd flung back the lid in a panic with the last ounce of her strength, to find Thomas trapped insensible and barely breathing within its coffin-like confines; now it was no longer solid enough to ensnare a small boy, let alone a man full-grown, and the beloved she sought was not awaiting her there, nor yet when she searched further — much further — afield... Thomas ... A terrible knowledge lay somewhere beyond the edges of awareness, but she would not admit it in. She ranged out over the moor, slipping traceless between the whirling flakes. On the wet ground snow had melted and refrozen, murky with scarlet-tinted mud. At the foot of the high fells beyond, where the stone walls straggled down to the sheep-intakes, the ground lay churned by hooves and wheels on the steep track that bridged the beck and led into Coningsby. She'd ridden out that way, in the old days. A few narrow streets clustered round the market-square, with houses grey and bleak as the hills behind a church where the women had whispered and stared, and a handful of grander villas: the parson, solicitor, town clerk. There was a presence here. It drew her, and hate gave her fresh strength. The girl. Edith. In a low house near the bridge there was a lamp left burning in the parlour, lighting the room for any passer-by to see. And there she was, as bold as brass, sitting by the fire all huddled up in a mass of shawls. There was a drawn grey look to her cheek where the livid scar burned, and it was clear she had been ill — perhaps deathly ill. That was good; very good. But it was not enough. Hatred made it easy to pass through into the house unseen. She took him . Certainty came on a wave. She has him, I know it. She has him... There was a man in the parlour, but it was not Thomas. And he should have been dead. The American . Corn-fed, square-cut, self-righteous... The faithful follower. He had reached out to take Edith's hand as a brother might; but there were brothers, and then there were brothers. And the small steady movements of that hand for comfort told more than he realised, to one with eyes to see. He should be dead . She could not say why she was so certain, but she knew it. He too was gaunt, with an ashen pallor despite the Yankee tan, and he moved with the shaky care of the very old, or of the convalescent who must husband his strength, but he should not have been alive at all. Thomas killed him . A fierce remembered flush of triumph confirmed it: Thomas, and the interloper dead, and the look on Edith's face. And pride, in a brother ready at last to take place at her side. Yes, I— I made Thomas kill him. Blood. Blood on her hands, blood on his, warm and vital, binding them together. Always together. Never apart... Howling emptiness came over her once more. Yet instinct had not led her wrong, for it was of Thomas that they spoke, these two whom she hated. ~o~ \"You want me to perjure myself for Thomas Sharpe, Edith?\" \"Alan, please—\" \"You want me to stand up in court and swear that butter wouldn't melt in his mouth and that those corpses they dragged from the vats in the basement were all his crazy sister's doing, and that he didn't happen to sink four inches of steel into my gut?\" \"Oh, Alan, I'm not asking you to lie. Just... just tell them what they can believe. Do you think I mean to tell them about the ghosts? That Enola's spirit came to me, and all the rest?\" A sigh from Alan. \"It's about more than ghost stories, though, isn't it?\" His tone was almost gentle. \"It's about hushing up scandal; keeping the worst of it away from his precious name... So tell me — who is Sir Thomas Sharpe to me that I should shield him from everything he ever did to you?\" \"My husband.\" Edith turned her hand over softly in his clasp, and withdrew it to brush for a moment against his cheek. \"The man who spared your life for my sake, the only way he knew how. The man who did his best at the last to save both of us, and paid for it. Oh, I can't forgive him either, for the lies and the love and the horror, but I can't hate him.\" Her laugh was a quick sob of breath. \"He said he loved me... You're a doctor: can you tell me how a man can court someone in cold blood and give her poison with his own hands and then risk everything to save her? It takes bitterness to survive in this place; he taught me that. Love isn't noble or pure — it's messy and ugly and tears you in two, just as he tried to tell me before any of this began. Only I didn't understand, not then— not then...\" There was a blind look in her eyes and she stumbled to her feet. Alan struggled to follow suit and catch her as she swayed, but she had buried her face in her hands, and her words struck home oblivious. \"Oh Thomas, Thomas — why couldn't we just have gone away as I wanted? Oh, why did we ever go back to Crimson Peak?\" Alan could not hide an instinctive flinch of his own that mirrored the unseen onlooker's fury. But he reached out to Edith again and gathered her close, scarcely any more steady on his feet than she, while the wind set shadows dancing behind them in the fire. The heaving breaths hidden against his shoulder turned at last to sobs in truth, and ebbed away to silence within the quiet circle of his arms. \"There was a child that died.\" She was whispering the words as if that could make them less true. \"Her child — her own brother's child. How could he? Oh, it's horrible...\" \"He loved you, at the end,\" Alan said steadily above her bent head, gazing into the shadows with eyes that did not see. \"You can take it from me; you know I—\" He caught himself back. After a moment his cheek sank down slowly to rest against Edith's piled hair. \"You can take it from me,\" Alan said again, very gently, and for the space of a long breath there was no sound in the room save the desolation in the wind. Edith stirred, and looked up. Her voice was bitter with pain. \"She made him what he was; she caught him into that dance of death — Lucille.\" ~o~ Lucille . It was as if a great dam of memory had burst: hatred, betrayal and deadly purpose, sweeping away for a moment the anguish of what had just been overheard. Lucille. She was Lucille. She remembered... and for one instant of glory, she was almost whole. Only she would never be whole, not ever again. Thomas was all she had, all she would ever have, all she wanted, and he had betrayed her — for them . She remembered the cleaver. Remembered going after Edith to finish the job, as she had done with Mother, as she had done... No. No. She turned and fled wildly, away from that final memory she could not face, away from Thomas's lost and glazing eyes. He had not fought her, even at the last. He had been hers. Why had he not understood that? He was meant to be hers . She could not bear it. The wind whipped over the moor, tearing away awareness, tearing away passion, and somehow, she did not know how, the piano keys were under her hands again, moving and yet not moving at their old mindless pace. While she played she need not think — only exist as a shadow of what she had been. The house creaked and groaned on sinking foundations, rotting... dying. Everything she had done, she had done for the house, and for Thomas; to keep his inheritance and to keep him safe, the two of them left alone against the world. Of all those fortunes she had found for him she had not kept one penny. It was invested, all of it, in Thomas's hopes, Thomas's work, with her strength steadfast at his side. Lucille Sharpe wore other women's gowns ten years out of fashion and laboured in the kitchen like a scullery-maid. For his sake she had asked nothing for herself... save the child. She had wanted the child, when it came, with a desperation that shook her. She had always known she could not have what other women had: no slow, delicate dance of courtship, no flushed triumph to turn a suitor's head, no white wedding and no rose-petal cheek to nestle at her breast. She had Thomas, utterly, and from his bed her fierce delight. And in that all-consuming need the rest was of no account. They could not have children. She knew the risks of such a birth; even if she could pass a baby off as pity's impulse for some foundling brat, she had no desire to find herself endowed with some cretinous creature or incest-bred deformity. She'd brought up Thomas almost alone since she was old enough to remember. He was all the child she would ever need. And so she'd been careful, very, very careful, for all those years. Until Milan. Until that one sultry spring when she'd been distracted by jealousy, and hunger for comfort, and perhaps just pure bad luck. But by the time her brother had done as she bid and brought home another bovine, convenient heiress, there could no longer be any doubt. She'd felt the movement within her, and her shame had been starting to show. She'd hated Enola Sciotti, for her placid kindness, her lack of blame, and her unburdened freedom of movement in those months when Lucille dared not leave the house. The English lady's lover had left her? Enola's dear sister was not to worry. They would take care of the baby together. And soon, God and her sweet Thomas willing — a shrug of a plump shoulder and a blush — there would be another little one to keep his cousin company... She'd watched the other woman covet her growing belly with open yearning for a child of her own; watched Thomas with furious, jealous eyes lest he should weaken of finding excuses for his wife's empty bed. She'd felt little but scorn for the others, while they'd lasted, but she'd hated Enola and her little yapping dog. The woman should have been dealt with long before winter, for even such a fool could not help growing suspicious, but Lucille had been utterly dependent on her by then for the work of the house, humiliated as she was by her own ungainly bulk. A Christmas baby, Enola had promised, stroking her hair. A blessing on this house for the New Year. She had begun to cough. Lucille dared not give her the full dose, not yet, but she meant to waste no time once the birth was over. Thomas's child, she told herself when her imaginings that month were at their worst. And small Thomas had been so flawless, so delicate. Surely her baby would resemble him? Surely it would not be punished for what its parents had done? Of the confinement itself she remembered only pain. She had been past the age for a first child, but the midwife — summoned prudently from far Carlisle — had pronounced it a quick labour, and without complications. Exhausted, Lucille received the baby upon her breast with little more than a haze of relief. Then the tiny scrap of life uncreased its face and looked at her with Thomas's wide and wondering eyes, and she'd felt a pang of possessive love so fierce that it hurt. Her daughter was perfect; perfect from head to toe. In the distance she could hear Enola yammering — sobbing out some prayer of thanks, no doubt — but here and now there were only the two of them. She was cradling the smallest and most precious creature in the world. \"Lady Sharpe, my dear— Sir Thomas— I am so very sorry.\" The midwife was back. Lucille paid the woman no heed. Her eyes were all for Thomas, leaning over her with a look of concern. She smiled back at him, raising herself a little to show him their daughter. The midwife was patting her hand. \"Sometimes the Lord lends us these souls just for a little while, until he calls them back among the angels—\" \"What do you mean?\" Lucille snapped, trying to sit up, and caught her breath in pain. \"Thomas, tell her—\" But Thomas was gazing down at the two of them in anguish, and the baby had begun to cry. She still could not see it. Not at first. And then their daughter's head had fallen back to show the monstrous cleft that split apart her squalling mouth. \"I've seen this before, Sir Thomas.\" The midwife had taken his arm and was speaking in a low voice. \"That infant will just fade and fail. She can't suckle — she's born wrong. It's a blessing in a way, for she'll never really speak, you know, or learn as other children do... Your wife's a healthy woman; let her forget this child, then try again.\" Far away across the moor the Christmas bells were ringing out. Lucille had sunk back against the pillows and felt the first slow tears slip from beneath closed eyes. \"Lucille.\" Thomas had come to her, later, half-sick with misery. \"Do you want me to—\" She should have let him take that mercy for them both: Thomas, her poor Thomas who had never so much as drowned a litter of kittens and yet had made the offer for her sake. But she'd wanted the baby desperately, and instead she'd let herself believe Enola's lies. Enola had promised she could save the child. Promised she would spoon pap into it every hour, day and night, if that was what it took, as eagerly as if she had known that her own life, long since outworn like her fortune, hung precisely upon her utility to Lucille. The child had sucked weakly at the teat and choked up milk, and all the same finally withered and died. And Enola and all her possessions had gone down to join the other wives, like the used-up husks beneath a spider's web. Save that Enola alone had lasted long enough to understand what was coming. Lucille had hated her enough to make sure of that. Now they were gone, all gone, and she was alone and broken. Thomas should be here. He could not do this to her. He had no right... Dawn's first light drove her out again across the moors, searching desperately for a truth she could not admit. He was not in the house. He was not upstairs, where the papers had burned. He was not outside, where the snow had been crimson beneath Edith's stumbling feet and now lay deep and untrodden. He was not in that drained and waxen thing that lay unmoving in an icy outhouse, on a trestle alongside another, veiled for decency save for long dark hair— Edith! Edith was there, seated in Coningsby's adjoining hall amid a crowd of goggling rustics. Blind now to all else, Lucille swept down in a frenzy of impotent hate. ~o~ The Coroner wore a spotted silk handkerchief around his neck, and the jury had half a dozen mufflers between them. The coke stove in the corner gave out a little sullen smoke and less heat, but the room was abuzz with anticipation and there was scarcely a spare seat to be found. \"You may recall that these proceedings were previously adjourned on the grounds that the two principal witnesses were in no physical condition to give their evidence.\" The Coroner's dry voice creaked a little, as if from disuse. \"I'm glad to see that they are both present today and in considerably better health... I therefore propose to proceed with the evidence of Dr Alan McMichael. In view of your injuries, doctor, you are at liberty to give your evidence seated, if you prefer... Thank you: a chair for Dr McMichael, please ...the truth and nothing but the truth... Now, perhaps you would be good enough to give an account of precisely how it was these wounds of yours were acquired, and under what circumstances?\" \"I'm a family friend of Miss Cush— of Lady Sharpe, sir.\" Alan had made his way to the front of the hall using a cane, but his words now were measured and steady. \"When we received no communication of any kind from her after the wedding, I began to think it strange; when I subsequently learned of the tragic events at Allerdale Hall some twenty years earlier —the Beatrice Sharpe case—\" He broke off. There had been a rising murmur among the audience, as of old scandal recalled with pleasurable horror. \"Silence, if you please.\" The Coroner quelled the interruption with a weary glance. \"Dr McMichael, kindly continue.\" \"When I learned of that previous tragedy and of Sir Thomas's prior marriage, I became gravely concerned as to her welfare. And as you know, sir, in the event my concerns proved all too terribly justified.\" Further reaction in the hall, equally swiftly quelled. \"If you would kindly confine yourself to matters of your own observation, doctor? Evidence has already been taken on the subject of the... remains found in the basement.\" The Coroner cleared his throat. \"But in fact at the time of your arrival at Allerdale Hall you were not aware of anything of the sort?\" \"No, sir,\" Alan admitted honestly. \"My concern was that Miss Cushing had been trapped into a false marriage, not that she was in immediate danger. But when I found her on the floor—\" \"One moment, please. Would you be so good as to tell the jury in what condition you found her?\" \"She had suffered injuries consistent with having fallen a considerable height a matter of minutes earlier. She was also anaemic, terrified, and in my professional opinion showed all the signs of having been subjected to progressive poisoning. Given my existing fears as to her marital situation, I concluded that despite the weather it was essential to remove her from that house immediately.\" He hesitated for the first time. \"But when I challenged the Sharpes as to Edith's condition and the events of the past... Lucille stabbed me.\" \"In response to your verbal accusations?\" \"And my intention of removing Edith. Yes.\" \"So your extensive injuries were not the result, for example, of some quarrel with Sir Thomas over your attentions to the lady who was in fact his wife?\" \" What? No!\" Alan's outrage held utter conviction. \"I had been in the house a matter of minutes. Even had Lady Sharpe ever regarded me as anything other than purely a family friend, and I fully admit that it is with regret that I say she has not, there was no opportunity for any such misbehaviour or quarrel to take place. Lucille Sharpe attacked me simply in order to prevent my assisting the victim whom — in my opinion, then and now — it was her intention to kill.\" \"And you did not, at any time before or after receiving these wounds, lay one finger upon Lucille herself, even in self-defence?\" \"No.\" \"And how did you come to survive this frenzied attack?\" \"I lost consciousness.\" Alan hesitated again. \"Lucille must have believed me dead. At any rate Sir Thomas concealed me from her.\" \"From his own sister? Whom he had just witnessed attempting murder?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And then what did he do?\" Alan's mouth tightened, as if in remembered anguish. \"Edith was in danger. He went to save his wife... and there was nothing I could do to aid either of them.\" Heads turned in the court amid a low wave of sympathy as Dr McMichael limped slowly back to his former seat and Edith, Lady Sharpe, took his place as witness. She gave her identity in a low voice, and confirmed the doctor's story of her fall. \"And was this fall accidental, Lady Sharpe?\" \"No. She —my sister-in-law— pushed me.\" Another, indignant murmur from the audience. This time the Coroner let it pass. \"And why was that?\" \"I'd found evidence,\" Edith said quietly. \"Recordings — photographs — papers. Evidence about the dead women in that house, and how they died. She couldn't let me live. And when Alan —Dr McMichael— came, he knew too much. So he too had to die.\" Her breath hitched a moment. \"She was mad, quite mad, but I didn't know it until then. I thought— I thought I was the only one left alive. So when she came for me, I stabbed her. With my pen. It was all I had.\" She had begun to speak faster and faster. \"And then I ran. Thomas went to stop her, but he never came back. And I ran. She came after me, and she—\" With one hand she touched her cheek, where the livid scar of a knife still showed. \"She wouldn't stop coming. She would have killed me. She would have killed Alan. She wouldn't stop. So I hit her with the shovel, and she died.\" And amid all the tumult in the court her head came up, and she saw Lucille; saw her, as none of those around them could see. Saw her in a way that stripped away the memory of flesh and bone, and left only a shadow of immaterial rage. \"I killed Lucille Sharpe,\" Edith said softly as their eyes met. Every word was a weapon. \"She killed Thomas, and I killed her. And whatever remains of her now is less than nothing... only one more howling ghost amid those she left in her wake.\" ~o~ It was not true. It was not true. But the world and time itself slipped away from her clawing grasp, and she was back at the piano, back in the dark, back in the house where Thomas had betrayed her, and bled, and died with that terrible lost look as if it were she who had somehow failed him... When she screamed, it was the wailing of the wind in the chimneys, and all her frenzy could not stir the dust. Eternity passed. Edith came. Lucille struck at her, but Edith was untouched and unafraid. She wore primrose-colour, like the coming of spring, and beside that brightness the house around her seemed already withered in decay. \"I came to tell you we leave for Southampton tomorrow,\" Edith said quietly. \"You have your wish, Lucille. You fought tooth and nail to keep this house and lands, and now you need never leave. No-one will ever lay a finger on them again. You sacrificed every scrap of humanity you ever had for this, and now you will be part of it for all time.\" Locked away — alone — alone— Lucille fought in panic to shape the air through sheer force of will in an insubstantial throat. All that came out was a long moan. \" Thomas... \" Edith's face contorted. \"Look for him in the past, Lucille, for you won't find him here!\" She took a breath. \"The two of you were always chained to the past, weren't you? You kept him chained there by fear and guilt and love twisted beyond repair... until you chose to take a blade to that bond. Now he is gone ahead where neither of us can follow, to a rest that you will never know and I can only await. Did you think you could bind him to you for all eternity? We made our goodbyes, he and I; yours were dealt at the point of a knife. \"The inquest is over with Yuletide swift on its heels, and Thomas is dead and buried, no unquiet ghost. In their eyes, he died a hero's death, wresting the blade from your hands in defence of the innocents in his house against the sister he'd so blindly trusted... your last tragic victim. They'll remember you with horror, but he is clear and free.\" She laughed a little, tenderly. \"Poor Alan. He helped me, but he didn't like doing it. I used to be as honest as Alan once, before I came to Allerdale Hall... I haven't told him you're still here. He's suffered enough for my sake; he doesn't need your spectre hanging over us, ill-wishing us. They found for self-defence, and Alan and I are free to leave. We sail from Southampton in the New Year, and all this will be at an end.\" At an end for Edith, perhaps, but for Lucille— Drifting on the air, she tried again desperately to speak; to threaten or to beg, she did not know. But all that was permitted to her was the same long broken cry, and this time Edith herself lost control. \"Thomas is gone — gone, and you killed him. Is there enough of you left to understand that? You took him from me twice: once when he died, and once when you made a monster of him before we ever met!\" Eternity passed. Edith was gone, weeping. One winter after another took roof and walls, and what little remained of Lucille's mind. She could not remember who she was, or whom it was she sought. She knew only that she hated, and that she was driven by a single desolate need. The ruins of Allerdale Hall were reckoned ill-omened in after years among those who passed, even when men had long forgotten why. But the whisper had sprung up that, for those with eyes to see, the Black Lady of Allerdale played endlessly in a lullaby for the lost, caught in a hell of her own making.

Autre que l'hypocrisie de son milieu, les ricanements incessants, les petites manières, les manipulations, les minauderies pour séduite tel ou tel homme quitte à écraser toutes les femmes autour. Edith n'avait pas de vrais amis dans ce monde écœurant. Elle n'avait jamais voulu faire partie du rang, elle était trop vive, intelligente, perspicace, mesurée pour se laisser avoir par la stupidité de son milieu. Edith avait du cœur. Pour son père, qu'elle pleurerait plus tard dans une morgue. Pour Lucille, avant de découvrir qui elle était vraiment. Pour Thomas, qu'elle allait aimer passionnément pour se transformer en la femme qu'elle ne parvenait auparavant pas à être. Edith avait toutes les qualités pour s'élever. Elle avait juste besoin d'un coup de pouce, d'une nouvelle rencontre pour quitter ce monde qui la maintenait dans une condition qui la consumait. Elle avait rencontré Thomas. Edith ne se laissait pas manipuler facilement. Elle ne faisait pas confiance facilement. Surtout aux hommes. Mais elle était aussi sincère, vivante, rieuse, joueuse. Malgré la mort de sa mère, malgré ses dons qui lui avaient toujours fait peur, malgré sa solitude, elle se tenait à ses opinions et à sa droiture. Elle avait senti chez Thomas quelque chose de spécial. Elle n'avait compris la folie de Lucille que bien plus tard. Elle avait accepté les avances de Thomas, de danser avec lui, de l'accompagner. Elle s'était laissé avoir. Parce que malgré sa droiture, Edith espérait que quelqu'un s'intéresse à elle. Autre qu'Alan, qu'elle aimait comme un ami. Lorsqu'il s'était tourné vers elle pour danser, elle avait tenté de le ramener vers celle qui était normalement son parti. Danser devant tant de monde avait été une épreuve pour elle n'en gardait pas un mauvais souvenir. Thomas avait changé sa vie au delà de ce qu'elle espérait... Ou non. Il lui avait fait découvrir l'amour, la proximité, les rires. Elle avait aussi découvert l'horreur, le deuil, la manipulation. Les cris, la colère, le désespoir d'être pardonné par celui qui avait changé de camp. Rencontrer Edith avait fait basculer les opinions de Thomas, brisé le lien exclusif qu'il entretenait avec sa sœur. Thomas était un enfant perdu, qui à l'âge adulte suivait toujours ce que lui dictait sa sœur, qui lui demandait d'accomplir les pires horreurs sans sourciller. Ca avait l'air de l'amuser. Mais lui aussi savait manipuler, mentir et Lucille ne l'avait pas compris. C'est pour Edith qu'il n'avait pas tué son ami d'enfance venu la sauver. C'est pour Edith qu'il avait tenté de convaincre Lucille d'arrêter tous ces meurtres, pour commencer une nouvelle vie ailleurs. C'est pour Edith qu'il s'était interposé pour stopper son empoisonnement quotidien par Lucille. Il avait choisi Edith sans s'en rendre compte. Thomas Sharpe avait t-il eu des regrets de ses actes précédents?Edith était la seule de ses épouses qu'il avait aimé, touché, les autres n'avaient pas eu cette chance. Toutes ces femmes manipulées, désargentées, épousant Thomas qui utilisait leur argent pour tenter de sauver ce qu'il restait de son manoir, de ses mines de terre rouge. Le manoir s'affaissait, tout ce qu'il restait de son enfance et de la vie qu'il avait eu avec sa sœur allait disparaître à cause de ces mines qu'il ne parvenait pas à exploiter. Alors avec Lucille ils avaient échafaudé un plan qui n'avait jamais laissé de trace, mais qui avait toujours échoué.Lorsque Thomas avait enfin réussi à exploiter ces mines, Edith avait compris la vérité. Il s'était détaché après toutes ces années de l'influence de sa sœ avait mûri, aimé, changé, avait pris ses propres décisions. Celle de sauver Edith et de la protéger contre la jalousie de sa sœur. Sa sœur qui l'aimait. Pas seulement comme son frère mais comme un tout. Edith était l'obstacle de Lucille. Lucille n'avait jamais eu que son frère dans sa courte vie. Lucille préférait enfant subir les punitions à la place de son frère. Lucille l'avait toujours protégé et guidé dans un monde sans amour. Le seul amour qu'il avait toujours eu était le sien. Lucille ne voulait pas perdre Thomas. Si on découvrait ce qu'il avait fait, il serait pendu. C'est pourquoi elle voulait se débarrasser d'Edith, trop perspicace pour leur propre bien. Mais pas que pour ça. Lucille avait compris. Lorsque son frère n'était pas revenu avec sa femme alors que la neige tombait, elle avait passé la nuit seule dans ce château où elle avait tant souffert, où le fantôme de sa mère continuait de les hanter. Elle avait eu peur pour Thomas. Elle avait craint ce qu'il allait faire avec sa femme. Elle ne s'était pas trompé. Elle n'avait pas supporté de le comprendre, qu'il le lui avoue. Le poignard avait fait son œuvre. Elle avait pleuré en tenant le cadavre de son frère dans ses bras. Elle avait voulu tuer Edith, la folie déferlant dans ses veines et dans ses cris. Elle n'avait pas compris qu'Edith n'était plus la jeune fille qui avait épousé son frère. Edith était devenue une femme, capable de se défendre et de tuer. Et c'est ce qu'elle avait se protéger, protéger les siens, protéger son ami. Ils avaient tout perdu dans cette histoire. Edith avait perdu son père, à cause de Lucille. Thomas avait perdu la vie et l'estime des deux femmes qu'il aimait. Lucille avait perdu la vie et son frère, le seul homme qu'elle avait aimé. Edith, la seule encore en vie, avait retrouvé son ami d'enfance, à qui son père faisait confiance et qui était venu la sauver. Qui l'aimait depuis toujours. Qui n'avait jamais fait confiance à avait quitté les Etats-Unis, bravé le froid et la tempête pour venir la chercher. Qui avait été poignardé par Thomas qui avait fait exprès de le laisser en vie, qui avait préféré s'en occuper pour que Lucille le croie de son côté. Il avait eu de la chance, contrairement à Carter Cushing qui en voulant protéger sa fille avait payé le prix de la vérité. Maintenant Edith devait vivre avec ses souvenirs et ses choix. Tout comme les fantômes des Sharpe, Lucille jouant toujours du piano dans son vieux manoir comme elle l'avait toujours fait et Thomas... Hé bien Thomas on ne savait pas où son fantôme était parti. Il n'était pas avec sa sœur. Edith étant capable de voir les fantômes avait caressé son visage une dernière fois, alors qu'elle venait de tuer sa sœur devant lui. La peine et l'incompréhension avait traversé le visage de la jeune femme. Edith avait d'abord aimé Thomas comme une jeune femme timide, puis comme une jeune femme soupçonneuse. Elle avait compris qui lui et sa sœur étaient et s'était sentie brisée en comprenant que l'homme qu'elle aimait, qui lui avait fait l'amour dans cette auberge une nuit lui avait menti et l'avait amené en son château pour son bénéfice personnel. Et quel écœurement et quelle peur, quelle trahison devant la découverte de sa relation avec sa sœur... Elle avait pensé pendant un moment que Lucille n'était pas sa vraie sœur. En la jetant de l'étage, Lucille s'était chargée de la détromper. You said you love me ! I do... Thomas aimait sincèrement Edith. Il l'avait choisi parce qu'elle lui semblait manipulable et avait été conquis par Edith. Parce qu'Edith était Edith. Il avait compris à quel point sa relation avec sa sœur était malsaine grâce à elle. Elle lui avait fait découvrir un autre monde que celui qu'il connaissait. Et ça avait été réciproque. Entre mensonges, manipulation, faux semblants et écœurement, leurs vies s'étaient transformées. Ils s'étaient trouvés. La vie les avait malheureusement séparés. Et Lucille ? Hé bien Lucille était le produit d'une famille violente qui l'avait amené à se rattacher à son frère. A 14 ans elle avait été amenée en maison de redressement alors qu'elle venait de tuer sa mère. Personne ne l'avait jamais su. La mère Sharpe n'avait pas supporté de découvrir les liens qui unissaient ses deux enfants. Lucille s'était chargé de la faire taire. Lucille avait payé son prix, comme Thomas. Mais cela n'en restait pas moins triste. Et c'est pour cette raison qu'Edith fixait le manoir alors qu'elle le quittait en compagnie d'Alan. C'est pour cette raison que Lucille avait pleuré en voyant le fantôme de son frère. Et que Thomas en tentant de se faire entendre Edith avait semblé au bord des larmes. La loi du plus fort. C'est ce qu'Edith avait compris, c'est ce qu'elle avait appliqué. La vie était belle, violente, cruelle, puissante. Et on devait se débrouiller avec. Un jour, Thomas avait dit à Edith que l'amour n'avait rien à voir avec la perfection. Il avait eu raison. ","Summary":" Crimson Peak Edith Cushing avait toujours rêvé de quelque chose d'autre.

All rights belong to their owners. Note: This is my first Crimson Peak story and I hope you'll like it. After re-watching the movie on Halloween I thought it might be the right time to publish this little piece of mine. The movie has mesmerized me with its beauty and sadness and I really liked the chemistry between Edith and Thomas. ~Faded dreams ~ Not a sound could be heard but the silent breathing of the house . A thick layer of melancholy mingled in every corner and the walls were dripping in red. The air was cold, the night was still young and everything inside the house was touched by comforting darkness. A slim figure stood in this darkness, eyes closed and forever alone. Cavendish listened to the silent breathing, embraced the darkness and welcomed the melancholy with a sly smile on his lips. Time did not exist anymore, too fast was his mind for the slow process of time . Too heated was his body from his actions, too mesmerized was he from the silence that meant his freedom . Free-forever, being rid of the entrapping feeling of fear, yet forever tied to grief, no... guilt. Opening his eyes it were hers that stared back at him -not like he used to know them , not like he had learnt to hate them, but hollow and sad- a reminder that he had destroyed every light in them. Cavendish was paralyzed by the ugliness of the thing that he had created , still he stared at the ghost of his former wife with a composition of joy and a dreamlike absorption. Stretching out his hand he wanted to grasp for the desperate figure in the mist but when his fingers only ran through coldness and emptiness he finally awoke with a scream. O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O. Cavendish A character that Edith had created even before he met her but who resembled him in so many ways that it brought a frightening coldness to his heart. Guilt ridden and haunted by a ghost that represented the demons of his past, Cavendish was a miserable man trying to redeem himself by solving the murder of a young girl. Edith's hero was so close to be befallen by madness yet so strong and determined that Thomas could no longer hide his fascination. \"This fellow Cavendish, your hero . There's a darkness to him. I like him. Does he make it all the way through?\", he asked while his eyes were still fixed on the pages of his wife's promising first novel. \"It's entirely up to him\", Edith replied as Thomas walked closer to her and helped her preparing their bed for the night. Edith's response confused him . He was not familiar with the magic of writing so it seemed strange that a character was responsible for its destiny not the author. \"What do you mean?\", he therefore asked hoping that Edith would make sense of it. \"Characters ...talk to you. They transform...They make choices\", his wife answered with a warmth and loving tone in her voice that went straight into his heart. Touched by her words, Thomas looked away from his wife thoughtfully, his mind dwelling on her last words. \"Choices\", he murmured softly. \"As to what they become\", Edith replied not paying attention to her husband's mental absence. Could it be that he had the chance of a new beginning as long as he made different choices? O.O.o.O.O.O.O.O Long hours after their conversation and the beautiful night that followed, Thomas lay awake in their bed at Allerdale Hall. Edith was lying next to him , her breathing was unsteady and her dreams seemed to be clouded by darkness. She would die and it was his fault. Ever since his sister's return from the asylum he knew that he was bringing death to every woman he married , yet he had desired Edith like no other woman ever before-not even his sister. Finally he had found love that did not require a murderous price but instead of protecting the fragile form of this precious feeling he had led the poor innocent Edith into a world that was far worse than her nightmares. Not only the house in which they were living was falling apart but his soul seemed to decay quicker than ever before. 'Love makes monsters of us all' , his sister used to say but was he really a monster? There was one thing about Edith's novel and her hero Cavendish that wouldn't let go of him. Every character -every human being was given the ability to make choices so wasn't this his chance to get free of the encaging love of his sister ? Something that had started so innocent , something that had filled his body with love and joy had started to rot and become ugly a long time ago. He was willing to let go of his dark and unforgivable past , but would Lucille understand? Like a drowning person she hold onto him , onto their love trying to keep it alive although it had died after their third murder. He who couldn't understand why his sister had to murder everyone who threatened their love, was guilty of the blood on his hands and the sickening smell of death in the air, in every corner of Allerdale Hall. Like Cavendish he wanted to evolve, he wanted to make choices, good choices and redeem himself , get rid of the horrible memories that haunted his mind at night and even by day. Lucille however, had always been his guardian angel and he still loved her very much. There was an indescribable beauty that mesmerized and trapped him. She had given him shelter when he was feeling lonely, she had protected him from their brutal and loveless parents, she had been his light and his caretaker , yet he wanted to begin a new life with Edith. This old house with its creaking windows, its sinking fundament and its missing roof was calling him deeper and deeper into an all forgetting darkness and he was not willing to accept a destiny like that. He needed saving and the only way to do this was to save his beloved Edith , the woman who gave him hope, who gave him life again. He needed to convince Lucille that their madness needed to stop and that there was another way for them to be happy -he needed to teach her what Edith had taught him : That life couldn't be found in the past. O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O Ghost are real . This much I know . O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O Endless black was replaced by blinding white but the coldness stayed .What did happen? He couldn't remember .A fight ...he knew there had been a fight. Lucille had attacked him .Had he lost his sight in the process? No. Slowly and cautiously his eyes got used to the brightness and focused at the silent beauty of Allerdale Hall. Snow was falling on the ground , covering up the omnipresent red clay . Crimson Peak His home. His duty. His curse. O.O.O.o.o.o.O.O There are things that tie them to a place very much like they do us. Some remain tethered to a patch of land . A time and a date. The spilling of blood . A terrible crime . O.O.O.O.o.O.O.o He couldn't tell if it was the silence , or the permanent coldness, or maybe the sight of the innocent white on the threatening red but suddenly and without fear , he knew he was dead. The day he had met Edith M. Cushing. The day he had fallen in love with this beautiful , intelligent very special woman . That day he had hoped to let go of the past, to break the curse that was swallowing Allerdale Hall and its broken inhabitants. He had hoped to redeem himself from his murderous actions and allow Edith in all her pureness and innocence to wash away the blood from his hands like the snow did with the clay. In the end he hadn't been able to escape Lucille's grip , her power, her protection , her love and not even the brave Edith had been able to save him . His curse and their unusual love had murdered them both a long time ago-him and Lucille and so he didn't feel any pain when he watched how Edith put an end to his sister and their horrible past. He had realized that he was a ghost and that he had to watch the death of his sister because Edith had called for him . It was his last duty to watch over his wife and maybe he was allowed to say a last goodbye. O.O.o.O.O.o..O.o.o But there are others. Others that hold onto an emotion. A drive .Loss. Revenge or Love O.O.O.O.O.o:o:o: Indeed his wife got closer as she had collected herself and although he had seen hatred and disgust when he was still alive , he now only saw sadness and love in them . How beautiful she was and how wonderful their life could have been together. But he had made the wrong choices and she was now safe from him , from Lucille and from Crimson Peak. Maybe it was right this way and when Edith's warm hand touched his hollow shape , he could feel that she forgave him and that he was finally, and forever Free.

This once prosperous and grand façade has fallen into ruin and decay in no small part to its dark and terrifying history. For the faint of heart, do not, I implore you, read on. The story that haunts the truth in Allerdale's crimson soil is far more sordid than incest, more terrifying than ghosts, and more disturbing than violent murder. *In the early 1750's, contradicting the exact age of the house being in the hundreds, a moderately wealthy landowner named Ethan Sharpe began looking for a place in North Umbria to build a home for his wife and would-be family. The townspeople were wary of selling property and Ethan was unable to uncover why until he met an old hermit who lived near the outskirts of the township. The man, who simply called himself, Vole, was an eerie and twisted creature with a smile that seemed to have been turned up at the burning of an innocent child, fingers twisted at the ready to grab the wealth of the newly deceased, and strange eyes that seemed to have peered into the void of hell. But since Vole was the only man willing to divulge information about the perfectly acceptable, at least it seemed acceptable, land to Ethan Sharpe, he paid him handsomely and walked with him to the site to hear the tale. \"The soil's red, you see,\" Vole said with a wicked grin as he licked his twisted lips. \"Red like blood, evil blood, the blood of the damned.\" \"The damned?\" Sharpe asked with a forced laugh, trying to stifle his own disgust and fear at this. \"Aye. Twas a toueni of a different sort that spread across these cursed fields,\" Vole continued. \"It weren't witches or Druids that came here for executions and sacrifice, it were vampires.\" \"There are no such things as witches and vampires and Druids did their deeds among trees,\" Sharpe countered, hoping his reason could soothe his now thundering heart. Not just the presence of vampires, but executions of them? \"By the 'undreds,\" Vole continued as if having heard Mr. Sharpe's thoughts and lit his own pipe as a blast of cold began to blow. \"Their blood and bone cannot be destroyed in mere earth, there are only two ways; sunlight, or the fire of hell.\" \"And you believe that this land had flares of the sun scorching it daily, do you?\" Sharpe asked, loathing to hear the other reply that was sure to follow. \"The sun is the sun. You can see where it is and where it always will be,\" Vole spat back with a cough and gag. \"And vampires isn't keen on killing their own kind with something like sunlight. It's considered a sin to them.\" \"Vampires believe in sin?\" Ethan Sharpe continued, hoping to guide the conversation to a better place; or at least better than the turn it was taking at the moment. \"All damned creatures believe in sin,\" Vole replied, he grasped the walking stick he'd been using and suddenly thrust it downward. Ethan heard a sickening 'slock' as the cane sunk into reddish mire and continued to do so. \"From here on, clear up to that pile of stones, is Crimson Peak. The locals that recall the three executions still call it that and mark my words, they'll call it that again.\" \"Because of the clay in the grounds?\" Ethan Sharpe asked, a thought forming. Red, rich clay was needed in the budding cities to make bricks for larger, taller, better factories and homes. He was standing in front of a blood-red goldmine. Vole laughed and yanked the cane back up out of the ground, covered in red silt and clay as if dripping with old, clotted blood. \"You might say, sir, you might say; but it's the moths what gives away its true nature.\" \"Moths?\" Ethan Sharpe said mindlessly; already planning a mine, a mill, a workhouse, and a mansion for his estate. \"What sort of moths?\" \"Deathcapii,\" Vole replied with a wicked grin. Ethan felt a little stunned at this and turned, staring at the giddy disfigured creature hobbling alongside him. \"Deathcap moths mate and mate and mate then grow just at the temperature of a rotting human corpse. They mate with whatever's nearest them that is them, even their own kin. The problem is that the only ones that make it past their pupae is the ones from the parents what aren't related. The rest, well, the rest remain in a crimson cocoon, a carapace made a coffin that mixes with the already cursed ground. It's what feeds them.\" \"Feeds who? I'm afraid I'm not following you, Mr. Vole,\" Ethan Sharpe said in exasperation. The little man halted and held his walking cane up at the man's face in a harsh warning gesture. \"Listen closer, then, you wet-eared whelp. I said only two things can kill a vampire, sunlight and fire from hell. The one takes a few moments, the other, takes years.\" \"So you expect me to believe that some sort of rite brought about a field of underground hell-fire, that vampires congregated here thrice to kill off hundreds of their own kind, and that now the Deathcap moth pupae feeds these dying vampires as they . . . decay?\" \"Decay is all what happens here,\" Vole continued as he turned and began hobbling forward again. The sky suddenly began to grow dark and a blast of cold air hit the two. Ethan pulled his cloak more tightly around him and held his hat on tight. \"Decay and damnation.\" \"Ah, then I should get an opinion about the elemental nature of the soil from a more geologically inclined expert,\" Sharpe said, his voice rising above the wind. Vole turned around, his eyes suddenly wild and wide open; black and shining with hunger and hatred. He opened his mouth and let out a growl and a hiss, revealing not teeth, but rows of sharp fangs, He leapt at the aristocrat who let out the loudest scream he could before hitting the ground. Vole's strength was unimaginable and for a brief moment, Ethan Sharpe swore he saw claws on the ends of the man's twisted fingers. \"You'll do,\" Vole hissed, \"You and yours. Cursed be the name you bear, cursed the children your wife will bear as well. For a hundred years you'll be covered in blood; servants, miners, mill-men, and then your own family will consume itself.\" As Vole finished the last few words he clawed away the cloak, coat, and shirt over Sharpe's flesh and bit deeply into his shoulder. Ethan Sharpe's widened with terror as the beast that had been Vole a moment before stayed affixed like a leech to his shoulder until his eyes turned the same crimson red as the ground. Vole then pulled away, leaving a painful, gaping set of wounds. Ethan watched, horror filling him as Vole reached one hand into the clay, digging a shallow hole. He knelt over it and spewed every drop of blood he had taken from Sharpe into its hollowed surface. After the last few remnants spilled, he wiped his mouth with his filthy sleeve and then covered the hole with a wicked laugh. Ethan, still lying on the ground panting and bleeding, saw the old man begin to disappear, still pointing the walking cane at him. \"Their blood, our blood, your blood, will forever stain this land,\" Vole laughed with such a dreadful cackle that Ethan felt his head throb all the harder. As the last few wisps of proof that Vole had even existed dissipated into the air, Ethan heard him whisper one last sentence. \"Welcome, Sir Sharpe, to Crimson Peak.\" Historian's Note: It is unclear whether or not Vole died in the ensuing storm that Ethan Sharpe stumbled out of and back into town. The wound on his shoulder had been made by some sort of wild beast, though it hardly seemed like a bite. During his fever, he continued to mutter the words 'Crimson Peak' leading the locals to recall the name of the region during its snowy season and believing that the area was stalked by a wild and mangy wolf of some sort. In any case, upon his unusual recovery, retaining a pallid complexion and propensity for doing with little sleep, Ethan Sharpe began construction on the most ornate mansion and a mine in the most remote area possible near where it was assumed that Vole had disappeared. Later excavation found nothing but a walking stick, an old pipe, and for whatever reason a store of blood whose genetic traces were of the Sharpe family itself. i Touen – old Pagan or Druid grounds for mass sacrifice or execution. Seen also in Stephen King's 'Crouch End'.

A painful beat with every stumbling step he took through the sludge and snow. Each slow step hurt, his vision swimming and his right side numb. Chest aching as well, it felt as if his heart was splitting, broken by Lucille's betrayal. He had held onto a foolish hope that they could live together peacefully, as three of them. It seemed though, that his blinders had been removed, forcing him to look at what he had been helping Lucille hide. When he turned the corner around his machine, that vision turned albatross, he saw Edith with a shovel in her hands. She looked so terrified he almost didn't notice Lucille until she turned to face him. Thomas meant to be brave, truly he did, to face his sister and subdue her despite his wounds. But he froze when his eyes met hers. Wild, manic, and full of hate. He had seen Lucille angry at him, she was furious at him enough to stab him. The burning hatred made him feel as if he stood at the gates of hell. Thomas expected her to charge at him and finish him. Eyes on him she snarled something at Edith. He wasn't able to hear it or Edith's reply over the swirling snow. But with a swing of the shovel in her hands Lucille was lying lifeless in the slush and mud. Edith turned to him, shovel still in hand and for a brief moment he envisioned her taking the metal to his skull next. He dearly deserved it. He spread his good arm wide, unable to move his right and willed her to do as she pleased. Her hands trembled around the shovel, before dropping it, sending clumps of red snow scattering. \"Thomas?\" He wasn't sure what came out of his mouth, be it her name or a plea. Whatever words he uttered, he found himself in her arms. Her lovely white nightdress almost full scarlet with blood. Her blood, his as well; and Alan's, Lucille's, the thrice damned clay of this horrible place. He was sobbing against her shoulder, the salty tears stinging his injured eye and making him shake like a leaf. The next few hours were a blur of pain, he was aware of being taken into town. Murmurs that the hospital was too far in this snow. He wasn't quite sure where he was until a stern-faced matron informed him that he was in the doctor's own house. Him, his wife, and their friend. The woman's face softened when he begged Edith's condition. She informed him that she rested, in much better health than he and Alan, napping in the room beside his. Thomas dozed for a few hours in a haze. The doctor and his assistant bandaged him, the best they could. Making sure Thomas was drinking the medicines and tea they place in his shaking hand. The doctor, a tall man with more hair on his chin than his head, helped Thomas into a worn nightshirt. Probably the doctor's own, judging by how long it fell on his shins. Once awake and near lucid, Thomas lay in bed for no more than half an hour, trying not to think of Lucille. Betrayal mixed with love and it tasted like blood. When he began to hear her voice he pulled himself from bed. Whimpering, but not stopping until he stood before Edith's door. He knocked softly on her door. Pushing it opened just slightest amount, whispering her name. When she beckoned him to open the door in full he trembled in the threshold. \"…I... Edith, please. May I stay with you tonight?\" \"Why?\" Many excuses were on the tip of his tongue, but none of them good enough. They all boiled down to one simple reason that he spoke in earnest \"I'm frightened.\" For a moment he felt like a small child again, but now he couldn't hide from what frightened him. His only choice was to face it. And he wanted to do it by Edith's side. But he hoped, oh how he hoped, that he wouldn't have to face them tonight. \"Ghosts won't come if we're together, right?\" he whispered, afraid to reach for her. Edith though, she knew more than he gave her credit for. As always. Her hand reached out, begging him to come in. \"They never have,\" was her soft reply, and he nodded, swallowing hard. His good eye focused on the floor, taking careful steps, but he felt all her attention on him. \"Are you afraid of her?\" \"I don't want to see her, not yet.\" He shuddered, both at the painful ache Lucille caused and the chill of the floor on his bare feet. With her own body trembling, Edith helped him climb into bed before settling back down into her pillows. There was enough space between that that Thomas felt a chill at his back. But Edith's calm and steady breathing, so unlike the howling winds of the hall, soothed him like nothing else. The nights in their marriage bed seemed a blur to him, he avoided the bedroom as much as he could. To save them both from Lucille's wrath. The few times he spent the night by Edith's side, he focused on her breath. Trying not to feel his chest clench as her hacking cough became more and more prevalent. Now though, her cough faded under the attentions of the doctor. Not cured, no, not yet. But her coughing fits were far between. He hoped she no longer coughed up blood. She had bled enough since her acquaintance with him. He was more than willing to bleed for her now. Anything she demanded, anything as long as she would let him stay in her presence. -x-x-x- Two days later the snow cleared. Or it had cleared just enough to cart the three injured to the hospital in the city. Thomas hardly remembered the ride in, pain had returned with a vengeance when he awoke. Terrible shaking and sweats. The doctors murmured that he couldn't feel the pain because of shock before. Edith sat between him and Alan in the carriage. Her soft whispers to the both of them were the only thing that kept him remotely lucid. He knew she was injured, rather badly from his own inaction. Once arrived at the hospital she allowed herself to be coaxed back into a wheelchair. Her money and his family's reputation, earned them a few rooms at the hotel in town when the doctors could keep them no longer. Between the doctors and the hospital, Thomas had been assured that his arm may heal. Only if he kept the torn muscles immobile in a sling. Everyone was skeptical that he would ever regain sight in his eye again. He was resigned to death if Edith lived, loss of an eye was a small price to pay. He hoped it ached until the day he was finally laid to rest. He wanted to take Edith's pain and scars and carry them as well as his own. Anything to be worthy of her forgiveness. She was undoubtedly an angel. For when they relocated to the hotel, she offered him a place in her bed. To keep the ghosts away, she said. He thanked her with the whole of his heart. Knowing that his selfish nature would lead him to fear ghosts for as long as she let him seek solace with her. A few uneasy nights passed before he found himself whispering to her in the dark. Morbidly hoping for an end. Eyes closed, hiding like a coward, he laid his sins before her once more and dared her to forgive him. Hoping with a bitter burn in his throat she'd turn him away. Divorce him and leave him to serve his penance, knowing she is safe and happy without him. But Edith, this beautiful woman, only kissed his brow and told him: \"I forgive you. I love you. You chose me. You chose us . I will trust you again soon.\" That night he cried. Soaking his pillow, his back to Edith's sleeping form. His injured eye stung with the burn of tears. Tears for Lucille, her misguided soul leaving his aching in her absence, even as his heart was lighter. Tears for himself, cowardly in heart, selfish in nature. For actions taken, and worse, not taken out of fear and obedience. Tears for Alan, his care not even grudging, just wary and sorrowful. Tears for Edith, chest aching for her, so strong, so brave, and so unbelievably kind. With every tear shed he felt lighter. Edith's hand on his back the only thing keeping him from floating away. He hadn't felt the suffocating collar of the house and his name until they were gone. Not even acknowledging that something felt wrong until Edith's lightness began to burn his heart. As the weight of the past began to lighten he felt the uncertainty of the future edging in at the back of his mind. But those thoughts would have to wait. With a small smile on his tear streaked face, he felt Edith's easy breathing lead him into sleep. ","Summary":" His head was throbbing.

Holly's parents can be imagined as actors Adam Godley and Carol Kane. ~oOo~ At first glance Mr. Holly's apartment appeared to be devoid of furniture. Upon closer inspection worn fittings could be discerned scattered throughout the shadows, pushed tightly against embellished cream walls. Two chairs, an end table and a dark bookshelf, with its neat lines of books and accumulated curios, haunted the part of the room Holly imagined as the living area - his entire apartment being one small room separated only by invisible walls. The space entered the mind as a room half finished. A round champagne colored carpet was set in the centre of the wooden floor. A single window, with its second story view of the nearby rail-line, was the lone ornament of vacant walls. All photographs were kept in albums at his mother's house. In the middle of the ceiling was a single round lamp, its glass the color of amber. Fibrous brown veins were visible as though merged reeds beneath its chalky surface. The room was infrequently spotted with long panes of sunlight ridden with dust. In a corner of this golden light set a pot belled stove, a small pail of wood stationed near its feet. To the side of the stove a narrow cupboard housed tinned goods, jams and crackers. Holly often dined out and was therefore not well stocked when it came to non-perishables. When he purchased food, it was for an immediate dinner, usually sausages brought home from the butcher in waxen paper. Situated at the back of the apartment was Holly's bed, narrow and worn, but always well-kept. A wardrobe was to its side. Under the bed he kept hidden a water basin, a clove shaped hot water bottle and a bed pan. Light music from the gramophone of the proprietress' apartment downstairs morosely colored the entirety of his room in hues of moss and citrine, shifting as if with the sun's reflection on billowing water. ~oOo~ Having just arrived home, Holly crouched near the floor, searching through his tins and boxes of food. As he carried out the task, he felt something press against his ankle and realized it was his cat. He could see Bunt's thin black tail as it encircled his leg, her yellow eyes as they removedly searched his face and hands. Holly took a tin of fish from the shelf, along with a bottle of burdock and dandelion, which he placed on a table; something to celebrate with later. Opening the tin, he spooned some fish into the cat's bowl, sampling some before reprimanding himself. He ran his moist hands over his jacket and tried to remember what he next meant to do. He looked to his timepiece, realizing that he had a little over twenty minutes before his mother was scheduled to arrive. The cat was unapproved. When she was finished eating, he gently ushered her outside with his broom. \"You knew it would come soon, Bunt.\" By a jar on the kitchen shelf was peels from an orange which he'd gifted himself. Seeing the slips of rind, he crushed some into his palm, making sure the soft layers slipped under his nails. The scent was one he loved, and he hoped other people would appreciate him more because of its presence. Moving into the living room, he made subtle changes to his belongings, revolving a glass bowl, placing a chair closer to the wall. His mother would notice. She always noticed even the smallest of settings left out of place. Tonight, Emily, his mother, would be even more prone to emotion as the week was the anniversary of her husband, his father's, death. Samuel Holly, a tall, insubstantial figure, had been a fisherman before tuberculosis laid claim to him. Hezekiah's fondest memories were of helping his father unload catches by the sea. The sight and sound of waves were to this day a way of connecting to the past and his father's voice, now barely remembered. Being an eccentric and one who loved the sea, Samuel, knowing he was living his final days, moved into a small building next to shore, one normally used for storage. His friends, mostly fellow fishermen, visited him at night, sharing stories and music; provisions as well as spirits to ease Samuel's pain. Finding his father in his bed, already gone, had hardened Holly. Living afterwards was to face a world, an existence, worse than death. Holly's mother had fallen into a state of despair; one manifesting as an ocher lake from which she'd never recovered once submerged. The water always in her lungs. The same encompassing veil shrouded Holly, the same water stagnated inside him. Choked him in sleep. He attempted to busy himself with work. With the passing of time, his grief was not as encompassing as it had once been but still it remained. As a weight over his eye, his heart, areas of his being were forever to be devoted to his loss. His pain manifested as anger and will in the daytime and with night, he drowned in their source. Now he would be forced to reenter the depths with his mother in a room of gas lamps. ~oOo~ Holly 'facts': Lots of loose papers are usually around his apartment, spread on the bed and on the floor. Writes a lot, has bad penmanship. Tries to improve his drawing skills with little luck. Cleans shoes with a brush; can't afford the name brands but improvises. Cheap but for food. If it's for himself, he won't bother, but if it's for his mother or a friend he will splurge. Loves to wrap things in paper. Goes to market more than once a week, often just to see if any new sweets have arrived. Helps support his mother. Has a black change purse, which he keeps on him at all times. Goes, 'mmm,' quite often. His mother always kisses him on the cheek seeing him. He kisses her back. Nervous, as he's been through a lot. Is streetwise, not afraid. Has been beaten and has beaten others. Is not looking for love but wouldn't say no. Hair is smooth and mellow. Takes brisk breaths. Grinds teeth. Doesn't have much money or clothes, brushes, takes good care of the ones he has. Owns cologne, but rarely wears it. It's a rare thing for him to give gifts. His mother asks for comments on clothes. Has a habit of snatching sweets and food from market. Sometimes from crime scenes or \"friends.\" Doesn't like menthol. Holly's never broken a bone. Calls his fat old cat, \"you old buntcake\" and \"sack of potatoes.\" Associates citrus with happiness. His clothes smell smokey, like wood smoke. He sweats a lot, on face more than elsewhere. Never dresses down unless home alone. Is ashamed of body, embarrassed by it. His teeth ache. His shoulders are very tense, so is his neck. He has a pocket watch. Loves vanilla ice cream, prefers it over chocolate. Doesn't get much ice cream, so when he does go out for it he doesn't get anything but what he knows is good. Likes butterscotch too, though.

However I do claim all the original ideas shared within this fic. ::: Synopsis: Though lovely, every rose has its thorns. Alan and Edith return to America in hopes of a fresh start, while Allerdale Hall sits (mostly) vacant for the first time in decades with only the wind rushing through its ramshackle walls. Yet, even for ghosts, there is life-both bitter and sweet-after Crimson Peak. ::: The sky had been grey every day since their return from England. And every day Edith Cushing had spent by the side of Dr. Alan McMichael in his hospital room at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City. At first he mainly slept most days, and she would sit and knit or embroider, for she herself had barely the wherewithal to do much else at the time. Edith had mostly recovered from the poison that had been circulating in her system by that time, except the occasional bout of chills or dizziness that still snuck up on her from time to time. She had almost been too frightened to imbibe the antidote that the medics had first administered to her in London, but thank heavens not all rationality had deserted her, and at last she forced herself to take the proper doses each day. However, unable stand being in the country where the last of her innocence had been stripped from her and where she had first looked into the pit of true madness and corruption the world had to offer, she insisted that she and Alan depart for America as soon as possible. The medical staff assigned to Dr. McMichael did their very best to dissuade her, warning in the most graphic of ways of how likely it was that he would succumb to his wounds at sea. Still, others warned her that it was in her own best psychological interest to rest a bit more herself after such a traumatic event. Suspecting that they simply wanted an opportunity to ask her more questions about their ordeal, Edith roundly refused them all and saw that they were aboard a steamer set for New York within the week, proper notice of her and Dr. McMichael's impending return already sent by telegram to the staff at her late father's home in the city. It had indeed been the most terrifying voyage of Edith's life. With only a few staff members from the hospital assigned to help her bring Alan aboard the steamer by stretcher, for he was still heavily sedated for purposes of healing from his near mortal wounds, Edith felt very alone. At times she had feared that Alan would die as he battled fever by night and terrible pain from the wounds by day. Sometimes, it was all Edith could do to force down the bile that rose in her throat as she cleansed and redressed the deep red gashes on Alan's body. Yet, Edith knew she had to look at cuts to ensure that no infection began to fester, for if it did, the medics had said that Alan would surely die. Though Alan was weak, Edith knew he could tell how the sight of his wounds bothered her. He would awaken from his drug-induced fog and encourage her while asking her questions about how the healing was progressing, telling her how to search for signs of corruption. She was grateful for whatever support he gave her, but the isolation she still felt only reminded Edith all the more boldly of how for the past several months since her father's death, she had always had someone looking after her . Yes, Edith thought to herself, as she sat awake night after night, sleep never coming to her. Her inability, no, unwillingness to care for herself was how she had fallen victim to her wretched\"husband\" and his vile sister…. It seemed like it had been a lifetime ago that she had spoken of her desire to live a spinster's life, all on her own. What empty words those had been! Edith chastised herself, and thanked the heavens above that somehow Dr. Alan McMichael had had the foresight to come to her rescue. She had certainly needed a savior at just that moment or she would have met the same fate of all those other women who had met their ends at Crimson Peak… Now, she understood that Alan needed her though, so she needed to be strong. By God's will, at last they arrived at New York, where her father's most capable servant, a Mr. Daniels had already arranged a medical transport to Bellevue for Alan. There, the doctors said that another week at sea probably would have definitely led to more serious damage either by fever, infection or any other number of unspeakable complications that could claim one in such a fragile state. Indeed, Edith had gotten him there just in time. At her father's town home in the city, Edith was pleased to find that the servants had taken quickly to her advance notice to ready the house for her return. The furniture had recently been uncovered and proper cleaning had been undertaken. Firewood had been brought into the Great Room and Edith's old bedroom, and what it a comfort it was to find the fireplaces already alight, the flames dancing merrily over the logs. In fact, everything seemed almost the same as Edith had remembered since her childhood. And when she looked at the house itself, it was as if none of the terrible things that had transpired in the last few months had ever occurred. However, Edith knew she would find it almost impossible to get over the feeling that her father ought to be just around some corner in the house laughing, smoking his pipe, or offering some well-considered advice to the staff. Better that she pretend that he was away on an extended trip until she could get her mind around the whole of just what happened to her life. Though she had clearly returned home from England without her husband and, perhaps even more damningly, in the company of another man –convalesced as he was— Edith determined to say nothing of what had happened across the water. Especially, what had happened to her relationship with Sir Thomas Sharpe. Their sham of a marriage (though she wished to keep that fact from everyone else for as long as possible) had obviously made the gossip pages several months ago due to what she now saw, in hindsight, were the extremely odd circumstances surrounding their most ill-begotten union; at the time, she had simply disregarded the public shock as a product of the kind of inanity that often seized a class of people with too much money and time and not enough to do with either of them. How foolish she had been. Alas, the days passed, and Edith had to keep reminding herself that she simply could not continue beating herself up. Still, she found herself uneasy in ways she had never been before, and though she knew that she needed rest, sleep had remained elusive to her even after they had returned to the city. By night, she sat up reading for hours, frequently rereading entire pages of her books, so unable to focus on the material as she once had. By day, she took parts of her meals at odd times, often nodding off suddenly at inopportune times or finding her appetite just simply vanished all-together. She sat at her old writing desk in the sun-room occasionally, but this too proved particularly fruitless. Even though she had the strength to sit up and hold her favorite quill pen, she possessed no will to write a single thing. Several of the doctors who had seen her and Alan in England had recommended that she try writing down some of what had happened to them at Allerdale Hall, but the mere thought of that now turned her stomach. That and she could not bear the thought of having to explain to anyone what had happened, should they ever find her notes about it. No, she would not write it down. And so after spending several days \"resting\" in nigh oppressive boredom, Edith began making regular visits to Bellevue to sit and pass the days with Alan as he continued his convalescence. Initially, she read to him while he rested for long periods of time, awake yet with his eyes shut, for the regular doses of morphine made him drowsy. Sometimes she brought the crossword puzzle from the weekend post and gave Alan the clues during times when he was more lucid. Other times they just talked, mainly about nothing at all. Edith mostly shared stories about her new acquaintance with running the household, and her interactions with the staff. She had not yet begun to call on friends or look into the status of her father's business affairs for she was still not prepared to draw attention to their return. It would only serve to highlight her break from her supposed husband, who was still fresh on the minds of probably too many of New York society's best known chatterers. The time passed, sluggish though it often seemed to both Edith and Alan. As his doctors slowly decreased Alan's dosage of heavy medications, Edith found him awake and active when she arrived in his hospital room more and more often. Sometimes, Alan's mother would stop by too, and they would all sit and talk pleasantly, Mrs. McMichael having always liked Edith well. So with each passing day, Edith and Alan found themselves growing closer and close, just as they had been in the past but perhaps more intimate now. Unable to sleep some nights now that he had been laid up for week and no longer under constant sedation, Alan would lay awake, tracing the cracks in the ceiling of his room with his eyes, thinking. The things that Edith must have endured in that horrible house… He had hardly had time to process it when he had arrived at Allerdale Hall and immediately realized that he had to spirit her away from that evil place as soon as possible. No one would ever be able to comprehend what the two of them, especially Edith, had experienced at Crimson Peak. That would be between only him and Edith forever. And so Alan came to a conclusion: though he realized it might sound presumptuous, no one else would ever be able to understand and care for Edith after what had happened to her like he could. Actually, he loved her. He always had but had just not felt the proper encouragement from her in the past. And yet, now, despite how badly Edith had been burned by the last person to whom she had given her heart, here he was quite certain that somehow the two of them were drawing closer together by the day. So Dr. Alan McMichael decided that after he was fully recovered, he would make Edith Cushing his wife as he should have before. Granted he would do so at her pace and only at her consent, but he felt reasonably certain he could come to know both. Alan's recovery had been progressing extremely well for almost three weeks, when one day he awoke and began his usual daily wait for Edith. That day he awoke feeling particularly well, and when the nurse brought him his breakfast of an egg, one slice of toast and a small bowl of porridge, he ate all of what he was given for the first time in weeks. He even enjoyed a small cup of tea for almost an hour after his breakfast tray had been cleared away, when he realized that he was getting bored and wished that he had the paper or something else to read. Edith was running late today. Seeing a nurse pass by, he requested a copy of the paper for himself. No matter, perhaps something at the house had detained her, he told himself. It was perhaps it selfish of him to think that she had nothing more important to do than visit him. For a while he read, and after some indeterminate time, he fell asleep. Sometime later, he roused from his nap to find the sun shining through the window from a vastly different angle. How long had he been asleep? On the table beside his bed he found a tray with a lunch of lukewarm soup and a hunk of slightly crusty bread, telling that it had been placed there quite some time ago. Turning his head from side-to-side, he searched the room for Edith, but there was no sign of anyone having even been there. And surely she would have woken him to eat his lunch. It seemed that she would not visit today. Somewhat crestfallen, Alan McMichael sighed and pulled his lunch tray into his lap. As he pulled off a chunk of the dry bread with his teeth, he realized how disappointed he was. It was not as if he was mad at Edith for not coming, but he had been doing so well today that he had been looking forward to showing her. Ah well, he supposed there was always tomorrow… He was about halfway through his lunch when there came a light knock at the door. Edith! \"Dr. McMichael?\" asked a muffled yet unfamiliar female voice. Alan's heart fell instantly. \"May I come in?\" \"Yes, you may. Come in,\" he repeated when she did not enter right away. \"Dr. McMichael, how are you feeling today?\" the nurse, who he recognized only vaguely as one from his ward, asked a bit timidly as she came in. Gently, she closed the door and crossed the room to his bedside as he answered, \"Well enough.\" \"That's good, Dr. McMichael. But unfortunately, I have some slightly troubling news for you. Miss Cushing had a small accident on her way into the hospital today,\" she said. \"What?\" Alan asked, shocked, his eyes having grown wide with worry. \"Please don't worry too much. She seems fine now, but I'm afraid she took a little spill on the front steps of the building—\" \"When?\" Alan couldn't stop from interrupting. \"Around noon. Someone helped bring her inside and fortunately the on-call physician was available to examine her. Now, she has been resting for a little while in the out-patient ward,\" she explained. \"Did they find anything wrong? Do you know why she might have fallen?\" he asked, trying to sound calm but aware that he was probably failing. \"No, I'm sorry I don't know much. One of the other nurses, who works between the different wards, recognized her as your friend and thought that we should let you know in case you were expecting her.\" \"Thank you, that's appreciated,\" Alan replied, barely restraining himself from asking further questions. Eventually, Edith would come to see him, and then he would ask her himself. The nurse excused herself from the room. Shaken, Alan pushed the rest of his cold lunch aside. It hadn't really tasted that good to begin with and now he found that he had lost his appetite once again. What had happened to Edith? It couldn't possibly still be the Sharpes' poison, could it? Maybe she had just been exhausted. She had told him that she couldn't sleep at night. Or perhaps she was seized by a flashback that took her by surprise? He supposed she could be sick too. And like this, for the next hour or so, a variety of fears mixed around Alan's mind, each one more plausible or plaguing than the last. Finally, there was another knock at his door. \"Come in!\" he practically shouted, his voice coming out louder than he had expected. The door creaked noisly inward on its hinges, and a small hand appeared around the edge of the door. Wrapped in intricately woven light blue floral lace, those slender fingers allowed him to recognize their owner immediately, even before he saw her. \"Edith!\" Alan called sitting bolt upright in his bed. He would've gotten up and gone to her immediately had he been able. Her delicate features slid into Alan's view as she slipped into the room past the door, which she softly turned toward and closed. Hesitantly, she turned back to where Alan sat in bed. Her skin was pale but her cheeks were slightly flushed, and she looked well enough from across the room. Yet as she made no move to come closer, Alan felt as though he was leaning so far forward that if he leaned any further in her direction he might have tumbled right out on to the floor over the foot of the bed. \"Hello, Dr. McMichael,\" she greeted him softly, barely even looking up from the floor as she used his formal name. \"Edith?\" he was dumbstruck at her sudden coldness. He wanted nothing but to ask her condition, but he felt as if the breath had been knocked out of him. Shaken, he leaned back on the pillows. For a long moment, she stood in front of him, inspecting the floor, her hands pressed to the door, hidden behind her skirt, giving the impression that she was prepared to turn and go at any moment. Still, he had to know what was happening. She didn't seem to want to stay, and she didn't seem to want to go. What was Edith Cushing doing? \"Edith, a nurse told me… What happened today on the steps?\" Alan asked. At last, Edith looked up into Dr. Alan McMichael's clear blue eyes. Even with his fine golden blonde hair slightly overgrown and all amess from the pillows and a light shadow of flaxen stubble appearing around the lower part of his face, he was still so very handsome. How had she not noticed it those several months before? And, oh, damn it all to hell! Now, it was too late… far, far too late… \"I knew it, I should never have come here,\" she whispered, looking away from his penetrating stare. Alan McMichael was speechless, as she continued: \"But they told me that they had told you what had happened, and I simply couldn't just never come to see you again. Selfishly, I could only think how you might worry for me, if I didn't say a thing-\" \"Edith, I was only told that you tripped on the steps. I don't understand the reason for all this—\" \"No,\" she cut him off sharply. Her small hands appeared, wrapped in two tiny fists, at the sides of her pastel, sky blue velvet skirt. The light blue netting that dipped down to her cheek bones from her beautiful hat decorated with blue dyed roses and baby's breath trembled, and Alan wondered as he thought he caught the glisten of a tear on her cheek in the dull winter light passing through the dusty hospital window. \"Alan we cannot be together. Ever. You'll simply have to understand,\" Edith told him, her voice echoing harshly around the high ceiling of the sterile looking room. \"What?\" Alan asked, hurt sharpening his words. \"Edith, you cannot be serious. What is this really about?\" \"Alan, just trust me. We cannot.\" Her voice was trembling and suddenly, she turned to go, her skirt swaying dramatically as she grabbed the knob with both hands. \"I must go!\" \"Stop!\" Alan shouted, as without another care he pushed himself out of bed with more force than he thought he could actually muster. However, after only one step, he stumbled badly. Though he mostly caught his fall with one arm on the side of the mattress, he cursed bitterly as his knee smacked painfully against the hard tile floor. In an instant, Edith was at his side. \"Alan!\" she gasped in worried remonstration, as she helped shoulder him back into bed. They looked at each other for a long moment, her glossy brown eyes meeting his wide blue ones, when yet another light knock sounded at the door. \"Is everything all right, Dr. McMichael?\" a little nurse with a thin a face asked as she peaked around the side of the door. She flushed as she noticed the intimate distance been the patient and his female visitor. \"Someone heard shouting,\" she said with an embarrassed swallow. \"Yes, everything is fine, thank you,\" Alan replied forcing calm into his voice. \"I am sorry. We'll be more quiet.\" And silently the girl excused herself with a nod and shut the door. Alan turned his attention immediately back to Edith, who was perched on the edge of her usual chair by the side of his bed, tears now positively streaming down her face. He felt his fingers turning cold as she gripped his hands as hard as if they were made of steel. Wriggling his fingers, he managed to free one hand, in order to lift and tuck back her veil into her hat. He needed to see her face. What was she going through? What had happened earlier that day? \"Alan, I'm sorry,\" she ground out. \"I did not want come here and say any of this to you. I don't want to leave you.\" \"And you don't have to,\" Alan replied more gently, using his free hand to wipe the hot tears from her red cheeks. \"Yes, I do,\" she countered again. \"The most terrible thing has happened, Alan. I started to suspect it—no fear it —some time ago, but I did not suspect that things could get any worse for me. But they have, they have, \" Edith lowered her head and cried into his sleeve. \"Edith, my Edith , what could be any worse than what has already happened to us?\" Alan asked, softly caressing her cheek. It is alright, I am here for you, he thought. Stiffening, Edith pulled back from Alan's hand. \"It is him, Sir Thomas Sharpe ,\" she bit out the name as if it cut her tongue to do so. \"I am with child, Alan!\" she wept bitterly, and somehow he knew it before she even finished the saying the words. \"Edith,\" he said softly. But she would not look at him, and only kept her eyes clamped tightly shut as if to keep her tears from flowing out too fast. \"He is the only man I have ever known. It can be no one else's,\" she wept desperately. \"I have no idea what to do…\" she trailed off, on the verge of total despondence. \"Edith—\" he tried again, but still she cut him off. \"No, Alan, I will not allow us both to be ruined like this ,\" Edith gasped in pain, barely above a whisper. \"We will not be, but that is why we must be wed as soon as possible. That is… if will you accept it,\" Alan replied firmly, to which she could only look in startled amazement at him. \"But do you not understand what I am saying to you?\" she asked, almost frantic that he could choose such a thing. \"I am pregnant with another man's child. And that man —\" \"Edith, I do understand. And I love you,\" he answered, leaning over and taking both her trembling hands in his. \"I love you and nothing is to change that. I will care for both you and this child,\" he said firmly. Still, Edith looked stunned. Breaking his gaze, she glanced about wildly, as if by doing so she might yet still catch a glimpse of some future she previously was not aware existed. \"But how can we possibly be happy like this?\" she questioned and then suddenly fixed him with a half-mad expression. \"Perhaps, we can rid of it – surely, Alan, as a doctor, you must know someone who can do it!\" Edith implored under her breath. Without thinking, Alan drew back a bit from her. \"No, and even if I did, that is the last thing we should do. Not mention the danger to you…\" \"But what if, what if he or, worse yet, she comes looking for it? Out of hatred or for whatever other reason?\" \"But why?\" Alan replied evenly. \"Why would they come thousands of miles to seek vengeance on an innocent child, blood of their blood, flesh of their flesh? No, I cannot believe that Sir Thomas Sharpe or even his maniacal sister would do such thing. However, if we choose continue down the Sharpes' path of violence and bloodshed by getting rid of it, then perhaps, I'm afraid of what might happen.\" \"Alan,\" Edith breathed, speechless at how quickly and decidedly he had thought this out. \"But how can I ever love such a child?\" she asked at last speaking what was perhaps her greatest fear. \"I don't know,\" Alan answered her softly before he took her chin once again in his warm hand. \"But I know that I love you, and together we will get through this.\" With a shaky nod, Edith finally agreed, and leaning together with him, she allowed Alan to kiss her lips ever so gently. ::: Note: This may or may not be a one-shot, depending... though I can say have some ideas for future chapters.

However, I do claim all the original ideas shared within this fic. That said: Enjoy! ::: Synopsis: Though lovely, every rose has its thorns. Alan and Edith return to America in hopes of a fresh start, while Allerdale Hall sits (mostly) vacant for the first time in decades with only the wind rushing through its ramshackle walls. Even for ghosts, there is life-both bitter and sweet-after Crimson Peak. ::: Through the broken front door; up the dust-blanketed grand stairwell; down the drafty upstairs hallways with their peeling, faded wallpaper; at the end of one, dreary, long corridor through a bedroom door covered in cracked paint and omnipresent spackles of red clay, Sir Thomas Sharpe perched vulture-like atop a rotting rosewood dresser. Given the dark stain that stretched across the ceiling, which sloped where the roof angled down, Sharpe presumed that melting snow had weaseled its way in through some invisible crack in the wall. More than just the finish on the dresser had suffered for the leak. Depressed by the ever-present dinge and dank that surrounded him, Sharpe sighed heavily. Now, you might ask yourself why a titled man such as Sir Thomas Sharpe would ever choose this particular piece of furniture, this dilapidated dresser in this dilapidated house, on which to sit? Moreover, why would such a one sit atop a dresser at all? Well, Sir Thomas Sharpe, for one could not technically answer this question if he tried, for he could not actually sit down. For in fact he was dead, and upon dying he had learned that the dead, specifically ghosts, did not sit. Rather now, he hovered. So it was that he was hovering, lost in thought, when a certain stern voice, further accentuated by a strong continental lilt, disturbed his potentially infinite, ghostly mediation. \"Can you make her stop? \" Sir Thomas Sharpe focused his eternally sad, hollow gaze on the spot where his second-to-last wife, Enola, had materialized. Like a wave breaking on the tide, suddenly the cacophonous clang of un-tuned piano keys collided with the late baronet's eardrums (that is, if sound waves did in fact penetrate the ectoplasm of a ghost's inner ear at all; uncertain, Sharpe mentally filed this question away for later contemplation…) Damn it, he cursed a particularly nerve-shattering F-note. And he had so nearly successfully drowned out his horrible sister's maniacal playing. \"And what makes you think I can do that ?\" he asked, his voice soft with its noble accent perfectly, quizzically aloof. \"You certainly— ah, come si dice?—had a way with her when you were alive ,\" Enola replied pointedly. Ouch. Thoughts of his unique relationship with Lucille only stung Thomas all the more. And his equally dead wife only knew it too well. \"And let me ask, do you recall the identity of my murderer?\" he asked sardonically. Clearly, seeing that she was getting nowhere with her waste of an ex-spouse, Enola turned her nose up in the air with an icy \" hmph \" before disappearing through the ancient, dirt-caked floor. In a dark humor, Sharpe wondered how even a ghost could fit through the cracks between the wood with so much filth around, though he knew very well that was probably not how it worked. Then, again, Sharpe could not say that he really knew how these \"things\" worked at all. Listening to Lucille terrorize her piano keyboard and, by extension, the rest of their ramshackle abode, Sir Thomas Sharpe allowed himself to drift upward into the attic. Arriving in the middle of the room, mid-torso into his old worktable, he looked around at his once beloved workshop. His many trinkets and small inventions now slept beneath a thick, dull layer of dust. Ah, how he wished to wipe the dirt away, pick up his creations, turn them in his hands. Alas, it seemed he would never do so again, for since he had died and awoken on the \"Other Side\", so to speak, Sir Thomas Sharpe had found himself entirely unable to manipulate even a single object. How deeply unfair, he thought, feeling especially mopey at the moment. Honestly poltergeist-like, his sister had been able to bang away at her piano almost non-stop from the moment she had met her grisly fate. She had even been able to torture every other soul in the house with whatever make-shift weapons she so chose, wildly flinging about everything from kitchen cutlery to heavy chandelier chains. Yet, he was allowed no solace in being able to move the items that were most dear to him. Really, what good was the life of an inventor such as himself if he could not actually construct the flights of his scientific fancy, or at the very least, share his ideas with others? Feeling utterly bored and ineffectual for the millionth time since his demise, Sir Thomas Sharpe floated over to the window. He tried to imagine the feel of the ambient chill emanating off the smudged glass, but he found himself already forgetting the memory of such sensations… His mind wandered: how long had it been since Edith had escaped from Crimson Peak? Already a few months, he realized as he noticed patches in the red-muddled snow where it had begun to melt in the spring thaw. Were those even a few blades of witch grass coming up beside the stone wall at the end of the drive? Just barely audible over the strains of the piano now paired with his sister's wailing song (if it could be called that), he believed he heard Papillion's barking below. With nothing else to do, Sharpe apathetically let himself be drawn through the thick wall of the manor down into the yard below. As he settled a few centimeters above the frozen, red slop that covered the earth, Papillion rushed across the yard toward him. Smirking, the baronet thought of how the little mutt would have drown in the red mud had he not been already dead too. Somewhat sickly, Sharpe then deduced that Lucille had done the small beast a favor. I suppose I always did enjoy the macabre, he noted, hoping humor would ease some of the pain, as he guiltily recalled standing by while his sister snapped the silly creature's neck. \"Sorry, dog: If I do not laugh, I shall certainly cry,\" Sharpe told Papillion, as the toy spaniel danced around his legs, it's butterfly wing-like ears all aflutter. Clearly, the dog too was happy for some company in this dreary Purgatory that they all seemed to share. Before he knew it, Sharpe soon found himself following the dog to the edge of the property. Now, only several feet away, he saw clearly that a small cluster of slightly green weeds had indeed taken root beside the wall. Even in the most inhospitable reaches of the earth, he supposed, something must grow. He was inspecting the tenacious weeds when suddenly, and with no apparent cause, Papillion leapt up in Sharpe's face, yapping loudly. \"GAH! Dog, what in Hell's name are you doing?\" Sharpe exclaimed bitterly, his arm still raised to his face in shock. However, the little dog had already bounded away, easily passing through the heavy, black iron bars of the chained and locked gate. Unthinkingly, he followed the dog immediately, but on the other side of the gate, he saw mischievous canine spirit nowhere. \"Where the devil-?\" he scratched his head, unable to understand how the mutt had simply vanished. It was then that Sharpe turned and discovered the partially obstructed view of Allerdale Hall through the thick, twisted rungs of the wrought-iron gate. Disoriented momentarily, Sharpe soon settled upon the realization that he had wound up outside the property. He had not even gone beyond the manor walls for months! Now, he couldn't help but marvel at how malevolent the place looked from outside at such a distance. If Allerdale Hall had looked even a fraction as horrible as it did now when he brought Edith home from America, he wondered how she could have agreed to stay with him and Lucille at all. Edith. Turning away from the dilapidated shack to which he had dedicated his entire life, he imagined how for the last time she must traveled this road that stretched into town, only too relieved to still be in possession of her life as she left Crimson Peak behind once and for all. To leave Crimson Peak behind once and for all. The words echoed in Sharpe's mind. He had considered doing so several times over the years that he and Lucile traveled back and forth in search of rich heiresses to swindle and kill; however, it was Lucille who always ensured that they returned to the family home. So now, standing (well, technically hovering over) the red slush outside the manor's gate, it occurred to Sir Thomas Sharpe that for the first time ever, he had successfully left Allerdale Hall with no real compulsion to return anytime soon. \"Well, if the dog can do it, so can I,\" he said to no one in particular and began a determined drift down the lane into town, away from Allerdale Hall and Crimson Peak. ::: Note: Finally had time for another installment!

However I do claim all the original ideas shared within this fic. ::: Synopsis: Though lovely, every rose has its thorns. Alan and Edith return to America in hopes of a fresh start, while Allerdale Hall sits (mostly) vacant for the first time in decades with only the wind rushing through its ramshackle walls. Yet, even for ghosts, there is life-both bitter and sweet-after Crimson Peak. ::: It had been a cold, cold December, and Christmas had just passed when one afternoon, Edith ascended the steps of Bellevue Hospital followed by her newly hired head maid, Sarah; her late father's most capable servant, Mr. Daniels; and the family solicitor, Mr. Ferguson. It had snowed overnight, lightly, only perhaps two or three inches, but the morning had remained chilly enough that the snow still coated the ground evenly like glistening, sugary frosting on a cake. Reflecting off the snow, the afternoon light that passed through the ground level hospital windows therefore had a cool, icy cast, as Edith's little group processed through the halls to the building's South Entrance. As they approached the south side of the building, they emerged at last into a large lobby with black and white tiled flooring and wooden benches lining the walls, interrupted here and there by green-leafed, potted plants. Some patients dressed in hospital gowns and robes met with visitors here and there in the lobby, as it was Saturday afternoon. It didn't take long for Edith's eyes to fall on the patient she had come to meet. Though he was still technically a patient at Bellevue, not yet released by his doctors, but very nearly so, Dr. Alan McMichael rose from his seat dressed in a well-tailored waist-coat and fashionably tailed jacket. His cravat was neatly tied and his hair had been groomed and his face obviously just shaved that morning, as evidenced by the presence of his valet, whom Edith who had never met but recognized immediately from stories that Alan had told her during the days she spent visiting with him in the hospital. Edith bowed her head and curtsied gently as she approached her future husband, who also bowed slightly to her, when a moment later, two nurses in billowing skirts with pristine white starched aprons and expertly poofed white head caps approached them. \"Dr. McMichael? Ms. Cushing? Ye two are here for yer wedding, right?\" asked the one nurse. Ginger curls spilled out around her cap, and she spoke with a sweet Irish lilt. \"This is Pastor Beverly,\" the other nurse gestured, her voice slightly breathless and her face flushed, as she introduced a kindly-looking, diminutive older man. The pastor's white collar was just exposed above a heavy woolen burgundy scarf. In his arms he gently cradled a book with worn gold leaf-edged pages, and he and the nurses wore smiles as the greetings were finished being exchanged. It was obvious to Edith that the shy, young nurses thought that her marriage to Alan at the hospital while he was still coalescing was too romantic. She imagined that both of the nurses could not be more than 15 or 16-years-old, and having probably never done more than hold a man's hand in the dark, they were young and naive. They could not deduce that a man and a woman might marry at Bellevue Hospital with no witnesses present other than their staff for reasons other than passionate love and impatience. Able to stand by himself quite well now, Alan put his hand out and Edith placed a lace-gloved hand in his. Their little group passed by a tall, well decorated Christmas tree and through the large burnished metal doors of the hospital's South Entrance to the winterscape in the garden beyond. The pink brick walkway had been shoveled just far enough along so that the pastor could lead them just enough of a distance along the path. They stopped between the first two crab apple trees planted along the way. The authoress buried deep in Edith noticed how the the protective white paint covering the trunks of the trees made them look ethereal in their barren, leafless phase. If only I was barren ... a crushed voice within her inner mind ground out. Alan remained unwavering in appearance, as he took her second hand in his as they came together in front of the elderly pastor. \"Alright, the young ladies here have warned me that that I should keep this short as the patient really should not be out-of-doors like this in the winter weather,\" the pastor announced, a gentle smile on his face as he glanced from the giggling nurses to Alan. As the clergyman began to read a section from the bible he carried, Alan really did not listen. It wasn't that he did not care for religious things, but he was distracted by Edith's beauty at the moment. Looking over her, he admired her royal navy colored gown, the material clearly woven with a blend of silk thread given the way it shown in the dwindling, December afternoon light. The bustle, sewn of the same fabric, was situated stylishly over Edith's behind, accentuating her now-thin waist, so that it was impossible to tell that there could be a tiny life growing within her... He loved how the blue of her gown matched the dark blue velvet of his jacket lapels, their outfits coordinating even though they had not planned it. Draped over her shoulders was a black velvet cape covered in sewn dusky rose-colored rosettes. The tiny textile flowers perfectly matched pink and cerulean silk roses clustered at the sides of her face on her soft looking black bonnet. I n the cold air, h er skin was pale as bone china . Alan found the contrast of her paleness absolutely lovely against the dark material of her headdress. The pure white of the bonnet's lace bow tied under her chin only enhanced the effect. Edith was never one for make up or face powder, he knew, and yet standing all-natural before him, her looks were angelic. My God, she is beautiful , Alan thought. Just then, Edith lowered her head away from his gaze, as if she could sense his appraisal without realizing any of the adoration that accompanied it. Unthinkingly, he felt his breath hitch slightly in disappointment at having possibly made her feel awkward with his staring. \"Dr. McMichael?\" the pastor's voice came drifting into Alan's thoughts. \"Yes?\" he said tearing his gaze from Edith. \"In the name of God, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?\" the pastor said somewhat emphatically, clearly having repeated himself. Alan looked back at Edith, who looked back quietly at him, her gaze not giving away anything of her thoughts. I pray I will come to know your mind one day, Edith , he thought to himself. Still, firmly and sincerely, he replied, \"Yes, yes, I do.\" The pastor turned to Edith, who turned from Alan to look at the pastor, as he spoke, \"And you, Ms. Edith, in the name of God, do you take Dr. McMichael to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until you are parted by death?\" Edith looked down at the pink brick still patched with white snow in places beneath their feet. The memory unbidden, it reminded her of reddened snow she had seen before, not long after her previous wedding.. Until you are parted by death. A vision of Thomas' ghostly face flashed before Edith's mind's eye, tendrils of his phantasmal blood feathering in the air as if they had just seeped from his wound and grazed her hand a moment ago. Emotion rushed her, and hot tears sprung to Edith's eyes. Yet, Edith bit her lip, and fought for composure just as quickly as the tears had threatened. This time will not- cannot be the same, she told herself. Making her best attempt at a smile, she breathed and looked up into Alan's expectant face. \"Yes, I do,\" Edith vowed and kissed Alan McMichael for the very first time as his wife.

All characters belong to Universal Studios and Guillermo Del Toro. The only character that I own is Isabella. AN: This story is already on my Wattpad account I wanted to post it on this site.} 1. Home Isabella's POV I hadn't been home for awhile and had been enjoying my year in Europe. My life at home in New York had never been in my words pleasant. Ever since my mother died my father and Edith blamed me for my mother's death. Like most Victorian children we lost a family member to a fever or cholera. I caught the fever first and then my mother caught it be trying to take care of me. She died and I survived. Everyone in Buffalo, NY knew how my father and sister treated me yet know one said anything about it to my face. They whispered it among themselves. \"Bella, Wait up.\" I turned around and saw my childhood friend Allen McMichael who family had treated me like I was one of there own than my own family did. \"Allen, when did you get back from London?\" I asked excited to him. \"Just a few minutes ago. You were in Europe yourself. How come you didn't come to London to see me?! I'm wounded!\" Allen shouted being funny and sarcastic. As I laughed with him. \"Hear let me help you with your bags.\" Allen was kind enough to help me with the luggage when getting off the train. Allen also helped me in the carriage and hoped that I would come to the ball for next week apparently Eunice, his sister had an English suitor whom his mother hoped would soon be asking for Eunice's hand in marriage soon. There was no welcome home party when I arrived in the house. Our maid Tilly took my coat and hat as she said that my father wished to see me in his office. \"Close the door Isabella.\" As I walked into the office. I walked and sat down in the seat across from my fathers. \"I see that the investments that you made in Europe were a success for the company. However I would ask you not to work for the company you've become a problem due to the fact that you look so much like your mother. I've already had the things moved out of your office into your studio. That will be all. Please close the door when you leave. That will be all.\" Father pointed me to the door asking me to leave as the tears from eyes started to fall. When I opened the door I saw Edith carrying some paper smiling. \"Oh I see that father told you.\" She said smiling at me. \"Your things including your bedroom have been moved to the basement. The room that was yours is now mine.\" Edith said while still smiling. I ran past Edith and opened the door to the basement. When I got down there I saw that all my paintings including my things from my art studio were down here. My bedroom set was in the corner. I went to my bed laying down closing my eyes not knowing what the future held for me.[Chapter 2] 2. Painting/Meeting Thomas Sharpe Isabella's POV I was sitting in front of my father's building with my canvas painting different images that came from my mind. \"Excuse me Madam but is this the right building for Cushing Business.\" I looked up and saw a man hearing his English accent. He was wearing a dark suit that was about 17 years outdated in the line of fashion but was trying in my eyes to make a good impression. \"Yes sir you are at the correct building.\" I said smiling up at him. He was about to walk away but some of my drawings fell out of my binder I started to hurry trying to get them. The man was helpful enough get some of them of the ground for me. \"Your drawings and paintings are really beautiful. Were these drawn from life?\" The man held some of my drawings and one of my small paintings looking at them. \"Yes sir most of them are.\" I said surprised. \"Well as I have said they are quite exquisite. Are any of the small paintings for sale?\" He asked pointing at some of the same paintings that I had laid out on the sidewalk. I was shocked some people did buy paintings and some people bought my drawings over the years. But know one has ever purchased my small portraits due to them being what most people considered to be dark and eerie. \"Um yes sir they are for sale but you see sir no one has ever wanted to purchase these before.\" I said still shocked. The man picked up to small paintings the one was a young woman with tears in her eyes in a long white nightgown and other was a painting of a young child in a nursery alone. \"I wish to purchase these two from you?\" He asked holding the two paintings. \"You may sir virtue betrayal and alone darkness are $10.00 a piece. I said telling him how much the paintings were. The man gave me $20.00 smiling as put the money in my hands. I then wrapped the two paintings for him. Once the paintings were wrapped I handed them to him as he placed them in my briefcase. \"Madame, May I ask what is your name?\" He asked while picking up his bags. \"My name is Isabella Cushing. What is your name?\" I asked trying to hide my smile. \"My name is Thomas Sharpe. Are you related to Carter Cushing?\" He asked curiously. \"Yes I am one of his daughters. By the way good luck on the meeting you'll need it.\" I said trying hard not to sound harsh. \"Thank you, well good day.\" Thomas said as he tipped his hat to me. I sat up and curtsied to him. He walked away as I sat back down continuing to finish my painting.[Chapter 3] 3. Seeing Thomas Sharpe Again/The Ball Isabella's POV Father and Allen left to go to the ball that Allen's family was hosting for the Sharpe family. I had wanted to go but my father refused to let me leave the house. Allen I could tell felt bad about me not being allowed to leave he wanted me to come. After they left I sat in the living room painting something new that came out of my head after I had met Thomas Sharpe. After I was done with the sketch of what I wanted to have in this painting I started to paint it with dark colors. I then heard a knock on the front door. \"I'll get it Tilly.\" I said to our maid who was at the front door. Tilly walked to the kitchen as I opened the door seeing Thomas Sharpe. \"Hello Sir Thomas, how are you this evening?\" \"I am well miss Isabella. I was hoping to catch your father to speak with him.\" He said urgently. \"Oh well I am sorry but he has already left for the McMichael ball.\" I said replying to him quickly. \"Isabella shouldn't you be down in the basement.\" I heard Edith say as she was coming down the stairs. \"Actually Miss Isabella I was hoping that you would let me escort you to the ball. You see the McMichael's would be very upset if you didn't show up.\" Thomas held my hand telling me with his eyes for me to come with him. \"Isabella is not allowed to go to social gatherings Thomas Sharpe. I for one am allowed if you'll allow me to change I would be honored if you would escort me to the ball.\" Edith said looking at me then at Thomas. \"On the contrary I have asked Isabella to come with me not you miss Edith.\" Thomas looked at Edith with disgust. \"It would be my honor to come with you Sir Thomas.\" I said having already dressed for the ball. Thomas then took my arms in his as we left the house into his car to the McMichael's home. Alan's POV It was shame that Isabella wasn't here. My sister Eunice was not in her right frame of mind at the moment due to Sir Thomas Sharpe not being here. The doors to the ballroom opened and I saw Sir Thomas Sharpe and Isabella come in. Isabella looked stunning. She was wearing a dark navy blue dress that dropped at her shoulders. Eunice came over to me smiling. \"Well brother if I have my way you will be married to Isabella by the end of the year.\" Eunice whispered to me smiling. \"You know that I don't love Isabella not in that way, Eunice. I love Edith.\" I said quickly hoping that my sister and mother would stop saying that. Eunice then walked back over to mother who smiled when Isabella walked in. Then a few seconds later Edith walked in without an escort. She looked just as beautiful as Isabella. But she looked furious as did Mr. Cushing as Isabella walked passed her father. Isabella's POV \"Isabella, may I present my sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe.\" Thomas said looking at me and then his sister. \"Lucille, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" I said looking at her. \"As it is mine. You were gone awhile brother. Eunice was getting quite worried about you. Are you the woman who painted those two small paintings that my brother bought the other day?\" She asked looking back at me. \"Yes it was me who painted those small paintings.\" I said smiling back at her. Mrs. McMichael then said that she had an announcement to make. \"Everyone Sir Thomas Sharpe will kindly dance for us the waltz European style.\" \"The waltz requires the perfect partner.\" Thomas said things about the waltz while holding a candle in his hand. He whispered something to Eunice, she looked surprised and shocked but smiled quickly nodding her head. Thomas then came over to me as I was sitting by the piano near Lucille. \"Would you be mine?\" Thomas held his hand for me to take. I was shocked no one ever asked me to dance in a long time. \"Sir Thomas my father does not allow my sister to dance and neither do I.\" Edith came over still looking furious at me. \"Miss Edith please do not interrupt me when I am speaking to your sister. If there is a problem then I shall consort with your father.\" Thomas said looking at Edith with furious in his eyes. Thomas then looked back at me smiling still holding out his hand. I took his hand as we headed to the dance floor. \"You can close your eyes if you want Isabella.\" He said looking into my eyes. \"I don't want to close my eyes I want to keep them open.\" I said whispering to him. We danced the waltz together. I hadn't felt this happy in a long time once the dance was over my hand was entwined with Thomas he pulled me close to him again as I blew out the candle. \"Isabella would it be alright if I call on you tomorrow me and my sister would like to get to see some more of your paintings\" Thomas said as he was helping me inside Alan's car as Alan offered to take me home. I nodded saying yes as Alan started his car to drive me home. ","Summary":" {No copyright infringement intended.

Alan holds her and waits, often stroking her hair and murmuring \"shhh... it's alright...\". He can't allow himself to wonder why she cries. Sometimes, he feels as though Edith is not even in the same room. Her eyes are distant and fixed, and her hand extends towards what he can only assume is the ghostly figure of Thomas Sharpe before her. The nights she cries for her now long-gone husband are her better nights. They are the easy nights. Most nights, Edith wakes drenched in sweat, her hands clammy and gripping the sheets. Her whole body trembles and Alan would give anything to know what causes her such terror and to be able to assuage those fears. Instead, he can only wait for it to pass. When these nightmares comes, she cannot be held, cannot be soothed by his voice. He can only wait for it to pass. They have been married a year and still she cannot share a bed with him. His bed is beside hers, close enough that he can be with her in an instant. He cannot remember the last time he slept through the night. Every night, while he tries and tries to fall asleep, he is waiting. Waiting to see what sort of night she'll have. Waiting to see if he can help her or only sit idly by, powerless. As a doctor, Alan is accustomed to diagnosing a problem and fixing it. He is a healer, but Edith cannot be healed. It pains him. Since they were children, Alan had fancied her. He had always tended to all her aches and pains. He bitterly regretted ever leaving her side. London had been an adventure. It had taught him so much about the world and about himself. He had received an excellent education that had propelled his career in America. But had also forced him to sacrifice Edith. He'd made no promises when he'd left and not asked any of her. He had thought it didn't need to be said. He'd been certain the feelings were mutual. Coming back from London to a distance between them felt like a swift punch to the gut that rushed all the air from his chest. She'd changed. She'd grown up. He hadn't. And, if anything, he loved her even more. Alan felt guilty for leaving her behind to pursue his studies. In an effort to allow her some happiness of her own, he had watched her fall for the Baronet. There was something wrong with the Sharpes. Alan had known immediately, as had Mr. Cushing, but he had convinced himself it was merely jealousy painting the Sharpes in such a light. Edith was enamoured and he'd always trusted her before. He cursed himself for not trying harder. He had attended the wedding. As was the custom, the priest had asked if anyone objected. Alan still felt he should have spoken up and stopped the wedding. He never should have let her go to England. The events that transpired were his fault and his alone. His guilt keeps him up at night even while she sleeps, digging and clawing, eating him up. Edith had suffered because of horrors described in her novel still sent a chill through his entire body. He desperately hoped she had taken some artistic liberties when describing what had taken place at Allerdale Hall. But he'd done enough research into the Sharpe family history to know it was likely all true. Lucille would have killed them both if not for Thomas. He still wasn't quite sure what to think about the Baronet. In the end, Alan supposed, Thomas really did love Edith, but by then it was too late. Lucille had ruined any chance the two might have had at a happy marriage. Alan and Edith were married. He liked to think happily so. Perhaps they would be if he could have given her children, but Alan was quite certain he was impotent. It had pained him to give her the news. Edith had to content herself with Alan's companionship and no one else. He encouraged her to visit with friends but she preferred to be alone, writing. She was writing a new novel and refused to allow him to read it, no matter how he asked. \"It's too soon, I'm only on the first draft.\" she'd shyly protest. Alan knew better. Too many times, he'd glanced over her shoulder to catch the name \"Thomas\" on the page. He wondered what the subject of the piece was, that she should feel the need to hide it from him. She'd already written of their marriage. Perhaps it was a piece of fiction. Was she writing of the life she wished they'd led? He forced himself to think of other things. He hated to dwell on the matter of Edith's heart and to whom it truly belonged.[Chapter 2] Edith was, in fact, writing a piece of fiction. But only writing it in the sense that she was putting the words down to paper. The words were not hers. Had they ever truly been? Her first novel had been of the events that had happened to her, yet the Sharpes had dictated her life. If not for them, the novel would not be. Now Thomas wrote through her. She saw him frequently. No one else seemed to. Lucille had caught a glimpse of her brother's ghost, before Edith had- A shudder ran through Edith. She didn't like to think of her final days at Allerdale Hall. Her heart was tormented by the mystery of Thomas's love. She wondered if he had ever loved her or if it had been a ruse from start to finish. Her heart ached at the thought. She had loved him. She had given up everything for him, had put all her trust in him, and him alone. She knew that she should be happy now, with Alan. She ought to content herself and put Thomas out of her mind. Here was a man who truly loved her and yet she was anything but happy. How could she be? Thomas was always lurking. Sometimes in plain sight, other times she only caught a passing glance but she still knew he was still present. It seemed he was tethered to her, and had followed her back to America. On the days that he appeared to her, she would sit and listen to him talk for hours, writing down his every word. She rarely ever noticed when her husband would enter the room and watch her. Sometimes, she'd catch a whisper to one of his friends, usually something along the lines of \"my wife is not well.\" It never bothered her. She had stopped caring what society thought of her long ago. She did not attend balls or go to tea. She kept no company and that she was content with. Thomas was all the company she desired. At night, she was visited by another specter, that was always accompanied by an anguished wail she recalled all too vividly. It was the wretched howl that belonged to Lucille, the outcry that had confirmed Thomas's death. Lucille's ghost remained, to Edith's knowledge, at Allerdale. But she still came to Edith in dreams, forcing Edith to relive her final hours in the decrepit, decaying mansion. Edith had had no choice. One of them was going to die that night. Still, Lucille's death tormented her. One day, Edith looked up from her novel and, upon receiving a reassuring nod from Thomas, looked to the worried face of her husband. \"I want to return to England. To Allerdale.\" She'd been afraid to bring it up to him but she needed to see what had become of the house. She needed to see what had become of them . Alan's eyes widened and he shook his head. \"No. No, Edith. We are safe. We are happy here. Why… Why would you want to go back?\" He was almost at a loss for words. After all the horrors they had both endured, she wanted to leave their safe, quiet existence in America and return to a desolate, horrible house that held nothing but heartbreak and loss. He didn't understand. He couldn't. Edith took a pause before nodding. \"I need… closure.\" She closed her eyes, unable to look at him as tears rose to her eyes. She regretted her decision to ask him, his pain written across his face. But it was too late, she was past the point of no return. \"I never got a chance to say goodbye. After Lucille… died… we left immediately.\" \"What is there to say goodbye to?\" He knelt beside her chair, taking her hand. She opened her eyes again but they were distant, looking past him. \"Memories,\" she murmured. His eyes were fixed on her face and his stomach felt as though it had turned to stone, but he gave her a short nod. \"I will make the arrangements. It is a long trip, it will take some time.\" He hoped to convince her not to go before they were done. However, Edith wouldn't let it go. No matter how he begged and pleaded, her heart was fixed and the course was set.[Chapter 3] There was not much left of Allerdale Hall. With no inhabitants, it had fallen into even worse disrepair then when she'd left it. Local thieves had absconded with most of the furniture and anything of value. The only thing that still sat in the Great Room was the piano, Lady Sharpe still affixed to the wall and glaring down at it. The piano was, no doubt, out of tune by now, a thick layer of dust covering the keys. The moment Edith entered the ruined house a chill passed through her entire being. Memories flooded her mind and she had to close her eyes for a moment, trying to make sense of it all. Her knuckles whitened as she clenched her fists and her nails dug into her skin but she barely noticed. The wind howled through broken windows and cracked walls, and Edith could have sworn she heard it whisper her name. A shiver ran up her spine. She had insisted on coming alone, leaving Allan in their rented room. But, staring at the peeling wallpaper and clay-soaked floors, Edith wished for some company. The house was undeniably still haunted, teeming with the presence of so many tortured souls. Edith swore the house had acquired even more since she'd left. Now that she knew it was more than her imagination, Edith felt them more strongly than ever. She ached for every restless spirit trapped in the house. Edith slowly walked the halls, the hem of her skirt turning red as it trailed in the clay. There was one spirit she didn't feel following her as she explored the house. Thomas remained at her side, vigilant and silent as always. But where was Lucille? Part of Edith was relieved, they hadn't exactly parted on good terms, but the other part wondered what had become of Thomas's tortured sister. Lucille had seemed so attached to both Thomas and the house, Edith expected to see or feel her. But she wasn't there. Edith entered the attic, or at least, what was left of it. Surprisingly, Thomas's workshop was fairly intact, but the way the house creaked and groaned, she almost expected it to collapse beneath her. The door to the workshop slammed shut behind her and Edith whirled around, letting out a small yelp. There was no one there. She steadied her nerves and slowly opened the door, perring out. Still no one visible, but a new presence made itself known to her, and Edith was filled with dread to her core. Lucille was here. Edith's feet felt rooted to the floor and she struggled to take a breath. She waited for Lucille to appear, to scream, attack, to do anything. A few notes of a lullaby Edith has heard her play drifted up from the floor. But, just as quickly as her presence had come, it vanished and the music stopped. Edith felt a release. She wasted no time in returning downstairs. Thunder rumbled and the house moaned and swayed. The house sank quickly and suddenly. Red, thick clay seeped up through the floor and Edith scrambled backwards up the stairs. When the house stopped moving, the house was considerably deeper into the clay. Her shoes squished and stuck with every step to the front door. They wouldn't budge. Edith was trapped in Allerdale Hall. Edith fought the urge to panic, taking a moment to compose herself. Surely Allan would come looking for her after a while. He would rescue her. She just had to wait. Edith piled debris into the fireplace and managed to get a small fire going. She remembered, all too well, how chilly the house could get at night. As Edith lit the fireplace, she could have sworn she heard the patter or small footsteps, but, when she looked, there was no one there, human or spirit. She chalked it up to fear and her imagination. Edith hiked up her skirt, the hem of which was irreversibly dyed red, and made her way to the kitchen. She found bread and cheese, which gave her pause. They had abandoned the house over a year ago and there were no other signs of an inhabitant. She now doubted whether or not the footsteps had been real. She steeled her nerves and went in search of the source. Trudging through the clay was becoming harder and harder. Edith ditched her heels, walking barefoot. This was much easier and she resigned herself to a long bath that evening. The first floor yielded no results. She moved up a floor and, coming close to the bedroom, heard the footsteps once more, behind her. She whirled around and came face to face with a small, dirty little girl. Edith bit back a surprised shriek, swallowing it. \"Who are you?\" \"Emilie.\" Edith looked her over. The child was skin and bones, and her clothes were barely more than rags. \"Are you alone?\" The girl nodded. \"You shouldn't be here. You made her angry. You have to leave.\" Edith's blood ran cold. \"Who's angry? Do you know her name?\" \"Lucille.\" ","Summary":" There are nights she still cries for Thomas.

His neck is stiff, sore and stuck in its current position for a few moments until he manages to squint open his eyes, becoming vaguely aware of the unfamiliar surroundings. He realizes that he's woken up in a place that certainly wasn't his own bed. Scratch that, he wasn't even in a bed. Why did he feel so weird? Sitting up suddenly in alarm, his hissed at the painful sensation of cold where he certainly should not be. \"What the fuck!\" He was covered in ice. In a bathtub, covered up to his stomach in painfully cold, melting ice. His muscles ached from the combination of inactivity and the fact that whoever had placed him in here was apparently trying to slowly freeze him to death. He shivered. He looked around the room, the pink-coloured tub offset by seafoam green wall tiles, in what looked to be no top of the line motel bathroom. Where was he? He must have been exceptionally drunk (or exceptionally horny) to settle down here, of all places. A rather alarming thought came to him suddenly. Oh fucking hell, someone had cut him open, didn't they? \"Fin-ally... I was beginning to think you'd drank yourself into some kind of alcohol-induced coma. It's nearly 1.\" He jumps slightly at the voice. Who the hell was this ? He certainly didn't remember him from last night. \"Where's Tommy?\" The boy rolls his eyes. \" I have no clue who you're talking about. Is that your giggly friend from last night?\" The blonde swallows, trying to unsuccessfully move his legs and shake off the stiffness that was doing nothing to ease his hangover. He looks the figure over carefully, enough to take them in fully, he was petite and black-haired, a small bag by his feet. Whatever he drank last night with Tommy was apparently enough to send him so overboard that he'd actually gone out and picked up a whore off the street. A male whore from the looks of it. \"You don't remember me, do you? I guess you were pretty far gone by the time you decided to talk to me.\" Johnny's face expresses every horrified sentiment that he had time to think about before he even speaks. \"Oh, you've got to be kidding me... \" He looks down at himself and over his lower half, expecting to see a shoddy attempt at suturing in whatever place this little twerp had so carefully carved out one of his kidneys from. He was thankful his little organ-thief had the decency to at least keep his underwear on him. \"Do you mind telling me why I apparently picked up a black market whore? Where have you cut me?\" \"Ex-cuse me?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry what else am I supposed to call you? An escort who so happens to take a little more than just your money? Instead of the usual cash, you also take my organs? Where's a phone, I'm calling 9-11 before I bleed to death.\" He couldn't find any trace of blood for that matter, but that didn't make the situation any less serious in his alcohol-raddled brain. \"You watch too many horror movies.\" He's smiling, and Johnny is ready to leap out of the tub and throttle him. He would if he could regain feeling in his lower half. \"Do you mind explaining why the fuck I'm in ice then?\" \"Ice-water.\" He throws him a sneering glare, \"Why am I in ice- water ?\" \"You were sick.\" \"So what, you try to freeze me to death in hopes that the bacteria somehow die too?\" \"I read you're supposed to ice an injury, you hit your head and I thought you might be sick from all the alcohol, so I put you in a cool bath. The water was kinda warm, before I dumped the ice in.\" Hit his head ? Then what is the point of ice on his lower body? Johnny rolled his eyes, He wasn't the smartest one apparently. \"Where hell did you even read- you know what nevermind. What alley did I pick you up from?\" He looks incredulous. \"You didn't pick me up in an alley, for your information. Do you seriously not remember how we even met?\" \"No, I don't!\" \"Oh boy.\" \"Can you just tell me what the hell is going on?\" He regains enough mobility to finally step out of the freezing tub and sits down on the floor, grabbing a towel from the rack and covering his body in it up to his chin. He sat, on the gaudy-tiled floor, shivering violently. \"I take it you're responsible for this ,\" he gestures to the tub. \"What were you planning on doing? Giving me hypothermia for the fun?\" \"I was trying to do you a favour. You were so drunk last night that by the time we stumbled in here, you had smacked your face off the nightstand just trying to get a condom out of your wallet. Then you puked on the floor, half on me by the way, and proceeded to try and kiss me straight afterwards. It was quite the sight.\" Another thought came to his mind. \"Did we... uh, oh god-\" \"Are you kidding? You were so drunk I'd be surprised if you could get it up even if you hadn't nearly knocked yourself out. You tried though.\" It's full of snark, a tone that has Johnny more irate by the minute. \"Oh thank god.\" He looks him over again, seemingly offended by his little comment. He was dressed nicely for what he was at least, no skin-tight dress or shorts barely covering his ass, but jeans and a half-tasteful v-neck. A familiar half tasteful v-neck ... hey wait! \"You're wearing my shirt!\" \"You threw up on mine.\" Oh of course. \"How exactly did I meet you last night then?\" He didn't remember going to any red light district, nevermind actually looking for one of these things. Did he lose Tommy by then too? Where is Tommy for that matter, off passed out in another seedy motel? Or god forbid, in a holding cell because they had apparently tried to buy their way to a good time last night? His mystery hook-up takes a seat on the bathroom counter, and Johnny takes note of how small he actually is. What was he, like 100Ibs soaking wet? \"A gay bar. You walked in, eyed me, sat down on a booth with that giggly friend of yours and proceded to chuck bar peanuts at me for half an hour before you actually came up and so gallantly offered to buy me an appletini.\" After a few seconds of looking at the blonde's blank-faced stare, he continues. \"Then you asked me what my name was, if I was busy and if I'd like to come up to your hotel room. I agreed since you were cute, and well, you know the rest.\" Johnny's eyes widened. He and Tommy had walked into a gay bar, on this side of town? Fucking where ? And when had they rented a hotel? Jesus Christ, he was never gonna drink again. \"So you're not a prostitute?\" He scoffs. \"No. Do I look like one?\" He looks somewhat self-conscious and Johnny quickly regrets his words. \"No, I just uh, I just guessed I suppose.\" \"Well, I'm not. Is this how you treat all your drunken one-night stands?\" He slips down from the counter, standing there with a hand on his hip, looking Johnny over expectantly. \"No,\" He thinks for a moment. \"How about you let me make it up to you?\" There was a trance of suggestive promise in his tone. The ice water chill had left his body and he was warming up all over. He was beginning to remember why he approached him in the first place. He is cute. As weird, snarky, and demanding as he is. A brief exchange of flirtatious eye contact, and a brief deja-vu feeling settles over them in the first incidence of real coherency since meeting one another. He crosses his arms. \"Maybe. We can discuss it over breakfast, your treat of course. You have enough cash on you for a nice meal for the two of us. I guess I was your first of the night...\" He winks, and the corners of Johnny's lips curl up. \"And in the case that you probably don't remember my name, it's Daniel, for the record.\" Johnny stands up, intent on getting dressed for their apparent breakfast date. \"Well, in that case... good morning, Daniel.\" He smiles again, \"Good morning, Johnny.\" ","Summary":" Jesus Christ, what happened?

Dre arrived home and sighed happily, he was glad to be home and away from school, he had just turn 16 and had the pheromones of an un-mated omega. . Omega. . God he hated that word. . Yet that was what described Dre. . He had large brown doe eyes with a girlish figure which didn't seem to either bluff up or anything even if he trained with his new step-father, Mr. Han. He blew a long dark brown lock from his face as he hanged up his jacket on the coat hanger they had before he rushed down the hallway toward the kitchen, out of which was drifting the most tantalizing smell of the Housekeeper's cooking. When Dre entered the kitchen, he was shocked but not surprised to see his mom, Sherry cooking. He sighed but smile at seeing his mom who turn around look at him with her son with a smile at seeing him. Dre smiled even bigger at seeing her baby bump, he was super excited to be a big brother to twin girls, He was going to protect his sisters from everything and anything, \"Dre, your home early.\" Sherry said with a raised eyebrow as Dre sighed dramatically as he looked at his mom. \"Mom, don't remind me about school! It's bad enough that most of the alphas at school just look at me like I'm a piece of meat!\" He pouted with his cheeks out that made him more adorable that he intent to. Sherry giggled as Dre kept on pouting. \"Beside, you shouldn't be up from bed, Mrs. Yeoh should be making dinner not you.\" Dre then pointed out as Sherry pursed her lips although her eyes showed her guilt. \"I sent her home early today, beside I've been on bed rest for about 2 weeks now. I think I was going crazy from all the resting.\" Sherry stated as Dre sighed but he could understand his mom, she was use to doing everything and now that she was pregnant it all changed. \"Mom, your due date is about a week or so. It's better that you and my twin sisters get all the rest they need.\" Dre replied with a smile as it was Sherry's turn to pout as Dre giggled at his pouting mother before Sherry sighed happily at her eldest son. . \"I know Dre, it just it's so difficult, I mean you stepfather worries too much and it making me feel suffocated but I wouldn't changed it for anything in the world.\" Sherry said happily as Dre smiled back at his mom, he knew that at long as she was happy, he was happy. \"Mom, I may not know how you feel but I think you should talk to him, I'm sure that Mr. Han will definitely understand.\" He said with a big smile as Sherry shook her head, her son didn't understand when you are mated, you have to listen to your alpha but he will understand when he finds his special one. . \"It's not really that simple honey, but you understand and will know when you find your chosen one.\" Sherry said with a smile on her face before she clapped her hands together with a bigger smile, \"Now are you going to help me make dinner or what?\" She added as Dre chuckled and nodded happily. \"Good, You know where the potato peeler is right?\" Sherry asked as Dre once again nodded when she pointed to the piles of potatoes as Dre after retrieving the peeler from the cutlery drawer, he began to peel the potatoes. . As he was peeling the potatoes he started to think of what his mom had said. . Dre hadn't really thought of being mated off to some random stranger but now that he was 16, he knew what was going to happen. . It didn't really help that he was already in love with someone, that someone was a rival's alpha's son named Cheng, but it was a one sided love. Cheng didn't even acknowledge or even looked his way, even it Cheng liked him too it really didn't matter, since their packs would never approve of their matting. . He sighed sadly, why was love so complicated? Sherry heard her son's sad sigh and looked at him worried, \"Are you alright, honey?\" She asked as she took the sliced potatoes and began to sliced them up into small chunks. . \"Yeah mom, I think I should go and do my homework now, I have tons of math problems to do.\" Dre said with an sad tone in his voice, just thinking of his one sided love toward Cheng always made Dre sad. . Sherry looked at her son with a worried tone but she knew that he would talk to her when he was ready so she nodded with a smile. \"Alright, You can go and I will call you when Dinner's right.\" Sherry said with a knowing smile as Dre smiled at his mom, he could always count on his mom. \"Thanks, mom.\" He said with real meaning toward it, he walked out of the kitchen but he couldn't go to his room to start on his homework because he heard the doorbell ring, \"I'll get it!\" Dre yelled to his mom as he raced toward the door. He opened it thinking it was his best friend and local Beta, Harry with a big smile on his face. . Only it wasn't Harry and his smile wiped off his face as his eyes widen at seeing alpha Master Li and his son, another alpha, Chao standing on the doorsteps of Dre's door. . \"Um, Good evening. .\" He said with a confused look on his face, why were they here at Dre's home? Master Li and Mr. Han jointly owned a highly respected and highly interested dojo but it was no secret that both men despised each other with a passion. It was considered a miracle that they even manged to work together everyday in relative peace. So seeing that Master Li had showed up toward Dre's family home was a huge surprise to Dre. . \"Good Evening, May we come in?\" Master Li asked or more like demanded, but before Dre could reply, Master Li and Chao had already walked in the home as if they owned it, \"We have been invited to dinner, but perhaps we have arrived a tad early.\" Master Li informed as Dre nodded as he closed the door after them. \"Oh, of course. . \" Dre said even if he knew nothing about this Dinner invitation but he didn't want to be rude to Master Li for the sake of Mr. Han, even if Dre didn't even like the man, \"You are welcome to wait and sit in the living room, until it's time to eat, Mr. Han should be back soon and I'll go tell my mom that you are here.\" Dre said but was stopped by Master Li who shook his head. \"That won't be necessary, I will go and informed your mother of our arrival. Chao, you may stay here and keep Dre company.\" He said before he smile a cold smile that didn't reach his eyes before he left toward the kitchen. . Dre was planning to head toward his room but he knew that leaving a guest unattended was considered rude. So he barely sighed, he felt extremely awkward around Chao. Master Li was the kind of Alpha that believed that omegas were nothing more that a fuck toy, something that an alpha could have fun with and then dispose of when it was time for the alpha to find it's mate and he taught Chao to be the same way. . Dre had only see Chao around school and a few times around the Dojo, but each time he was holding different hands of omegas boys and girls. . It was know that Chao was a player but since he was an alpha not one person could say anything. . Dre paid no attention to that and knew that he didn't want to be one of Chao's conquest so he didn't even attempt to even get close to Chao. Dre then went to sit on the sofa and resolutely stared at the bonsai tree, it was Mr. Han's pride and joy beside Dre and his mother of course. It was sitting on the glass coffee table standing tall and prideful as Dre smiled at it. . His smile was wiped off his face when he noticed that Chao had sat beside him. . He tried to ignore the other boy but it was a little tough when he could feel Chao's stare when suddenly he couldn't ignored the hand that soon touched his shoulders. . Dre visibly tensed up under Chao's touch, Dre didn't move or say anything even if his brain was telling him to talk because of the suffering silence was killing him. . \"Dre, will you look at me?\" Chao's voice was soft before he added, \"Please. .\" almost like an afterthought, Dre was almost surprised to hear Chao being polite, he had heard that Chao's rudeness was legendary but hearing him say please to him was something he never thought he would hear. . He slowly looked at Chao who's darken brown eyes looked at Dre's large doe light brown eyes as Dre could have sworn that he heard a gulp from Chao, \"What do you want?\" He asked, he knew that he was being rude but could you blame Dre? \"I want to apologized. . I know that you seen me with different girls and boys and you must think I'm some player but it's what my father wanted me to. . He taught me to think that Omegas were nothing more than a pleasure toy yet I know now that can't be true whenever I see you face, Dre. . Until I met you I never had any interest in considering a omega to be my future mate. .\" Chao explained as Dre want to snorted but he held it in, it was well know that Alphas only mated with alpha female or betas, never with omegas. \"I know more about you then you think, I've been watching you constantly since you bumped into me in school. . I noticed how you always with that male beta. . \" Chao silently growled as Dre's eyes widen when he saw something flashed in his eyes. \"But you never notice me. . \" It looked like Chao want to say more but he trailed off and then he fell silent. . Dre was overwhelmed by what Chao was saying but he didn't know what to feel about Chao's confessional as he looked at Chao with a confused look on his face, \"Watching me? Chao, you sound some like some stalker. .\" Dre said Chao's face fell and he frowned sadly, \"I guess I deserved that. .\" He said sadly as Dre felt badly for him, he dint' want to sound rude but to Dre ti was kind of creepy. . \"I\"m sorry Chao, I didn't mean it like that. I was just joking. .\" Dre then looked down with a small smile and a tiny blush as he thought of Cheng, \"I'll been watching someone too. .\" When he realized what he had just said, his eyes widen as he bit his lip in worried. . It was definitely a bad, bad, idea to tell an ALPHA wolf who seemed to be obsessed with him that he had been watching someone else. . This was one of the may times Dre which he would think before he would act. . Chao's eyes flashed an eerie red for a moment, \"Watching who, Dre?\" He practically growled out as his grip on Dre's shoulders tighten. Dre flinched toward the power that Chao was showing and from the way that Chao's fingers were digging on his skin. It was really painful. \"It's doesn't matter now. . It was just a dumb crush I had but it's over now. .\" Dre lied, as he turn away from Chao's red alpha eyes as he felt Chao touched his cheeks almost like Dre was going to break at any moment. . \"Dre. . Are you sure?\" He asked as Dre looked at him to see he was staring at him with a calculating expression, Chao want to make sure that Dre wasn't lying to him, if he was, then Chao will go and fight this challenger for the right to have Dre. . Dre sighed, as if he knew what Chao was thinking answered, \"Yeah I'm sure.\" He made sure to make an effort to remain calm so Chao wouldn't suspect anything. . Yet Chao glared at him, \"Then why has your heart rate elevated?\" He demanded as Dre had to think of something and he had to think of something fast! \"Because your scaring me, Chao!\" Dre exclaimed, quickly answering because he knew that if he had hesitated then Chao would be more convinced that he was lying, \"Your eyes changed color and I thought you were going to shift and attack me!\" He said. Chao looked shock before he shook his head fiercely and to Dre's relief, he loosen the grip he had on Dre's shoulder, \"No, I would never do that to you Dre. .\" Chao said more calm then before but he still had that intensity in his eyes that really didn't suit well with his soft smile, \"Dre. . I love you more. .\" He said as Dre's eyes widen and his mouth was opened a bit in shock. . Dre was spared the anxiety of trying to reply to Chao's love confession by the arrival of Mr. Han and Master Li who passed the news that dinner was finally ready. Dre thank god silently as he quickly got up and walked by Mr. Han on the trip to the dinning room, but he could still sense that Chao was staring at him. . When everyone was sitting down on the dinner table, Dre unfortunate, ended next to Chao, which was precisely what he did not wanted. He felt like he need some space from Chao but Mr. Han and his mom was sitting on the other side and Master Li sat on the head of the table. Sherry want to serve the food but Mr. Han would have not word of it as he took charge of serving everyone's bowl of soup. There were warm bread rolls to go along with the soup and salad, Master Li had a fine glace of wine, Mr. Han and Sherry both had glasses of water and Dre and Chao had received glasses filled with soda. Although Dre was hungry and ate his food fast, the others at the table ate faster and were already on their second helping of soup when Dre had barely finished his first bowl. Except for Sherry who was only halfway through her bowl of her soup, Dre ignored the salad and ate one of the bread rolls then took a sip of his drink. Chao was in the middle of a discussion with Sherry and was thoroughly charming her, Master Li and Mr. Han were making conversation about the Dojo while subtly insulting each other. Dre was about to excuse himself when Chao suddenly took hold of his hand under the table and entwined their fingers together, for a split second Dre had imagined that it was Cheng's hand that was entwined with his as he let out a tiny blush. He snapped out of it when Chao stood up to make an announcement while still holding on to Dre's smaller hands. . \"Dad, Miss Sherry, Mr. Han I just want to say that I and Dre are dating and I'm intended on making Dre my life long mate.\" He said with a smile toward Dre who was frozen with shock, unable to take in what Chao had said but he was the only one that was surprised. . Mr. Han and Sherry congratulated him and Dre, even Master Li although he did have a sour face on but you could tell he was happy for his son. Sherry seemed unable to contained her tears as she held on to Dre and then to Chao. \"I'm so proud of you honey! You found you chosen mate!\" Sherry said happily, she had mistaken her son's shocked face for a happy one when it was the opposite. . Mr. Han held Dre and then shook Chao's hand, \"You better take good care of my Dre.\" He said as Chao nodded toward Mr. Han with a promise that he will take real good care of Dre. After that, The Li family said their goodbyes while Dre was still in a state of shock and even more when Chao kissed his cheek to bid a goodbye and good's night rest. The Li Family then left and Dre was finally able to be excused, he briefly said goodnight to Sherry and Mr. Han before went upstairs to his room, feeling numb. . Once in his room, he climbed in his bed and just sobbed onto his pillow. . He didn't care that he had homework. . He didn't care that he still had his school uniform on. . He stopped caring when Chao announced that Dre would be his mate. . Dre didn't have a choice. . He sobbed even more knowing that he would never be able to see or look at Cheng again. . Love was so complicated. .

This hadn't been his idea, he would rather have been back at the dojo or his place rather than seated with the enemy. \"She should be here any minute now, Amanda is usually pretty punctual…\" He finally looked up to meet Daniel's gaze. Amanda had been the mastermind behind this little meeting. He wasn't sure why she was so obsessed with trying to solve an age old dispute, but for some reason she wouldn't let it be. This wasn't the first time Amanda had orchestrated getting the two of them together. Honestly, in the end that day hadn't been half bad. LaRusso's taste in music was surprisingly alright and it was rather odd the way they had bonded over their adolescent father figures. All of that had been for nothing though as any semblance of getting along had been dashed with all the business about Robby and the All Valley Tournament. Daniel's cellphone chimed and he looked down, sighing he put the phone down on the table, rolling his eyes. \"Apparently there is an emergency at the dealership. Not enough of an emergency to need me there, but too much for Amanda to get away.\" Johnny couldn't help a snicker as it slipped from his lips. They had both been played by his wife. \"So we having dinner or what?\" Daniel gave an annoyed grunt before finally relenting. \"Yeah sure, but wouldn't you rather someplace nicer?\" he motioned to the pub around them. \"Actually no. Amanda let me pick the place, this is one of my favorites.\" Muttering under his breath Daniel picked up the laminated menu. \"Is there anything on here that isn't deep fried? I feel like I'm having a heart attack just reading this!\" \"My god, can you just chill? This place has the best wings in town hands down. And their burgers are great. Sorry it's not all lobster and caviar like you're used to.\" The blonde smirked. \"I don't even like caviar,\" Daniel shot back though he could tell it wasn't much of a comeback by the others smirk. \"So if you're done sulking, mind if we order some food?\" Johnny motioned for the waitress and she made her way to their table flashing a smile as she asked for their orders. \"Coors banquet for me, dirty martini ice ice cold for that one,\" he motioned to Daniel, \"And we'll start with two pounds of the suicide wings and a couple of the house burgers with fries, gravy on the side.\" Daniel gave him the stink eye as the waitress walked off, \"I can order for myself you know.\" The brunette was impressed though that Johnny had remembered his drink of choice. He had to admit, Johnny was far more perceptive than he gave him credit for. \"You seemed to be having trouble with the menu so I thought I'd help you out a little,\" Johnny gave him a stupid grin. \"Besides, if I'd have left it up to you, you'd have ordered some pussy wings or something. It's suicide or nothing here, maybe you'll finally get some hair on your balls.\" Daniel's mouth opened in protest but he closed it almost just as quickly, trying to keep his temper in check. If he was telling Robby to find peace and balance he might as well practice what he preached. \"What, no witty remark?\" their drinks had arrived and Johnny raised the bottle to his lips for a swig. \"I just don't feel the need to stoop to your level John.\" Daniel raised his glass in a mock toast before taking a sip, his eyes closing as he gave a happy hum. \"That, is a damn good martini.\" Johnny just gave a smug smile, \"I told you this place was good.\" They continued with the banter until the food arrived, Johnny ordering another round of drinks. \"Alright, you ready for this?\" Johnny smiled as he watched Daniel take a piece of Chicken with his fingers, himself grabbing a wing as he took a bite. Spice flooded his mouth as he felt the kick of the hot sauce. It was strong, that was for sure, but he was accustomed to the heat. LaRusso on the other hand looked like he was about to cry. \"Can't handle the heat, Danielle ?\" Daniel gasped for air, grabbing for his drink as he gulped it down. \"I feel like my face is melting!\" Johnny laughed, signalling their server that she should bring some water to the table as well. \"So I guess I'm eating two pounds of wings huh? I mean if you're not man enough to finish them.\" Tears were welling in his eyes but there was no way he would let himself be bested by Johnny Lawrence. \"Back off, these are mine, I'll finish them!\" Daniel looked at his plate. One wing down, nine more to go. This is what hell was like, he was in hell. Seated across from his enemy eating something he thought was going to burn through his intestines, really hell could be the only explanation. By the fifth wing, tears were streaming down his face. \"You crying LaRusso?\" Johnny was laughing as he licked his fingers, watching the other suffer. Daniel gulped at his water, \"I'm not crying, I just can't stop my face from doing anything. I can barely feel it anymore!\" Next to arrive was the burgers, along with round three of drinks. \"You don't have to finish the wings Danny boy, you've got nothing to prove.\" Johnny dropped his last bone to his plate, reaching across and grabbing one of the three remaining pieces from Daniel's. Daniel tried to swat away Johnny's hand but missed, the other man easily stealing his food. He shrugged, moving the plate away from him, Johnny was right. He really had nothing to prove and the hot sauce was killing him. He grabbed a package of wetnaps and cleaned his fingers before eyeing the burger in front of him. \"Well, it's not going to eat itself…\" Johnny motioned to the burger as he finished off the last of the others wings. Daniel took the burger into his hands, trying to flatten it slightly as he wasn't sure it was going to fit into his mouth. He took his first bite, eyes widening in surprise. \"Hey, this is actually amazing…\" Johnny laughed, \"I fucking told you.\" Conversation waned as they ate, their waitress keeping the drinks flowing. \"If I'd have known he was trying to date your daughter, I would have let him go with that lame ass date idea he had.\" \"Wait, what the hell did you have to do with your student dating my daughter?\" Daniel pointed at the other, his eyes started to glaze over from the alcohol. \"It wasn't by choice,\" he was grinning as he finished off yet another bottle of beer, \"I told him to go to Golf 'N Stuff too, classic date…\" \"Wait… you took your dates to Golf 'N Stuff?\" Daniel's words were starting to slur a little as he spoke. \"Duh. Everyone knew that was the place to hook up.\" There was a lull as both men thought for a moment. \"Ali and I went there on our first date.\" Daniel's voice was thoughtful as he spoke. Johnny scoffed, rolling his eyes. \"I took her there first.\" \"Not everything is a competition Johnny,\" Daniel wagged his finger as he spoke. \"No, but if it were I would have kicked your ass. I was damn good at the arcade back in the day. Mini golf too.\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yeah…\" Both men were leaning in on the table, staring the other down. \"This is happening.\" Johnny motioned for the cheque, looking at Daniel as it arrived. \"Your wife started this whole thing. You're paying.\" Begrudgingly the brunette pulled out his wallet, paying for the meals and plethora of drinks. As they stood to leave he stumbled slightly, Johnny catching him and walking beside him as they made their way out of the pub. \"Someone doesn't hold his liquor well.\" \"Or it could also be that I'm not perpetually drunk.\" Johnny shook his head, \"Whatever LaRusso, I'm driving. There is no way I'd let you behind the wheel.\" Daniel raised an eyebrow, \"And I should trust you?\" \"I'm not the one tripping over my own two feet. Come on, you chicken?\" \"I've beat you at mini golf, the race track and a shit ton of arcade games. I think it's easy to know who the champion is tonight.\" \"No!\" Daniel protested, \"I beat you on street fighter twice in a row!\" \"One videogame doesn't cancel all of the rest of my wins.\" Johnny smirked. They were making their way back to the charger, the blonde fishing the keys from his pocket. \"So, taking you back to your car?\" Daniel shook his head, \"No. Just take me home. Amanda can take me out to pick up my car in the morning. I think the martinis are catching up with me.\" The drive went rather smoothly, singing along to the classic rock playing on the radio. It really was shocking how similar their interests in music seemed to be. Soon they were pulling up in the large driveway of the LaRusso residence. Johnny cut the engine as they stopped, opening his door at the same time as Daniel. \"I do know the way to my own door. You don't have to walk me.\" Daniel said in a dry voice. \"True,\" Johnny grinned, \"But can you walk a straight line?\" \"Ha, ha.\" Johnny shrugged, \"I'm just saying, I've had to catch you a couple of times tonight.\" Daniel bumped his shoulder against the others as they walked, \"You know, if I'd have been sober the score would have been a lot different!\" \"Excuses Danielle , excuses.\" Johnny smiled, amused and somewhat endeared by how miserable Daniel was acting about all of this. They stopped near the pool, eyes meeting as they stood in silence. Neither really knew what to say. It wasn't like they were friends, exactly how did you part from someone that wasn't really a friend? \"Say hi to Amanda. I hope her emergency worked out.\" Daniel nodded, subconsciously taking a step closer as they talked. \"Yeah, I'll tell her. Thanks for the ride home.\" \"Least I can do after you gave me the car and all…\" He swallowed hard, as they leaned into one another. It was hard to know who made the first move, their lips brushing briefly but neither pulled away. Daniel's hand cupping the blonde's cheek as he stepped closer, their lips meeting once more but this time with more pressure. One kiss led to another, until Johnny finally pulled away with a smirk. \"I told you Golf 'N Stuff was the place to go for hooking up.\" Daniel rolled his eyes, wiping his lips with the back of his hand. \"Go home Johnny.\" \"Gladly.\" Johnny turned to leave, grinning for ear to ear. Maybe the night hadn't turned out how either of them had planned, but maybe that was for the best.

This hadn"},{"Movie":"Karate Kid","Title":"The Sleepover","Author":"Rynn-Sama","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12965370","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The brunette drummed his fingers as he looked at the clock. His new friend would be here any moment now. Honestly? He was terrified. He didn't usually have friends over to his place and that was mostly due to the fact that he always saw them at school, karate, or when they went out. Rarely did they ever congregate at someone's house other than to meet up and leave for the real destination. Johnny had asked to come over though, that was a first. When the blonde had suggested the sleepover for that weekend, Bobby had just automatically assumed it would be hosted by the boy. Johnny had seemed nervous, sheepish really, as he quietly asked if they could do it at Bobby's house. Bobby had been embarrassed at first, wondering if it was some joke. Everyone knew where Johnny lived and that his step dad was loaded. Not that the Brown's were destitute, far from it. They just lived a more modest lifestyle, without having to flaunt their wealth. Wouldn't it have been a more enjoyable weekend with the larger house and plethora of toys that Johnny had at his disposal? Then there was also the fact that Johnny would get a glimpse into sides of Bobby that he didn't always let shine at school or karate. It was anything secret, he just seemed to have interests that differed from the other boys at the dojo. Dutch gave him a hard enough time as it was, he wasn't sure if this would just add fuel to the fire. Thankfully Dutch wouldn't be there. He would just have to wait and see if Johnny would make fun of him or not. The doorbell rang and Bobby jumped to his feet, scrambling to the door. As he opened it he grinned widely at Johnny, his overnight bag in tow. \"Thanks again for asking your parents if I could spend the night here. My step dad isn't a fan of noise, especially at night.\" Johnny explained as he made his way into the Brown's home. So that explained it he thought to himself. Bobby gave a chuckle. Johnny's step dad did seem to be a little bit older than his mom and Bobby's parents. It was probably an old person thing. \"Yeah, it's cool. My parents don't mind at all. My mom said we could order pizza tonight and she picked up some extra snacks and some soda for us too.\" They stood in awkward silence for a moment in the foyer. Bobby wasn't entirely sure what to suggest they do and Johnny not comfortable taking charge the first time in Bobby's home. When the lull was finally broken it was the blonde who spoke first. \"So… where should I put my stuff?\" Bobby blushed, embarrassed that he hadn't thought of that before the boy had spoken. \"Oh yeah, just up in my room. My dad set up blankets and things in the den downstairs so we can sleep there. It'll probably best to keep your stuff in my room so my sister doesn't get into it. She can be annoying like that.\" Bobby led the way up the stairs and down the hall to his room. \"That one is my parents and this is my sisters. The bathroom is at the end of the hall if you need it. And this is mine…\" The door swung open and Bobby allowed Johnny to enter first, the duffle dropping to the ground with a thud. \"It's not much…\" Bobby started before Johnny cut him off. \"Nah, it's pretty cool,\" Johnny said as he looked around the room with wide exploring eyes. He watched as Johnny took in his surroundings, trying to gauge his reaction. Bobby knew his room had to be different from that of most other boys his age. It had all started a couple years back when he had seen a movie that had changed his life. Sure, growing up Bobby had enjoyed some of the things his peers would deem nerdy, but at that time he was young enough for it not to matter. He had just continued to like those kinds of things as he got older. It wasn't really a shock that Star Wars had captured his imagination when it had come out. His room proudly displayed his collection of prized figures, models and posters adoring the walls. \"So you're into that whole space thing I guess?\" Johnny asked after he had taken it all in. \"Yeah… outside of school and karate I'm pretty into fiction and fantasy I guess... Science fiction in particular,\" The brunette fidgeted as he feigned a smile. Did Johnny think he was a dork? \"I think I saw that movie once,\" Johnny said pointing to one of the posters on the wall, \"It was okay.\" Bobby met Johnny's eye. He couldn't tell if the boy was telling the truth or just lying to make him feel better. They smiled at each other. Sure, it might not be Johnny's thing but he didn't feel any judgement from his new friend. A warmth spread through his chest, the same way he had felt it on the Ferris wheel the first day they had met. Dutch had been torturing him, but Johnny had tried to comfort and calm him. A favor that he would never forget. Johnny tried to be macho and show off with the other guys, trying to fit in, but how was that really any different than what Bobby himself was doing? Bobby hid his hobbies to fit in, and though he didn't always partake in some of the more questionable activities his fellow Cobra Kai's partook in, he did stand by and watch without much of a word. He never held it against Johnny for trying to fit in. \"Oh I get it now…\" Johnny said, breaking Bobby from his thoughts. \"Get what?\" the brunette asked, confusion laced in his voice. \"Your hair,\" Johnny gave a small chuckle, \"It looks exactly like that guy in your movie poster.\" He turned to look at the picture behind him, coming face to face with Luke Skywalker. Bobby's cheeks tinted pink. He would never admit it, though Johnny did have a point. Luke was a bit of a idol for him, who didn't want to grow up to be a Jedi? He also realized Johnny had been lying about having seen Star Wars . There is no way you would call Luke Skywalker that guy if you had actually seen it. He chuckled a little as he punched Johnny playfully in the arm. The doorbell rang and his face lit up. \"That must be the pizza! Come on, we should get some and then we can maybe play some games or watch movies.\" He grabbed Johnny's hand, pulling him along as they rushed down stairs. He grabbed the pizza box with a quick kiss to his mother's cheek, calling out a thank you as he led the way into the den. The hours passed easily as they talked and goofed off, pizza and treats being consumed. Bobby was relieved to find that even though Johnny did not seem to share his interest in science fiction, they did have many similar interests. It didn't take long for the conversation to turn to karate, Johnny's eyes lighting up as he talked excitedly about how amazing it was to have joined the class. They practiced a few punches before moving onto kicks. The kicks proved to be a little more on the difficult side with the uneven carpet along with blankets and pillows littering the floor. \"It looks more like this,\" Bobby explained as he attempted a kick but lost his balance. He yelped out as he fell into a bowl of potato chips, scattering them across the floor. The commotion had caused his mother to check in on them, chiding Bobby as she reminded him that there was no karate in the house. \"Wanna watch a movie? It's getting late and we should probably keep it down.\" Bobby shrugged, taking a handful of chips from the floor, the bowl between them now rather empty. \"Sure, sounds fun! What do you have?\" Johnny smiled, reaching for the chips as well, though he opted for those still in the bowl. Bobby's eyes lit up, \"Well, I just rented Superman earlier this week! Have you seen it? It's great!\" The blonde's smile wavered for a moment before being force again. \"No, I haven't seen it. We could watch it?\" Bobby paused, studying his guests face. \"Are you sure? We don't have to.\" \"Yes, I'm sure.\" Bobby hesitated before putting on the movie. For the first half Johnny peppered him with questions which he honestly didn't mind answering. He had seen it before anyways so it was easy to explain the plot to the other as it went along. As Johnny quieted, Bobby continued to watch with fascination, drawn in until the last second. \"So what did you think?\" He asked eagerly, turning towards the boy. What he found was the other breathing steadily, eyes closed as he peacefully slept. Bobby couldn't help the chuckle that passed through his lips. Johnny hadn't seemed particularly enthused about the movie to begin with so it wasn't really surprising. Quietly he moved to clean up the snacks and drinks around them before he settled in beside the other. Gently he pulled the blankets up around Johnny's body, tucking him in so to speak. \"Sweet dreams Johnny,\" Bobby smiled, closing his eyes as he allowed himself to drift off as well.

I needed some breathing space from my other story, and this strange little one-shot happened. Thank you all for your wonderful feedback on Empty Orchestra. May 20, 2018 12:03 am The All-Valley trophy loomed over him at the desk where he was slumped forward, over a bitter drink. It might as well have been the taxidermy bust of his son, the boy's eyes glassy and stunned. It seemed like every time Johnny held the trophy, he involuntarily walked with a limp. Johnny swirled the Jim Beam in his glass. His face was flushed and tight. Tonight was a night to get so drunk that he'd piss in the crisper drawer of the fridge, thinking it was the toilet. It was a night to remember the good times with Shannon Keene, how hard he'd grip the headboard rungs after she'd had rich desserts. The florescent lights in the office were dimming and green- that was why the light shining in the window suddenly seemed so obnoxious. \"The hell…?\" He went out the back entrance into the alley, and saw that something- at this odd hour- was open across the street on Vanowen. Valhalla Video, said the lit-up awning. Johnny could swear that the building had been boarded up a week ago, but there it was. He hadn't seen a video store in years, even in Reseda, where things always trudged a little behind. He walked through the door as an electronic chime rang out. The place had red carpeting and shelves and shelves of thick VHS tapes. It was analog heaven. He knew he wasn't drunk enough to be seeing full-on hallucinations. He felt like a wide-eyed kid standing under a giant snake sign again. Billy Squier's \"Catch 22\" was playing on the radio. There was popcorn and candy at the register, and the M&M;'s had a picture on the box with tan ones in the mix. Where the fuck did they even get those? Could you eat candy that was twice as old as your students? A kid popped up from behind the counter, who looked as familiar as everything else here. \"Hellacious evening, bro'. Let me know if you need any help.\" \"So is this like…the 80's diner from Back To The Future II, or what?\" Johnny mused. That movie hadn't been too far off about the future. There were hover-boards, although they had giant wheels and often burst into flames. He remembered Shannon's lament a few years ago: \"I can't pay for one of those hover-boards by myself. Please give me half, he wants one so bad. Johnny, I'm begging.\" \"Just ge t him a damn skateboard, Shan.\" The guy at the register hadn't answered. Johnny cleared his throat. \"I never noticed this place before.\" \"We're a hidden gem.\" \"I bet it's gonna get overrun by poindexters, like places that sell vinyl.\" \"Nah, we have a pretty specific base.\" \"You got a, um…behind-the-curtain section, bud?\" \"You know it. There's someone back there already.\" \"If it's a chick, I'll know this place isn't real.\" Johnny slipped past the red curtain and there was a wispy-haired old man in there, with his back turned. The man sighed loudly at the stacks of videotapes next to him. He put one into the clunky rewinder and pushed the button. Johnny laughed to himself, thinking like his students: \"the struggle is real.\" He wasn't amused for long when he noticed there was nothing on the shelves. \"Uh, 'scuse me?\" Johnny said. \"You all out of porn, or what?\" \"Must make better selection.\" \"I knew there was something weird about this place.\" \" Hai . But can't beat service.\" He turned around in that slow way begged for a sting of music- the twang of a koto. You didn't forget a man who flung you over his shoulder and chopped you straight down the middle of your stark white ribcage. For a moment, Johnny forgot the guy's name. Yamasaki, Hayashi? The only thing that stuck out was that LaRusso had talked about him in the past tense. \" ...flaming shits...?\" was all Johnny could say. He clutched his swirling head, wondering how much this had to do with the Jim Beam. \"You're not one of those Japanese ghosts who's gonna crawl across the floor and kill me, are you?\" \"Have many power, still bad at killing. Miyagi have unfinish business here.\" \"W-what do you want from me, man? Is this because I never thanked you in the parking lot? OK, OK- thank you, guy who attacked me, for saving my ass when another guy attacked me. Thanks for being five percent less crazy than him, alright?\" \"Cannot accept. Miyagi not finish saving boy. If Miyagi reached out hand to you…maybe everything different.\" \"Yeah, well, I didn't need your pity then, and I don't need it now,\" Johnny said, and stormed through the red curtain. When he came out on the other side, Miyagi was in front of him. \" Hijo de puta?! \" Johnny gasped, not realizing he'd picked up Spanish curses, or why they had come out before his fists even went up. Johnny blinked and Miyagi was behind him again. \"Best block, no be there.\" He tapped Johnny's goose-fleshed shoulder with a VHS tape, which the younger man jerkily accepted. \"What's this, five hours of kata I have to watch with my eyes clamped open?\" Johnny swallowed. \"No. Not Iron Eagle, either. Boy choose. Put tape in machine, choose one day. Live day again. Which one, up to you. Wake up 2018, see what happen. Choose.\" \"There are no do-overs.\" \"Choose,\" Miyagi repeated. Johnny looked down at the tape and when he looked up again, the old man was gone. Also gone was the counter boy Johnny had finally placed: the memorial page from the '83 yearbook. Everything was yellowing and he could swear he saw tracking lines across his vision. Johnny ran out the door, but the electronic chime didn't sound. He didn't look back at Valhalla until he was almost at the rear entrance of the dojo. When he did, all he saw was a run-down storefront with plywood over the windows, and the night air swept his lungs. Miguel knew it was urgent when Sensei called him after midnight. He slammed his bike to the sidewalk at the strip mall and blasted through the dojo door, the tingling bell going crazy. Miguel sat on the desk in the office as Johnny paced back and forth, trying his best to retell his Twilight Zone story. Miguel had many questions right off the bat, but after \"LaRusso's dead sensei's ghost,\" \"stopped Kreese from strangling me,\" \"he wants to make things right,\" and \"the store disappeared,\" the kid didn't know where to start. He knows his teacher would never lie about something like this, and the amount of alcohol you'd have to consume to have such a vision would probably kill you. Miguel eyed the All-Valley trophy, the sheer height of it. If he could win that, he could believe anything. \"So…how…do you pick the day to do over when you put the 8-track in?\" Miguel asked. \"Videotape, dipshit. Maybe I close my eyes and make a wish like a ten-year old girl- how the fuck do I know? This is probably some weird Santería curse your mom put on me or something.\" \"Why would she do that? She's a hundred percent converted to the way of the fist- couldn't you tell at the tournament?\" Johnny thought of Carmen's radiant face and swallowed bourbon reflux. \"...Wai-wai-wait. Sensei. Shit, I know your do-over! Senior year All-Valley, dude!\" \"Wow, I never would've thought of that on my own, Chappy. What would I do without you?\" Johnny flouted. \"Hey, you're the one who called me over here in a panic.\" \"I wanted to make sure I wasn't dead, not have a slumber party to paint our nails and chat about what day I'm gonna pick.\" \"Hear me out, OK? You do the tournament over, you zig instead of zag-\" \"Who am I, Snoopy dancing on top of a little fucking piano?\" \"You take the last point, you wake up in 2018 and ¡Ya está! Maybe everything changes for the better, a-and maybe LaRusso is strung out behind the strip eating burritos.\" \"Yeah, and where does that leave your little she-wolf you'd take back in a second?\" The boy wanted to furrow his brow and cluck in dismissal, but he bit the inside of his mouth and went soft. \"Shit,\" he sighed. \"OK, so maybe that would have too big a ripple effect,\" Miguel said. \"Alright, let's see…what else do you regret?\" It was the simplest question, but the bitter ocean unleashed in Johnny filled him to his gold hair. \"How long you got?\" Miguel spent over an hour writing things on the dry erase board in the office. Possible do-overs, their possible ripple effects. Lines upon lines stemming out like tournament brackets. Question marks, bad doodles. Johnny knew the days that stuck in his throat the most. They all had to do with Robby, but he wasn't ready to tell Miguel about him. One day wasn't enough to fix things with Robby, anyhow. \"OK,\" Miguel said, tapping a marker against his palm. \"You don't go drunk-driving to the sports arena that night, the Firebird doesn't get totaled…\" \"I never get pissed off enough to re-open Cobra Kai. That's out.\" \"What if you go back to the summer of 1984 and never start that fight with your girlfriend?\" Miguel proposed, scrawling away in red. \"Oh, you automatically assume I started it?\" He did, but anyway. \"Whatever. You can thank me when you wake up married to Ali.\" Johnny remembered the force of those hellcat hands against his chest, and wasn't sure if that was a good thing. His mind drifted as Diaz continued to blather and go Bloodhound Gang on the board. \"Cut stepdad's brake lines\" seemed promising, but...as much as it filled Johnny's throat with bile, Sid had truly loved his mother- the geezer never missed a chance to offer too much information about just how much. Besides...the color had once drained from Johnny's face at the thought of breaking someone's leg, never mind killing someone. He could go back to that night in Shannon's bed, when he was strangely moved by her expression as she watched him. He could stop the three words from slipping out, because that had really complicated things...and...led to her throwing her birth control pills away. He cleared his throat, thinking of the rare green of his son's eyes. Maybe his do-over didn't have to change anything at all. Maybe he could just re-live a day with his mother and feel her long, wavy hair falling all around his shoulders, and smell that green perfume…Emeraude, that was it. To put your grown-up brain in your clueless kid body- wasn't that everybody's dream? He could really absorb it all, knowing what he knew now. He and Mom could ride go-carts and buy penny candy, and change the ending of Blueberries for Sal to \"She decided to live with the bears.\" And when Sid chuckled, \"That mop of hair makes you look like Sal,\" Johnny might still storm off- maybe even more so with his grown-up brain- and maybe walk into the path of a giant station wagon. Who would be erased from the Valley? Who would be slouched in a corner, who would never find a channel for their anger? \"Diaz…you should go home. I'm not even gonna play around with this shit.\" \"What if you have to, though? If you don't play the tape, Miyagi might keep trolling you. It seems like you have to enter his realm voluntarily, so he'll keep luring you into obsolete establishments until you comply. Next could be some undead disco, or-\" \"Diaz, shut the fuck up, alright? I can't do this anymore, I feel like I'm gonna hurl.\" \"…Hurl what, exactly?\" \"Look, man,\" Johnny groaned. \"Ninety-nine percent of these scenarios probably end with us never meeting, and you still being a wheezing gherkin. I…I can take one for the team and just let things be.\" \"You would do that, for me?\" Miguel said quietly. \"Hell, yeah. And who knows...rip a page in a library book in 1973, and Bernie Sanders ends up being president or something.\" \"That would actually be…yeah, never mind.\" Miguel was more verklempt than ever in the beat that followed. \"Dude, you…you have a magic fucking tape that can change the past, and…you're not gonna use it, for a kid who mostly annoys the shit out of you?\" \"For all you annoying pricks,\" Johnny said. Johnny fell asleep at his apartment with his face smashed so hard into the pillow, it rearranged his nose for most of the morning. \"Never drinking Jim Beam again, \" he groaned. He was covered in sweat and realized the A/C unit in the wall was busted. HVAC shit was out of his expertise, so he called the maintenance guy and left a voicemail. Never got a call back, so he went to find him. He opened the screen door and saw him sitting with his back turned. \"Oh, hiding out, huh? I should make you do a shot of my ball sweat. When the hell are you gonna fix my A/C?\" \"Afterlife,\" the man chuckled. \"Motherfuc-\" Johnny jumped as Miyagi turned around. \"Just drag me to hell already...\" \"Hah-hah! No such place, besides here. And bottom whiskey bottle.\" He couldn't argue with that. \"...yeah...pretty much everywhere except that video store.\" \"I know you'd like. And you make better selection.\" \"You sure about that, 'cause it feels like I'm in my boxer shorts talking to LaRusso's undead babysitter.\" The old man laughed heartily. \"Miyagi made mistake not to take Johnny-san under wing, but boy still fly. Best way to fix past, not be there. Johnny-san care more about others' future. Miyagi done here.\" The old man walked to the screen door as Johnny felt sand in his eyes. \"...You sure you weren't the crazier sensei?\" \"Very sure. Breathe, Johnny-san. No snake around throat anymore.\" He wanted to ask Miyagi one more thing before he vanished- if he could re-open the video store, because he felt there was a niche in Reseda for it. Instead, Johnny closed his eyes and felt the reels inside him filling to completion. THE END ","Summary":" A/N : Hey, guys!

It has been readjusted to fit the Karate Kid world as depicted in the YouTube Red television series Cobra Kai (and to serve as a prequel to my 30 Worlds: Royal Megaforce stories set after Season One of Cobra Kai ) but is largely the same story as it was written back then. Unaligned World of Cobra Kai LaRusso Auto Group Dealership Reseda, California USA November 15th, 2011 It was a day like most others in the life of Daniel LaRusso. He had a business that was doing well, a family who loved him, and he them. And it was all because of one man...a man Daniel was about to lose forever. There was a knock on Daniel's office door. An employee came in, a concerned expression on his face. \"Mr. LaRusso, your wife is on Line 3. She sounds upset,\" he said. Daniel nodded his thanks, then picked up the phone handset on his desk and dialed the extension. \"Hello?\" Daniel asked. \" It's Amanda, \" the voice of Daniel's wife, Amanda, said. \" I just got a phone call from the Army. Mr. Miyagi is dead. \" Daniel sat silently for a moment, then looked at a newspaper clipping in a frame on his desk. It was headlined \"Mystery Dojo with Single Student Defangs Cobras.\" \"I'll be right there,\" Daniel said before hanging up. He then pulled a piece of paper from his notebook and wrote some words on it. \"Everyone, go home,\" Daniel said. \"I have to close up early today. Family emergency.\" As the employees and customers left the dealership, Daniel taped the message to a door. It read: \"This dealership is closed today due to a family emergency. Please visit one of our other dealerships if you wish to shop.\" Halfway across the country in West Newbury, Massachusetts, Julie Pierce woke up in her apartment to a beeping from the phone on her bedside table. Unlocking it, she received a message from one of her Facebook friends. You know that karate teacher you told me about, Nariyoshi Miyagi? Well, I read on the website for the Reseda Times newspaper in California that he died last night at a V.A. hospital in Arizona. His body is being brought back to Reseda for full military burial. You should be there. A couple of weeks later, at Mr. Miyagi's old home, Daniel led a memorial wake for Miyagi. Friends and family of both Daniel and Mr. Miyagi gave their condolences. Finally, at the end of the line, stood Julie. \"Excuse me,\" Julie asked Daniel. \"Can you tell me where I may find Daniel LaRusso?\" \"You're looking at him,\" Daniel said. \"You must be Julie Pierce.\" Julie nodded. \"Mr. Miyagi told me a lot about you,\" she said. \"And me of you,\" Daniel said. \"I pictured you a little taller,\" Julie said. \"That's what my wife said when she met me,\" Daniel said, gesturing to Amanda. \"When Mr. Miyagi taught you, what was the craziest chore he had you do to teach you karate?\" \"Well, one time, he taught me how to waltz under the cover of teaching me a new kata ,\" Julie said. \"And you?\" Daniel closed his eyes as he remembered. \"Wax on, wax off,\" he said in a whisper. Julie smiled. She too was admonished, \"Wax on, wax off\" during her training. \"I'm gonna miss him,\" Daniel said as he looked at a bonsai tree on the table they stood next to. \"Me too,\" Julie said. \"Mr. Miyagi was one in a million.\" Their eyes then were drawn to an American flag on the mantle, folded in a triangle, customary for American servicemen who have died. A brass plaque attached to the frame read: SGT. NORIYOSHI MIYAGI UNITED STATES ARMY 1925-2011 Gone but not forgotten…. \"Listen, Julie, thanks for your being here today,\" Daniel said. \"I'm sure that Mr. Miyagi would have been happy to have you here to help celebrate his life. He sure changed mine.\" \"Mine too,\" Julie said. \"Mine too.\" Seven Years Later As the sun rose over Reseda, Daniel made his daily visit to the grave of Mr. Miyagi. Daniel promised Miyagi's spirit that he would use Miyagi's teachings to bring an end to the threat of the Cobra Kai dojo once and for all. Bowing to Miyagi's gravestone, Daniel set out for the flagship car retailer that bore his name. Robby Keene, Daniel's top student, greeted Daniel as he walked in the door. \"Good morning, Sensei ,\" Robby said. \"Robby, here you can call me Daniel or Mr. LaRusso, but not Sensei. Is that clear?\" \"Yes, Mr. LaRusso,\" Robby said. Daniel gestured for Robby to get to the repair department to do some polishing. As Daniel walked through the dealership, checking the various employees' work. \"But, Sofia, we need a new land vehicle,\" a man looking at a Jeep Grand Cherokee said. \"After all, the last one we had was destroyed when Basco took out Gavan's Glory in the Unaligned World of Fire Emblem.\" Daniel didn't hear a response to the man's cryptic words. \" He must be talking on a Bluetooth headset to one of those LARPers I've heard about ,\" Daniel thought. Nevertheless, Daniel walked up to the man. \"I see you've got good taste,\" Daniel said to the man. \"Got one just like it at home.\" As Daniel talked to the mysterious customer, he had no idea that—just like his life had been changed by the late Nariyoshi Miyagi 34 years before—his life was about to change forever...all because of a customer looking at a silver Jeep...a customer he would come to know as King William of Cinnabar.

Daniel couldn't help but chuckle, \"Whatever you say, King Karate .\" It may have been something he had said on a whim back in high school but for some reason it had always stuck in his mind. Besides Johnny had lots of endearing names for him, it was only fair that he had a few of his own. Walking over to the couch be handed the blonde a glass of water with a pill, \"Here's a Robaxin. I'll keep looking for that dual use ointment.\" \"I'll be fine, I just need to rest a little.\" Johnny said before taking the pill, swallowing it with a gulp of water. He inhaled sharply as a stab of pain shot up his back. \"What you need is a chiropractor!\" Daniel called out from somewhere in the house as he continued his search for the medicated cream. \"Ha! That's a good one!\" Johnny yelled back sarcastically. \"Especially coming from the guy with a gold star health plan.\" Daniel returned to the living room, the bottle of Rub-A535 in hand. \"I'm serious John, an injury like this at your age could lead to bigger problems. Don't ignore it.\" Blue eyes rolled at the other, \" At my age ? God LaRusso, you're only a year younger. Don't go treating me like a fucking senior citizen.\" Amanda had taken Samantha and Anthony out for the day, wanting to give the two men some time to get acquainted. Something that was happening more often now much to everyone's surprise. This was the first time the two of them had finally agreed to some friendly sparring on the mat since putting aside their differences. It had seemed easier to use the LaRusso family dojo since they could break for food without too much bother unlike at the strip mall. Also, Daniel was still hesitant to step foot into a Cobra Kai dojo to train ever since his time with Silver. There were some things he still was not ready to let go of. Johnny still couldn't figure out what had gone wrong. He had been training with Miguel and the others for almost a year now, in peak physical shape, and had never had a problem before. Apparently he had made one wrong step or turned in an odd way, throwing out his back. The worst part was the embarrassment he felt being nursed by Daniel. Maybe they were getting along better but that didn't mean he wanted to be shown up on the mat, nor be in such a vulnerable position to the other. Daniel placed the cream on the coffee table before rubbing his hands together. \"Alright, tell me where the pain is and we'll get this muscle cream on there.\" \"Woah, woah, woah!\" Johnny gave him a disgusted look, \"I don't want some dude rubbing me down! I can do this myself thank you very much!\" It was now the brunette's turn to roll his eyes. \"Figures you'd be weird about it. Fine be my guest!\" he handed over the bottle of cream. \"Dual Action? What the hell does that mean?\" Johnny asked reading off the bottle. \"It means it goes on cool and then will activate to warm up for penetrating muscle relief.\" \"Penetrating?\" Johnny shot him a look, \"Here you are ready to rub me down with cream and you use the word penetrating ?\" \"See for yourself. That's the exact wording they use on the packaging, I just read it!\" \"Likely story.\" Johnny did give the label a once over, it did in fact say penetrating. Opening the bottle he squeezed out some of the medicated rub on to his fingers. He inhaled sharply as he shifted to his side, groaning as he tried to move his shirt out of the way and reach his back. \"Fuck!\" he growled in pain, hesitantly relenting as he laid flat along the couch again. He looked over at Daniel who was just smiling stupidly at his suffering. \"You just gonna stand there?\" Johnny barked. Daniel continued to grin. \"I guess, unless there was something else you wanted me to do?\" There was a long pause before Johnny finally spoke quietly. \"Asshole.\" \"Pardon? I couldn't quite hear you.\" \"…I need help.\" \"I thought that's what you said.\" Daniel cheekily replied as he walked over, helping Johnny into a sitting position. \"Shirt off.\" He directed. \"Seriously?\" Johnny raised an eyebrow. \"Do you want my help or not John?\" The blonde relented, allowing Daniel to pull his shirt off of him, groaning in pain as his back spasmed. \"Shit, can you hurry it the hell up man?\" Daniel was getting the cream ready as he moved to have better access to Johnny's back. \"Trust me, I'm doing this as quickly as I can. So where is the pain?\" Johnny grimaced, \"Lower back.\" Gently Daniel pressed his hands against the others back, slowly starting to massage the cream against his skin. The blonde inhaled sharply at first but soon found it soothing. \"That feels pretty good...\" Johnny hummed, starting to finally feel some relief for the first time since his injury. \"Yeah? Is this the right spot?\" \"Right there, it feels so good.\" Johnny groaned, \"A little harder though?\" Daniel began to apply more pressure, \"Like this?\" \"Hell yes!\" \"Dad? Mr. Larusso?\" Both men jumped, Johnny yelling out obscenities as he flicked his back. Robby was flushed, looking on in shock and possibly horror. \"I, uh, had no idea. I just came to practice, didn't realize I'd be interrupting anything.\" The teen blurted out as he started to back up. \"Robby wait, it's not what you think.\" Daniel's eyes widened as he thought about the words he had just spoken. \"God, what do you think is happening?\" Hazel eyes darted between the two grown men, \"I have no idea Mr. Larusso. Do I even want to know?\" \"Your old man threw out his back.\" Daniel tried to explain. \"Once again, you call me an old man but need I remind you there is only one year difference?\" Johnny hissed out in pain. \"But how does that lead to…\" Robby waved his arms around to motion to the situation before him, \"this?\" \"Muscle relaxant cream.\" Daniel held up the Rub-A535. \"Oh.\" Robby nodded. He wasn't sure if that was sufficient enough of an answer but he also didn't want to continue with this conversation either. \"So, the dojo… can I use it? Or is now not a good time?\" \"Go ahead. I don't think we'll be needing it anytime soon. Your dad will need a few days to recover.\" \"Alright. I'll just uh, leave you to it.\" Robby gave a small wave before he continued his way through the house back to the dojo. Johnny just glared at him with icy blue eyes. \"I told you it would be awkward.\" \"Do you feel better?\" Daniel questioned. Johnny refused to answer, which the other took as a yes.

Click on the book cover for the poster. Karafe Kid \"Daniel-san, come here.\" The older Japanese man beckoned for the young man to come to the truck where he was standing. Daniel Larusso ran over to the vehicle to stand beside Kesuke Miyagi. \"What is it Mr. Miyagi?\" he asked, not sure what was in store for him next. Every time he was called over he expected to be put through some unorthodox training method. Wax the car, sand the floor, paint the fence; it was only lately that he had learned that these seemingly menial tasks were building muscle and teaching him basic defensive blocks. \"Daniel-san, you train good. Grow stronger. Now take break.\" He handed the keys of the truck to Daniel. \"We go get drink.\" Minutes later the two were driving down the road with the occasional \"turn here\" thrown in. At last Daniel was directed to park in front of a business with a sign that read 'Koffee Karafe'. Miyagi climbed out of the truck and walked to the front door. \"Come, get drink\" he commanded. Daniel took the keys and followed. \"I thought you were going to have tea, or maybe a beer\" Daniel said as they walked through the door. Inside, the smell of coffee filled the room. \"I have tea at house. This special occasion\" he explained as he led Daniel to a table where the young man sat down. Meanwhile, a middle-aged man in a brown apron approached their table with a grin on his face. He and Miyagi exchanged bows. \"Billy-san, this is my student Daniel.\" Billy stuck out his hand and Daniel shook it. \"Glad to meet you, Daniel. Mr. Miyagi, I haven't seen you in some time; to what do I owe the pleasure?\" \"I wish teach Daniel-san finer point of Karate. Two special please.\" Daniel wasn't sure, but he thought Mr. Miyagi winked with the last request. Billy bowed again. \"My pleasure\" he answered and left to disappear into the kitchen. Miyagi sat at the table, which had chairs for four and contained a centerpiece bowl of fruit and nuts. \"Observe please\" he said as he pointed toward the back of the cafe. Servers were coming in and out the door of the kitchen on their way to bringing or relaying customer orders. The back area was crowded and offered very little space between tables; the servers had to weave and twist their way through the maze to deliver food and drink, their trays tilting and turning to match. Some delivered hot coffee in cups, but others carried tall carafes along with glasses of ice. The server would deftly set the tray down on the table, then while holding the glass in one hand pour from the carafe held several feet higher. The glass was set in front of the customer with a flourish and the staff member would move on. \"That's pretty good, I don't think he spilled a drop\" Daniel remarked with awe. \"Easy to balance on boat or pier post with nothing in hand. But trick is same: concentrate\" Miyagi explained. Billy returned from the back with a tray and a carafe with a glass. He too exhibited the balance and poise of his employees as he made his way to the front table, gliding and pivoting as needed to make progress. He set down the tray and grabbed the glass, filling it from the carafe while turning to provide an additional challenge. He placed the glass and carafe in front of Daniel, bowed and left. Daniel took a drink of his iced coffee and smacked his lips. \"Remember Daniel-san, karate not just power; control important. See how waiter move with purpose, no hesitate once start.\" His picked up a walnut from the table. \"How you open?\" he asked Daniel. \"A hammer I guess. I could drive the truck over it though\" he grinned. \"No hammer here. No eat after truck run over.\" He concentrated and squeezed the shell until a soft 'crack' was heard, then he opened his palm and the shell split in two leaving the nut meat exposed. \"Control\" he said. \"I still think a hammer would be easier, but I gotta admit that Ali would be impressed. Hey Mr. Miyagi, where's your drink?\" \"In back. You go get.\" He pointed to Billy, who was by the back doors beckoning Daniel to come to the kitchen. \"ME?\" \"Yes. Do not spill. Concentrate. Go.\" Daniel reluctantly got up from his chair and threaded his way to the back before disappearing through the kitchen doors. He reappeared a few minutes later, dressed in a brown apron and holding a tray in both hands. Several times he started to move forward, only to shrink back when an opening closed. He shifted the tray and gave a 'what do I do?' gesture to Miyagi, who stood and showed Daniel a posture of upright confidence before letting his fingers indicate walking. Daniel set his jaw and dove into the dining area. He bobbed, weaved, and sidestepped as he wove a serpentine path through the tables, just missing the calamity of dumping his tray on a customer in a business suit and crashing into a nun. By the time he got to his table he had a grin of achievement on his face as he sat the tray on the table. \"Didn't think I could do it, did you?\" he boasted. \"Not done. Now pour\" Miyagi stated. The smile vanished from Daniel's face as he looked at the carafe. He took it, then held the glass timidly as though it would break just by looking at it. Sweat broke out on his forehead. \"You can do. Concentrate.\" Daniel gulped and lifted the carafe higher, then tipped it. The coffee poured out and he barely caught the first bit before adjusting to the flow. He finished without slopping any, and set the glass in front of Miyagi while someone closed the front door with a slam. Distracted, he knocked over the glass and it spilled its contents across the table, some of it into his teacher's lap. He scrambled for napkins while apologizing. \"It Okay, Daniel-san. No argument if glass half full or half empty today.\" Miyagi laughed at his own joke. Daniel heard clapping, and turned around to see several of the servers clapping from the back at his performance. Billy was grinning and making his way to the table as Daniel's cheeks reddened in embarrassment. \"Don't worry about it kid,\" Billy said as he clapped him on the back \"why do you think we wear brown aprons anyway? But in honor of your lesson today, I give you the title 'Karafe Kid'. Good luck on your training.\" The next day Ali suggested they go for a coffee. Daniel paled and told her he was staying away from coffee while he was training for the tournament. The End A/N: Of course based on a title pun; the poster came first, the story afterward.

You couldn't pinpoint where it started but whenever that feeling that would well up in your chest and made you feel like you might throw up, you knew it wasn't from seeing Ali. That made it so much worse. No logical explanation for it all and those more you ignored it the more pressing it became until you found yourself staring at him.

Why else would he smile at you like that? The night after Halloween, your body was still aching from that chop to the sternum and you couldn't see out of your left eye that well. You could hardly believe it when you saw him walk through the doors of the dojo again, this time with his little oriental friend that beat you and your friends bloody. As usual, all you could do was look at him until your attention was suddenly pulled elsewhere. He looked nervous for once and it made you smile involuntarily. You stand next to them as the adults talk, and you breathed in a little deeper when you recognized his smell, while you looked at him from the corner of your good eye, and thought about how good he looked all banged up like that. You didn't even care anymore, you figured you might as well let your thoughts get weird if it means you can resist touching him all the more. His little guardian angel talked to your sensei about fairness and equal odds, even had the nerve to demand you and your friends leave him alone. You figured it wasn't your fault for beating on him, at least last night. The little brat liked to instigate fights and then run away, although you were more than happy to chase him down every time. You agreed to it anyway, agreed to leave him alone until the next time you would get to properly kick his ass. Could it tremble stars from moonlit skies? Could it drag a tear from your cold eyes? I live on the right side, I sleep in the left That's why everything's got to be love or death When you saw him at school the next day, he was even worse than usual. You spotted him and your ex-love canoodling by his locker like they always do, and when he suddenly started to walk your way, your chest got the same feeling of oppressive tightness it always did when he got too close. He was still smiling like he could tell what you'd been thinking and for a second you considered this a real possibility. Your eyes didn't even go to her this time, not even when she purposely brushed your body with hers as she walked past with him by her side. No, you were too busy looking straight into those dark little doe-eyes that were only inches away from yours for those few glorious seconds. His smart-ass remark made you want to grab him and pin him to the ground, steal that smile off his lips with your own mouth. But you couldn't. You knew you couldn't. So you just watched while he walked away with his blonde princess in tow and you still couldn't keep your eyes from lingering on him from across the courtyard, watching still as they talked and kissed on each other some more until he's finally alone again. You however, were not, so what you had in mind for him would have to wait for now. But life did not want you to have your way, not even a little bit, and once again that little doe-eyed deer is saved by a nearby adult like some sort of black magic destined on frustrating you all the more. You couldn't help but admire his methods, he was sneaky and even more self-assured when he knew he had you cornered, even had the guts to reach out an touch you, as your breath was nearly knocked out of you by that feather-light pressure on your shoulder. You were starting to think the universe had some sort of personal vendetta against you. The next time it happened, you were alone. It was a typical hot California afternoon and you were once again, late to third-period class. When you closed your locker door and gathered your books in your arms, his voice nearly startled you enough to make you jump. \"Hi.\" For a moment you were a little stunned. What the hell was this? He piped up again when you didn't respond at first, ever so stubborn for attention it seemed. \"It's not very nice to ignore people, you know. Unless you would really prefer to just stare at me all this time.\" You could feel your eyes go wide and you tried to fight the expression on your face with your usual sneered frown that you used only for him, \"What?\" That little prick, taunting you as always, maybe you could refresh that black eye you gave him last week, he looked better bruised up anyway, and you could imagine what he'd look like with your hickeys all over his neck, little marks littering his stomach and his thighs, and if it would sound as good as it did in your head every night. You were so caught up in your thoughts of him that you didn't even realize he'd been stepping closer all that time. Little by little, until your noses could have touched if you only leaned in a little bit more. Your voice sounded so quiet you almost felt embarrassed by it. \"What are you doing?\" He inched even closer and you were sure he could feel your heart beating so strongly in your chest. \"I have noticed, you know.\" He was smiling as he said it and you really didn't know what to do with the feeling that came over you just then. You debated just punching him in the mouth so hard he would have undoubtedly lost a tooth, and walking briskly away to where you were supposed to be in the first place. Just punch him and walk away and never as much look in his direction again. As your eyes went to his mouth, you couldn't help but notice that his front teeth were crooked. \"I like you, Johnny.\" You couldn't move, he had you pinned now with nowhere to go. You could have shoved him off of you and ran like you were planning to, but as usual, he was quick enough to trick you. It felt better than anything you ever imagined on your own and you closed your eyes in spite of yourself. After a few seconds he pulled back, and any anger that even managed to remain was just as soon dissipated by that beautiful smile he gave you. You still couldn't work up the nerve to say anything to him yet. Instead, you dropped your books and squeezed him so tight you thought for a second you might break a rib, and kissed him again before he could make another snide remark. Although, as soon as you felt him smile against your mouth, you knew that he didn't need to say much of anything anyway.

You're the one who has been arguing with me every step of the way!\" \"Want me to do it sensei? Robby and I got ours set up like 10 mins ago.\" Miguel smiled brightly as he knelt down to inspect what had been done so far with the tent, which wasn't much. \"Yeah, perfect,\" Johnny dropped the poles he held as he stood and dusted off his jeans. Daniel shot Johnny a look before turning to the others student with a smile. \"Thank you Miguel, but no. We can take care of this. Where is Robby by the way?\" Johnny watched as Miguel shrugged. You could tell he still wasn't keen on the other teen but he was trying hard to keep it to himself, probably for Johnny's sake. \"I dunno, went to get firewood?\" \"Alright,\" Daniel motioned off to the brush, \"How about you help him with that. Remember, we are here to build bridges. Hard to do that if you're here and Robby is out there.\" Miguel looked at Johnny who just shrugged his shoulders. The teen rolled his eyes before standing and leaving. \"Why the hell did you send him away? Why are we messing around with this when he could have it done in a minute flat?\" Johnny finally complained once his student was out of earshot. \"You know Robby and Miguel aren't the only ones who need to work things out right?\" Daniel's voice was dry as he looked over the instructions again. The blonde gave a sigh, once again grabbing a tent pole and trying to ease it into the seam of the tent. \"Remember when camping was canvas tents without all this high tech shit? What tents need separate rooms?\" Daniel laughed, \"Oh? I thought it would make you happy. You did say you didn't want to share a tent.\" Johnny raised an eyebrow. \"Actually, I think I said I had no intention of going on this god damn trip. Yet here I am.\" With a few more tries they finally were able to set the tent up, only working on securing the fly as the teens returned. \"This seems like a hell of a lot of work for one night Larusso…\" Daniel smiled, \"It's all about the experience Johnny, right Robby?\" The blonde watched the exchange of smiles between his son and rival. His jaw clenched as he tried to keep himself together. \"Right Robby?\" He repeated, looking between the two for an explanation. \"Mr. Larusso brought me out here to train, not long before the tournament actually. It helped a lot.\" His son explained. His blood boiled. Not that he had ever expected his son to take up karate, but at the same time it hurt that it wasn't him teaching Robby. If there was anything useful he could pass on to his son, karate would be it. Yet once again in his life, nothing worked out. His own son had gone to the enemy. \"You were taking my kid camping in the wilderness? Did his mom know?\" He sighed throwing his head back, remembering his last exchange with his ex, \"Like hell she knew. What kind of creep takes kids overnight in the forest without his parents' permission?\" Johnny's voice was starting to rise but he clenched his fists, just like he had at the tournament meeting that one night. \"Mr. Larusso –\" Robby started before Daniel cut him off. \"First, I did not know he was your son. Secondly, we only came up for a day trip that time. We got back in time to have dinner with my family.\" Daniel held up his hands in defense. \"Wait what?\" Miguel butted in, \"Robby was with you the day he had dinner with you guys? He wasn't with Sam?\" Everyone stared at Miguel. \"That's a pretty specific question Diaz.\" Johnny laughed. Robby shook his head, \"Wait, how did you know I had dinner with them?\" \"Woah, woah, woah,\" Daniel shook his head, \"You know my daughter Samantha?\" \"Yeah, she's my girlfriend.\" \"Girlfriend?!\" Johnny chuckled, \"What's wrong Larusso? You got a problem with your daughter dating a Cobra Kai?\" \" Ex -girlfriend.\" Robby said with a smirk. \"Yeah, because of you? Maybe you should back off and find your own girl!\" Miguel shot back. \"The hell?\" Johnny looked between the two boys before his eyes landed on Daniel. \"Teaching my son your old tricks huh?\" \"I didn't teach him anything other than karate.\" Daniel glared back before he turned to Robby. \"Wait, are you making a move on my daughter?\" \"No! We're just friends.\" There was a lull as the four of them stood there, staring each other down. \"Why don't we go down to the docks to practice?\" Daniel finally suggested. His voice was strained and it was easy to tell he was trying desperately to keep his cool after the discussion of his daughter. \"Heh,\" Johnny smiled, \"We gonna kick their asses into the water?\" Robby rolled his eyes at his father before turning to walk away. \"Not quite,\" Daniel smiled, \"You'll see when we get down there.\" Johnny shook his head as he sat back in a camp chair. \"Nah, I don't need any of your pansy ass karate, thanks.\" It was now Daniel's turn to roll his eyes at the blonde. \"What do you say Miguel, you coming?\" The teen was quiet for a moment as he studied his sensei's rival. \"Were you the one that taught Sam karate?\" He finally asked. Daniel looked confused for a moment before answering. \"Yes, I taught her when she was little. Why do you ask?\" Miguel smiled, \"Well she showed me some pretty cool moves. So I was thinking if you taught her, then maybe you're kind of alright…\" A warm and genuine smile spread across Daniel's face. His daughter, doing karate with her boyfriend. Not that he wanted to think about her having a boyfriend, but the fact that even if she was too cool to practice with him, she hadn't forgotten everything he had taught her. \"Do you mind sensei?\" Johnny sighed, \"I don't give a shit Diaz. Just grab me a drink from the cooler before you go. And don't expect any of that touchy feely bull shit when we get back to the dojo.\" For the most part this little outing seemed like quite the bust. The only highlight Johnny could see was that night after dinner with the four of them shooting the shit together around the campfire. Robby had smiled and even laughed at a few of his jokes. Perhaps there was still a chance for him and his son after all. The teens had already retired to their tent and Johnny watched as Daniel carefully went about extinguishing the fire. \"Hey Larusso… thanks. I mean for setting up this time with Robby. We haven't had a lot of time together. It's been… nice.\" He finally managed. The other man shrugged with a sheepish grin. \"I know growing up I'd have given anything for more time with my dad. Robby's a good kid. Give him time and he'll warm up.\" Johnny nodded, kicking a rock on the ground. \"And Diaz? How did he do today?\" \"He's a good kid too,\" Daniel chuckled. \"I hate to admit it, you've trained him pretty well.\" The blonde smirked. \"Damn straight I did.\" Daniel stood, brushing off his pants. The two grown men stood in awkward silence. \"So I'm gonna hit the hay. You know we've got to get an early start to get everything packed in the morning.\" \"Yeah,\" Johnny nodded, \"Me too. Hey… night Larusso.\" Daniel was already heading back to the tent, a smile spreading across his face once more knowing the other couldn't see it. \"Night Johnny.\" He called over his shoulder.

Since I am new to all this if you guys have any advice or anything that you would like to say to help me you're welcome to. For everyone wondering, this is going to be a Sam and Miguel fanfiction romantic story(yes it will have the stuff around like school and house life with the families, but it will primarily focus on Sam's and Miguel's romance story)(at least whatever I make up in my head) Sam Sam just got home from the karate tournament and she was feeling furious at Miguel! She didn't understand where all this new stuff was coming from, What was all this talk about striking first and she couldn't for the life of her understand why Miguel felt like Robby was the \"enemy\".He didn't know Robby so how could he judge him? She understood that Robby was against Miguel in this tournament but this just a stupid contest...right?She thought to herself as she went up to her room, locked herself in and jumped on her bed. As she let out a loud sigh her mom (Amanda, I can't figure out if I want to tell this in third person or first person so I chose both xD)knocked on the door.\"Sam, honey open the door I want to talk to you\".Samantha groaned as she got up from her bed and went to unlock the door.\"Unlocked\" she called and she pressed the button. Amanda(Sam's mom) As she walked into the room she saw her daughter Samantha with a frown on her face. She knew it was from the boy that talked to her during the karate tournament. Apparently, Sam had become his girlfriend(She didn't really mind that part) But he was in Cobra Kai. The karate dojo that her husband Daniel hated because of their sensei Johhny Lawrence. Amanda herself didn't care and thought of it as an old high school boy feud and that Daniel and Johnny had to get rid of the bad blood between them once and for all. She didn't care if they were friends or not, just that they stopped hating each other because ever since they had met again since high school, everything just went downhill. Sam hadn't told her much, Just that he behaved like a jerk to her on one of the other nights and that she was so mad at him. Then she asked Sam \"is it that boy\"?Sam understood her immediately and nodded her head. What did he say, honey?\"Just some things about Robby\" Sam replied. Wait, Robby? Samantha, how does he know Robby? Amanda smelled something fishy here and she was going to get to the bottom of it like she always does. Sam He goes to our school mom. Miguel and Robby have some of the same classes. That's how he knows Robby. Mom looked at her funny. Or at least Sam thought it was funny. Her mom was looking at her differently and it started to make Sam nervous. She knew she was lying to mom but she couldn't just tell her that she and Robby had gone to a party. besides, that would get Robby in trouble because then her mother would know that he was lying to her just to help out Sam when she was grounded.\"Sam...(her mom took a pause that made Sam really nervous)you know Robby works at the dealership right?\"Dammit! Sam knew she was caught and had to confess or make something up REAL fast! She decided to start out with truths and then work in the lies, she couldn't rat on Robby for what he did for her but she knew she was caught here and had to choose her words carefully.\"So I drove Robby home because you told me to, remember when he injured his leg?\"Sam continued while her mother briefly nodded.\"And while we were driving I saw Miguel on the side of the road so I stopped to say hello, you know since I can't even use my phone!\" \"Samantha\"! \"You were involved in a hit and run accident!\" you caused a lot of trouble and because of that you needed to be punished, I grounded you as punishment end of story!\" Sorry mom, I guess I'm just frustrated because of Miguel. Is that his name honey?\"Yes, mom\" I replied and then mom told me to continue. I then told her that he acted crazy after seeing Robby in the car and started acting like a jerk. After that, I just drove Robby home and came back as soon as I could. By now Sam had tears in her eyes after remembering that night. That night had come to her in her dreams but opening it now to someone was just like opening a raw wound and it hurt her terribly. Amanda Well honey, why didn't you ask why he was behaving like that? You know men aren't good and you need to explain things to them. It was clear to Amanda that her old boyfriend.., Miguel(!) She remembered his name)didn't understand what was going on with sam and was sure that if she just explained her side of the story the boy would understand and although all that had been funny Sam's reaction was the best! She just replied with \"Well I didn't think about that mom\" well I guess you were just shook about what happened honey Amanda said at an attempt to encourage her daughter...and it worked! Sam, I'm so happy to see you smiling again Amanda exclaimed as she walked out her daughter's door and shouted \"I'm going to make dinner honey!\" and after a second she heard a shout back \"thanks, mom!\" Sam Sam looked out the window and saw the beautiful night sky and the amazing night lights of the valley and smiled. She decided that she would talk with Miguel tomorrow, and she realized that apparently, she wasn't grounded anymore since her mom had left her phone, watch and laptop on her bed. Well, at least something became good about this day she thought just as she remembered that she missed the rest of the tournament! She wondered who won? Did Miguel win? Or Robby? Did anyone get hurt? And where was dad? the tournament had to be done by now..why wasn't he back home yet?

This chapter is basically about what happened after Sam left the tournament so if you want a recap you could also watch the last episode on Youtube Red and start it at 22:50 because that is when I'm starting the story. Before starting id like to give a special thanks to spiderduck1985, JuliaBeth and all other people who reviewed my first chapter and gave me a lot of motivation to keep going. I also want to give a special thanks to Belle Tris Grey and eagle219406 for being my first 2 story followers! Now, remember to review the chapter and give me advice so I can improve and I hope you enjoy this chapter :D (BTW This takes place on a Sunday but IDK if its the same on the show) Meanwhile Johnny \"This is it, moment we've all been waiting final match to determine who will be victor and champion\" Johnny was excited, not nervous because being nervous was for the weak and he wasn't, although he did not want to be weak we knew he trained Miguel just like he was trained and that he had given everything to be at this moment. but there was still all this bad blood between him and Robby but he was still scared because Robby was still his son and nothing could change that.\"Will it be Miguel Diaz from Cobra Kai Karate?\" said the referee as cheering and applause was heard from the audience.\"Will it be Robby Keene,unaffili-\" the referee continued talking but Johnny hadn't been listing because he had been talking to Miguel and getting him ready mentally and reminding him of all their lessons but then the referee continued after his pause and said, \"Daniel LaRusso is gonna coach!\"Johnny felt the anger because he felt that LaRusso had turned his own son against him and even if they weren't close it still pained him and he totally blanked out as the referee continued. He just felt betrayed by his son and angry at Daniel LaRusso for turning Ali and now his son Robby against him and now his son was fighting for Miyagi-Do Karate? He knew he had to talk to Daniel so he approached and asked him \"What do you think you're doing?\"Daniel replied with \"Coaching my student, someone has to be there for him\"Johnny couldn't believe the audacity that Daniel had even after all these years. Johnny had just gone furious from what Daniel said but he wouldn't show that to Daniel, Cobra Kai has no weakness and showing your feelings was a weakness!\"Do you think this is funny?\" Johnny asked Daniel to which he responded with \"do you see me laughing? Johnny hated his smart ass comments so he just said \"You're gonna regret this when its over\" and then Daniel's smart ass replied with \"yeah right, like this'll ever be over\"well that was one thing that Johnny could agree with Daniel at least. After that Johnny and Daniel took their corners and Johnny gave one last pep talk before the match started. He told Miguel\"You know what to do. You've trained all year for this\". Miguel Miguel knew that what his sensei was saying was the truth. He needed to win this fight for Sam and for Cobra Kai! He responded to his sensei with \"Don't worry sensei, I won't let LaRusso or that kid go home a winner\" and after that, he went onto that mats and got ready for the match. All around him the stadium was going crazy with cheering and applause from the audience from their excitement.\"Face me. Bow\"The other referee said as he and\"Robby\" the dude Sam brought with her to the party bowed their heads. After when the referee said \"Each other. Bow\" Miguel didn't know what \"Robby\" was feeling but he himself didn't want to bow and only did it because it was mandatory and for good sportsmanship. Then the referee said \"Fighting positions\"...and then \"Ready?\".Miguel had never been this ready in his life, and when the referee finally said: \"And fight!\" After that Miguel just immediately leapt forward. Kicks and punches were thrown from both Miguel and Robby each trying their best to defeat the other when Robby blocked Miguel's advances pushed him and then did a spinning kick throwing him to the ground and scoring a point for Miyagi-Do Karate. Miguel was furious and quickly got up and ready to strike on the second round when Sensei Lawrence shouted from his corner behind him \"Remember the pitching machine. Don't get hit!\"Then quickly just after Miguel understood what Sensei Lawrence meant he heard the referee shout \"Ready? And fight!\"Robby came at him hard, striking fast but Miguel remembered what sensei taught him and dodged all of his hits until he found an opportunity to kick him in the shoulder. As Robby flinched with pain Miguel realized that his weakness what his shoulder and he punched the already hurt Robby in the stomach to make him go down so Cobra-Kai Karate would get a point. Miguel heard the crowd applause and clapping and the narrator say \"Diaz and Cobra Kai with the point. Now its 1-1\".The referee then asked \"ready? And...fight!\" The round started off like the last one with Robby striking low and high, fast and hard but Miguel remembered the lessons that Sensei Lawrence taught him and managed to dodge all of his attempts until he saw an opportunity and hit his shoulder against Robby's shoulder...he saw Robby flinch with pain as he took a step back before Miguel went under him and made him trip and fall straight down on his shoulder and back. Then Miguel finally saw the opportunity to score the point and got up fast and punched Robby, but not just in any place. If Miguel just wanted the point a simple punch anywhere would have been enough but Miguel wanted to win and Miguel was Cobra Kai and Cobra Kai show no mercy! Miguel got up and punched Robby hard and fast right in his right shoudler...his weakness. With all the applause around and cheering Miguel felt like he was the winner already!As the narrator said\"that makes two points for Diaz\"Miguel felt sooo good but then LaRusso shouted:\"Time!. Time!\" and Miguel just felt bummed because he didn't know that there were timeouts and the timeout was going to ruin his momentum? Miguel waited while LaRusso talked to Robby his student until finally, the referee asked: \"All right, Keene, are you ready? Can you continue?\" Robby replied with \"Yeah\" and Miguel got hyped! He was ready to finish this fight once and for all. The score was 2-1 and he was in the lead and if he just got one more point he would win. As the referee said \"fighting positions\" Miguel got ready to attack. To strike first and to show no mercy as Sensei Lawrence taught him. When the shout from the referee came: \"Fight\" Miguel was ready, he kicked straight away but Robby blocked it. That left Miguel stunned but he continued. Punch, punch, and punch. Miguel tried to punch Robby 5 times but somehow every time Robby managed to block or dodge it, and then finally when Miguel thought he had an opening, Robby somehow managed to push him out of bounds. As Miguel went back to his corner he felt the anger in him but there was nothing he could do to stop it. As soon as the referee said \"Ready? And fight!\" Miguel leapt forward with a punch and when Robby dodged it Miguel just pushed into him with his shoulder and it worked because Robby fell and that gave Miguel an opportunity which he took and kicked Robby in the chest but the referee didn't give him a point so Robby tried to kick him again but Robby rolled over and gave Miguel a kick that he had never seen! As much as Miguel hated Robby he could not deny that that kick had been something special and something that he wants to learn as well. But as he heard the narrator say \"How about that? A two-legged kick? He got all mad again, he was better than Robby and he knew it! As Miguel crawled on the floor with pain he knew that no matter how many of those kicks Robby did he was going to win this for Sam! But when Robby reached out his hand to help up Miguel he just dropped Robby to the ground. As soon as he did it he knew it was a mistake and the crowd booing him confirmed what he felt but he couldn't go back in time and change it. It was even worse when he got a warning for unsportsmanlike contact by the referee. Johnny Just as Miguel pulled Robby down Johnny realized that this was like the situation that happened to him 35 years ago(I don't remember exactly how many so this is roughly the number)The illegal move that he pulled and everything that was happing looked the same as when he was a kid fighting Daniel LaRusso and he knew that he needed to change Miguel before it was too late so he called Miguel over but before he could say anything Miguel told him\"I found his weakness, Sensei. It's his shoulder\".When Miguel told him that Johnny finally knew what a mistake he did by teaching Miguel the dark morales of Cobra-Kai, it was like the kid had two different personalities. The sweet child one and the now, no mercy bitter kid. He knew he had to try to change Miguel or he could lose his girl like Johnny had. It didn't matter if the girl was a LaRusso or not, Johnny lost Ali to Daniel LaRusso and he couldn't let Miguel lose that LaRusso girl. He quickly thought of something and said \"Look, I know we want to win, but it's got to be the right way. We don't have to fight dirty.\" \"Dirty?\"Miguel answered \"There's nothing dirty about winning, Sensei. You taught me that.\"When Miguel told him that Johnny understood the magnitude of the mistake he made by teaching the dark Cobra-Kai morales and hoped that other student hadn't been affected as than walked away but before he did he said \"Don't worry. I got mercy\".As Miguel walked away Johnny regretted the dark parts of Cobra-Kai that had brought up this new side of Miguel and wished he could change it. Miguel As Miguel got back on the sparring mats he heard the referee explain to the crowd:\"Whoever wins the next point will be our new champion!\"The crowd cheered as the referee continued \"Its 2-2. Next point wins.\" As Miguel got into his fighting stance to get ready for the last round the referee continued \"Okay, good luck to both of you\". As Miguel was getting into his mental state for fighting the referee asked him and Robby for the last time \"Ready? And fight!\" As soon as the referee said that Miguel lunged forward with a punch, two punches and a kick to which Robby blocked them all and then came at Miguel with a spinning kick himself that grazed Miguel's back. The spinning kick got Miguel a little aggravated and as he was getting ready in position again and was ready to strike first, Miguel saw Robby's leg come toward him in the middle of a kick and then he saw an opportunity. Miguel took hold of Robby's leg and held it there causing Robby to not be able to move and then he kicked with all his power Robby in his right shoulder. His weakness! That was the end and Miguel knew that he had won as he hit Robby with a spinning kick to knock Robby to the ground.\"Winner\" the referee shouted as he lifted Miguel's hand. Miguel felt so happy about winning, he knew he could prove to Sam that he was the best! The cheering and applause gave him such a good feeling in his heart. He felt like for once he had done something worthy and it gave him such a good feeling that he loved. After that Hawk and the rest of the guys from Cobra-Kai Dojo ran onto the mats and hugged Miguel. It felt great to make them proud. Then, the judge presented Miguel with the trophy and asked if Miguel wanted to say anything and of course he did.\"I just want to say that if it wasn't for my sensei, I wouldn't be here, so this is for Sensei Johnny Lawrence and Cobra Kai!\" Johnny While all the kids were cheering \"Cobra Kai\" Johnny knew he had to go talk to his kid, The kicks that Miguel gave his shoulder were probably hurting very bad and even with all the bad blood he still needed to talk to him and check if he is ok, so as he walked off stage with Daniel LaRusso he called out \"Robby\" and Robby turned around.\"I...I'm-I'm sorry.\" He followed up. And then Robby gave the response that Johnny least expected \"Its okay, Dad. It's ok\".At that moment Johnny felt happy that at least the bad blood between him and his son had gotten better and he also felt a little gratitude for Daniel because he probably helped with that.\"Let's go Mr. LaRusso\" Robby said and started walking away but then Daniel looked at Jonny and said \"You got what you wanted, Johnny. You won. Congratulations\". and walked away giving Johnny a feeling that he didn't even know. Miguel After winning Miguel got a lot of people coming up to him and congratulating him but there was only one person that he was looking for. Sam. As he was looking for Sam he came upon his mother and grandmother who congratulated him and told him he was great but he only heard them in one ear because he was so focused on finding Sam and only fully paid attention to his mom when she shouted \"Miggy\" the nickname she had given him since he was a little child and asked if he was okay. He told her that he was fine and that he was justs looking for someone and then he left them to continue searching for Sam. He next found Demetri who told him \"he was reconsidering joining Cobra Kai. He still isn't into the idea of getting punched in the face but he respects the safety in numbers aspect of joining a gang\". He didn't really listen to what he said but since he was in the same grade with him and Sam he decided to ask him if he had seen her only to be disappointed because he told Miguel that he saw her leaving a while ago which means that she didn't even see him win and she might have not even seen the match between him and Robby. Miguel then thought to himself \"I have to go talk to Sam tomorrow\". Okay, so I hope you all enjoy this chapter!

Pray for my soul. *Edit: As of May, I have decided to revise this sorry as my writing style is a bit different now and I wanted to update it as I found few errors and such. It's 9:30 pm on a Wednesday. Johnny needs to be at Tommy's party by 10:00. He is making an important stop first. [Apartment 20.] I open the door to his apartment and step into the living room. It's decorated modestly, with little strings of orange lights, paper lanterns, and various other festive things laying around. Evil Dead is playing on his TV and I'm momentarily distracted as I watch Ash decapitate Linda. I spy some candy in a bowl by the door. But where's the thing I'm looking for? I take off my shoes and step into the dimly lit kitchen. \"Hey LaRusso! It's Johnny, I'm here.\" He's home right? The door isn't locked. Better not have ran off with Fernandez and friends yet. \"Daniel where are y–\" \"Meow.\" I turn my head towards the sound. Oh, god. I am greeted by a very attractive sight. Daniel is leaning against his bedroom door frame, pretty much naked except for a few choice items. Black knee-high socks are on his legs, little black cat ears adorn his head, and I see a little tail poking out from the underwear he's wearing. And oh, those underwear are something special. Little black panties that fit him just right, a fetish I didn't know I had. What looks like a genuine BDSM collar, either that or a very unorthodox dog collar, is fastened snugly around his neck. The all-black outfit looks so good against his skin, and he looks oh-so temping that I can't help but stare at him. He looks at me knowingly. \"Do you like it?\" My mouth is suddenly dry and I lick my lips. \"Yeah uh, very much.\" He smiles that little half smile he makes whenever he's flirting, and I get a flutter-like feeling in my chest. He gets on his hands and knees and crawls towards me slowly, pressing himself to me, arms around me with his face level to my waist. \"I thought you might. So where are we going?\" He asks half serious, like I'd drag him to Tommy's looking like that. \"If you intend on crashing with Fernandez or whatever you plan on doing at Tommy's, you need to at least be appropriate and you cannot go out like this. You'll be the party centerpiece in that outfit, so go change.\" \"We could stay in.\" He palms the front of my jeans and I bite the inside of my cheek. I try to keep focused. \"I promised the guys I'd go.\" I run a hand through his hair, feeling the soft little ears on his head. He whines a bit. I can't help but smile at his attempt at convincing me. \"Wha-at?, I can't go and ditch unless you have a convincing excuse for me.\" He pouts and I chuckle a bit at his expression. He's not easy to resist. He looks up at me intently with those little doe eyes I love so much. \"Touch me.\" My resolve is starting to crack and I wonder if anyone would notice if I wasn't actually there. His arms tighten slightly around me and he nuzzles my lower stomach. He's certainly something tonight. I wonder what's got him so worked up but I'm certainly not complaining. I can't stop myself from making a crude remark, \"Kitty want milk?\" I gesture to my noticeable hard on. He looks taken aback, eying me skeptically. \"That's dirty.\" \"You're the one dressed like you're gonna go work a street corner, touching me like this, and you're calling me dirty?\" His mouth falls open in mock offense as he lets go of my waist and sits back on the floor, pouting. \"I'm absolutely adorable thank you very much, and not meant to be a target for such dirty jokes.\" Oh for fucks sake. \"You're sitting there wearing girls underwear.\" \"I'm comfortable with my body.\" He breaks into a mischievous smile. \"You're ridiculous. Come on, go change into something else, literally anything else that covers you, and we can go.\" I wonder if he's going to be sneaky and put on more lingerie. I know I'm supposed to be somewhere, but that thought is making me wish that he did. Some lace, maybe? \"I take you out like this and I get arrested for hanging out with an escort.\" That smirk is back on his face, \"You're not gettin' anything from me if you're this rude all night.\" I notice the D-rings on his collar and gesture to his neck, \"You have a leash I can put you on? God knows what would happen if you wander away looking like this.\" He looks excited now. \"Are we gonna go to the party like that?\" I attempt in vain to hold my ground. \"Let's go you jujyfruit¹, go put actual clothes on and be acceptable for outdoors.\" He gives me a stubborn glare. \"I try to be pretty for you and you're hardly showing any appreciation. Now, I'm hurt.\" I see the smallest trace of a smile and I'm temped to kiss his soft lips. Oh why not? I'm certainly not leaving here without something happening. I speak softly to him, in the way he likes when we're alone. \"Come closer and I'll make it up to you.\" Please come closer. Sit in my lap. Let me touch you or I might lose it. He hangs back still, leaning back on his legs. \"Be nice to me.\" I kneel down and lean in close to him, \"Come here.\" I purr in his ear. \"You'll like what I have in mind, I promise. Come here baby.\" That gets him. Into my lap he goes. \"Good kitty.\" I kiss him softly and he makes a little throaty sound that goes straight to my groin. Jesus Christ, I'm done for. He latches onto me, arms around my neck and legs around my hips, \"I like when you call me baby.\" His arms slink down to the floor, taking my hands in his and he caresses my fingers gently, like a real lover. \"Makes me feel nice.\" God he's so fucking cute when he's all clingy like this. We exchange heated kisses and I knaw urgently at his bottom lip, sucking gently. He's on me, grinding and squirming in my lap and I'm having a hard time thinking about anything but the feeling of him, weight pressing into my lap. I feel his mouth go to my neck and he bites down softly, leaving a little wet mark. I wrap my arms around him pulling him closer to me, purposefully grinding him into my lap, feeling how hard he is from all this, and when he moans softly against my neck I'm completely gone from the rest of reality. He does a sort of rolling motion with his hips and I'm seriously considering just bending the little tease over his coffee table. So far all I've done is feel him up and shove my tongue down his throat. I palm the straining fabric of his panties and he gasps out softly, and I feel his body twitch. Surely the party can wait. Just a quickie won't hurt. Everyone's probably too drunk to notice anyway. [Where's Johnny?] Meanwhile at Tommy's house the party is in full swing, but Johnny is MIA. It's 12:30am, two and a half hours after he said he's be there. A half-drunk Tommy is on his parents couch, cooler in hand and Barbara on his arm, wondering where the hell Johnny has run off to with his pot. He better have a good excuse. He glances at his watch and remembers something, he groans under his breath at the realization. Goddamnit Johnny, you better not be where I think you are. Footnotes [1] This 'insult' was used in an episode of Boy Meets World, and I thought it was funny. I also wanted to to say, thank you guys for almost 600 views. It might not seem like a lot in the grand scheme of fanfiction, but for me, it means a lot. So thanks, really. c:[Chapter 2] Hey there! This is where the story becomes M, explicit themes ahead . Warning you now. We break apart for a moment and I look at him, up close, taking it all in again. \"Where did you get get such an outfit?\" I had to know who or what was responsible for this. \"Ali gave me the socks, but the rest I bought myself.\" So he did buy the underwear. \"I like the ears, the socks are a nice touch. Leave 'em on when I fuck you.\" He blushes at my words. I take a seat on his couch and unzip my pants. \"You're gonna do something about this\", I gestured to my aching erection. \"You caused it after all.\" He looks happy at this, a smile making its way over his face. \"Get started, open up.\" He kneels down in front of me and rubs my hard on through my pants, and I feel myself twitch under his hand. I slide my jeans down my thighs so he has room to work. I can feel my heart in my chest and I'm way too excited for this. He places little kisses around my hips as he slowly strokes me up and down, and I unconsciously lean into his hand. He dips his head down, still looking up at me, brushes his lips across it, little tongue coming out to lick, and he teasing me again, kissing and brushing the tip against his lips, smearing precome over his mouth. I groan with need. \"C'mon you little tease, suck my cock already.\" He looks self conscious suddenly. I trace my thumb over his wet, open mouth. \"Just do what you can, I'll like it either way. Don't worry, you don't have to shove it down your throat or anything.\" I try to smile nicely, I don't want him to be nervous. He nods, and bites his lip in a way that's more seductive than nervous. Little teasing licks against the underside and head, slowly with precise intent, glancing up at me before taking the whole thing at once. He visibly gags once it hits his throat, but recovers when he relaxes a bit. I close my eyes a second, and when I open them he's still looking at me still. Man, I love his eyes. Watching him while he sucks me off is the hottest thing, I swear. It's already nice to have someone look at you while they do it but it's even better when it's with him. He's cute enough that it's almost innocent looking, despite the cock in his mouth. He feels so nice and I'm moaning uncontrollably. He's going at it with enthusiasm to rival a sorority girl and I vaguely wonder if he's practiced on something (someone?) before we ever got involved. I can't help but chuckle a bit at the thought of Daniel trying to deepthroat a banana. He looks questioningly at me at makes a sound that may have been words if his mouth wasn't so full. \"You're doing really good.\" Some encouragement. He tries to smile, but it comes out weird. I run my hands through his hair pulling at it a bit, and he moans around me. The sounds he makes as he's doing it are intoxicating, little moans and wet noises. I don't last very long and I completely lose it when I see him trying to subtly grind his erection into the carpeted floor, a wet spot visible on those black panties. \"Daniel, ah fuck that's it, don't stop, just like that...\" I'm shaking and a bit twitchy, trying to resist the urge to shove his head all the way down and stuff my cock right down his throat. Uh fuck how is he this good? He flicks his tongue against me and sucks harder, and I can barely warn him in time. \"On your face, let me...\" I don't wanna just come down his throat, I wanna see him lick it off his lips as it drips down his face. A little hesitantly, I pull out of his warm mouth, and he automatically lolls his tongue out. He gets half of it in his mouth before I purposefully cover the lower half of his face in it as he closes his eyes reflexively. There's quite a bit there and for a second he looks a little overwhelmed. I smile coyly, breathing a little erratic. He swallows, before licking what he can from around his swollen lips, some dripping off his face and down his chin. He's a mess, looks so good I almost wish I could take a picture for future use. From the corner of my eye I watch him pad over to the kitchen. I steadily come down from my physical high, but I still want more. I turn to look at him, wiping his face off with a kitchen tea towel, and I realize we're still in an open area. Time for the bedroom. It takes me a second to speak to him, \"I'm gonna fuck you now, leave those socks on.\" He smiles, biting his lip in response and I watch his hips sway as he saunters over to me. I pick him up and walk to his door, nudging it open with his feet. I toss him gently on his bed and he laughs, soft and cute. Making sure to both close and lock the door, I quickly rid myself of my shirt and look over at him again. He's on his back with his legs open and slightly raised. Inviting. He slides the underwear down past his thighs and down his sock covered calves, tossing them to the floor. I'm immediately hard again. What time was I supposed to be at Tommy's? I realize I'm staring. \"Gonna fuck me?\" He's smug. Oh hell yes. There's nothing I'd rather do. \"You've been good enough.\" He breathes in deeply, and his eyes don't look away from me as he leans back on his pillows. Message is clear: \"I want you\". Who am I to say no? He's submissive and easily pliable. I spread his legs further apart and kneel between them. I wonder if he'll let me lick him out. Admittedly, I really like doing it to him, but he rarely let's me. He's usually shy about it but I don't think he'll be too shy tonight. I lean my head down between his legs and lick the inner part of his thigh. I gently suck on that spot, squeezing his hips and he moans into his pillow. I trail my tongue up his thigh and he squirms a bit more. I push one leg around my neck and put his other leg to his chest, and tentatively lick around his opening. He lets out a sort of whine, but doesn't immediately push my head away like normal, so I continue. I squeeze his inner thighs as I lap at his entrance. I try to test my luck, and push my tongue inside a little, curling it up, and he buries his face into his pillow again. I hear him gasp softly when I roughly grab his ass. God you're adorable Daniel. I go for a few more minutes until he's whimpering and shaking and making far too much noise not to be heard through the thin walls. \"Ah, ah, Johnny...?\" I stop and lift my head. \"Yes?\" \"Please, please just fuck me already.\" He can have whatever he likes at this point, I'm not going to decline. I get rid of my undone jeans and I feel him tug at my briefs. I can vaguely feel his heartbeat when I'm pressed this close. I attempt to discreetly spit into my hand, rubbing it on myself as I kiss him. My gaze lingers on that thick leather around his neck, and I think for a moment. Is that thing real? Where does someone even purchase this without a valid I.D.? How would he...? You know what fuck it. I figure can question him about his shopping habits after I'm done fucking his brains out. I line myself up at his wet entrance and put his legs on my shoulders, gently pushing myself inside, and he moans so loud I'd be surprised if nobody heard. \"Mmhnn...\" Little noises but no words. \"Naughty naughty tease you are, was this your plan all along? To have me fuck you like this?\" \"Mmmh... Ah-h!\" I change positions slightly so that I'm leaning over him, nice and close. The angle has his face slightly scrunched. \"Feel good?\" This isn't a confirmation so much as it is a prompt to get dirty talk out of him. \"Yeah,\" I feel him dig his nails into my ribs as his voice comes out breathy and quiet, \"Oh Johnny please, harder...\" I groan , oh gladly . I just want him to beg. Feigning innocence, I ask him, \"I'm sorry, what was that?\" Still being moved back and forth, he bites his lip, smiling a little. \"C'mon...\" As I slow down my movements, his hips start to move in an attempt to regain the pace I had. He whimpers and I know I've won. \"Ugh, Johnny please, faster! Come on you brat, move !\" Despite his quasi-insult, I grant his request, doubling my efforts as he mewls out in delight. I lean down and devour his mouth, playing with his tongue. More noises from him, more constant now. He's too good of a combination, innocent and seductive. I pull back and admire him a little bit, and he arches his head back as I pound into him. \"Oh god, Johnny.\" God I love hearing my name like that. \"You're so goddamn tight. This feel okay still?\" I was close to losing it, but his face was ambiguous and I didn't wanna be hammering away and unknowingly hurting him. \"Yeah, I um... ah!\" \"What, baby?\" He blushes a bit, gaze lowering. \"I can feel you,\" –his hand goes to his lower stomach– \"here.\" He's small enough that I'm not surprised by it. He certainly doesn't look like he's hurting though, so I keep going at it. I'm in a mood for more talk; it's incredibly arousing to hear it come from him. \"You want me to make you come?\" \"Yesyesyes\" he's slurring his words together. \"Tell me, beg for it.\" I play with the D-rings on his collar. I tug it back against his neck, just enough so it's a little hard to breathe. A slightly strangled cry comes from his mouth. \"Ugh, Johnny please, please!\" I feel his legs tighten around my hips, those little socks are soft against my skin. He moans again, needy and loud. \"Please what? Say it, Daniel.\" \"Please make me come, please I need it. I'm so fucking close, let me come, please!\" I comply without saying anything. I lower my head to his chest, gently sucking and nibbling at the skin, paying special attention to his nipples. I know he likes it despite never asking for it, and when I gently bite down I hear him squeal, and my name is screamed again. The increased pace is making me sweat. We're going at it so hard the headboard is hitting against the wall. He's probably going to be a little sore after this considering I've never fucked him this rough before. A few minutes into it and he's moaning loud enough to put porn stars to shame; I attempt to hush him a bit. I really, really hope his neighbors don't say anything. There is no way they can't hear us. I feel somewhat guilty, this probably sounds even worse to whoever lives below him. The bed is squeaking and the general skin on skin noises that usually accompany rough sex are especially audible. I moan loudly as I feel him bite at my collarbone, \"Fuck, you feel so good, I'm not gonna last much longer...\" I gasp as he suddenly tugs on my hair harshly, and I suddenly feel him get tight around me. \"Ah, ah! Fuck I'm gonna come, please don't st-o-oop! Don't stop!\" I have no intention of doing such a thing. \"Good boy Daniel, come for me, go on baby.\" Eyes squeeze shut as he writhes below me and I feel him squeeze me tightly. He suddenly arches into me, hands digging into my shoulders as his legs struggle to remain propped up on my shoulders. I keep pounding into him as he moans my name softly, trembling beneath me, and it all gets to be a little too much all the sudden. Oh god, I can't- \"Oh fuck! \" My orgasm comes on so strong I actually start to shake a bit, and I think for a moment I might pass out from the head rush. Daniel is whimpering below me, riding out his orgasm. I shove myself as far in as his body will let me, hearing him gasp softly as I come inside him, my hands gripping tightly to his shoulders as my face goes to his neck. My mouth remains open as I try to take in more air. I can feel his chest rise and fall, breathing deeply in his afterglow as his legs fall to my hips. After a few moments I gently pull out of him and I already miss the feeling. I don't get off him just yet though, and I take the time to admire him this close with his face inches from mine, a tired little smile on his face, eyes all glazed over in post-orgasm bliss. \"You're so amazing.\" He says it in a way that makes me smile stupidly big. He's looking at me admirably and I glow with pride. Good, I'm the only one who can make him feel this way. \"Please keep that outfit.\" He smiles his little sweet smile, a light blush over his face as I press a small kiss to his nose. I'll have to make up some convincing excuse to Tommy for ditching his party. I'm sure he'll understand anyway. Tending to your boyfriend's needs is highly important after all, relationship maintenance and all that. He leans up and presses a soft kiss to my jaw,. This was the right thing to do.

His head was both spinning and throbbing and it took all his will power to concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other and actually make his way to where his sensei was standing without planting pathetically on his face. Again . Death before dishonour. That was the Cobra Kai way. Wasn't it? All of a sudden he couldn't remember. All he could focus on was what was right in front of his eyes and the sound of his teammates calling him names. He deserved that, it was no doubt. To let a twerp like LaRusso get the drop on him like that was just disgraceful. He deserved the ridicule and the tongue lashing that came his way. His head hurt more than his face and he could see the smudge of red on his fingertips when he swiped it under his nose. His sensei's fingers were hard and calloused and rough when they wiped away the rest of the blood. His eyes were cold and steely and never had Johnny felt like a disappointment than he did at that moment. \"Sweep the leg,\" he said and for a moment, Johnny couldn't understand what his sensei was saying or what he meant. He was desperately trying to focus on his face and his lips moving because his ears were ringing something terrible and he couldn't concentrate on the man's words. \"Do you have a problem with that?\" In that moment Johnny knew that he truly had lost his sensei's trust. The trust that he'd painstakingly built and the respect he fought so desperately for… gone. In that moment he was no longer his sensei's best student, he was just another disappointment among many disappointments. He had nothing to lose. \"No mercy,\" his sensei said, his eyes steely and his voice cold. No mercy , Johnny repeated inside his head. That was the Cobra Kai way. His head was spinning and his eyes couldn't concentrate anything that wasn't in his immediate line of sight. He moved on instinct alone, his sensei's voice echoing like a resonating chant inside his mind. No mercy. No mercy. No mercy. Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy. That was the Cobra Kai way. He had nothing more to lose, not the trust of his sensei or the respect of his teammates. He could feel the heat of Dutch's glare on the back of his head and it only reminded him that this was his last shot; his only shot. There were no second chances in Cobra Kai. You could only be a winner, runner up was a joke. Anything other than a win was a humiliating loss. It didn't matter if you lost by one point or by twenty. Whether you lost to the best in the tournament or an annoying worm like LaRusso. A loss was a loss and this was his last shot to make everything right again. His nose was throbbing and his head was spinning; his eye could see double of everything and the last thing he needed was two of LaRusso. One was enough trouble as it was. He needed to win. He needed this win and he was going to get it no matter what. Fair play and integrity – those weren't philosophies Cobra Kai taught, and up until that match, watching LaRusso take hit after devastating hit and keep going; keep persevering and getting back up against all odds; the tenacity he showed – that was the first time Johnny actually questioned whether everything he'd been taught was right. And to have Kreese even ask that of him, such a gutless move in front over every fighter he looked up to and respected, it showed that his sensei didn't trust his ability at all. Maybe he never did. Johnny hated to admit it, but it hurt. More than any kick ever would. But he did it and he could only watch as LaRusso dragged himself back up to his feet again. That was the moment that it truly really sunk in for Johnny. He was going to lose. The elbow to the back of the knee really was just his last ditch effort. When it failed; when LaRusso got back up again, that was the moment he felt an eerie sense of acceptance washing over him like a frothing tide lapping at the shore – like the beach he used to go with Ali. He couldn't help but remember when Ali used to say his name with fondness instead of scathing hatred. When the things she said didn't always come out so cold. He missed those times but he had only himself to blame for letting her slip out of his grasp. Right into LaRusso's awaiting arms. He had only himself to blame. For Ali, for sensei, for his mom being stuck in a loveless marriage with an unkind, emotionally abusive man. That was all on him. It was his fault. He deserved the loss just like he deserved to lose Ali, just like his sensei deserved a better student and his mom deserved a better son; one who wasn't such a pathetic loser. That was it. It was truly the end. He was spent, not so much his physical energy but everything else. He was going to lose and despite the reality of the situation closing in on him while he had his back to an immovable wall, on the inside, he was at peace with it. He was going to lose, but that was okay because that was what he deserved. That was all he deserved. His head was throbbing, his eyes were dipping in and out of focus and whatever blurry thing he could even see was spinning wildly in his sight. He didn't even see the kick coming straight at his face. The velocity of the kick coupled with the fact that he was rushing headlong into it snapped his head back. He could feel the impact and the sound was almost like a hypnotizing whoosh which was a strange thing to notice but it was the only thing he could focus on in the moment before the surreal feeling of disembodiment and then just darkness. He was out cold before he even hit the mat. The moment the kick landed. The moment Johnny Lawrence dropped to the ground; a thick, stunned silence seized the entire arena. No one could believe what they were seeing; that the skinny kid from nowhere had toppled the titans of the All Valley tournament, the feared Cobra Kais. He'd defeated all the veteran members one by one against everyone's expectations and done what very few had ever managed to do: bring the two time champion Johnny Lawrence to his knees. The explosion of sound that followed was deafening. It was only the presence of the officials and the referees that prevented the crowd from engulfing the stage to offer their congratulations to the new champ. Only the members of LaRusso's corner and his mother were allowed access. The feeling of euphoria was palpable and the excitement in the air was contagious from one person to the next. However, as the crowd began noticing the referee kneeling over Johnny who was still on the ground, lying unmoving on his stomach; a hand on the small of his back, the noise and the chatter slowly began seeping away until the heavy silence reined once more. The final nail in the coffin was when the referee straightened up and with a frantic motion of his arm, called for the medics who were standing at the ready on the sidelines. That was the second time Johnny hit the mat during the tournament, and only the fifth time in his entire competitive career. But it was the first time he didn't get back up again. Tbc.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: One Day Time Will Tell Every single person in the entire four hundred people capacity arena held their breaths for fear of disrupting the medics who were converged on the still motionless contestant. The Cobra Kais were hovering close, a few kneeling down seemingly in prayer, watching the medics as they diligently worked on their fallen friend. John Kreese knelt down by Johnny's side, a hand hovering close to his shoulder without actually touching him; his usually hard, emotionless face was actually showing cracks, glimpses of concern and even a hint of fear breaking through the stoicism. At the far end of the stage stood Daniel LaRusso and his supporters, looking ashen and in pain, only half of which was because of his injured knee. His eyes were gazing transfixed at his motionless opponent, his mother and Ali whispering comforting words to him and squeezing his shoulder in reassurance but he wasn't heeding any of the support. Mr. Miyagi was standing silent by his side though his eyes were devastated, surveying the scene. The crowd started murmuring amongst themselves though not one person was able to tear their eyes away from the stage. Johnny had not stirred even a fraction since he hit the mat and even the stoic, stern looking referee assisting the medics was looking concerned. From somewhere down the hall there was the muffled sound of sirens of the ambulance nearing the front entrance of the arena. The Cobra Kais were pacing around the convergence of medics, referees and their sensei surrounding Johnny like a flesh and blood barrier. Bobby could barely hold back his emotions at the sight of his friend looking so helpless. After the incident with Daniel he'd tossed his belt at his sensei's feet and stormed out. He barely made it out the building before all the pent up emotions, the disappointment at his sensei and at himself washed over him like a wave, sending him staggering to his knees in absolute devastation. Karate had been the one thing he'd been the proudest of, the acclamation he'd achieved all on his own. And it was all over in a split second. It was Jimmy who came running out in alarm to find him, telling him that Johnny had been hurt. Bobby hadn't been too concerned at first. They'd all been hurt before; pulled tendons, bloodied noses, broken bones, dislocated shoulders; it was pretty much a given considering they dedicated their lives to getting kicked in the face. The severity of the situation only sunk in once he made it back into the fight arena, following Jimmy at a less urgent pace and was greeted by the stifling silence and the concerned murmurs and the sight of his own sensei kneeling over Johnny looking worried. He picked up his pace then and jogged up to join the rest of his team on the stage. He immediately gravitated towards Dutch, who despite his earlier feelings of anger and resentment towards him and Johnny for making it to the semi-finals was looking as scared as Bobby had ever seen him. \"What happened?\" he asked immediately when he reached. \"He took a full force kick to the face,\" Dutch said, chewing the nail of his thumb the way he only did when he didn't know what else to do with his hands; right arm propped up on his left that he had circled around his midsection. \"He's been out for almost three minutes.\" \"Jesus,\" said Bobby. \"LaRusso did that?\" he asked, and immediately regretted even mentioning the name. Dutch bristled like a cat the mention. \"Who the hell else could it be? What's that amateur even thinking attempting that goddamn move?\" Bobby was on the verge blurting out that they'd pulled their fair share of shitty moves on the guy as well. He wasn't at all saying that Johnny deserved to be hurt because of it, but at the same time, he couldn't stop thinking that it was karma on the lot of them. The last thing he wanted was his friend to be injured, but LaRusso definitely didn't deserve the way they treated him either. He wisely kept his mouth shut. Another team of paramedics jogged up to the stage and the Cobra's stepped back to make room for them. The assembled team had managed to carefully roll Johnny onto his back. There were so many people around him that the only part Bobby could see of Johnny was his legs. The feeling of uneasiness was heavy around him and Bobby could feel his heart pounding in his chest. Beside him Dutch had moved onto the rest of his fingernails which was a sign that he was really anxious. A glance behind him showed LaRusso being comforted by his mom and Ali, his eyes were red and glistening and in that moment Bobby couldn't find it in him to blame the guy for what happened. He did what he had to do to survive , not even to win. He did what any Cobra Kai would do: strike first, strike hard, show no mercy – even if that last part had happened by pure accident. It had barely been a few minutes since he reentered the arena into the heavy silence but it already felt like a lifetime. No one said a word but they all feared the same thing. The fact that Johnny had been completely knocked out. The fact that he hadn't moved even an inch since he went down. The fact that their own sensei and all the officials seemed so worried. No one dared to say the words aloud but they were all thinking the same thing. Broken neck. Bobby prayed for it not to be true. He could hear the sound of Jimmy and Tommy sniffling beside him. Tommy had been uncharacteristically silent since he arrived which wasn't really surprising considering the direness of the situation. Out of them all, Bobby was the closest to Johnny on a personal level. He knew things about Johnny that he would never tell the others for fear of appearing weak; about his home life and his stepdad; about his break up with Ali and how torn up he really was about it; about his fear about the uncertainty of the future. He talked to Bobby because he knew Bobby understood how he felt and that he emphasized with his fears. He told Bobby those things because he knew Bobby would never use his words against him. He confided in Bobby because he considered Bobby a good friend and Bobby did his best to be worthy of the precious trust he'd somehow earned. Johnny didn't trust people often and the fact that he trusted Bobby was something he wore like a badge of honour. Dutch both loathed and loved Johnny in the same breath which made him the worst and the best kind of friend a person could ever ask for. He respected Johnny as a friend and as a rival and the thing that drove him as a martial artist was his drive to best Johnny in a match. They'd joined Cobra Kai at the same time and rose to greatness at the same time, but somehow, the one opponent Dutch had never yet been able to defeat in a one on one match was Johnny. The person Dutch considered his closest friend was also his biggest rival. Bobby knew that, Johnny knew that – everyone knew that, it was common knowledge and Kreese only ever fueled the rivalry. But Dutch proved time and time again to be a loyal friend first and foremost and ultimately that was the only thing that mattered. Jimmy and Tommy both looked up to Johnny; in reverence almost, especially Jimmy who was one of their newer and less experienced members and Johnny looked out for him when he first moved there from some tiny suburban area with his parents and their white collar jobs. He was bully fodder from the moment he stepped foot into their school and luckily for him he ended up on the right side of Johnny and the Cobras. Tommy on the other hand stepped foot into their dojo one day, imprinted on Johnny and Dutch and just made himself complete comfortable in their inner circle. Both of them were looking on, absolutely terrified. It felt like time was standing still. He was sure hours must have passed them by without getting any sort of news about Johnny's condition but a glance at the giant clock on the wall showed him that it had barely been five minutes. He focused his attention back on Johnny, finding his sensei now standing beside the group of medics, giving them room but still keeping close and keeping watch over his student. And then all of a sudden movement out of the corner of his eyes snapped his attention to the present and his eyes turned just in time to see Johnny's legs move. The movement was weak but restless, like he was trying to find his footing but unable to get his feet under him to stand up. The relief among the Cobra Kais when they too finally noticed was palpable. There was a collective exhale among everyone present. Even his sensei closed his eyes for a moment in obvious relief, as if to recalibrate his emotions and school the worry in his heart. One of the medics reached around and placed a hand on Johnny's thigh, gently pushing his legs down to keep them from thrashing around. Johnny did have one hell of a mean kick. Eventually a couple of the medics finally straightened up and reached around for the backboard, sliding it into position. Bobby just watched as various hands carefully and gently rolled Johnny onto his side as the stiff backboard was slid under him. Only then was Bobby finally able to get a glimpse of Johnny. His eyes were open, Bobby noticed with great relief, though he seemed far from lucid. His fingers were furling and unfurling agitatedly where they were lying on his chest almost like he was attempting to massage feeling back into them; his arms and legs strapped tight to the board. His neck was held immobile by a stiff brace and a strap across his forehead securing his whole head to the board. \"You're okay, Johnny!\" Tommy yelled out in encouragement. \"This is nothing!\" Bobby appreciated the way Tommy's encouraging words could always come across as a bit of a threat, but he supposed that was what made the guy so endearing. Even from afar he could still see the fear shining in Johnny's eyes and to his surprise, his sensei actually reached over to take Johnny's hand, holding onto it tight. He didn't say anything, but he his gaze was slightly less cold when he looked down at Johnny and Bobby could see the way Johnny grasped on, accepting in the silent support his sensei was offering him. The wave of relief that spread among the spectators was felt even from the stage and as the paramedics carefully lifted Johnny up, carrying him off the stage and out of the arena into the waiting ambulance, resounding applause of encouragement followed his exit. The Cobras trailed after Johnny for as far as they could which was up to the doors of the ambulance parked out front. \"Stay strong, Johnny,\" someone said and the rest chimed in their support. Johnny couldn't turn his head to look at their assembled group but Bobby saw the tendril of a smile grace his lips at the comment. \"We'll be right here, man,\" Bobby said, finally able to find his voice, and reached over to pat Johnny on the shin. Dutch stayed strangely quiet beside him. Finally Johnny was loaded into the ambulance; Sensei Kreese rode along with him while the other Cobras could only stand there in the dust listening to the sound of sirens disappear into the distance. Tbc.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: When You're the One That's Standing There Win at any cost. That was the Cobra Kai way. That was his way. He was the one who created the discipline, the one who cultivated it and taught it. The one who made it into an art form. Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy. The method was simple. Win at any cost, that was what he always taught his students. No cost was too great. But he was wrong. There was a cost that was too great, and it was a price he was nearly forced to pay. He had noticed how dilated Lawrence's pupils were after the first hit and the way he was barely able to cover the stumble in his step when he was walking towards him but he'd brushed it off as a minor inconvenience. He was a Cobra, he'd walk it off. He should have stopped the match when his gut told him too – when the sight before his eyes morphed from a karate arena into a war torn battlefield. When the sight of his students turned into his brothers in arms fighting at his side against an enemy they had no chance of defeating – when Lawrence lying motionless on the stage was instead a fallen brother lying in a filthy sodden ground in a pool of his own blood. He realized in that moment that losing wasn't the same as loss and in his effort to prevent the first, he almost suffered the latter. Sometimes winning did come at a cost – for him it was at the cost of his conscience and his soul. Losing always came at a cost and for him it was one he was still paying to this day while attempting to drown out the noise of his memories with alcohol during the nights when the pain was especially potent. \"I'm sorry, sensei,\" Lawrence said, unable to do anything other than stare up at the ceiling of the ambulance. Every fiber of his being seemed completely defeated and it had little to do with the actual loss. \"Sorry's are for losers,\" he responded. \"Are you a loser, Mr. Lawrence?\" \"No, sensei,\" Lawrence answered, choking back his emotions and the small sob bubbling up. \"Then there's nothing to be sorry for,\" he said. \"Yes, sensei.\" \"We're Cobra Kai. It'll take more than this to keep us down,\" he said. He'd never been much for pep talks. He was not beyond the occasional congratulatory display of approval, but only weak people and losers needed constant validation for achieving mediocrity and congratulations every time they managed to wipe their own ass. He never taught his students to strive for meaningless sentiments such as praise and compliments. So when a student showed enough gumption to be worthy of it, it would mean so much more. But even in his hardened, world-weary soul, he acknowledged that Lawrence needed encouragement, he needed validation and support in that moment. And he gave it as best he could. \"Yes… sensei,\" Lawrence said through the sob that forced its way out. A single tear trickled out the corner of his eye and down his temple, splashing onto the back board he was strapped securely onto. The tear represented everything he was feeling on the inside: the pain, the frustration and disappointment in himself – and the fear . Kreese couldn't find it in him to fault him for that. He'd felt the same sort of fear he never thought he'd ever experience again the moment Lawrence hit the mat and didn't get back up again. Instead, he reached over to pat him on the thigh as acknowledgement and an expression of support before leaning back to rest his back against the ambulance and crossing him arms over his chest. He finally exhaled. No fear . That was the Cobra Kai way, but that wasn't true, every human being feared something. For John Kreese, he nearly relived his greatest fear that day. There was a flurry of activity and muffled voices in the hall outside the waiting room before the group of Cobra Kais burst through the door about half an hour after the ambulance arrived at the hospital and Johnny was rushed into the emergency room. Bobby and Jimmy arrived another fifteen minutes after the group, having stopped by Johnny's house to pick up his mother and it was another hour or so before they were seen by the doctor treating Johnny and updated on his condition. \"He's okay,\" the doctor said immediately and it was the two words all of them needed to hear the most. Johnny's mom immediately sobbed in relief. Bobby stuck close to her, offering a shoulder to cry her emotions on which she accepted gratefully. He'd suffered a concussion as the result of the hit to the back of the head during the second round, exacerbated by the kick to the face almost immediately after that knocked him out. The result of the full force kick had also caused whiplash which, while wouldn't cause any long term problems, was not going to be a walk in the park to deal with for the next few months. Eventually Johnny's mom and their sensei left to follow the doctor to go see him, leaving the rest of the Cobras to finally slump down onto the chairs in relief. Everyone except Dutch. \"This is all his fault,\" he said angrily, cracking his knuckles almost obsessively as he paced up and down the room. \"That twerp. That weasely little rat, LaRusso. He's gonna pay for this.\" \"It's not his fault,\" Bobby responded immediately. No even looking up at Dutch when he answered. Dutch snapped around immediately at Bobby's comment, his expression a mix of anger and disbelief. \"Who the hell's side are you even on, Bobby? I always pegged you for a dweeb lover but not after what he did to Johnny. That's pathetic even for you.\" That time Bobby did look up, his brows narrowed and his gaze intense. \"You know what's pathetic? A group of five people beating up on one guy, that's what. No . A group of five experienced karate students beating up on a guy who couldn't defend himself. That's pathetic, Dutch!\" \"Am I even hearing you right right now?\" said Dutch with a laugh of disbelief. \"You're really going to sit there and defend the guy who almost broke our friend's neck ? What the hell is wrong with you?\" \"Me?\" Bobby scoffed, spitting the word like he couldn't believe Dutch had the balls to even say those words to him. \"The only thing wrong with me was that I just stood by and did nothing when I thought what you guys were doing was wrong. I love Johnny just as much as you do and I feel terrible about what happened. I'd never wish for that to happen to anyone – not even LaRusso, but don't pretend that we weren't the one who forced him into that corner,\" said Bobby, immediately getting to his feet when Dutch advanced on him threateningly. \"We… no, I could have crippled him permanently and for what ? So that sensei could have another trophy in his case? At the expense of my reputation and my self-respect! The better question is – what the hell is wrong you ?\" he jabbed a finger right in the middle of Dutch's chest accusingly. None of the Cobras had ever seen Bobby lose his temper like that and it silenced every single one of them including Dutch who was forced to take a step back by the ferocity of Bobby's jab. \"Our friend is in the hospital and the only thing you can think of is continuing with this pointless grudge match. The grudge match that landed us here in the first place!\" He turned his attention away from Dutch to address the entire team present. \"If anyone here lays so much as a finger on Daniel LaRusso from now on – they'll have to answer to me !\" He cast one last withering glare at Dutch and dropped back down onto the seat, crossing his arms over his chest as if challenging anyone to step up against him right then. If there was one thing Dutch respected, it was balls and it was clear by his expression that he thought Bobby showed a gigantic pair made of steel right then. \"You heard the man. No one touches the twerp,\" he said finally, backing away from Bobby before turning around to go lick his wounded pride at the far end of the room. Bobby could feel his heart pounding in his chest. The last thing he wanted to do was get into a fight with Dutch of all people, but he was done being the little pebble in the way that everyone stepped over to go do whatever the hell they wanted whenever the hell they wanted to do it. He was done being the resident doormat. If only he'd stood his ground against his friends back then, everyone might have stopped incessantly tormenting LaRusso; LaRusso might not have had to resort to doing those moves that were far beyond his capabilities and skill and Johnny might not have ended up in the hospital – or worse – because of it. If only . Tbc.

I haven't given up my John Kreese backstory but I just had an idea for a new story I wanted to try. This one will be set in the Cobra Kai universe and is post series 1. Jessica Grey walked through the front doors of her new high school. She had just moved into the valley with her mum. They had moved there shortly after her dad had died. Obviously Jess had taken it hard but had also learned how to block out the pain and walks into the school trying to look strong and confident. Jess was an attractive girl who was 6'2 and had jet black hair and her body looked healthy and strong. Jess was also a kind person who had time for everyone and in her old school had hung out with everyone from the nerds to the sports teams. She wasn't worried about making friends and wasn't going to act desperate to find any. Sam Larusso had also just walked into school. After the events of last year she promised herself she wasn't going to pretend to be someone she's not. She had given up Karate which she had always loved just because it seemed dorky to others, she had stayed away from her best friend just to hang out with prettier and more popular girls. But she had finally seen she was wrong and had gone back to who she was. She had started hanging out with Aisha again and had started Karate again. Now instead of spending weekends at parties she was at the dojo training or with Aisha. As she walks she notices a girl she had never seen before. She had heard a new girl was starting here. So Sam walks up to her to say hello. \"Hey are you new here?\" Sam asks in a kind and understanding voice. Jess turns to face her hearing this and eyes up the brown haired girl. Jess had always struggled to trust people but as she looked at Sam she was sure she seemed genuinely nice. \"Yeah just moved here from New York last week.\" She gives a small smile Sam smiles back. \"Ah that's cool I love New York we went there on holiday for Christmas a few years ago. How come you moved down here?\" Jess bit her lip. She didn't want to start a new friendship by lying to this girl who was making an obvious attempt to be nice but she also couldn't bring herself to say the truth. \"My mum just fancied a change of scenery.\" Sam nods noticing she doesn't mention her dad but doesn't bring it up. \"Well I hope you like it here. My names Sam by the way or Samantha. Whatever either works.\" She smiles at her. \"Nice to meet you I'm Jess.\" The 2 have the first 2 classes together and hang out and talk in between lessons. Jess was relatively smart and was able to keep up with the lessons. The next lesson was gym class and after they had gotten changed they waited around on the sports field with the rest of the class. They were just talking about random stuff and Jess was looking around at the class. She notices a small group of mostly guys and one girl. They seemed like a kind of gang. Jess was good at reading these situations and she guessed that the leader was this skinny Mexican kid with black hair and the second in command was this loud guy with a mowhawk. Sam sees where she's looking and rolls her eyes. \"Yeah stay away from those guys. They're a bunch of assholes. Well no that's unfair the girls really nice but the others are just horrible. Especially Miguel.\" Jess assumed Miguel was the one she had guessed as the leader. She also noticed Sam sounded angrier and more bitter than she had heard her yet. \"Ah okay. I'm sensing some tension there. Some um history between you 2?\" Sam looks at her and sighs. \"Yeah ex. He was nice at first but he got bullied a bit the stood up for himself but then he changed and became a jerk. Then one night at a party he got drunk and he hit me.\" Jess glares over at the guy called Miguel. \"What a dick. Just say the word and I'll go kick his ass.\" Sam laughed. Typical New York girl always ready to fight. She shakes her head. \"Nah it's all good. Sorry I made that sound a lot worse. He wasn't trying to hit me.\" Jess rolls her eyes. \"Oh he gave you that excuse did he? What will it be next time? It's your fault I'm doing this. Come on Sam I thought you were smarter.\" Sam shakes her head. \"No no it wasn't like that. He really wasn't trying to hit me. I was talking to this other guy. Just talking before you ask and he got jealous and Miguel tried to hit him and he caught me when I was trying to separate it. I guess it's not all his fault. I handled stuff badly.\" Jess shrugs and looks at her. \"Yeah maybe you did. But still whats that dumbass starting a fight without knowing the full story for?\" Sam just smiled at how ruthlessly blunt Jess was. \"Yeah I guess. They kind of did fight eventually. Miguel messed him up and fought dirty and targeted an injury that Hawk or Eli or whatever gave him.\" \"Wow yeah he is a dick. I'm guessing this Hawk is the one with the haircut.\" \"Yeah how did you know?\" \"Only a guy with that dumb haircut would call himself Hawk.\" Sam laughs again. Meanwhile Yasmine had just walked onto the sports pitch. Since that bitch Aisha had humiliated her at that party her reputation had gone severely downhill. Yasmine couldn't go anywhere without being reminded of that stupid video of her being lifted in the air by her underwear. She was determined to get some respect back. She was looking around and glares seeing her old friend Sam who had turned out to just as much a loser and a dork as that bitch Aisha. Her eyes then divert to the girl she's with. A new girl. The perfect opportunity to show everyone who's boss. Yasmine sneaks up on the pair. It was perfect. Sam was standing next to the new girl so wouldn't see her coming and hey if she got that Larusso bitch as well as new girl even better. She walks up to Jess and smirks and grabs Jess by her black underwear and yanks It up. The perfect way to get her reputation back by using the same humiliation she'd been given. Jess is shocked feeling her underwear pulled and lets out a short scream. Not a high pitched scared scream like Yasmine had but an angry and indignant scream. Her face reddens hearing the surrounding people laugh. When Yasmine releases her she immediately spins round and shoves her hard. \"Hey what the hell's your problem bitch?\" She yells. Suddenly everyone stopped laughing and was watching intently. Sam who Jess was grateful hadn't laughed walked in front of Jess. \"Yasmine leave her alone. This is her first day, she's done nothing to you just leave her.\" She almost begs. Yasmine laughs. \"Back off Sam unless you want the same.\" \"Yeah try it?\" she glares lifting her hands and shifting her legs into a fighting stance. \"aww you gonna use your daddys dorky Karate on me. I'm sooo scared.\" She says sarcastically and laughs. Jess glares and puts her hand on Sams arm and whispers. \"Thanks for the help but I can handle her.\" Jess steps in front of her. \"Yasmine is it? Aren't you the one that got throw into the air by the front of your panties by a girl you'd been bullying.\" She glances at the Cobra Kai group where Aisha was and who hadn't laughed and were all now watching interested. \"Yeah whatever that bitch cheap shotted me. She couldn't do it again.\" Jess smirked smugly and folds her arm. \"Cheap shot? Sam showed me the video. Looked to me she was standing in front of you and yet the one you just gave me you got me from behind so what do you call that? But anyway if you try to bully me it won't take me months to get you back and I'll do a lot worse than give you a wedgie are we clear?\" she says in a strong determined voice which makes the watching crowd react. Yasmine is slightly shocked for a second but recovers. \"Big words but I know you're not going to do shit all.\" She smirks and reaches to yank the new girls hair. As soon as Yasmines hand gets near Jess she instantly grabbed her wrist and twists it hard causing a yelp from Yasmine who stumbles to the side. As she stumbles Jess launches a perfectly executed front kick into Yasmines chest which sends her flying across the pitch and lands heavy on the floor. This causes an explosion of shock and cheers from the crowd. Sam steps back looking stunned. Jess leaves her side and slowly walks towards Yasmine. \"Look blondie I don't wanna fight you. Walk away now and this is over and you can save what reputation you have left.\" Yasmine staggers to her feet badly winded. She was out of her depth. She was not a physical bully. She used blackmail and insults and social media to bully people. She had only resorted to physical attacks out of desperation and was now paying for it. But now she had no choice. \"you're dead.\" She runs at Jess and throws a terrible punch which Jess blocks easily and almost at the same time as the block stops the punch Jess fires a straight punch direct into Yasmines nose. Jess fees it break as soon as it makes contact. Blood explodes from Yasmines face and gets in her blonde hair. Her eyes were watering but makes another charge. Jess had enough now and wanted to end it. She side steps her and sends a knee into her stomach which makes her double over then she a roundhouse kick which crashes into her head sending her crashing into the mud. Jess steps back holding her hands up in a passive position showing she didn't want to fight. She had held back her power on Yasmine so she wasn't knocked out which she should've been from a kick like that from. Yasmine staggers up. Her clothes were covered in both mud and her own blood so was her normally perfect face. Apart from the mud and blood her was now crooked from the first punch and bruises already forming and her make up running down her face because of her watering eyes. She looks round at the cheering crowd and runs away out the gate on the pitch. Jess ignores the cheers and walks back to Sam and gives her a small smile. \"Thanks for sticking up for me. Not many would do that for a new girl.\" \"Yeah well no problem but well I obviously didn't need to did i? Why didn't you tell me you do Karate?\" Jess shrugs. \"Why didn't you? Come on I saw that fighting stance. That's not just a stance that someone with no experience uses.\" Sam smiles and shrugs as well. \"Yeah okay fair enough guilty. But wow that was amazing. Hey I've got a dojo at home would you like to come round after school and maybe swap moves?\" Jess bit her lip again. She had wanted to put Karate in her past and didn't want to let anyone know she could fight. But that was never going to happen now and anyway wasn't some idiot meat head. She was kind and sweet and loyal. Willing to stand up for someone she'd just met. \"Yeah go on then. But hey don't expect me to take it easy on ya.\" She grins and winks. Sam smirks. \"As long as you don't expect that of me.\" She winks back. The teacher comes along and the lesson starts. After class the Cobra Kai gang were still pumped up from that fight. Aisha in particular loved watching her former bully get a beat down. \"That was so bad ass what she did. Damm I wish I'd gotten to do that instead of just a wedgie.\" Hawk was equally pumped up. \"Hell yeah new girl can throw her hands. She should so come to Cobrai Kai. Sensei would love her right Miguel? Oi earth to Miguel or is the champ not allowed to talk to us peasants?\" Miguel had been pumped up by the fight too but he had also Sam and the new girl glaring at him. She'd obviously filled her in on their history. \"Huh oh yeah sorry. That was cool she'd be a Cobra for sure. But she's friends with Sam. Sams probably told her how awful Cobra Kai is.\" Aisha shakes her head. \"She doesn't hate all of Cobra Kai. She's friends with me isn't she? She doesn't hate all Cobra Kai. She just hates Cobra Kai that get drunk and punch her in the face.\" Miguel groans. \"I told you that was an accident.\" Aisha nods. \"I know I believe you but doesn't mean she doesn't have the right to be pissed. Whatever I'm going to say hi to new girl.\" Jess and Sam were walking together when Aisha runs up to them. \"Hey Sam.\" Sam smiles at her. \"Hey Aisha sorry I haven't spoken to you today was just showing Jess around. This is Jess by the way.\" Jess gives a small wave. \"Hi I've heard a lot of good stuff from Sam. \"Yeah well I saw a lot of good stuff about you out there. You kicked Yasmines ass.\" Jess gives an embarrassed smile. \"Yeah but fighting on the first day. Not exactly the perfect start but anyway I know you're the one that truly put her down. That was brave of you standing up to a bully. I didn't know Yasmine she had never scared me or humiliated me. Well apart from the wedgie but I don't give a shit about that.\" Before Aisha could reply Miguel and Hawk join them. Sam glares and looks at the floor. Jess gives them both a look. Miguel talks first. \"Hi I'm Miguel this is Hawk.\" \"Yeah I know who you are.\" She says coldly. Miguel glances at Sam who looks embarrassed. \"Well um I just wanted those were some nice moves.\" Jess shrugs. \"It's easy to look good against some stuck up princess who couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag.\" Miguel could sense her hostility but she was talking to him so continued. \"What is it you do? Um is it like Karate or kickboxing or taekwondo?\" \"Karate.\" She says shortly. \"Oh that's cool me Hawk and Aisha we do Karate to. What dojo do you go to?\" \"I don't have a dojo.\" She answers shortly again wishing he'd leave them alone. \"Oh really? Well hey you could always come to ours?\" Sam snorts and glares at Miguel. Jess notices It and ignores her. She had no intention with someone like that but humoured him anyway. \"What dojo do you train with?\" Miguel smiles proudly as he says the name. \"Cobra Kai\" Jess stops dead and glares even more at him. \"I heard Cobra Kai died out years ago.\" Hawk smirks and decides to comment. \"Cobra Kai never die new girl\" Jess looked like she was about to punch Hawk. Sam looked at her confused as Jess snarls. \"I'd rather cut my throat then join Cobra Kai.\" Like Sam Miguel was confused by her anger. \"You know nothing about us.\" \"I know that Cobra Kai is full of bullying thugs who know nothing of honour or respect. They're a bunch of sadists who enjoy hurting people. Everything I've heard about you sounds exactly like what Cobra Kai is. A guy who punches his girlfriend because he's trying to fight a guy she dares to talk to. You make me sick.\" She storms off away from everyone. Later after school Jess runs up to Sam and smiles at her. \"Sorry I'm late everyone kept bugging me about that stupid fight. I'm surprised I haven't been pulled in about it from the teachers.\" Sam laughs and holds her hand. They start walking to her house. \"Yeah I doubt they'd care. The teachers hate Yasmine as much as we do.\" \"Well that's good to know. Look I'm sorry I stormed off before. I guess my adrenaline was still pumping after the fight and well I'm a bit of a mouthy bitch at the best of times.\" She gives a small laugh which Sam returns. \"Yeah I noticed. But um why are you so against Cobra Kai? I never even mentioned that name to you. How do you even know about them?\" Great now she had to lie to her friend again. \"I don't. But that dick Miguel seemed to be proud of them so I insulted it. That's all.\" Sam got the feeling she was lying but like the thing with her dad she didn't press it. They carry on walking to her house. Talking about random stuff and talking about the moves Jess used on Yasmine and what Sam would do different. They get to her house and Sam looks and sees her parents aren't home. She shrugs and walk into the family dojo. \"Wow this is awesome.\" Jess looks around the dojo and slips her shoes off automatically before she steps on the mat. She looks at the 2 large trophies. \"Nice are these yours?\" Sam laughs and rolls her eyes. \"Oh yeah because I'd be competing in the 84 and 85 under 18 all valley tournament wouldn't i?\" Jess looks closer and shrugs with a grin. \"Well hey you were certainly under 18 then.\" \"I was under 0 then. Nah they're my dads.\" Jess nods. \"Your dad the one that taught you?\" \"Yeah I stopped for a few years but started again after the last all valley.\" \"Why? You interested in going for it and winning one of these yourself?\" \"No no I don't care about competition but I realised I needed to train again.\" Jess figures something out. \"That guy you said Miguel fought dirty against. That was at the tournament?\" \"Yeah anyway hey lets do this. Um oh you need a gi. Hang on dad should have a spare in here. She pulls out a white gi from a cupboard and throws it to Jess. Then goes to a cupboard of belts. \"What belt are you?\" \"brown.\" Jess says as she changes into the gi and sam chucks a brown belt at her. \"Seriously with the skills you showed you should be black belt\" Jess shrugs and puts the belt on and waits for Sam to change into her own gi and puts her black belt on. Sam grins at her and steps on the mat. \"Ready?\" Jess grins back. \"Bring it.\" The 2 girls bow to each other and start to spar. Both were extremely skilled and Sam uses anumber of aerobic kicks. Jess blocks and returns with a series of punches and turns into a spinning back kick which hits sam just above the waist which sends her back a little. Sam smiles and nods and comes back and counters Jess's roundhouse kick with a sweep that makes Jess fall on the mat. Jess smirks at her and gets up. The 2 continue to spar at a high pace but both keeping control and not using any power capable of hurting the other. They were very evenly matched but in different ways. Jess struggled to break through Sams amazing defence and was kept on her toes but her aerobic kicks. Sam was struggling with the speed of attack coming at her and while Jess may not have as flashy kicks as Sam her speed and timing was outstanding. They continue to spar for a long both landing good shots but neither able to take advantage. Eventually they both come to an unspoken agreement to stop. They both bow to each other and burst out laughing and hug each other. Neither girl had faced as tough an opponent as the other. Sam beams her face covered in sweat. \"You're amazing you so should be a black belt.\" Jess had a big smile to and was also covered in sweat. \"I knew you knew karate but didn't expect you to be that good and you said you were rusty. If you were 100% you'd have beaten me.\" Sam shrugs. \"Hey who cares I wasn't sparing to beat you.\" \"Nah me neither damm that was fun.\" \"Hell yeah but hey you better wash that gi before you give it back you're sweating all over it.\" Sam laughs and Jess laughs back. \"You can talk Sammy.\" \"Yeah well this is my gi.\" \"Fair enough.\" The 2 girls laugh and Sam goes and gets 2 cans of coke and gives one to Jess. They both take off their belts and undo their gi tops and go and sit outside. Jess sips her drink and smiles. \"Your dad taught you well.\" Sam smiles. \"Thanks. Um can I ask who taught you? I'm sorry I don't want to be nosy I'm just curious. Jess sighs. She really liked Sam and just couldn't fully lie to her face. \"My dad taught me as well. He died a few months ago.\" She looks down. Sam sighs feeling terrible. \"I'm sorry I shouldn't have asked. It's not my business.\" Jess shakes her head. \"No its fine you're my friend I don't mind telling you. That's why we moved down here to.\" Sam nods. \"Yeah that's understandable. Look again i don't wanna be nosy. But what's your beef with Cobra Kai. I know it wasn't just to annoy Miguel. You seemed to know about them like not just the dojo that opened last year. The old one. Look Cobra Kai were the reason my dad started Karate they bullied him and beat him up. The first trophy in there was actually won by my dad by beating Cobra Kais current sensei. Sorry I'll shut up.\" Jess listens to the story then shakes her head. \"No it's fine. Yeah I knew of Cobra Kai way before I came here. I know about all the old school guys. Sensei lawerence who runs it now. I know about John Kreese, Terry Silver, Mike Barnes, Dutch, Tommy, Bobby all those guys. I also know about your dad beating them. But I only just realised it was your dad just now with the story. I should've recognised the name Larusso and the fact those trophies are from 84 and 85.\" Sam was looking genuinely confused. \"How do you know so much? Most of those names you said would be in their 50s or older by now.\" Jess sighed. \"I know them because of my dad. Please don't hate me for this,\" \"Hey I'd never hate you. You're like the only girl apart from Aisha who's into karate and your lovely and awesome. Your dad isn't you so come on what Is it?\" Jess sighs again. \"I know so much because…My style originated from Cobra Kai. My dad's Sensei was John Kreese. He was Cobra Kai… A/n: Wow didn't expect to write so much for this but I just got really into it. I hope people enjoyed my story. I tried to do justice to the characters but not sure if they were good enough. I've got some plans for this story. I'd love any feedback you guys want to give me. I really enjoyed writing this so I will carry it on. But please please review and any criticisms I'm happy to hear. I know Johnny and Daniel weren't in this but they will be in the future. Thanks for reading.[Chapter 2] \"Your dad was Cobra Kai?\" Sam asks. She didn't seem angry or upset just a bit confused. Jess sighs and nods. \"Yeah for 10 years from when he was 6.\" \"But that doesn't make sense I mean 2 reasons. 1 you fight nothing like the other Cobra Kai. I mean you used a lot of defence when we fought. Cobra Kai is more aggressive.\" Jess nods. \"Yeah well I put in a few things myself into my style and so did my dad. He quit before I was born.\" Sam shrugs and nods as she was absently playing with her gi. \"Okay makes sense I guess. But the second thing is. If your dad was part of them then why do you hate them so much? Jess sighs and looks down as she talks. \"My dad started training with Kreese when he was 6. My dad was good but he was never part of his all-star team. He got his black belt like a year after Lawrence and that lot. He never really fit in with those guys either. Probably because he went to a different school. But still my dad followed their ways. I mean he wasn't a bully but if anyone messed with him he'd seriously hurt them. He was constantly in trouble with the school and the police. I'm surprised he never got locked up. But anyway when he was 16 he met my mum. She calmed him down and softened him up. He realised how bad he'd been and what Kreese had turned him into. He promised her he would change but he couldn't quit on Kreese he was still loyal and loved Karate. But anyway my dad entered a local tournament. Not the All Valley dad was never allowed to enter that one but it was a smaller one. Dad got to the finals but he didn't have the same no mercy attitude he had before. His opponent had hurt his ribs in a previous match and obviously Kreese told him to target them. But dad couldn't do it and went for anywhere but the ribs and well dad lost 3-1. After that he knew he couldn't be part of Cobra Kai anymore.\" Sam listened to the story with interest and gave her a kind smile. \"Hey that's not so bad. I mean okay your dad did some bad stuff when he was younger but he grew and learned from it and taught you to be better. I still don't get why you hate them so much.\" Jess sighs. \"I haven't finished the story yet after the tournament dad and Kreese had a massive argument. Dad told him what he thought of Cobra Kais methods. Apparently Kreese calmed down then told him to come to the dojo that night so they could sort him leaving. Dad went there and it was a set up. Kreese had his 3 top guys there. Lawrence, Dutch and Tommy and Kreese himself. Kreese made them fight dad. Also not one at a time all 3 attacked him at once full force.\" Sam gasps and covers her mouth. \"Oh my god that's horrible.\" \"Yeah I mean dad was good but he couldn't hold off 3 guys with the same training. Then Kreese joined in. They put him in the hospital. His leg was smashed to pieces, his was a mess, jaw broken, teeth knocked out, nose and ribs broken. Dad was never the same again. I never saw my dad healthy. All my life he had to take pain killers and medicine so he could breathe properly. Thing is dad never blamed the 3 he said they were all under Kreeses spell but that's bullshit they make their own choice. But anyway dad was bitter against Cobra Kai but he started training me when I was 7. At first he taught me full Cobra Kai way he said that if people would attack with that mentality I had to defend with that mentality. I listened but then I got into a fight at school and knocked this boy out hard. I felt terrible and I told dad this and he realised he was wrong to teach me that way. At first I didn't know all this I mean I didn't care Karate was just a cool game. But after he told me this and I researched Cobra Kai I saw what they were and was ashamed and wanted to quit but dad convinced me to keep training and we both worked on my defence more, worked on my counter attack. But dads injuries just kept hurting more over the years. He had to take more and more medicine. I guess he couldn't take it anymore. One day me and mum came home and found him dead from an overdose of pain medication.\" She takes a deep breath and looks down trying to hide her tears from Sam who was also close to tears. She puts her arm round her. \"Oh my god Jess I am so sorry I can't even imagine how horrible that is.\" \"That's why I hate them so much. Cobra Kai killed my dad. Maybe not straight away but I they hadn't beaten him he'd never have had those injuries and he wouldn't have killed himself.\" Sam nods and speaks in a soft gentle voice. \"Hey I totally get it. My god they really are sick and one of the guys who did it Lawrence is now teaching kids. That's sick.\" \"Yeah I know. I really to go there and confront the asshole tell him what he did. But I was to scared. That's also why I never told you I did Karate I was ashamed.\" Sam looks at her confused. \"Ashamed of what? You've done nothing wrong.\" \"My style is Cobra Kai. I may have some more blocks but my base is Cobra Kai. What if I'm like the rest of them. What if I'm like what my dad was.\" Sam shakes so fast her hair whips in her face. \"Don't talk nonsense. Listen I haven't even known you for 24 hours yet but you are not like them. It's not the actual Karate that's bad. It's the mentality its taught with. Really the whole style isn't much different to my style. Its just their taught to be aggressive. It's the student that matters not the style. I mean maybe you had the aggressive training but you felt bad after hurting someone. Those other guys wouldn't feel bad. Your dad didn't target an injury. They would have. Listen Jess if you were Cobra Kai you'd have pounded Yasmine into the mud. But you didn't you just defended yourself and stepped back when you knocked her down. I also saw you weren't using full strength. A Cobra wouldn't have done that. If you were you'd have killed her as soon as she gave you that wedgie. Also when we were sparring we both didn't use full power and we were both smiling and laughing when we were fighting. A Cobra would've tried to kill me as soon as we started. You also backed off when you tripped me. They wouldn't. Jess you're a good person you're nothing like them.\" Jess smiled at her. \"Thank you you're a good friend.\" \"You're welcome and hey my dads just opened up the dojo for our style and you're welcome to join.\" She smiles at her. Jess smiles back. \"Yeah sure sounds cool.\" \"Oh..um ah sorry look there might be a problem. You may not like this. The guy Miguel hurt and um dads student it's um Johnny Lawrences son.\" Jess eyes widen a little. \"Oh well now I don't feel so bad he got hurt.\" She shrugs \"Anyway why are you hanging out with that kind of guy?\" \"No honestly he's not like his dad. In fact he hates his dad maybe even more than you do. He's not like him I swear.\" Jess shrugs. \"Yeah you're right I'm sorry I can't judge him based on his dad. Anyway we should get changed.\" The next day they meet up and walk to school together. The first thing of the day was a school assembly. Jess and Sam sit near the back. As the head teacher comes up to speak. \"So everyone today we have a special treat. These people are here to give us a demonstration of their abilities. We're proud to welcome the All Valley Karate champions the Cobra Kai.\" \"You've got to be kidding.\" Sam whispers as 8 members of Cobra Kai including Miguel, Hawk and Aisha run onto the stage in their black sleeveless gis chanting Cobra Kai then stand to attention facing the crowd as the head teacher continues talking. \"And their sensei. Former champion Sensei Johnny Lawrence.\" Johnny walks onto the stage with a smirk on his face. Sam quickly glances at Jess who was glaring at Johnny and looked like she wanted to run at him. Sam put her hand on hers. \"Hey relax don't let them get to you.\" Jess glances at her and gives a small nod and Johnny starts talking. \"Whats up everyone. We're the Cobra Kai. The most bad ass karate school in the Valley. We take wimps and make them winners. I'm always looking for new guys to turn from pussies and nerds into some bad ass Cobras. So if you wanna learn to kick ass and get some hot babes come join up.\" Sam and Jess roll their eyes at his comments which had caused some laughter from the crowd as he continues. \"But hey im not just shit talking about my guys I wanna prove it. If anyone wants to challenge my students a match then step up.\" There was silence in the hall. Johnny looks smug no one wanted to mess with his students which makes Jess even angrier and she stands up. \"I'll fight them.\" Sam grabs her hand and whispers. \"No don't Jess sit down.\" Jess ignores her and pulls away and walks up to the stage and stands in front of the man who crippled her father. \"Lets see how good your Cobra scumbags really are.\" Johnny smirks at the girls personality. \"Okay girl you wanna throw down. You can fight Aisha.\" \"No I don't wanna fight her I've got nothing against her. Give me that douche bag with the stupid hair cut or the girl beater champion.\" Hawk glares and runs forward. \"I'll fight that bitch sensei.\" Johnny just shrugs. \"Whatever but don't come trying to sue my ass when you get hurt.\" Jess gives a sarcastic smile. \"Make sure he doesn't do the same when I knock his mowhawk off.\" Jess faces off with Hawk and Johnny yells begin. Hawk flies at her with a superman punch which Jess ducks under and sweeps out Hawks leg sending him to the floor. Miguel and Aisha glance at each other. They knew how good Jess was and was worried about Hawk. Hawk jumps up and flies at her with attacks she defends and hits him with a side kick sensing him crashing into Johnny who glares and catches him. \"What the fuck hawk? Your fighting like you're trying to kill this girl. Just trip her and put her on her ass. Jesus Christ I don't want this kid dead.\" \"Don't worry sensei I got this bitch. No mercy.\" Johnny sighs. He seriously needed a word about the meaning of no mercy. Hawk runs at her again with a bunch of attacks. He eventually connects with a punch on her nose which snaps her head back causing gasps from the crowd. Sam covers her mouth and Johnny mutters. \"Fuck sake Hawk\" to himself. Even Hawk realised he'd taken it to far and hesitated looking concerned. Jess wiped the blood from her nose and flew at Hawk in a rage. Firing every punch and kick she knew at him. Shhe connects with a kick to the groin then follows with a knee to the head which drops Hawk. But Jess was angry now and jumps on his and continues pounding him. She quickly sees what she's doing and stops. She quickly gets off him. She felt awful. She had just shown everyone especially Sam. She really was just like them. Hawk gets up slowly looking at her nervously. Jess bows to him and runs over. \"I'm so sorry. That went too far are you okay?\" Hawk nods. \"It's fine I deserved it I'm sorry about the punch. Sensei told me not to go mad and I didn't listen. I'm sorry.\" He walks over to Johnny. \"I'm sorry sensei. I don't know what happened to me. I'm gonna take some time out.\" Johnny nods. He knew Hawk had lost it. Probably his fault for taunting him to much when he first joined up. He quickly looks at his team. \"Diaz okay you're up fight her.\" Miguel knew he couldn't he wasn't afraid but people knew him as a girl basher for hitting Sam he couldn't fight a girl in front of everyone. \"No Sensei.\" \"Hey don't be a pussy Diaz fight her.\" Jess glares listening to the way he was talking to his students. Everything that had happened including her anger was all because of that man in front of him and there was only one way to stop it. \"No fuck Diaz there's someone else I wanna fight.\" Johnny threw his hands up and shrugged. \"Okay whatever. Who?\" \"You I want to fight you.\" Johnny and everyone else looked stunned. \"Oh Shit.\" Sam mutters to herself as Jess glares at Johnny. \"What's the matter Sensei you too much of a pussy to fight a teenage girl? Or do you need to call your buddies to help you fight me?\" To Be Continued. A/N: Hope you guys liked it. I was tempted to put in her dad as one of the main Cobras. But I wanted this to be a bit more original and hey there were loads of Cobra Kai in Kreeses dojo we knew nothing about. So I wanted to add some character to the universe. Not just use old names. Please review.[Chapter 3] Jess woke up with a groan. She had been on a late night bender of cheap booze she had bought off some seniors. She had a mini meltdown after the teachers had to drag her off the stage after challenging Lawrence. She was mad at herself. She had let her anger take control and she had made a fool of herself in front of everyone. She knew now that Sam would probably think she's some psycho and wouldn't want anything to do with her. She sighs and sits up when there's a knock on her bedroom. She guesses it's her mum and is surprised to see Sam standing there. Sam looks at her. \"You look like shit.\" \"Good morning to you too.\" Jess grumbles. Sam walks in and sits next to her. \"You okay? I couldn't find you after school.\" Jess shrugs. \"I'm surprised you even wanted to.\" \"Hey its okay I get it. You have every right to be pissed at him. You're still my friend. Look I'm not pefect I've done some stupid shit but we cant beat ourselves up forever. Look I made this offer before but come train with me and my dad. Also you can say no if you want but at the end of the month me and dad are heading to Okinawa. Dads opening a tournament in honour of his sensei mr Miyagi. I'm thinking of competing. I spoke to dad and said you could come if you want.\" Jess looked at her stunned she had not expected the conversation to go this way. \"Wow I mean thanks that's awesome I'd love to but there's no way I can afford that.\" Sam shakes her head. \"Don't worry dad said he'd cover all costs for you.\" Jess frowns. \"I'm not a charity case you know. Why would he do that he's never met me?\" \"No but he has a good understanding of hating Cobra Kai.\" A few weeks later Jess was sat in the back of a taxi looking out at the Okinawan scenery. She had begun training with Sam and Daniel the same day and had thoroughly enjoyed the training. It had been less physical than what she was used to but it was more peaceful and calmed her down a lot which is something she needed. Most of the training was spent on kata and while Jess had never done this before and wasn't exactly a natural she enjoyed the challenge of learning it. One thing she had seen was just how good Sam was. She'd seen it in their first sparring match but watching her do her katas was a beautiful sight. She flowed instinctively from one movement to the next. It inspired her to keep practicing her kata. She had also gotten close to Mr. Larusso. She had been him in those lame car commercials but in person he was a nice sensitive guy who believed in more of the internal side of martial arts than the external and physical side. \"Hey Jess you okay?\" Daniel looked over at her noticing she was lost in thought. Sam was asleep on the opposite seat of the taxi. \"Yeah I'm fine just…it's weird I've never left America before and this place is well….huge.\" Daniel laughed. \"Tell me about it I must've been your age when I first came here. Trust me it is difficult but one of the things Karate teaches us is to adapt to our surroundings right?\" Jess nods. \"Yeah I guess so.\" The first 2 days were spent sight seeing and looking around the city. They were staying in some old village where apparently mr. Miyagi had lived. Jess liked it. It was quiet and relaxing ther. Every morning the 3 would train in the houses dojo. Which Jess noticed was almost identical to the one at Daniels house. One evening after training Sam and Jess went back to their room they were sharing. Jess started to change out of her gi into her pyjamas but she noticed Sam was changing into regular non karate training clothes. \"Hey what're you doing?\" Jess asked confused. \"I thought id get in a small run before bed the tournaments in a few days. I should get my cardio up.\" \"I thought you said you weren't taking this seriously and was just a bit of fun?\" \"I am but my dads opening the tournament and we're representing an Okinawan style of karate even If I lose I want to look good.\" \"Yeah okay fair enough.\" \"Come with me if you like?\" Jess thought about it. She was tired but this place didn't have wi-fi or even a tv so there was nothing else to do without Sam there. \"Fine just let me change first.\" Jess let Sam lead where they went. Sam seemed to know where they were going so Jess just followed. They ran at a decent pace. Not enough to exhaust but enough to get a sweat on. They ran round the village a few times and Sam waved at passers by. They run a few miles into town before Sam takes them down to a beach and calls out to her. \"Hey see those ruins up there?\" Jess looks and nods. \"Yeah?\" \"Race ya\" Same grins and sprints off. \"Oi\" Jess laughs and sprints after her. They both get there around the same time both out of breath but laughing. Jess shoves her playfully. \"You're such a cheat I'd have won if we had an even start.\" \"Yeah yeah keep dreaming girl. Look that\" She points to the ruins which looked like a stadium with a platform In the middle. \"Every year the village has a traditional dance there as some celebration. The tournaments also gonna be ther.\" Jess looked at her surprised. \"I thought it was going to be in some sports arena?\" Sam laughs. \"Have you actually seen anywhere like that around here.\" \"Okay fair enough.\" \"You know my dad fought here once when he was about our age.\" \"What he competed here as well?\" \"Nah not in a tournament. In a fight to the death.\" Jess looks at her. \"Are you fucking with me here?\" Sam laughs. \"No I'm serious. When dad came here apparently he pissed off some top fighter here and took his honour or something so that guy swung in during the dance and put a knife to the girl he was datings neck and said he had to fight or he'd kill her.\" \"And your dad won?\" \"He's still here isn't he?\" \"Damm that's intense. Sounds like a bad Kung Fu movie.\" Both her and Sam laugh before Sam checks her watch. \"We better get back before dad makes us fight for our lives.\" She laughs again. \"Fine but slower this time.\" They run off. The day of the tournament arrives and Jess and Sam were sitting at the side of the platform of the ruins they'd visited. Jess was impressed at the setting. No matter what happened this was going to be a cool place to compete. There would only be one fight at a time in front of the whole crowd. Jess wasn't exactly thrilled about that but she reasoned that even if she embarrassed herself she'd ever see any of these people apart again apart from Sam and Mr. Larusso. She looks around at all the different dojos from Okinawa. Her and Sam were the only 2 western competitors and it made Jess feel a bit uneasy but Sam seemed perfectly calm and relaxed. Jess couldn't believe how well balanced Sam was. Her attention was bought back to the present when she noticed Mr. Larusso walk onto the platform and handed a microphone to make a speech. The crowd immediately went silent. \"Thank you everyone. It's an honour to be here. This tournament means a lot to me to honour my sensei. Though Mr. Miyagi didn't believe in these types of events. He did believe in unity and friendship. That is what this tournament is about. All dojos and all styles here to meet each other and test their abilities. There are no grudges to be settled no enemy's just friendly competition in the true warrior spirit that Karate is known for. Good luck everyone. The crowd cheered and clapped as Daniel sat down and whispered to the girls. \"Well that was a lot less painful than when I was last on that platform.\" The tournament begins and Jess is engrossed in the action watching all the different methods of fighting and enjoyed talking to Sam and Daniel about what they were watching. Eventually it gets to Jess's division to fight. She and Sam were different belt ranks so would not be competing in the same division. So they had no chance of facing each other which both were happy about. Jess stand up and fist bumps Sam and Daniel whispers to her. \"Use your focus think of the mindset you do your kata no single shots just one move straight after the other. Block everything out apart from your opponent. The crowd doesn't exist. Just enjoy the moment.\" Jess nods and slowly walks across the bridge onto the platform. Her opponent a tall Japanese girl doesn't bother with the bridge and jumps over. Her face brimming with confidence. Jess ties her brown belt tight onto her white gi with the Miyagi do patch on the back which she had been given just before leaving America. The 2 bow to each other and the referee who gives them the instruction to fight. Her opponent drops into an extremely deep stance. Jess had seen this stance before but was not a fan of it. In her mind while the stance can generate a lot of power it's almost impossible to move well. Jess starts moving in and out using her speed. The girl fires a hard roundhouse kick to Jess's head which would've knocked her out if she hadn't dodged. Jess noticed quick there were no combinations from her opponent just single strikes. Jess moved in faked a jab to the head and through a front kick and quickly twisted it mid kick into a roundhouse kick which landed square on her opponents chin. Jess grins as she steps back to her line. \"Point round kick 1-0.\" The referee declared and started the fight again. This time her opponent was more aggressive and went for her hard and landed a front kick to her body. Jess immediately felt the power and went down hard. \"Point front kick 1-1.\" The referee said as Jess stumbled back up to her line. When the fight starts again jess attacks immediately with a spinning kick which lands into her body scoring the next point. She lands her final point by landing a reverse punch. She bows and walks off the stage and high fives Sam. The rest of the tournament passes with no issue. Jess makes it to the finals easily and defeats her opponent 3-0 getting the trophy for the brown belt division. Sam also dominates her division and wins the black belt division. The next day the Miyagi do dojo leaves on the first plane out and Jess feels a lot happier and a lot more relaxed than she had in years. But how long will this last? A/N: Please review on what you think. I didn't focus much on this tournament because its more of a side story there'll be a full tournament in later chapters. Thank you for reading.

CHAPTER- 1 He saw some people rush to the airport terminal gate as the announcement for the some outbound flight droned monotonously over the p.a. system in mechanical sweet voice of a lady. A few persons were dragging trains of luggage behind them, exhausted from a long journey, yet smiling at having finally reached back home. But he was among those who were embarking on a journey. He was sitting at the waiting area awaiting announcement of his flight. He touched his own blue trolley bag instinctively and let out a deep sigh. 'Yes, he was also going home', or so his mother said. But for him, what he was leaving behind was home...His home. The home he grew up in. Earlier that day, he had woken up suddenly and looked at the almost empty room around the bed. Realisation had dawned a moment later. Later that day, they were going to board the plane that would take them from their home town Detroit to Beijing, China. He had already said goodbye to his school friends the day before. After that formal goodbye, he had spent the evening with his four besties. No wonder he came home last night crying bitterly. He thought with a pang of sadness how much would he miss them. He had cleared the bed this morning, stuffing the sheets in the box as they would be donated along with other items which they could not take with them. His uncle and aunt would see through the donation process, they had relieved his mother of that tedious job. How supporting they were! Though he was not overly attached to his uncle Charles and aunty Martha, his mom's sister, he knew they were very kind and helpful to his mom. He was surprised that he would miss even them. Who would help them in the foreign land? No one. They would be there.. alone. He had showered, got dressed in clothes that had been lying beautifully ironed and folded on the otherwise empty table in his room. His mother had been rushing about the house making sure everything was done properly before their journey. He knew his mother was determined to make it a memorable goodbye to the wonderful stage where numerous happy-sad moments of their life had played out. His mother had been tired but happy on making the final preparations for the move. He had contributed by running errands for her. But however hard he had tried, he could not share in her enthusiasm and effort. He stared back at the small, thin, chocolate-skinned boy looking back at him in the mirror. White shirt, brown corduroy pants, and metallic sneakers.. he looked a typical American boy. He rubbed his hands along his beautiful dreadlocks, smiling lazily at the reflection. Then he donned on his favourite St. LA Dodgers baseball cap in bright orange carefully. It was then while he was observing himself in the mirror that his eye caught the side panel of the door behind him. He turned around and looked reminiscently at the graffitied vertical side panel. He grew nostalgic looking at the markings in the clumsy, round handwriting of a child. He rushed to the box carrying items-to-be-donated and pulled out a marker from within it. He then decisively marched to the panel and studied it. He couldn't help reading the graffiti again, even though he knew by heart what was written. For he himself had written it. He started reading from bottom to top. It read- 09/01/01 START KINDERGARTEN .. ... 01/01/02 (unreadable..) 12/01/02 LOST FIRST TOOTH 11/24/03 FIRST HOME RUN .. ... .. . As he read the inscription upwards, he instinctively touched it and numerous memories related to those inscriptions flooded him... KINDERGARTEN. He faintly remembered crying on the very first day of his educational journey, having seen unknown faces around him at school.. He had written two more dates : 01/01/02, 10/04/02 above the first entry but couldn't remember why those dates were important. Probably he was too young and small to be able to describe it on the panel, so had left it as such; or maybe he couldn't fit it in that little space so in childish innocence had decided to abandon the pursuit. Anyway, he suddenly desired that he should have written something describing those dates. He was sure they were good memories that were eluding him. He felt angry at himself for not maintaining a detailed record. ..or were they bad memories? He didn't remember. He moved on to the next entry. Important moment in his life. His first tooth had broken. He did agree that it was a bit silly to think of first tooth loss as important. Yet...duh! You can't put logic on feelings. He couldn't help feeling like that, grown-up boys being strong be damned! He remembered how he used to play with the wobbling premolar in his mouth with his tongue for days. And when the tooth had finally broken, he had felt something unique had happened. Then later on his tongue kept trying to play with the wobbling tooth which by then had become an empty gum socket. He used to feel quite wierd.. but he didn't remember when he had forgotten about it. Maybe, he should have mentioned that date on the panel too. He regretted that he could not recall significant events of his life at the moment, when it had become so essential for him to do so. He so desperately wanted to cling on to his memories as he was reluctantly going to start a new chapter of his life in a foreign land. He moved on in the list. Other major milestones in his life. First home run in baseball court(\"He had felt on the top of the world\").. more gaps... less dates.. only major dates.. 9th birthday. Yes, he did remember that. Best birthday of his life. His three best friends- Kim, Allan and Chuck had planned a surprise birthday party, complete with mom and close relatives and... dad. He quickly moved on to the next entry, fearful of memory of that person. He did not know what his feelings were on that subject. He used to try his level best not to think of that very important piece of his life, fearing that it will bring pain and God-knows-what that he would not be able to handle. However, the next and final entry made it impossible for him not to think about it. 11/13/07 DADDY DIED. Ok, How was it? Many leave this fanfiction just after reading thw first chapter. Believe me , you should persevere a bit and read subsequent chapters. you won't be disappointed. This is my very first, ever fanfiction attempt and I'm a bundle of nerves. It would be appreciated if some reviews come my way to let me know -'how was it!\":)) Thanks for reading. See ya with the next chapter.[Chapter 2] Hello again.. enjoy the next chapter! CHAPTER-2 Daddy. His lovely daddy. As far as he could remember, his daddy was his best friend. Yes, his best friends were Allan, Chuck, and Kim, but still daddy was his BESTEST friend in the world. His daddy and he used to go to late night strolls on the street outside thier house. He would clutch daddy's little finger and, bursting with childlike enthusiasm, narrate his daily batch of happenings- what happened at school, at home and his corresponding feelings. Daddy would patiently listen to all his stories, displaying a wide array of emotions just for his sake- sometimes eyes wide in surprise, sometimes excited with suspense. However, at most other times, a genial, indulgent friendly smile played upon his lips that nearly made him burst with happiness everytime he saw daddy's face. He liked his daddy. Daddy and he were crazy about baseball. They would often plonk on the sofa in front of the TV on lazy afternoons and binge watch matches, high-fiving like over-excited boys! It was not very long ago. He remembered all these memories with a pang of sadness and knew only one thing- he missed his daddy. Although now, the pain had dulled a little. Earlier his eyes would water, merely on hearing his friends talk excitedly about their outings with their mom and dad and siblings. His little family was now only his mom and his little cozy Detroit home.. Oh! Very soon even his home was going to be a part of distant memory! He sighed, pulling himself out of the painful memories, and made the final entry- \"MOVED TO CHINA\"! He was jolted into reality as he felt his mom shaking him by the arm. She asked, with lines of consternation apparent on her forehead,\"Dre! Our flight announcement has been made. We need to board!\" It was then that he realised she had been shaking him for the past five minutes, worrying over his non-reaction. Next moment, he had to get up immediately because his mom practically screamed, \"DRE! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? GET UP!\" Dre started collecting his luggage. As he reached the line in front of the luggage check-in counter, he finally realised; everything that was his life was breaking up slowly. First his dad, now their house in Detroit and family and friends. He was leaving all behind. Luggage cleared and dispatched off, Dre and his mom followed other co-passengers to the boarding gate. With suspense on what awaited them in China, and a very heavy heart at leaving everything behind, he plodded after his mother through the jet bridge, the noises of the terminal fading with every step. Dre's mother had been keenly observing her only son ever since she had broken the news a month ago that they would move to Beijing. She had despaired as her boy went from confusion, shock and anger to reluctant acceptance, to finally dejection and utter sadness. Seeing him go through such a negative roller coaster emotional ride, she would feel pangs of panic and guilt. She felt as if everything was going wrong. But she never felt more right in her life about any other decision either. Her life, like most mothers on this planet, was centred around her child Dre. After her husband's death, she realised that now she had an tricky responsibility to ensure that Dre never suffered without his dad being there to groom him. She knew her husband connected better with Dre; they were like close friends rather than a usual father-son duo. She knew her son loved her too, but the connection was not as strong as with his father. Hence, she was not particularly surprised when Dre became very quiet and reserved after his dad's death. She ignored her own grief at the time, and tried giving more attention and quality time to him. But even after more than a year of Dre's dad's death, he had not recovered to his original cheerful and excited nature. He even ignored his favourite sport, baseball and lagged behind in studies. A smile on his face had become a rarity. Her son was now a sullen and depressed young boy. But she believed that every problem had a solution. She encouraged him to spend more time with his best friends. She went to festivals, parks and baseball matches with him, even though she herself had very sober tastes in life. She often burst into childlike enthusiasm in an unfortunately, futile attempt to transfer some of the infectious emotion to her son. In one-and-a-half years after her husband's death, she had exhausted herself and was then seriously concerned. She finally confided her worries to her closest people; her sister and elder brother-in-law supported, guided and counselled her. It was then that she had taken the life-altering decision of moving to China. Her decision had surprised some and shocked many people. She had been toying with the idea of moving houses after her husband's death. Dre had been totally against it at that time and she had dropped it. But recently she had been offered a promotion and a handsome pay raise for a respected position in Beijing. The idea had taken root. It was a challenging position at work so when it was offered to her, she saw her financial position become better in the coming years; that would secure Dre's future. She considered rejecting it for it would be too tumultuous a change in their steady lives, thinking of choosing a less lucrative but domestic position in Manhattan instead. After weeks of pondering over it, she talked to her friends about her predicament. And the result of all those endless discussions with her sister and brother-in-law that Dre was getting suspicious about was- they were moving to China. She accepted the position three weeks ago and rest had been a haze of exhausting preparations. Today morning she had not been able to control the tears that spilled off while removing the last photo frames that captured their many special moments in the home. She would miss everything about the place. The kitchens shelves that she used to scrub every weekend, or the almirahs that housed her husband's clothes, or the bed on which her little boy Dre overslept everyday. She would not bid a tearful goodbye but a cheerful farewell to the beautiful times spent in the house. Their bye was full of love, thanking the house for being their abode yet apologizing sincerely for parting ways, just like they did to their other friends and family members. She thought with some anxiety yet anticipation as they took their seats on the plane, CHINA, HERE WE COME![Chapter 3] CHAPTER- 3 Dre hoisted his small carry- bag and shoved it into the luggage rack overhead as his mother's voice announced to him, \"Chapter 10, finally! Dre let's start.\" Dre closed his eyes and breathed out slowly, mentally pleading for patience from God. Boy, his mother was so stubborn. He plonked back on his seat as his mother intoned in Chinese, reading from the laptop screen. \"Ni jiao shen he ming zi\" \"It means: what's your name?\" \"My name is Dre Parker and you know it\", Dre replied with a smirk. His mother screwed her eyes at him sternly. He enjoyed riling up his mother when she made him do something that he didn't want to do. Dre's mother patiently said- \"Dre, you need to practice. Everyone speaks Chinese in China. You will be lost there without it.\" \"Mom, why is it necessary to go to China? Next I realise, we'll be going to Japan. I'm not going to learn a hundred languages, just because you decided that we roam all over the world!\" \"Dre, our home is going to be China and that's- \" Dre interrupted, his impatience rising- \"Mom, China is full of old houses, old parks, old people.\" Snatching a magazine from the rack in front of him, he showed his mother the cover. \"Mom, look at this man, he's about hundred years old.\" He flipped through the pages, showing her a decrepit, old Chinese building- \"We'll have to live here!? Of all places to move to, you chose China?\", he hissed angrily at last. His mother had shock and anger written across her face. Dre had never been so outspoken and angry about what troubled him. He usually grumbled and whined like little boys, often crying to melt her heart in favour of his wishes. Today's outburst, though hissed rather than yelled because of their public setting, showed how much Dre was against moving to China. Her heart sank, with it her face too. But a moment later, she steeled herself, pulling herself to her full hieght, turned to Dre on her seat and replied calmly, albiet in a quiet, dangerous tone, \"Dre, this is the last time you use this tone with me. Your reasons are illogical. Don't build preconceived notions about a country you don't know anything about. You'll see what I mean when you land in China. I have given a lot of thought to it, unlike you, shoving magazines down my throat.\" Then in a kind, understanding voice, she continued, \"Dre, you are a courageous boy. Nobody is going to eat you up there. Shall we now proceed with our lesson 10?\" Dre's anger disappeared as fast as it had appeared. Though still seething, he became silent and now was a little wary of his mother. He submissively obeyed his mother without a comment and waited for her to start. Sitting deflated on his seat, he heard his mum order through clenched teeth, \"Dre, the man next to you\", she nodded her head towards man sitting across the aisle, \"Ask him in Chinese- 'Hello, what's your name?'\" No choice at all. He had to do it. He turned, gave the man a look but hesitated. The man stared back impatiently. Words tumbled out of Dre's mouth lest the man turn away- \"Ni jiao... shen .. he ming zi?\" The man gave him a cool look. Confused and hesitant, Dre merely waited for a response. \"Dude, I'm from Detroit.\" \"Oh!\" It was awkward and funny at the same time. The man was smirking at him and waiting for him to say something else. To get away from the awkwardness that arose in the fine air between them on the aisle, he immediately blurt out,- \"whatsup!\" There! The stock, American greeting! The man shrugged and turned away. Dre was oddly relieved. If this Chinese-looking man didn't know Chinese, then Ha! he was better off. At least he knew how to say, \"what's your name?\" in Chinese. And his mum wanted him to practice with other people! With a relieved grin he leaned back on the seat and closed his eyes. Dre was annoyed. His first day in the foreign land was tumultuous. No, maddening. No, wierd. Dre had gaped at one of the most opulent and state-of-the-art airports in the world as they had landed in the Chinese capital of Beijing. After that, wherever he turned, he saw mostly Chinese-looking people (of course, he rolled his eyes at himself!). It was wierd to see mostly black hair or people with very different features. He was used to seeing people with baseball caps or wearing bermuda shorts in America. Here, he saw men and young boys alike in full pants or maybe three-fourths, at most. Women were stylish yet had an indescribable air of focus and sincere ambition. Instead of looking hippie-cool or glamorous like a typical American, women looked elegant and disciplined. They were not merely walking on the streets, they had the quick, focused gait of wanting to reach their destination on time. He was bewildered even more because he heard people around him speaking in a very different-sounding language, evidently Chinese. He could hardly understand more than a few words. It sounded more like babbling to him. He resigned himself to the fate of being clueless in a foreign land. He wished he had concentrated more on Chinese lessons with his mother. His mother looked quite enthusiastic, her eyes filled with wonder. Her face looked like that of a little girl when she steps into Disneyland. If his mother was so excited, then he definitely wouldn't like the place, Dre concluded. She had adopted this attitude lately. Whenever Dre's mother wanted him to like something, she would start behaving like an over-excited, silly girl, as if he was a little kid requiring to be coddled. Dre didn't like it one bit. Why didn't she realise that was a grown-up boy? After all, he was a 13-year old man, not a boy anymore! As they sat in the car of the landlady, who had come to receive them at the airport with the sign- 'MRS PACKER' instead of 'MRS PARKER', Dre couldn't help but begrudgingly acknowledge his mum's victory on one thing. Because forget old, this city was futuristic like straight out of some Star Wars movie! Tall skyscrapers with amazing, unique designs and wide, express lanes with shining, sleek luxury cars rolling by. In his opinion, Beijing was 'cooler' than New York or Las Vegas! This was amazing for him. He counted at least 10 Audies zoom past their car during their journey to the new home. He could only gawk at with eyes wide open and jaw hanging as they whizzed past. Only one word tumbled out of his mouth ... COOL! As a dazed Dre Parker got of the car, his mother intoned staring at the building, \" Dre! See, our building's name is Beverly Hills!\" Then, smiling indulgently at him, she asked, \"You always talked about living in the Beverly Hills, no?\" Dre had to roll his eyes at her sickeningly, sweet jesting tone. He deadpanned, \"Mom, it was the LA Beverly Hills we talked about.\" His mother smirked challengingly at him; she walked away saying, \"I got a good feeling about this.\" The driver, meanwhile, pulled out the luggage and piled it on the front steps of the building. To the surprise of Dre, a young, lean, blond boy came up to them, shook hands with Dre and introduced himself. \"You must be the new guys shifting in 305. I'm Harry. Lemme' help you out.\" \"Hey, whattsup!\" Dre was relieved. Thank God! At least, he found an American here. He even talked like one of them. He was sure the boy would help him. Smiling gratefully, he hauled his luggage and started following Harry. Harry chatted with him and informed him to come downstairs to the park once they settled down. As they brought the luggage to the new apartment, Mum spotted Harry and Dre instantly knew what was coming. He groaned. Mum piped in a friendly, motherly voice- \"Look at you, making friends already!\", and beaming at them. Then shaking hands with Harry, she spoke-\"I'm Dre's mother. You can call me Miss Sherry. Hi Harry\", last part as Harry politely introduced himself. Then smirking, she marched off into the apartment after the landlady, who was pompously going full 'guide-mode' about their apartment. His mother was a typical \"friendly mother\". She conversed freely with all his friends and so indulgently, that most of his friends often came to their house just so that they could demand \"miss Sherry's\" tasty snacks that she made for them. Dre often felt that Dre's friends were more friendly with his mother than himself. He entered the apartment. It seemed nice, cozy and spacious enough. No carpet flooring, wood flooring instead. Good. He could skateboard here. He was already liking the whole place. So far so good. Yet he was a bit nervous. As Mum went on to check the amenities, he decided to check out the park instead.

Hace poco que vi \"Hansel y Gretel: Cazadores de Brujas\" y DIOOOOOOSSSS, ¡me ha encantadoooo, en serio! Sobretodo Gretel *0* Oh, Dios, Gretel. ¡Es tan malditamente genial! Creo seriamente que me he enamorado de ella 3 En fin, no pude evitar escribir esto, espero que os guste. Tengo el headcanon de que Hansel y Gretel fueron \"abandonados\" con 10 años (porque todos los niños tienen 10 años en las historias xP) y en este One Shoot tienen 13-14 años. Pd: I love you Gretel, marry me! *0* — ¡YO...! ¿YA NO TE PROTEGERÉ MÁS? — En su situación, prender un fuego era peligroso. Gretel lo sabía y su hermano también. Pero no les quedaba de otra, si no querían morir congelados. La joven maldijo por lo bajo. En el último pueblo en el que habían estado, habían sido unos tacaños, unos puñeteros agarrados. Pero cuando eres solo \"una estúpida chica y su hermano\", ese tipo de desprecios son de esperarse, aunque hayas arriesgado tu vida matando a una bruja para salvar sus ingratas vidas. ¿Injusto? Sí. ¿Iba a quejarse? No. Porque la cantidad que les habían dado por su trabajo era lo justo y necesario para la medicina de Hansel. Y no era por mal, pero prefería pasar todas las noches del resto de su vida a la intemperie por no pagar para estar en una posada, a encontrarse a su hermano muerto por culpa de sus altos niveles de azúcar. Él era lo único de valor de tenía (sin contar sus escopetas especiales antifaz brujas) y como que pasando de perderle, gracias. — El fuego está listo —la voz de su mellizo la sacó de sus pensamientos. Daba pena ver la humilde llamita que Hansel había podido crear con algunos cuantos palos y la hoja de periódico del día que ellos protagonizaban, pero a pesar de su fama no podían aspirar a más. Además, no podían saber si alguna bruja vengativa les rondaba o no, y obvio que hablando en esos términos, esa pequeña llama era más segura que una hoguera bien hecha. Gretel leyó, así como de distraídamente, de nuevo el titular, antes de que la llama lo consumiera, tal cual le había sucedido a su primera víctima, en el horno de aquella casita de chocolate y mazapán. Solo que sin agónicos gritos, suplicando por una clemencia que ninguno de los dos hermanos iba a sentir ni en un millón de años. Mientras, Hansel se arrebujaba en su propio saco de dormir, inconsciente de los recuerdos que asolaban a su hermana mayor y que eran los mismos que él tenía. HANSEL Y GRETEL MATAN A LA BRUJA DEL PRADO De esa frase ya solo quedaban cenizas y algo de humo. Al menos en estado físico. — Toma —la chica metió la mano en su saco de provisiones y Hansel fue lo suficientemente rápido para interceptar entre sus manos la pera que su hermana le lanzó. No era precisamente una buena cena para dos chicos en desarrollo, pero lo preferían mil veces a alguna chuche, en especial Hansel, que aunque pudiera seguir tomando dulce, no lo haría más en lo que le quedaba de vida. — Tenemos un encargo —el chico rompió el silencio en cuanto Gretel se sentó a su lado, con su propio saco. Ella le miró entre medio sorprendida y medio enfadada. — Se suponía que tenías que quedarte en el punto de encuentro, mientras yo cazaba. El chico se encogió un poco ante la voz dura de su hermana mayor. — ¡Y eso hice...! Resulta que pasó gente recolectando fruta, mucha fruta, por aquí y me enteré de que una bruja les estaba robando las provisiones de carne... Gretel gimió. — Con razón no encontré ni un puñetero animal por aquí —se quejó al aire. — De todas formas, solo tuve que decirles quien era yo para que me suplicaran ayuda. ¡Hasta vino aquí el Alcalde! — Uyyyy —se quejó Gretel. — Raro, lo sé, ¿por qué crees que te dije que nos cambiáramos de lugar en cuánto llegaste? Es obvio que ese alcalde estaba controlado por la bruja. — Cantado —convino Gretel—. Esta noche tendremos que dormir con un ojo abierto. — Me toca a mi la primera guardia. Gretel tuvo que ahogar su molestia ante eso. De todas formas, no le quedaba de otra que pasarle una de sus escopetas de última generación a su hermano menor, poco después de apagar el fuego. Hansel se quedó mirando fijamente el arma entre sus manos en completo silencio, en medio de la oscuridad durante unos segundos, para después levantarse para hacer guardia. Daba gusto verle, el arma parecía una extensión de su brazo y eso que ni tan siquiera estaba en pose de defensa. Y entonces fue que Gretel sintió de nuevo un pinchazo en el orgullo... o al menos quería creer que era su orgullo. Porque era el único sentimiento que se permitía tener. Se había acostumbrado a ser, de los dos, ella la cazadora de brujas, la que siempre mostraba la cara contra la bestia de turno y Hansel el escudero que se quedaba siempre a una distancia prudencial, hasta que ayudaba a su hermana a dar el golpe final. Tendría que suceder tarde o temprano, se dijo la joven, él algún día tendría que salir del caparazón y aprender de las habilidades innatas de su melliza. Su hermano estaba creciendo, Gretel se dio cuenta de eso muy a su pesar. — Lo has hecho bien hoy —dijo la joven cazadora. Y, si su hermano la escuchó, no lo demostró. Puede que estuviera molesto con ella, o tal vez no. A final de cuentas no era la primera batalla en la que ambos resultaron ser momentáneamente separados, solo que cuando Gretel logró regresar al punto de partida, su corazón henchido de preocupación por su mellizo que no era capaz de luchar solo, se llevó la sorpresa de su vida al notar el cadáver de la bruja, olvidado de cualquier forma en el pasto. Hansel se encontraba posicionado a su lado, totalmente guarro, lleno de sangre ajena, y, sin embargo, sonriente, le había dicho \"trabajo hecho\" como si fuera el pan de cada día. Y lo era. Pero siendo ella la que vencía al monstruo y salvaba a su hermanito, no al revés. La escena la había llenado de un estupor del que todavía no salía. — ¿Has dicho qué te suplicaron ayuda? —justo cuando Hansel pensaba que era el único despierto en el lugar, ella volvió a romper el silencio. En medio de la oscuridad de la noche, él asintió. — Parece que mañana nos pagaran bien. — ¿Por qué das por hecho que acabaremos el trabajo tan rápido? — Por favor —respondió él, con desden y egocentrismo, y ella no pudo hacer más que reírse de manera ahogada. — Podríamos pasar un par de noches en una posada, tal vez. No nos vendría mal tener un techo sobre nuestras cabezas durante un tiempo. — Podríamos tener una casa propia —Hansel dejo caer, aun ya sabiendo de sobra la negativa de su hermana. Ella tomó un pequeño guijarro cerca suyo y lo lanzó con todas sus fuerzas contra los arboles, un misero placebo para calmar la impotencia de no poder llevar una vida normal. Todo por culpa de sus padres. ¿Por qué los abandonarían? ¿Por qué tan cerca de la casa de turrón y azúcar de una bruja? ¿Qué hicieron mal? — Nadie quiere tener de vecinos a los dos chicos más buscados por las brujas, Hansel —respondió la cruda realidad—. Y de tener una casa propia, ¿cómo pagaríamos las rentas para mantenerla, si no es saliendo a la pista de monstruos a los que patear el culo? Al final sería como no tenerla —eso de manejar dinero y ganarse la vida realmente era agotador—. Y ya me dirás como obtendríamos tu... Hansel tosió sonoramente, dándole a entender que se callara. Habían sido ya cuatro años desde que el medico le diagnosticó la enfermedad del azúcar, por culpa de esa bruja que quiso cebarlo. De por vida. Pero él aun no lo aceptaba, menos siendo totalmente consciente de que si ahora pasaban la noche al aire libre, era por culpa del coste de la medicina que necesitaba para vivir. Tamborileó con los dedos el arma entre sus manos. — Yo... lo siento —se atrevió a decir—. Si no me hubiera comido todos esos dulces... — La zorra de esa bruja me habría matado, Hansel —le cortó ella, negándose a que su hermano se sintiera culpable—. Eso habría pasado. — Y si tú no te hubieras atrevido a esgrimir ese cuchillo, a mi me habría comido... —susurró él entre dientes para si mismo, auto regañandose su cobardía de antaño, pero aún así Gretel le escuchó. No dijo nada al respecto, sin embargo, callándose su opinión del cambio en batalla de su hermano menor. Cuando su mellizo estaba en plan cabezota, no había nada que hacer, salvo dormir. Notó como él se sentaba de nuevo a su lado. No, un momento, no se sentó, más bien se había dejado caer, y el arma también, mientras soltó un quejido y se agarraba el vientre con las manos. — ¿Hansel? Él no contestó. Preocupada, tomó su rostro entre las manos y examinó sus ojos a la luz de la luna en cuarto menguante, que hacían ver el rostro del joven más pálido de lo normal. No, ninguna bruja lo estaba controlando. Eso tenía que ser... — ¡Mierda Hansel! ¿Cuándo fue la última vez que te pusiste la inyección? El silencio del joven, acompañado de un quejido mayor, fue respuesta suficiente. — Mierda, mierda, mierda —nerviosa, a pesar de todo, Gretel fue capaz de encontrar la gruesa aguja de hierro, zapateada entre el saco de su hermano. Sin ninguna ceremonia, la clavó en el pálido brazo de esté, tal y como si estuviera matando a una presa, y solo respiró tranquila cuando notó que el color volvía a la piel de Hansel. De un empujón, él logró quitársela de encima, pero eso no le libró de una sonora bofetada. — ¡Idiota! —bramó la mayor— ¿Qué parte de \"si no te pones la inyección, mueres\" no entiendes? — Quería comprobar si era cierto... —el joven miro avergonzado al suelo, no pensaba que fuera a doler tanto, esperaba con el latido del corazón en sus oídos, más reclamos por parte de ella. Unos que nunca llegaron. Gretel estaba demasiado sorprendida con su hermano antes, como para regañarle, para ahora sumarle este intento de suicidio. Porque era lo que era. — No se te ocurra volver a hacerlo —al final todo quedó simplemente en esa frase. Hansel asintió para seguidamente volver a su puesto, mientras Gretel volvía a taparse dentro de su saco. — Gracias —dijo el joven segundos después—, si no fuera por ti, seguro que habría muerto hace mucho. Él no tenía idea de cuán feliz (y segura) que la hacía sentirse esa frase. Porque se dio cuenta de que aunque su hermano creciese, ella lo hacía con él y con 12 minutos de ventaja. \"Por nada\" —pensó ella. — No importa cuan mayor te hagas, Hansel, yo siempre voy a estar ahí para salvarte el culo —susurró casi inaudiblemente. Él arqueó una ceja, perdido. — Perdona, ¿dijiste algo? Demasiado tarde para preguntar. Gretel ya se estaba haciendo la dormida, con una sonrisa tatuada en su cara. ","Summary":" ¡Hola!

Characters are not mine, please enjoy! Comments are awesome. Someone has made a very serious mistake. Hansel stands in front of the remnants of their campsite on the edge of the forest. Their tents are shredded, their supplies scattered everywhere, smashed and destroyed, their cart is up in flames, their meager funds stolen. But Hansel doesn't care about any of that because there is something much more important missing from their temporary base: Ben. Gretel's standing over the ruins of the tent that he shared with Ben, and reluctantly he joins her when she calls him over. There are signs of a struggle beneath the destructive chaos, scuffs in the dirt around the entrance, and there's blood on the blankets – Ben's blood, he's sure – whoever had taken him had practically dragged him out of bed, but he hadn't gone quietly. That's when it starts. When he'd been learning how to use his magic, the mere thought of Ben in trouble was enough to make it go haywire. Here, now, with Ben actually in trouble, it feels nearly uncontrollable. He looks down and sure enough, his fingers are sparking with power, the electric blue lines spiraling over his palms and crawling slowly up his wrists, spider-webbing around his arms like intricate glowing tattoos. \"You need to calm down,\" Gretel warns him. \"I can't, you know I can't.\" He breathes out, because however Ben ended up tied so inextricably to his magic, it doesn't seem to be reacting well to his absence. \"Why would anyone take him except because of me?\" He wonders aloud, trying to focus on just breathing without Ben there as an anchor for his magic. \"Someone has to know about us. If they know, they'll-\" He can't bring himself to finish the thought, that they'll kill Ben for his relationship with Hansel. \"If anything happens to him…\" \"People have seen you use,\" Gretel reminds him. There'd been a big fight against a large coven of witches that had gained them a not immodest amount of popularity a few weeks back. She and her brother had both been casting, countering the spells the powerful witches had used, with Ben and Edward at their sides. \"It doesn't mean they know about the two of you, just that they think he might be able to tell them something about your magic. He was the only one here when they hit.\" But Ben would never talk, and so any questioning he might endure will likely be of the painful, torturous variety. Which is also, \"Not helping.\" \"Fine, then.\" She says, \"use your magic to our advantage. It's tied to Ben, so use it to help us find him.\" He concentrates, tries to channel his powers into the task, but it's so hard to control when Ben isn't around, even more so when he's in trouble. It just feels like it wants to explode everywhere, while he needs it precise and cooperative. \"Find him,\" he mumbles to himself, as Gretel wanders off to help Edward gather up the salvageable remains of their smoldering camp. \"Find him, find him, find him...\" His fingers spark with power, and suddenly everything is blue, and he's no longer standing in the middle of a scorched clearing, but in the middle of a stone-walled room, with screams echoing off the walls, and he's off and chasing the sound before he can even begin to fathom how this happened, how he got here (wherever here might be). Hansel calls out for Ben, voice a touch desperate as he listens for a response that isn't screaming. He's not worried about drawing attention to himself, since he has no qualms about grievously harming anyone who tries to stop him, anyone and everyone involved in trying to take Ben away from him. \"Ben!\" Ben's cries never seem to get any closer, despite the lengthy hallways he moves through. He turns a corner and suddenly they seem very close; down another corridor and the ricocheting screams come to an abrupt stop. \"Ben!\" His magic sparks to life again, and suddenly he's in another part of the expansive building. And so is Ben. He's slumped sideways in the chair he's been bound to, arms and legs securely fastened. Hansel races to him, quickly taking stock of the plethora of injuries that have been inflicted upon his Ben. His face is a mottled mess of black and blue and red. One eye is swollen shut entirely, the other nearly masked by a trail of blood spilling down from a deep gash on his forehead, with lips and nose equally bloodied. His hands aren't much better, with several nails missing (discarded on the floor at their feet), and some fingers just plain broken. Shallow cuts, still bleeding sluggishly, litter his arms and chest and thighs and Hansel can already feel his healing magic building up when he reaches out for Ben, moves to caress a rare unbruised bit of skin on his partner's face to try to wake him and get started fixing this mess. But something is wrong. He reaches out, but the touch never lands, his hand sort of phases through Ben and it's then, with a sudden rush of panic, that he realizes that he isn't really here. Just this piece of him that's so attached to Ben it came on its own to try to help. \"Ben,\" he whispers, fingers ghosting over Ben's lips. Slowly, Ben's eyes flutter open (as much as they can, anyway), and his brown eyes are bleary and unfocused as they search for him, but don't seem to find him, \"H-Hansel?\" \"I'm here,\" he says, even though it's not entirely true. \"I will be here. I promise.\" \" Please ,\" Ben begs, \"Hansel, it hurts s-so much. Please, help me.\" And oh, he wishes he could. His magic stirs, eager to be of use, but he doesn't think there's anything for it do right now. \"Soon,\" he swears, \"You stay strong, stay alive for me, Ben, yeah? And I'll be with you soon.\" \"Promise?\" Unable to stop himself from trying to offer comfort when his lover is so broken before him, he reaches out again, letting one hand – still sparking blue with potential magic- settle against Ben's chest, struggling to stay on the surface and not phase through again. \"Of course I promise,\" he assures Ben, \"There's nothing in the world that's going to stop me from getting you back.\" He needs to leave, he knows, needs to let himself go back to Gretel and Edward and get here for real. But first he needs to know where here is. It's heart-rending to walk away from Ben, but he forces himself to do it all the same. Hansel plans to find a window that might afford him a view of the surrounding landscape – they couldn't have gotten too far away with Ben in the time it took them to discover the ruins of their camp and he knows the area well enough, he thinks – but before he can make much progress toward that goal, his world flashes blue again and suddenly he's gasping for air, lying in the dirt and dead leaves in the forest, right where he'd been standing when he'd warped a part of himself away. Gretel, kneeling over him and looking quite panicked herself, sits back with a sigh of relief when he curls in on himself and fights to get his breathing under control. \"What the hell was that?\" She demands, anger now replacing her short-lived relief. \"Did you – do you need your meds?\" \"No,\" he assures her, because this isn't that, thankfully, \"How long was I gone?\" \"I don't know about gone, but you've been passed out on the ground for the last five minutes, at least.\" Not long, then, good. He's up and on his feet, which is maybe not the best decision he's ever made, since the world feels unsteady under him, like he's been on a boat for too long and is finally stepping back on land. She catches hold of him when he sways alarmingly, \"Whoa, care to tell me what's going on?\" \"I saw Ben.\" \"What?\" He struggles to find the words to explain this unexplainable thing, but manages to convey the basic idea well enough that she seems to believe him (but then none of his magic makes sense where Ben is concerned, never has and likely never will). She is considerably less understanding when he adds on, \"I got pulled back before I could figure out where they're keeping him.\" She and Edward both look frustrated with this lack of information, leaving them essentially back at square one. \"So now what? We just start checking all the big, stone buildings we can find?\" Hansel's head falls into his hands; he's exhausted and terrified and desperate. \"I don't know,\" he growls out, hates that he couldn't find a clue before he left Ben. \"Give me a minute.\" Gretel does as asked and leaves her brother to think this through, pulling Edward off with her so they can get back to their camp clean-up while Hansel decides how he wants to handle things. When he's sure he's alone, because he's positive Gretel wouldn't want him doing what he's about to do, he does the only thing he can think to do. \"Take me back,\" Hansel begs of his magic. \"Please, find him, find him, find Ben.\" He says, over and over and over again because it got him there before, along with all the same feelings of panic and desperation he's still feeling now. He closes his eyes and wills himself away. And when he opens them again, a long minute later, he's back. Only this time things don't seem quite so solid. If he'd had this the first time, he would've known it wasn't real, that he wasn't really here. But Ben still is. And he knows what he needs to do this time. He kneels before his lover, who's been further injured in the time since he was last here, by whatever unseen monsters dared to take him (more bruises, more cuts, more broken bones) and calls out to him again, trying to draw him back to consciousness. He gets no response. He wills his magic into something tangible, pouring everything – as much healing magic as he can along with the brightest light he can imagine - the sun, the moon, the stars – into one central point between his hands, forms a ball of it. It looks like some sort of jewel, rare and glowing with the same electric blue that his magic is. When he feels weak with the effort of creating it, when he feels the pull of his real body trying to drag him back, he pushes the orb into Ben's chest, into his heart – beating too fast and off rhythm – and leaves it behind for him. Then he's back on the forest floor. Ears ringing, vision whited out. Blood leaks from his nose and ears and eyes and it's all he can do just to roll to one side and vomit for what seems like an eternity, but he can feel it now. He can feel the link to the magic he gave away. He can find Ben. \"You idiot!\" Gretel shouts at him, again at his side while he tries to force the world to right itself around him. \"You did it again, didn't you? What good are you to Ben if you get yourself killed doing that?\" \"I know where he is now,\" he explains, gesturing in the general direction that the distant pull of his magic comes from. He struggles to his knees, fights through the wave of dizziness and nausea that overwhelms him and finally makes it to his feet, leaning hard against a nearby tree to keep steady. \"We have to go – I tried to heal him but I don't know if it worked and he's… it's not good. We need to get to him now.\" His sister wrangles him to her side, pulling an arm over her shoulder to support him as they hobble back toward where Edward waits with the gathered pieces of their camp. \"Let's get going, then.\" The three of them set off, Hansel directing them as they pick their way through a dense forest as the sun sets around them. No one suggests stopping, despite the dark sky, void of any helpful moonlight or starlight beneath the canopy of trees. He and Gretel could use their magic as sources of light, but they opt to continue carefully navigating in the darkness, hoping it will give them an edge in their rescue if no one knows they're coming. They'd already been well west of Augsburg, their informal base of operations, on the trail of a witch who'd been causing trouble near the edges of the Black Forest, and now it seems they're to journey ever further into its depths. \"You think we're close?\" Gretel asks, when they've been walking long enough that the first signs of dawn start to edge into the horizon. The feeling has gotten stronger as they've gotten closer, he can feel it practically pulling him in the right direction now – and does seem to be taking them well into the denser parts of the forest. \"Almost there,\" he decides. And, indeed, they are. Finally, there's a break in the tree-line, and what little moonlight there is outside of the forest barely illuminates the outline of a large, once-imposing structure set atop of an impressive hill, far above them. Whatever castle once stood here must have been quite the remarkable sight back in its day – it's been long abandoned, left in ruins, and nature has apparently tried it's hardest to reclaim the structure. The shield wall remains mostly intact, though crumbled in a few places and overrun with moss and vines. Two high towers stand in opposite corners, with one considerably less well-preserved than the other, and a large gate tower still stands largely undamaged, looming over the dilapidated remnants of a drawbridge that has long since rotted out and crashed to the ground in a dry moat. On approach, they find the strongly fortified heart of the castle itself still standing and relatively unscathed. Hansel recognizes the long, stone building as the one he'd been running around in during his initial search for Ben. \"He's here,\" he says, despite the overall abandoned feel of the place. They haven't seen signs that a single person has been inside these walls in more than a century and yet somehow he knows Ben is here. \"How do you want to do this?\" Gretel asks, the three of them gathered in the vacant outer ward. They both look to Edward, carrying their supplies, limited as they are after the raid on their camp. They didn't really come prepared for this, they came armed for fighting witches, after all – with enchanted crossbows and guns and blades all specifically designed to deal with the dark magic their enemies would possess. Those weapons won't hold nearly the same weight against whatever awaits them inside the castle ruins – they don't know who is behind this, how many men are waiting for them, what kind of weapons they possess or what their motives are in all of this. The low ceilings and small passages within the inner ward will be too small for Edward to easily navigate. He'd be better off outside, keeping the gate secure for their exit, they all agree, as Hansel and Gretel both load up on whatever weaponry they can. No one seems to be patrolling the grounds, which leads the siblings to believe that they hadn't expected to be found here – likely would never have been were it not for Hansel's magical link to Ben. That gives them an upper hand they'll need to win this fight – surprise. Gretel grabs up the last of the bolts for her crossbow, \"Ready?\" Hansel, armed with his favorite gun, the one with the bayonet, nods. The sooner they get this over with, the sooner he'll have Ben back where he belongs. \"Let's do this.\" Edward hoists them up and into a window on the second floor of the main building, which appears to be just as abandoned as the rest of the castle, and Hansel vaguely recognizes the halls as the ones he'd been in before. \"Downstairs, or in some sort of central room, I think,\" he explains quietly, recalling that there hadn't been any windows in the room he'd finally found Ben in. She nods and the two of them move carefully and cautiously through the same long hallways, checking rooms as they go and finding nothing. They reach a set of crumbling steps down to the main level of the building and search there, as well, with no results. Another staircase takes them even lower, into the depths of the castle and here there are finally signs of life. Fresh scuffs in the dust at their feet, fresh ash on the walls where torches illuminated the way – though none are presently lit here. The two siblings exchange a glance and they operate a bit more stealthily as they clear the rooms they pass now. Finally, they come upon a door that appears to have been recently replaced, fresh wood in place of the decayed wood that's marked every other one they've passed. Slowly, Gretel edges the door open. The room might have once been some sort of storeroom, but it's empty now, except for Ben. Only he's not alone this time. A handful of men stand around the chair they bound him to, talking amongst themselves in hushed whispers, oblivious to Hansel and Gretel who have entered behind them. His hands tighten on his gun. Gretel flanks out to his side, quiet as can be. They both take aim. Once in position, he fires off a shot into the stone ceiling. Everyone reacts, the half dozen men spin around wildly in search of the source of the noise, clearly panicked at having been found so unprepared. Some grab for their own weapons, but none are as advanced as the witch hunting arms they carry, and they think better of it. One by one, they hold their hands up in surrender. Hansel takes a step forward, his aim moving from one man to the next, \"You all have made a very, very big mistake,\" he says, his voice hard and steady despite the rage he can feel building under his skin. \"The boy is a witch!\" One of the men, their apparent leader, attempts to defend their actions. \"You idiots really think he has magic? Why the hell would he just sit here and let you torture him for hours if he could just get the fuck away?\" \"He's healing himself!\" Another protests, daring to point at their prisoner, \"Look!\" Hansel does look. Ben still looks perilously close to death, slumped over and unaware of what's going on around him, but the cuts on him seem to be slowly knitting themselves back together, the traces of the magic he left for Ben seem to be working to repair the damage done by these heathens. With a frustrated sigh, and much to the surprise of Ben's captors, he tosses his gun to Gretel who slings it casually over her shoulder, her aim never wavering from her crossbows fixed point on the leader's head. Unarmed now, Hansel lets his magic build in the palm of his hand, the same sparking blue. \"No, I'm healing him. And you're damn lucky it's working.\" The lot of them step back in terror at the sight of his magic. \"You-you're the witch we heard about! The man who can do magic,\" the leader realizes. \"Hansel and Gretel - witches! Pretending to hunt your own horrible kind for money and power!\" His backward step has put him close to Ben, though, and he grabs a handful of the boy's blood-caked hair, \"And what of this one? Some poor fellow you enchanted to do your bidding?\" \"H-Hansel…?\" Ben mumbles out, barely conscious. He groans in pain and tries to squirm away from the hand in his hair. \"I'm here, Ben,\" he assures him, before turning his attention back to the leader. \"If you don't stop touching him I'm going to make sure you can't touch anything ever again,\" he warns, the orb of magic still resting in his palm growing both in size and the intensity of its glow. The leader pulls a knife in response to Hansel's threat, presses it to Ben's neck. \"I wouldn't,\" Gretel warns, eyes darting between her brother and the man with the blade. The others seem to want no part of this and have backed off significantly, but it likely won't be far enough. Sure enough, the blast of magic fires itself off before the man with the knife can dare to make a move. Electric blue threads shoot out from the central core and target all six of Ben's attackers at once. The magic doesn't seem to be discriminating between past threats and present threats and Hansel is sure that they are all threats of some sort (they were all here , standing over Ben, letting him be tortured) so he can't bring himself to feel too badly about it when they all try to struggle against it in vain. In less than a minute they're all on the ground, and when Gretel checks them, they're all dead. Hansel barely notices. He's already on his knees at Ben's feet, uses the leader's knife to cut through the ropes holding Ben in place, letting as much healing energy as possible leech into Ben to try to make the magic he already has work faster. \"Ben,\" he calls out, hands gently smoothing over the boys face to try to keep him awake and aware, \"You're okay, I've got you, you're okay.\" Ben reaches out for him, wincing with the movement, and Hansel pulls him in for a quick kiss before he gathers the boy in his arms so they can get the hell out of here. They make camp in the depths of the Black Forest, as far away as they can get from the castle ruins before night falls upon them once again. Their ruined supplies have left them with one usable tent, but they're all too on edge to all sleep at once anyway. Hansel sits by the fire with Ben tucked against his side while Gretel and Edward take a turn at getting some sleep. It's taken all day and most of the night thus far, and so much energy that Hansel is beyond exhausted, but he's got Ben healed almost completely. The broken bones and deep cuts have gone, mere bruises are all that's left of his physical injuries and even those are slowly fading away. \"You don't have to keep doing it, you know,\" Ben tells him, drowsy and comfortable against his side, leaning into the fingers Hansel's carding through his hair (no longer caked in blood thanks to a quick rinse in a nearby stream and a change of clothes). \"I can handle a few bumps and bruises.\" Hansel watches the faint blue sparks that jump from his skin to Ben's at random, the traces of the healing magic that haven't stopped. \"I don't even know that I'm doing it anymore. It's just kind of happening.\" Which is an interesting development, but one that they can explore later, when they're sure the consequences of Ben's rescue won't follow them out of this forest. Gretel appears a few minutes later, vacating the tent so he and Ben can get some much needed rest while she takes over guard duty. Hansel imagines she'll be a little more vigilant than either of the two of them have been. He sends Ben ahead, pulls Gretel aside for a moment, \"Thanks for everything today,\" he says, because he hasn't yet. \"Couldn't have gotten through it without you.\" \"I don't doubt that,\" she teases, offers a hug that he gladly accepts. \"And what you did to those guys at the castle? It's probably for the best that no one walked away from that and it's certainly not like they didn't deserve it for what they were doing to Ben.\" Hansel feels the same, but the reassurance from Gretel eases some of the nerves that have settled in about his magic – how easy it was to do that, how he barely had to think it before it happened and isn't even sure he could have stopped it if he'd wanted to. It's a hard trade-off between how much his magic helps him in other situations (usually with saving Ben's life, honestly) and the damage it can do in others. For now, though, he nods in agreement. \"Let's just hope no one finds the bodies for a long, long time.\" \"Go,\" she tells him. \"Sleep. We'll deal with everything else come morning.\" He does as told, slipping into the tent and curling himself around Ben, already soundly asleep, magic still dancing between them. For the first time since finding the camp in ruins, he relaxes, anchoring himself back to the real world and everything he has there.

Underage sex. You've been warned. When Gretel Connolly is nine, her dad leaves her and her brother at a bus station in Paramus. \"He's not coming back,\" Hansel whispers to her, four hours later, when the workers are starting to leave and the lights start going off. \"Just wait,\" Gretel says, and holds tightly onto him in the corner of the closet they've kept themselves safe in all this time. The shadows can't hide them for long. When the exhaustion gets to them and they fall asleep clutched in each other's arms, there's ten minutes of blissful sleep until there's a flashlight in their eyes and stern questions from a security guard. She's only nine but Gretel makes up fake names for the both of them, and while the police sort of people or whatever are running around looking for kids with the horrible names Gerta and Hanschen O'Connell, she ditches the social worker to go to the bathroom. She meets Hansel halfway there. She grins and hugs him, and he doesn't let go. They find a fire door and go through it. The alarms sound, and they never stop sounding from that point on. It's only a matter of time before they get caught, and they're split up. Gretel won't leave her brother for anything. She kicks and screams and shouts. \"H! Hansel! I'll be back for you! I promise! Don't give up on me !\" \"Never! I'll find you, G,\" Hansel shouts back. \"I promise!\" It's not a pinky swear. It's way more serious than that. It's what keeps her awake that night, hatching plans and arguing inwardly about how best to get back to her brother. Her stomach hurts when she thinks of just going to sleep and leaving him wherever he is, but she knows that this is going to take a plan. The social workers already know they're going to run. What they don't know is when. The orphanage is terrible. Gretel hates everyone there. The worst thing is really when the adults start showing up at the orphanage and taking kids away. It's not like kidnapping, it's more like getting a puppy. They make sure you have your shots and you're healthy and eating and all that stuff, and no one at the orphanage ever sees you again. It's almost like they expect you to forget everything that happened before, to forget how Mom told Dad that they had to go, like they were moving away and they had to pack their bags for a trip or something, and then just let them sit and ride away on stupid social work things like the stuffed elephant Gretel had left on a bus that one time and never saw again. Like she's going to trust another mom and dad. Like she's going to trust any other mom and dad with Hansel. Like she's going to do anything they tell her to do. \"No,\" Gretel says, steel in her voice, her arms crossed over her chest. She glowers at the social worker. \"I won't go. Not without my brother.\" The social worker purses her lips. \"Gretel, you have to understand that foster families will often take on multiple children, and don't have space for any – \" \"I don't care,\" Gretel says loudly. \"If I don't go with my brother I don't go anywhere .\" Kicking, screaming, and refusing to eat does wonders for making them take her threats seriously. Weeks later, they tell her she has a visitor, and she rolls her eyes and goes to the living room, and when she seems him it's like one of the other orphanage kids punched her in the stomach again, in the best possible way. \" Hansel ,\" she cries, and rushes into his arms. \"Told you so,\" Hansel murmurs into her ear, and hugs her tightly. \"I want to go with her,\" he speaks up to the social workers watching. There's some sort of adult conversation that Gretel doesn't care to listen to, because she's so afraid she's going to cry in front of everyone and that'll just make things worse. \"Are you okay?\" she asks him. \"I'm okay,\" Hansel whispers. \"Are you okay?\" She nods, blinking away tears. \"I'm never gonna lose you again,\" she tells him. \"No way,\" he confirms. \"I won't let you.\" She could start really crying now, like some kind of crybaby, but then the social worker is calling her name, and Hansel's, and then they're telling them about a nice lady who is interested in meeting them and maybe fostering them. She lives in a part of the city Gretel hasn't ever been, but it's not far from where they're from and maybe they can hide in the old house if Mom and Dad have really disappeared into thin air like Hansel thinks they have. \"What's her name?\" Hansel asks urgently. \"Mrs. O'Mailey,\" the social worker says. \"You'll both have to be on your best behavior. Gretel, I expect you to eat. Hansel, no fighting.\" \"They started it,\" Hansel says, defensive. \"They started it with me, too,\" Gretel says, and rolls her eyes again. \"Stupid kids.\" \"Gretel, language,\" the social worker chides her Gretel huffs. \"Come on, H. They have a TV here.\" They go, and the social workers keep talking about whatever. \"Who cares who this lady is,\" she tells Hansel. \"We'll go there, get some money, and leave.\" \"That's stealing,\" Hansel whispers back. \"How do you think we got to Queens? We stole,\" she returns. \"Do you really want a new mom?\" \"'Course not,\" he says, annoyed. \"So we pretend and then go?\" \"Exactly,\" Gretel confirms, and sits down in front of the TV with him. \"Easy as cake.\" O'Mailey is a nightmare. She tells them to call her Martha and there's no way that's happening. Hansel insists she smells weird, and not just like the licorices and candy she tries to make them eat way after the whole thing is awesome and they get sick of it. \"She smells like old chicken bones,\" he tells her finally, dead certain, on the second day. \"We gotta get out of here.\" \"You two,\" O'Mailey calls, \"always hiding! Come out, my sweets. Let's watch some television.\" Gretel grimaces, and neither answers, hoping she'll give up and go watch Murder She Wrote or something. \"Children! Hansel, Gretel, don't make me send you to bed without dinner!\" \"Chicken bones,\" Hansel mutters, and Gretel straightens. She grabs his hand and tugs him out, and smiles at the lady who isn't that old but smells like death anyway. (He's right. Chicken bones. That's what she smells like.) \"Hi. We were playing a game,\" she tells O'Mailey, with what the orphanage people always called 'her best poker face'. \"What are we going to watch?\" \"A movie,\" O'Mailey tells them, with another one of those smiles. \"Go, sit. I'll get the sweets for my sweethearts.\" Hansel presses his face into his hands when she leaves the room. \"Can't eat anymore,\" he mumbles. \"We're almost done, H,\" Gretel whispers to him. \"What do you mean?\" Hansel whispers back. \"Here we go,\" O'Mailey calls, and brings in a big plate of cookies and candy. \"Come, sit with me! I have the tape in and everything.\" Gretel gives Hansel an expectant look and they tromp over to the couch, ready to reluctantly sit through whatever to give the foster lady some reason to think they aren't going to steal half her money tomorrow. The movie's in black and white and it's all Gretel can do not to groan, and Hansel mumbles something, but then O'Mailey's nudging the plate at them. \"Go on,\" she urges them. \"Don't be shy.\" She realizes she recognizes the beginning: it's The Wizard of Oz . She actually likes this movie, and her favorite is the scarecrow. \"I don't want to,\" Hansel insists, and that snaps Gretel out of it. Oh no. \"What do you mean?\" O'Mailey asks, and they're all so close that she smells like gross sugar syrup and death and Gretel is glaring before she can stop herself. \"Don't be ungrateful, Hansel.\" \"You can't make me,\" Hansel says, defensive. \"I'll get sick and then what?\" \"You won't get sick,\" O'Mailey assures him, and smiles. Her face changes. For just a second, she looks like a monster, and Gretel immediately shoves her arm out to defend Hansel. \"I need you healthy. Robust .\" \"We're sick of sweets,\" Gretel says shortly. \"You'll eat them,\" O'Mailey says; her blue eyes are glowing and her face is almost melting and Gretel is worried she's going crazy until she sees the look on Hansel's face and the way he's shaking. \"Or you'll be punished.\" \"No,\" Gretel says, as firmly as she can, though her knees are shaking. O'Mailey casually reaches for her pocket, and draws out, with fingers way more spindly than before, a long stick of wood. The overture of The Wizard of Oz plays in the background. \"They told me you'd make this difficult,\" she says, gestures with the stick, and throws Hansel against the wall and sticks him there like he's some kind of doll. Gretel throws herself at the evil foster lady, and she gets scratched (bitten?) and shoved to the ground. There O'Mailey stands, way thinner and meaner and grosser, definitely a monster, and all Gretel can do is go with her first impulse and shout, \"Hansel! H! Are you all right?\" She spares a glance Hansel's way, and when she turns to face him and he starts to haltingly answer, something heavy slams into the back of her head and she slips into darkness. When Gretel wakes up, she finds Hansel, still knocked out, in a cage made of bones on the table, and gets blisters from Monster O'Mailey's magic wand when she dares touch it. O'Mailey sends her into what she used to call \"the sewing room,\" which doesn't even have a sewing machine in it, probably because it's full of weird roots and plants and bottles, to get different bottles and things. She's a witch. There's nothing else she can be. Gretel understands now. When Gretel brings out the last few bottles, there's a huge pot on the stove bubbling away, a bunch of saws and knives, and an entire bucket of candy. She stops dead, with enough presence of mind not to drop the bottles – who knows what the witch would do if she did? – and makes a split second decision to not panic and just figure it out . Her fear turns to rabid determination in an instant. The witch gestures impatiently for the bottles, looks at one or two, and sets them aside, pouring little bits from this bottle here and that bottle there. \"You, watch the pot, let me know when it turns blue-green,\" she snaps at Gretel. \"Hansel! Hansel, it's time to wake up.\" There's a flash of light, and Hansel blinks awake. \"It's time for dinner!\" \"No,\" Hansel mutters, still not really awake. Gretel glances between the pot and Hansel, doing her best to keep an eye on everything, including possible escape routes that include running away from a lady who can do magic spells, which was not something she'd considered before. \"Yes,\" the witch insists, and grabs him through the cage by the neck, shoving candy into his mouth. He has no option but to chew, Gretel realizes, when there's so much and she doesn't let him spit. He's coughing and gagging and starting to cry, and that's when she decides the witch has to die. Hansel looks past the witch, at her, and she nods to him, grim, encouraging. There has to be something. When she looks at the pot, on tiptoes, to check on the color, she sees that the oven is on, too. \"Are you making cookies?\" she asks, pretending to be excited. \"I'm making pot pies,\" the witch says, more concerned with Hansel at this point. \"Once this one's all ready, he'll make a good tender meat, and his blood... so sweet.\" \"No,\" Hansel protests, through a mouthful of sweets. \"Please no – \" Soon , Gretel mouths at Hansel. Wait . \"Are you going to eat me too?\" she asks the witch, cautious. \"Later,\" the witch says, dismissive. \"I'll make use of you until then.\" You're not going to eat my brother , Gretel wants to say, but she has to wait, no matter how hard it is to watch Hansel suffering and choking. The oven finally makes that clicking sound, and she gestures to Hansel while mouthing, Push . She climbs onto the stepstool, and Hansel shoves himself forward to push the witch into Gretel's path, and she shrieks and hurls abuse at him just before Gretel uses all her strength to push the pot of boiling whatever over, and on top of the witch. She screams. She screams bloody murder, and Hansel is still trapped in the cage, now on the floor, panting and backing away from the boiling potion spilling all over the linoleum. Gretel hurries to let him out, the potion sloshing around her ankles; she ignores it, the pain, and runs across the wet floor to pull open the oven, snatching the magic wand on her way. \"Help me,\" she calls to Hansel, hauling the witch, who's blindly grasping for her wand where it used to be, up as best she can. With Hansel's help, they shove her facefirst into the oven. She screams and screams into the back of the oven, all muffled, and eventually the screams are shorter and finally she goes limp. Gretel looks at Hansel, his face pale and stained with all sorts of candy colors, and says evenly, \"Let's get our stuff. It's time to run.\" The second day they're on the run, Hansel sees their faces on TV. It's a suspected murder and kidnapping now, and Gretel is more than happy to let everyone think that. The other option is that they'll get blamed and thrown into prison and there's no way she's going to let that happen. That week is a blur of stealing and crossing state lines, of scavenging for food, hiding from adults and cops, and finding warm places to sleep. They're doing just fine until Gretel goes back to check on Hansel and he's asleep and he won't wake up. She doesn't have the time to cry, even though she wants to. She steals a shopping cart and hauls him to a homeless shelter they've been avoiding going into, and finally bursts into tears when they realize what's happening. He's sick. They can wake him up. But he's sick and he'll never get better. It's a disease called diabetes, and he has to poke himself with needles and eat the right things or he'll fall asleep and die. Gretel knows who to blame. Monster O'Mailey. She'd kill her again if she could, and a third time too. It's not as easy, then. Hansel has to eat, every day, every meal. He needs insulin. There's almost no way to be on the run and away from shelters, until Gretel realizes what she has to do. She has to steal it. She practices picking locks. She breaks into a Walgreens and grabs as much insulin and syringes as she can, and a cooler and ice to pack it all up with. It goes into their collection of things to haul around, even if it's more conspicuous. Gretel doesn't care. Her brother is alive. \"You're always saving me,\" Hansel murmurs to her when she's giving him another injection. \"That's what family does,\" she reminds him, and leans over to kiss his cheek. \"Love you,\" he says. \"Love you too.\" Over the next three months they practice their pickpocketing and lockpicking. Gretel becomes really, really good at the locks, Hansel is better at pickpocketing, but both are getting really good at cornering kids and politely asking for their money while holding something heavy. Sure, they're only almost eleven, but they're homeless and probably going to kid jail if they get caught, so they have like nothing to lose. Plus, they've gotten really good at hitting things (or people) really hard. They're eating sandwiches made from stolen bread and cheese, and sharing an apple, when a lady shows up in the park and carefully approaches them. Gretel eyes her without actually making eye contact, and gives Hansel a signal, and they ignore her in hopes that she'll go away. No one can be trusted. Anyone could be one of them. If a witch can get a couple of kids hand-delivered to her by the State of New York, there's literally no way there aren't witches just wandering the parks hoping to find kids like them. \"Are you two all right?\" the lady says, and Gretel ignores her. \"Shouldn't you be in school?\" \"We're off of school,\" Hansel says simply. \"If you two are in trouble, I know a place you could go,\" the lady goes on, and holds out a piece of paper. Gretel looks up only for a second, and rolls her eyes. \"My name is Molly. I work at a shelter. It's a safe place. It's warm. We have food, and clothes.\" \"We have clothes,\" Hansel interrupts her, annoyed. Gretel cuts in, too. \"Our dad wouldn't like you talking to us.\" \"Where is your dad right now?\" the lady asks gently. \"He's busy,\" Gretel says. \"We're having lunch. Can you leave us alone?\" \"Please. Take this,\" the lady presses, and drops the paper in Gretel's lap. \"Just in case you need a place to stay.\" Neither of them answers her, so she leaves. When she's definitely out of earshot, Gretel says, \"We need to get in a bathroom. And wash our clothes. They can tell we're homeless.\" \"We should leave Dover, too,\" Hansel says, and makes a face back at Gretel. \"I know you like it here but they're going to send stupid social workers after us next, if they know we're here.\" \"Yeah.\" Gretel sighs, and eats the last bite of her sandwich. \"We have enough money, I think. Where do you want to go?\" Hansel considers that. \"Trenton.\" That makes Gretel pause. \"It's so close to home.\" \"We've been in Delaware too long anyway.\" \"You're right.\" She sighs, and hugs Hansel around the neck. \"We're gonna make it, H.\" \"I know.\" He hugs her back. \"Because of you.\" She holds him tightly. \"I wouldn't have made it without you either,\" she whispers. He nudges out of the hug some, and she moves to back off, slightly more cheerful, but he stops her by putting his hand over hers on his leg. She looks up at him, questioning, and he moves awkwardly to kiss her on the lips. She's more surprised than anything, and it shows on her face, she knows by the look on his face, but she smiles once it's become real. He relaxes, then, and she rests against his shoulder. \"Five sound okay?\" she asks him. \"Yeah,\" he confirms, and takes her hand in his. They're not homeless. This is their home, together. Gretel's lost count of how many pharmacies she's broken into. All she knows is this is not her last one, no matter how long she's going to be stuck in \"juvie,\" as they call jail for kids. She has the presence of mind to give fake names again. There's no way for them to be identified, probably, so it should work, at least for a few months. \"Leave me alone,\" she tells the social worker, loudly and pointedly. \"It'll only be a few months, Greta. You can visit with your brother – maybe you'll even go to the same foster home,\" the social worker says, all encouraging. \"Great,\" Gretel says, all sarcastic. \"I love foster homes.\" \"It's not safe for Harry to be a runaway, hon,\" the social worker tries. \"And you can't steal from businesses like that. It's against the law.\" \"Shut up,\" Gretel says, evenly. \"It's not safe for us to be in freaking foster homes, either.\" That makes the social worker pause. \"What happened in the foster home, dear?\" \"Why do you care? I'm going to juvie.\" \"Well,\" the social worker starts, and Gretel decides she doesn't care. As usual, she just has to wait for the right time. Then, and only then, she can get Hansel back. The girls in juvie hate her. They hate her more than anyone in the orphanages ever did, and she's lucky that she learned how to fight already, because she's breaking noses and knocking out teeth without much of a problem, no matter if she winds up in therapy and being chastised and chided for it. \"Who cares?\" she tells all of the adults who bother her. \"I did what I did, I'm here, why do you care if I stop fighting or what?\" \"Because it's not healthy,\" the therapist says. \"And we're worried about you, Greta.\" \"Go to hell,\" she decides to start saying. It turns out that punching one of the wardens was not a good idea, and she curses herself for it when she gets three more months in juvie for it, waiting until late, late at night to cry in the bathroom. Hansel. She can't stand the thought of him waiting for her, or, worse, happily settling in with some family away from her, one that can take care of him and provide and get him insulin whenever he needs it. It hurts, physically, like someone's carved her heart out of her chest and she's just bleeding and trying to breathe. She doesn't feel like she's going to survive this, the not knowing, the way her world is falling apart. She stops fighting except in self-defense. She stops refusing to eat, shouting at the therapists, glowering at the wardens. She just keeps her poker face on and lies to the therapists, giving them all sort of fake clues to follow. Eventually, they let her out. She demands a chance to visit Hansel (or Harry, or whatever), and reads the address upside down on the paperwork. He's still at the orphanage. This should be easy. It's been six months, and Gretel's stomach is roiling as she looks in each bedroom ( oh god, he thinks I'm gone, he's safe with everyone else and I'm a terrible sister, I should just ). But when she looks into the fourth one, bringing a slash of light into the room with her, she sees Hansel, and his eyes open, and he grins at her. It takes a distraction to steal the insulin and break into the lockbox full of money, but Gretel planned for that. They're on the run again. They spend the night on the trains, transferring as often as they can, until morning. They share a kiss again in an empty car, again, again. They're too happy to care about what this means, what they've done. They're together . It's Hansel who brings it up, while they're huddled in a refrigerator box in the cold of early April. \"The witches,\" he says. \"What about the witches?\" \"What about them?\" Gretel sighs. \"That's why I didn't want you to go into that damn orphanage.\" \"They're probably eating other kids,\" Hansel points out. \"Or making them do things, or hurting them however. We should stop them.\" Gretel opens her mouth to answer him, then shuts it, thinking. \"Then we could take their stuff,\" she says. \"We wouldn't have to run around and...\" \"We could survive on it,\" Hansel agrees. He's beside himself with this idea. \"And it'd be a good thing, we wouldn't be criminals and – \" \"We need weapons,\" she says, rapidly. \"And, and we have to do research.\" \"Do you think there's really research?\" \"At least the library's warm,\" she says, and grins. Their research at the library doesn't turn up much except about how to kill witches, but they find a reference to a book on how to find witches, and they eventually find that book by calling a bunch of occultist bookstores. It's way easier to hunt them then. Their second witch is a nurse who poisons kids to make them look dead and then takes them home to do some sort of experiments on them. They cut her head off, and release the kids. They take her money, her checkbook, all of the clothes that fit Gretel, and as much food as they can reasonably carry in their backpacks. They sell everything else, and get as far away as they can. Their third witch works at a homeless shelter, and their fourth and fifth work at a juvie hall. It figures , Gretel thinks. It takes all the way up until the fifth witch, who seems to know what they're planning, for them to realize that the real magic curses, the ones they've read about, don't work on them. It would explain the surprised looks on the witches' faces. But it's weird. None of the books explain it. They kill three more witches in New England, then they're pointed way more inland than they've ever been before. The enchanted map says Ohio. So they go to Ohio. It's not like they spend a lot of time watching TV, because TV is for people with houses. At one point, though, they get a chance to hang out in one of the witches' apartments in December (after stabbing her in an alley, putting her in a dumpster, and setting it ablaze; fire is the best, surest way to kill them, they've learned). Her TV is huge, and awesome, so they hang out there for an hour or two, and that's when they see the local news. \"Turn it off,\" Hansel complains. \"Shut up,\" Gretel tells him, and watches raptly as a graphic appears in the corner of the screen: \"The Ladykiller Arsonist.\" \"Who cares,\" Hansel asks, annoyed. \"I want to watch some action movies, and she has HBO.\" \"You just want to see boobs,\" Gretel says, dismissive. \" Listen .\" She has a bad feeling about this, especially when they show a map with all of the victims of this arsonist. Hansel's watching now, too, his eyes wider. \"I told you we needed to watch this,\" she says. \"Will this killer's rampage of terror be brought to an end before he makes his way across the country?\" the newscaster asks. \"The FBI are working towards that goal exactly.\" \"They think we're a guy,\" Gretel says, amused. \"I'm a guy,\" Hansel points out. \"You're a boy!\" \"I am not a boy,\" he argues. \"I'm thirteen.\" \"I think you're a boy,\" Gretel says, and smirks at his expression. \"We should go. They won't have identified her yet, and we already have a location.\" \"Ugh,\" Hansel complains, looking at the map. \"Really?\" \"Look at it this way,\" Gretel says. \"At least Louisiana is warm. Full of stuff for us to do.\" \"Yeah. Witches. That's what I'm worried about,\" he says, dryly, and seeks out her hand. \"Let's show those bitches.\" She laughs at that, and squeezes his hand. \"First we pack. Then, New Orleans.\" After dispatching only one sabbath's worth of witches and four others, they leave the rest of the witches at work in Louisiana because the feds are going to catch on eventually. The thing is, it seems neverending. They can't flee across the Canadian border. It'd be a hell of a lot of work to cross the Mexican border, and the brujas there are brutal if the lore pans out. The FBI isn't nearly as hot on their trail as they like to think – they probably think there's a pattern because they're serial killers and they're trying to make a point, but it'd be way more sense if they treated them like exterminators – and the cops have basically no idea that they're kids until much later. There's evidence, and a possible witness, the national news says. They think the killers are teenagers, maybe Satanists. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" Hansel says, staring at the TV. \"We should pretend to make one a sacrifice,\" Gretel deadpans. \"You're so morbid,\" Hansel says, a little appalled. She punches his arm. \"It's a joke, dumbass.\" They grin at each other. Two days later, they have sketches that look sort of, but not exactly, like them, up on the news. Hansel makes fun of Gretel's – her nose is off-center – but she just points out that she's the prettiest girl Hansel's ever kissed, and that shuts him up. Six months later, there's a book out. Satan's Handmaiden and Death's Apprentice . They see it in the library when they're researching marsh witches in Wisconsin, and page through it in interest and amusement. Probably the reasonable thing to do is be worried, but they're not. Not even slightly. \"I like it,\" Gretel confesses, looking at the cover, the drawing of the pale girl with long dark hair hand in hand with her tall, strong accomplice. \"Yeah,\" Hansel says, and tangles his fingers with Gretel's. Her face grows warm. \"Me, too.\" Two years and thirty witches later, there's a movie. The posters are everywhere. The news is aghast at the whole thing, the murders, the continuing rampage, the commercialization and sensationalism and blah blah blah. They go online at the nearest library, check the usual websites, and there's a forum. I think my neighbor's a witch , the first one is titled, and all the rest are similar. Someone's killing kids in my town. We keep finding bones in campfires at the state park. No one wants to talk about it. It happened before, and it's getting worse. Help us, they all say. Wherever you are. We know you're there. Please help us. \"Hansel,\" Gretel breathes, and clutches at his arm. He looks back at her with the same stunned, confused mix of emotions in his eyes, and they start to frantically write down everything posted there, ready to investigate and kill those bitches. Once they're home in the cheap hotel room, she curls up against him on the bed, sedate and comfortable and still in shock. \"They know, H,\" she whispers. \"They get it.\" \"We're the good guys,\" he says, and presses a kiss to her temple. \"We've done good.\" \"And we're gonna do more,\" she says, tracing a finger along his shoulder. \"Are you excited?\" \"Yeah,\" he says, his gaze close on her, as though she's the only thing in this world that matters. It excites her more than it should, but she doesn't care. To everyone else, what they do, what they are, is wrong. But they don't know the truth. It's impossible to tell who really initiated the kiss, but it's different, so different. There's a heat in it, a desperation and need. She crawls on top of him, fervently kissing him again and again, murmuring his name between kisses, and when he touches the bare line of skin exposed on her back, she leans into him in a way that makes him groan. She strips her shirt away from her skin that feels as aflame as one of the many witches they've brought down, and they lose control. He rushes out of the door once they realize what's going to happen, what's inevitable, and it's the best kind of agony until he comes back. This is Hansel and Gretel. Hansel&Gretel.; When she slides the condom onto him, kisses him slow and languid, and pours herself onto him all maddeningly slow, no matter the pain, it's everything they've ever known was right. This is home. They are home. ","Summary":" Modern AU Hansel/Gretel set in America in the '90s. Underage sex. You've been warned.

Trying to get that back up, admittedly, but it's… a slow going process. *sighs* Apologies for any who's actually heard of this blog. -0- Benjamin shook with fear and worry as he stared at the three witches in front of him. He was currently tied up, in a chair, helpless. Of course, when was he ever not helpless? Ben shook his head at the thoughts currently crowding his head and tried to get rid of the numb feeling in his hands. He kind of wished someone would come rescue him. Though he knew that none of the townspeople would come to his rescue, since none of them cared enough about him to do so, that didn't mean that a certain pair of witch hunters would stand by idly while he got eaten. \"Hansel…\" Benjamin whispered to himself, feeling a bit pathetic when tears pricked the corners of his eyes. Still… he had faith in his best friend and in his lover… but it was true how faith can only carry someone so far. \"Hansel… please …\" Ben lowered his head slightly and closed his eyes tightly, willing the tears away. \"Please come and rescue me…\" he added, his voice still a hushed whisper. Despite that, however, faith was all he had- faith and love- that Hansel would come and save him. And that was all he needed. Steeling himself up now, he was far more than confident that Hansel would come save him, and that all he had to do was wait. He smiled lightly at this thought and somehow, he wasn't surprised when one of the witches caught sight of it, turning her attention to him. \"What are you smiling about?\" she sneered and he finally looked up at her, taking in the sight that were the witches that had captured him one last time and his smile suddenly became dark as he imagined their heads detached from their bodies and blood covering the surface of the ground beneath them and the trees around them. \"My boyfriend is going to come rescue me…\" he stated, loud and clear; a taunt, he knew, but he couldn't help it, \"and when he does, you're all going to die.\" ","Summary":" White Wolf Fan Fiction Presents: ~Faith~ A Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters Story Title: Faith Word"},{"Movie":"Hansel & Gretel","Title":"That Night","Author":"Commander Fiction","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11707656","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A Hansel and Gretel Fiction \"For the siblings that slay the evil witches, and their sibling goals that all siblings wished they had. Also they're pretty frick'n badass if you ask me.\" That Night The only Chapter (cos it's a oneshot and it's my first one, please be nice ) The hardwood floor made his back ache as he tossed and turned in his sleep. The floorboards silently let out their complaints in groans. Gretel was laying upon the four inch-thick mattress that barely served its purpose. She was gazing at her brother, listening to every shuddering breath he took in his haunted slumber. It was only days after the battle they had fought against Muriel, and he was having problems about Mina's death. It scared him. Never had Hansel gotten so close to another human being besides his sister, and that person died. Gretel knew he would get over it. He would move on, she just didn't know how long he would dwell upon it. A sudden groan made her gather her thoughts and bring her attention back to the living. Gently she looked at her brother, endless love and compassion for him behind her gleaming eyes. Slowly the drowsy Hansel rolled over onto his left side and stared up at her. Gretel gave him a warm welcoming smile, Hansel tried to do the same, but his lips twitched and his eyes watered. Kindly she reached her hand down and stroked the sides of his worn face. Hansel usually would have pushed away her sympathetic hand, but for once he left behind his heartless warrior exterior and let himself give in to her comfort. No words could express her feeling towards him as she quietly played with his matted hair, staring into his benevolent eyes. He wanted to say so much, to tell her everything, but the only sound that squeezed through his chapped lips was a whimper. Gretel's heart instantly broke, but she didn't show it. She needed to be strong. For him. She then sat up, swinging her legs onto the cold wooden floor. Gretel stood up and came beside him without causing the boards to creak. Hansel's sister bent down and scooped him from the floor, bringing him into a reassuring hug. Hansel gave in immediately and hugged her back, arms wrapping around her. Gretel would have liked to stay there forever, but she heard a slight yawn whisper through her brother's lips. She smiled and brought him to his feet. The two of them then crashed into the bed, which was definitely to small for Hansel, let alone two people. Despite the tiny bed, they managed to cuddle up onto it. Gretel had her arms wrapped around Hansel as his head rested upon her shoulder. \"What will we do Gretel?\" Hansel suddenly asked, his voice sounding hoarse and broken with despair. \"I don't know . . . I guess we'll just keep doing what we've been doing. Maybe go to a different town. Travel some more.\" She replied honestly, placing her hand back into his hair and playing with it. \"Hmm, I kind of like this place.\" He admitted and Gretel chuckled. \"Well we can stay a bit longer.\" Gretel informed him and kissed his forehead, bringing out a soft smile on his face. Hansel shifted slightly as he sighed with his thoughts slowly fading his mind. \"Sweet dreams brother.\" Gretel whispered feeling his breath upon her cheek. \"Sweet dreams sis.\" Hansel managed to mutter before falling into his slumber, only this time comfortably rested against Gretel's reassuring presence. \"Hmm.\" She moaned, feeling his grip around her waist tightened as be began to dream about his fears. His right leg shifting over her thighs, bringing their bodies ever closer. \"Oh brother what would you do without me?\" Gretel sighed gazing down at him. It worried her to see him like this. So defenseless, frightened, weak. It was like he was a child again, feeling the pain and agony of responsibility upon his shoulders. Gretel shut her eyes after a few moments, letting the darkness consume her thoughts. The next time she awoke, Hansel was beginning to thrash, shaking the bed. Gretel's eyes peeled open and she accepted the blackness that her blanketed her eyes. Hansel on the other hand was still asleep, his timer for his sugar sickness ticking away as time ran out. Out of worry and fear for her brother, she sprung up and shook him awake. \"Hansel wake up!\" She cried, grabbing his shoulders and shaking him until she could see the slight reflection of light bouncing off of his eyes. \"Huhmm.\" He groaned, his head spinning and his head burning with headache. \"Where is your shots?\" She demanded, unable to remember where he had placed them before bed. \"Table.\" Hansel mumbled his body trembling underneath her. \"Right.\" She grumbled and leaped off the bed and went for the table. Desperately her hands went across the surface, searching for his leather casing for his medication. Finally after a few moments of frantic searching her hands grasped onto the leather pouch and she brought it over to her convulsing sibling. \"Shh, hold still.\" Gretel told him, brushing his face with her left hand as her right gripped onto his thigh. Clenching her teeth, Gretel thrust the needle into her brother's thigh and pushed the liquid into his body. After a few seconds of shuddering, Hansel finally eased backed down. His muscles loosened up and he let out a sigh. \"Thanks.\" Hansel managed to mumble through a fit of coughing. Gretel climbed back into bed beside him, stress radiating off of her breast. She knew Hansel hated it when she felt responsible for his sugar sickness, but she hated it when Hansel blamed it on himself. They basically took turns scowling at themselves, but mostly Hansel. Like a angel, Gretel began to hum the song their mother used to sing to them before their bedtime. Hansel found great comfort in the peaceful music. Unfortunately that didn't stop his body from hiccupping every few moments. Every time he hiccupped his body jolted, causing the bed to moan its annoyance. Gretel instead of getting infuriated with the noise automatically began to lull him back to his slumber, but she had no luck. Hansel's eyes remained wide open, his attention focusing on the clattering window that was being slammed from the picking up storm. Gradually Gretel sat up, turning her body so she could lean against the wall. Hansel sat up and did the same, arms crossed as he hiccupped. \"Here, let me close the window.\" Hansel muttered and began to move. \"Wait no!\" Gretel replied and grabbed him around his chest. Shakily, Hansel collapsed onto her lap and fought her comfort, but she still clung onto to him. \"It's alright, rest.\" Gretel told him, stroking his brown hair that was covered in sweat. \"It's not alright . . . Gretel . . ?\" Hansel choked up, his breath caught in his throat. \"Shh, go on, tell me.\" She soothed, her other hand placed on his chest so he could hold it. \"Mina, she's gone, and it's all my fault.\" Hansel said, biting his lower lip after doing so. \"It wasn't anybody's fault, she made her decision Hansel.\" Gretel responded, her hand pausing in his hair as she thought about it, then continued as he coughed. \"You're right.\" Hansel sighed, but his words were blunt. Gretel knew he didn't believe the words that's left his mouth, but he would soon. She knew he would get over it, maybe it was just a phase. As they both eased back down into the sheets, she saw the silent tears that streamed down his cheeks and landed onto the worn out blankets. For comfort Hansel wrapped himself back into Gretel's arms, half of his body on top of hers, his head comfortably on her breast. Yeah, he was spoiled. With a sigh Gretel shut her eyes after she saw Hansel do the same. She still felt the tears leave from his face and onto her breast but she pretended not to notice because she didn't want him to leave. Also if Hansel needed to talk about it more he would, or at least she would notice. Even with the window banging with the rainstorm, the siblings slept through the rest of the night. Hansel was no longer brought into his nightmares for the rest of the night which brought Gretel a sense of peace until morning. When Gretel awoke, again, morning light streamed from the open window. Hansel was still in his deep sleep. His head resting upon her chest, his arm wrapped underneath her boobs, and his leg between hers. Her morning couldn't have started off any better.

Character death. Don't like don't read. The knife bites into her skin and she swallows the hiss that rises up into her throat. There is no satisfaction in giving voice to her pain, she has learned this in recent days. To her surprise there is no relief to be found in the reality of the action rather than its anticipation. The pain means nothing to her but she finds clarity in the spill of her blood, in the way it trickles into the palm of her hand, glittering like spilled garnets in the moonlight. Teeth set firmly into her lip, she waits for the stinging pain to subside, for the warm rush that she knows will follow. This isn't her first time bleeding beneath the night sky; it isn't her tenth. She waits for the euphoric high to wash over her. She lives in the pain now, arching defiantly beneath the moon as her blood flows or her skin is bruised by the hands of her enemies. Tonight it is different though, tonight it is her own hand that does the damage. The blood flows steadily and she closes her eyes, adrift on the sensory pleasure of the experience. She breathes in the smell of it on the air, out of place among the familiar scents of the forest, and she takes in a deep shuddery breath. She never imagined going like this, never imagined that she would be alone. Blood is the river of memory and she spills hers in supplication and in penance for her perceived failures. She makes her dark offering, commits her final sin, because really she has nothing left to live for. Her work in this world is done and she would rather follow her brother than live her life as a long and elaborate eulogy to his memory. All it took to bring their partnership to an end was one arrow. One single arrow fired by an enemy that pierced flesh and muscle, coming to rest deep within the soft tissues of his chest. His fear was communicated in the widening of his eyes, a mental 'oh shit' that she had felt physically as he staggered and fell, a metal spike of panic in her chest that drove the air out of her lungs. She can still see it when she closes her eyes, the memory replaying on a constant loop, depriving her of even a single happy memory of their lives together. He cried in the end, a fearsome mix of tears and blood staining them both and soaking into the fabric of his shirt. She remembers the words that wouldn't come, the way he looked up at her as his body trembled in her grip. She remembers lying to him and telling him that he was going to be fine, his grip on her hand that grew weaker by the moment. Hansel took his last breath in her arms. Her own scream, wordless, primal, was the only sound to accompany his passing. Alone, quietly bleeding, Gretel waits. She has always known that life without Hansel is no life for her, that in losing her twin she would lose a part of herself. They have always been together, from their earliest days wrapped around one another in their mother's womb to the years spent fighting back to back and shoulder to shoulder. Without his presence to guide her, she is lost. Without her protector, her hero, she feels as if she cannot breathe. They are twins, they were meant to live and die side by side. One of them was never meant to be left behind when the other fell. The throbbing in her forearms finds cadence with the beating of her heart as she watches the stars. All is calm, inside and out. Darkness beckons, calling to her in the voices of those she has lost; her mother's voice on the wind, her brother's voice in her mind. She surrenders to it, staring up at a moon that has played witness to so much of her suffering and offering up a silent prayer though she knows that God hasn't listened to her for years. Darkness comes like the end of the world and she embraces it, feels her heart stuttering within her chest, fluttering like a bird as she grows cold. Palms up in supplication she smiles and closes her eyes. Waiting. It isn't the first time she's bled beneath the moon, it isn't the tenth, but it will be the last.

PLEGARIA Se podría creer que el hecho de que uno se dedique a cazar y matar brujas haría que vieras las cosas más terroríficas y por supuesto las más absurdas, estúpidas y depravadas de la tierra. Digo eso de poner de florero un cráneo y en lugar de flores las manos de tus victimas, creo que habla por sí solo. El problema no radica en lo que uno pueda ver respecto a lo vil que puede se llegar a ser un individuo, creo que todos lidiamos con demonios internos y eso es precisamente lo que más me asusta. Por qué ahora no hay monstruos a los cuales derrotar, No hay niños perdidos, Ni mujeres que desaparecen misteriosamente. No hay rituales que detener y claro No hay brujas que lancen algún hechizo. ¡Bueno, si, hay una! aquella que ha lanzado el hechizo más poderoso que ni la protección de mi madre puede repeler, la bruja que lanzo su poderoso hechizo sobre mi se llama Gretel. Bien pueden empezar a burlarse cuando quieran… No se contenga, ¡vamos… sigo esperando! ¡Oh! Ya sé, mejor me van a llamar monstruo, porque eso es lo que soy, el más vil, el más bajo, él de la peor calaña. ¡oh pero bueno, creo que todavía no les he dicho que es lo que he hecho! Valla tonto de mi Cómo espero que ustedes sepan , si yo mismo no se qué mierdas me pasa, pero les contare. Para nadie es un secreto que mi hermana Gretel y yo somos muy unidos, digo cuántos niños son abandonados en un bosque a la mitad de la noche, para luego encontrar una casa de dulce y en ella una bruja que te quiera comer, digo cuantas historias escuchas así, creo que no muy a menudo. Esta experiencia nos hizo consientes a mi hermana y a mí de lo frágil que puede ser la vida humana, incluida la de nosotros. Eso hizo que ambos nos cuidarnos mutuamente mucho. Cuando éramos niños incluso nos bañábamos juntos por seguridad, dormíamos juntos, comíamos juntos, jugamos juntos y bueno muchas cosas las hacíamos juntos. Pero una vez comenzamos a crecer y notar algunas cambios que se sucintaban optábamos porque uno se bañara y el otro vigilara. Fue un cambio que a mí en lo particular me costó asimilar, digo éramos hermanos no había nada de malo en ver una que otra cosa, literalmente éramos uno, pero al cabo de algunos meses incluso yo pensé que era una buena idea e incluso sugerí que empezáramos a dormir separados. En ese momento no le agrado nada a Gretel que sugiriera eso. (-¿eres estúpido o qué?- ) si eso dijo ¡oh! bueno para términos más específicos me lo grito al mismo tiempo que me echaba de la habitación en la noche que ambos cumplimos 15 años, pero que podía hacer digo un hombre tiene cosas que no serian muy bien vista por una mujer y mucho menos por tu hermana, como por ejemplo esos despertares matutinos de todo varón, no son fáciles de ocultar y menos cuando están en la misma cama y con su rostro muy cerca del mío. Una vez que pasamos por el complicado y bochornoso asunto de la pubertad, sentí que había perdido algo, pensé que aquella intimidad que compartíamos de niños se esfumo y de cierta manera lo hizo, pero una vez que nos distanciamos mas por cuestiones fisiologías que sentimentales, algo paso, de una u otra manera otro sentimiento nació en mi acercándome a ella de una manera tan fuerte que aun hoy me da miedo… aquella fuerza que me mantiene atado a mi mundo, a lo único que podía atar mi cordura, mi alma, mi se entero y era el amor a mi hermana. Si ¡AMOR! Pero en ese momento pensé que era el amor fraternal y las circunstancias que nos obligaron a unirnos sobre manera, lo que me llevaba a que mi mundo y toda su función giraron en torno a ella. Siempre supe que Gretel seria y es muy hermosa, nunca cuestione aquello, a pesar del pacto que hicimos sobre no hablar sobre nuestros padres aun tenia y aun conservo vagos recuerdos de mi madre y en ellos siempre aparece como una mujer complemente hermosa, por eso nunca cuestione y no me equivoque sobre la belleza de Gretel aun de niña. Con su piel blanca como la leche fresca, y su boca pequeña y roja como una fresa, su cabello color chocolate que brilla con el sol y aquel par de ojos avellana. Siempre fui consciente de su belleza y creo no ser el único, a cada pueblo donde vamos todos los hombres pueden notarlo, figura fina y fuerte y ese porte firme que a más de uno habra intimidado,claro menos a mí, porque yo la conozco, porque sé que le gustan las fresas más que cualquier cosa en el mundo, porque cuando esta ebria de la por abrasar a la gente que tiene a su lado (claro siempre procuro ser yo quien este junto a ella) porque soy yo el que ve sus mejillas rojas como rosas cuando corre y claro porque yo soy el que mira y cuenta sus pestañas cuando duerme, tan tierna, indefensa e inocente, soy yo el único al que le confiaría su sueño sin reparo, porque podría yo incluso en este momento apuñalarla, estrangularla dormida como se encuentra ahora a mi lado y ella jamás lo sospecharía porque sus armas están fuera de su alcance porque se muestra vulnerable a mí y solo a mí. Muchos hombres se acercaban a ella, unos con buenas y otros con pésimas intenciones que no podían ocultar, pero en medio siempre estuve, yo sabia y se perfectamente que Gretel el capaz de defenderse, digo alguien que sabe usar la ballesta y los cuchillos tan bien como ella es de cuidado, pero siempre estaba ese sentimiento de no dejar que nadie la dañara que nadie la tocara, claro salvo yo. En un principio la punzada que sentía en mi pecho cuando ella hablaba con otro hombre aunque solo fuera para pedir indicaciones la confundí con celos de hermano, era yo quien debía de defender su honra de mujer en ausencia de un padre, aunque ella sola lo hacía muy bien, yo tenía que cuidar a mi pequeña hermana de cualquier vago, patán o mal viviente que osara siquiera poner sus ojos sobre ella, ya ni que decir de sus manos ¡yo era su hermano! Tenía el derecho ¡¿no?! ¡Tenía la obligación! De cuidar y velar por su felicidad, ese es el trabajo del hermano mayor. Por eso apartaba a cualquiera que preguntaba por ella, nadie era lo suficientemente digno. Gretel merecía lo mejor, alguien que la hiciera feliz, que la hiciera reír, cantar, que le diera lo que ella se merecía sin importar como, porque su sola sonrisa valía que arriesgaran sus vidas, pero a mis ojos nadie cumplía con lo requerido, ni siquiera podía imaginar que alguien se llevara a mi hermana lejos de mí, porque para eso era yo su hermano. Aunque bueno, esos pensamientos eran con los que me consolaban y me los repetía una y otra vez cuando sentía que podía haber ahuyentado a algún tipo que pudiera darle una vida tranquila a ella, lejos de brujas, cuchillos, ballestas y peligros, pero no me sumía demasiado en ellos. Después de todo era yo el que debía de cuidar y velar por ella, solo yo. Hoy en día tengo que dejar de mentirme a mí mismo, no son celos de hermano si no celos de hombre y eso es lo que más preocupa. Hay momentos en los cuales su atracción me vuelve casi loco, cuando se acerca y me abraza estrechándome entre sus delgados brazos, cuando me da el beso de las buenas noches, cuando viene a buscarme para una misión, cuando se cuelga a mi espalda y noto lo bajita que es, todo en ella me atrae, me enloquece. Una brasa de la fogata que chasqueo me saco de mi ensimismamiento, entonces fui consciente del ligero peso que estaba sobre mi pierna, Gretel estaba dormida, tranquila y serena, su cabello estaba un poco alborotado pero ahí, iluminada por la tenue luz de la fogata sus finas facciones se veía más definidas, sus suaves labios entre abiertos emanaba su cálido aliento y entonces con el impulso de un niño, toco sus labios con las yemas de mis dedos, lo más suave que me permito para no turbar el dulce sueño que estoy seguro tiene, pues la tenue sonrisa dibujada en sus labios es muestra de ello, toda ella es tan suave, tan inocente muy a pesar de que sus manos sean letales, prodigan las más genuinas caricias con ternura. Una voz en mi cabeza me dice que me incline un poco para poder posar mis labios sobre los suyos y de verdad estoy tentado a hacerlo ¿quiero saber si son dulces como las fresas que tanto le gustan? ¿quiero saber si son cálidos como el fuego? pero tengo que juntar toda mi voluntad para evitar hacerlo, me limito simplemente a acariciar su cabello largo una y otra vez mientras miro de vez en cuando a los lados solo para hacer guardia, o fingir que la estoy haciendo. Justo en este momento es cuando me doy cuenta de lo egoísta que soy, si tan solo pudiéramos quedarnos en este bosque por el resto de nuestras vidas, yo podría hacerla feliz. Porque solo yo la conozco y estaría dispuesto a entregar mi vida por ella sin cuestionarme nunca nada. -las noches ahora son muy silenciosas- su suave voz me sorprende, la miro y noto que ha hablado con los ojos cerrados. -¿los extrañas?- pregunto haciendo a un lado el fleco de su frente, pues se a que se refiere... -un poco- dice. – Uno llega a encariñarse con las personas después de un tiempo- este comentario me dolió mas de lo que realmente esperaba, el solo pensar que Simon llegase a gustarle hace que duela el pecho, soy consciente de que me tenso ante el comentario. –era como tener un par de mascotas revoltosas- ríe ella y es entonces cuando abre sus hermosos ojos, en la obscuridad se ven opacos, pero brillan como si fuesen estrellas, y yo…yo solo puedo hacer uso a todo mi auto control para no besarla. En lugar de eso simplemente desvió la mirada al cielo anhelando por un momento ser solo un hombre que no fuera su hermano para poder amarla como yo deseo. -mañana llegaremos al poblado mas cercano y una semana después podremos llegar a Budapets – dije alejándome un poco para recuperar el control. No la miro, necesito alejarme por unos momentos para que su rostro no sea una tentación. -si, mañana- escuche decir. -y eso es bueno porque apestas- le digo tratando de bromear, porque me sentía incapaz de seguir un hilo de conversación que no fuera decirle cuanto la amaba. -mira quién habla- su tono divertido me relaja un poco, me es más fácil resistirme si esta bromeando, pude sentir que me arrojaba algo no tuve que ser adivino cuando sentí la manzana impactar en mi cabeza. Puede haberla esquivado fácilmente, pero no lo hice ¿porque perderme ese pequeño momento de diversión? Contemplo el cielo y cierro los ojos tratando de llenar mis pulmones de aire fresco para hacerle frente. Inspiro hondo, lo más profundo que puedo hasta que mis pulmones duelen. Pero entonces siento sus delgados brazos rodeándome por la espalda y siento que el aire escapa de mis pulmones de golpe, es aquí donde soy consciente de que me tenso ante su solo contacto y estoy tentado a salir corriendo antes de que mis más bajos instintos tomen control de mi. -¿has estado muy pensativo?- la oigo atrás y trato de ocultar lo que su sola voz provoca en mi. -siempre hay cosas en las cuales pensar- le digo después de un momento de silencio. -siempre piensas demasiado, ese es tu problema- escucho su voz muy cerca de mi oído. Su abrazo me aprisionaba completamente, llenándome de su aroma, haciéndome dolorosamente consciente de su presencia tan cerca de mí. Mi corazón se disparo por los aires, tengo que resistir el impuso de pasar mi manos sobre las suyas en un acto que habia hecho miles de veces cuando me sumía en mis cavilaciones, pero ahora, ahí, Sentía que si tocaba alguna parte de su piel desnuda no podría controlarme, podría hacer algo que lo cual me arrepintiera o peor a un, dañarla a ella. Así que tomando más aire del que necesitaba y cerrando los ojos pude hablar. -solo me acorde de Mina eso es todo- le dije tratando de hacerlo sonar como añoranza. Si era sincero ya casi no me acordaba de ella, salvo por que fue la última mujer con la que me acosté, pensando en Gretel. Recordaba vagamente que era bonita, de piel blanca y cabellos naranjas como el atardecer ¡oh! Y claro que era una bruja blanca. El momento en concreto que recuerdo muy claro fue en aquel lago donde me curo, diciendo que el agua del estanque era curativa. Pero no pude perderme en esos recuerdos, porque sentí como los brazos de Gretel me soltaron. -oh- dijo ella. –lo siento, se que fue especial para ti- dijo tranquila, pero no tuve el valor de girarme todavía ¿Cómo podía encararla? ¿la había traicionado? ¿se podía traicionar a tu hermana? Era bastante obvio que no era la primera vez que me había acostado con una mujer, pero si hay un punto a mi favor jamás deje de pensar en ella, con todas y cada una era ella a la siempre le hacía el amor, era suya la piel de acariciaba con la mas infinita ternura y la que besaba con amor. En todas y cada una veía a Gretel porque jamás traicione a mi corazón. Mina no fue la excepción, era linda claro, pero no significo nada para mí, salvo que la vi morir y por un hecho del que todavía no estoy enterado del cómo pero Gretel se entero de nuestra pequeña aventura (casi puedo jurar que por Simon). Al que le dio un toque de inexistente romance que jamás sentí por ella. Pero en ese momento tuve que aferrarme a ese pensamiento antes de siquiera voltear a mirarla. El frio se instalo en mi cuerpo cuando sus brazos me abandonaron. -la vida continua Hansel- le escuche tranquila y consoladora. –No creo que le gustaría verte de esa manera- nuevamente tomo aire y me atrevo a mirarla. Y cuando por fin lo hago ella esta de espaldas a mí, mira el fuego quieta, como si fuera algo de extrema importancia. -solo me acorde- le digo después de un minuto de silencio. Todo mi cuerpo me pide que cruce las distancia y que la tome entre mis brazos, pero una pequeña vocecilla dentro de mi cabeza me indica que si me acerco a ella podría cometer una estupidez. -hace daños acordarse de algunas cosas- dice sin voltear al verme, sé que no puedo seguir así, mi actitud la lastima y eso lo sé, también sé que esto nos está distanciando y es lo último en lo que quiero pensar, pero ¿Qué puedo hacer? Un error en falso y puedo lastimarla. –Es mi turno, descansa- su frase me despeja y solo soy consciente de que se aleja de mi cuando ella pasa a mi lado. –voy al rio a lavarme un poco- dice sin mirarme, tal vez molesta por mi actitud y yo solo puedo decirme a mí mismo. -esto es por tu bien- pero soy consciente que ella no me escucha. Me obligo a mi mismo a permanecer en mi sitio en lugar de salir corriendo tras ella. – Es por tu bien- me vuelvo a repetir como si fuera una oración.

Title from 'Scars' by Papa Roach. Thank you to Aithine for beta duties. Warning: Here be implied, non-explicit incest. -o- Of the two of them, Hansel has always thought he's the more impatient. Yeah, Gretel can be hot-tempered, but her moves are usually a little more calculated, even when she's pissed. Hansel, on the other hand… Well, he knows his limitations, and they usually involve shooting things. Right now, however, it's Gretel who's shifting impatiently, irritation snapping in her fingers, tense along her spine. \"I'll be done when I'm done,\" he says, putting patience in his voice just to piss her off that little bit more. It's her own fault – you jump in front of an axe-wielding troll, you take your knocks. They've both learned that the hard way, but this is harder than usual. \"What's taking you so long?\" And there it is, the temper – hot and bright – rising in her voice. He stops what he's doing long enough to rest blood-grimed fingers on the back of her neck, feeling the tension starting to build in her again. \"I'll be done when I'm done,\" he repeats, and this time she sighs, the tension leaching back out of her. He let his fingers stroke over her skin as he pulls away, before turning his attention back to what he's doing. The calluses on his fingertips catch against the smoothness of the skin at the nape of her neck – she has as many scars as he does, but not there, not yet. After today, she'll have another scar to add to the tally. \"You're taking forever,\" she gripes, but there's no heat in it, not this time. Instead, he hears the echo of every whine she's ever given voice to in her words, every petulant moment, every unreasonable little temper tantrum. Not that there have been many of those since their parents died. He swallows down the smile that wants to rise to the surface – she wouldn't hesitate to wipe it off his face again, and, really, he's just saving her the effort. Instead, he focuses on the small, neat line of stitches he's etching into the skin of her shoulder. His needlework has always been better than hers. Gretel sighs, but stays still for him, barely wincing as the needle slides into her flesh. \"You don't have to be so fussy,\" she says. \"It's not like anyone will see it.\" \"I will.\" He pauses for a moment then leans down to press a kiss to her neck, just below the small, dark curls at the edge of her hairline. He flicks out his tongue and tastes salt and sweat and iron. He tastes Gretel. When he straightens up again, she sways towards him, just fractionally, the way she always follows that pull towards him and he follows the same pull back towards her. \"Just try a little patience,\" he chides, letting the smile show in his voice. \"You never know, you might get a taste for it.\" She snorts, and this time he let his fingers stroke down over her spine. \"Are you sewing me up, or trying to get me to lie down and spread my legs for you? Because I feel I should point out the fact that I have a fucking axe wound in my shoulder.\" \"Yeah, like it'll be the first time you've been on top.\" Her laugh turns into a gasp as he pushes the needle through her flesh again, but she bites it back, like she always bites it back, even around him. It doesn't mean he doesn't see it anyway. \"Won't be long,\" he soothes, and Gretel turns her head to glare at him. This time he lets the smile show; she can't smack him around the head from this angle. Gretel realises that at the same time he does, and lets out a slightly disgruntled sound as she faces front again; when she turns away, all he can see is the sleek, silky curve of her spine, and the ugly row of black crosses against the red line that had split her shoulder open. His stitches will never be neat enough, not for his Gretel's skin, which might be sun-darkened and wind-roughened, but is still beautiful to him. But they'll do what they've always done – make do with what they have. He makes the last stitch, as small and neat as the others, and ties it off, cutting the thread close to the skin so it won't catch when she pulls her shirt back on. And then – task done – he lets his fingers rest at the top of her spine again. This won't be the last scar Gretel bears. There are others already, older ones carved into her flesh: the nick where her shoulder joins her neck, left when a thrown knife missed its mark but marked his Gretel anyway; the shiny, smooth oval of a burn on her shoulder blade, where a hot coal had landed right before they burnt that bitch's shack to the ground; the crescent shape over her hip from the claws of a swamp witch. He traces them all with reverent fingers, pressing his lips against those he can reach. When he finally pauses, his hand is curled around her hip and his face is buried in her hair. \"Do me a favour and learn how to duck?\" he murmurs, rubbing the stubble from a three-day beard against her neck just to feel her twitch. \"Embroidery's always bored me.\" This time she twists sinuously in his grasp and smacks her hand against his temple. Hard. \"Smart ass,\" she grumbles, but again there's no heat in it, not until he runs his hand along her arm, fingers wrapping lightly around her wrist and his thumb stroking over her pulse point. \"It was close,\" he says, always one to point out the obvious, a habit she's complained about more than once. \"I'm fine.\" There's warmth in Gretel's eyes now, the heat banked behind them, but, as always, ready to leap back into flame. \"You worry too much.\" \"And you don't worry enough.\" She smiles at him, and it's soft and tender, all the things that Gretel isn't. He must be freaking the fuck out if that's the way she's looking at him. He doesn't know how to stop. Her hand cups his face, her thumb now stroking a line along his cheek, above where his beard is starting to grow thickly. It itches and he'll shave it off soon, leave it just long enough, just rough enough to add to her pleasure when his face is buried between her thighs. \"I'm fine,\" she repeats, and her smile grows dark and dirty, more familiar, quieting the rapid beating of his heart. \"Want me to prove it to you?\" He sighs and turns his head, pressing a kiss against the dry, callused skin of her palm and breathing in the scent of her. His Gretel, made of equal parts gunpowder and grim determination. He knows how this will go – wounded or not, she'll have her way. She already has him. \"Hansel?\" she prompts, her eyes already softening again, so much in them behind the leather and attitude, and he's the only one who gets to see it. Like he's the only one who sees her scars. \"Yeah,\" he says, putting a challenging note in his voice just to bring that smile back to her face, the one that's hungry, not pained. \"I want you to prove it. \"But only if you're on top.\" The end ","Summary":" Author's Notes: For Nerissa for Yuletide 2015.

My legs wouldn't move, no matter how much I wanted them to. I stood there, in front of the blazing oven, listening to that witch's wretched screams for what seemed like forever. The heat licked at my arms and my face; I was absolutely paralyzed by it. Strange muffled voices were sounding around me, or was it one? I couldn't tell. I could hear my heart thumping loudly and my eyes, unblinking, started to sting from the ash. Finally, after an eternity of being a statue, I could hear my brother calling out my name. \"Gretel! Gretel?! Gretel, come free me!\" I could blink my eyes and no more were the screams prominent in my ears. Suddenly blood flowed through my legs and I ran to my poor brother… \"HANSEL!\" I screamed out, awaking from a terrible nightmare. Looking around, I realized I had wandered to the kitchen in my unconscious state. I wasn't entirely surprised I had found my way out of my bed; \"Slumber Journeying\" the doctor had called it. Ever since that eventful day, my brother and I were never the same. Everyone in the main village said the witch put one last curse on my brother and me with her terrible screams, so we'd never get away with killing her. Some nights I have no choice but to believe them. Feeling the hot tears and cold sweat on my nightgown collar, I slowly sat up off the stone floor. Hoping my father hadn't heard me waken, I tip toed in the low light of the early morn to my brother's room. I winced as the door creaked loudly. Inside, there were things all over the floor: clothes, candlesticks, and thick wooden planks. Hansel was snoring loudly in his bed, a trail of thick drool coming from the corner of his mouth. I stepped over his things to sit at the foot of his bed. Gently shaking his uncovered foot, I attempted to wake him up. Papa would be up soon and Hansel would throw a mighty fit if he hadn't gotten up and lifted his logs before then. The cage bars closed in on me from all sides. Smoke rose with the heat from the fire and I couldn't see my sister anymore. Having no idea if she was alive or dead, I held my breath and squeezed my eyes shut for seconds, then minutes. Time crawled slowly and I started to go insane from the tiny space and my temporary blindness. My bulging stomach felt like I had eaten balloons. My skin was stretched and hurt so terribly bad that I crossed my arms over my abdomen and clutched at my sides. Tears flowed from my clenched eyes and down my inflated cheeks. I opened them, unable to wait any longer. Shaking, I surveyed the room to see the smoke had cleared and I saw my sister staring at the oven. I called for her again, and again until she finally heard my voice. When Gretel ran to me, I puked out a load of pancakes from the sudden anticipation of escaping this horrid prison… I felt a hand gripping my foot and shaking it. The unexpected contact startled me and I instinctively kicked hard toward the mass at the edge of my bed. \"You roach brain!\" a female voice said to me. It took me a few seconds in my grogginess to recognize the voice as my sister's, she continued to speak. \"It doesn't seem Papa is awake yet. Hansel, you've slept in too long, it is daylight.\" I sat up slowly and stared at her, the words not yet sinking in. Her bright orange curls were knotted and stuck to her neck and forehead; she must have had a nightmare as well. After a few more minutes of blurred sight and hazy thoughts, my eyes widened and I jumped out of bed. \"Gretel! Why hadn't you woken me sooner?!\" I yelled at her, rushing to get dressed and get in my morning exercise. She yelled right back at me, \"It's not my responsibility to wake you, Hansel! You better hope all of your noise hasn't startled Papa.\" Gretel ended her sentence on a softer note and left the room. In Gretel's absence, I quickly changed from my slumber attire to my scuffed work clothes. I could feel my fuming face was nearly as red as my knotted curls. All morning I tried to forgive Gretel for letting me sleep through my workout time. Guzzling down two glasses of milk and five hot eggs, I contemplated on apologizing for yelling at her. Although, I still thought about how she hadn't woken me. After my breakfast I still had to wait for Papa to get ready for work. I searched around the house for Gretel, I had decided I wanted to apologize for my cruel behavior earlier. Curled up on the couch with her hair covering her body is how I found her. She heard me approach before I wanted her to, so I didn't have enough time to plan out my side of the conversation. \"Come to scream at me some more, dear brother?\" She asked me with hot venom spitting off her tongue. \"Gretel, I do not want to fight. I know I was wrong. You needn't slip your tongue to me…\" She looked at me with narrow eyes. Surveying my words as if they were tangible objects she could inspect every inch of. After a few silent seconds Gretel finally straightened up and relaxed, a wordless invitation for me to sit. Without any more on the subject, I walked over to her and sat. She stared at me with worry in her bright emerald eyes. \"You know, Hansel… I believe all of this pushing and over-working is making you so irritable…if you'd just –\"\"NO, SISTER! I WILL NOT!\" That did it. How dare she suggest I stop working?! How dare this mindless fool of a girl give ME advice?! I looked at her with fire in my eyes and she looked back with pure fear. My patience had snapped. I heard the door to Papa's room open then close and I was storming out the house in a flash. With nothing but my anger and my adrenaline fueling me, I fumed on into the forest. The path Papa and I always took was clear enough so I took it; Papa would catch up eventually. My thoughts were jumbled at best and my vision tinted red. Why would my sister, of all people in this world, suggest I stop building? She understands more than anyone why I need to be healthy. I honestly hadn't meant to make Hansel angry. I've been worried about him lately. Every day I see him wake earlier than the sun to push himself until he's screaming and crying from the burn… I can't take it anymore; my poor brother is going to die from this disease. Even though it hurts me though, I do understand why he's doing this, it's for the same reason I refuse to step near any type of stove or fire. Papa walked up to me with a worried look on his face. \"Oh, Papa, if you don't stop worrying, your face is going to be scrunched like Madame Radley's challenged old dog.\" He smiled at that. Madame Radley puts the welfare of that old mutt before her own work at the bakery. I've told her myself that thing looks like it ran face-first into a pan, I did. \"Grets, you don't think I'd look good as an old flat-face?\" \"No, Papa!\" We both laughed and then the laughter faded away into seriousness. \"Gretel, why must you fight with your brother so much?\" He looked at me with sad old eyes, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all that our troubles have put him through. \"I don't, Father. It's just… just… I'm so worried he'll die!\" My voice cracked on that last dreadful word and I couldn't hold back the flooding in my eyes. Papa came over and held me for a while–I lost track of time–until I stopped crying. When the tears finally subsided, he leaned back, wiped my face clean and stood up. \"I'll see you later, Grets. Don't get yourself into trouble, understand?\" I nodded silently and smiled at him. \"Good day at work, Father.\" After Papa left, I had nothing to do–just like any other day. There was no way I was going to cook any food that wasn't already cooked, so I shuffled lightly into the kitchen, sticking myself to the wall furthest from the stove and nearest to the icebox. I heaved it open and inside I found a small package wrapped up in cloth. Curiosity overtook my manners as I plucked it out of the icebox and set it on the counter. Not sure if this was just some stupid prank that Hansel had pulled, I left the icebox open in case I needed to fling this object back into it. \" Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.\" Our stepmother said to my sister and me with her dry voice. We both knew that's not what she'd wanted to tell us. Gretel and I shared a glance then looked back at her before we nodded and watched her waddle away. \"Come on Grets… We should find a log to drag over here so we can sit on it.\" That poor girl was already starting to tear up but she nodded and looked around for a good direction to head toward. I looked around as well and already the sun was moving steadily above us. \"Gretel, this way?\" I looked back at her and she was gone. I called out her name and listened for her but I could hear nothing. My stomach started to grumble and my eyes started to water. Not knowing what to do, I just sat down, scratching into the tree next to me every time I counted to one-hundred. After twenty-four scratches, I finally heard rustling in the bushes –along with huffing and groaning. I jumped up and ran to the noise to find my sister, red in the face, pushing and shoving on a rather large log. A tap on my shoulder made me shout out and jump. I turned around, expecting my dry-mouthed stepmother, only to find Papa standing behind me with deep worry lines in his face. After a long while of stomping through the woods, I'd stumbled across mine and Gretel's first night camp. Still out of it, I turned back around to see twenty-four jagged lines etched into a tree. \"Did you sit down to wait for your old father?\" Papa chuckled, although looked at me with the same lines on his face. I shook my head to clear out the old memories and boomed at him with laughter. \"You old toad! I got tired just from waiting for your creaky legs to catch up!\" He smiled and relaxed a bit, then so did I. Papa always knew how to cheer me up, and I always knew how to make him worry just a bit less. We probably wouldn't be able to live without one another. Setting off into the woods, off the path, Papa and I carried our lumbering tools. After a rather short while, Papa needed me to carry his tools as well. \"Oh just cricked my neck last night, Son, it is alright.\" he'd said, I didn't believe him. We trudged along through weeds, bushes, and thorns to find the perfect size tree. We looked at each other, then looked at the magnificent trunk and marveled for a moment before getting to work. About a quarter of the way through, Papa realized he had forgotten the landing ribbon. [A landing ribbon is a wide strip of cloth with handles at each side that we lay down on the ground for the tree to land on; it makes it much easier to carry the thing home.] I stepped back from the oversized dandelion and looked at it, sizing it up, and then looking at myself. Shrugging, I shouted up at my father, \"I think I could just catch it! It doesn't seem too big! I just figure we would do it in sections?!\" Papa looked down at me, contemplating for a moment, then shrugged and shouted back, \"You've done it with smaller trees before, I don't see why not!\" Nodding, I stood into place as he chopped away at the top. I heard the creak before I saw the top of the tree falling toward me. I'm not sure what had happened in the last few minutes, maybe spacing out? I looked up just in time to notice a huge branch jutting out and pointing right at my chest. With barely any time to move, I tried sidestepping to get out of the way but I miscalculated… I felt a sharp pain and everything went black. When Papa came home, I was not expecting him to be carrying a body. I had screamed and cried after my legs failed to keep me up. My brother… I knew his eyes were too big for his muscles, he was just too obsessed to realize it. His face was the most unbearable part; it looked like that old dog. For hours I have been rocking in my bed. My brother is everything to me and I never had a chance to make amends. He had taken the time to make me breakfast this morning and put it in the icebox for me. All I did was make him believe I didn't understand him… After what seemed like an eternity, my wet, stinging eyes finally drooped shut. I lied there with my eyes closed for a while before actually drifted into unconsciousness. Images came into focus and I wasn't in bed anymore… Hansel and I were walking for the forest for quite a long time before we started to smell wonderful scents. We looked at each other, his eyes were gleaming and I'm sure mine were too. For some reason, I'm not sure why, I felt a twinge of sadness wash over me as I looked at him. \"Come on Gretel! There must be someone living out here!\" He shouted and started running. I ran after him, my stomach growled loudly in protest but I decided to keep running anyway. I figured it would be worth it when we found that mouthwatering smell. My brother and I broke through a wall of bushes and thorns to stumble upon a glorious, no, magnificent… no, stupendous gingerbread house. It had sugar windows and a gumdrop pathway. The lawn smelled of lemon water and the fence looked like peanut brittle. Hansel looked back at me with happiness filling his eyes and pointed to the window, \"We will set to work on that, and have a good meal.\" My stomach growled loudly at the word. \"I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.\" We nodded to each other and ran at the house, I popped the window out of its place in the wall and took a bite of it. I expected it to taste sweet and start dissolving in my mouth, instead I tasted blood. My tongue burned and screamed in pain and my stomach felt like knives… \"PAPA! HELP!\" I screamed as loud as my blood filled mouth would let me. It was so much that I was gargling and choking on it. My father immediately ran outside to find me doubled over in the grass with the window it shards all around me. It didn't take him long to realize I was \"Slumber Journeying\" again and acted out my dream. He held me close and didn't let me look away from his eyes for a moment. Papa's hot tears fell on my face, my neck, my hair… \"I… I'm so s-sorry t-t-the trouble I-I've… caused you Pa-\". My stomach burned and my insides felt like small animals were biting at my organs to be free. \"Shh, Daughter… don't speak.\" His voice comforted me in those last moments. I felt so cold… What I would have given to be next to a fire one last time. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes, my body suddenly felt weightless and everything faded away. Deep in the sorrowful forest, next to a blazing fire to keep warm, a blind woman grinned. ","Summary":" The room was so thick with smoke and screams.

She did not know where she was walking, nor did she care. She just let her mind wander as her feet seemed to carry her in the direction they chose. A sudden shadow blocked out the view of the sun, though it quickly returned, before disappearing again. It reminded Gretal of a strobe light. When she looked up, she saw it was only a tree, barren of its leaves from the cold air and approaching winter. Its branches flickered across the sun, toying with the light. Looking around, the teenager realized it was not one tree, but hundreds, maybe thousands of trees, standing as still as statues, towering over her. She took a step forward, inching towards the path that made a small gap between the crowded sugar maples. The crispy red and orange leaves crunched and crackled under Gretal's boots as she walked past the first few trees. She had just reached a fork in the road when she heard a soft *clink* against her boot. She glanced down to see nothing but dry dirt and autumn leaves, broken from her footfall. But when she looked closer, she saw that there was something small and metallic that lay among the broken bits; a key. It was an old fashioned, bronze key with a round handle and simple carving at the end. She picked it up, smiled at the odd object, and turned left, following the path. After many minutes, maybe even an hour, Gretal reached a river. It ran long and narrow, with shallow, crystal clear water. Scattered in the water were large rocks, breaking the surface of the river, shining with a bright, watery sheen. Though that was not all that shone. Wedged between two large rocks was a gleaming, golden chalice. Gretal bent down and plucked the cup from between the two rocks, then emptied the clear, cool liquid from inside. It had a ring of red stones around the cup, and a very detailed stem. It looked expensive… Gretal looked around to see if anyone would claim the cup, but she was alone. She held the chalice in her hand, and was prepared to hop across some of the higher stones to cross the river, when something seemed to streak across her line of vision. She looked up, and at first saw nothing. Then she met the eyes of a small, motionless orange fox with a fluffy brown tail. No wonder she hadn't seen it at first! Its brightly coloured fur blended almost perfectly with the fallen autumn leaves. A sudden urge to touch the animal's soft looking fur came over her, as she took a step on the nearest rock to make her way across the stream. But she misplaced her foot, and slipped into icy water, startling the fox. Gretal had just looked up to see the fox's dark tail far in the distance. Red streaked the knee of the girl's jeans and she could taste the foul bitterness of blood in her mouth. Gretal stood up, soaked in freezing water, and fell immediately back down again, pulled by the surprisingly strong current. Gretal stood again, this time keeping her balance, and began to cross the river, cup clutched to her chest. Trying to concentrate on placing one foot in front of the other did not prepare Gretal for when a sudden rush of breath left her lungs as she fell back on a flat rock beneath the water. Sitting up immediately, Gretal struggled to breath, coughing up whatever water she had inhaled. She stood up still gasping, and fell forward, clawing at the dry land, trying to pull herself out of the hungry river. When she was finally kneeling safely on the dirt, her coat hanging heavy on her back, she slid the golden chalice into her pocket, hearing metal clink on metal as it connected with where the key rested. Gretal stood up and began to walk in a direction seemingly chosen at random. After what seemed like hours, the girl stopped. She felt a sudden burst of warmth on her face, a great contrast to the cold autumn night air against her damp clothes. A small cottage stood in the distance, partially hidden by the trees. Light spread out in the darkness from round windows and the lantern that hung by the front door. She approached the door, moving steadily towards the light like a moth to a flame. The smell of burned matches seemed to surround the small house. The girl reached for the door handle but only received an unsatisfying clicking noise; locked. She quickly ran her hands along the top of the door frame for a key that might be hidden. Wait… a key! The girl reached into her pocket, searching for a small bronze object, manoeuvring around the golden cup, with no luck. Impatiently, she pulled the chalice from her pocket and found the key sitting within the cup. The girl smile as she stuck the key into the small hole below the bronze handle and turned it, hearing a satisfying *click*. The door swung open in front of her, revealing a dim, barren hallway. The only source of light she could see came from the small fixtures on the wall and the lantern that hung by the door. The hall had several doorways and ended in what looked like a kitchen. The girl gripped the chalice tightly and turned to the first door on the left. The small room was completely empty. The beige walls were totally bare, except for the large, rectangular window on the far back wall. The girl crossed the room in two long strides. She gazed out the window where, beyond the glass stood a small cheerful garden. The moonlit fountain seemed to sparkle, attracting small butterflies with silver wings. \"And what, may I ask, are you doing in my house, young lady?\" The heavily accented voice echoed slightly from behind her. The girl spun around to see a stout old woman hunched over a crooked wooden cane. Her gray hair hung down on her wrinkly, gruesome face. \"I'm sorry, I was just-\" The girl glanced back at the window to see the drastic change in scenery. The trees and earth of the garden had turned black, bleeding darkness. Whatever beautiful life had been portrayed in the scene had been consumed by shadow. Gretal was shocked, turning her head slowly to look at the old woman in front of her. She swallowed bile, and finished her sentence; \"I'm sorry, I was just leaving,\" the girl said. She ran for the door, only to find it closed, though she did not hear it shut. The woman smiled hungrily, staring at the girl as though wondering how many bites it would take to consume her completely. \"No need to be rushin' out so quickly, little one. Why not stay for a bit?\" \"Oh, no thank you. It's getting quite late.\" The woman's eyes narrowed on the chalice in the girl's hand, gripping it so tightly that her knuckles turned her pale skin a startling white. The girl took a step back and held the golden cup close to her chest. \"That's my cup!\" The girl pressed her back to the cold stone wall, watching as the old woman's face changed in the light, her eyes black orbs radiating darkness, like the trees outside the window. \"Give it to me!\" The girl stared in horror. \"What are you?\" was all she could muster as her knees gave out and she fell to the floor, though she still held the cup firmly. The old woman let out a cry of frustration and she lifted her arms, fingers spread wide, as bright and startling lightning shot out from her palms, lighting the room with an eerie glow that shadowed the hag's face, making her seem only more gruesome. \"Foolish human. Do you not know better than do defy a witch?\" Her teeth began to sharpen, becoming more canine-like than human. \"Such disrespect among mortals these days.\" The witch's mouth opened wide; wider than it should have been able too, as though she were unhinging her jaw like a snake. She was pure darkness and evil. \"I'd give you another chance to give me the cup,\" she said in a voice a raspy croak, \"but you see, I am quite hungry, and I haven't had a good meal in years!\" The disturbingly mutated old woman lunged at her, and the girl cried out in terror, letting out screams that no one could hear. So let me know what you guys thing And be honest ;) Aye ","Summary":" It was mid-October, the air not yet to cold, but the wind made Gretal wrap her coat more tightly ar"},{"Movie":"Hansel & Gretel","Title":"The Reason Why","Author":"Tyloric","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11537138","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Note: Originally posted on Archive of Our Own. I've decided to start porting over some of my more popular stories. Here's the thing; Hansel likes kids, he really does. Kids are the best. Their love is uncensored, they have no trouble calling attention any elephants in the room that adults pointedly ignore, it's painfully obvious when they lie, and the best part is when they laugh or smile. One thing he could do without, however, is the tears. The blond girl he was cradling in his arms could be no more than nine years old and was cold, terrified, and utterly miserable. She had been taken by a witch who lurked in a swamp just as the sun had begun to set the previous evening. God only knows what the witch had had planned for her, but it didn't matter now; the bitch didn't have a head anymore. Or arms, for that matter. Hansel had stripped her of everything but her undergarments-the girls clothes had been soaked and in tatters-and wrapped her in the blanket he kept in his pack. She whimpered against his chest weakly. \"Don't worry kid, I got you. You're safe,\" he tried to soothe her. Problem was, as much as he liked kids, he'd never been particularly talented at actually communicating with them. \"I want my mommy,\" she said through a sob. \"Yeah, I get that. You're name's, Amelia, right?\" At her nod, Hansel continued, \"Your parents told us, my sister and I, to come and bring you home. So, that's what I'm gonna do, okay?\" Instead of responding she just sobs quietly, burying her face in his shirt. \"Hansel!\" Gretel called as she ran up to him, covered in dirt and slime, carrying her crossbow. \"Hey,\" he greeted. \"You check? She's dead dead, right?\" \"Yeah, we're good,\" she confirmed. \"But next time you're the one who goes in the water.\" He grinned slyly. \"You did very well. I am so proud.\" \"Shut up,\" she scorns, before glancing at the bundle in his arms. \"Is she alright?\" \"Yeah, I think so. She needs to get warm, though. She's wet and her clothes were a lost cause. She'll catch a chill out here.\" \"Right,\" Gretel said, nodding her agreement. She helped him slip his and her satchels on his shoulder so he wouldn't have to put Amelia down. Slinging Hansel's gun across her back, she motions for him to move. \"We can get back before nightfall if we hurry.\" The journey through the forest was long, Hansel's pace slowed by both the girl and their supplies, but he didn't complain. He took careful steps to try and keep his jostling around to a minimum, Gretel following behind him, keeping speed. It was a nice comfort, knowing she always had his back, especially in instances like now when he's too distracted to watch it himself. A long while after they had started walking, Amelia murmurs something that Hansel can't quite make out. \"What?\" He clipped out sharply before remembering that his generally sarcastic nature was not at all helpful. \"I can't hear you, Amy,\" he said, keeping his tone as gentle as he was able. \"What's your name?\" She asked so softly that Hansel almost missed it again. \"I'm Hansel,\" he stammered clumsily, unprepared for the question. \"The ugly one is my sister, Gretel.\" He didn't need to look to feel the glare she was giving him; the scent of his leather coat burning was evidence enough. \"It's nice to meet you, Amelia,\" Gretel said over Hansel's shoulder even though the girl isn't actually looking at either of them. It's when Amelia shifts in his arms that Hansel realizes the way he'd been carrying her couldn't be comfortable. He adjusted his stance so that he's leaning more to the side, hefting her up so that one arm is under her knees and the other his supporting the small of her back, resting her head on his shoulder. \"That better?\" He asks and she nods without opening her eyes. The rest of the walk back was utterly silent, the only sounds to be heard being the leaves and branches underneath their boots and Amelia breathing softly in his ear. They delivered the girl to her parents just as the sun touches the horizon. Hansel, feeling the exhaustion in his bones, goes through the motions of all the thanks and payment mechanically. The two siblings reached their room at the inn in a zombie like state. Hansel, beyond caring, stripped off his pants and folded up his coat to use as a pillow, plopped down on the floor and promptly passed out. Hansel was just waking when someone knocks on the door. Growling in frustration, he rolls to his feet and stomps over and throws it open, his anger immediately fizzling out when he sees who's standing there. Amelia's father was standing a bit stiffly, looking nervous, his daughter peeking around his legs. \"Uh,\" Hansel starts dumbly, at a complete loss for what the man's name actually was-that was always Gretel's thing, he wasn't a people person. \"Hello, sir,\" he greeted instead. The man doesn't reply, but rather says somewhat impatiently, \"Come on then, Girlie. Say what'cha wanted ta say.\" Ameilia slid around so that she was standing in front of Hansel, her head bowed down. \"Hi,\" she said shyly. She looked completely different than she had the previous day. Her face was full of color, her blond hair was clean and brushed, wearing a pale green dress. It was kind of unfair how quickly children bounced back, though it did ease his mind a bit to see that the girl hadn't been in as bad a shape as he'd originally thought. Kneeling so that he's at eye level with her, Hansel asks, \"Hey there, kid. Feeling better?\" She nods and just stands there, holding her hands behind her back. \"Thank you for saving me, Hansel,\" she says after the silence had stretched on for a few seconds. Hansel huffs, laughing, \"Wasn't any trouble. It's kind of what I do.\" Amy looked him in the eye before pushing something into his hands; a flower, small and yellow with smooth, round petals. She then rushed forward and threw her arms around his neck. He was so stunned that he didn't have time to respond before she pulled away and ran down the stairs without a word, her father running after her with a panicked tone. He stays there for a moment, kneeling in the doorway, his mind trying to process what had just occurred. Eventually a smile spread across his face, big and happy and not at all in his usual character. Hansel had kept the flower tucked behind his ear, wearing it proudly as a badge of honor, right up until it was so dry and shriveled that it fell apart in his hand. And the one time a witch had the audacity to mock him for wearing it? He stabbed her in the eye. So, long story short; Hansel loves kids, and will royally fuck up anyone who even thinks about hurting one. ","Summary":" Note: Originally posted on Archive of Our Own.

We must feed ourselves and cannot feed more.\" The husband looking unsettled looked at his wife with an unbelieving look, saw his wife was serious and consented uneasily. \"How shall we rid of them?\" The husband sat in a nearby chair looking uncomfortable. \"You shall bring them to the woods tomorrow morning to fetch some firewood and tell them to sit and wait for you, but you shall not return.\" \"Be quiet Gretel! They'll hear us!\" Whispered Hansel to his sister, looking quite annoyed. \"I'm sorry! I feel really nervous.

The snow was crisp as the guests arrived. Their shoes were wet, and still, they walked onto the carpet of the McMichael's house. As soon as they entered, they were transported into a world of merriment. John and Diana always created a wonderful environment for family and friends. Their wealth added onto what they built up, the doctor bragging that his parties got better each year. While family and friends mingled, the children spent their time in the library. The younger ones listed off what toy they hoped to get, the older ones discussing what they thought was far more important. Magdalena was in another world. She read, her hazel eyes looking from page to page. Her hands gently flipping and mind wide open. It was the same book she had been obsessed with for years. Crimson Peak by Edith Cushing. The cover was torn and the pages were worn out, but the only thing that mattered was the adventure inside. And the personal message from the author herself. \"Madge,\" it was written,\" you are a wonderful young lady. May you dream big and believe in all. With love, Grandma.\" The girl finished the book again, but not before glaring at her cousin. Daniel smiled evily, his intentions harmful. For the last sixteen years, he tormented and teased the young lady. He was her least favorite cousin from her favorite aunt. \"Reading the same book again?\" he asked. \"What's wrong with that?\" the girl shrugged as she made her way to the shelves. \"It gets boring,\" he sighed,\" just because Grandma wrote it doesn't force you to read it.\" \"Who said I was being forced to?\" \"My mom.\" Madge knew that was a lie. Aunt Bathsheba knew how much she loved that book. She climbed to the third shelf and placed it back in the slot. As she made her way back down, blonde hair bouncing, she noticed that Daniel was gone. He was talking to Rosa Beth, the only daughter of Aunt Lily. The young teen had asked the boy about Crimson Peak, to which he scoffed. \"It's a fake ghost story,\" he laughed,\" We're only forced to read it because Grandma made it up.\" \"She didn't make any of it up,\" Madge mumbled. \"Can you prove that?\" he asked,\" Just because you're sixteen and still believe in fake stories doesn't mean everyone else has to. I bet if I asked Grandma, she'd-\" A woman poked her head in the doorway. It was a sweet, old, recognizable face that Madge was relieved to see. Edith announced to her grandchildren that dinner was ready. Madge's brothers ran with her other boy cousins, except for Alan, who was 'too mature for playing around' but not enough to talk to the adults. She was the last to leave the library, where the kind smile greeted her. \"Hello, Grandma,\" Madge smiled as they walked down the hallway. \"I've been looking for you all night, Magdalena,\" the old woman laughed,\" I tried to ask your father, but he's in his own world.\" \"Talking to his colleagues?\" \"You guessed it.\" John McMichael was a good natured man, the two found. He made sure his family had food on the table, a roof over their heads, and a Christmas party every year. However, he could be cocky when he wanted to. It was much unlike his father, who always stayed humble about his profession. Edith, her old eyes upon her eldest granddaughter, saw that something bothered her. She knew what it was. \"Who said something?\" \"Daniel,\" the girl sighed as they got to the end of the hallway,\" but who else would it be? Grandma, this sounds weird, but I know those stories are real. No matter what they say, I just know it-\" \"They are,\" Edith said as they shuffled into the dining room,\" I may be old, but I know ghosts and insane things when I see it. Believe me, if it were safe enough, I'd take you to Allerdale to show you.\" \"I'd have to decline,\" the girl laughed. The older woman did too. She moved in between her daughters and sat down. Magdalena sat near the end of the table, where her mother sat. Diana gave a small smile to her daughter, then looked over as her husband stood up. The dark haired doctor, his glass in hand, glanced around. He was admiring the people that sat before him. Each one had their glasses in the air. The dinner's steam filled the air, looking delicious and as beautiful as last year's. This made the arrogant man smile. \"I raise a glass,\" he pointed out,\" to a toast. A toast to Diana and I for hosting another successful party. For our chefs, my wife and my sisters, Bathsheba and Lily, who cooked a wonderful dinner- we can hope. A toast to my mother, who sits with us, and my father, who sadly passed away in '45. God rest his soul.\" Murmurs were heard amongst the group. Some silently prayed, but John continued his toast. \"They've shaped me into the man I am today,\" he said,\" and to my children, who will become fine people, and for you, I have news. Due to my new job, yes, a new job, we will be moving,\" seeing the expression of the people, John rushed on,\" We won't be moving just anywhere. I couldn't wait to tell you this- but we'll be moving to England.\" Diana's praises were louder than the chatter. John found her happiness to be above the words of the others. Edith seemed tense, but let her son continue without a word. \"There is an old mansion in need of some work,\" he explained,\" I've bought it for a very good price. Once it's done up, we'll enjoy it! Trust me. With that being said, may we have a happy Christmas and may 1950 bring us joy!\" The group toasted, all except for John's wife, his children, and Edith. The old woman looked to her granddaughter. It was obvious that something new took up her mind. \"Dad,\" the girl choked out,\" What was the name of the mansion?\" \"Allerdale Hall,\" he looked straight at his mother,\" I believe it's in a red clay mine. Nothing we can't fix.\" \"Why would you buy that property when you know what occurred there?\" After the guests left, his sisters and Diana wanted to have a talk with John. He didn't want to hear it from his sister. \"I thought,\" he laughed,\" as the oldest, you knew better. None of that is real, Bathsheba. It's a fake.\" \"It was real for mom,\" she scolded,\" You know that mansion is a disaster. It's broken, it's messy- hell, it's sinking on a clay farm!\" \"It's certainly no place to raise a family,\" Diana stepped in. \"But the beauty is that we're gonna rebuild it,\" he explained,\" once the winter's over, we take down the entire mansion! We'll rebuild the foundation, we'll restore it to its full glory. We can have a fantastic new life! Just because Mom says it's evil and haunted doesn't mean it's true. We're moving whether any of you like it or not.\" Edith stood outside the door, unable to process the news. She couldn't believe her own son was going back to the mansion of bad memories. Especially with her grandchildren. The worry settled on her own face, as well as her eldest granddaughter. \"He doesn't believe all the things that happened,\" Magdalena said,\" he doesn't get it- we can't move into that house.\" \"I know, dear,\" Edith lifted her head,\" but those spirits couldn't hurt you. They've moved on and won't disturb you. And if they're still around- well, it'll be alright. I'm moving with you.\" \"Are you sure you wanna go back, Grandma?\" the girl asked. Edith nodded and earned a smile from Madge. The old woman hated the idea of her family living in a house of horrors. The young girl watched as Edith knocked on the door and went into the room. Magdalena had more confidence if her grandmother was going. She knew what happened at Allerdale Hall. She'd been poisoned and trick by siblings with a secret. She knew what happened when it was Crimson Peak. I'm back to writing fanfiction! I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll be back.[Chapter 2] Welcome back, everyone! I hope you guys enjoy this chapter. The family barely celebrated the new decade before John packed everything he could and they were off. Madge clung to her book throughout the entire journey. She was nervous for the road that they were on. She knew how dangerous their new life on Allerdale Hall would be. The evidence was right in her arms. Edith looked around. The town outside of their home wasn't lively- it never was. Much had changed, however, as it wasn't abandoned. There were buildings all around, and few people walked on the streets. The car in front of them, John and Diana, suddenly stopped, to allow a family to walk past. The children, Edith, and the driver (Mr Wills- who would help John fix up the house) fell forward. The man that drove reminded Edith of a man she knew long ago. He was kindly and made sure the ride was as smooth as possible. \"You'll see folks from time to time,\" the driver gave a toothy grin,\" A lot of rich folk come here in the summer to be away from the city. Problem is- they bring all the pretentious people with 'em.\" \"When I lived here,\" Edith recalled as the cars started up again.\" it was pretty abandoned. I'm surprise so much has changed.\" \"Well,\" Mr Wills turned as the McMichael's did,\" the mansion won't be changin' until your son fixes it up.\" Magdalena watched the outside world. The snow made the people outside look like ghosts. Their movement against the winter winds were slow, and each look was lamented and in a distant place. Some scowled, as if they knew the family's purpose for being in England. She felt ashamed of what they were doing and where they were going. As they left the town, the girl looked down at her book. The mansion, by car, was only a short distance away. Edith felt the bitter cold on her feet, reminded of the long walk she took. If it wasn't for Alan, she would have died in that mansion. Her words would never be published. The family she had now would've been wishful thinking as she choked on blood and poison. \"If your grandfather found out we were going here,\" she said to the children as they rode on,\" he would've never forgiven your father.\" Madge lifted her head once the car jerked again. The land was covered in red and white, clay seeped from the ground. For how sinister it truly was, she saw the beauty in the land. Her eyes darted across , the book loosely hung in her arms. George, who sat in the middle, scrambled over his brother. He wanted a glimpse of the outside. \"I've never seen this much red!\" Edward commented. \"It's amazing,\" Madge mumbled. \"It's weird,\" George looked around,\" What kind of place is this?\" \"Not one for children,\" Edith told herself. Once the car stopped, the boys ran out onto the clay. Diana walked over and scolded her sons. She watched as the clay stained their shoes and pants. Stains she wouldn't be able to get out. Mr. Wills and John grabbed the bags, lost in chatter. The cold was out of their minds as they dragged the trunks to the steps of the house. Edith and Madge awaited the open door. The old woman shivered as her son pulled out the massive ring of keys, each one serving a different purpose in the home. \"Are you ready?\" the young girl asked. \"I will warn you now and tell your brothers later,\" Edith took a deep breath,\" Do not go into the basement.\" \"That's the worst part of the house,\" Madge looked at the leather bound book. \"Well,\" John walked in,\" it's home.\" The girl headed inside, without a spark of hesitation. The dark, depleted mansion lined Madge's vision. The wood splintered from the floor, to the walls, to the ceiling. The gaping hole that hung above them left a patch of snow in the middle. The stairs creaked,without movement from anyone. The paintings and pictures barely covered the walls, and the eerie feeling rose immediately; and yet, even in a room like this, the girl found a gothic beauty before her. Edith stepped inside and tightened her shoulders. Each detail from her memory stuck out. She felt the soft hands of her ex husband as she walked in front of the snow pile. She glanced up at the stairs, where a broken railing hung. The pain in her back spiked, the thoughts flourished and the darkness brought anxiety. Her son didn't notice, and she didn't expect him to. \"Nothing's changed since I've been here,\" she said to no one in particular,\" Even the weather stayed the same.\" \"Believe me,\" John sat a trunk down,\" when it's completely built up again, we'll have a home that'll bring goodness and prosperity. Mr Wills has wonderful ideas. When we're done here, I'll take Diana to our bedroom, then the four of you can choose a room of your own.\" The children went off to a far spot in the house. It was a big room, covered with books and elegant belongings. Magdalena looked at several of the titles on the wall; most of them which she had never seen. Some- she could tell- were family albums. Her own book was in her arm, a new guide for what was to come. \"Look at this thing!\" Edward sat on the old stool, its fabric tattered and legs wobbling. He stared at the keys that were untouched for forever. He played Move It On Over as best as he could- or in the worst way possible. The boys' obnoxious singing echoed in the oversized room. Edith panicked, the fear of old spirits attacking. \"Boys, please!\" she begged,\" this isn't a place to be playing. You don't want to break that piano. Now, why don't we go see if your father needs help?\" The old woman watched her granddaughter, who studied the room. With regret, she walked out with the boys. She would only be a minute. The girl was unfazed by the three. She stared at the books, the organization well, despite broken shelves and dust in every crevice. Madge hoped the remodel would have walls of bookshelves- even a library, like back in America. The girl looked around, lost in the world around her. She looked over at a painting, of a woman she didn't recognize. The girl looked down at her book, and wondered if this had been Lucille, the woman of poison. Behind her, she heard a song being played. \"Grandma said to stay off of that,\" the girl mentioned. Still, the song continued. In annoyance, Magdalena turned to scold George or Edward. It wasn't one of her brothers. It was silence and thin air. The book in her arms fled to her chest. Madge tried to think rationally as she made her way over to the piano. It was now untouched, forgotten in an instant. The girl looked around, then moved onto the stool, the book in her lap. Slowly, and steadily, the girl's fingers glided across the keys. Madge knew the song she played- it was one her mom taught her- but she couldn't remember the title. It was something sweet and sorrowful and- \"Madge!\" The girl looked over to the entrance. The cover to the keys slammed down, which caused her to reel back. Her mixed emotions- thankful that her hands were alright and fear that it had happened on its own- pounded in her heart. She grabbed her book and stood up, walking quickly to the doorway. \"Coming mom!\" she yelled. Magdalena walked upstairs as she went to pick out her room. As she walked on the rotten steps, she heard the piano softly playing. Edith did too, looking down at the entrance of the room. It all came back.[Chapter 3] Hello everyone! I'm glad there are people that are enjoying my story. It means a lot to me! Anyway, enjoy chapter 3! The snow stopped for the night, but the cold remained. Even the fireplace couldn't keep the family warm. Edith felt the familiar winds on her fragile skin. The nightgown swept the floor, the only bit of comfort in the winter. The old woman continued her walk down the hallway, and stopped by the elevator. She studied the recognized frame and the latch. Shivers traveled down her back, not only from the cold metal, but the blood stains that were imprinted. Edith carried herself to the railing of the stairway. The broken part, splintered and decayed, still dropped off. The wood dangled at the edge, waiting to fall from the high floor. The only thing the woman could picture was the wretched lady, her eyes full of anger and bitter intention. The thought of the poison slowly taking her life, waking up each night to drops of blood made the old woman cough. She sat down on the top step and leaned against the wall. Her shaking hands covered her mouth, doing her best to calm herself down. After a minute, the mansion was reverted back to its usual silence. \"Are you alright?\" John stood outside of his bedroom, a candle flickered against him. The light reflected on the warmest sleepwear he had. His mother nodded and stood up, almost falling in the process. Her son helped her, gently placing her upright. \"Are you sure you should be here?\" he asked,\" In this house?\" \"Should you be?\" she replied. \"We're all in good health,\" the doctor shot back as she turned her around,\" Mom, I know you warn us about the house, but if it's so terrifying, why did you come?\" \"I won't be around for forever,\" Edith walked down the hall,\" I can only warn you about the dangers of living here. I'll do what I can to protect you, and Diana, and the kids. Especially the children. Even if I have to come back here.\" John kept an eye on his mother. Her movements were weak, and it was obvious that coming here took a toll on her. Her weary, yet wondrous eyes stared down at his feet. While the doctor felt guilt for what she was going through, he couldn't see the truth in it- and neither could his wife. His daughter was caught up in the lie, every thought and action connected to Crimson Peak. His sons couldn't spare a moment to care about the story. They didn't fear the ideas, but never doubted them either. Edith, however, had her beliefs onto Madge- and he wouldn't have it. \"Magdalena is almost seventeen,\" he mentioned,\" the boys turned twelve last November- this is the perfect age to be responsible and understand the truth about our world. They're safe in this house because they know better. They get that the myths in the book aren't real and that they have nothing to worry about here. Now, we should get to bed- my colleagues are meeting us in town tomorrow. Goodnight Mom.\" With the end of his tirade, John walked down the hall and went back into his room. Edith felt a violent wind blow against her bare neck, causing her to shrivel up and cough aloud. Her son didn't believe her and there was no changing his mind- she was sure of it. The family drove into town, the sun bright against the snow. It almost blinded the doctor as he moved onward. The back of the car was packed, the children and Edith unable to move. John talked the entire drive, his head in the clouds and mind only on his colleagues. After what seemed like forever, the family was finally exposed to the cold as they approached an office. The building looked new, with shiny windows and a red door. Dr. Elwin Foster was painted on the front, Dr.Finley Bargains ,both faded and in desperate need of a touch up. Dr. John McMichael was fresh on the glass. Madge questioned- to herself- why the town needed three doctors. His name in gold made the man smile as the family stepped into the doctor's office. They were greeted with a carpeted waiting room. There were chairs surrounding the beige room, a staircase that lead to a light upstairs. That was until a man walked down. He had a gracious smile under his thick beard, and a tall, wide frame. Behind him, was a bald man. He supported a mustache on his upper lip, and thin glasses around his eyes. He was short and thin, They were immediately recognized by John, who walked over and shook hands with the taller man. \"It's good to see you, Elwin,\" Dr. McMichael exclaimed. \"Likewise, John,\" Dr. Foster said. \"This must be your family!\" Dr. Bargains turned to the others that stood,\" I'm Doctor Finley Bargains, and my colleague Doctor Elwin Foster- come upstairs! My wife and I welcome you to our home.\" The group made their way up into a living room. It was half the size of the one in the McMichaels' American home. The lavish style of the Fosters was similar to their own. It gave comfort to the new family. On the couch was a brunette woman, who smiled and approached the guests. \"Hello!\" she exclaimed,\" it's so nice to finally meet you. I'm Julia- Mrs Foster. You must be Diana, you are as lovely as John described you.\" \"Thank you,\" the other woman smiled,\" this is my mother in law, Edith. And my children, Magdalena, and twins Edward and George.\" After they got familiar, the children went into another room. They were met by five other children- two that looked near the girl's age, and three other boys- closer to Edward and George. While they ran to the boys, Madge went over to the two on the bench. There was a girl, with her hair pulled back to show bright green eyes. The boy on the other side (his hair slicked back and a smile plastered to his face) turned his head to Miss McMichael. \"You must be Doctor McMichael's daughter,\" the young man and woman stood up,\" I'm Dylan- son of Doctor Foster.\" \"And I'm Grace Bargains,\" the girl happily announced,\" Daughter of- well, you know. I've heard that your father bought Allerdale Hall. Doesn't he know what went on and what still goes on?\" At least other kids believed in the story. At the mention of the deadly mansion, Dylan stiffened slightly. He looked to Madge, nervous, yet full of wonder. They anticipated her answer. \"He doesn't believe the stories,\" the girl admitted,\" Every time my grandma or I mention it, he shrugs it off like it's nothing. He's not one for spirits and ghosts.\" \"Hasn't he read Crimson Peak?\" Dylan piped up and walked over to the bookshelf. \"He's heard the story about a thousand times,\" Madge had a smile on her face,\" after all, his mom wrote the book.\" Dylan and Grace looked quickly to each other. Miss McMichael gently took the book from the boy's hands. She flipped through it, noticing how new the book was. The words were bold and the cover felt fresh. Madge observed the reactions of the other two. \"Your grandmother is Edith Cushing?\" Grace gasped,\"Then you must've heard the story a lot!\" \"I have a copy of Crimson Peak that I keep with me in the house,\" Magdalena explained,\" I'm guessing the both of you believe in what goes on.\" \"Of course we do!\" Dylan sat down,\" I went in the house, in fact. Last summer, Grace and I snuck out and went snoopin' around the ol' mansion. We knew somethin' was off when we got there.\" The Foster boy recalled hearing the piano throughout the entire house. Madge got a chill down her back, remembering the melody when no one sat at the stool. Grace swore that a woman kept crying, as if she wanted to be left alone. Each puzzle piece of their story fascinated Madge even more. She was amazed to find people that believed in Crimson Peak just as much as she did. She could tell they would get along well. \"Eventually,\" Dylan recalled with a laugh,\" I got so scared, I grabbed Grace and we got the hell out of there!\" \"He was shaking the entire way home,\" she interrupted,\" I was afraid that he was gonna rat us out- but he's kept his mouth shut to this day. That place is definitely haunted. Im not surprised if you've encountered something already.\" \"I have,\" Madge went on,\" Someone was playing the piano- no one was there. I think it's the ghost of Lucille-\" \"Dinner's ready!\" The younger boys scrambled off, prepared to scoff down their meal. The three older children slowly made their way to the door. \"You know,\" she said,\" you're going to meet my grandma- but I'd talk about the book after dinner. My father-\" \"We understand,\" Grace nodded,\" Before my mom died, she was a firm believer of the book. She would've loved to have met the Edith Cushing.\" \"You'll love her.\"[Chapter 4] Enjoy Chapter 4! \"We need at least six different bedrooms,\" John looked to Mr. Wills,\" I'd like this home to be in our family for years.\" The gentlemen sat in an office room. Dr. McMichael leaned on top of the desk, his palm flattened on the smooth wood. He refused to sit, as these plans only excited and agitated him. His eyes glanced back and forth on the giant paper the other man had. On the side, Mr Wills wrote John's requirement on another slip. There were several things the doctor wanted for his new home and nothing less. It caused concern from Mr. Wills. \"Sir,\" he warned,\" if you add too much onto the house, I'm afraid it'll sink. You don't want clay seepin' through your floor.\" \"A lot of adjustments have to be made, Mr Wills,\" John said, annoyance smothering his voice,\" I can't stress that enough. I want extravagant rooms and decor for my family, which means I have to take the risk. Now then, when do we start building?\" Downstairs, Diana worked in the kitchen. The dark, dusty place would have to do for now. The odd feelings she got as she wiped down the stove and table were growing with every movement. The only thing that made the withered room seem refreshed was the smell of cake. Diana knew the one thing that could calm her overworked mind- baking. It always proved to be a relaxing factor when she went through stressful events in life, however, the thought of being watched made her favorite activity difficult. The timer ticked loudly, and once it stopped, an enormous noise came from behind. Diana screamed and turned around. The only thing that laid before her feet were fallen pots and pans. The woman breathed heavily as she studied the scenario. The hooks in which her cooking appliances hung stayed in tact. It had to be \"Boys!\" she yelled, picking up the pans,\" Stop playing around with the pots and pans. You're going to break something and then we'll-\" Creaking behind her. Diana closed her eyes and picked up the last pot. She hoped Edith's stories were a myth, and that a ghost wasn't stalking her. The woman hung up the last one and turned around. Just an open cabinet. With the window open, Diana felt a little more at ease. She hadn't touched the cabinet since the family moved in here and thought it had been locked. Quickly, she shut it and went back to her baking. \"There's too many rooms in this house to count,\" Edward complained,\" Sometimes, I can't even find my own bedroom.\" The children were taking another walk throughout the home. They had yet to explore every room (some would never be touched, for they were locked) and they were curious. Madge, after spending a weekend talking to Dylan and Grace, had her heart set on finding the spirits. She knew they were still wandering, and whoever made the beautiful music had to know they were there. Lucille Sharpe, she thought, had to be the one- Madge was determined to find her. \"George!\" She noticed he was picking the lock of another room. \"It's our house,\" he replied back snarkily,\" We have a right to know what's around here.\" \"She's just scared because you might release some spirit that'll kill us,\" Edward laughed. \"Shut up,\" his sister scolded,\" If the spirits would go after anyone first, it'd be you.\" Edward, not believing in the tales, rolled his eyes. He found his sister to be overly paranoid when it came to Allerdale Hall. She obsessed over the idea of their new home being haunted, when the boys knew it was fake. Suddenly, the lock popped open. Without another word, Ed threw the door open and poked his head in. His brother, with the same level of curiosity, ran in after him. Magdalena, for fear that Lucille or other evil entities attacking the boys, followed behind. The room was familiar to Madge. In fact, Edith wrote about it in her book. It was the inventing room of Thomas Sharpe- her husband. There were toys on every inch of desks and shelves, each one unique and impressive. Plans for new toys and dolls were pinned against the walls, some torn and dusty, others in perfect condition. Madge read them, the signature of the man her grandmother loved on each one. Her fingers dragged across and studied their outlines. \"How could someone with a brilliant mind be so corrupted?\" she asked herself. \"He could've been our grandpa,\" Edward looked to a toy that had a small metal ball, hidden by a cup. Madge nodded, but didn't pay much attention. Her grandmother portrayed Thomas as someone who was the schemes were twisted and the relationship with Lucille was horrendous, the love they had could've been real. Edith never admitted it, but she missed Thomas- Madge was sure of it. \"Do you think Thomas would've been as good as Grandpa was?\" Edward asked. \"Of course not,\" Madge snapped away from the papers,\" Grandpa was good to us, and if he hadn't saved Grandma, we wouldn't exist.\" \"We would exist,\" George argued as he wound up a toy,\" because the Sharpes weren't killers.\" \"I don't except you to understand any of this,\" Madge mumbled. \"I thought this room was locked,\" Edith smiled as she walked into the room. She glanced from side to side, focused on the different memories before her. It was all too familiar, and while seeing the children in here made her happy, it caused her muscles to tense. Their eyes were full of wonder, and hers were full of regret. \"Your mom is making cake,\" she explained,\" Boys, why don't you come with me?\" Madge mouthed a thank you to Edith, who winked and went off with her grandsons. When they left, the girl basked in the silence and the inventions around her. She heard ticking on the floor, and became alert. She scanned the floor, getting closer to the noise. In seconds, she found a wind up mouse on the floor. With a sigh of relief, Madge picked it up and studied it. The mouse was cute, with a shiny silver body and big black eyes. The rusty fly on its back looked sturdy and handmade. Impressive. \"Edward,\" she told herself,\" Huh, this is a-\" The cold, loose grip on her shoulder was enough to make her drop the toy (however it didn't break). Magdalena looked to her shoulder, but found nothing there. She heard her mother call her name, and the feeling disappeared. In an attempt to find out if it was a spirit, the girl did the only thing she could. \"If this is Lucille Sharpe,\" she began,\" I don't want to harm you. I'll admit that I am afraid, and fear can be a weakness, but I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me. Do we have a deal?\" When the room became silent, Madge was called by her mom again. Reluctantly, the young woman left the room, closing the door behind her.[Chapter 5] Hello! I'm glad to be posting another chapter. I hope you guys enjoy! The room gave Magdalena some comfort. Its old feelings and squeaky floorboards were unnerving, but she found herself okay with this. She sat on her bed, nightgown reaching to the bottom. She placed the book on the nightstand, the candle put out with a simple blow. Madge heard her mother as she threw herself under the covers. The woman smiled and made her way over to her daughter. \"Goodnight, Madge,\" the woman said softly, a kiss on her daughter's forehead placed. \"Goodnight,\" the girl yawned,\" Mom, has anything weird happened to you in this house?\" Diana looked over, tempted to explain what happened in the kitchen that day. She could tell that her daughter wanted, more than anything, to find out that their home was still haunted. With a quick step to the door, Diana was halfway out of the bedroom. \"Oh, of course not!\" the mother laughed,\" I'm a bit tired, and I might have seen things- but it's only my imagination!\" \"Are you okay?\" Madge asked, concern and suspicion in her voice. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" she smiled,\" Get some rest, Madge, dear!\" Her mother's last words left her oldest child perplexed. She stared at the chipping ceiling, making pictures between moonlight and darkness. Every one of the figures she created reminded her of the house, and the stories her grandmother told. As Madge dozed off, the cracks became more of a scene. A ballroom, with glossy floors and candles all around, was full of people in only the finest outfits, danced around. The elegant music played softly as the strings were plucked and pulled. The bows were quick and skillful, and the men that played them were dressed properly. \"There she is,\" a beautiful woman gasped,\" and look at her dress! You look absolutely wonderful, ma'am.\". Confused, Madge looked down at herself. The girl was in a ballgown, the color of a pearl. It felt like silk, and it shone in the light. The beauty they held were mesmerizing, and she felt important. As she looked down, the woman saw a pair of black shoes. When she looked up, she saw a man, in his twenties (Madge supposed) with curly black hair and astonishing blue green eyes. For only a moment, the girl was enchanted by him, and his smile. Miss McMichael saw the face- but she couldn't recall where. \"You look beautiful,\" he reached a hand out,\" Shall we dance?\" \"Oh!\" she grabbed his hand,\" Of course-\" Before they could dance, a bang was heard. Madge woke up, annoyed that such a lovely dream had been ripped from her. She rubbed the back of her neck, trying to get back to sleep. Outside of her room, the girl heard speaking. It was an unclear woman's voice, and she sounded deep into a conversation. \"Mom?\" she called, loud enough for the woman to hear,\" Grandma?\" \"-they cannot be here,\" the new voice was stern, and approaching fast,' Not here, not here, not now! Not after what happened, I want them gone!\" The noise ceased for a second. Madge, in fear of whoever was at her door, held her breath. For a moment, the girl wondered if this was still a dream. She crawled across the bed, her hands sunk into the blanket. She was slow and quiet, still afraid of what was behind her door. Under the frame, an abundance of black smoke spewed. It crawled across the floor, and Madge felt her fears worsening. She felt her hands shaking and her heart rate increased. Then, with full force, a bang occured on her door. The incident occured again, sending the girl running back in her covers. \"Let me in!\" the woman screamed,\" You idiotic child! You-\" \"Leave that girl alone!\" This time, it was a male voice. It was old and soft, and it made the girl relax slightly. She eased up for a moment, but then a horrible shrieking pierced her ears. Madge threw her hands up, and did her best to block out the noise- however, it was to no avail. She screamed to push away the noise of the other woman. \"Go away,\" the daughter begged,\" please don't hurt me!\" The screaming stopped when, in a flash, John burst through the door. His expression was one of worriment for his daughter. Madge's tears covered her young face, only when her mother pulled her into a hug did the girl realize that she cried. Her brothers and grandmother stood outside the door, just as baffled as the parents. \"Magdalena,\" John spat out,\" what happened? Did someone try to come in?\" \"Did you have a nightmare?\" Diana asked. \"There was a woman screaming,\" Madge mumbled,\" I think she wanted to hurt me. She tried to get in, but someone told her to stop it. She wouldn't stop screaming...someone wants to hurt me.\" John furiously looked up. He knew his mother's stories were getting to his daughter. He went over as Diana comforted her daughter. \"It was only a nightmare, dear,\" she tried to reassure,\" no one is here to hurt you.\" \"Then why did she scream?\" Madge demanded to know,\" Why did that woman keep banging on my door?\" For this, the woman had no answers. She only rocked her daughter, afraid that her mother-in-law's stories were true. However, she could never tell her husband. \"You need to stop telling her stories,\" John stipulated,\" they are driving her crazy. Soon enough, she won't want to stay here.\" \"Good,\" Edith said as she turned away,\" she can't be in this house. It's a nightmare, and I can't have my family living here. You know what haunts this place, you know that I lived through Hell here. Yet you bought this house-\" \"I'm renovating,\" he simply reminded. \"It doesn't matter, John!\" She shouted,\" You put your wife and my grandchildren and yourself in danger. By being here, even if you fix it up, you'll never be able to fix what happened and what every woman went through. They're haunting this entire mansion, and you've done nothing about it.\" \"We'll discuss this later,\" he said through his teeth and stormed back into his room. Madge found it hard to sleep that night. In her arms, she held the book, unable to think about anything else.[Chapter 6] I am so sorry for not updating sooner. I've been busy with senior year and trying to come up with the entire story. Now, I think I have the perfect ending. Enjoy! The bell rang after what seemed like forever. George and Edward ran out with their new friends, after a long day of learning and boring teachers. Morgan and Louis Foster bounced on, with Andrew Bargains close behind. The five boys had gotten along ever since their first meeting. Much like their older siblings. With Andrew, came another kid, this time a young girl with little brown freckles and reddish-brown hair. \"George, Edward,\" he explained as they stood together, waiting for their older siblings,\" this is Sylvia Upton. Her older brother's friends with my sister.\" While they were getting to know each other, the older siblings walked out of the building. The younger kids walked on after they saw the others, and walked on to the doctor's office. Hours before, Madge had been introduced to Roger Upton. He had a thin, tired face that never strayed a smile away. His long legs raised above snow piles as he, Grace and Dylan listened to what their new friend had to say. \"-The first voice was harsh and a woman's,\" she explained,\" and the second was a guy's, but his was so much softer. He sounded like he wanted to stop the woman. And she- I think she wanted to come after me. Now, I know this may sound crazy, but I think it was the Sharpes.\" \"I believe it,\" Roger shrugged,\" Especially about Lucille.\" \"He should know about the Sharpes.\" Grace mentioned. Dylan grew uncomfortable for a moment. The only confused person was Madge, who did not understand the situation. Roger had never cared if anyone brought up the story. He looked to his books as he thought about the story he told oh so many times. Then, he smiled back up at Miss McMichael. \"My great aunt was a wife of Thomas Sharpe,\" he admitted. Madge felt her heart race and eyes bulge. She knew that there had been a few documented women that were wedded to Thomas. Edith hadn't show her much, not wanting to permanently scar her. \"Sylvia Upton,\" Roger went on,\" My grandfather always told me to keep away from that house. He thinks spirits still reside their. Especially that of my great aunt, odd as it may seem.\" \"It makes sense,\" she mentioned, her eyes lighting up because another believed,\" I've seen a lot of strange things in the house already. My brothers don't understand. They still think that the story's crazy and they don't have to read it just because Grandma wrote it. We're the only ones who have seen things and have had visions. I'm starting to think that, if they don't believe, that we'll all be in serious danger.\" From the front, the little children wondered what their older siblings were talking about. The twins simply ignored their sister as they hopped around the snow. \"Our sister and grandma think the house it haunted,\" Edward sighed,\" If you ask me, that sounds insane. George and I haven't seen a ghost floating around yet. And we won't be seein' any for a long time.\" John looked disgusted as he scanned the kitchen. He dreamed of a beautiful stove, with fridges that had been stocked with the finest foods. With a floor that didn't have splinters shoved in his boots. He knew his wife deserved a more desirable place for her baked goods. She had already christened the rusting, dying stove with a beautiful cake that (he would neglect to mention to her) had a smell of aged metal. \"I'll get new furniture once this room is redone,\" he told Diana as she stood in the doorway,\" I'll install new windows, tear up the floors and put up new wallpaper.\" \"At least let me pick the color,\" she looked to the ground,\" John, are you sure this place is safe?\" \"Don't tell me Mom got to your head,\" he said with a half-laugh. She bit her lip. Edith did have a point. She had nearly lost her life in a crooked, terribly aging house. One that gave off a haunting, chilling feeling. Her daughter had a nightmare only a day ago. Madge had never had a nightmare that made her scream and beg to be left alone. As a mother, this worried Diana. John saw the worriment in her eyes. He danced over and held her hands close to his chest. \"Don't you worry 'bout a thing,\" he promised,\" we're all gonna be okay in this house. I know that it seems terrifying, but change always was for our family. Remember getting married? Moving into our first house? The kids' births? We have nothing to overthink. Besides,\" he continued as he dropped her hands,\" I would never move into a place that could hurt our children.\" As he spoke, he noticed that one of the cabinets opened. The couple had noticed that the door swung itself opened during odd times, and often. No matter how it closed, or if it seemed to stick, it would always find a way to show its contents to the new residents. John simply chuckled as he slammed the door shut. \"And we're gonna remove this cabinet.\" His wife smiled, and left with little reassurance in her heart. She thought about Edith's book, and the struggles she went through. Deep down, Diana had a belief for the ghosts that stayed in Allerdale Hall. Of course, she would keep these thoughts locked away from John. He had not an ounce of belief inside of himself. John turned back to the floor and went to rip up one of the boards. He then heard the cabinet door slam open and glass shatter. He looked up, finding a broken bottle on the ground. It was small and full of a liquid that he had no clue about. John cursed under his breath as he wiped up the fallen spill. He took a whiff, but it had no smell. It seemed odd, but it pushed out of his mind as he tossed the glass out and tore up the floor, unaware of the fallen product's true power. ","Summary":" Enjoy the story!

I got this idea within minutes after the movie ended. Yes, its cliché, but I like this particular one. The events in this story hinge on the one night that Thomas and Edith had away from Allerdale Hall. I have spoken to the writer LadyLorena. While we may have similar starting points, the directions we are taking our stories are completely different. This story is also unconnected to my oneshot. Thank you to Laura for her help! Enjoy the story, SSD P.S- Merry Christmas! Also for my own reasons, Alan is just going to be a general surgeon. Late April 1902, Trinity College Library, Dublin Ireland. \" This really is a beautiful library. It is an architectural marvel.\" Edith thought with a smile. It was hard to believe that it had been nearly two months since the events at Allerdale Hall. The only outward sign was the scar under her left eye. Alan was worried how she was holding up otherwise. Even though she'd tried to get him to return to Buffalo, to return to his practice, he'd gotten a job at the teaching hospital attached to Trinity College. Edith had awoken in the morning and made the decision to head to the library where she could do some research for her book. She felt a bit nauseous when she sat up, but fought off the urge to lose what little might be in her stomach. She got out of bed and put on her gold dress before pulling her hair up into a chignon. Then she made her way to the library. Edith gathered the books she had been using and began making her way to the back of the library. As she passed by the stacks of books she heard a familiar voice. \"Edith, you look lovely today.\" She turned towards the voice to see Dr. David O'Neill pulling a book from the shelf. \"Dr. O'Neill, it's good to see you,\" Edith replied, with a smile. \"You're working on your book again I see,\" the doctor indicated with a nod of his head. \"Oh, yes,\" she answered. \"Do you mind if I join you?\" \"I'd be happy for the company.\" They made their way to the back of the library and sat opposite one another at the table. They worked in comfortable silence for a while before Dr. O'Neill started weaving an enchanted tale that had Edith hanging on his every word. ### She sat and listened to him for quite a while before realizing she should probably head back before Alan came home. \"Dr. O'Neill, I really should be getting back before Alan reports me missing,\" she said, getting up to leave. She felt a bit dizzy and grabbed the edge of the table, something that was not lost on the doctor. \"Are you okay Edith?\" he asked, coming around to her, concerned. A polite smile crossed her lips and she replied, \"I'm fine, I guess I just got up too fast, thank you. I enjoyed the story Dr. O'Neill,\" she said giving him a quick peck on the cheek. \"Thank you again.\" \"Have a good evening Edith.\" \"Thank you Dr. O'Neill, you have a good evening as well.\" Edith collected her things and started to make her way out of the library. Dr. O'Neill watched as she disappeared from his sight thinking if he were forty years younger, he'd consider courting Edith himself. Then he heard a noise like something or someone falling. He grabbed his bag and hurried around the stacks of books seeing Edith lying on the floor. Two young men were standing nearby, unsure of what they should do. \"You two,\" O'Neill said pointing at them, \"Don't just stand there, sit her up!\" He moved in next to Edith and knelt down, opening his bag. He pulled out a small packet and opened it before waving it under her nose. Edith's eyes fluttered open and she shook her head at the scent of the smelling salts. \"What happened?\" \"I'm quite certain you fainted my dear.\" \"Oh, I'm so embarrassed.\" \"Nonsense, it happens. However, I want to take you to the hospital to check you out.\" \"That's not necessary, but thank you.\" \"Necessary or not, I'm taking you there straight away. I will not take no for an answer Edith dear.\" \"Alright,\" she answered nodding. She let the doctor and the two gentleman help her to her feet. One of the gentlemen picked up the items Edith had dropped and handed them over to her. \"Thank you,\" she said to him. \"Shall we?\" Dr. O'Neill said offering his arm to Edith. She looped her arm through his and the two of them made their way to the hospital. ### Alan was just finishing up with his shift when he saw Edith come in with Doctor O'Neill. O'Neill even though he was older, still worked every shift with the energy of a man much younger than he. He made his way over to them, asking, \"What happened Edith, are you alright?\" Before Edith could reply, O'Neill replied, \"Your wife just had a minor fainting spell, Alan. I brought her here to have her checked out.\" Alan exchanged a look with Edith. This hadn't been the first time someone had assumed that in the past weeks since they made it to Ireland. Seeing the look, the older doctor asked, \"Am I missing something?\" \"A small misunderstanding: Alan is not my husband, but a very good friend of mine. I am a recent widow, Doctor O'Neill,\" Edith explained tightly. ### David just felt like he'd really put his foot in his mouth, before backpedaling, \"I apologize, my dear. And I am sorry to hear that.\" \"Thank you doctor. It's been hard, but I'm coping,\" Edith replied. There was no need to trouble the old doctor with more. To cut through the awkwardness he was feeling, David suggested, \"Well why don't you and I head over to my office, we should discuss what may be up with you, my dear.\" As they left Alan said, \"I'll wait for you Edith.\" ### Once they were settled in his office, O'Neill turned to Edith and asked, \"Have you had any other fainting episodes?\" David was really concerned and wasn't asking entirely under his pervue as a doctor. \"No I have not, though I have been feeling light headed at times over the past few weeks. Mostly it's after I get up too quickly. That must have been what happened at the library.\" Edith responded. She really wanted to return home. \"Have you had any other problems my dear?\" O'Neill pressed. He did not yet have all the pieces to the puzzle. Edith bit lip before continuing, \"It's just been some nuisance stuff.\" \"Please tell me, I would like to be able to help you,\" the older doctor persisted. Edith looked at him for a moment before moving on to, \"I've been feeling mildly moody, snapping at Alan a bit. Also I have been more tired than usual as well.\" She grimaced before remembering the most inconvenient of the nuisance symptoms, Edith finished the list of symptoms with, \"Also I have been nauseous for no apparent reason and the strangest of things set me off.\" David had been about to take a sip of whiskey before the young woman in front of him gave him her last symptom, which made him choke. He placed the glass down after he had finished coughing. Everything was clear as day to him now. Clearly concerned, Edith asked, \"Are you alright Doctor? Did I say something I should not have?\" \"I'm fine my dear. The whiskey went down wrong.\" He had to approach this carefully, as this was more than likely the last thing she expected. Turning towards her, he said, \"Edith my dear, please pardon me for being crass, but this is a necessary question: Did you have intercourse with your late husband?\" David had never seen anyone go as pale as the young woman in front of him in that moment, before blushing in a manner that would make the setting sun envious. \"Yes, one night. We didn't have that much time together. Why do you ask?\" He moved in front of her and took her hand saying softly, \"My dear, it only takes the one time.\" \"What only takes once?\" David fought the urge to squeeze the bridge of his nose. He was going to have to come out and say it to her. \"Edith, I believe that you might be pregnant.\" ### Those were the absolute last words that Edith was expecting to hear in the aftermath of the events at Allerdale Hall. Sure, she'd known that there would be a chance, but with everything that had happened, the fall, the firethorn tea… From what she'd read, her being pregnant made every symptom she had fall into place. After getting up slowly, she said, \"I will be getting back to you on that, Doctor.\" She felt as if she were in a daze as she walked towards Alan. When she got to him she said, \"We need to talk.\" ### Alan had a feeling that whatever Edith was about to tell him, was not going to be an easy pill to swallow. A/N 2: So… what do you all think?[Chapter 2] Chapter II: A Need for Bullshit Artists A/N: Extreme apologies for the long wait. I had a scene that was truly kicking me in the teeth. It did not want to get written. Thanks go out to Laura for her beta work, along with anyone else who helped. I appreciate it! Now, here is chapter two, and please don't mind the title. It's meant as a joke. Enjoy the chapter! SSD Marshall McMichael was worried about his little brother Alan. Back in January, he'd just went off to England in a hurry, giving him little information as to the why. He knew that it involved Edith, but next to nothing beyond that. He knew that Alan had been worried enough to bring his gun with him, which had been left it at the house in his haste to leave for the ship to England. Marshall had still been at the law firm when one of the paralegals brought a telegram from the office downstairs. He had been finishing things up before going on a business trip to Ireland that he would be taking next week and lasted a month. Opening it, he nearly dropped it to the floor as he read: Need your legal help stop Who do you know on this side of the Atlantic that can help until you arrive stop After reading it a few more times for good measure, Marshall quickly jotted down a reply telegram: What on EARTH happened over there stop You didn't kill anyone did you stop I will be over there later next week stop For the time being, contact Declan O'Neill stop He loves making trouble for the Crown stop Be careful Marshall supposed he would find out what happened over there when he got to Dublin. He just hoped that he wouldn't have to defend his brother for killing a peer of the Realm, no matter how low level he was. ### Nine days later, Marshall was back in Dublin. He liked these business trips here, as it gave him an excuse to see his old friend Declan. He also needed to get ahold of his younger brother Alan. However as he got to where he knew Alan would be at the moment, Marshall saw his brother leaving the place in a bit of a hurry. \"What happened, little brother?\" Marshall asked. His brother looked a little bit flushed and worn out. It looked like he had been arguing with someone. \"I'll tell you the story, over a drink,\" Alan replied. There were still things he was going to leave out. ### Edith watched from the window as Alan met up with his brother. She felt sorry that she'd told him to leave, but she'd just wanted to be left alone. Before any more thoughts could come to her, Edith had to make a dash to the water closet as a wave of nausea hit her. Ever since actually finding out she was pregnant, the nausea had become a part of her daily routine. Once it finished Edith leaned back against the wall. Suddenly so many thoughts crashed through her: Would there be anything wrong with the child, what would the child look like, what it would be like for them… Suddenly she remembered that twins skipped a generation on her mother's side, which sent her back to the toilet. Edith had already lost most of what little she'd eaten earlier. ### Marshall had nearly spat out his Guinness several times as his brother told him the story of his adventures in Jolly Old England. Those serial stories in the newspapers had nothing on what had happened. When his brother finished his tale, Marshall said, \"So let me get this all straight. You went off to England to rescue Edith. You leave your gun at my house, which it sounds like it would have been a good thing for you to have. You get stabbed in the gut, but Edith's husband stabbed you where it wouldn't immediately bleed out, to buy time to deal with his lunatic sister. He helps you down to the bowels of that place, leaves you there to go deal said sister. Edith comes back down and gets you out of the basement. Then after a bit of time Edith helps you back up out of the place, out into the blizzard from hell. During this, she manages to kill the sister. Things were quickly pushed under the rug by the authorities, and you two came over to Ireland. Now to make things even more interesting, Edith's turned up pregnant. Am I missing anything?\" \"Just what I've left out. It's something you'd be much happier not knowing,\" thought Alan before saying, \"No, that's about it.\" Then he remembered something Edith had mentioned. Turning back to his brother, Alan asked, \"Edith does not want the child anywhere near England. She knows, and I do as well, that there is little good that can come out of the land. Also the estate, what there is of it, is entailed. And even if it weren't, the law firm dealing with the probate case is reluctant to give it over to Edith. Probably because she's an American.\" \"But since Edith is pregnant with his child, the land would pass to the child, whether the firm liked it or not,\" Marshall replied. \"Not if the child was made to look as if it were someone else's...\" Alan said before Marshall interrupted. \"That would be incredibly complicated, someone would have to marry her practically right now to make it even plausible...\" Marshall trailed off before noticing the look on his brother's face, realization coursing through him. \"That's why Edith told you to leave. She doesn't like the idea very much.\" Alan took a deep breath, \"That's one of the reasons I left in a hurry.\" Marshall then got an evil grin on his face. Noticing this, Alan asked, \"What's so funny?\" \"If she agrees to this, I'll help you in whatever way possible. But you have to let me do one thing.\" \"What's that Marshall?\" Marshall's grin got even more warped, \"You have to let me tell our mother that you've married Edith. She'd have a fit!\" While neither brother hated their mother, now that they were older, both of them saw her for what she was. And she'd turned their little sister into a younger version of her. ### Edith usually liked being alone with her thoughts, but lately they seemed to betray her. Ever since finding out she was pregnant, her thoughts would always stray back to Thomas. Today they strayed back to that night, the night she had wanted more than anything. The night she and Thomas finally sealed their love for one another, and the night that started the downward spiral. They made their way into the tiny room, Thomas apologizing for the tininess of it. But she had loved it. It was warm and cozy and they were alone, something they'd never had at Allerdale Hall. And finally, they were able to be together in the most intimate way possible. Their kisses had been delicious and consuming. Edith remembered the look on Thomas's face as he'd crawled up her body. He'd looked feral, hungry, hungry for her, what she'd dreamed about since meeting him. He kissed her again, slipping his tongue into her mouth to tangle with hers. His kisses were all she'd dreamed of and more. Her hands slid down his body into his trousers, pushing them slowly down over the curves of his ass. She finally had what she wanted and it was more than she had ever expected. The feeling of him inside of her, the feeling of being one with him finally, left her euphoric and satisfied. Edith also wondered what Thomas's reaction would have been if he were still alive. She liked to think that he would have been surprised, but happy. He likely would have had doubts about his ability to be a good father, given what she now knew about his childhood. Thomas also would have been terrified on many different levels. Chief among them, if his sister had found out that he'd had sex with another woman. Edith shuddered at the thought of her finding out. That would not have ended well for anyone. \" How has the child beaten the poison?\" Edith wondered After thinking tonight, Edith knew what she had to do, to protect her child from ever going anywhere near Allerdale Hall. ### He was there. He would always be there to watch her. He was bound to her in death, and when she had the child, he would be bound to the child instead. There was also something he knew that Edith did not know just yet, and would not know for a while. A/N: Hm…. Who was that there? ;) The faceclaim on Alan's brother is Frederick Weller. There's going to be more legal stuff next chapter, everything is going to work out! Please tell me what you think! SSD[Chapter 3] Chapter III: Help from our Friends A/N: Another long wait for an update. Edith is… difficult for me to write, which is a very bad thing, for someone trying to write her. Any kind of advice for writing her in the future will be appreciated. Trying to write a writer is far from the easiest thing. Especially a stubborn writer. I also borrowed a scene from another story of mine. It fit the situation. Thanks go out to Laura for her beta work. Enjoy the update! SSD Edith slowly became aware of her surroundings, the pillows were soft against her face, she snuggled deeper into the covers wanting to retain the warmth and drift back off to dreamland. She sighed and rolled over, the sudden movement making her head spin, her stomach roiled in sympathy and nausea washed over her. She remained as still as possible trying to make the sudden dizziness go away but the nausea worsened. She felt the now only too familiar sensation wash over her in waves, growing like the incoming tide. Edith yanked back the duvet and sat up, the room seeming to spin afresh, or perhaps she was unable to stay still, it was hard to tell. She got to her feet, her legs wobbling like jelly and stumbled across the room. She felt as though she were trying to cross the deck of a ship in the middle of a hurricane. She felt so awful, tears began stinging her eyes, she took another few steps and collided with the dresser. She righted herself and felt like she was on a ship in the middle of a stormy sea. Edith opened the door, barely aware of her surroundings and knew she was going to be sick. Unable to walk due to the nausea and dizziness she slumped to her knees and crawled as fast as possible to the bathroom. She reached up and threw the toilet seat back just as her stomach heaved. The first few seconds were a welcome relief, the action easing her nausea. The hot, foul smelling liquid seared her throat and her abdomen ached as she heaved again, and again. She had a few seconds respite and gulped air, coughing and spluttering. She felt her stomach heave and threw her head forwards once again. Her throat was agony and her stomach screamed in protest as her stomach contents were fully emptied and she began to dry heave. Mercifully she only brought up foul tasting yellow bile. She was shaking and muttering slightly as the heaving began afresh. ### Alan felt that it was safe to enter Edith's home now after a few days. Marshall would be coming with him, hopefully to get things started. Marshall was more worried about entering the house without Edith's knowledge. Unlike his brother, Marshall had prior experience with a pregnant woman, his wife Mary. In the early days, things could be most… unpleasant for the woman. Mary had not been that ill, it had been smells that had mostly driven her up the wall. She'd also thrown things at him. He'd been lucky that her gun (Mary was from Texas among other things) was in the gun safe. Marshall had to move the gun safe to where Mary couldn't reach it. He'd been less than keen on getting shot anyplace! And Mary could hit what she aimed at with incredible accuracy. \"If what you've told me about Edith's symptoms is true, she'll likely not be feeling well at the moment. And I really don't want to get things thrown at me.\" \"If you would prefer to wait in the sitting room while I talk to her, you are free to do so.\" ### Alan went to the room Edith was in. She had just come out of the bathroom feeling a little weak. His hand rubbed along her face as he felt sorry for what she was going through at the moment. \"Marshall is here to speak with you. Are you well enough to speak with him?\" Alan asked worried. \"I will be alright, give me a moment to fresh in up.\" Alan left her a moment while she tried to make herself look presentable. She put on a change of clothes putting her hair in a bun. When she finished, she made her way down stairs seeing Marshall sitting on the couch across from Alan. \"Edith, it has been a long time,\" he said greeting her with a hug. She returned the hug. Hugging him briefly before sitting down. \"Nice to see you again,\" she said sitting next to Alan. \"I do wish there were better circumstances, but we need to discuss your options for the child.\" Edith nodded. Alan had mentioned that Marshall would likely be more than willing to help. Before Marshall could speak, Edith asked, \"What's the worst that can happen, if nothing is done?\" \"The child could be taken from you, especially if it's a boy. It could be construed that taking him or her from you would be in the child's best interest.\" Marshall almost growled out the last two words. There was a lot of true idiocy when it the Courts decided to do things that were supposedly in a child's best interest. \"What if we left Ireland? Headed back the US?\" Alan asked as Edith turned even paler at Marshall's statement. \"I cannot believe I am saying this, but staying in Ireland actually would make certain things easier, like forging the documents. All you need is a few pints, and you'll get your forged documents when you need them,\" Marshall smiled a little at that before continuing, \"My friend Declan owes me a favor from when we were still in law school. And he'd do this for free once he finds out that he's going to be able making things difficult for the English legal system.\" Edith had gotten up and was standing by the window, looking outside. Both men noticed that was rubbing her stomach. \"I'll do it. For the child. I don't want the child, boy or girl anywhere England.\" Edith's voice was strong. \"As you will. Alan and I will go and see Declan. Will you be alright alone?\" Marshall asked. \"I'll be fine. Go on, get going.\" ### Edith had agreed to marry him. Alan wasn't going to pressure her in regards to what kind of marriage it would be, at least initially. Edith was pregnant, the child would be her primary focus after he or she was born. The only reason he was at the hospital, was that it was time for his shift. Alan didn't really need to work, but the repetitiveness of his rounds helped him think. He wasn't expecting to see Doctor O'Neill still there. His shift had been earlier in the day. The old doctor was talking to a woman who looked to be about ten years older than Alan himself. They seemed to be old friends. \"Doctor McMichael, how are things moving along?\" The older doctor was somewhat aware of the plans that were going on. \"The papers just need to be signed.\" This had not been what Alan had imagined a wedding of his to Edith would be like. It was clinical and very little emotion. \"How is Edith doing?\" \"Not too badly. Still a bit sick.\" O'Neill shook his head, \"Usually that abates, but it can last throughout the pregnancy.\" Realizing that he had not yet introduced Alan to who he had just been talking to. \"I apologize. I should have introduced you sooner. Doctor Alan McMichael, this is Doctor Helen Magnus.\" \"It's a pleasure. I believe I was at one of your lectures a few years back,\" Alan said as he shook her hand. Before anything more could be said, Doctor O'Neill (after excusing himself from Helen) took Alan aside and whispered, \"Doctor Magnus may be able to help you with what you are attempting to do. She could help bury certain information so that it will never see the light of day.\" Alan had to give that some thought. Though he was uncertain of letting someone else in on the plan. Because if more people knew a secret, the harder it would be to keep. ### The future was always changing. It had been one of the first lessons he had learned after becoming a ghost. He also could see future possibilities. Some were good, others were bad, and two were truly horrible. The two truly horrible ones involved either history repeating itself or the premature death involving drowning. He was interrupted by the entity known only as Mr. Jordan. After waving the future possibilities away, Mr. Jordan said, \"The future is always changing. Do not torture yourself with what might come to pass.\" A/N 2: Again, apologies on the long wait. I do not own Helen Magnus or Mr. Jordan. I picture Mr. Jordan as Thomas Lennon from the new version of The Odd Couple. The movie that I got him from is titled Here Comes Mr. Jordan, where the character was played by Claude Rains (Captain Renault from Casablanca) There's also a poll that is directly involved with this story. Quite an important bit. I'd love to hear what you think of this chapter, hope it was worth the wait. The next update should not be as long. SSD[Chapter 4] Chapter IV: Family Business A/N: Now we're going to open the story with Marshall coming home to NYC. Unfortunately, some unpleasant characters on the American side of the Atlantic will come into play this chapter. Also I will be bringing Alan, Marshall, and Eunice's father into the mix. I know that in the movie, he wasn't in the picture, though for my purposes, he was on a business trip out West. Picture him as Scott Glenn, looking basically like he did in Silverado. Obviously a bit older than that, but that's the general look. As for Marshall's wife Mary, picture Kate Winslet, as she looked in Titanic. Apologies for the long wait. Thanks go out to those who helped. SSD Middle of May, 1902 Marshall had never been happier to be back home in New York. It meant that he was going to see his wife and daughter again. What it also meant was that he was going to need to explain to his firecracker of a wife that he was going to be bending the law in the short term future. He would not get into so much trouble in the States. If anyone was truly risking their law license, it was Declan. The English would not take kindly to what was being done. He smiled as he went to the telegraph office to send a message to let Mary know that he was back. Marshall knew that he would have to tell her at least some of what he'd gotten up to over in Ireland. The business that was not on the docket of the firm he worked for. ### \"DADDY!\" a tiny towheaded girl yelped as he came into his home. She ran right into him jumping into his arms, making Marshall stagger. \"Joan, sweetie, give your father some room to breathe. He only just got in.\" His daughter smiled. A short time later she yawned. Undeceived, Mary said, \"Go upstairs. I told you that you could stay up till your father came home.\" Too tired to even argue, their daughter, and currently only child meandered up the stairs. Once the door upstairs had shut, Mary looked her husband over. He was tired, but there seemed to be a tiredness that went beyond returning home from a business trip to Ireland. \"Something happened over in Ireland that has nothing to do with the firm. And don't bullshit with me, I can tell when you're lying,\" she warned before he could even open his mouth. \"Please sit down Mary. I have a story to tell you, and I do not know how it will end. I believe that I will need your help to make it as happy an ending as possible.\" Marshall was looking at her directly in the eyes. Mary sat down and listened to her husband's tale. ### When her husband was done with the story, Mary's eyes were wide. \"You can't make stuff like that up. Certainly more interesting than the newspaper serials. That was quite the adventure Edith had over in England,\" Mary shuddered. She was glad that she had not had to go through that herself. Before her husband could speak again, Mary added, \"And she's pregnant as well?\" The hits just seemed to keep on coming for Edith. Marshall nodded, \"She isn't doing too well. Morning sickness and nausea seem to have hit her hard as well.\" \"Well, I'm glad that I am not going through that at the moment,\" Mary had a small smile on her face. Not quite sure that he had heard his wife correctly, \"Excuse me?\" Marshall asked, inquisitiveness clear in his tone. \"It is going to be a good year for grandchildren for your parents. You're going to be a father again, I think sometime in November.\" Marshall's face split into a huge grin. Suddenly, Mary found herself being twirled in the air. \"Put me down, you string bean!\" Mary screeched. After one more twirl, Marshall put her down. Giving him a light kiss, Mary asked, \"I take it you are happy?\" \"Of course I am. I'm thrilled.\" Marshall's grin still had not faded. Mary knew that the news she was giving him next would likely wipe the grin from his face. \"On another note, your parents and your sister will be coming for a visit in a few weeks.\" Marshall groaned out loud. He would not mind spending time with his father (he planned to tell his father what had happened over in Ireland first), but his mother and sister were pieces of disturbance that he would rather not deal with. As if he did not have enough to do! Back in Ireland, Marshall had been all too pleased to be the one to tell his mother and younger sister of Alan's marriage and Edith's condition. And while he was still looking forward to telling them, he knew that it was going to be loud. At least in regards to his mother. ### Those few more weeks had passed, and Marshall was getting more and more nervous by the hour. He had distracted himself with all the work he had to do before the courts let out for the summer. Marshall wanted as peaceful a summer as possible and he knew that when his mother found out what he had helped Alan do and what he was going to do in the future, it would be far from peaceful. ### While the women greeted each other, Emmett McMichael noticed a look on his oldest son's face. It was a mix of pity, fear and grim satisfaction. Marshall knew that Mary would find a way for him to pay for it late, but he said, \"Dad and I are going to a club, Mary do you think you keep a handle on things?\" Even though Mary thoroughly disliked spending time with her mother and sister in law, she had a feeling that her husband was about tell his father what he had told her weeks ago. ### \"Are you going to tell me what secret you're keeping, or am I going to have to get you three sheets to the wind?\" They were both at the club, and in peace. Marshall sipped the whiskey before saying, \"It is a wild tale, father.\" \"Try me. I've heard so many stories of your Uncle Jake's that were just smoke and mirrors.\" Marshall smiled at the memory of his uncle's stories. His father then said, \"I am aware that this mess likely started after your mother and sister went to England and told me about a possible husband before my business trip out West.\" \"Your wits are with you as always, Father. Yes, that's when it started. But the story has not ended yet. There is much, much more to tell you!\" Emmett settled into his chair. He knew a long story when he saw one. ### \"I thought I had heard everything, but this is above and beyond anything I have heard before,\" was what his father said in a stunned whisper. \"Is there any more to the story?\" Marshall replied, \"I told you what I was told. I have a feeling that there were things that Edith and Alan did not tell me. Especially Edith.\" \"I always thought that your brother was too good for this Earth. Now I have proof. Not a man in 10,000 would do that,\" Emmett said, pride for the fact that his son was a good man. \"Mother is going to be apoplectic with rage. I was hoping you would be able to help me manage her and Eunice.\" Marshall was unable to keep the anxiety out of his voice. Motioning to the bartender, Marshall said, \"I'll have another drink.\" \"Make that two,\" his father said a short time after. They would need to have some booze in them in order to deal with Ruth McMichael's rage on this subject. ### When they got home, it was only an hour until dinner. Marshall and his dad had spent a good portion of the afternoon discussing strategy in regards to letting the cat out of the bag to his mother and Eunice. Both of them were very much three sheets to the wind. ### At dinner, both Marshall and his father were still drinking, if not as much. \"Don't you think you two have had enough?\" Ruth McMichael asked her oldest son and husband. She had been less than thrilled to see them come home in their drunken state. At least they'd been under their own power. \"Not nearly enough,\" Marshall mumbled with a slight slur to his words. McMichael asked her oldest son and husband. She had been less than thrilled to see them come home in their drunken state. At least they'd been under their own power. \"Not nearly enough,\" Marshall mumbled with a slight slur to his words. \"Excuse me?\" his mother asked sharply. Emmett snickered. He also noticed that his daughter in law Mary was fighting the urge to smirk herself. Marshall exchanged a look with his father who said, \"Just tell her now, and get it over with. She's got to find out sooner or later.\" He did not envy his son. \"What the devil are you two talking about?\" Ruth had a feeling that those two knew something she did not know. \"I have a story to tell you mother. I want you to stay quiet and NOT interrupt me until I am done speaking. Do I make myself clear?\" Marshall said in his best lawyer's voice. His mother nodded. Marshall took another belt of the Bushmills he had brought back from Ireland. He was definitely going to need it to tell this story again. ### Ruth had been listening to the story her oldest son was telling, seething the whole time. Her rage was building with every word he said. By the time Marshall was finished, her fingers were numb from her nails digging into her gritted fists as she fought the urge to fling something, anything across the room. She saw that her daughter in law was looking at her and not even bothering to conceal her smirk. Mary had likely already known what Marshall's story was going to be. Mary had also reached out and stroked Marshall's hand at a few points during the telling of the tale. In contrast, Eunice had gotten pale. She had not realized the bullet she'd dodged. Marshall went into in vino veritas mode, saying, \"Eunice, you are my sister, and I love you. But you would not have been able to get your way out of that the way Edith has. You would likely be dead.\" Eunice left the table in a hurry. In a deadly calm voice, Ruth asked, \"Was telling your sister that entirely necessary?\" \"I just wanted her to know the facts. After all, Alan and Edith will be returning to the States eventually,\" Marshall went back to cutting his meat. Before Ruth could make a rude remark, Emmett cut in, \"Ruth there won't be any talking Alan out of this. It's already happened. And when they do return, I expect you to be civilized.\" Giving her husband a look that told him that their discussion was nowhere near over, Ruth got up to go after her daughter. \"That went better than I thought it would,\" Mary murmured, \"I thought there would be more yelling.\" \"There will be,\" Emmett said while rubbing the bridge of his nose. \"She's just going to wait until we get back to Buffalo.\" \"I thought they were heading Washington DC?\" Mary asked. \"No there will be a short time in Buffalo, where I fully expect her to tear into me. There will also be letters to your brother.\" The remaining three went back to eating dinner in companionable silence. The next several months were going to be a wild ride to behold. A/N 2: I decided to cut chapter 4 here, since it could stand on it's own. I wanted to give you all something this summer. Chapter 5 will hopefully be out sometime next month. I would love to hear what you think of the new OC's! We will be back in Ireland next chapter. Enjoy and please tell me what you think! SSD[Chapter 5] Chapter V: Gone, But Not Forgotten A/N: I think I've got a good title for this chapter. It also fits the situation as a whole. While Thomas is gone from this life, Edith will never forget him. Shakespeare's Sonnet number 9 fits the situation as well. I recommend highly that it be looked up! There will also be some time jumps over the course of this year, trying to get to a certain event. Carolyn, I don't know what I would have done without you! You have been a godsend for this chapter! SSD Late May-Early June 1902 Meanwhile, back in the Green Hills of Ireland... Helen Magnus had come to Ireland for a few different reasons. One was to put distance between the prime timeline self of hers that was living her life. Another was that Ireland was always teeming with abnormals. She had already found an entrance to Hollow Earth and was starting to use it to make an underground Sanctuary. She had not expected to be actively using her degree in medicine at this time. But her father's old friend David O'Neill (and an abnormal with a slowed rate of aging) had asked her to do a favor for him and help a young woman and her new husband. After being given the short version of the story, even Helen had shuddered. She had remembered reading about the murder of the mother, and being shocked at the brutality of it at the time. The article had been quite unclear as to who had murdered the mother. And with good reason, if what David had told her was true. When Helen had asked David of how Edith had figured things out, he had only said that it had come as a shock. Soon, Helen would meet Edith. When Dr O'Neill entered the examination room he was accompanied by a woman. At first, Edith assumed she was there as chaperone for a formal examination, in case Edith preferred a woman to be present. \"Edith, this is Dr Magnus. She's here visiting for a while and I asked her to join us. I think it might do you good to talk. I'll leave you to it.\" Dr O'Neill left the room. Edith was so very tired all of a sudden. She looked at the woman Dr O'Neill had introduced her to. Things were changing but it was still fairly unusual to get a woman doctor. Dr Magnus was a serious looking brunette with kind blue eyes. She smiled at Edith, and for some reason Edith felt immediately reassured. \"Dr O'Neill tells me you have been having an uncomfortable time, Edith,\" Helen decided to start the conversation. \"Yes. I have had some dizziness, a lot of sickness.\" \"But that's not all is it? I can see you are troubled, too. I understand that for some women pregnancy holds deeper issues besides morning sickness.\" Helen would let Edith tell her what she wanted of the situation. Edith thought for a moment. She found Helen's voice soothing, and felt that she should be able to trust her. There were things she did not think she could tell anyone, but there were also things that would be safe to say to Dr Magnus. \"The baby is my first husband's.' She paused, aware that to most observers this circumstance would be ideal. She thought it showed empathy and intelligence that Dr Magnus said nothing, just waited for her to continue. \"He is dead. He was murdered.\" Edith found it surprisingly hard to continue. \"His sister.. was… not well. Mentally. She tried to poison me, and murdered.. Thomas.\" She could not yet voice the fact that before Thomas had realized he loved her, she too was intended for murder, possibly even at his hand. \"I am also worried that the baby might have been damaged by whatever the poison did to me.\" \"Well, that might well trouble you. Has anything happened since you found you were pregnant to make you worried for the child?\" David had left the poison out of what he told her. He had either withheld information, or Edith had not told him yet. \"Edith seems to being more judicious when it comes to trust,\" Helen thought to herself. \"No, nothing specifically, I don't think. It is just a general unease. I have much to be grateful for, you understand. I have the child of a man I loved ...very much… growing within me. Although I no longer have that man at my side I feel that he cares for me still. Indeed, I have reason to believe that without him I would not be here today..\" Edith felt herself almost - almost - confiding those deepest secrets with this woman she had only just met. She fell silent. \"I too lost a man I loved, Edith. I also lost my daughter. I promise you I will do everything within my power to ensure that your child is safe.\" Helen still left a few things out, since Edith would likely not believe her. \"Dr Magnus…\" Edith paused. \"Helen, please\" Helen smiled, putting Edith at ease. \"Helen,\" Edith smiled back. \"I have certain… beliefs. Based entirely on personal experience, evidence that satisfies me completely.\" She took a deep breath. \"Helen, I know ghosts exist. I have seen them. My husband's ghost saved me from his sister. There were previous … happenings, which I cannot speak of yet. Reasons…. I\" She paused, unable to continue. Helen took her hand. She had a feeling that Edith was in all likelihood an abnormal. A medium to be precise. \"Edith, there are people who have certain - abilities. They may not be consistent, they may be frightening, or confusing. They may not be things those people can speak of in public. But you may always speak freely to me. I have seen ample evidence that the world is not just what we see. I think you can sense that. You have not told anyone this, have you?\" \"The first ghost I saw was my mother's. I was a child then. I have seen many since, but I have never told anyone now living, except Alan, when we were children,\" Edith replied. \"That is probably just as well. There are those who would consider it a sign of instability, and that is a burden you do not need, especially now. You said that your husband's sister tried to poison you. It would be helpful to find out what that was. What were the symptoms?\" \"I was sick and dizzy often, scoured sometimes. I also sometimes had sores in my mouth. Later I started coughing up a little blood, and I was very weak,\" Edith recited. Helen raised an eyebrow. \"Could you link any of the symptoms to anything in particular? Anything you ate or drank?\" \"Lucille would make me tea. It was strong and a little bitter. I believe the tea was at least sometimes to blame. Thomas eventually told me not to drink it, so I stopped, but I did not improve completely.\" Helen looked thoughtful for a moment. \"I have a feeling I seem to recall…\" A noise from outside the door alerted them that Dr O'Neill was about to enter. \"We will talk again soon, Edith. I will be looking after you along with Dr O'Neill,\" Helen told the much younger woman with a smile. \"Thank you, Helen. I am glad of it.\" Edith was surprised she had felt so at ease confiding in Helen, hoping, trusting, it was the right thing to do. \"Dr O'Neill, I have a couple of ideas about something which I want to check. I will be back shortly.\" Helen left the Doctor and Edith together in the room. She had an idea which she sincerely hoped was wrong, otherwise things could still go very badly for Edith. And for her child. Ten minutes later Helen Magnus composed her face, knocked curtly and opened the door into the examination room. \"Dr. O'Neill, might I have a word with you?\" The doctor smiled at Edith and followed Helen out of the room. \"Doctor, I have a feeling that Edith was given Firethorn as a tea.\" Helen had really wanted to be wrong about her suspicions. The doctor looked shocked. \"But why on Earth would anyone give her that?\" \"It is the only plant which covers all the symptoms she listed but is cumulative and would act slowly enough that it might look like a natural degenerative illness over a few weeks or months. The only possible reason is to kill without too much immediate suspicion.\" \"To kill…?... But the effects may still be working on her! And what of the baby?\" \"The symptoms were quite advanced. She had got to the stage of coughing up blood from the chloroform and ether compounds. I have to say that, frankly, it is a miracle that she still lives, let alone carries a child. We can give her a saline infusion into the vein to try to ensure that her system can flush through any remaining poison, and stop any potential further damage. Other than that, at this point there is little we can do. I suggest we do not tell her there may still be complications. We need to keep an eye on her, heaven knows what affect firethorn would have on the child.\" Doctor O'Neill hurried off to gather the requirements for a saline drip while Helen went back into Edith's room. \"Well, Edith, I think we have narrowed down the culprit for your symptoms, and Dr O'Neill is going to put you on a saline infusion to flush out any remaining poison. It should make you more comfortable, and may even help with the morning sickness, as it will stop you from becoming so dehydrated.\" Edith looked into the clear blue eyes. They were darker than Thomas's eyes. She was not entirely certain Helen was telling her absolutely everything, but she saw no actual deception, and she did trust her to do whatever needed doing. She nodded. \"I am happy to put myself in your hands then.\" Dr. O'Neill returned and inserted the needle into her arm for the saline drip. Edith lay back, and for the first time in quite a while she actually felt relaxed. \"I remember my mother's twin sister being put on an infusion when she was expecting my cousin. It sounded like magic to me as a child when I read the letter,\" Edith smiled at the memory. \"I'm sorry..?\" Helen looked at her sharply. \"Your mother was a twin?\" \"Yes, twins skip a generation….. Oh!' Edith paled and her eyes went wide. \"Do you think….?\" Helen and Dr O'Neill looked at one another. Both realised that this could mean a whole new set of problems and complications, especially if the poison could not be flushed. \"Don't worry about that - it will be a few weeks yet until you are far enough along for us to be able to hear whether there are one or two heartbeats. As soon as you are we will all be able to listen.' Helen took Edith's hand. \"I am afraid you will have to be patient, Edith.\" On the other side... He was quite pleased that there were competent doctors involved in flushing what might be left of the poison in Edith. Of course, he knew something about the good Doctor Magnus that Edith did not: that there were currently two Helen Magnus's and this one had been the victim of being trapped on the wrong side of a time rift. Good thing she was effectively immortal. \"All the better for Edith then. This doctor's knowledge will help her all the more. Especially with future medical knowledge.\" The next few days were better for Edith. The saline drip had helped, she was feeling much better, though certain smells still did not sit well with her, causing immediate running to the water closet. She still wasn't eating much, since most things still smelled or tasted awful. She could not believe that she had forgotten that her mother was a twin, and with that came a generation skip. Then again, things had been rather chaotic. Edith smiled a bit at the thought. She could have two children to cuddle. Meanwhile back at the hospital, Alan had gotten some unexpected mail from back home. It was in a pile on his desk. There were three letters addressed to him. And they were all in different handwriting. One was a letter from Marshall (he had been expecting that one), a letter from his father, and one from his mother. The last one was one he was not looking forward to reading. He had a fairly good idea what it was going to say. \"Should I even bother opening it? When I know exactly what it is going to say,\" Alan thought to himself. His mother had never been overly fond of Edith. And the events in Buffalo involving the Sharpe siblings, had only made things worse. Now with what he was doing to help Edith and the kid, his mother was likely apoplectic with rage. He decided to just throw the letter out. There was no real point in reading it. His mother's ire would be dealt with when they returned to the US. It turned out that Edith also got a letter from Ruth a few days later. Like Alan she just threw it out. She had more important things on her mind than Ruth McMichael's spleen. Like trying to keep more food down. Food as a whole still did not agree with her. Helen was focused on trying to keep her iron up among other things. But nothing smelled good at all. And what smelled halfway decent, she had trouble keeping down. Again she found her mind wandering back to what the kid and/or kids would look like. About whether there was going to be anything wrong with them, due to the poison. Edith tried to think about something positive. There was a large part of her hoping that the child would get Thomas's blue eyes. As June wore on, it became more apparent that Edith was pregnant. And made the three doctors that she was around suspect all the more that she was having twins. She'd already bought some maternity dresses though even the act of buying them was a challenge. The women of Ireland were quite shocked to see her about once she started to show. Edith had taken her time (as far as she could), and found materials she liked. She also managed to find a wonderful dressmaker, by a chance encounter with a woman in the hospital in an elegant maternity gown. The dressmaker, Aideen was very kind. Aideen told her the name meant 'little fire', and it suited her, the bright, warm spirit that she was. Once Edith had favoured the huge leg-o-mutton sleeves, almost (she now thought) a symbol of her girlish vigour and fertility - appropriate for the fashionable, wealthy young woman, unconsciously 'on the market', blossoming, ripe and ready for a husband's seed. Now, in the light of harsh reality, the fashion felt inappropriate, an indulgence she no longer invited. Her short marriage had left her, at least for now, more serious, more guarded, and this reflected itself, not entirely consciously, in more sedate attire. Her new palette was subtle greys though, not the black or purple of deep mourning, which might be expected of her. Thomas was gone from her physically, but he was still within her, as deep a part of her as her own soul. So she found herself in the hands of a good dressmaker, talking side fasteners, fan-pleats and expanding skirts, and discussing corsets. Edith's newfound saviour was something of a progressive, given her head. Aideen always managed to cheer Edith's spirits. between them they agreed that she should forego corsets, rather than strap herself and her new child into a maternity corset. She was slim and did not need to worry about the support, and Aideen felt she would be far more comfortable, especially if she were indeed carrying twins. The only thing Edith had been completely certain of from the start were the touches of deep blue piping in the dresses. The colour of Thomas's eyes. By the beginning of July everyone felt Edith was far enough along to try to detect the child's heartbeat. She sat in the clean white room at the hospital, with Dr O'Neill, Dr Magnus and Alan all around, as excited as she to find out. Helen had helped her out of the clever expanding skirt and underskirt Aileen had made for her, and in her petticoat she lay back on the bed. The air was almost static with expectation. Dr O'Neill took out his Laennec's Monaural and applied it to Edith's growing belly. He listened for such a long time, moving the scope around slowly, eyes closed in concentration. Eventually he stood up straight, a serious look on his face. \"Well, Edith, I hope you are prepared for a long labor and a full nursery.\" His mock-serious manner took Edith a full two seconds to see through. \"Oh! Oh it is twins!\" Edith was by turns overwhelmed and elated. She didn't know whether to laugh or cry, so she did both. The room had occasionally before seen this many people in it smiling and hugging and shaking hands; but this time there was also one present who could do nothing but observe, and rejoice, and fret, and worry, and love. Early August, and the weather was driving Edith mad. It was a summer of thunderstorms, high humidity and occasional heatwaves. She could not get cool indoors or out. She divided much of her time between Helen's somehow cooler house, where she spent a lot of time, both doors and the window open for light and air, and the cloister-like courtyard at the hospital. By the last week of August and edging into September, though, she was ready to scream, could she only muster the strength to do so, and even the walk to either of the sanctuary was too much alone. She had taken to going to the hospital with Alan whenever possible, even on early shifts, because she no longer felt up to walking unaccompanied. The repeated thunderstorms gave her terrible headaches, and these combined with the extended nausea left Edith exhausted. Helen and Dr O'Neill were worried still about the poison. Helen reasoned that the months of saline drips must have flushed much of the residue from Edith, but what if too much damage had already been done? Edith was obviously far weaker than was safe. The nausea she still felt could no longer be attributed solely to morning sickness, not this far in. The babies were due in little more than a month. She decided to get Edith to stay at the sanctuary for a few days, so she could observe her. \"I am alright really, I am sure. I would know if there was anything wrong.\" \"I just want to keep an eye on you. This is a delicate time for any woman carrying twins.\" Helen's voice was gentle, reasonable. But she was serious, and did actually look worried. Then - \"Edith, I need to be completely honest with you. The time has passed for conjecture and tact. I am worried about the lingering effects from the poison. I am worried about your continued nausea. You have lost a lot of weight, your babies are taking their nourishment from you whether you have it to spare or not. It has got to the point that I am afraid you will become too weak to birth them. Yes we can perform a cesarian section, but that is not good for you either if you are too weak. Please stay here so we can take care of you?\" \"I have a place out in the countryside. It's quiet, and a bit out of the way. But it would be good for you.\" Edith was taken aback by Helen's bald statement. She had not considered that the nausea was anything other than protracted morning sickness, perhaps because of the twins. But she was weak. She saw the wisdom of acceeding to Helen's plea. She nodded. 'I will stay in the countryside if you believe it is the right thing to do.' The other observer in the room was as relieved as Helen at Edith's agreement. A hand rested on his shoulder. \"You cannot do anything here. You know she is in the best hands possible. Come away, and do not fret yourself. She is another's now.\" Of course, Mr Jordan was right. He was always right. But Edith still needed him. And he still needed her. He always would. After a week under Helen's care, with whatever magical concoction she had come up with in the drip, Edith's weight began to stabilise. She did not feel actually much better, and she still suffered bouts of nausea, but she was definitely gaining weight and did begin to feel stronger. She took her morning exercise in the sanctuary courtyard. It was much better out in the countryside, out of the city. At the beginning of September the temperature had settled, and there were fewer thunderstorms, though the humidity was still high and it rained heavily at least every other day. The stone seats at the sanctuary were hard and cold, and both Helen and Dr. O'Neill had banned her outright from sitting on them without a cushion. Edith smiled as she took the cushion from under her arm and placed it on the cold stone. Seating herself, she found it hard to get comfortable today. Over the last couple of weeks the twins had taken up Irish dancing in homage to their country-of-birth-to-be, and as she tried to get comfortable they started a merry jig on her spine. Suddenly their dancing grew into what she first feared was a frenzied struggle to escape her, but her waters remained intact. The pain swamped her. The cry of pain caught in her throat. She could not sit. She could not stand. She tried to breathe slowly and deeply, to override the pain, but it was too much, and weak at the knees she reached out to lean on one of the stone pillars. As she did so, she felt an intense cold and an overwhelming sense of calm suddenly washed over her, driving away the pain. A hand. It was a hand over hers. She looked up, and saw a figure with shimmering light outlining him. He was dressed entirely in black, with his face covered, save for his eyes. Edith knew those eyes. Just for a second, so brief that afterwards she almost could have persuaded herself it hadn't happened, though she knew in her heart that it had. He had come to her. She had been alone and in pain, and he had come to her. Then he was gone. Both hands to her mouth, suddenly bereft again, and shocked, she stifled a sob at this second loss, backed senselessly against the stone wall. But she came back to herself, looking briefly about to make sure she had not been observed, dashed a tear from her eye, smoothed her skirt. The pain was gone. He had taken it away. She could have gone to tell Helen, should have gone to tell her about the pain. She might have been able to explain it to Alan, even. But instead, she sat, alone in the country courtyard, composed and still now, and bathed in the warm knowledge that her Thomas was her Thomas still, and always. Thomas knew he was going to get it from Mr. Jordan after doing that. Ergo, he was quite reluctant to head back. When he finally did come back he got a \"I suppose you thought that was a good idea?\" \"It seemed like a good idea at the time,\" Thomas snarled. Mr. Jordan rubbed the bridge of his nose between his fingers, before saying, \"I'm not even going to ask you to apologize, because I know that it would be a meaningless one. At least your face was covered.\" \"I'm pretty certain she knew who I was,\" Thomas replied. \"I'm sure she did. Do you think she'd tell anyone you were there,\" Mr. Jordan asked. \"Not sure. She might, since Doctor Magnus has an open mind,\" Thomas said. \"It won't be much longer,\" the older entity remarked. \"I know. What I did will help her when that time comes,\" Thomas replied. Helen was pleased when James came for a chat. One of the maids had let him into her lab. Edith was resting in her room. \"What are you trying to make Helen? You never were much of a chemist,\" he remarked. \"I am trying to make Nitrous Oxide,\" she replied not taking her eyes off the apparatus. \"Why?\" \"Because it can be used as a painkiller during childbirth and is one of the rare ones that has little negative effects on either the mother or the children,\" Helen replied. James then asked a question that he'd been wondering about since this Helen's arrival, \"From the future, what would you want the most?\" \"At the moment? I'll settle for an ultrasound, it's a way I could see the babies, and see which position they're in. Definitely would have loved some medicine for Edith that would have got the nausea under control sooner. Also a reliable painkiller, if she wants it. That is why I'm trying to make Nitrous Oxide.\" \"Let me help. I was always a better chemist than you are,\" James said as he took off his jacket. After helping with the laughing gas, James decided to stay in Ireland for the foreseeable future. \"You might need some help when her labor starts,\" he'd said. While Helen knew she could manage on her own, she wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth. James was a skilled doctor and surgeon. Another pair of hands would likely be useful. Through the rest of September Edith found herself getting almost jittery, expecting the twins to make their escape any day, any hour. She was not sure which she dreaded most - an early arrival or being pregnant for much longer. The unbearable humidity of August and early September had at least given way to less uncomfortable weather, but Edith was still having trouble coping with the twins dancing. Edith had been unable to get Thomas's eyes out of her mind. That simple act of love and protection, and she was utterly certain that he had really been there, had brought her so much comfort. Her beloved had come to her and she knew that he watched over her still. She wondered if she would ever really see him again, whether that one visit would be all she got. She spent too much time, she knew, with this thought in her mind. Thomas may come to her, may still love her, as she still loved him, but he was gone from her physical life and she must accept that and live accordingly. October began with a light mist of rain that kept Edith indoors, pacing the rooms of Helen's home. \"If you don't stop walking about you will lose all the weight we managed to put on you and wear yourself out,\" James chided her gently. Edith laughed. \"I'm sorry, I can't seem to rest today. It must be the change in the weather. And the twins are moving around a lot.\" She absently rubbed her belly, hoping the contact would calm the babies in the same way she hoped her constant talking to them calmed them. \"They are? More than over the past few weeks?\" \"A little. Do you think they are planning an escape?\" \"Well, they'll have to come out at some point and they are fairly near due. Will you be careful to rest, Edith, and let us know straight away if anything feels different,\" James asked. I will. I promise,\" she'd assured him. And that had been a week ago. And still no babies. But on the other hand, their cavorting had lessened. She sighed, closing the book she was trying, and failing, to read, had been failing to read for two days now. She suddenly felt so parched. She needed to drink something, stood to go to the kitchen and it hit her. She doubled over, more in surprise than pain, as she felt the contraction. She managed to breathe through it, rode the discomfort, leaning hard on the table, almost tipping it over. A flood of emotions overwhelmed her, surprise, joy, fear, love. As the contraction began to subside she took a deep breath, drew herself up and walked from the room calmly, to find Helen and James. Five hours in and still no babies. Helen had ordered her to her bedroom as soon as she found her, insisting that she lie down and conserve her energy for what might be a long labor. Now Edith was partly happy to have obeyed, and partly worried that she might go mad with boredom if the labour did not speed up. Only a few further contractions so far, but she had to admit that they were tiring when they came. \"You seem to be going along well enough, at least. Not too much discomfort?\" Helen was still worried about Edith and the babies, but was not about to let Edith realize that. \"None, really. The contractions have not been painful, exactly, so far.\" \"Good to hear. I managed to cook up a little something that will help later if things get uncomfortable for you.\" As she spoke a big contraction hit Edith, making her pale, and slicking her forehead with a beading of sweat. Helen took her hand and helped her breathe through it. \"That one was a little stronger...\" Edith smiled a little faintly. Helen and James conferred outside Edith's room in whispers. \"It's been five hours and the contractions are barely closer together. I hope she is strong enough for a long labour. It doesn't look like she's going to get much rest and each contraction is only making her more tired.\" James was concerned. \"Well, I suppose if it comes down to it there is the option of a cesarean. But I'd rather not, frankly. I don't think it would be the best for her or the babies,\" Helen reminded her friend. \"No, I agree, if we can get her through this as naturally as possible it will be safest for all three of them,\" James conceded before saying, \"A cesarean should only be a last resort.\" They heard Edith through the door, panting as the next contraction hit her. Another five hours passed without much change, but Edith was beginning to get very tired. The contractions were starting to get stronger, but her waters hadn't broken and Edith was not sure whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. \"Do you think everything is alright?\" She asked Helen, for the first time that day. Helen thought it had shown great trust as well as strength of character that Edith had not asked this earlier. \"Their heartbeats are strong and steady. I think they are just taking their time, that's all. They want to stay where it's warm and safe a little longer,\" Helen soothed. Edith was relieved. She had felt so calm throughout, so far, and she was not even sure why. She half hoped that Thomas was with them, watching, somewhere, but she could not sense or see him. She lay back, wishing she could see him again, then felt guilty that she had not first thought of Alan. She knew Alan loved her, and she knew he would love these children, because they were hers. She knew that he was a good man, but she was not sure she would ever feel for him the way she had felt for Thomas, the way she still felt for Thomas. She did love Alan, he was her dearest friend, but the love that should be between a husband and wife would take time. A strong contraction swept through her, and the candle beside the bed flared a little, unnoticed by her as she breathed through the effort, eyes closed. Another watched, wishing he could hold her and help her bring his children into the world, knowing his part in this was over now, and he could only observe and love her across the distance between their worlds. \"It's been nearly fifteen hours and her water hasn't broken yet. Do you think we should risk breaking them manually?\" James was growing concerned over the lack of progress. \"If we had access to the equipment I had in the future I might, but not here in this time. It would be too risky. We have to just wait. I'd be more concerned if they broke and she still didn't dilate properly. I must be honest, I am surprised she's opening so slowly. There has been no sign of the show and yet the contractions are getting stronger. I am sure they must be ready soon,' Helen said to her friend. \"And there are two of them to get out. They really don't want to leave her. Stubborn little ones,\" James muttered with a small grin on his face. Twenty hours in and Helen was checking Edith over. The babies were still sounding good, but Helen was still concerned at the slow going. She was checking Edith for dilation when - \"Ah!\" and she popped up from between Edith's knees with a piece of cloth with an unpleasant sticky streak. She was smiling broadly. \"Oh, what on earth is that?\" Edith looked worried and a little disgusted. \"The show. The mucous that seals you up while the babies grow. It has come out, which is a very good sign indeed. It shows things are heading in the right direction.\" Helen was relieved. She thought, \"Finally things are moving forward!\" A little over half an hour later, Edith put down the book she had been trying to read to pass the time. She felt so uncomfortable that she got Helen to help her upright so she could walk round the room. As she did so she felt liquid course down her leg. She looked at Helen, a mixture of embarassment and relief on her face. \"My water...\" \"Now we're getting somewhere. Don't worry about that, I'll take care of it, it's just your body preparing for the birth. Do you still need to walk around,\" Helen asked. \"No, actually I feel a bit less uncomfortable now,\" Edith replied \"Good. Let's get you cleaned up and changed, then you can lie down again. From here on in things may get a little more painful as your body prepares for the babies to come out. I can't give you any timetable, still though, they will come when they are ready.\" Once Edith was clean and comfortable back on the bed, James brought in the cylinder of Nitrous Oxide he and Helen had managed to make. \"If you get a lot of pain, Edith, just put the mask over your mouth. Breathe normally in through your mouth and out through your nose, and it will ease the pain, or at least you won't mind it so much. You will feel a little light headed and possibly giggly, but the pain will diminish,\" James instructed. \"Giggly?\" Edith smiled. She had not anticipated feeling 'giggly' at any stage of this procedure. \"One of the side effects I'm afraid. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe for you and the babies.\" He patted Edith's hand reassuringly. It was almost midnight, and Edith had lost track of time. The contractions were getting closer together and they had started to get stronger over the last couple of hours. She had not had any of James's gas, but she realized she may have to once they got worse. Another wave rolled over her, and she breathed through it as Helen had taught her. They were starting to feel different. \"Helen?\" she called softly - Helen had fallen asleep in the dressing chair. She stirred immediately when she heard Edith call. \"Edith? Are you alright?\" \"Oh, Helen, I think it's finally time!\" A wave of pain rolled through her, a strong contraction and a deeper feeling within. Helen came to the bed, lifted Edith's knees and examined her. \"Oh that's much better. You are starting to open properly. Is it sore?\" 'It feels like something pinching me inside.' \"You may have a sensitive cervix. Not everyone feels it. Do you want the gas,\" James asked. \"No, not yet,\" Edith replied tightly. \"I think we'll get you in the chair now. It will help once they start to come out.\" Almost as soon as Edith was settled in the birthing chair another contraction came, stronger than ever. 'I definitely think they are on their way..' Edith managed to gasp out. 'Try not to push, you aren't open enough, just breathe through it for now' Helen's voice came from between Ediths knees. From that point on things started happening quickly - and Edith found the gas was necessary after half an hour. She did not cry out, but tears came from her eyes as the pain grew worse. In a haze, Edith's eye was caught briefly by a man's outline. Not James, no this was a shape she carried deep in her heart and soul, and a warmth grew over her. She was not sure though, whether this was real, it felt too hazy, too distant. Maybe it was just the gas. She drifted a little, until she heard Helen's voice cut through the fog \"Edith, when the next contraction hits you, push, hard...\" The contraction hit like a ton of bricks and she pushed as hard as she could, tears of pain squeezing from her eyes, gripping James's hand painfully as Helen crouched to catch the baby. Edith and Thomas's son emerged from his mother while it was still dark out, his hair, not dark like his father but white blond. Edith held him for a moment, until the contractions continued, helping his sister emerge fifteen minutes later with the same white blond hair. Exhausted, holding her beloved Thomas's son and daughter to her, Edith fell asleep, not noticing the tears coursing down her cheeks. To say that he was nervous was an understatement. Thomas had waited for a bit for things to calm down. Mainly for Edith to fall asleep and the two doctors to not be present. His twin children were alive. And healthy, despite everything that had had been thrown at them. Cassandra and Hector were a bit small, but from what he had been able to ascertain from conversations between Doctors Magnus and Watson, that was perfectly normal. Mr. Jordan had warned him many times to avoid running into Doctor Magnus. Whilst she could not see him, Helen was open minded enough to sense the presence of an entity, and smart enough to make a good guess as to who it was and likely mention it to Edith, or worse Alan, who would react poorly to his being around. Secrecy was key. Watching them sleep, Thomas finally felt that he had truly given something good to the world. When he caressed their cheeks, they both wriggled closer to the caress in their sleep. Before Thomas could muse any further, he heard footsteps. He could not get caught. As he shimmered out, Thomas thought, \"Please. I do not want them to suffer for my sins. The sins of the father should not fall on his children. I will do anything and everything to make sure that does not happen especially in regards to history repeating itself!\" With that, he'd faded away to the point where not even someone with Edith's gifts could see him. Thomas would be there always. And he would do whatever it took to make sure his children lived as long and happy of lives as possible. He looked at a calendar. It was October 17th, 1902. A/N 2: This turned into a monster of a chapter. My beta and I did our best with a scene that neither of us have actually experienced in reality. I would love to know what you all think. However, the birthday for public consumption will be December 17th, 1902. To lend more credence to Alan being their father. It's actually a little interlude next chapter. A character that hasn't shown up yet in the story will have it all to themselves for the most part, along with Mr. Jordan! Three guesses who it is? ;) SSD Happy Halloween everybody![Chapter 6] Interlude I: Be Careful What You Wish For... A/N: Here's the first interlude of And Then There Was Light. A character that hasn't had much to do in this story shows up in this chapter. Hope you all enjoy it! This takes place shortly after the end of chapter 5. Thank you very much Carolyn, I'm enjoying this with you! SSD Meanwhile hundreds of miles away in Northern England... There had always been some ghosts in Allerdale Hall. They had practically come with the place, if the stories were to be taken at face value. There was no one residing in Allerdale Hall. No one among the living that is, and she most definitely believed the stories. Something had been bothering her all day. Early in the morning, when it still counted as night, all of the candles in the place had spontaneously lit themselves. And the entity could not figure out why that had happened. She knew that she had not caused it to happen and she was the only ghost in the immediate area. Her traitor brother was nowhere to be found, either in the house or in the land surrounding it. The thrice blasted Americans were well out of her reach as well which irked her. She hated unfinished business. Then the ghost remembered the business with the candles again. There were two possible explanations: 1) There could be another ghost in the house. Which she found unlikely since she could sense whatever entered and left her home. or 2) A more powerful entity than she was toying with her from a distance. She conceded that the second idea was more probable than the first, since she held little power outside the house. \"Well well. I had thought that you would have figured it out by now. I was told that you had some cunning to go with that madness of yours.\" She whirled around and saw a dark haired man dressed in a white shirt and pants. He was no ghost, but something different entirely. \"What do you want,\" she snarled. The man kept his calm smile on his face as he replied, \"I was just seeing if you'd figured out the good news.\" She had a puzzled look on her face as she asked, \"How could the candles lighting up on their own signify good news or anything at all?\" \"A short time ago you were thinking about how or why they could light up on their own. Both of your theories could apply, but not this time. There is a third reason why they'd light up, and that is the one that applies here,\" the man replied. \"And what is that third reason?\" \"Oh this is going to be fun,\" Mr. Jordan thought before saying with an evil grin, \"The third reason means that a new generation has entered the world.\" He could tell that it had gotten the ghost's attention. \"That's not possible. You're lying.\" \"Actually it is entirely possible Lucille,\" Mr. Jordan said using her name for the first time in the conversation, \"They were not under your direct supervision the entire time. \"NO! Thomas would not do that to me. He was MINE! He loved me. He would not have given himself to that insipid girl, not in that way. \"I am very sorry to disabuse you, Lucille, but he would, and he did.\" Mr Jordan paused a moment to see what Lucille might do next. He thought it would be something violent, and he was not disappointed. Lucille launched herself at him, flying to his face from where she stood in the blink of an eye. Mr. Jordan didn't flinch. He didn't need to - there was nothing she could do to him physically. Or at all. As she was about to find out. Lucille was outraged to find that she made no contact with the man. He was as insubstantial, even to her rage, as she herself might be should a living mortal attempt to attack her. Again and again she lashed out at him, ineffectually. \"Come now, Lucille, you should be happy. You are an aunt. Your family line continues,\" Mr. Jordan said to the irate ghost. He knew he was baiting her a bit. \"It was meant to continue with OUR child. Thomas's and MINE!\" She was beyond reason, tears of rage and despair falling unheeded from her eyes as she hollered into his face. Lucille flew about the room whipping up a whirlwind of dust which she launched at him, as pointlessly as she had launched herself at him. \"No smile for your brother and his wife's good fortune?\" he almost felt guilty at that jibe. Emphasis on almost. \"Who are you?\" Lucille hissed into his face. \"Why have you come here to torment me with your lies?\" \"Ah, well, that may take some explaining. But I assure you, my dear, I am not lying to you. It appears your hold over your brother was neither as complete nor as permanent as you imagined,\" Mr. Jordan answered, enjoying himself. Lucille raised the cold damp logs in the fireplace to flame and hurled the flames at him. They licked around him, never quite touching him, forming themselves around him, leaving a void where he stood. Mr. Jordan decided to drive a point home with his next statement. \"Lucille, my dear, do not upset yourself so much. You have what you wanted. You never wanted to leave here. And you never will. The family line will live on... just not the way you envisaged. It is a lesson for you, though, to be careful what you wish for. You might just get it. If not in the way you anticipated.\" Lucille raged. She lifted one of the ornate heavy iron-based lamps and hurled it at the man. It didn't even make him flinch, let alone injure him. One after another, she hurled objects at him, lamps, vases, even furniture, but he withstood all of it without any sign that it even reached him. \"You know, they have their father's eyes.\" Mr Jordan could not help but throw in this information. Lucille paused in her rampage. A moment, then - \"They? There are two of them? Two of them.\" She grew calm and drew herself up. \"There is a girl and a boy. A sister and a brother.\" Her face grew wildly triumphant. \"A sister and a brother.\" Mr. Jordan had a very good idea why her mood had changed. He quickly said, \"Oh, my dear. I'm afraid you are on the wrong track there. There is a sister and a brother, it is true. But that history will not be repeating itself. Most definitely not.\" Lucille looked at him with, literally, fire in her eyes. If she could have killed him with that look, he would have been ashes in moments. Her wrath rebuilt itself, bolstered by Mr Jordan's comments. \"Leave here,\" she hissed. \"I will destroy you. Whoever you are, know that if, ... when, I discover your secret, I will send you to the deepest, darkest hell you can imagine.\" Mr Jordan sighed a little. \"Oh Lucille, many have tried. It only ends badly. It ended badly for them, and it would end badly for you. You may think there is nothing that can be done to you now you lack a physical body, but you would be horrified if you knew just how wrong you are. I promise you, any attempt to destroy me would only end in disaster. For you.\" A scream rose in Lucille's throat, her hair flew about her wildly, wind rising at her bidding to whirl around them. \"You obviously have much to think over, my dear. I will leave you to compose yourself for a while.\" He faded from view. Lucille's scream rose to an ear-splitting pitch, and the room was filled with swirling dust, debris and broken furniture, a whirlwind of hate and despair. Mr. Jordan watched and listened as the distraught ghost destroyed the contents of the room. He almost felt sorry for her. When he got back to the other side a voice called out to him saying, \"Don't you think that you were being a little harsh with her, Felix?\" He turned around and saw Rose, his immediate boss. \"I just gave her the facts. And some hard truths that I knew she wouldn't like,\" Felix replied. \"Doing that with the crazy ones is dangerous, even for you, Felix,\" Rose warned. \"Her childhood may have driven her mad, but that doesn't excuse what she did. She had enough of her mind to know the difference between right and wrong,\" Felix argued back. \"Be a bit more careful in the future, Felix. She can't get free at the moment. She would need help and she might get that help in the future,\" his boss cautioned. \"There's only one person that can help her escape, and even he wouldn't do that lightly,\" Felix mused aloud. \"He'd likely do that purely to amuse himself. Or he might just want to get his hands on her to punish her properly in his eyes,\" Rose said. \"I'd love to see what he'll come up with for her when the time comes. And amusing himself and punishing her properly are not mutually exclusive for him,\" Felix said rubbing his hands together. A/N 2: Hope you all liked Lucille's hissy fit. I picture the way she says \"Sister\" the way Darth Vader said it in Return of the Jedi. Mr. Jordan is so much fun to write. Picture his boss Rose as Betty White. Hm... who could possibly help Lucille escape at some point? I'd love to hear what you all think. The next chapter is a time jump to when Cassie and Hector are roughly 4 years old. What would be some things you'd like to see? SSD ","Summary":" Chapter I: Surprise, Surprise A/N: Sorry, this can't be helped.

Cobra Kai is life for me right now, and this is my first CK fanfic. This story begins in Episode 5, Counterbalance. Disclaimer: Do not own any characters. Chapter 1 Kirin Ichiban Present Day Daniel I never expected to have a house with more than one bathroom in my lifetime, never mind the whole master en suite deal with a jet tub. And the apothecary jars with the bath bombs and creams and stuff, but that's all her. A lotta good luxury does when the door is closed and your wife isn't lettin' you in. \"Amanda?\" I sigh into the door. \"You don't have to hide when you dye your hair, the jig is up after eighteen years...don't know why you can't just go to a salon, anyhow. We can afford more than a, a six dollar box of Miss Clairol over here. \" \"FYI?\" she calls out. \"No one under the age of eighty says 'Miss Clairol, ' and I'm taking a bath.\" \"You uh…you need any help?\" \"Keep digging, Daniel, really. Keep it up.\" \"C'maan,\" I groan, resting my head against the door. \"I apologized about the thing with Zarcharian.\" \"The thing, right. Messing with the livelihood of the common folk is a thing for you now, and mortified silence passes for an apology.\" \"Johnny Lawrence drew a di-\" \"Say 'dick on my face' again, babe, really, please say it again. I miss you saying it, it's been like a half hour.\" \"Honey, please, let me in.\" \"Maybe I should. The way you've been acting over this Cobra Kai shit lately, you'll probably try to kick down the door. You think you could?\" \"I don't know. I've never been attacked by a door.\" Ah, she knows what I did there. I can hear this woman's jaw crack when she even slightly smiles. \"When I said I wanted the old you back, I didn't mean a Miyagi's greatest hits drinking game, Daniel.\" I could kill someone in an hour from alcohol poisoning with that. \"…look, I'm sorry. I'll be in bed, readin' some self-help books. Listenin' to our song.\" \"Nice try. This isn't something you can fix with Boston.\" \"Oh, everything can be fixed with Boston, but nah, nah, not that. I meant our other song? Alexa, play 'Kryptonite?'\" Three Doors Down starts jammin' out of the sound system in the ceiling. That gets her out of the bathroom, in her robe and towel-turban. \"Remember?\" I grin. \"Huh?\" \"This is one of our songs?\" \"What. The men's room at The Smashed Grape? I thought women remembered that sort of detailed stuff.\" \"You…remember the song that was playing when we had drunk sex in a bathroom stall, but you can't retain the words 'clean the pool house' when I've said them four-hundred times?\" \"Y'know what, you're right, I'm done diggin' here. I give up.\" \"Mm-hm. Whatever. Go wax off to Kryptonite, babe.\" She goes back in the en suite and shuts the door. \"I have. Lovingly. Many times! Alexa, stop,\" I grumble, and head for the pool house. You want the Daniel you married, I'll give ya' the Daniel you married. At least he had his dignity! August 15, 2000 Cousin Louie was getting hitched, at least for the moment. It didn't end up working out, 'cause she really had his balls to the grinder. I mean, this was his bachelor party, the Italian Stallion's bachelor party…and we were on a little shuttle bus takin' us to different wineries in Napa. That was all Gretchen allowed. I mean, her name pretty much tells you everything you need to know. There's a reason nobody writes songs for Gretchens. It was Lou, me, Hanoush, Freddie Fernandez, a bunch of guys. And Mr. Miyagi, of course. Louie made sure of it. \" You bring the O.G. or else. I'll be needin' some of that Hmong wisdom before the biggest mistake of my life.\" \"Japanesse, idiot,\" I sighed. \"Eh, same difference.\" So, I was like thirty-three and never did make it to college. I was workin' my way up a dealership on the Miracle Mile. Still single as hell, but not for lack of trying. I dunno if it was the fact that I talked way too much, that I hustled PT Cruisers, or that I lived with an old guy in a room with tissue paper for walls. \"How many stops is this shitshow gonna make before we're even a little buzzed? \" Louie groaned from our seats at the back of the bus. \"I need some goggles. Who let the dogs out over here? Hel-lo!\" Hanoush goes, \"I think you're missing the fact that Gretchen is trying to get you to be more cultured? \" \"Hey, I'm cultured. I grate my own pecorino from the block, for Christ's sake. Almost cut my goddamn finger off one time.\" \"Yeah, you'll be grating your own block, alright,\" Freddie chimed in with a jerk-off hand motion. \"Welcome to the marriage club.\" \"Oh, Gahd, look at this bus, it's full of old farts! No offense, Mista M.\" Mr. Miyagi's beard was whiter then, his hair thinner, his face half hidden behind the map of Napa Valley. \"Miyagi start gray at twenty five. Offend self.\" \"So, look who's suddenly interested in the wine tour, huh?\" I chuckled at Mr. Miyagi. \"I thought you hated 'grape jelly water,' as you put it.\" \"Prefer rice wine, not ferment so sweet, hai. But, no. Planning ahead bathroom breaks. Very important, Daniel-san.\" \"Eh, Mista M, why don't I get a -san after my name?\" Louie asked. \"Signify respect,\" he sighed. \"Eh-heh, real funny. I wish I had some for myself right now, even.\" \"The hell is that, ending a sentence with 'even?' Who are you, Snagglepuss?\" I laughed. \"Yea, I'd like to snag some puss. I'm still hopin' the bus driver takes her clothes off and this wine tour is all a freakin' joke,\" Louie said. \"Nope, it's not, my friend. Cold hard reality,\" Hanoush said.\"With an earthy undertone.\" \"Look at my cousin, man,\" Louie said. \"Look at that shit-eatin' grin. He's gonna meet a girl on this trip, just you wait. He always does.\" \"And of course, their brief romance will be a valuable life lesson,\" Hanoush snorted. \"A very special episode of 90210.\" \"Hey, 90210 just ended a solid, ten year run with a bangin' series finale, I might add,\" I said. \"Aaand, that's why he's single,\" Freddie laughed. \"No wonder Candida split, huh? She came between 90210 Wednesdays for you and Mista Miyagi.\" \"Good American program,\" Mr. Miyagi said. \"Teach many lesson.\" \"Wait, wait. We're stoppin',\" Louie said. \"We're pickin' up girls, real girls. The whole Mambo numba five lineup! The hottest one has a, a sash thingy that says 'bride!'\" \"Oh, yeah, kinda like whats-her-face...\" I said, snappin' my fingers. \"Oh. Your fiancée?\" \"Will you shut the fuck up?\" he whispered. \"Forget about it, they'll never sit over here, 'cause Danny had to wear a fuckin' Winger T-shirt under his button-down.\" \"I'm wearing it ironically, OK? How is nobody getting this?\" \"Daniel-san. For once, no talk. Look.\" I don't know how Mr. Miyagi knew. He said it without even looking up from the map. He hadn't even seen the ladies getting on the bus. Ah, who am I kidding? The guy was a sage. He just knew it was my moment. She came up the steps first, and started down the aisle. In slo-mo, at least for me. H'oh my God. I heard the drum beats and those first guitar licks of that song \"Smooth\" in my head. Her hair had all these golden pieces then, and that bob cut everybody was wearing. She had on this silver dress on with a high neck, but short. She was like Miss New Millennium. \"If I'm dreaming, let me never awake,\" I found myself saying softly. There were plenty of seats and she just happened to stop at the empty one next to mine. \"Nice Winger shirt,\" she smiled. She sat next to me and folded her arms. \"Thankss,\" I sputtered. \"...I-I'm wearing it ironically. I'm the cool guy with the not-cool shirt.\" \"Mhm. Keep telling yourself that. I bet you go on Napster and 'just download their hits,' too. Like you don't have the whole CD.\" \"Wow. You always this sassy?\" \"Who under the age of eighty says 'sassy?'\" \"An old-fashioned guy. I mean, not old, old, just- an old soul. In a, uh, delightful sorta way,\" Shut up, Daniel, shut up. She held out her hand. \"Amanda.\" \"Danie- Dan. Dan the Man LaRusso,\" I sputtered, probably givin' her a Chozen handshake with my nerves. \"That's what they call me.\" \"Who? The kindergarten class you teach?\" \"Nah,\" Louie piped in from across the aisle. \"He's a car salesman, that's why every other word outta his mouth is a freakin' lie.\" \"Daniel-san perennial student,\" Mr. Miyagi offered while I shot Louie a look. \"Ookaay, guy from the Sopranos and Dalai Lama dude,\" Amanda said. \"Is this your posse, Daniel the Maniel?\" \"Yep. My cousin's bachelor party. Last gasp for your friend too, I take it?\" I asked, gesturin' over them. \"I can tell by the uh, shoulder glitter. The sparkles make your self-tanner look really natural, by the way.\" \"Ooh, you are a caution, Daniel. My grandma says that, you two would really hit it off. And believe me, this wasn't my idea of a party, but I'm not the maid of honor, so…\" \"You like wine, at least?\" \"It's alright. I'd prefer a dirty martini, ice, ice cold. Or a couple Kirin Ichibans. Or twelve.\" Now imagine being me right then, feelin' this spunky chemistry with this cool girl with sparkly shoulders, who clearly can hang, and she says she likes JAPANESE beer. I couldn't contain myself. Can you imagine an \"in\" like that? The sheer freakin' joy on my face as my mouth opened, and in two breaths I told her everything there was to know about Okinawa and the bar where I broke six blocks of ice. Yeah, she didn't believe it. I'm still not sure if she does. But she humored me, and by the end of the conversation, this peace washed over me that I'd never known before. Mr. Miyagi always said, \"Good woman for a man's soul bring calm. No agitation. No sweat or heart beating like chicken look up at ax. Only calm.\" Louie's voice somehow reached me in my paradise. \" That's it. I can't take this no more. Guys, we're bustin' outta here!\" \"This is a voluntary event, you know,\" Amanda said to Lou. \"Not a paddy wagon.\" \"Not for him. His fiancée will kill him,\" I snickered. \"She never has to know. We'll bail in Oakville, there's gotta be a little dive bar somewhere, with beer and some fuckin' food so I won't be full of gas? Mista Miyagi can get up and do karaoke, it'll be hysterical!\" \"Oh God, don't say karaoke,\" Amanda laughed. \"I'm sure Okinawa Man here knows the whole history of it, and how it translates to-\" \"Empty orchestra,\" we both said at once. I swallowed hard as we looked at each other. \"Amanda, I…I know we just met like twenty minutes ago, and I hate asking you to ditch the bride to have a few Kirin Ichibans with m-\" \"Her wedding's a sham and I hate her,\" she said quickly. \"Miyagi like Amanda-san,\" my teacher said. And the rest is history. Well, OK, that's how the story ends for our kids, but in that sweet corner of my head I remember the rest. That bar in Napa- The Smashed Grape. Laughing with Amanda 'til I aggravated every old injury I'd ever had. Mr. Miyagi ignoring the words on the karaoke screen and just singing \"dah-dee-dah-dah.\" One too many Kirin Ichibans. There was no sour, stale aftertaste when we kissed in the men's room stall. How did she end up there, you ask, well, she followed me in. I mean, I wasn't taking a shit or anything, I hadn't even unzipped. I didn't even have to go, I just needed a minute to process everything going on. To breathe. Well, so much for that. It was my mouth on Amanda's mouth, her tongue on my tongue, just this crazy makeout session from a dream. \"I don't know why, I just- I-can't let you out of my sight,\" she said. \"Please don't go away. All the good ones go away.\" \"I know,\" I said, with no other explanation other than to hold on to her like a ledge, and kiss her and wrap those long legs around me 'til we almost fell in the toilet. September 10, 2000 \"You're engaged to a twenty-one year old child?\" my mother started screechin' over the phone. \"Oh, Madonne, no! Too young, Daniel! Does she even know who Carol Burnett is? I'll be dead by the time she wants kids.\" \"Ma-\" \"Daniel, girls today would leave a car salesman the drop of a hat to get on the Reality TV and marry a millionaire.\" \"Oh, gimme a—I'm tellin' you, y-you'd better not scare this one away like you did Candida.\" \"Ucch, Candida. That isn't a name, it's a fungus! But the shoe definitely fit that little-\" \"You know what, I'm just gonna let you keep goin', Ma, 'cause I know I'm not gonna get a word in edgewise when you're on your soapbox!\" \"I stopped you from puttin' your bike in the trash, honey, of course I'm gonna stop you from puttin' your life in there.\" \"You don't understand, I've never been so attracted to anyone in all my life. On every level. Can ya' like, try to think back to when you knew Dad was the one or something, please?\" \"Antonio's been dead for twenty-five years. Do you think I remember that? I can't remember to sign a check. Attraction is all fine and dandy, but I seriously doubt that a twenty-one year old girl will be able to accept that Mr. Miyagi comes first for you.\" \"Wha- you puttin' words in my mouth, now? When have I ever said that?\" \"Well, call it the unspoken truth, then. And your girlfriends never get it. Someone who wasn't there from the beginning with Mr. Miyagi, and the Cobra Kings, and the whole ordeal is not gonna get it. That's why it's too bad that Koo-MEEKO-\" she started, stressin' the end of the name like she always did. \"That was fifteen freakin' years ago, for the love of God!\" \"Exactly my point. Could little Mandy even tie her shoes when you wanted to marry to that sweet Oriental peach?\" \"Ma, what did we say about 'Oriental?' Huh? Rugs and food, not people?\" \"What, I said peach!\" she sighed. \"Look, just forget it, OK? I know Amanda will get my relationship with Mr. Miyagi, cause she gets me.\" \"Alright,\" she said after a beat. \"You want my blessing, fine. I'll make my manicotti and she'd better eat it. Friday night dinner. And please don't wear that weird red smoking jacket with the bonsais. Save that for the wedding night, when it's too late for her.\" Update next Thursday! Thanks for reading.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Silent Water \"And you may find yourself Behind the wheel of a large automobile And you may find yourself in a beautiful house With a beautiful wife And you may ask yourself, well How did I get here?\" May 20, 2018 The day after the tournament Daniel I'm just a blob on the couch. Emotionally exhausted, and deep in another round of the allergy attack I've been having since I moved out west. My head is full of tournament brackets, some blank, some with names, branching and branching out into infinity. \"Dad…are you seriously watching Paw Patrol?\" I hear Anthony ask. I feel both my kids come and sit on either side of me, a blur in my peripherals and a slump of cushions. \"You used to force me to watch this show all the time. \"S'cuse me for gettin' a little nostalgic for Adventure Bay, I'm just catchin' up. They added a few new puppies, and I was wonderin' if Mayor Goodway finally cares about her constituents more than her pet chicken.\" \"Nope, and there are still no child labor laws,\" Sam sighs. \"Or PETA.\" \"Dad, I think you're depressed,\" Anthony says. \"Can I turn the pool house into my gaming room if you check into the Betty Ford Clinic?\" \"That's for drug rehab, you derp!\" Sam says. \"Believe me, it's not far-off to call this a tournament hangover. This whole typhoon of stuff happened so quickly…I just need to wrap my head around it all, and try to figure out where we go from here.\" Sam cringes. \"You haven't told Mom about opening the dojo yet.\" \"She's gonna freak,\" Anthony snickers. \"Guys, c'mon. I haven't told her straight up yet, but…I-I told her I was takin' Robby to Mr. Miyagi's house- she might've inferred what that meant.\" \"'That presumption sounds like a ticket to sleeping on a mat, Dad,\" Sam sighs. \"Alright, I gotta tell her, I know.\" She nods. \"So, while you're coming up with a way to break the news, check this out.\" She goes in the hope chest and takes out a few thick albums. \"Remember you told me to go through that overflowing bin of photos when you cleaned up the pool house? All in chronological order now. With a little scrapbook flair here and there, but not too much. Even Anthony helped.\" \"I put a bunch of pimp cup stickers on my preschool picture!\" \"You guys…this is amazing. You coulda just saved this for a Father's Day present.\" \"Well, you need it now to remind you that everything's gonna turn out fine.\" She's always had her mother's positive outlook, sometimes to a fault. \"You and mom will work everything out with the dojo and the dealership. If you can handle these two children of the corn, you can do anything.\" The three of us sit together, looking at the albums, laughing and talking in a way we haven't in a long time. Honeymoon pics, our first condo. The first dealership. Lots of Mr. Miyagi. Pictures of him holding our first born with \"Sammy-chan\" written in shaky handwriting. \"Do you remember him at all, Anthony?\" He was only a year old when Mr. Miyagi got sick, and three when he was lowered into the ground. \"A little. Like how Charlie remembers Rain Man. Like this cool imaginary friend.\" \"He was the real deal,\" I sigh. \"Oh my God, ultrasound pictures and everything over here. You guys look like little cannellini beans, and then aliens.\" \"There was one pic that wasn't fitting into my OCD chronology, though,\" Samantha says. \"This ultrasound. It looks like it says '2005,' but maybe it's Anthony and the '8' got smudged or something?\" And there it is, the rusted nail that still can go through me in one slam. Anytime, without warning, and I've got no defense for it. No name for it. I once thought I knew what helplessness felt like all too well, but I didn't know the half of it. I thought I'd had the shit beaten out of me, but it didn't compare to this. \"Um,\" In one fell swoop, my hand slips under the thin plastic of the album and the ultrasound is out of there, in my shaky hand. \"I-I'll ask mom later, I'm not sure. I'll leave this on my desk to ask her about, and we'll put it where it belongs.\" I get up from my sunken place on the couch and almost stumble. \"Daddy? Are you okay?\" Sam asks, shootin' up. They still add a \"Y\" to Dad when they're worried. Makes my heart swell every time, but it's killin' me right now. I hear that and I almost break and confess everything. But Amanda has always said, \"Kids don't need to be burdened with shit like that.\" \"I'm fine, sweetheart, I'm just a little overwhelmed by everything today. Tourney hangover, all these memories. Thank you guys, really, I love it, but we can look through the rest later.\" \"I'll DVR Paw Patrol,\" Anthony calls after me. I can tell by his voice he's not even raggin' on me, but serious. A sick feeling overtakes me and I don't know what to do. I tell myself to stop crumplin' the sonagram pic in my clammy fist- it's the only physical proof that this baby ever existed. Aaand there's Amanda in the master suite. \"Ohhey,\" I stutter. \"I- thought you were goin' to spin class.\" \"It got cancelled. Apparently the new teacher had a scheduling conflict with her yoga class. And guess who sublets to the yoga class- Cobra Kai. Isn't that grody?…Are you okay, babe?\" My face is a pretty open book around here, I guess. \"Fine. Just havin' an off day with everything going on, but, I-\" \"Alright, Shifty, what's in your hand?\" she squints. Her smile slowly drops as the pic passes from my hand to hers. \"…oh. Oh. Daniel, I…\" \"It, uh…ended up in that mess of pictures in the pool house, I haven't seen it in ages. But Sam and Anthony, they went through them all. You should see what a great job they did with the albums.\" She clears her throat. \"…remember how I thought I was a weird, morbid person for wanting a printout of this? God, I've seen photoshoots on Facebook with full-term stillborns in frilly little frocks. This wasn't half as cringe-worthy.\" \"Amanda…we should tell the kids. They saw how weird I acted when I saw it. I think they're plenty old enough now.\" \"Hon, let's just not go there. There's just no need to revisit this. Why, for what reason?\" \"Maybe we should. Maybe it would bring us all closer as a family. God knows we need a little help with Anthony in that department.\" \"I don't think it's a good idea,\" she says, and places the picture back in my hand. \"You and I need private business, end of story. I don't do the whole…crazy Italian emotional outpouring with the whole family, Daniel, I just can't. That's why we agreed to keep it to ourselves. Remember?\" \"Mr. Miyagi knew,\" I offer quietly. \"I didn't want him to know,\" she says, turning away with folded arms. \"Do you think I wanted anyone but you to know I was a walking hearse?\" \"Of course I told him- he went through it himself. He said the best thing I heard from anyone. He didn't say 'Oh, at least you have Samantha,\" or \"you can have another baby,' or 'it's God's will' , and all that crap everyone else did. He took my hand and he said, 'There is no word for a parent who loses a child. That's how awful the loss is.'\" \"He stole that quote from Ronald Reagan, actually,\" she snickers. \"Why do you have to have to make light of everything, huh? Laughin' on the outside, a lot of good that does . \" \"...It's just what I do, okay? Alright? Because if I talk about it seriously, I have to remember that you weren't there at the ultrasound, Daniel!\" There it is, that rusty nail in me, in one swing of the hammer. \"You weren't sitting in that dark room covered in cold goop when the tech turned the screen away from you,\" she goes on. \"You weren't listening to fucking 'Hollaback Girl' coming out of the ceiling when they told you the baby had no heartbeat. I hate that fucking song so much,\" she says, storming out of our bedroom. \"Amanda, please, don't. Wait!\" And the same way he came into the world- unexpectedly- there's our rainbow baby smack dab in front of us. \"I heard you guys fighting,\" Anthony says. \"Did Dad tell you about opening the dojo, Mom? Are you totally agro?\" What the actual fuck. \"Anthonyyy, go to your room!\" I bark. Amanda closes her eyes, trying to breathe and seethe at the same time. \"Daniel. Can we talk. Outside. \" A/N: Song lyrics and title are from \"Once in a Lifetime\" by David Byrne et al. Also, Johnny will be in this later for anyone wondering. :)[Chapter 3] Author's note: Sorry it took this chapter a few more weeks to crank out! I'm going to try to get my Miyagi-Do flow back with timely posting. Enjoy! :) September 25, 2005 Daniel Don't wake me up or ever let September end, was more like it. It was our annual training and fishing trip in Salinas, Mr. Miyagi and me. Didn't miss it for the world. Balancing on a skiff was still my favorite drill, and since I had a little more weight on me at thirty-seven, he couldn't shake me off. My kata came together without a hitch. I had magic palms, as bad as that sounds. \"Daniel-san, too much kata, not enough fish. Now time for fish.\" \"Yeah, alright,\" I said, jumping down from my horse stance on the sides of the boat. \"You're already thinkin' about lunch, huh? Must be because my Tensho up there was smoother than Jif.\" \"It good.\" \"That's it? Just good?\" \"Give you too big head, sink boat.\" Some things never changed. So, I cast my line and we sat together in the sound of the wind and the birds, the trees. Autumn out there was nothing like back east, but it was still something. \"If only Daniel-san as mindful about use bait,\" Mr. Miyagi snickered. \"Ah, shit. That would help,\" I chuckled. \"Everything is alright?\" \"Yeah, I'm just thinkin' about Amanda.\" \"Ah-ha. How is baby?\" \"Eleven weeks. We're just about to drop the news to everyone. She's actually havin' a picture of it done today, a sonogram. But, you know…you and I had our trip, so…I mean, it is what it is-\" \"Dut-dut-dut-dut, reel in,\" he said. \"We go home. You go appointment with Amanda-san.\" \"Hey, trust me, it's fine. We did all that stuff together with Samantha. Everything gets more relaxed with the second kid, you know how it is.\" \"Miyagi not know how it is with first.\" \"Oh God,\" I winced, \"I didn't-I-I'm sorry-\" \"Wife come first. Sammy-chan and New Baby, first.\" \"Mr. Miyagi…they're gonna be around for a long time. I couldn't miss this. Remember when you said your heart was empty without me? I never forgot that.\" \"That when you turn away from teaching. You never turn away from teaching when choose family.\" \"You're my family, too. Besides, we're never gonna make it back in time. She'll call me later and let me know all the deets.\" He sighed. \"What Miyagi give to see x-ray of son.\" In the time that passed after that, we were both silent. Not even sure how long it was. I saw elk in the woods crossing a rock face, the smallest one skittering way ahead until it disappeared. The Blackberry in my pocket rang. \"Hey. See?\" I told Mr. Miyagi, showing him Amanda's name on the screen. \"Told ya'. She probably just got out of the doctor's.\" I answered it. \"Hey, babe, how's it going? This kid got the LaRusso nose already?\" I'll never forget that sound. \"Daniel…\" My name was buried in a sob. I shot up to my feet. Her hysterical words barely made sense, but they stabbed through me until I heard the same sound coming out of me. I even remember saying \" Are you sure?\" like a blubbering fool . When we hung up, I didn't know if I was gonna strike my foot through the bottom of the boat or dive off and flail for the shore. My indecision sent me tripping over the side, the Blackberry sinking into the lake. I surfaced, even though I didn't want to. I clung to the side of the boat, still pouring out that sob I didn't know existed in me. Mr. Miyagi didn't even have to ask, because he knew that sound all too well. He pulled me back into the skiff and held me like a kid, and let me cry until I didn't have the strength to cry anymore. May 20, 2018 I know that being there wouldn't have changed the outcome, wouldn't have given that baby a heartbeat. But the superstitious Catholic in me has always believed otherwise. I know Amanda doesn't think that, but she still had to leave that dark room alone, and walk past all the happy pregnant women in the waiting room, alone. I was with her when our shitty insurance made us go to Planned Parenthood for the D & C procedure. We had to walk past picketers yelling at us, calling us murderers. For a wanted baby, more wanted than they could ever know. It took everything I had not to kick any of them. I see the same tenseness in Amanda's whole body as she goes out to the patio. Sometimes all it takes is for someone to call her Amanda-Lee, her full name that she hates. \"My Hesperia hyphen,\" she calls it- one of those dead giveaways of where you came from, even though it's never bothered her that I wear Newark on my sleeve. She carries all that tension in her shoulders, which I try to lay some Reiki hands on now and then, but I just don't know how to heal her. I turn to Sam and slip her a few bills. \"Take your brother to Golf n' Stuff.\" \"No, Dad, please, not there. Don't ask. Because reasons.\" \"Because reasons? You might not text in complete sentences, but you could at least talk in them.\" \"Dad...I put two and two together about everything. I was so stupid to put that picture in the album. I'm so sorry Mom lost a baby when I was little.\" I see that three-year old girl in front of me right now, and the look in her eyes when I'd say we couldn't play Little Dragon. \"Hey, hey, it's alright. It's just something that's really hard to talk about. There were no hashtags for this stuff back then. And now that the crap hit the fan about the dojo…\" I sigh, tossing my eyes the direction her brother went. \"Take him to any place with real living, breathing people, please. Mom and I need to talk.\" \"Okay,\" she says, kissing my cheek. When she starts to head to his room, she turns around. \"Tell her I want to be your junior instructor at Miyagi-Do. You won't be running it alone. Maybe that will help her come around.\" She smiles at the flash of absolute pride on my face. \"I appreciate that, kiddo, but we can afford to hire staff.\" \"Mhm. And you'll trust some non-LaRusso, Craigslist Sensei to do things your way?\" \"… Caspita, you people think you got me all figured out,\" I say with my Italian hand goin'. \"Fine, you're hired. Now your mom has the ammo that she'll never see either of us.\" She sighs. \"Good luck…oh, and I still can't believe you actually sent Anthony to his room. You were, like, Cobra Dad.\" \"Don't even.\" I go out to the patio and Amanda is sitting in the water on the pool steps, still in her tank and bicycle pants. I can't blame her. It's hot out and it's basically a bathing suit. Those round blue eyes are staring off into space. \"The…kids went out…\" I start. (Silence) \"That just cost me more than my first car.\" (Side-eye) \"I mean, not the current Kelley Blue Book, but..\" Well, I guess nothing could be a worse lead-in than that. \"…For what it's worth...I always hated that Hollaback song too,\" I offer quietly. \"And what was with Gwen Stefani havin' Japanese girls follow her around like accessories?\" \"Yeah. She totally stole your thing.\" \"C'mon, really?\" I sigh. \"Look, I gotta believe that picture ended up in our hands today for a reason.\" \"Why not, everybody said the miscarriage happened because of one.\" \"No, no, I didn't mean that like a shitty platitude, alright, I just…\" I go down the pool steps and sit half-submerged with her, taking her hand. \"I can't just drop it. It's still as raw as anything.\" \"I know…but please don't act like we never dealt with it. We did it the only way we knew how. We turned all that pain into a fire for getting our own business , worked our asses off, and gave the kids the life we didn't have.\" \"I know. But maybe all this…\" I gesture at the house. \"It's always kinda seemed like someone else's life. I'm in an Audi and it still feels like a hot station wagon, 'cause I…I think of that day, and not bein' there for you, and I can't even breathe.\" \"…babe…no. It's easy for me throw that in your face, ok?\" she sniffs. \"You were there for the other appointment. I never felt so safe before, even when that angry mob came after us. And let's face it, you could've drum-techniqued them, gotten arrested, and I could've gone to my not-an-abortion all alone.\" How does this woman make me crack a smile when we're talking about stuff like this? \"…Manda…\" \"And maybe I should've been more upset that my mother didn't come to things like my ultrasounds, because she was too busy raiding people's drawers for Percocet.\" \"I should've been there,\" I say, pulling her against me. \"Daniel, I knew from the start that you and Mr. Miyagi were a package deal. He was with us on our first date, for God's sake.\" \"That he was.\" \"And you know what?\" she says, facing me with that proud tilt of her chin. \"He never would've wanted his name to be used in a manchild dojo war.\" \"That's not what our dojo is gonna be about.\" \"Really? Because I can see things escalating to 'I have a Ninja Warrior course and you don't.'\" \"No Ninja warrior course, no one-upmanship-\" \"No sauna?\" \"Well…that would be beneficial for strai—wait, wait, I' see what you're doin' here, and I'm not fallin' for it.\" \" Knew you'd go for that.\" \"Hon...I'm doin' this for all the lost kids in the Valley who could get lured into Cobra Kai, 'cause I was almost one of them.\" \"It's not your responsibility to save them. What are you, the crazy cat lady who thinks she's gonna rescue them all? I supported you a hundred percent for training Robby. I saw the difference it made in you overnight...but a whole studio? Do you know the first thing about teaching a whole class of wild Gen-Z'ers?\" \"Well, don't you think it's about time I took a step back from the dealership?\" \"I've seen enough episodes of Bar Rescue to know how that goes. Besides, you don't even like the way people staple things. You put coasters under things in the breakroom fridge . You're going to just let go of the wheel, just like that?\" \"I'll do it. Because I trust my Ride or Die, and it's your company too. It's about time you became the new face. The new branding.\" \"Really…?\" \"Does a Larusso chew with his mouth open? You know it.I'm takin' a leap. Just like you did when you got off that bus with me.\" Her eyes are big and soft at that. \"… And when I get home too tired for the horizontal kata, and you're jumping around like a rabbit? How's that gonna work out for you?\" \"Inspiration.\" I jump up to the deck and drop down to my hands, kicking my feet skyward. I wish I'd gone to a few more spin classes, because I feel the aftermath of this in my core already. \"Today's my Two-Legged Kick day, I can feel it.\" \"Daniel!\" she barks through gritted teeth, like when Anthony's drinking liquid butter. \"No, no no, you're gonna pull your groin and I'll be stuck holding frozen peas on there, and getting a…weird craving for pasta piselli. \" \"I'm sorry, is that supposed to be discouraging?\" I grunt as I take my left hand off the deck, finger by finger. If I don't keep my legs at a perfect counterbalance, I'll be eating travertine. \"Oh, Madonne, \" she cringes through her hand. \"Babe?\" A kiai thunders out with no sound but raw exhalation, and I hit the water with both feet. I break the surface with a look of total disbelief, shaking with laughter, as she splashes over to me, throwing her arms around my neck. \"Oh my God?\" she shivers. \"You did it!\" \"Guess who's smilin' down, huh? Too bad I just pissed in the pool, though. Nah, I'm kiddin, I'm kiddin'!'\" \"I can't believe you did it, babe,\" she laughs, and it spills over into a crazy-insane kiss, panting and soaked. This is how it is. Karate is the triumph and the widow maker, the best and the bane around here all at once. The life source that makes a hell of a mess. \"I've never done it just for you before, that's why I did it. Not for my pride. Just for you.\" I cup her face and remind myself of the very first kiss. Not the one in the bathroom stall- that wasn't the first. It was when we were on the bar's dance floor, leaning heavily on each other. I don't think we were even drunk enough to be slow dancing to karaoke- that was just us . Mr. Miyagi was up there singing his own happy song, while the instrumental and lyrics for Cyndi Lauper rolled on faster than his English. I don't know how you can see fire in someone's blue eyes, but I did. Maybe it was just the reflection of the neon Coors sign, I dunno. Our heads titled so slowly into that kiss, like kids, because we must've known there'd be no turning back. \"Alexa, play 'Time After Time?'\" Amanda calls out. \"There's one outside now?\" \"Well, as much as I love lugging around your giant CD binder, it's a little easier to set the mood this way.\" \"So, you don't remember 'Kryptonite,' but you know the significance of some 'Dah-dee-dah-dah' song?\" \"Oh, it's pretty significant alright. It's when I discovered the only way to shut Daniel LaRusso up,\" she says as our lips and the music blot out the world. I wake up on our bed later, no idea what time it is in the afternoon. If the kids had any idea what's been going on, they'd never come back. Amanda's probably in the kitchen eatin' hummus straight out of the tub- that's her version of a cigarette afterwards. I pick up my phone and text her: \" Love you. When your face is on our billboards, I'll put my {eggplant emoji} on it .\" Her phone lights up and hums next to me on the nightstand. \"Huh. So good, you forgot an appendage.\" I snicker, picking it up to bring it to her. Musta been my strip tease behind the Shoji screen. There's another text, from some random number. Ill keep watch no one should see this# gotta motor And I can't help but think of who would text in haiku form with an accidental pound key. Like he had to thumb through the numbers on a flip phone to get letters. Talking like a Valley boy on a dirt bike... No. No, you're being ridiculous here. This is a wrong number. All you have to do is ask her. The same intimacy that just set fire to the pool can be applied to this. Transparency! Words! I call the number. \"...Thank you for calling Cobra Kai, I'm too busy kicking ass to answer right now. Classes are currently booked solid, but sign up for the waiting list today on W,W,W, period, cobrakai, period, c,o, m. Otherwise, speak now and have a bitchin' day.\" After the voicemail beep, the artery in my temple is like hundreds of high schoolers stomping on bleachers. A/N: Paraphrased lyrics at the beginning are from \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" by Green Day Please let me know what you think! :)[Chapter 4] Author's note: Hello! I guess I turned my clock back to a time when I was better at posting. I'm so sorry I haven't updated since June. I promise that this story has much more in store. Thank you for reading and following, and I love to hear from you guys. Your comments are so helpful and inspiring! May 20, 2018 Daniel My thumb turns white on the 'end' button. Never quite as satisfying as slamming a handset down, am I right? All I can do is let out a quivering laugh in disbelief. This guy. He disappears for decades and then keeps popping up like a Whac-a-Mole. I try to find blank space, a meditation anchor, anything to stop myself from going down this path. Keep watch? No one should see this? Dut-dut-dut, the old man in my head hesitates. Didn't you learn anything from \"there's something BIG I want to give you\" on Sam's computer? Wait. Amanda's been quietly fuming about my broken All-Valley trophy, the gold karate guy's supporting leg oozing dried glue . She wouldn't lay into Johnny about it in front of me, though. Maybe she called him up and told him off for breaking it, to which he said \" He broke it,\" to which she said \"Because you threw him into it, asshole!\" She reamed him out for his students' shitty behavior, which he's going to… keep watch for, because no one should see… someone's arm get wrenched out of its socket. Got it. Done. Right, LaRusso…as if. Even worse, there's this kid in a periwinkle tuxedo in me, rearranged and bitten, somewhere in the clammy/blah range on the arcade Love Tester. I look in the dresser mirror and that ruffled kid is staring back at me. \"You know what else she does?\" No. No, I'm not doin' this. You gonna drown your sorrows with a chocolate milk, too? Come back to 2018, dorkus. There's wi-fi and rationality here. Yeah. Rationality… I close my eyes and Amanda does a split across the hood of Johnny's orange Challenger, in a short white dress. The Whitesnake video of my nightmares. Here I go again, on my own. Oh God. You're crazy, man. Name one reason she'd ever do that to you, ever. We just fell back into the darkest part of our marriage and came up stronger. There's an old Polaroid of me on her nightstand- yeah, it's framed as a joke, but with love. I'm smiling ear-to-ear at Toe Stops roller rink, wearing the most rad crop top that East Orange had ever seen. The truth was, I'd outgrown my clothes and Ma couldn't buy more. This is Amanda's Daniel, \"who takes life's lemons and makes crop tops,\" she says. And yes, she had a lot of…alpha-male, pretty-boy, douchebag type boyfriends before I came along, but… I try not to think of Terry Silver very often, but that hyena laugh is hard to forget. \"You can just stand there and let him kick your ass!\" Still clutching Amanda's phone, I go out the mission door in our bedroom, and duck into the sycamore trees. I call Cobra Kai again. Pick up, pick up you son of a bitch. \"Thank you for calling Cob-\" \"Listen asshole, I'll keep this nice an' brief, since you probably got thirty minutes a year.\" \"Ooh, get a load of Rebel Yell LaRusso, crank calling people for the first time ever. You gonna call Kentucky Fried Chicken after this and ask if they got big breasts?\" \"No, but I'll call the Kabob place and ask if they found your nose on a skewer, after I wail it through the back of your head.\" \"Yeah, that sure sounds like self-defense. Your Sensei would be proud.\" I bite the inside of my mouth the way I do every time I have a sobering thought about Mr. Miyagi. It's probably the tenth time today alone. \"Then call it family-defense.\" \"What's your damage, man?\" \"I can't make heads or tails out of this textual diarrhea you sent Amanda, but don't do it again, you got it?\" \"Jesus, you check her phone? Big surprise. I'd be all insecure too, if I was a wastoid married to a babe with dimensions like that.\" \"Keep digging, Ex-Lax, go ahead. How did you even get her number? Cell phones aren't in the White Pages.\" \"Uh, doi- your wife called me first. She just had some girly questions about the yoga outfit that rents my place.\" \"Really.\" \"Yeah, standard-issue stuff. Is it gluten free, do they turn up the heat to a hundred and ten, do I watch, do I jack off in plain view. When I said no, she said 'Dealbreaker' and hung up,\" he snickers. \"Johnny, I swear to God-\" I think my days without needing blood pressure meds are numbered. \"You know what? I'm not doin' this. I'm not stupid enough to fall for your crap. You're tryin' to undermine my dojo before it's even off the ground. Gettin' into my head, my personal life…I won't let you.\" \"Look, LaRusso. I'm a man of simple tastes. If I wanted to undermine your damn dojo, I'd just put a bumper sticker on my car of Calvin pissing on a bonsai tree. I'll leave the straight-up psychological warfare to you and your mafia buddies, but congrats on your one and a half students.\" \"One and a half?\" \"Yeah. Robby and what, a circus midget who needs to brush up on taking falls? It'll just be the midget, soon enough. My kid will defect to Cobra Kai when he gets sick of twirling around in search of inner peace. Your karate's like a box of raisins on Halloween, man. Mark my words, Robby will bail.\" \"He wouldn't join you if you had a live death metal band and naked water girls.\" \"Welp, if there's a permit for that, I'll be able to afford it now. Cobra Kai is GOAT, which stands for Greatest of All Time. Shit, man, it's better than GOAT, 'cause cobras eat goats.\" \"Wow! You're crushing the latest lingo, Johnny, you're really listening to those kids where it counts.\" \"Whatever. Keep crawling in the snake tracks, man. Trying to be like me, copying everything I do. It'll get your wife off, at least. Give Amanda-Lee my best, craneshit.\" I know that cell phones don't clunk when someone hangs up, but there's a clunk in my head. Amanda's hyphen. Nobody knows about her hyphen. It hasn't been on a public record in twenty years. She had it legally changed the minute she moved out of the high desert. It's a detail she keeps close to her heart, mostly because of all the pain that goes with it. Why would she tell him? I go back into the house through the master suite door. I put her phone back on the nightstand just as it was. In my head, a live video of Johnny pops up on the screen at an unflattering angle. \"Hey, LaRusso, I got a new Facephone. Now I can send dick pics to your wife!\" Amanda returns from the kitchen, my back to her, and my breath dries up in my chest in a way that would make Mr. Miyagi shake his head. \"Well, that was an everything-hummus kind of afterglow, hon,\" she says, wrapping her arms around me from behind. I close my eyes, involuntarily leaning back into her embrace. Johnny's messing with your head. Go ahead. Screw up your whole life over this. That would be just like you. Her lips are searching my pulse along my neck, and I let out a low groan. I try to focus on nothing but this, but my veins are bursting with Everyone leaves you. Some way, somehow, they go. She can be this close and partly gone. She turns me around to kiss my mouth, but freezes when she sees my face. I couldn't come up with a poker face if my life depended on it. \"Babe…? Why are you looking at me like a bonsai in a tide pool…?\" \"…I-I don't know…\" \"Of course you know.\" I do, but I just start rambling. \"Wh-what if we'll never be over the miscarriage? What if things have never been the same since then and never will be? What if Miyagi-Do is a joke, it's a pipe dream and no one will stick around long enough for the punchline about the chores-\" \"Babe, whoa, whoa, please. Look at me,\" she says, one hand on my chest \"We're fine. You convinced me about the dojo. I'm still a little stuck on the time factor, but I know that kick by the pool was born out of pure passion. It's enough. You're enough.\" What are you hiding? The words are in my head, but they won't come out of my mouth. It's not usually hard to keep anything from spewing out of this trap of mine. I look into those bright blue eyes. I'm just gonna come right out and ask. \"…Do you like the gold and blue mats or the red and white?\" \"C'mon, the red. Your mats, babe, no contest.\" The doorbell cuts into the tightness in my chest. \"Wow. Whoever that is has perfect timing. If they showed up an hour ago, they would've heard the part where we almost broke the Shoji screen,\" she smiles, kissing my cheek. Yeah. Timing. I open the front door to my cousin Louie, and get a flashback of him at age seven from the guilty look on his face. \"So this is it, huh? This is how it is? You gonna throw away a lifetime of memories because of that asshole?\" he says. \"Well, I'm older than you, so it hasn't been a lifetime for me. Seems like it, though. And then some.\" \"Can ya' get serious here?\" \"Louie, you're still family. Still my cugine, alright? I just don't want you at the dealership anymore. That's all. I know this might be a weird concept for the uh, Mediterranean population, but family can still be family without permeating every facet of your life and goin' in the bathroom with you, y'know?\" \"You need me over there to run defense against Tom Cole.\" \"I can handle Cole.\" \"I heard his wife's tryin' to dig up dirt on Amanda. They wanna taint the Typhoon June Approve-a-Thon with some big scandal.\" I swallow a half-breath. \"Louie, I can't even with this right now, okay?\" \"Don't be so gabbadoste, huh? This could get ugly. Let me handle the PR end of things.\" \"Your name and 'public relations' put together are like peanut butter and mayo, for Christ's sake.\" \"Danny…I gotta tell you something' else, but promise you won't get mad.\" \"…Louie…\" \"The bikers...they're not happy with you.\" \"With me?\" \"Yeah. They think you're ungrateful for what they did. They said there should be…you know…compensation, for the favor with Snakeface's car, and how roughed up they got. They said they have ways of gettin' what's owed to them. I said to not even joke about that, like, 'Danny knows all the pressure points and shit,' but they just laughed and called you Hong Kong Phooey.\" \"So now I'm in trouble with a bunch of guys I don't even know, for something I didn't ask for? You know what? Get out. \" \"Cuz, you can't leave me hangin' on this!\" \"I won't,\" I growl, leading him over the threshold. \"Tell 'em that if they come near me or my family, I'll ram their fat heads through the front fork of their bikes. You got that?\" I slam the door behind him. I fully expect Amanda to appear and ask \"What was that all about?\" but she doesn't . Definitely not like her. I creep to the bedroom door and glance over the frame. She's texting quickly. Shakes her head at the phone and smiles. It's probably the kids. But Johnny and Amanda are in my head, and I can't get them out. My breathing quickens and I back away from the door. I go back the the living room, the high ceilings closing in on me. Mr. Miyagi, it's times like these that I can't handle you being gone. Even though I know exactly what you'd say, and the simple, soulful way you would say it, I need it from you. But, maybe my answer from him comes in a different way. The doorbell rings again, but I know it's not Louie. I feel Mr. Miyagi's calmness radiate through every plank, every nail. But I open the door, and it's Robby. \"Hey, Mr. LaRusso.\" And just like that, everything kinda settles for the moment. I've always wondered where his manners come from, but I've never asked. He's wearing a button-down shirt and khakis, and my shoulders tense at the idea that this is for Sam. \"Robby. What're you all dressed up for?\" \"I'm a little early. You asked me if I wanted to come to the thing you're sponsoring.\" \"Oh, shit-\" I wince, kneading my forehead. \"I mean, if you still want me to. You asked me to go before stuff went down, but…I thought it would be back on after yesterday and…I've never been to the Hollywood Bowl. You said it would be a lesson about balance? Piano and forte, or something?\" I completely forgot about the Philharmonic show. I'd rather roll down a hill right now, with everything else going on, but there's no way I'm ditching Robby. \"Of course. Please, come on in. Don't mind me, I screwed my schedule up. I don't usually do two sponsored events in one weekend, but it is what it is. I wouldn't miss it. There are gonna be dancers, too.\" \"You're all about the synchrony, Mr. LaRusso. Another lesson?\" \"You know it. But, is your shoulder good for sitting all that time?\" He smirks. \"I think sitting would be better than doing chores.\" He makes himself comfortable on the couch, like he's always been a fixture here. \"You'd be surprised…hey, can I ask you something?\" \"Sure.\" \"You ever feel like…what you're learnin' here is kinda…ehh.\" \"Ehh?\" he shrugs. \"Like trick or treating and getting a box of raisins?\" \"Yeah. Absolutely,\" he laughs. \"That's a good thing?\" \"Well, I'm allergic to nuts, so my mom was too paranoid to take me trick-or-treating. But if everybody had given out boxes of raisins, that would've been pretty awesome.\" This guy. He always surprises you. \"That's…a perspective I hadn't thought about.\" \"I think the better question is, is this orchestra show gonna make me want to commit Snickerside?\" \"Ey, come on. Hang on a sec.\" I see my laptop on the ottoman and open it up, skimming the info about the show. \"…Seaside Dance Troupe…international…you into dance?\" \"The cheerleaders at school, maybe. What about you, Mr. LaRusso, you into dance?\" Just like that, I remember my reflection in the window of a Panasonic store in Okinawa, the rush of right-side traffic and people, the smell of deep fried sata andagi pastries. \" Oh, you want to be a dancer?\" \" Very much,\" Kumiko said almost in a whisper, watching the ballerina's liquid movements on the color TV. \" Well, that's a great thing to be.\" \"...I was. Once,\" I say. It hits me I haven't even told Robby about pulling off the two-legged kick yet. It's lost somewhere in everything after that, and now in a Okinawan reverie as lucid as anything. I don't know if I should drag the whole family to the Philharmonic under the threat of the bikers. I don't know how balancing on one hand turned into the most stable moment of the day. TBC! ","Summary":" Hello! Cobra Kai is life for me right now, and this is my first CK fanfic. This story begins in Epi"},{"Movie":"Karate Kid","Title":"I'm Only Heading Down","Author":"Gia467","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13127765","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I'm Only Heading Down Notes: Warning: While this story does not explicitly detail sexual abuse or deal with rape (in the very definition of the word), it does deal with descriptions of non consensual ( or dubious consensual) touching. This also deals with guilt and self directed blame. I have debated posting this for quite some time mainly due to the heavy and rather dark subject matter that is extremely out of place in this particular fandom. I know there are a few stories that deal with rape and abuse as a main plot point, however this story does not contain a definitive healing with the help of either romantic or non-romantic partners. It is a story that I have tried my best to write respectfully and properly. It does not guarantee a bad ending, but it's not going to end completely wrapped up, either. I wrote this partly because some of the best novels I have read and films I have watched deal with this subject matter, and also partly due to the recent coverage of the Larry Nassar case. I felt compelled to take my chances and write something atypical. This is not meant to be a head-cannon or an explanation for Johnny's actions in Cobra Kai, it is only a story that explores the concept. This story will try and follow as closely to canon-universe as I can. Thank you for reading this authors note, and I do accept any criticism if you may have it. The main purpose of this was to write a story that I care about, and one that allows me to explore a different voice. Consider this authors note a trigger warning. I Don't Know How I Feel (and I Blame You) \"You have real potential, you shouldn't waste that.\" \"Training has made a difference on your body.\" \"You're my best student, Lawrence.\" Johnny laid on his bed, curled up with a pillow. He made sure to lock his door, he didn't need anyone walking in on him like this. Nobody was supposed to know he was even at home. Not his mother, not any of the guys, and definitely not Sid. He needed to be alone. He needed to think. He was trying not to ruminate everything for hours like he normally did, obsessing over every detail of it until he got a headache. He didn't really know at he was dealing with. Was he taking it the wrong way? Was he looking for meaning that wasn't there? He wasn't too sure of anything really. Did he even mean to? It could have been an accident, something that happens all the time. He was stretching, he needed a bit of help. It surely happens sometimes, or at least he imagines it does. Of course, when it actually happened he wasn't even sure he felt it until he tried it again. Different position this time, since he had told him to try a split but he couldn't quite go down all the way. He probably didn't realize how high his hand was. He took it away quickly anyway. \"Just try and relax.\" He tried to after that, he really did, but the second time he stiffened visibly and he couldn't help it. He wasn't used to people touching his thighs. He'd never really realized how intimate touching someone's thighs actually is. You never realize something like that until it actually happens. You just think about it, how it must be or must feel. \"Can you relax? You're tense.\" Of course he was tense. It wasn't like there was something outright wrong with it or anything so he felt stupid to be uncomfortable with it, but he didn't like the idea of someone's hand in that particular place, so far up his leg. Just one little inch more and– He shook his head, trying to stop that thought in its tracks. He was way over thinking it now. It wasn't like that. What the fuck would he even have to do with him like that? He's not like that. He wanted to help. It's a one-off, a slip-up. After all, you're the favourite and everyone knows it. Special treatment just for you. The sudden feeling in his chest had Johnny squeezing the pillow in his arms, nuzzling his face in it until he couldn't see anything else. He wanted to be held; he didn't know why the urge is so strong but he wants it. Could he call someone over? Ali wanted nothing to do with him anymore and he couldn't blame her. Clearly, physical intimacy wasn't an option. He thinks for a moment that maybe Bobby would come over if he asked him to. Maybe he could talk to him about it, get this out of his own head. Reluctantly, he crawled from his bed and dialed one of the only numbers that he'd bothered to learn by heart. My Throat is Sore Today he asked him to stay behind after class. Bobby gave him a questioning look that bordered on concern. He told him just to wait for him, he knew he would. He was wary of everything now, much too on edge for Johnny's liking. When he had told him, Bobby was adamant about reporting him to the cops or something, but that was quickly refused. They could take care of it themselves. When he steps into his office, he's standing there looking him over. He becomes fidgety under his gaze. \"Take that off for a minute.\" Johnny's voice is unsteady. \"Take what off?\" \"The gi.\" The blonde gapes slightly. But he didn't have anything on underneath– \"C'mon, I don't have all day. Strip, off.\" He says it so casually like he's not asking him to take off his clothes in front of him. Against his usual instinct, the blonde hesitates more. \"Why, sensei?\" He's never really asked him to do this before. \"Because I asked you to.\" There's a finality there, a little menacing and Johnny can feel his throat tighten up, choking out any chance of a retort. \"I'm checking you over, I can't do that with your clothes on. That was a rough spar today, your parents wouldn't be very happy if I sent you home with fractures would they, Mr. Lawrence?\" There is no no. He says nothing and nods. Taking a little deep breath he begins to disrobe, taking off the top first in hopes he can get away with one piece at a time. No such luck. \"All of it. It'll be faster if I can check you all at once.\" Slowly, Johnny complies. With no clothes on but his underwear, which were now deemed greatly unfavorable due to the natural tightness of them, Johnny's skin breaks into little goosebumps. He's fidgety again, gnawing at the inside of his mouth as hands once again make contact with his skin. Over his ribs, his spine, over his chest, where a noticeable change in pressure is felt, and he can't help but make a little sound in his throat, recoiling slightly at the intrusiveness. For a second he stops. \"Does that hurt?\" \"No.\" He hates the way his voice sounds, and he's sure that the tone makes it all the more clear the effect that this has on him. It's like admitting weakness without saying it. He's sure he doesn't have to even say anything, why else would this be happening anyway if he hadn't picked up on it first? Isn't this how it starts? Fingertips press into his ribs, then stop just short of the dips below his hip bones. His eyes close as his face is handled, feeling much too shy to look his sensei directly in the eyes. For a few moments, there is an ugly, contemplative silence and Johnny's eyes don't open until he hears him speak again. \"Good, you look good,\"It's a bit low, husky even. Standing there in his tight underwear, he looks good . He can feel his eyes watering, heart beating so fast he's half afraid he'll tear an artery. Johnny doesn't bother to say anything back. Without even leaving the room he pulls on his clothes; he figured leaving the room just to cover up would look absurd. He stands there, waiting to be dismissed, and once he's given permission to leave he practically darts out of the building, Bobby hurriedly by his side and asking all sorts of questions in a worried jumble of speech. He only makes it a few steps before he notices himself start to drool, and Bobby has to jump back to keep from getting vomit on his shoes. What Have You Done? He paces in his room, back and forth. He's upset and conflicted. Why him? Why this? He trusted him. He liked him. Now he can barely stand to be there anymore. The one thing he was enjoying in his life right now, and even that was tainted. How could he act like nothing had changed? It makes it even worse, knowing that he's not affected at all by his constant near-tears state every time he's near him for too long. He was somewhat jumpy now and often flinched a little when people tried to touch him unexpected. He visibly tensed up whenever he walked near him. Warm-ups were nerve-wracking, and yet he still had the audacity to criticize him for his lack of focus. He seethes. Go fuck yourself, you're absolutely sick. Pacing doesn't work that well in such a limited space, and he nearly knocks into his bed. How could he? He hates him, he really does. A little voice pipes up: but you keep going back there. What happens now is your fault. For the third night that week, Johnny can't sleep. Eventually the room gets brighter, the house gets noisier, and his mother, very sweetly calls him downstairs for breakfast. He just hopes he doesn't look as tired as he feels. Of course, Laura is quick to notice he's off. She's always quick to notice every single thing that is wrong or could be wrong. Usually he's grateful for not having to vocalize everything that he needs, to just have someone that can tell just by looking at him or because he's acting differently, but today he wishes she wasn't so sharp and she just left for work without saying anything, leaving him to languish in peace. \"Sweetie you look tired... didn't you sleep last night?\" \"Yeah uh, I guess I just stayed up too late.\" He yawns, because of course his body betrays him at every opportunity. She isn't fooled. \"You don't look so good,\" Her hand goes to his forehead, \"I hope you're not getting sick or anything...\" He looks around for Sid but it doesn't seem like he is gracing him with his presence today. He'd know if he were downstairs, the minute his mother suggested he was sick, oh he'd definitely fucking know by now. He tries to quell her worrying. \"I'm fine, really. I just slept badly I guess.\" She affectionately scratches his head, \"Do you wanna stay home?\" He considers it for a second. But then again, where would that leave him? Alone in his room to think about it all day? No thank you. He'd take droning through useless lectures and his friends' antics before he did that for another 12 hours straight. \"No thank-you. It'll probably go away once I'm doing something.\" All the better to distract himself with. She looks hesitant, but smiles anyway. \"If you say so. But, if you change your mind, I have a break from noon until 1 so I could pick you up and drop you back home if you don't feel up to the whole day.\" Lying to her almost hurts more when she's this concerned, and all she thinks is that he got a night of bad sleep. Oh good god, he couldn't tell her, ever. This was too much to make her deal with. He tries to smile but he knows it doesn't come out right. \"Thanks, mom.\" Easier With Friends Sleeping at home is hard. Bobby at least comforts him enough that he can manage a few hours uninterrupted. With one arm slung over his ribs, the other rested on the pillow just above his head. He was starting to get sleepy like this. \"You're okay, Johnny.\" He says it to him like he was afraid his voice might scare him away, might make him dart and run like a deer whenever you move too quick or too loud. They're close, but not touching. \"It's okay.\" Johnny blinked slowly, mentally tallying the events of the past 16 or so hours. He didn't flinch when Tommy hugged him and he didn't stay behind when asked either. He knew he'd get chewed out for that later but for now, it was a small victory at the very least. At that point though he wanted to just sleep a little. It had been a while since he'd slept through a full night and he was physically and mentally exhausted. Johnny finally acknowledges his statement, slightly raspy voice being muffled by his place on the pillow. \"I'm okay... \" He says, agreeing and his voice quiet. He breathes in deeply, quietly. It's easy to sleep like this. He desperately hoped he didn't leave, he likes this, whatever it is. He lets his gaze drag up from Bobby's stomach to his face, and sees that his eyes are closed. He figures he must be tired lately. A pang of guilt hits him. He's tired from staying up with you, taking care of you. Always being over here for hours on end. You did this because you opened your stupid mouth. And now- \"Hey.\" He looks at Bobby again, grey eyes open and looking at him with intent. \"Try not to think too much, okay? Just try to get some sleep. I'll be here when you wake up, so don't worry. I'll be here. I won't leave until you want me to.\" He never wants him to. Just stay forever. Johnny's eyes are heavy, drastically edging towards sleep, the adrenaline rush long having passed as soon as Bobby had pulled him into the car and driven him to his house. He lets his eyes close again, and this time he feels a touch on his head, a very gentle stroke to his hair. \"I'll protect you, I promise.\" In Your Hands Now Class is going well for once. He isn't bugging him or standing near him too long, it's like he's just another student. He still asks him to lead the class in exercises. Routine jab-punch procedures. For a moment things feel normal. After class however, is not. It's not even directed at him but he can't help the anxiety that hits him like a freight train. The fact that it's meant for someone else might even make it worse. Actually, there's no question, it's undoubtedly worse. A friendly touch to some guys shoulder, innocent enough that he'd think nothing of it unless he already knew. By then you're in too deep. Maybe someone else wouldn't be as much of a coward as he was and speak up, to end this whole thing and be stronger than he ever could be, but he still doesn't say anything even after class. He watches him leave to the changing room to get dressed and doesn't say a word to him. He doesn't even wait for Bobby, he doesn't even change out of his uniform and he probably looks absolutely ridiculous with a bag full of stuff, walking haphazardly across the busy street barefoot to his mother's car. Sid takes one look at him, clear exasperation on his face like he's already tired of him, and drives him home without a word. He sprints upstairs to his room and into his closet where the door is closed abruptly, taking a handful of sweater sleeves to his mouth, he's already hyperventilating, breathing so hard he's afraid he might pass out. The clothes easily muffle the majority of the sound that comes pouring from his mouth so aggressively that he can feel it scratch the inside of his throat. Eyes still closed, he breathes in deeply, in and out once. His thoughts are muddled and coming all at once. You can't go on like this.[Chapter 2] Now What? Bobby made good on that promise whenever he could, but he couldn't be with him all the time. He knew that. He just wished it didn't have to get worse. Johnny stumbled his way to Bobby's house, past his confused mother, collapsing on the floor of his bedroom and crying the minute Bobby shut the door. He managed to mumble out the details, as he watched Bobby's expression turn from hyper-aware concern to barely contained anger. Bobby didn't know what else to do, except sit on the floor with him and hold him as he cried. He just prayed his mom wouldn't come knocking on his door asking what the hell was wrong with Johnny. What would he even say? Johnny's grip on him is tight and desperate. \"Shh, shh, shh. You're okay, you're okay now, it's over now.\" God, what should he even say to this? Clearly it was not okay, very very not okay, and they should've reported this shit like he suggested and this might not have happened. People take this shit seriously don't they? But it was too late for suggestions in hindsight. Not to mention, it would have probably made him feel even worse. Johnny had never felt more useless. He tried to stop it, he really did, but he couldn't. He was much too emotional and weak for his own good, no wonder people got so fed up with him when all he did lately was cry. Bobby just stroked his hair and let him curl around him, hands wrapped around his shoulders and face buried in his neck as he attempted to comfort him. \"Shh... \" Running a hand up and down his back, Bobby could feel him shaking slightly. The blonde sniffled, slipped from his grasp, and stiffly laid himself down in his immediate position on Bobby's bedroom floor. He tried to get him up, to no avail. \"C'mon, you can lay down in bed,\" He couldn't just lay on the floor. Except Johnny wasn't moving, at all. Bobby knew that he was likely going to remain in that state for a few hours and was left with no other option than to try and comfort him from his position on the floor. If he tried to lift him up, he might start panicking. He was trying to avoid a full-blown meltdown. Johnny breathed shallowly in and out, shoulder pressed between the wall and Bobby's leg, while he felt him try and lift his head from the ground and place it on his lap. He just hoped that his crying wasn't as loud as it sounded in his own head. Back to Start \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" My eyes dart up from my plate. The biting accusation is like a slap to the face. \"Nothing,\" I say. My voice is flat, like every time I have to entertain whatever shit he drudges up. \"Then sit up and eat what your mother cooked, for Christ's sake. Stop looking mopey, nobody likes that shit.\" \"Sid, please, maybe he's not feeling well–\" \"Can you stop making excuses for him all the time Laura? I mean look at him, he's too fragile you're gonna turn him into some kind of faggot–\" \"Sid!\" They're just talking over each other now. It's like he needs to start arguments. I go to touch my neck and remember that I left my headphones in my bag, despite my Walkman being on me still. \"He can't even look at people when he talks to them! You've got no respect, look at me when I'm talking to you, you little brat.\" Can he just fuck off? He's so loud, so intrusive. Why does he even care if I'm eating or not? Or does he just like to interrogate me, like usual it's just to make things harder for me– \"Johnny, sweetie?\" She says it like she's afraid I'll run away. I'm a deer in the woods again, skittish and easily startled, one wrong move and I'll dash out the door. Fuck this. \"Are you not feeling well? You don't have to eat if you don't want to.\" Her voice is soft. It's nice. You should eat. You're physically hungry. \"No, I'm okay, really.\" I smile, trying to ease her worries. It works thank god, and she continues eating. Sid doesn't say anything else for a while. I find my voice again. \"Mom?\" She looks hopeful. If Sid wasn't there, maybe I'd say something. I want to. \"Is it alright if I go see Bobby after dinner? We're gonna see a movie.\" Is it convincing? She looks happy now, relieved even. \"Yeah, of course you can. Just don't be home too late, okay? You've got school tomorrow.\" She cares about you, can't you see? Just say something... ANYTHING. You can get her alone after dinner and spill your secrets. \"Yeah, okay.\" If a murderer always returns to the scene of the crime, then what does that make me? Am I a masochist for staying here? For coming here and trying to figure out a reasonable explanation? I get that anxious, adrenaline-fueled feeling in my chest like when you shake a bottle of coke without removing the cap and it all bubbles up at once. There's no explosion, no bubbling over just as long as the lid is on; it just dissipates inside. I can feel my heartbeat but it doesn't feel fast, just heavy. Memories bubble up. I talk to myself in my head like there's another me. 'You should tell her, she cares about you and she deserves to know what's been happening these past few months.' (She's already stressed, she doesn't need that.) 'She's going to find out eventually.' (Not if everyone keeps their mouth shut.) 'What about others? There's got to be others. You saw one with your own eyes. Don't you want to help?' (Stop blaming me!) 'You have an obligation.' (Fuck your obligation.) 'You must' (Someone else will speak up. Someone who isn't weak. I just need to be quiet, avoid involving anyone else.) 'And how's that working for you so far?' I feel dizzy so I sit down, eventually I lie down. The ground is hard and inflexible but I don't mind at all. I try to seek out the stars. Some nights they're visible but other's you can't see them at all. I've lived in California all my life and I still hate the smog and the people. The sun is nice and so are the girls, but there are too many people and the city is too loud. Why does everyone come here of all places, surely there's somewhere else to be that's better than this. I take a deep breath through my nose and breath out my mouth, like they use to teach us in school if we were panicking about something. I like to count the stars, the constellations and the trees and feel the grass, but there's too much around to enjoy it often enough. I figure that maybe I'll move up the country when I get older, but I always end up worrying about leaving here, about being lonely. I don't like thinking about the future too much; it's too ambiguous. There's no worse feeling than ambiguity except maybe the idea that you know things are going to get worse. Come to think of it, I don't know if that's better or worse than not knowing. I thought it was going to be a good year, but I was wrong. It's so quiet and I'm so relaxed for once that I end up falling asleep right there in the grass. By the time I wake up, Orion has skittered to the left. Are you hiding from me now? It's quiet at home. I figure everyone's asleep already but when I walk in she's still at the table, drinking something from a large mug and reading a book. It's late, what is she doing up? Maybe she was waiting for you. Quietly, I pad into the kitchen. \"Hi, mom. What are you still doing up?\" I try to sound amused rather than concerned. \"Oh, I was just reading. Listen, I wanted to talk to you for a second, but uh,\" She's looking me over, I can tell, trying to gauge something, anything. I can't blame her for trying. \"If you're too tired we can talk tomorrow.\" I shake my head \"No, no, I-I'm not tired.\" I sit down across the table from her. Somehow sitting next to her was too much right now. \"What did you wanna talk about?\" Do I look as nervous as I feel? She pauses for a moment and in that time I feel like she somehow knows, like she can tell just by looking at me. It's a daunting thought but somehow that would still be easier than saying it. Nothing is worse than saying it. You could write it down. Just write it down and pass it to her like a note. Or maybe you could write it to her in a letter and mail it to your own house. A two-line letter just to say 'hey, your son is being felt up by a grown man.' \"You can always talk to me, about anything you know. I'm here if you need me.\" Just tell her, just get it over with. She'll understand. My head plays an internal back and forth, but I still can't say it. \"I know.\" She doesn't look satisfied. \"Are you sure everything is okay?\" She goes to brush the bangs off my forehead and my first instinct is to flinch but I fight it back. \"You just... seem a little off lately. I just want to make sure everything's okay with you. I know he's not the easiest to live with... but he's just a hot-head. Try not to let him get to you, okay? You're wonderful, you shouldn't listen to him. It's a good situation we've got here, you have everything you'll ever need.\" She looks tired, stressed maybe. She takes on all this responsibility. I can't tell her now, it'll ruin her. I can't give that stress to her, she's got more than enough already. \"Everything's fine, really. I've just had a rough week is all. It's nothing serious, I promise.\" I don't know if she believes me, but she lets me go to bed after that. I still feel like being outside since the night is clear and warm. I wrap myself in the blankets from my bed and crawl out my window to sit on the roof. The moon is there to greet me tonight. It's so bright it almost drowns out the stars. I almost want to sleep here instead of in bed, but I'm afraid I'd roll right off the roof. I crack a smile at my own lame sentiment. How long until I can stop thinking about this? Are there directions on how to manipulate your own memories? If muscle memory fades over time, will this? If I don't think about it, will I forget it completely until I can't even remember what he looks like? Guilt Cake Eventually, Bobby was over every day, having slept over most nights in Johnny's bed. His absence from home was noticed but not pressed enough by his parents to stop visiting. The sleepovers became routine, much to Sid's disapproval, and Bobby got accustomed to waking up next to someone else. Occasionally he'd have a nightmare, but holding him seemed to help. Bobby didn't mind and tried his best to ignore the tugging feeling in his chest as Johnny slept curled into him, soft blonde hair smooshed against his chin. Lounging on Johnny's parent's sectional couch, a blanket draped over Johnny and half over Bobby, the blonde pressed into his side and a bowl of popcorn between them. They had decided on Friday the 13th Part III, having a mutual craving for cheesy horror, blood and gore. Bobby's attention was only half concentrated on the movie though, with his concern for Johnny slowly seeping into the forefront of his thoughts. It had been a whole two weeks since the biggest incident, and he was painfully bitter about it. You had one goddamn job, and you failed. You failed and now he's a fucking mess all the more. He closed his eyes, sighing. You PROMISED him, and now what? His grip on the blanket tightened. He hated thinking about it but the more he pushed it down the more it decided to come back up. It was useless. Trying to imagine Johnny in that place, in that situation... Was it sudden, or gradual? Slow enough to trick him into thinking it was an accident but continuing long enough to make it clear that it wasn't? Did he struggle or stay still? Oh god, somehow it made it worse to think he didn't even try to stop it. He couldn't stand it. A sudden weight on his shoulder pulled him out of his thoughts. Turning his head, his nose met soft hair. Johnny's head was on his shoulder. Is he asleep? He spoke his name, softly but loud enough that he'd hear him if he was. No stirring. Again. Still nothing, and Bobby let out a breath, turning his head back toward the screen. He could feel him breathing, tiny puffs against his neck, and he twitched involuntarily. He closed his eyes again for a moment and swallowed before looking over at his friend, arm going to rest across his shoulders. He just wants to hold him. Guilt stuck to his thoughts. Why couldn't we have just left? I should have convinced him to join another even if I had to drag him there. Cobra-fucking-Kai was not the only option they had. I didn't think it would get this far. I thought it would stop and we could forget about it and never return after the tournament. Please, please forgive me. I just didn't know what to do. (sigh). Keeping it from everyone else was difficult. Tommy snagged him after class one day, dragging him to the back of the change rooms after everyone was out of earshot. \"What's up with Johnny? \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean like, is something wrong?\" He shook his head, he didn't want to have to have this conversation right now, not after last night. \"It's nothing.\" However, Tommy was unexpectedly persistent. \"It doesn't seem like nothing. Didn't you see him today? Somethings up, I can tell.\" Bobby fiddled with his belt, looking at his bare feet. \"How would I know?\" \"I just figured, since you guys have been hanging off each other lately. Nobody's telling me jack shit.\" Bobby's temper flared. \"I'm sorry, but how is that my problem? We're just spending more time together, that's it. Nothing's happening. I wasn't aware I needed an explanation for spending time with him–\" \"Hey hey,\" Tommy's hands go up. \"I'm not accusing you of anything I just... thought I'd ask.\" He sounds tired. Bobby eyes him again, Tommy's expression betraying his surprise at his outburst. \"I'd just appreciate being in on whatever's happening here. He could talk to the rest of us too, you know.\" His expression is nothing short of indignant. Bobby held back a bitter laugh. 'If only.' He thought for a second, whether or not telling the rest of them would be a good idea or a bad one. His instincts chose the latter. \"He's just been fighting with his dad. He'll get over it eventually. He's just been in a mood.\" He looks at him again. Seeing Tommy's genuine concern made guilt well up in his stomach. He didn't want to lie to him but, really, what choice did he have? He nodded in acknowledgement, but Bobby could sense the bitterness of being left in the dark. Johnny was his friend too, and all he wanted to do was help. Dutch's voice startled them both. \"Are you homos done gabbing? If you don't mind I'd like to get to the movie sometime today, okay?\" He's smirking at the two of them. His body jerked suddenly. Looking over at Johnny still huddled up on his shoulder, he was glad to find the sudden movement had not woken him up.[Chapter 3] Notes: I want to say a big thank you to the few people who have chosen to read this. It means the world. I have chosen a bit of a tone break from this chapter, it will be lighter than usual. I figured we (and they) could use it. Differences / Changes I can't keep having the same conversations I look to the floor to keep concentration Focused hard on every single word My nails are dug deep, and my stomach hurts .. Waiting outside the dojo, Johnny is slightly on edge with the amount of attention Tommy had been paying him these past few minutes. Was it that obvious to everyone just how bad it's gotten? He absentmindedly toyed with his bag. \"Johnny man, you uh, look a little rough,\" Jimmy was looking him over curiously. \"This new or something?\" He doesn't even look up. \"No… just didn't have much time this morning.\" That piques Tommy's interest. Usually, he's done up with cologne and fresh clothes and styled hair, even for class. Appearance was a pretty big deal for Johnny, though he hardly needed to try hard to look pretty, here he is, looking like he'd been sleeping in those clothes for a few days. He tries to lighten the mood. \"Tryin' to keep the girls away? Too much for you to keep up?\" \"Naw,\" Jimmy pipes up again. \"He's trying to snag himself a punk chick, aren't ya buddy? They're gonna go crazy over that hair of yours.\" He reaches out to ruffle Johnny's mess of feathered hair, but Johnny blocks the attempt like it was an intended kick to the face. \"Hey, easy man.\" Jimmy barely ducks the shot. A too-loud laugh from Tommy in his direction and Johnny's eyes nearly touch his brain. Tommy continues, oblivious. \"Well, you've been in a mood lately, how about after this we grab a few drinks? It's been a while since I've seen you go out- Ow, Bobby what?\" He's met with a glare and a slap to the shoulder. \"Relax would ya? I'm just teasing him.\" There's a slight edge there, the idea of yet another thing that Bobby is preventing him from doing for one reason or another, is not settling well. Johnny sighs heavily. \"Fine. If everyone will stop acting like this, I'll go.\" He thought about those implications for a moment. He'd have to be somewhat careful about not accidentally spill any potentially risky information. That would be hard to explain away the next morning. Dutch rolls his eyes, throwing the blonde a look behind his back. He wasn't sure what was going on here but he wasn't too pleased about it. What was wrong with Bobby and him lately? Johnny had been a damper for a while and didn't show any signs of letting up. He can't quite chalk up the effort to feign concern like the others did. With the tournament just around the corner, he has more important things to deal with anyway. Soon Kreese comes to unlock the door to the dojo and let in the students that were starting to congregate by the front windows. When Dutch sees Johnny hesitate while Kreese is still partially holding the door, he is quick to step ahead of him and enter without waiting for him. He can't afford to linger behind. If Johnny wasn't going to step up, then he would. It had been a long time coming. That rain cloud that follows me Looks like the one that follows you, And the same ghosts that keep me awake Haunt your nights just the same. .. \"Brew time, perk up man!\" Tommy, overly excited as always, pats Johnny on the shoulder as he passes by him. He's still busy by his locker as he watches his friend walk with just a little more enthusiasm than normal out of the changerooms. \"We'll be outside, so hurry up. We got some catching up to do.\" Johnny nods. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees that familiar dirty blonde hair. Now out of earshot from the others, they were alone to talk. Bobby hesitates; for some reason it felt wrong to look at him as he changed out of his gi like he was violating his space, adding to his vulnerability even more. The bruises on his ribs and thighs made him feel sick. \"Are you alright?\" He doesn't even look at him. \"As good as I can be.\" \"Johnny…\" He turns to look at him, expectant. \"Yes?\" That look is almost discourteous. Bobby approaches him now, ducking and getting in between him and his open locker. \"Why are you doing this?\" \"Doing what?\" \"You look like you just rolled out of bed.\" His lips almost form a sneer, \"What do I have to look nice for? It's class.\" \"You liked to look nice before.\" \"Well, what would I want to do that for? Can't risk tempting him can I?\" Bobby feels like his stomach is in his throat. \"Johnny…\" \"What? It's true. The better I look, the more I'm flaunting it, right ? Why would I want to wear cologne anyway, so he can tell me how nice I smell while he ' helps me stretch' ?\" Bobby swallows. He doesn't know what to say to that. He can acknowledge the truth in that. That's partially why Johnny stopped wearing cologne so often. The blonde lowers his head, \"Sorry...\" There's remorse there. Bobby had been a loyal and silent friend for these past few months, good to his promise and protective as ever. \"No, don't say sorry, I should've just dropped it…\" \"Not your fault.\" For just a moment both boys look at each other in silence, Bobby taking in those blue eyes he liked to look at a little too much. The circles under them were darker and they just looked tired, without that little spark that brightened them even more, the kind that tended to happen whenever he got excited. But those situations had become fewer and further in between. Bobby's throat gets a painful, restrictive feeling that he has to swallow down before he speaks to him again. He forces himself to smile a little only to perhaps get his mood up even the smallest bit. \"Why don't you come over for dinner tomorrow? My mom is gonna make that chicken you've always liked... and I know she'd love it if you came over. She's been asking about you, probably wondering why we never come here as much as I'm over your place...\" That spark is back. The tiniest bit, enough for him to notice at least, and Bobby finds his innocence, as if his favourite food and parental mentions can still get him excited, both disheartening and endearing. It was easier to think of Johnny as someone who was too jaded to become excited over such small things, as teenagers normally are by this age and the excitement over small things was gone and done with by the time they had grown up. He wouldn't have as much innocence and naivety, wouldn't be a kid that was ruined by someone sick. Somehow it's worse to think that he was this innocent thing that Kreese had effectively destroyed with all he had done. It was harder to think of Johnny as a kid, the implications of it all were heavy enough with them being just shy of eighteen. He smiles sweetly. \"Can't say no to her, can I?\" (Nights Out) I admit I'm scared So fragile, emotionally impaired (Hopeless!) Damaged goods .. Opting to check out early and head home, Bobby was now in charge of keeping Johnny from tripping over his own feet as they walked up to his driveway. He'd driven home only because, unlike Johnny, he hadn't downed his body weight in liquor within the first hour, upon the encouragement of both Tommy and Jimmy, those idiots. It was a Friday and school wasn't an issue, but he wasn't about to let his guard down that much, he had a feeling he would've surely regretted any more than the few he'd already had. Two drinks had been enough now he had more than himself to tend to. \"C'mon… don't trip, inside Johnny…\" An incoherent sound. Bobby shuts the door behind them, mindful that it was well over 12 in the night and his parents would be asleep by now. He didn't even think Johnny would drink, nevermind drink as much as he did in those few hours. It's a miracle he hadn't thrown up yet like he usually did when he decided to drink that much. He just prayed he'd hold out if he did feel sick. If you're gonna puke, wait until we get to my room and there's an entire floor separating you from my parents. \"I guess you had fun tonight?\" \"Mhmm.\" He's leaning on him so heavily that for a second Bobby has to reconsider the way he walks up the stairs. He manages to get to his room, where Johnny decidedly flops down on his bed, taking an immediate liking to one of Bobby's numerous throw pillows. \"Why do you have so many pillows, Bobby?\" Bobby glances over at him, studying one held arm's length above his face. He drops it. \"Ah.\" \"Please tell me if you're going to be sick.\" \"M'not.\" He shifts his attention to his dresser, getting out pyjamas for him and Johnny. He hated sleeping in his clothes and figured Johnny may want to change out of the shirt he spilled a drink on. He quickly sheds his jeans and coat, swapping them for a pair of joggers and a soft t-shirt. He glances at Johnny, still on the bed but had since removed the pillow from his face, laying sideways and facing him now. Bobby approaches him, but Johnny is still drunk enough that his line of vision doesn't quite meet his face. He looks up at him. \"Did I do something bad?\" Bobby is confused but answers anyway. \"No? Why would-\" \"I didn't say anything tonight, did I?\" Oh, is that what he meant. He shakes his head. \"No, no you didn't say anything.\" He blinks slowly, alcohol appearing to lose some of its effects. \"Oh, good.\" \"Are you tired, wanna sleep?\" \"No…\" \"Wanna talk?\" He reaches for a pillow again, \"Yeah.\" \"About?\" He shrugs. \"Anything.\" \"Can I ask you something?\" There was that nagging question at the back of his mind, and he figured this was a good enough opportunity as ever. \"Uh-huh.\" \"Are you going to participate in the tournament this year?\" Bobby doesn't turn to look at him, but in his peripheral can see Johnny's brows disappear under his bangs for a few seconds. \"Yeah, why wouldn't I? Can't let that little brat think I pussied out. Besides, it's the last year I can enter… might as well try. You can't knock yourself down before you even get in the ring, you know.\" The slurring is mostly out of his voice now, but he can tell he's still fairly buzzed. Bobby internally winces, his mood had dampened visibly. \"Sorry, just curious.\" That word was becoming a frequent exchange between the two of them. \"You have to stop saying sorry so much.\" \"... Sorry.\" It's said very tongue in cheek, and this time Johnny turns to face him. They're close again now, and Bobby stares at the light freckles that dust the bridge of his nose. \"Can I have some water?\" Bobby blinks quickly. \"Yeah, just... wait here, don't move.\" Johnny turns onto his back again, facing up at the ceiling, a pillow partially covering the lower half of his face. Bobby pads downstairs to the kitchen, trying to be as silent as possible while running the sink and ascending back up the stairs. Johnny is still where he left him. \"Sit up.\" The blonde slowly rises, scooting towards the end of the bed as Bobby hands him his glass. \"Sip it slowly. If you drink it too fast you'll make yourself sick.\" Surprisingly, Johnny follows his order. He sits with him now. \"How do you feel?\" \"Stupid.\" Bobby's brows furrow. \"Why?\" He slumps, \"Because.\" Silence for a moment. \"I don't want everyone thinking something is wrong with me…\" \"They don't .\" Johnny pouts. \"Yeah, they do. You heard Tommy today. He thinks something's up. He knows, I bet.\" \"I promise you, he doesn't.\" \"I don't know how to act normally, and now everyone's on my case.\" \"They're just worried, Johnny.\" Bobby isn't sure how to approach this with Johnny being slightly intoxicated, or whether or not a suggestion to tell someone else would even be a good idea to bring up now. \"They care about you.\" \"Except for Dutch… he's mad at me, I don't know why.\" Dutch is another story. He's always been a bit off, been a bit different in his opinion of Johnny than the rest of them had, but everyone chalked it up to competitiveness. He was too intense for Bobby's liking. Bobby took the opportunity to lie down on his side of the bed while Johnny was sitting cross-legged. \"I wouldn't worry too much about him, he's probably just in a mood, you know him, more emotional than a girl.\" His voice takes on a monotonous quality to it, a product of tiredness and partial exasperation. That last part makes Johnny laugh. \"You're right, you're so right...\" More quiet giggling. He faces him now, slumping down on the bed again, \"Wanna stay up the whole night? We haven't done that for a while now.\" Bobby shrugs. \"Sure… but what are we doing?\" He was getting a tad sleepy, the kind that happens from just laying down somewhere comfy, and something would have to keep his attention for the next few hours. \"Did you still wanna talk?\" \"No… let's do something.\" \"We have to be quiet, my dad is a ridiculously light sleeper… someone could sneeze in Japan and it'd wake him up.\" Johnny giggles again. Bobby smiles; he's not trying to make him laugh really, but it's nice to see that he could. [ 3:26am ] \"I'm bored of this now.\" \"You're bored 'cause you're losing.\" \"I wasn't expecting you to buy the whole left side of the board...\" Johny waves his hands, gesturing to the plethora of houses and motels placed on nearly every property Bobby owned. \"I can't do anything.\" Bobby smiles, \"It's a strategy.\" \"It's a farce!\" Johnny flips half of the board, pieces going all over the carpet. \"Oh very mature. Help me pick these up, you've tossed them everywhere...\" While Bobby picks up the remaining pieces and strewn paper money, Johnny hops back on his bed. Bobby glances over and addresses him again. \"Do you wanna watch a movie?\" \"Depends,\" He hangs his head upside down over the edge of the bed, voice taking on a slightly strained quality from the position. \"What d'ya have?\" \"Uh, A Clockwork Orange, Laserblast, Dark Star… uh, Sophie's Choice…? Bobby continues digging through a box of VHS tapes, some owned, some rented. He laughs out loud, \"Why do you have that movie?\" \"It's my mom's, she loves that stuff, we also have uh, Fast Times at Ridgemont High but the sleeve is empty... why is the sleeve empty?\" Johnny watches from his position at the end of the bed as Bobby mutters under his breath, still sifting. \"We're gonna fall asleep before we pick anything.\" He smiles. \"We fall asleep anyway… ah! I found it.\" Johnny yawns, \"Pick anything, I don't mind.\" \"Fast Times it is then. It's even rewound.\" They sit on the floor, resting against the bed and propped up by Bobby's numerous throw pillows, sharing a bowl of popcorn hastily sneaked in from the kitchen. Bobby's eyes wander to his immediate left, casting somewhat overt glances to the boy next to him, the soft glow of the television casting shadows in odd places. Johnny's eyes suddenly shift to him, and he has to suppress a slight jump. He flashes him a lazy and silly smile, wide and with teeth, the slight bluish glow making it stand out even more than usual. As Johnny's gaze returns to the TV, he lays his head sideways on one of the cushions. Bobby's eyes remain on him for a moment, thinking about the past few events of the night and the past few hours spent in Bobby's bedroom had lifted the gravity of their situation enough to make it seem like it wasn't a big deal anymore, they'd be able to handle it with ease and give Kreese a proverbial kick in the teeth by willpower alone. It was a welcoming break from reality and Bobby was enjoying it almost as much as Johnny was, even though he knew that in the morning, it would be back to normal. About 40-something minutes into the movie, Bobby's assertion proves itself to be correct, both teenagers not even seeing daybreak. Notes: The lyrics that are referenced in this work are from Touche Amore, songs \"Method Act\" and \"Face Ghost\".[Chapter 4] Notes: It's back to the angst, guys. Just one more to go. Speak \"Time out, time out!\" Everything is hurting. \"Go to your sensei.\" Losing to LaRusso 0-2. Trying and failing to hold back his tears, he reluctantly moves towards Kreese just as he's instructed. His nose is throbbing, bleeding steadily; he can't breathe out of it now and his throat feels tight and too painful to speak. \"Johnny you're a cream puff!\" He flinches as he feels his hands on his face, wiping away the blood. His hand automatically raises, going to stop it before he realizes his mistake. He feels even more humiliated that it had become an automatic instinct for him. When Kreese speaks to him then, quietly grits out that definitive order, he can barely focus long enough to hear him. \"Do you have a problem with that?\" He looks at his eyes for once, agitation and disappointment coming off him in waves and he knows he can't refute it. He's a disappointment and he knows it. He went from having his trust and his respect to being just another student that couldn't carry their own weight. After all actual help he'd given him, after all the hard work he's put in, he is still a one-off, a momentary victory that didn't even last. He hates himself for disappointing his sensei and he hates himself even more for still wanting to please him. He doesn't even have enough of a backbone to stand up to someone who did possibly one of the worst things you can do to someone. You fucking loser! You can't stand up for yourself and you keep going back to him, and you deserve what you get. He hates how he stole his only form of sanctuary. He hates the constant mental split, the fight between wanting nothing more to do with him and still desiring his approval, still wanting to be the subject of his pride. Everything that Sid never bothered to show him Kreese seemed ready to give and losing all that he worked hard for was agonizing to think about. Even when his mother would say how proud of him she was, when she bragged about him to friends and family in an attempt to pad his self-esteem with compliments, it always felt more like a familial obligation rather than real pride. He hated that it was never enough and that deep down he learned to value respect from someone who hurt him so badly. He hates that even after all that effort he still amounted to nothing in his sensei's eyes. He is so tired of not being able to trust the people who were supposed to care about him. The question is, did he ever care about him? He kept quiet about it all and he had called him good, did that count? He called him a good boy, put his hand on his head like a dog and praised him for keeping his mouth shut. What about trusting him to lead the class? Was it strategic favoritism or a genuine endearment? Did he think he had something special about him, or did he just sense he was too weak to ever speak against him? He's getting annoyed at the booing crowd members, they're so loud and he's already disoriented from getting his face practically smashed into the floor. Nobody is cheering him on. He's the antithesis to the underdog; LaRusso has the crowd's admiration and he has next to nothing. They hated him just for doing what he was told. They already think he's nothing but a cheater, a bully. He doesn't want to do this but what choice does he have? Maybe if he won that could be a slap to the face after all that Kreese has put him through, to prove to him that he was still worth something. Jesus Christ, do you hear yourself? Do you hear how fucked up this is? His meager amount of confidence in himself had been shattered the minute LaRusso had put him into the floor. A scrawny New Jersey kid, one who had put a few months into what he'd put six years into, had put him face first to the mat twice over. Even his teammates were yelling at him, insulting him. Everything is too fucking loud and in his face, he can't concentrate at all. Just one hit, that's all he needs and then he would never have to do this again. He could just go home and sleep forever. He wants to curl up in his closet like when he was twelve, curl up there and be left alone to think. To just relax and be able to breathe. He shifts weight back and forth on his feet as he stands there, for a split second eyeing the stands for a certain boy and he gets a heavy feeling in his stomach when he can't spot him anymore. Bobby didn't even get a chance. Somehow he felt responsible for that too, as if he failed to help him and inadvertently ruined his chances at ever winning the title. Even after all Bobby had done for him he still let him down, just like he was gonna let down his whole team and all his friends when this little wop inevitably wins the tournament. The feeling in his chest is horrible and he wishes it would just go away. It's hard enough to concentrate with the squeezing pain on either side of his head, but the anxiety is making him feel like he might be sick. An image worms it's way into his thoughts. A few nights before this he'd watched A Clockwork Orange because Bobby suggested it, and he couldn't pinpoint why the scene of Alex's rehabilitation affected him so much. Was it possible to condition someone unintentionally? He realizes he's breathing way too heavily, choking on the air he tries to take in and he nearly gags, and for a second getting sick in the middle of the tournament floor is a real possibility. He feels awful now, feels nauseous and exhausted but he can't concentrate long enough to alleviate any of it. You're hopeless. He really has ruined you. He can hear Tommy yelling at him . \"Finish him, Johnny, c'mon!\" He shakes his head, temples throbbing in protest. His eyes are burning, aching to be squeezed shut but he blinks it back as he gets into position intent on taking out all his anger on the boy in front of him, and he doesn't even realize the trap he had so willingly flung himself into. No mercy! It's a quick shot to his jaw, head clipped back so violently it dazes him for a minute. Isn't there some sort of enforced rule about not pulling all your strength into a hit? In the few milliseconds that his head was wrenched back from that blow to the face, he is sure his neck is going to snap back and break under the pressure and that'll be the end of it. But would that really be so bad? It takes him a few moments to recoup from the dizziness and the pain, it had all happened so fast he barely processed it. Crawling back from that spot on the mat is gut-wrenching, humiliating. He can't breathe very well but he isn't sure if it's from the anxiety or the injury. He gets up and can't bear to look anywhere but his feet, he doesn't want to see the looks on everyone's faces that just confirmed what he already knew. What a failure you are. Johnny trails behind the rest of his teammates, Bobby by his side trying to give him comforting words. It's not really working and all Johnny really wants to do is go home. He'd mentally made peace with the fact that LaRusso won, he didn't care about that anymore. He handed him his trophy and resigned himself to just go home with his second place award. This hardly mattered anymore. He was so, so tired. Some of the remaining students are lingering outside in the parking lot, Johnny nervously eying Kreese from his position only a few feet away, and Bobby gently squeezes his hand. \"C'mon, I'll take us home. You can stay at my house for the night.\" He was trying to remain calm but he could feel nervousness rising steadily in his chest. The blonde shakes his head, not even looking at him. \"No, uh, just a minute…\" He intends to confront him one last time at least, he doesn't want to run away again. Maybe he would see that he tried. As soon as Johnny makes his way up to him, Kreese gives him such a look of disgust that Johnny almost winces. \"Beat it.\" He swallows, his voice trying to remain steady. \"I tried, sensei.\" Kreese all but laughs in his face. \"I practically handed him to you and you still couldn't do it, you're pathetic, you're a failure.\" That stung more than he expected. Even after all this time he still desired his approval, at least enough respect for him to acknowledge that he tried his hardest, but no, he had nothing anymore. The pain in his throat was making it hard to speak at all. Kreese smiles knowingly, scrutinizing Johnny's face with all the power he knew he still had over him. Still the same after six years, just the same weak and naive boy who ate up any attention you gave him. Even after all this time, Johnny couldn't let go and he knew it. \"What, you gonna cry now? You really are pathetic you know that?\" Tears threaten to fall. \"I did my best.\" \"What did you say?\" Johnny's gaze hardens a little, \"I said did my best.\" He stands up a little straighter. \"You're nothing! You lost, you're a loser!\" Johnny shakes his head, voice quiet, \"No.\" Kreese shakes his head in disbelief, still taunting him. \"No what? Speak up Mr. Lawrence, if you're so keen on it.\" Johnny nearly loses it. \"I said no! You wanna tell me I'm the loser after what you've spent months doing? Are you serious! You've fucking ruined me! Look what you've done, how could you!\" Despite his best efforts, his voice cracks sharply on the last bit, and his last sentence comes half choked out, incoherent and strained. \"You're the loser, man.\" Johnny has now gotten the attention of most of the students standing around him. Johnny's eyes briefly go to Bobby, who looks more than ready to intervene. He didn't even notice that he'd moved closer to them during this whole ordeal, and was now standing only a few feet away, hands tensed and ready at his sides. He resists the temptation to look around him, trying to meet Kreese's gaze. He won't back down this time. He can't. The tension is palpable. \"Am I now?\" \"Yeah.\" Kreese tests his confidence, stepping forward menacingly in a clear display of power. Johnny still backs up despite his intentions and Kreese openly scoffs. \"I'm the loser, huh? Look at you.\" With this, he snatches the trophy from Johnny's lax grip, breaking it in two as he watches the teenager's face fall. He throws it over the roof of a nearby car scattering it over the parking lot, and Johnny looks even more hurt than before. Bobby's eyes plead with him. Just leave it, he's not worth this. Come on, Johnny. But Johnny is stubborn that way. Turning back to his sensei, he shakes his head in an attempt at defiance. \"You're really sick, man. Does anyone else know what you've been doing to me, huh! Anyone else getting special treatment!\" Johnny is whirled around so fast into a chokehold that for a split second nobody does anything. The gravity of the situation hasn't set in yet, Bobby still mentally processing what Johnny just admitted in front of everyone. As soon as his brain registers Kreese's arm around Johnny's neck, Bobby's anxiety rushes to the surface and he reaches out in a fruitless attempt to stop him. \"Hey!\" Tommy is on the other side of them in complete disbelief. \"Hey, what are you doing!\" He's smacked away just as quick. \"Don't!\" \"Stop! Let go of him, he can't breathe!\" \"Mind your business.\" Kreese's voice is stern. \"Stop it!\" Bobby desperately tries to pry his arm off of Johnny's neck. \"Stop, let go of him! Don't touch him!\" He's panicking, livid at his complete inability to stop it all. Again. He can hear Johnny choking. Kreese gets fed up with Bobby trying to intervene; he jabs him harshly in the ribs and Bobby yelps, curling up in pain. He taunts him, \"How does second place feel now, huh?\" His voice makes Johnny's body kick into fight or flight again, squirming with renewed vigor, every cell in his body remembering what usually happens when his voice is that close. No, no, no, no! Stop! Stop it! I can't breathe! He can't squirm away. Let go of me! \"You're gonna kill him!\" Bobby's voice is strained. \"Sensei, please, you're hurting him! He's sorry, okay?\" Everyone's voice is a blur around him, Johnny can't even make out who is saying what at this point. He's desperately trying not to go limp, focusing on the black spots dipping in and out of his vision while his lungs continually burn incessantly for his attention. He's caught in a panic-induced flurry, clawing at his sensei's arm and at his shoulders, but like every past instance of forced restraint, it's a fruitless effort. His fists are like tiny thumps against a concrete wall. A baby rabbit against a grizzly bear. But suddenly the pressure is lifted. He thinks for a moment he's passed out from it and is just experiencing some kind of out of body phenomenon, but no. He's breathing again and he can feel every ache, all the dizziness in his head, the tightening panic in his chest. He gasps out and drops like a ragdoll. His breathing is heavy, deep gasps for air that's a little more than just making up for the prolonged deficit; the kind that had Bobby on edge, readying himself for what he knew was coming. With all the attention currently on the fight between the two men, the intrusive screaming sound quickly brings everyone's attention right to Johnny, crouched on the ground, hands over his head. The loudness quickly shakes Bobby out of his position as he attempts to hush him, a hand going to rest on his shoulders. \"Johnny it's okay, it's alright, it's okay now...\" But Johnny isn't quieting. When Bobby attempts to remove his hands from his head, he panics further, \"NO! Please, stop, stop! Stop touching me!\" Bobby recoils instantly, pain shooting up his ribs into his throat. His hands are shaking slightly, frozen in midair in lieu of a place that he felt was safe to put them. \"Johnny it's okay, it's alright, please it's okay, it's okay.\" He goes to hug him again, gentle arms enveloping him as best he could and Johnny's cries become softer until quiet, hiccuping sobs replace the disturbing shrieking noise. \"Shh, it's okay, it's okay. it's over, he's gone, it's okay, you're safe.\" They have attracted the attention of Tommy, wide-eyed and bewildered at the whole ordeal. An idea dawns on him, beginning to realize that the problem with Johnny is deeper than what he already knew. He looks to Kreese bleeding on the ground, glass from the two smashed car windows embedded in his knuckles, reputation and pride in pieces, but Tommy couldn't bother to feel any sympathy for him. Turning back to Johnny, still huddled on the ground quietly now, he wants to help him. To do something about a situation that he felt had been unfairly kept from him all this time. He wants to hug him, to talk to him, anything to help him, but he just can't. He has no idea how to even approach him now. He looks up again. Dutch, who had been turned away this whole time, is now looking expectantly at him like he was gonna decide the next move. Would they help him, or turn away as he'd already done? Why had he done that in the first place? He was his friend, or he at least thought he was. This whole cutthroat, ruthless idea of who would come out on top, that whole deal, it could sit this one out, couldn't it? This stupid bullshit of who had power over who was beginning to get to him, especially now. Jimmy had been standing there with him, and he too had only looked while the three of them had effectively been beaten in the parking lot for everyone to see. He didn't know whether to think that was better or worse than what Dutch had done. Tommy's thoughts were in complete disarray; everything felt like it was dragging on for hours even though this whole exchange had likely been no longer than a few minutes. A start of a car's engine to his immediate left brings him back to earth, and he is surprised to find that Kreese had gone, car peeling out of the lot and with the bulk of the crowd now dispersed, it's just them again with a few others littering around, in what he assumed was now an absence of a ride back home. Johnny is still crying, head tucked in between his knees, and Dutch is the first to speak up this time. \"Are you fucking serious?\" Bobby's head snaps up. \"The hell is wrong with him? Johnny, get up man!\" \"Shut up, Dutch!\" Johnny wails at the sound and Dutch looks incredulous. \"You're fucking kidding me right?\" Bobby wants to scream at them but for Johnny's sake he tries to keep his voice level, \"Just go home, all of you...\" Dutch is already rushing past them, retreating back the arena. Tommy is still standing in the same spot, broken glass making audible cracks below his feet. Johnny is close to hyperventilating again but Bobby is keeping his arms around him and his head down. He didn't need to see everyone around him like this. After a few minutes, only Tommy remained. Bobby looks up again. He doesn't want to speak now that Johnny has stopped freaking out, so he motions to Tommy with his hands. Go away, shoo. Please, get out of here. He apologizes with his eyes, but he knows that Tommy will more than likely still be upset at this. He lingers for a moment and Bobby mentally pleads with his friend, hoping he understands. Please, Tommy. He mouths the words to him. Eventually he leaves too, but not without a glance over his shoulder at Johnny. Bobby breathes in and out with his friend, feeling his shoulders rise and fall with the effort, and for a second it's so, so quiet. It's already dark and nobody has attempted to bother the two teenagers left in the parking lot yet. The owner of the car they're leaning against hasn't even come for it. How long had they been there? He figures it's probably not been too long. Bobby had driven himself there and he could drive them both home. \"I'm so sorry.\" It's so quiet that he barely hears it. \"Don't be sorry Johnny, it's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.\" He looks to the glass on the asphalt, two car windows smashed in and blood on the ground. They needed to get out of there. \"C'mon, better get outta here before they think we did this…\" They get to his house eventually. Everything feels surreal, like any minute Bobby would wake up and this night would just be a product of eating pizza before bed again. It was Johnny that was expected to win, he was supposed to win and the guys would have a reason to celebrate and later Bobby could come up with some excuse as to why they wouldn't be returning to the dojo the following Monday and everything would be okay. He didn't expect to be told to break Daniel LaRusso's leg. Or for Johnny to freak out and for Kreese to nearly kill him. He didn't know what was worse, hearing Daniel crying in pain at his dislocated knee or Johnny screaming, that awful sound that he wishes he never has to hear again. He remembered looking at Daniel from across the lot, wide brown eyes focused on Johnny, looking so confused. He remembers making eye contact with Daniel, wondering whether or not he looked just as frightened as he did at that moment. \"Are we going in?\" He looks over at Johnny, sitting patiently in the passenger seat, the car idling in the driveway. He was too busy thinking about everything to notice he'd just been sitting there all this time. He shuts off the car and he and him and Johnny step inside, almost immediately greeted by his mother. She hugs them both, asking who won and apologizing that she couldn't make it this year. Bobby always knew she liked to be in the stands, cheering him on. Cheering them all on. She's a good mother, he realized some time ago how lucky he is to have two good parents, a supportive father and caring mother. He knows Johnny's stepfather is an asshole who constantly fights with his mother and yells at Johnny every time he turns around. He remembers Johnny having bruises sometimes even before this whole thing with Kreese started. He doesn't understand what makes Johnny such a target for that sort of stuff, abuse followed the kid like it was divine intervention. He feels Johnny tug discreetly at his sleeve, a little nudge just to ask, 'can we go upstairs?' Considering the circumstances he does okay with all the questions they ask him, temporarily reverting back to that Johnny Lawrence charm that his parents loved. Especially his mother, she absolutely adored him. If only she knew what was happening to him. Upstairs now, Bobby lets him lay on his bed and sits down on the edge of his mattress once Johnny had made himself comfortable. Laying down beside him, Johnny closes the gap between them and places his arm over Bobby's, pads of his fingers resting on his open palm. Bobby is used to this by now, the need for physical contact. He guessed it helped with the anxiety. They sit like that for a while until Bobby breaks the silence. \"We need to do something about this, Johnny.\" It was time to do something about him, about the state he had been in for these past six months. It happened, there's no avoiding it now, certainly no ignoring it. It's not going away. The situation had come to an inevitable breaking point with Johnny practically outing it in front of everyone. \"What do you mean?\" Bobby gestures to him. \"This, you.\" He frowns. \"Yeah well It's over now, I can ignore it and never go back there again. There, done.\" \"You can't just ignore it.\" He scoffs, \"Yes I can. \" \"No, you can't.\" Bobby rubs the bridge of his nose, body tensing up in frustration as Johnny abruptly straightens up. \"Yes, I can. Why can't I? You said it! It's done, it's over with, why would I need to do anything about it now?\" \"Why are you being like this?\" Johnny is visibly agitated. \"What, you against me now too? I don't understand, why is everyone saying there's something wrong with me? Everyone is acting different and I fucking hate it! Can we just drop it!\" He can't help it then. His temper flares at his friend's stubborn denial, and everything Bobby has wanted to say to him in the past months comes rushing forward. \"Are you kidding me right now? Johnny, you had a fucking panic attack in the middle of a crowded parking lot and nearly outed this whole thing! You've been a nervous wreck for months, you can't sleep alone cause you keep getting nightmares, you're so fucking anxious that you're throwing up every morning, and somehow, some-how, you're still not convinced that anything is wrong!\" He's waving his hands around, gesturing wildly to the blonde as he sits on the end of his bed, frustration evident. \"Maybe if you go talk to someone they can get it into your head that something is wrong, cause I don't know how to talk to you anymore Johnny, I really don't. Like come on, do you really not think this is affecting me at all! I mean, just think for once, please!\" He takes a deep breath. There's another tense, ugly silence. Johnny is somewhat embarrassed, never having Bobby yell at him like that before and automatically jumps to the defensive. \"This isn't my fault.\" \"I'm not saying that, Johnny.\" He sits upright, getting off the bed and pacing Bobby's bedroom floor. \"Then why are you yelling at me?\" He looked on high alert, jumpy and guilt-ridden. \"I said sorry and you said it was okay... I apologized, you didn't have to do this, I'm not asking you to do any of this… I'm sorry, okay?\" He's upset, on the verge of tears and Bobby can hear it in his voice. He suddenly feels somewhat guilty for yelling at him like that. Johnny abruptly stops pacing, sinking down to the floor and Bobby quickly gets up again. Couching down to his level, he places his hands on either side of his face. Johnny, still stubborn as always, is not avoiding his eyes anymore and meets his gaze. \"I just want you to be okay. Johnny, it's just hard for me to see you like this. You're not a burden, okay? Please, I- I just… \" He takes a shaky breath in. It's hard to talk with his throat aching like this and he rests his forehead on Johnny's for a few moments. He's overwhelmed with a desire to show his best friend just how much he cares about him right then. Bobby deliberates a moment, almost leans in and closes the gap between his mouth and Johnny's face until he realizes that this wouldn't do anything good for either of them. He's upset and vulnerable, this was not a time to overwhelm him with his stupid romantic inclinations. He quickly shakes the thought away and is left to look at Johnny's eyes only a few inches from his face. He comes to his senses, and pulls away from their close proximity. He doesn't realize the tears have made themselves visible until Johnny wipes one away. \"Don't cry...\" Bobby cracks a smile and Johnny grins warmly. \"We're gonna have your mom thinking we've gone off the deep end.\" He laughs softly again, that little light-hearted sound that Bobby loves to hear, and he remembers the last time he heard it was when Johnny was drunk in his bedroom. Bobby hurriedly wipes his nose. \"Sorry man, I'm supposed to be the one comforting you.\" Johnny hugs him tightly, an action that catches Bobby slightly off-guard. \"No, no... you've been doing that for months, it's my turn.\" That night they both sleep in Bobby's bed, no nightmares or interruptions for the entire nine hours they're asleep. Light is filtering through the blinds in his room as Bobby squints open his eyes, realizing they'd both slept calmly till morning. When his mom calls them both down for breakfast, he gently nudges Johnny awake.

SUMMARY: Hansel and Gretel are saved from a powerful coven of witches by a mysterious maiden with a cryptic past and dangerous secrets. What happens when the twins find themselves face to face with a different kind of witch altogether? I had always been different from the other witches. One. My face wasn't cracked and ugly. Two. I dealt in much stronger witchcraft than the rest of the coven did. Three. I could bend in with the townspeople as though I were just an ordinary being. I never sold my soul to Satan- on the contrary; I never did deal with dark magic. I only dealt in white magic, or the light, as I called it. I could heal, create fire and read auras. The others could destroy lives, cast strong spells and make potions. So it was safe to say that I was the total opposite of evil. But the other witches tried to use me to their advantage, which didn't always work out according to plan. However, I did go into town to trade my items for bread and milk and gossip. And it was one day when I was about twenty years old did I fall into a trap. I had gone into town to trade ten necklaces that I had made for some fresh meat and bread when I was suddenly made aware of eyes watching me. I turned around and frown when I couldn't locate the source of the strange feeling, but I quickly shrugged it off before slipping from the town and onto the path that led into the forest, where I lived with the rest of the coven in our cave. As I walked along the overgrown path, the feeling that I was being followed only intensified. And then, when I reached the mouth of the cave, I found everyone waiting for me with warm smiles. Not good. \"Grab them!\" ordered my mother as the witches ran out and grabbed ahold of two people- a man and a woman- who had evidently been following me. \"Tie her up!\" she barked as the man doubled over in pain from an unknown source. I of course knew what it was. The sugar sickness. I stood there in horror as the witches tied the girl up onto a stone table and left the man on the ground. I was immobilized with shock and anger. I had knew that the coven had been planning on using me for bait, but I didn't think it would had been this soon. And then I spied their dropped weapons. My blood chilled as I looked up into the girl's eyes. I knew who they were. Hansel and Gretel, the legendary witch hunters. I quickly made a decision as I moved towards the back of the cave, pulling the hood of my cloak up so that it concealed my face. And then I created several fireballs- a well sized one. I wanted to distract, not kill- I could kill, if I were pressed to do so. I took a deep breath before aiming my fireballs at the coven. At that very moment, all hell broke loose as chaos reigned over the coven. They all screamed in pain as the fire lightly gazed their skin, leaving severe scorch marks that I knew would get infected. I let the fireballs surround the girl and man as I ran towards the alter where they were, fishing out my knife to cut the girl free before tending to the man. Gretel- that was her name- reached into the pouch at his waist and came back up with a syringe, which she injected into his leg. He instantaneously began to look better. \"Come on!\" I shouted, grabbing their hands and running with them towards the mouth of the cave. Just as we reached the edge of the forest, I turned my back to Hansel and Gretel and reached my arms. A giant tongue of fire came roaring from the cave, spewing out a horrid stench as I lowered my arms. I knew that the coven was dead. But I also knew that I had saved the village from their evil deeds. I had knew what they were doing, but I had been waiting for the right moment to dispose of them and flee to the village with a well woven tale in my mind of how I had been kidnapped by them and forced to live their ways. I turned again and was met by a crossbow and a gun.[Chapter 2] I need more ideas for this fic! Kindly message me with what you think should happen. No idea is too small, nor is it too stupid!

PLEGARIA Se podría creer que el hecho de que uno se dedique a cazar y matar brujas haría que vieras las cosas más terroríficas y por supuesto las más absurdas, estúpidas y depravadas de la tierra. Digo eso de poner de florero un cráneo y en lugar de flores las manos de tus victimas, creo que habla por sí solo. El problema no radica en lo que uno pueda ver respecto a lo vil que puede se llegar a ser un individuo, creo que todos lidiamos con demonios internos y eso es precisamente lo que más me asusta. Por qué ahora no hay monstruos a los cuales derrotar, No hay niños perdidos, Ni mujeres que desaparecen misteriosamente. No hay rituales que detener y claro No hay brujas que lancen algún hechizo. ¡Bueno, si, hay una! aquella que ha lanzado el hechizo más poderoso que ni la protección de mi madre puede repeler, la bruja que lanzo su poderoso hechizo sobre mi se llama Gretel. Bien pueden empezar a burlarse cuando quieran… No se contenga, ¡vamos… sigo esperando! ¡Oh! Ya sé, mejor me van a llamar monstruo, porque eso es lo que soy, el más vil, el más bajo, él de la peor calaña. ¡oh pero bueno, creo que todavía no les he dicho que es lo que he hecho! Valla tonto de mi Cómo espero que ustedes sepan , si yo mismo no se qué mierdas me pasa, pero les contare. Para nadie es un secreto que mi hermana Gretel y yo somos muy unidos, digo cuántos niños son abandonados en un bosque a la mitad de la noche, para luego encontrar una casa de dulce y en ella una bruja que te quiera comer, digo cuantas historias escuchas así, creo que no muy a menudo. Esta experiencia nos hizo consientes a mi hermana y a mí de lo frágil que puede ser la vida humana, incluida la de nosotros. Eso hizo que ambos nos cuidarnos mutuamente mucho. Cuando éramos niños incluso nos bañábamos juntos por seguridad, dormíamos juntos, comíamos juntos, jugamos juntos y bueno muchas cosas las hacíamos juntos. Pero una vez comenzamos a crecer y notar algunas cambios que se sucintaban optábamos porque uno se bañara y el otro vigilara. Fue un cambio que a mí en lo particular me costó asimilar, digo éramos hermanos no había nada de malo en ver una que otra cosa, literalmente éramos uno, pero al cabo de algunos meses incluso yo pensé que era una buena idea e incluso sugerí que empezáramos a dormir separados. En ese momento no le agrado nada a Gretel que sugiriera eso. (-¿eres estúpido o qué?- ) si eso dijo ¡oh! bueno para términos más específicos me lo grito al mismo tiempo que me echaba de la habitación en la noche que ambos cumplimos 15 años, pero que podía hacer digo un hombre tiene cosas que no serian muy bien vista por una mujer y mucho menos por tu hermana, como por ejemplo esos despertares matutinos de todo varón, no son fáciles de ocultar y menos cuando están en la misma cama y con su rostro muy cerca del mío. Una vez que pasamos por el complicado y bochornoso asunto de la pubertad, sentí que había perdido algo, pensé que aquella intimidad que compartíamos de niños se esfumo y de cierta manera lo hizo, pero una vez que nos distanciamos mas por cuestiones fisiologías que sentimentales, algo paso, de una u otra manera otro sentimiento nació en mi acercándome a ella de una manera tan fuerte que aun hoy me da miedo… aquella fuerza que me mantiene atado a mi mundo, a lo único que podía atar mi cordura, mi alma, mi se entero y era el amor a mi hermana. Si ¡AMOR! Pero en ese momento pensé que era el amor fraternal y las circunstancias que nos obligaron a unirnos sobre manera, lo que me llevaba a que mi mundo y toda su función giraron en torno a ella. Siempre supe que Gretel seria y es muy hermosa, nunca cuestione aquello, a pesar del pacto que hicimos sobre no hablar sobre nuestros padres aun tenia y aun conservo vagos recuerdos de mi madre y en ellos siempre aparece como una mujer complemente hermosa, por eso nunca cuestione y no me equivoque sobre la belleza de Gretel aun de niña. Con su piel blanca como la leche fresca, y su boca pequeña y roja como una fresa, su cabello color chocolate que brilla con el sol y aquel par de ojos avellana. Siempre fui consciente de su belleza y creo no ser el único, a cada pueblo donde vamos todos los hombres pueden notarlo, figura fina y fuerte y ese porte firme que a más de uno habra intimidado,claro menos a mí, porque yo la conozco, porque sé que le gustan las fresas más que cualquier cosa en el mundo, porque cuando esta ebria de la por abrasar a la gente que tiene a su lado (claro siempre procuro ser yo quien este junto a ella) porque soy yo el que ve sus mejillas rojas como rosas cuando corre y claro porque yo soy el que mira y cuenta sus pestañas cuando duerme, tan tierna, indefensa e inocente, soy yo el único al que le confiaría su sueño sin reparo, porque podría yo incluso en este momento apuñalarla, estrangularla dormida como se encuentra ahora a mi lado y ella jamás lo sospecharía porque sus armas están fuera de su alcance porque se muestra vulnerable a mí y solo a mí. Muchos hombres se acercaban a ella, unos con buenas y otros con pésimas intenciones que no podían ocultar, pero en medio siempre estuve, yo sabia y se perfectamente que Gretel el capaz de defenderse, digo alguien que sabe usar la ballesta y los cuchillos tan bien como ella es de cuidado, pero siempre estaba ese sentimiento de no dejar que nadie la dañara que nadie la tocara, claro salvo yo. En un principio la punzada que sentía en mi pecho cuando ella hablaba con otro hombre aunque solo fuera para pedir indicaciones la confundí con celos de hermano, era yo quien debía de defender su honra de mujer en ausencia de un padre, aunque ella sola lo hacía muy bien, yo tenía que cuidar a mi pequeña hermana de cualquier vago, patán o mal viviente que osara siquiera poner sus ojos sobre ella, ya ni que decir de sus manos ¡yo era su hermano! Tenía el derecho ¡¿no?! ¡Tenía la obligación! De cuidar y velar por su felicidad, ese es el trabajo del hermano mayor. Por eso apartaba a cualquiera que preguntaba por ella, nadie era lo suficientemente digno. Gretel merecía lo mejor, alguien que la hiciera feliz, que la hiciera reír, cantar, que le diera lo que ella se merecía sin importar como, porque su sola sonrisa valía que arriesgaran sus vidas, pero a mis ojos nadie cumplía con lo requerido, ni siquiera podía imaginar que alguien se llevara a mi hermana lejos de mí, porque para eso era yo su hermano. Aunque bueno, esos pensamientos eran con los que me consolaban y me los repetía una y otra vez cuando sentía que podía haber ahuyentado a algún tipo que pudiera darle una vida tranquila a ella, lejos de brujas, cuchillos, ballestas y peligros, pero no me sumía demasiado en ellos. Después de todo era yo el que debía de cuidar y velar por ella, solo yo. Hoy en día tengo que dejar de mentirme a mí mismo, no son celos de hermano si no celos de hombre y eso es lo que más preocupa. Hay momentos en los cuales su atracción me vuelve casi loco, cuando se acerca y me abraza estrechándome entre sus delgados brazos, cuando me da el beso de las buenas noches, cuando viene a buscarme para una misión, cuando se cuelga a mi espalda y noto lo bajita que es, todo en ella me atrae, me enloquece. Una brasa de la fogata que chasqueo me saco de mi ensimismamiento, entonces fui consciente del ligero peso que estaba sobre mi pierna, Gretel estaba dormida, tranquila y serena, su cabello estaba un poco alborotado pero ahí, iluminada por la tenue luz de la fogata sus finas facciones se veía más definidas, sus suaves labios entre abiertos emanaba su cálido aliento y entonces con el impulso de un niño, toco sus labios con las yemas de mis dedos, lo más suave que me permito para no turbar el dulce sueño que estoy seguro tiene, pues la tenue sonrisa dibujada en sus labios es muestra de ello, toda ella es tan suave, tan inocente muy a pesar de que sus manos sean letales, prodigan las más genuinas caricias con ternura. Una voz en mi cabeza me dice que me incline un poco para poder posar mis labios sobre los suyos y de verdad estoy tentado a hacerlo ¿quiero saber si son dulces como las fresas que tanto le gustan? ¿quiero saber si son cálidos como el fuego? pero tengo que juntar toda mi voluntad para evitar hacerlo, me limito simplemente a acariciar su cabello largo una y otra vez mientras miro de vez en cuando a los lados solo para hacer guardia, o fingir que la estoy haciendo. Justo en este momento es cuando me doy cuenta de lo egoísta que soy, si tan solo pudiéramos quedarnos en este bosque por el resto de nuestras vidas, yo podría hacerla feliz. Porque solo yo la conozco y estaría dispuesto a entregar mi vida por ella sin cuestionarme nunca nada. -las noches ahora son muy silenciosas- su suave voz me sorprende, la miro y noto que ha hablado con los ojos cerrados. -¿los extrañas?- pregunto haciendo a un lado el fleco de su frente, pues se a que se refiere... -un poco- dice. – Uno llega a encariñarse con las personas después de un tiempo- este comentario me dolió mas de lo que realmente esperaba, el solo pensar que Simon llegase a gustarle hace que duela el pecho, soy consciente de que me tenso ante el comentario. –era como tener un par de mascotas revoltosas- ríe ella y es entonces cuando abre sus hermosos ojos, en la obscuridad se ven opacos, pero brillan como si fuesen estrellas, y yo…yo solo puedo hacer uso a todo mi auto control para no besarla. En lugar de eso simplemente desvió la mirada al cielo anhelando por un momento ser solo un hombre que no fuera su hermano para poder amarla como yo deseo. -mañana llegaremos al poblado mas cercano y una semana después podremos llegar a Budapets – dije alejándome un poco para recuperar el control. No la miro, necesito alejarme por unos momentos para que su rostro no sea una tentación. -si, mañana- escuche decir. -y eso es bueno porque apestas- le digo tratando de bromear, porque me sentía incapaz de seguir un hilo de conversación que no fuera decirle cuanto la amaba. -mira quién habla- su tono divertido me relaja un poco, me es más fácil resistirme si esta bromeando, pude sentir que me arrojaba algo no tuve que ser adivino cuando sentí la manzana impactar en mi cabeza. Puede haberla esquivado fácilmente, pero no lo hice ¿porque perderme ese pequeño momento de diversión? Contemplo el cielo y cierro los ojos tratando de llenar mis pulmones de aire fresco para hacerle frente. Inspiro hondo, lo más profundo que puedo hasta que mis pulmones duelen. Pero entonces siento sus delgados brazos rodeándome por la espalda y siento que el aire escapa de mis pulmones de golpe, es aquí donde soy consciente de que me tenso ante su solo contacto y estoy tentado a salir corriendo antes de que mis más bajos instintos tomen control de mi. -¿has estado muy pensativo?- la oigo atrás y trato de ocultar lo que su sola voz provoca en mi. -siempre hay cosas en las cuales pensar- le digo después de un momento de silencio. -siempre piensas demasiado, ese es tu problema- escucho su voz muy cerca de mi oído. Su abrazo me aprisionaba completamente, llenándome de su aroma, haciéndome dolorosamente consciente de su presencia tan cerca de mí. Mi corazón se disparo por los aires, tengo que resistir el impuso de pasar mi manos sobre las suyas en un acto que habia hecho miles de veces cuando me sumía en mis cavilaciones, pero ahora, ahí, Sentía que si tocaba alguna parte de su piel desnuda no podría controlarme, podría hacer algo que lo cual me arrepintiera o peor a un, dañarla a ella. Así que tomando más aire del que necesitaba y cerrando los ojos pude hablar. -solo me acorde de Mina eso es todo- le dije tratando de hacerlo sonar como añoranza. Si era sincero ya casi no me acordaba de ella, salvo por que fue la última mujer con la que me acosté, pensando en Gretel. Recordaba vagamente que era bonita, de piel blanca y cabellos naranjas como el atardecer ¡oh! Y claro que era una bruja blanca. El momento en concreto que recuerdo muy claro fue en aquel lago donde me curo, diciendo que el agua del estanque era curativa. Pero no pude perderme en esos recuerdos, porque sentí como los brazos de Gretel me soltaron. -oh- dijo ella. –lo siento, se que fue especial para ti- dijo tranquila, pero no tuve el valor de girarme todavía ¿Cómo podía encararla? ¿la había traicionado? ¿se podía traicionar a tu hermana? Era bastante obvio que no era la primera vez que me había acostado con una mujer, pero si hay un punto a mi favor jamás deje de pensar en ella, con todas y cada una era ella a la siempre le hacía el amor, era suya la piel de acariciaba con la mas infinita ternura y la que besaba con amor. En todas y cada una veía a Gretel porque jamás traicione a mi corazón. Mina no fue la excepción, era linda claro, pero no significo nada para mí, salvo que la vi morir y por un hecho del que todavía no estoy enterado del cómo pero Gretel se entero de nuestra pequeña aventura (casi puedo jurar que por Simon). Al que le dio un toque de inexistente romance que jamás sentí por ella. Pero en ese momento tuve que aferrarme a ese pensamiento antes de siquiera voltear a mirarla. El frio se instalo en mi cuerpo cuando sus brazos me abandonaron. -la vida continua Hansel- le escuche tranquila y consoladora. –No creo que le gustaría verte de esa manera- nuevamente tomo aire y me atrevo a mirarla. Y cuando por fin lo hago ella esta de espaldas a mí, mira el fuego quieta, como si fuera algo de extrema importancia. -solo me acorde- le digo después de un minuto de silencio. Todo mi cuerpo me pide que cruce las distancia y que la tome entre mis brazos, pero una pequeña vocecilla dentro de mi cabeza me indica que si me acerco a ella podría cometer una estupidez. -hace daños acordarse de algunas cosas- dice sin voltear al verme, sé que no puedo seguir así, mi actitud la lastima y eso lo sé, también sé que esto nos está distanciando y es lo último en lo que quiero pensar, pero ¿Qué puedo hacer? Un error en falso y puedo lastimarla. –Es mi turno, descansa- su frase me despeja y solo soy consciente de que se aleja de mi cuando ella pasa a mi lado. –voy al rio a lavarme un poco- dice sin mirarme, tal vez molesta por mi actitud y yo solo puedo decirme a mí mismo. -esto es por tu bien- pero soy consciente que ella no me escucha. Me obligo a mi mismo a permanecer en mi sitio en lugar de salir corriendo tras ella. – Es por tu bien- me vuelvo a repetir como si fuera una oración. HOLA, SE QUE PUEDE NO RESIVA MUCHOS COMENTARIOS EN ESTA HISTORIA PERO NO ME IMPORTA, EN CUANTO VI ESTA PELICULA DE HANSEL Y GRETEL CAZADORES DE BRUJAS, SUPE QUE TENIA QUE ESCRIBIR ALGO... ESPERO ME DIGAN SI LES GUSTA, SI NO, SI LE FALTA ALGO SI LE SOBRA, ESPERO SUS COMENTARIOS...[Chapter 2] INSTINTO -dos habitaciones- mi voz sale tensa, esa era la octava posada a la que íbamos en el pueblo pequeño y todo por unas estúpidas festividades de las cuales no teníamos la mas mínima idea; estábamos cansados, sucios y hambrientos, lo único que queríamos era poder descansar decentemente, Gretel no era la persona más amable una vez que se juntaban esas tres cosas, incluso yo estaba ya bastante irritado. -lo siento señor pero no tenemos habitaciones desocupadas- -¡QUE!- fue lo único que atine a decir. Y centésima vez escuche suspirar a Gretel que también estaba tan cansada y molesta como yo. -¿esta seguro?- pregunte esperando que el posadero dijera que estaba de broma. -lo siento señor pero el festival de la próxima semana, nos tiene llenos- no entendí que tenia que ver una estúpida festividad con que todas las habitaciones de las posadas estuvieran ocupadas. -bien ¿sabe dónde puedo encontrar otra?- -no- aquello fue completamente tajante. Una vez fuera del lugar Gretel comenzó su orquesta de insultos contra todo aquel posadero que no tenía habitaciones, yo estaba demasiado cansado como para perder mi tiempo y mi energía en eso, tal vez tendríamos que movernos y llegaríamos a otro poblado. Pensando que tal vez serian un par de horas mas saque el mapa para mirar. Pero con frustración miro que el poblado mas cercano nos llevaría dos semanas, me paso las manos por la cara cansada y dejo que un poco de molestia se escape en un ligero gruñido. -tengo hambre- dice Gretel que de inmediato capto como un \"movámonos de aquí o lo mato\" -vamos- con paso cansino la sigo. Cuando por fin encontramos un lugar donde comer, el humor de mi hermana y el mio no es el mejor. -tal parece que tendremos que acampar de nuevo- le suelto una vez que come su estofado. Ella solo asiente y cuando puede hablar dice. -no es como si tengamos otra opción- -¿¡necesitan donde quedarse!?- pregunta la chica que me trae la cerveza; De cálido cabello dorado como el trigo a punto de ser cosechado, una tierna niña no mas de 18 años nos sonríe. -¿Qué?- decimos los dos al mismo tiempo. -¿Qué si buscan un lugar donde quedarse?- Gretel la mira desconfiada. -¿Cómo sabes?- su pregunta fue un poco brusca, pero al parecer la chica no tenia reparos en eso. -bueno se ve que son forasteros- la miro tratando de ver que pretende. – además los escuche decir que acamparan afuera del poblado- dijo sonriente. – Simplemente pensé que de dormir al aire libre a dormir en mi casa no les caería mal, por no decir que lo que pagarían en mi casa seria mejor que en una posada en estas fechas- termina su frase y me guiña el ojo de forma coqueta y juguetona. tal vez era porque estábamos muy cansados o porque simplemente nos dio confianza aquella chica fue que ambos asentimos. –en un rato salgo, porque no me esperan y nos vamos juntos- dijo atenta y yo simplemente sonreí, la idea de que Gretel pasara una noche mas en el bosque me desagradaba, estaba bastante cansada y el ultimo trabajo no dejo bajos de reservas de comida y por desgracia el dinero no se podía comer, además nos hacia falta un baño y quería que ella descansara bien. -¿crees que este bien?- pregunto Gretel pero no era que aquello fuera buena idea, era la única solución que teníamos. -¿se te ocurre alguna otra idea?-ella me miro como tratando de entender un mal chiste, tal vez pensaba que podía estar interesado en la chica. Digo ella era bonita eso cualquier idiota podía decirlo, pero como habia dicho antes el único interés por una mujer que tenia era por mi hermana, además por el momento la única cosa que podía sentir, eran mis músculos adoloridos y mi cuerpo suplicando férreamente un baño. ... -es por aquí- nos indico tranquila. Caminamos a las afueras del poblado, en un principio me parecía que podíamos ser emboscados pues era como si estuviésemos internándonos otra vez en el bosque, pero me reconforto la idea de que la chica fuera amable con Gretel y ella parecía corresponder de la misma manera; tal vez si dejaba la paranoia esto no era tan malo. -¿y que los trae por aquí?- su pregunta me sorprendió un poco, pero era algo bastante normal. -vamos a Budapes- respondió Gretel. -entonces todavía les queda mucho camino por recorrer- -bastante- dijo ella. -y dinos ¿vives sola?- pregunte, la curiosidad de encerrarme con dos mujeres hermosas aunque bastante atractiva me estaba poniendo nervioso. Ella se giro y me sonrió de una manera demasiado extraña, tal vez algo maliciosa, pero ese gesto se me hacia tan natural en ella que no me dio escalofríos ni mucho menos me pareció extraño. -¿te interesa saber si podrás escabullirte a mi habitación una vez que tu esposa se duerma, para hacerme cosas sucias?- esto me dejo en shock, y no por el hecho de que supusiera que yo seria tan patán, como para meterme a su recamara, o su alusión a las supuestas cosas sucias que podría hacerle, que si bien no eran tan descabellada la idea, yo era un caballero. -yo…y…- balbuce. -es demasiado decente- la voz de Gretel se me adelanto. -es una lástima- dijo ella haciendo un puchero como el de una niña que le fue negado el dulce después de la cena. – Pero eso se puede arreglar- Con demasiada complicidad mire a ambas chicas me regalaban una sonrisa de fingida complicidad, algo que me molesto y me gusto en igual manera; era difícil que Gretel se llevara bien con otras chicas, casi nadie podía aguantar su carácter fuerte y su mente ágil. -ja-ja-ja, que graciosas- pese a que estaba todavía sorprendido una pequeña alegría se anido en mi pecho, y por estúpido que pareciera, el que ella no negara pero tampoco sacara de su error a la chica de nuestro parentesco me hizo sentir bien. -pero no has respondido mi pregunta- volví a repetir. -valla que eres ansioso- rió ella. Mi ceño fruncido no paso desapercibido ante la evasiva de mi pregunta, estaba tentado a jalar a Gretel y exigirle una respuesta. –Tranquilo- dijo y yo me descoloque. –si te hace sentir mejor, no estaremos solos, mi esposo estará también- no supe como interpretar esta respuesta, por una parte el saber que no estaríamos solos me gustaba, pero el saber que habría otro hombre rondando la casa donde nos quedaríamos, hacia que algo dentro de mi, algo salvaje… algo parecido a un lobo, gruñera por el solo hecho de que otro hombre siquiera oliera a mi hermana, un instinto bastante básico. O por lo menos eso pensaba. -ah, ¿eres casada?- pregunto Gretel demasiado interesada. -si, hace poco mas de medio año- -bueno, pues felicidades- dijo ella y solo por un momento pude captar algo en la voz de ella, ¿era anéelo? Tal vez. -yo…- me quede a media frase cuando por fin se pudo divisar, una pequeña pero acogedora casa. Ambos la miramos pues con la luz de la tarde, aquella casa, parecía sacada de algún cuento de hadas, dos plantas y lo que parecía ser un pequeño jardín que se encontraba a los lados, flores y tal vez un poco de maleza. -mi esposo, no debe tardar en llegar, así que vamos- nos indico y nosotros solo la seguimos. Una vez dentro, no nos decepciono, acogedora, fue lo que ambos pensamos. No era lujosa. Claro que no pero era encantadora y sencilla algo me hizo pensar que era la clase de casa que me gustaría darle a Gretel, pero rápidamente deseche esos pensamientos, suficientes problemas ya tenia como para empezar a fantasear. -esta será su recamara- nos indico.- Estoy segura de que estarán muy cansados, preparare la cena en lo que ustedes se asean, el baño es la ultima puerta del fondo, el agua estará lista en unos momentos- -espera, deja que te ayude- rápidamente se ofreció Gretel. -no te preocupes, deben estar cansado y si me van a pagar como si fuera una posada, será mejor que tenga listos los alimentos- sonrió y esto nos hizo reír a ambos. – descansen y en un momento les llamo- tras decir esto nos dejo solos a ambos con caras perplejas. -supongo que todavía hay gente amable en este mundo- dije mientras bajaba las nuestros morrales donde teníamos guardadas nuestras armas, suponíamos que no daríamos suficiente confianza si veía nuestras armas. -mas bien dicho, creo que estaba mas interesada en ti que en otra cosa- esto fue una sensación agridulce; dulce por el hecho de que pudieran existir celos por parte de ella, algo retorcido dentro de mi se alegro, pero también el hecho de que ella pensara que me acostaba con cualquiera me ofendía de alguna manera, cosa que si bien tenia fundamentos, tampoco era como para que de verdad pensara que me acostaba con toda fémina que se parara enfrente mío. -creo que estas exagerando- me defendí. – no escuchaste que ella está casada- por fin tuve el valor de mirarla. –Además ¿por qué querría acostarme con ella?- tal vez soné un poco brusco, pero no me hacía gracia el hecho de que ella pensara que era un mujeriego. Su cara denoto un poco de sorpresa para después descomponerme con una tímida sonrisa. -lo siento- dijo, aunque no sabia porque se estaba disculpando exactamente, pero yo tampoco dije nada mas. Con calma y en silencio comenzamos a desempacar unas cuantas cosas, estratégicamente escondimos nuestras armas pero fue más por costumbre que por que nos sintiéramos amenazados. -será mejor que te metas a bañar primero, yo terminare de guardar algunas cosas- le dije una vez que vi como se soltaba el cabello y lo examinaba con desagrado. -¿seguro?- pregunto. -claro, primero me gustaría echarle un vistazo a la casa, tengo que asegurarme que no sea peligrosa- su ceño se frunció un poco analizando tal vez erróneamente la información, pero después lo relajo, se giro dándome la espalda, pensé que saldría de la habitación pero se acerco a la pequeña cómoda de donde saco el pequeño cofre que le había comprado hacia mas de 15 años con la paga de nuestro primer trabajo. No me sorprendía que lo trajera, lo que no sabía era que guardaba dentro. Cuando cerró el cofre se giro de nuevo a mi y sin previo aviso me lanzo algo que apenas tuve tiempo de atrapar; al abrir la mano el objeto que brillaba redondo de oro me dejo con la boca seca de la impresión. -recuerda que estamos casados- dijo mientras ella se colocaba la otra argolla dorada en su dedo. –no se te ocurra hacer ninguna estupidez- y tras decir esto cerro la puerta sonoramente dejándome con la boca abierta. Mil y un preguntas se acumulaban en mi cabeza pero la que mas destacaba era ¿de dónde rayos había sacado ese par de sortijas?, mi cerebro estaba embotado mientras analizaba la situación, pero lo único que bien podría procesar era que no quería tener problemas con aquella chica que tan amablemente nos había ofrecido su casa. Sintiendo un mescla de emociones que iban desde la felicidad a la decepción coloque la argolla y después de terminar de acomodar lo que faltaba decidí salir para verificar el perímetro. Bajando las escaleras pude escuchar un par de voces provenientes de lo que podía identificar como la cocina, ya que esta despedía un agradable aroma a comida que rápidamente hizo que mi estomago rugiera. -pero ¿Cómo se te ocurrió hacer eso?- la voz era claramente masculina, algo dentro de mí se puso rígido algo muy animal una vocecilla en mi cabeza me decía que otro hombre significaba un rival ¿pero rival de que y porque? Algo no andaba bien, estos celos realmente me estaban enfermando, tal vez si necesitaba un desahogo urgente y claramente ya lo estaba considerando dado que la ciudad no estaba muy lejos. -el dinero nos viene bien, además se ve que son buena personas- dijo la chica, con cuidado y el sigilo que te provee el estar siempre alerta, me acerque a la puerta, solo para mirar una escena que me lleno de celos. Ahí en la cocina un hombre alto y de cabello rubio abrazaba a la chica mientras esta pasaba sus brazos por el cuello y se besaban. Pero no era celos para con la chica, eran celos porque yo no podía hacer lo mismo con Gretel ¿Qué rayos me estaba pasando? Sin pretenderlo golpee algo, lo que llamo la atención de nuestros anfitriones. Y como ya no podía escapar, hice lo único que podía hacer en ese momento. -lo siento no quise interrumpir- cuando mis anfitriones me miraron pedí estar en otro lado, ya saben asesinando una bruja o estar cayendo de un risco, cualquier cosa que parecer un curioso entrometido. Pero no… estaba ahí en una situación bochornosa. – solo quería hacer un poco de tiempo para que Gretel termine de bañarse- dije en una patética excusa.; la chica al parecer no tenía problemas en ser interrumpida, pero su compañero no podía ocultar primero su molestia y luego su desconfianza. Pero después como si un pensamiento se hubiera aparecido, me sonrió un poco mas tranquilo, tal vez percatándose de que no seria una amenaza. Mientras que para mi algo dentro de mi gruñía y no sabía porque. -hola, mucho gusto soy Peter, el esposo de Gabrielle-inmediatamente estire mi mano aceptando su saludo. -soy Hansel, mucho gusto- dije. Pero algo extraño me asalto en ese momento, algo de lo que no me había parado a reparar en primera instancia, y era que estos dos chicos eran muy parecidos, el tono de sus cabellos era diferente, pero sus ojos color verde, sus narices afiladas e incluso la similitud de sus bocas era demasiado parecidas, algo no estaba cuadrando en este punto, pero tampoco estaba pensando demasiado las cosas; como si fuera fuego o por lo menos a mi me pareció la argolla comenzó a calentarse, mas no tuve tiempo de pensar en otra cosa cuando Gretel hizo su aparición. -ha..hola- fue lo único que atino a la par que terminaba de secar su cabello; el aroma a hierva fresca y el agua del baño me lleno en la nariz de forma tan real, que mi imaginación me llevo a un estanque de noche con ella en medio del agua y desnuda. Tuve que sacudir mi cabeza rápidamente porque no era sano llegar a ese lugar. Para mi fortuna el hombre llamado Peter la miro de pies a cabeza, analizándola; eso no me gusto para nada y como si siempre lo hubiera hecho la tome por la cintura y le di un cálido beso en la mejilla. -ella es Gretel mi esposa- algo cosquilleante dejo estas palabras en mis labios y por extraño que pareciera pude notar como el sonrojo adorno sus mejillas ante estas palabras; no quise pensar otra cosa salvo que estaba apenada por esta situación. -mucho gusto y bienvenidos- ambos nos miramos esperando algo ¿preguntas u otra cosa? Pero nada de eso llego. -seré mejor que te metas a bañar apestas- dijo Gretel apartándose suavemente. -claro- dije no sin antes besar de nuevo ahora las comisuras de sus labios. –mientras podrías aprender un poco de cocina de Gabrielle, te hace falta aprender a cocinar- inmediatamente frunció el ceño en completo desagrado por mi comentario, pero eso era mejor que tenerla avergonzada, por lo menos en esta situación, ya después lideraría con las consecuencias.

The waterfall she had been left at was some a distance away from any path. The troll had done a good job tending to her wounds, oddly enough, but she wasn't fit enough to take on a witch. Which would be soon if she didn't find shelter. Red streaked across the sky as the sun disappeared behind the trees. The shadows were already drawing longer. While the siblings were immune to any magic thrown at them, Gretel still felt the paranoia that had possessed the dark since they had been children- since the event they never spoke of happened. She almost wished she had someone else here, just to have a reason to be strong. Every rustle made her nervous. Her imagination was already playing tricks on her- a witch, the troll, even those men were out there waiting to jump out at any moment. If she didn't know any better, she'd say their lights were in front of her. Her thoughts were interrupted by a sudden light. She readied for a fight before discovering that she was still alone. The small orb glistened in front of her eyes. Her head must've been hit harder than she thought. The huntress tried ignoring it and walked passed it. But there it was again, and again! No matter which direction she went in this woods the orbs always had a habit of showing up. \"Stop following me!\" Gretel cursed herself as soon as she snapped. It was just in her head after all. Yelling was only going to draw trouble. ..Make that more trouble. In front of her stretched an entire trail of those orbs. Seeing as they'd probably follow her anyway, the huntress went where they wanted. She was ready for anything: a witch, trickery, another trap. Somehow, a house never came to her mind. It didn't look like it had been lived in for some time. Not even the lights went inside. Everything creaked, even the floor. Gretel walked soundlessly. It wasn't exactly a big building. The largest room was for the kitchen and gathering area. Even through the dust it was obvious what it all had once been. It all looked familiar though. She told herself it was nothing. Many building had this layout; some the siblings had stayed at had even had the same cots set up for the adults to care for the fire. There was only one set up, so the mother probably stayed downstairs at night… except how did she know that? She had almost convinced herself it was a simple guess when she knew another thing she couldn't have. Her body moved on its own to the spot behind the wall. There was the ring, the rusted remains of a secret hidden for decades. The trapdoor opened almost willingly. Gretel knew she should've stopped there, her every instinct telling her it wasn't safe. But there was something natural and familiar that the stale musk of time couldn't hide. One foot followed the other without fail, even as the wood turned to rock. The glow that came from some was the only reason she could see the cave in front of her. She'd seen enough witch lairs to recognize this one, as disused as it was. Wax from candles left lit dripped down to a thick book. Gretel gingerly touched the lever cover. From look of the pages, it was far more ancient than the stones around it. It almost looked like one of those family bibles. The fancy was enough to have her open to some random page. Even a rookie would have known better, though the blinding light was new. Her mind tried to find some sort understanding in the overload of senses. As her body slowly shut down, she could have sworn she heard a voice. \"This is your inheritance. It can never replace what was taken, but perhaps you can keep others from suffering as you have.\" Gretel's eyes opened what seemed like a second and what felt like hours later. The voice had seemed so familiar yet so distant. Could it have been a dream? The sounds upstairs seemed to say otherwise. She and Hansel may have promised not to talk about their past but she couldn't hold her tongue any longer. It was time to get some answers.[Chapter 2] \"HANSEL!\" Hansel instinctively gripped the knife in his side. He was barely aware of the floor rising up to meet him as the witch tossed him down to the witch lair below. A coldness was beginning to flow through him, starting at his limbs and making its way to the pool of warmth around the wound. Somewhere in his fleeting consciousness, he knew he was dying. They always knew that this was something that could happen. Hell, it almost did at their first encounter. Somehow, even after all his close calls, he wasn't ready. It wasn't supposed to end like this. The witches still had the children, were about to start some witchy form of the end of the world, and worst of all, they had his sister. Gretel…damnit. Despite everything, it was failing her that hurt the most. Her scream still echoed in his ears. The look on her face stared at him as his eyes fluttered shut. Then, it was gone. All of it: the pain, the coldness, even the last remains of his sister's memory- all gone. And in their place was..nothing. Almost like a weight was lifted off them, his eyes flew open. Or at least he thought they did. Everything around him was black. Somehow, he was on his feet and shuffling forward. There was something ahead, something he had to get to. A soft light appeared in the furthest point of his vision. It was warm, and friendly, almost welcoming. It was wonderful, uplifting, prefect. The feelings were interrupted by a strange but familiar pressure on his shoulder. \"No, not again.\" That voice was almost too lifelike, too familiar to be real. The shadow moved in front of him, blocking the light. Hansel brought his eyes up to glare at the figure. What gave them the right to keep him from going reaching the warmth that was waiting for him? \"It's not your time yet.\" The voice answered right on cue, as though they were inside his head. \"You still have things to do, remember?\" It all came back as suddenly as it left. His head pounded as the memories flooded back all at once. The town, the witches, the kids, the house-\"Gretel!\" \"Yes, Gretel. Your sister needs you.\" The man, now more recognizably human as the light behind him began to fade, rose a hand to point back into the black void. Hansel didn't waste any time running back in that direction. There would be time to rest later. Now, now he was needed more than ever. He turned back once to send his gratitude but his blood ran cold at the sight. The man behind him was in simple outdoors clothing, holding a lantern that was almost as bright as his smile. Not a day's difference since that night in the woods. \"Father?\" \"Set their asses on fire for me.\" Just like their last memory, Hansel watched his father blow out the lantern and leave him alone in dark. Only this time, he didn't feel abandoned. Though, it might've been because of the coldness that came back to his limbs. His head spun and as much as he tried to fight it, he began to lose consciousness again. Falling was the last thing he felt before his eyes shut. Then there was only light.

It was a beautiful windy afternoon when I finally arrived home, my elegant home appearing in the distance. It looked the same, it looked like it hadn't changed at all...but I knew that was wrong. I could feel something in the air around me. I could feel a strange change, a strangeness that had forced me to come home earlier than I had planned. My sister was always the one with the spirit visions, but I had always had feelings. The air would change, the atmosphere or there would be some little tingling in the back of my mind when something would happen...and right now I could feel it, like a small migraine. Looking up, I saw that the carriage had stopped and I got out,walking to the doors while the maids got my bags out. Still the same, I looked around the house, smiling softly as I made my way towards my fathers office. I took a deep breath and knocked, waiting for my father to call me in. \"Enter\" my fathers warm voice sounded from the other side and I opened the door, smiling brightly when he looked up and saw me walk in. \"Iliana!\" My father got up and walked to the other side of the desk. \"You are back early!\" I laughed softly, meeting him half way and giving him a hug. \"Yes father. It's good to be back.\" When he released me he sat on the edge of his desk and motioned for me to sit in the chair. His smile never leaving his face. \"How was your trip?\" I say down and crossed me legs, something that people in the town never liked but I was never one to follow rules. \"It was great, father! There were so many amazing sights!...I would like to go back one day...but sadly I got homesick.\" I leaned forward. \"How have things been here?\" My father, who had been smiling as I spoke, frowned and rubbed his temple. \"Things have been...good. Your sister has found a suitor...\" There were warning bells ringing in the back of my head but I smiled brightly at my father, this must be why I had come back. This must have been why I kept feeling that strange sensation. \"REALLY? That's great, father!\" My fathers frown deepened. \"...what is it? Is there something wrong with the man? Does he treat her badly?\" I asked, making my voice sound afraid. I could tell that my act was working. My father had never really paid much attention to me as Edith and I were growing up. She had always been my fathers favorite while I had been my mothers, he never knew how to treat me after our mother had passed away. So it was always very easy to play him, make him think what I wanted him to think. \"No, no. He treats her with the outmost respect...\" My father scratched his cheek, looking away as he thought of what next to say. \"There is just...something off about he and his sister.\" This was most definitely why I had come back. All the bells in my head were ringing now. I couldn't let my father know, though. So I sat back and smirked, playing it off. \" father...could it possibly be because he is courting your eldest daughter?\" I asked, a smile in my voice. My father, still looking away in thought, shook his head. \"No, I was fine with Alan trying to court her.\" I laughed out loud and sat back, my elbow on the armrest and my head on my hand. \"Yes, well...we've know Alan all of our lives. Of course you would be fine with that courtship...now this person is a complete stranger.\" I stood up and walked to him. \"If it will make you feel better...I will try to get to know this brother and sister. Be near them, and analyze them for you. You know how Edith and I are, we are a package deal. They won't think something is going on. I will keep an eye on them for you.\" Father turned his head towards me and nodded, smiling softly at me. \"If you do not approve of him, if you see anything wrong with him...you will let me know immediately?\" I smiled brightly, saluting him. \"Of course!\" I patted his shoulder. \"I will go look for her now.\" \"They will be at the party in the park.\" I nodded and started to walk away, my father stopping me with his next sentence. \"Oh...how about we find you a suitor now, since your sister has found one? I remember you two promising to have a joint wedding?\" I turned to him and laughed. \" No.\" I turned and began to walk away again. \" I am still a child, father. You can't make me get one...I mean you CAN but I hope you don't.\" I stopped at the door opening it. \" you are eighteen, Iliana. The same age as your sister and she has a suitor.\" I turned to my father, a pout on my face. \"But she as always been the more mature one.\" I stepped back and closed the door, hearing my fathers loud laughter through it. I smirked and walked away, today would be fun. This suitor of my sister would never see me coming, he would be in a world of pain if he wanted to harm my sister. He and that sister of his. A.N: What did you think?[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER; I DO NOT OWN CRIMSON PEAK OR THE CHARACTERS. A.N: hope you guys like this chapter! Looked around once I had gotten to the party. There were so many people. Most of them I couldn't stand. The wind blew around me, my hair blowing with the breeze. I had forgotten to put up my hair in the typical bun, but since I wasn't engaged, it was fine to have it down. I kept walking forward, looking around to see if I could see this mysterious man with my sister, and when I finally saw them, I faltered in my step. No. I could feel my body and heart freeze in place. I closed my eyes. I took a deep breath, straightened my shoulders and walked towards my sister with a resolve. \"Ah, Iliana!\" I turned to the person who Yelled my name and froze with fear. I could hear myself groan softly, why? Why did she always single me out, how could she always find me? I could see Edith turn towards us and open her mouth in happy shock. The man next to her turning towards me as well and his body straightening. I took a deep breath and put on my lady face on, something that I always did when people like this person were nearby. \"Hello, Lady McMichael.\" I put on a soft smile. \"How are you?\" My voice and features turning softer. Lady McMichael hugged me tightly, patting my back as she did. Lady McMichael was the mother of my childhood best friend, Alan. He would always play with Edith and I when we were younger and as we grew up we became close. Then one day he decided to go study somewhere else, he wanted to be a doctor you see, and we lost contact. I hadn't seen him in a while. I wondered if he had come back. \"I am very good, Iliana.\" I shook my head, getting rid of my thoughts, paying attention at Lady McMichael again. \"I have organized this party and the guests seen to be enjoying it greatly.\" The lady motioned with her hand around the park and that have me an excuse to send Edith a look of help. But of course she did not see it because of he paying attention to that man, he was leaning close to her whispering in her ear. \"I hope you are enjoying yourself, as well.\" I narrowed my eyes and turned back to Lady McMichal. I smiled kindly, my hands together near my stomach. \"I've only just gotten here, it seems like a very well thought out party. If you'll excuse me-\" I was about to walk towards Edith when Lady McMichael latched on to my arm. I could see Edith smiling brightly at me, her face full of amusement. \"Oh! Of course! How was your trip, dear? Did you meet any suitors?\" Lady McMichael asked, leaning towards me as if telling me a great big secret. I could feel my features twitching, they wouldn't last much longer. The annoyance would show. I turned to Edith again and saw her amused expression, I narrowed my eyes at her. She was so dead later on. \"It was an amazing trip.\" I answered mechanically, not really paying attention to what I was saying. \"Saw so many sceneries. Hope to be back one day. And no, I did not meet any suitors. I do not fancy a suitor, right now.\" I stopped speaking when I saw a woman approach Edith and the man. She met my eyes and we stared at each other. The sister. \"If you will excuse me-\" Again, Lady McMichael interrupted me. She had a knack of doing that. \"That is great! That means that my Alan has a chance to be a suitor. It would be great to have our families unite in marriage.\" I wish I had paid more attention. Then I would have know what I had agreed to...I would have known that I had signed my name to the devil himself. \"That is great, Lady McMichael. We should talk more about this, some OThER time. But right now..\" I pulled my arm from her grasp. \" I have not seen my sister in a few months.\" I smiled prettily at her. \"I would really like to go see her and her new suitor.\" Her face faltered, she had never liked my sister for some reason. Maybe because Edith always had her head in the clouds...wonder how she would treat me when she found out I was the same way? \"Of course! I will set a date with your father so we may speak more about the arrangement. Have a lovely day, dear!\" She leaned in and kissed my cheeks before leaving me. I exhaled deeply. Why was it that I always got tired when I spoke to her? I turned to Edith and stuck my tongue out in disgust. I could hear her laughter coming closer to me and I opened my eyes. \"Not. A. Word, Edith.\" Edith covered her mouth to hide her smile and hugged me tightly. \"It is good to see you, sister!\" I hugged Edith back, my eyes opened, starting at the couple standing behind her. I narrowed my eyes at them. \"Yeah, yeah. Me too Edith.\" The couple stared at me, one narrowing their eyes while the other full out stared. Edith finally let go, after what seemed hours and turned to the couple, her arm holding on to mine. \"Lina, these are the Sharpe's. Thomas and Lucille.\" Edith smiled at Thomas and Lucille. \"Sir Thomas, Lady Lucille this is my twin sister, Iliana.\" Lucille was the first to break the silence, stepping forward and curtsying. \"Nice to meet you, Lady Iliana. You do not look a-like.\" Her face was friendly enough...but I could feel that she was anything but friendly. I stepped forward, Edith still attached to my arm, and held out my hand. \"Nice to meet you too, Lady Lucille.\" I could feel Lucille surprised at my hand, guess she didn't expect me to greet her like a man...but I did not like her. I would never curtsy to her. Lucille finally shook my hand, my grip strong, but not strong enough to hurt her. \" we are fraternal sisters. She got our fathers good looks and I got mothers bold behavior.\" I turned to Thomas and extend my hand again. \"...nice to meet you, as well, Sir Thomas.\" I could feel my eyes narrowing on their own. Thomas just stared at me before grabbing my hand in his. His eyes never leaving mine, he leaned down and kissed the back of my hand. I could feel electricity running up my hand and arm, earning an inaudible gasp from both of us. \"...It is a pleasure to meet you, too, lady Iliana.\" He kept my hand in mine as we stared at each other, seconds turned to minutes and I could see Lucille's hands clenching tightly. My jaw tightened. \"Yes...\" \"Uh...sister...\" I let go of Thomas's hand quickly, coming back to earth. \"May I speak to you? In private?\" I looked at both Thomas and Lucille and smiled fakely at them. \"Of course,\" I turned back to Edith and smiled. \" sister dear. Let us go near that beautiful tree.\" I pointed to the tree a few feet away from us and pulled her along, trying to get away from them as fast as I could. Once we arrived at the tree edith stopped me and I turned to her. Her back was to the Sharpe's while I could see everything they did. \"Do not be like father, Lina.\" I looked back at Edith. \" I know father told you about his suspicions\" I crossed my arms and pouted. \"How do you know?\" Edith's hands were on her waist, narrowing her eyes at me. \" for one thing, you are taking your defensive stance. Crossing your arms and all.\" I looked down at my arms and dropped them to my side. She knew me so well. \"And second thing, you are analyzing them. Trying to find something wrong with them.\" I could see Thomas and Lucille arguing in the background. Their lips and hands moving rapidly. I sighed softly, scratching the back of my neck. \"You can tell?\" I could feel eyes on me, so I looked up and saw Thomas starting at me. Our eyes met and it was as if they were glued together. \"Of course I can tell! I am your sister , after all. Older sister.\" I turned to her, my lips in a pout. It seemed like she wasn't aware what was going on with Thomas and I...I knew she had her head in the clouds but she could usually be more observant. I threw my hands in the air. \"By ten minutes!\" I exhaled, rubbing my forehead. \"...fine. I'll be nicer and stop analyzing them.\" When I saw Edith's triumphant expression I pointed at her, my eyes narrowing. \"That does not mean I like them! Father was right, there is something wrong with them.\" Edith stepped towards me, her eyes big and round. \"Leave it please...he is my suitor...the only suitor I have ever had...please?\" I stepped back, staring at her. I hated when she used those dang puppy eyes. \"Fine.\" I grabbed her arm and made our way to Thomas and Lucille. I smiled softly at them, my expression the same as the one I used with lady McMichael and everyone else. \"I apologize for my ride behavior. I am still tired from the long trip, I did not get much sleep.\" Thomas stepped forward, his mouth pulling down in one side. He was trying hard not to frown. \"No, it is fine. We understand.\" Edith let go of my arm and latched on to Thomas's. I could feel my chest constrict and I mentally yelled at myself. I would not do anything. He was edith's, after all. \"Edith told me you are courting her?\" I could feel my chest constrict again when he stared at me, his eyes trying to convey something...but I was never very good at speaking the language of the eyes. \"...yes\" Thomas seemed to hesitate as he spoke. His eyes never leaving mine. I smiled brightly, closing my eyes. \"well, just so you know, as her sister-\" I stopped, exhaling, when Edith coughed lightly. \"As her...YOUNGER sister...by like ten minutes, might I add\" I said, glaring at Edith. \"You will have to get my blessing, along with my fathers.\" I could see Thomas smiling in amusement, doubting I would do anything to him, I bet. \"We are twins, after all. I will also like costing rights...if you do get our blessing.\" Thomas froze and Lucille was the one to step forward, her face with fake concern. \" our home is in London...I do not think you will like to travel so much...it is a long way, after all.\" I turned to her, smiling prettily. \" if your brother wants to marry my sister, the you get my presence. After all...you, Thomas's sister, will be near them...so why can't i, Edith's TWIN sister, visit?\" We stared at each other, a battle going on with our eyes...I could see her face twitching in annoyance...and I knew I had her. This would be extremely fun. A.N: SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?[Chapter 3] DISCLAIMER: I do not own Crimson Peak, plot or its characters. I tried to get everything checked out, I might have missed a few things though. REVIEWS: Thank you so much those of you who reviewed, Faved, added to alerts and to those of you who read my story! I really appreciate it! : ) Chels: Thank you so much! TheRealTAylor13: thank you for reviewing! I'll try to update quicker! RiveroftheWolf: first of all, love the name! And second, sorry about that! I was in a hurry to post the last chapter so I didn't really go back and check it, but I promise I'll try to check for mistakes. Laura201112: Tahnk you! Hope youlike this chapter! Belladu57: Thank you! VillainousWriter: Yes, this is a ThomasXoc story, I promise! mm, I liked the movie too. There was one part that bothered me, I couldn't really get into it afterwards, which was the incest part. I mean I KNEW there was some reference to it but i thought it would have been implied instead of out right showing it. Lol. I think she kinda lost her strong character and her common sense because of her losing her father, her only stability in her life had disappeared, and then on top of that she moved to a completely different place where she really had to rely on Lucille and Thomas to help her out. That was my thought on it, at least...I would probably be the same way if I was taken to a different place and lost everything. : ) Anyways, I'm glad you like my OC! and thank you! Guest: Thank you! Mm, I'll try to have more confrontations between them! Amelilia: Thank you! I'm glad you love it! I'll try to update sooner! Thank you so much for all that! I hope all of you like this chapter. Also! Maybe you guys can help me out, I only watched the movie once so some of the scenes have kinda been forgotten, so if you guys remember any of the scenes that you like (even if they are really small) I would like for you guys to let me know in a PM and I'll write them into the story! Let me know! We stared at each other, a battle going on with our eyes...I could see her face twitching in annoyance...and I knew I had her. This would be extremely fun. ... \"...Of course.\" I smiled in triumph! She was way too easy! \"Great!\" I clapped my hands and smiled brightly at her, I knew she could tell it was really a smirk in disguise. \"I am glad we agree.\" \"So!\" I turned to Edith, tilting my head to the side, ready for whatever she had to say. And no, it really wasn't because I didn't want to face or look at Sir Thomas. \"Lina, what did Lady McMichael want?\" Hm...what DID she say? It was all a blur to be honest...\"Oh...you know..\" I thought hard, trying to remember. When I did I clapped my hands together once. \"OH! She wanted to know how my trip was and...\" I stopped...now REALLY remembering how the conversation had ended. \"...\" I couldn't speak. I probably looked like a fish out of water with the way my mouth kept opening and closing. Edith stepped forward, touching my arm in concern. \"Lina?\" I could see Thomas and Edith looking at me with worry, for my health probably, but Lucille looked worried...probably asking herself if I was mentally stable. \"Lina? What is it?\" I covered my face. \"I think...I think I agreed to a courtship with Alan...\" I peaked at Edith between my fingers when she didn't answer. That evil person was covering her mouth...trying not to laugh at me! \"She finally got you!\" Edith spoke between her fingers. I groaned and fell on my knees, hugging my stomach. \"I was trying to get away from her! \" I looked up and could see Lucille giving me the evil eye, Thomas...well...his face had gone blank, he wasn't even looking at me, and Edith was shaking her head. \"I was only trying to see my sister...She cornered me...she knew I couldn't say no...she knew I wasn't paying attention.\" I covered my face with my hands again. \"Why me?\" Edith laughed quietly, helping me off the ground. \"Well...at least you are being courted now. Father will be happy.\" I narrowed my eyes, pulling my arm away from her evil touch. \"He spoke to me about this...I think they planned it all along...\" I sighed...exhausted from all of my acting. Maybe I should cut it shorter next time. \"You act...\" We all looked at Thomas, surprised that he had spoken. He had been very quiet after my little announcement. \"You act very...young for your age, Lady Iliana.\" I couldn't tell what he was feeling...his face was still blank...and he STILL wasn't looking at me. It looked like he was staring either at my nose or cheek. I smiled brightly. \"Ah! He speaks. \" I laughed brightly, ignoring the feeling in my stomach, I wouldn't care if I seemed like I was laughing AT him. \" I was beginning to think I had imagined you speaking earlier.\" My breath caught in my throat when Thomas's neck and cheeks became pink. He was blushing...I wonder where it starts-no, I won't think of that! I shook my head,paying attention to what he was saying. \"I am sorry. I was merely lost in thought.\" I could tell my smile looked fake now. \"It is fine. I and joking with you.\" There was a strong breeze, blowing my hair around my face. Now I remembered why every female put their hair up in buns. I tried to get it away, fighting with it, really. \"If that was your polite of saying I am immature, then yes. I completely agree. But...\" I stopped fighting with my hair, letting it stay where it was. At least I could see. \"But who wants to be an adult all of the time I believe people should act more like children from time to time, that way we don't get so stressed out or angry.\" Lucille crossed her arms over her chest, looking to the side. \"I see...But wouldn't that make people see you as immature?\" Thomas finally met my eyes, his eyes filled with curiosity. He looked so young at that moment. Like a child asking an adult why the sky was blue. I smiled kindly, a real smile for the first time...at least directed towards him that day. \"...Mm...well...I only act immature while I am with family or in front of people who I am close with, like you two, you will be family after all. \" Thomas flinched, looking away when Edith put her arm through his. \"Infront of everyone else, I act composed, serious, and very lady-like.\" I snorted, running through my messy hair. \" Why do you think Lady McMichael likes ME and not Edith? I am good at acting.\" Lucille turned towards me then, both Thomas and she staring at me with an expressionless look. \"I am glad she does not like me, thank you.\" Edith smiled at my narrowed eyes. \" Yes, very lucky, indeed.\" I was about to answer her with a sarcastic response when I looked over her shoulder and saw someone making their way towards us. I turned quickly to the three and fake yawned. \" Uh...I better go home and take a nap! I can feel the exhaustion taking over ...It was very...\" I picked up my skirts, making it easier to run away. \"Nice to meet you two. Good-bye, don't stay out too late sister dear.\" I turned around about to make my escape. \"Iliana! Wait right there!\" I froze, the shout making people turn towards us and whisper behind their hands and fans. I dropped my skirt and sighed. \"oh no...\" I could hear Edith laughing behind me. I put on a happy smile and turned towards the person. \"Hello, Alan dear. Lovely evening, is it not?\" Alan glared at me. \"We need to speak.\" I linked my fingers together, my hands in front of me, laying neatly on my skirts. \"Of course, dear sir. But you see, I have been on a long journey...and I only came here to say hello to my dear sister and the Sharpes...Which by the way, Sir Thomas is COURTING my sister, so now I need to take a nap.\" I tried to act innocently, tried being the key word, one of the few people I couldn't fool in this place was Alan. \"It will only take a second.\" His voice was hard but suddenly became soft, his features softening as he looked at Edith. He had it hard...he would never admit it now, though. Poor boy. \"Hello, Edith.\" He nodded to Thomas and Lucille. \"Hello, Sir Thomas. Lady Lucille.\" All three spoke at the same time, making me flinch. \"If you will excuse us.\" Alan looked my arm through his, pulling me away. 3RD POV All three watched Lina and Alan leave, Lina trying to pull her arm away from Alan, both arguing quietly. Thomas's hand clenched, watching them walk away. Lucille seeing the reaction frowned, not liking what she was noticing. Still looking at Thomas, Lucille spoke to Edith, her voice with a hint of curiosity. \"They make a good pair.\" Thomas's cheek twitched, finally looking away from Iliana and Alan. Edith laughed. \"Yes, they do. They have always been very close. The three of are childhood friends...but they were always closer.\" Edith looked after them with a longing expression. \"They will make a good match...everyone thinks so.\" Thomas's eyes narrowed, almost as if saying 'over my dead body.' ILIANA'S POV I could feel the heavy feeling fall off of my body. The tension leaving more and more as we walked away from the group. There was something going on. I could feel Alan's eyes on me but I let him speak his mind. I needed to sort my thoughts...I couldn't pay attention to what he was saying. \"I know that expression...what is it?\" I looked over our shoulders, watching them as they walked further and further away. \"I don't like them...\" I turned to Alan, a worried expression on my face. I wouldn't hide from him, I never had before...so why now? He was like my older brother that I never had. He always had been. \"My father was right...there is something wrong with them.\" Alan stopped walking, pulling me to a stop. \"Do you feel something?\" I ran my fingers through my hair. \"That's not it...\" I looked back at the group. \"You know how rash I can be-\" Alan interrupted, smirking at me. \"Of course.\" I smacked his arm, smiling softly. \"...I...When I get this...feeling...\" I ran my hand through my hair, feeling frustrated that I could explain what I was feeling. \" \"You know what I mean...when I get this weird sensation around people...I tend to follow them around.\" I interrupted Alan when he opened his mouth to chastise me. \" I know, very thoughtless of me. Anyways, I tend to follow the person around, to see what the feeling is...\" This time Alan hit the top of my head lightly, his face in disapproval. \"Curiosity killed the cat, Lina.\" I smiled. \"Satisfaction brought it back, Alan...plus the cat has nine lives.\" I shook my head, getting back on track. \"While I was away...I met this person who...I got a weird feeling around this person.\" I tilted my head. \"So...naturally...I tried to get as close to this person as I could. One minute this person was trying to court me...and then the next...he's not interested anymore...\" Alan stepped towards me, holding my arms, concern all over his face. \"What happened?\" I sighed, looking down. \"I don't know. I told him some of my life story, the simple stuff, you know? Like, I had a father and an older sister and that I was a seamstress, I owned a little shop that was all mine...but after opening up...something made him just...leave.\" Alan held on to my hands. \"It is his loss, then, Lina. Anyone would be lucky to have you...even me.\" We both flinched, remembering what our parents were doing. \"what does this have to do with what is going on now?\" I looked to the group again, noticing that Lucille was leaving, and Thomas and Edith were speaking. Thomas could probably feel my eyes on him because he looked up as Edith spoke and we stared at each other, not wanting to break contact. \"That man...that was him...\" I flinched, turning to Alan. \"...Sir Thomas Sharpe.\" My voice was barely a whisper. Alan froze, his mouth opening in shock. I could feel when his shock turned to anger, his whole body began to shake. I began speaking again, trying to draw his mind away from his anger. \"Something...I got a very bad feeling...I chalked it up to HIM leaving me...but...it got worse.\" I rubbed my arms, feeling cold from fear or from the cold, I didn't know. \"So much worse, that I hopped on the the next boat and came back home. That feeling that I got around him...was a very small part of the feeling I got that had made me come back...something is wrong, Alan...\" I looked at Lucille, noticing she and gone to the dead butterflies. \"But...I could almost feel myself choking when I was near HER.\" I pointed with my head, not wanting to drop my arms from giving me some heat. Alan looked towards Lucille, and back to me, frowning. \"So you think there is something wrong with both of them?\" I shook my head, when I noticed Thomas turning his head to me, I turned back to Alan. \"The feeling I got from HIM...pales in comparison to the feeling I got from Lucille...I think whatever Lucille is...some of it transferred to Thomas...I don't think he's bad...I think it's all HER.\" Alan turned to look at Edith, a sense of longing in the way he was looking at her. I touched his arm, drawing his eyes back to me. \"You know I will protect her, right? She's my sister...I will keep her safe.\" Alan nodded, putting his forehead against mine. \"I know...I just hope you know what you are getting yourself into. And I hope you know I am here to help you and Edith.\" I nodded, smiling happily at him. That is why we were best friends. He never judged me. He was my best friend, my brother I never had. Late at night, I sat in front of my mirror in my room. Mary, our family maid, was brushing my hair, something that she loved to do for some strange reason. You have such beautiful hair, Lady Iliana.\" I glared at her through the mirror. \"Mary.\" Mary smiled crookedly at me, hiding behind my hair. \"Oh, sorry. Lady Lina...Better?\" I smiled, nodding my head. \"Much, thank you. I wonder what Edith is doing?\" I stood up and walked to the nightgown on my bed. It was a long white thin dress, my arms and some of my upper chest showing...it was very scandalous but I had made it, watching the fashion of different countries. I put it on and left my hair down again. Mary folded my clothes and put them away. \"MM...I think she was in the parlor, last time I saw her.\" I smiled, walking happily towards the door. \"I think I shall go visit her then. She must be bored without me.\" I smirked, hearing Mary sigh. \"Will you at least put on your robe?\" I shook my head, pouting at her. \"No, this is my house. I can walk around nude if I like!\" I began to walk away again and head Mary grab something before following me. \"Lina stop acting like a child, what if there are guests?\" I turned to her, walking backwards. \"They will get a free show, then.\" I turned back around when I got to the stairs. \"Iliana!\" Mary walked faster, trying to reach me. I stopped at the middle stair, \"Your mother always tried to stop me from doing bad things, I never listened to her, and she was like a mother to me\" I turned to her, smirking widely. \"What makes you think I'll listen to you?\" Mary groaned loudly, smacking her face lightly. \"Fine, but it will be on YOUR head, Iliana.\" I laughed, continuing to walk. \"Isn't it always?\" I made my way towards the parlor. \"Oh, sister! What are you doing...\" I froze when I got into the parlor, making Mary run into my back. There...on the couch...was Edith, Thomas and Lucille. They were all opening staring at me with shock. Thomas and Lucille's face red, either from anger or embarrassment, i don't' know but all I did know was that Thomas's face was a brighter red and looking up and down my body. I turned to Edith, seeing her hand on her face. \"I am with guests, Lina.\" I laughed nervously, hugging myself, trying to hide my body from Thomas's eyes. \"Oops?\" I could hear Mary whispering behind me, her voice filled with laughter. \"I told you...\" I glared at her over my shoulder until she put on my robe on me. So that's what she had grabbed. \"I brought it just in case...THIS happened.\" I smiled. \"Thank you. This is why you are my favorite, Mary. What would I do without you?\" Mary deadpanned, crossing her arms over her chest. \"I don't know...walk around nude?\" I smiled nervously again. \"...Right...\" I nodded a thank you and turned to the group. Lucille stood up, her arm on her waist. \"you let your servants speak to you like that?\" She sounded disgusted, her eyes glaring at Mary. Poor Mary dropped her gaze to the floor and I stood in front of her, shielding her from Lucille's line of vision. \"She is not a servant, Lady Lucille. She is family.\" Lucille scoffed crossing her arms over her chest. \"She is your father's employee. She is a mere servant.\" Thomas stood up, putting a hand on Lucille's arm, his eyes narrowed at her. I didn't pay attention to that, though, my whole attention was on Lucille. \"Her mother raised Edith and I, so she is family. Right, Edith?\" Edith nodded, walking a few steps towards me and Mary. \"I would suggest you stop looking at Mary like that, Lady Lucille. Before I am forced to escort you out.\" I could feel Mary's hand on my back, clutching on to my robe. Lucille smiled mockingly at me. \"But I am to be your family, soon. And you do not treat family badly...right?\" I could see the smirk trying to break free from her lips. I smirked first, taking a step towards her,menacingly. \"You are right, she has been a part of MY own family since we were soon...but you are NOT family yet...there is still a chance you will NOT be, in fact, family...\" I turned to Thomas, not looking him in the eyes, instead looking at him on his forehead. \"You are losing your chance to have my approval, Sir Thomas, thanks to your sister, just so you know. I would suggest controlling her.\" Lucille tried to take a step towards me but Thomas stepped in front of her, blocking her view of us. \"I apologize, Lady Iliana.\" Lucille fell back to the couch, sitting down angrily. It seemed that Thomas had pushed her to sit down. \"I swear my sister will not act like that again.\" I glared through Thomas's stomach, almost as if I could see her eyes. \"Can you really swear that?\" Thomas flinched, dropping his eyes. Edith shifted from foot to foot nervously besides me. And that's when all hell broke lose. Our father walked in, stopping to my left. \"What is going on here?\" Everyone froze. I softened my expression after my shock of not hearing him come in. \"Nothing father.\" I turned to him, not noticing how my robe had fallen open when I didn't hold on to it. My father's face reddened with anger. \"You DARE walk around like that? With guests in our home?\" I looked down quickly. \"Close that robe, Iliana! This instant! You are not a child anymore! Act your age!\" I flinched, closing my robe tightly. \"Yes, father.\" I whispered, looking down. \"And YOU.\" I looked up, seeing how my father was glaring at a scared Mary. \"You could not stop her from coming down here like that?\" I stepped in front of her again. \"Father, it was my-\" Father interrupted me, raising his hand. I flinched walking backwards, running into Mary. \"Be quiet, Iliana. \" He turned to Mary again. \"I will be speaking with your mother later. I can not punish you because I respect your mother, but I will make sure that she does. Is that understood?\" Mary nodded quietly. I felt awful. But I would fix this. Mary's mother wouldn't hurt her if I asked her not to. She knew how I was, she knew her daughter couldn't stop me from doing something reckless. Father turned to Edith next. \"Why are they here?\" I could see Edith playing with her hands nervously. \"We...we went to the park today...and we decided to come back here for a rest.\" I kept my gaze down, I could feel Thomas's stare but I couldn't face him. Or Lucille...they were probably laughing at our scolding. I saw a pair of shoes, Thomas's shoes, take a step towards us. He tried to reason with father, trying to get the scolding down. \"Sir, it was our fau-\" Father raised his hand, motioning Thomas to stop speaking. \"I do not know how you behave in your home, Sir Thomas. But HERE, in my home, I do not let men visit my daughters, without me being present, even if you have your sister with you. Edith would not be able to tell you no, when you asked to come here, so I understand. But I do have a daughter who seems she undisciplined...\" I flinched. \"so I would like you to ask me next time you come over.\" Thomas looked towards me, noticing my flinch. \"Yes, sir. We will go now...\" He looked at Edith. \"Good night, lady Edith.\" And then looked at me, he opened his mouth to say something but I turned my head away, already heading to the stairs. \"Good night, sir.\" Father stared after me, his eyes narrowing. \"Good night.\" When I reached my room, I heard the front door close. I sighed in relief. I could finally breath again. SO WHAT DID YOU THINK? YAY OR NAY ? -ILIAH-[Chapter 4] A.N.: WOW! So many reviews, alerts, favorites and hits! I'm so happy!

I'm glad you think its getting better! I will never forget that part! That was my favorite part...I laughed very loudly at that scene. Thank you so much! A FEW THINGS BEFORE WE START: i CHANGED A FEW THINGS IN THIS CHAPTER BECAUSE i FORGOT THE ORDER THAT THINGS HAPPENED. WHEN I DID REMEMBER, IT HAD BEEN TOO LATE. I COULDN'T REALLY CHANGE THEM BACK. ALSO, I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER THE EXACT LINES THAT THEY USED, SO MINE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIES...BUT I THINK THEY HAVE SOME OF THE SAME MEANING? SORRY ABOUT THAT! I SHOULD GO WATCH IT AGAIN! \"When I reached my room, I heard the front door close. I sighed in relief, I could finally breathe again.\" \"...\" I sat up in bed, breathing rapidly. I swear I had heard a noise. I looked around my room, the only light coming from the moon, which wasn't much. My door was closed, there was nothing in here. \"...\" I heard the same noise and got out of bed. \"Hello?\" \"...Come...\" I looked around the room again, getting on my knees to look under the bed when I didn't see anything again. I got up and walked towards the door, my body shaking in fear. This had to be a dream...right? \"Hello?...Who's there?...Show yourself!\" I could feel myself getting irritated with whatever that thing was. \"Come...me...\" I walked out of my room, going down the stairs and to the door, following the voice. \"Who is there?\" \"Come...to me...\" I growled under my breath, but when I opened the door my breath stopped. I thought I had opened the door...I looked back at the door and saw that the door was gone...everywhere around me...it looked like a graveyard... \"Iliah...my precious...Iliah...\" I turned to the voice and froze in shock. That name...there was only one person who ever called me that. \"Mother?\" \"Come Iliah...\" I couldn't believe it, it couldn't be her. She was long dead...but this...this had to be a dream. She couldn't be here in the living world. I could feel the tears running down my face and took a step forward. \"Momma?\" \"Beware...of Crimson Peak...Beware of...Evil...\" I continued walking, following the voice. \"Beware of what?...What is Crimson Peak?\" I tripped over something, catching myself before falling on my face. \"Mom, where are you?\" \"Beware...\" Her voice drifted off, fading away with the breeze...instead another voice took over. \"Wake...Wake up...Iliana...wake up!\" I gasped, opening my eyes. When had I closed them? I was still standing...and in front of a lake...but there were no lakes near our house. \"where am I?\" My voice coming out in a whisper, not really understanding anything that was going on. \"Iliana..\" I turned to the voice and found Thomas looking at me with concern. When did he get here? \"You are near the lake outside of the hotel...what are you doing all the way out here?\" Thomas rubbed my arms, trying to get me to warm up. I was only in my nightgown. I looked around in a daze. \"I...don't know...\" I tried to remember what my mother had said...something about Crimson Peak...but what was Crimson Peak? \"Beware...\" I mumbled, my lips frozen from the cold. Thomas sighed taking off his jacket and wrapping it around me. \"I did not know you slept walked...\" I pulled the jacket tighter around my body. \"THere are many things you do not know about me, sir.\" I pulled my hand out of the jacket and rubbed my face, I couldn't feel it anymore. The wind was making it numb. Thomas flinched, running his hand through his lovely black hair. \" I...I am sorry...so very sorry.\" I looked at him, my body wanting nothing more than to step forward and hug him, to help him get rid of that pain I could see. \"about?\" I asked, hugging myself tighter to stop myself from reaching out to him. Thomas began to pace, walking back and forth in front of me, it was making me dizzy. \"I did not want to hurt you, that is why I left...\" he motioned with his hands, moving them rapidly. \"You were the first to act differently towards me...you did not care when I told you I had little to my name...\" He walked to my, holding onto my shoulders. \"You were a bright sun in my endless night sky...\" We stared at each other in silence for a while, I didn't want to give in. I didn't want to let him win...that's when it clicked, what he had said. I took a step back, feeling the panic begin. \"Hurt me?...Are you going to hurt Edith?\" Thomas laughed forcefully, making it very clear that it was fake. \"Out of everything I said...\" He scoffed. \"Of course you would pick up on that.\" I grabbed his arms, trying to get his attention back on me. \"Are you going to hurt Edith?\" My anger was rising. He had never seen me angry, but oh boy was he about to experience it. Thomas looked at my hands, a sad expression on his face. \"Not me...\" I nodded slowly, letting go of his arms. \"Lucille then...I knew there was something wrong with her.\" Before I could completely let go, Thomas held on to my hands, pulling me closer to him. \"But it was my choice. I chose Edith...she told me she was too young...I did not listen.\" I looked up at him, hearing his voice catch...of course...he was in love with her. I made a shooing motion with my hand, looking away. I did not want to see his love sick look, not when it was for my sister. \"It is fine. No-one can choose who they fall in love with. Edith has always had that reaction from men.\" I felt myself being turned towards Thomas forcefully, his hands on my arms again. I looked up to his face and gasped. He looked angry. \"NO. I do not love Edith.\" I gasped again, but he had that expression, if he did not love Edith then who did he love? \"I came here and chose her because I thought she was an only child...If I had known she was YOUR sister...I would have NEVER chosen her!\" I tilted my head in confusion, his hand coming up to touch my cheek tenderly. \" I love YOU, Iliana.\" I could feel my eyes widen, his face coming closer and closer to mine. I couldn't move. My body had frozen, even as his lips made contact with mine. They were soft, barely touching. \"I. Love. You...from the very beginning.\" He moved his face away, enough for me to see him clearly. \"Do you remember?\" I stretched my arms over my head, feeling the chilly breeze from London. This place was beautiful. \"Lady Iliana!\" I turned behind me, seeing my maid Mandy running out of the hotel, my umbrella in her hands. \"You forgot your umbrella. It looks like it will rain later.\" I smiled brightly. \"Thank you, Mandy. Would you like to accompany me? I am going to go sight seeing.\" I asked her, knowing that Mandy was a very curious little girl. Mandy nodded her head vigorously and I laughed. \"Come then! Let's go on an adventure.\" Mandy's face turned bright red, she lowered her head, looking at the ground. \"T-thank you. Lady Iliana.\" I smiled down at her, patting her head softly. We continued to walk until we made it to a beautiful lake, there were people everywhere. \"London is very beautiful, isn't it miss?\" Mandy asked, her voice full of awe with the image that was in front of us. I nodded looking around. \"It is...isn't it?\" I turned to my left, feeling a weird sensation and noticed a man make eye contact with me. He was beautiful. He wore a black suit, his black hair neatly combed back. Mandy gasped beside me, noticing the man looking at me. \"My lady...that man is staring at you...\" She giggled behind her hand. \"He is very good looking.\" I could feel the weird sensation getting stronger as he walked towards us but when I looked into his beautiful blue-green eyes I forgot everything. I couldn't think straight. \"Very.\" \"Hello.\" His voice was smooth like silk yet very masculine. He bowed at the waist and smiled kindly at me. \"My name is Thomas Sharpe.\" I smiled shyly, curtsying. \"Hello, Mr. Sharpe. I am Iliana Cushing.\" I extended my hand and he kissed it softly, his touch sending shivers down my back. And by the look of it...he felt it too. \"I do remember. Even back then..\" I could feel my eyes narrow at him. \"Even back then there was something wrong...Your eyes deceived me, though...\" I began to breathe heavily in anger. \"Chose her for what?\" Thomas looked away with a pained expression. Now I was the one that began to pace. \"If you chose Edith for something...that means that you CHOSE me, when you walked up to me then, too.\" I turned to him. \"What. Did. You. Chose. Us. For, Thomas?\" He glanced at me before taking a step away, shaking his head. \" I chose you at the beginning but after we got to know each other...I didn't want that for you. So I left!\" I was angry. He was beating around the bush, I wanted to know what he had planned. I didn't care about anything else. I pushed him back. \"What did you chose us for?! Answer me!\" Thomas flinched, grabbing my arms to stop me from hitting him more. \"We...we were trying to make something to help us build a road, in our home...we need-\" I laughed in disbelief, my breathing getting wilder. \"Money...You are building an invention and you need MONEY...what better way to get it than by marrying wealth?\" I laughed loudly, trying to hide from the fact that my heart was breaking, I blinked tears away. \"When I told you I had a sister...That I wasn't an only child...that all my father's money would go to my sister because she was older...you couldn't use me anymore. Because EDITH WAS OLDER...she would get our father's inheritance...while I have to get married and get any of their inheritance...\" When I tried to pull away Thomas held on to my arms, stopping me from getting away. He brought his face closer to mine, his eyes pleading with me. \" I was going to marry someone here...get their inheritance and then look for you.\" I tried to pull away. \"I would finally get some money to start my inventions...and I could sell that invention, making enough money to start a family. A family with you! I could finally marry you!\" I stopped fighting, blinking back tears. \"And what would happen to that person you married?...To Edith?\" Thomas gulped, his hold on my arm tightening painfully. \"Lucille...Lucille would take care of her.\" I stared at him with shock. \"NO!\" I finally pulled my arm out of his hold, with enough force that it made me trip and fall on my back. \"I will not let you go through with this!\" I stood up quickly, throwing his jacket at him in anger. \"You will NEVER marry Edith! Go look elsewhere because you are THROUGH here!\" I turned my back to him and began walking home. I couldn't even feel the cold anymore, my body was burning up with anger. \"Iliana!...Lina! Stop!\" I ignored him, walking angrily away. \"Let me at least take you back home. There could be something dangerous out there!\" I turned my head to look at him over my shoulder, yelling back angrily. \"There is something dangerous right HERE!\" (3rd pov) Thomas looked after Iliana, watching as she walked away angrily. \"Thomas.\" Thomas looked behind him and saw Lucille in her nightgown, hugging her arms, trying to get rid of the cold. Thomas turned back to watching the speck that was Iliana's retreating back. \"We need to get rid of her...\"Lucille stepped behind Thomas's back, hugging him tightly. \"She will ruin everything.\" Thomas shook his head, not really paying attention to what Lucille was saying. \" We can start over. Somewhere else.\" Lucille tightened her arms around Thomas. \"But you have won Edith over. We only need to get rid of her father and Iliana. Then she will marry you!\" Thomas grabbed her arms and threw them away from him, Lucille took a step away from the force. \"I said NO! We are not harming Iliana!\" Lucille's eyes got teary. \"Why not? Ever since that day...when you kept disappearing for hours...there is a different light in your eyes...\" Lucille sobbed. \"It is true, then? You are doing all of this for HER, instead of for US, like we had planned. She does not want you, thomas!\" Lucille hit Thomas's chest. \"She hates you!\" Thomas shook his head, looking down at Lucille sadly. \"I know she feels the same for me, Lucille. I am sorry. You will always be family, there will always be a place in heart for you...but she has my mind, my body and my heart in her grasp. I WILL marry her.\" Thomas turned away, walking away from a still sobbing Lucille. Lucille's hands clenched, her tears drying up. \"We will see about that.\" (Lina's pov) I woke up in the morning with an empty feeling. I didn't care about anything else, I had a mission. I walked to my father's study and knocked. \"Come in.\" I opened the door and stepped in, seeing my father sitting in his desk. \"Good morning, Father.\" Father turned his face to me and frowned, seeing me in my robe. \"Good morning, Iliana. Haven't you gotten ready for the feast?\" I walked towards the desk and sat in the chair. \"I will father...I have just...I wanted to ask something of you.\" I hesitated seeing him frown at me. He motioned for me to continue but when I hesitated again he sat forward, his hands together on the desk. \"You have never asked anything of me before. What is it?\" I opened my mouth and closed it again. I could do this. I could ask this of him. He was a smart man. \"i want you to stop Sir Sharpe from courting Edith.\" I held my breath. Father stood up and walked to my side, sitting on the desk in front of me. \"Why?\" He crossed his arms over his chest, narrowing his eyes at me. I took a deep breath, cleaning the sweat from my hands on my dress. \" There is something wrong with the Sharpe's...I don't like them...I don't trust them.\" Father stared at me, trying to find something. He seemed to find it because he walked to where his alcohol was and took a drink. \"It seems that you inherited your mother's ability to sense things...I should have known with the way you acted last night.\" Father sighed heavily, grabbing a folder from his desk. \"I should have listened to you more often. \" father handed me the folder and I opened it up. \"What is it?\" I took out the papers when father motioned for me to look at them. When I did, I opened my mouth in shock. \"He...He is married?\" I looked at father. His face was grim, rubbing his hand on his face. \"His wife has passed away...but he WAS married.\" I looked down at the paper and looked at the date. I could feel my hands shaking. \"This was four months ago...\" Oh god...he was still married when he was speaking to me...his wife had died a few days before he left me! \"He will be coming tonight for the party. I will speak to them then.\" I looked at father, noticing how tired he looked. This must be hell for him. Edith had finally found someone she had liked...and he turned out to be evil. I stood up. \"I would like to be here when you do...I don't trust them.\" Father stared at my blank expression and nodded. \"Of course...go, get ready.\" I dropped the folder back on his desk and walked away. \"And Iliana...\" His voice was hesitant, so I turned to him. He walked to me and stopped, touching my cheek lightly. \" I am sorry. For how I have always treated you. I do not think you are undisciplined...I do not hate your childishness...You just remind me so much of your mother.\" I blinked back tears, not believing what I was hearing. \"I do pay attention to you...I just...do not know how to show you that I have. Edith is easy to please...but you have always been more free...you have always been able to take care of yourself.\" I sniffed, blinking the tears away. Only making them run down my face. \"Father.\" Father leaned towards me, kissing my forehead. \"Oh!\" Father walked towards his desk and brought out another folder, telling me to get it. \"Sign these.\" I stepped to the desk and signed the papers, not reading what they were, trusting my father. \"What are they for?\" I asked, signing them. Father smiled kindly. \"I trust you, Iliana. Those papers are my will.\" I turned to him, my neck hurting from how fast I had turned. \"I have changed it to where everything will belong to you, not Edith.\" My eyes grew in shock. \"She has expressed her distaste about owning the money and the business...and I truly trust you to make the right decisions. If something were to happen to me...I would like the business to be in good hands.\" I looked like a fish again. I didn't know what to say. So I asked the first thing that popped into my head. \"And...this has nothing to do with Edith's want to marry Sir Sharpe?\" Father sat in his chair, his chin covered by his fists. \"NO, those papers state that the business and money will go to you. Whoever you marry will never see a cent or part of the business...not unless you say otherwise.\" I leaned against the desk on my hands, my body losing its will to stand up. \"You can do that?\" I asked breathlessly. \"I work at the bank.\" I laughed quietly, seeing his smirk. \"I can make anything happen. And you own a small business...\" He shrugged. \"That convinced the others that you can own a business.\" I laughed, shaking my head, I was feeling very dizzy. \"Go, get ready.\" I nodded and left the study, making my way to my room. As I walked into the room I saw Helen and Mary fixing my things for tonight. They looked up and Helen made her way quickly to me. \"Child...\" She held on to my shoulders and led me to the bed, Mary following with a concerned expression. \"Are you alright? You look as if you've seen a ghost.\" She felt my forehead. \"You are very pale.\" I laughed quietly, hiding my face in my hands. \"I think...I think my father just apologized for everything...and gave me his company...\" Both gasped, hands to mouth. \"Hat is great news, child!\" Helen hugged me tightly, smiling brightly allowing her wrinkles to be seen more clearly. I mumbled into my hands, loud enough for Helen to hear me. \"Pinch me, Helen...I believe this is a dream.\" I felt a pinch on my right and jumped. \"OUCH!\" I rubbed my arm and glared at Mary. Mary shrugged. \"You asked to be pinched.\" I pointed at Helen. \"By your mother!\" I slapped Mary with a pillow. \"It doesn't hurt much when she does it!\" Helen shook her head, sighing in annoyance. \"Stop bickering, you two. \" Helen looked at me. \"Do you still believe this is a dream?\" I shook my head. \"Then Mary's pinch worked. Now let us get you ready for tonight!\" Helen turned to Mary hitting her shoulder lightly with a fan. \"Draw the bath, child!\" Later that night, when the guests were arriving I walked to my father's office and walked in, seeing Edith sigh in relief. \"She signed the papers, then?\" I smirked evilly, quietly walking behind her. \"I have.\" Edith jumped and turned to me, smacking my head with her fan. \"Iliana! Do not do that!\" I laughed loudly, trying to move away from Edith's fan. \"You are very skittish , sister!\" I could see father shaking his head, smiling faintly at us. \"She has signed them, Edith. Now go and enjoy the party. Edith laughed with me and we made our way to the door, but father stopped me. \"Iliana.\" ' I turned to father and saw another folder in his hands, I motioned for Edith to go ahead. \"wait for me outside, Edith.\" She nodded, leaving and I walked to the folder. Taking it from father I looked into the folder and froze. Father walked to my side. \"Four wives...\" His voice coming out in a whisper. I covered my mouth seeing the newspaper. \"All dead?\" This finally made it seem final in some way. Like this was the close to whatever doubts I had had about Thomas. Father nodded grimly, running his hand through his hair. \"Edith...\" Father and I turned to each other when we heard Thomas's voice and nodded. Father made his way to the door. \"I have come to speak to you...is there any place we may speak alone?\" I could see father standing by the door, a hand on Edith's shoulder. \"Actually.\" Edith and Thomas had turned to him, because Father's gaze went to somewhere near Edith's side. \"I would like to speak to you and your sister, Thomas.\" Edith turned her head to me and I shrugged. \"Go, enjoy the party, Edith.\" Thomas and Lucille walked into the room and stopped. \"We will be out in a few minutes.\" I could hear father reassure Edith. Thomas made his way to me, his eyes trying to catch mine but I kept my eyes on father. I leaned against the desk, crossing my arms over my chest. Thomas, finally realizing that he wasn't getting a response from me, turned to father. \"Is there something wrong?\" Father turned to his alcohol and took two drinks, giving one to Thomas and keeping the other one. \"I know you are courting my daughter, thomas. She seems very happy with it.\" He walked to the desk, picking up the folder and looking blankly at it. I turned to father and whispered quietly, not wanting them to hear. \"Don't mention the other one.\" Father looked at me and nodded quietly, moving away from the desk. \"I know our family does not have much money, sir-\" Lucille said, taking a step forward, when my father raised his hand to quiet her she stepped back again. \"I did not want you in here to speak to you about money...\" Father turned to Thomas. Thomas's eyes were on me, I could feel them. He took a deep breath, almost as if trying to get the strength to say something. \"Sir, I really-\" Father interrupted him again. \"I know. You have fallen in-love with my daughter.\" Thomas looked at me, his eyes soft. Nodding his head. \"Yes, I have. That is why I would like to ask you if I could-\" Father took a step forward. \"Marry her?\" Thomas, eyes never leaving mine, nodded. \"I have come here to formally ask your permission to marry Ilia-\" Lucille's hand shot out, squeezing Thomas's hand tightly. My eyes widened when I noticed the slip up and looked at father, hoping he hadn't heard it. And he hadn't. I stood up straight. \"You will have to understand why I say no to your request.\" Father gave the papers to Lucille and she read them, her eyes widening. \"I have come upon this bit of information.\" Lucille passed it to Thomas, allowing him to read it. They both looked shocked to read what was in those papers. \"So, my answer is no.\" Thomas took a step forward, his voice breaking with panic. \"But sir!\" Father narrowed his eyes taking out a small piece of paper. \"I know. You love my daughter...but I do not want you to marry her.\" Thomas turned to me, his eyes pleading. \"What would you like me to do then?\" His words having a double meaning that were directed towards me. I turned my head, looking back at father. Father signed the small paper and walked to Lucille again. \"End your courtship with Edith.\" Thomas looked confused at Father, not understanding that it wasn't me father was talking about, but Edith. \"I want you to break my daughter's heart and end the courtship. Understand? This should cover it.\" Lucille looked at the paper and widened her eyes. It was a check. Father was paying them so Thomas could leave Edith alone. Lucille and Thomas nodded their heads sadly. \"And tell her you are leaving. Going back to London. You are no longer welcomed in my town.\" Thomas looked up at me sharply. His eyes pleading. \"Understood?\" When I didn't say anything, Thomas nodded, running his hand through his hair angrily. \"Good. Let us go out now. Lina?\" I walked towards father and put my arm through his, following after Thomas and Lucille. THANK YOU FOR READING! HOW WAS IT? -LINA-[Chapter 5] AN; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING! THIS STORY IS A BIT SLOPPY...I KINDA DON'T FEEL WELL AND SO IT PROBABLY SHOWS IN THIS CHAPTER! THAT AND I WAS LISTENING TO PHANTOM OF THE OPERA WHILE I WROTE THIS...SO I WAS KINDA SORTA PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SONGS INSTEAD OF THIS STORY. SO I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. ITS A BIT SHORTER AS WELL SO...YEA. OH! AND IT HAVE SO MANY POV'S YOU MIGHT FEEL DIZZY! I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT I WILL DO REVIEW REPLIES IN THE NEXT CHAPTER! I PROMISE! THANK YOU FOR REVIEWING, EVERYONE WHO DID! ALSO! I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOU. I ALREADY SPOKE WITH SPARKY SHE-DEMON AND SHE GAVE ME HER INPUT BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. WHICH ONE WOULD BE BETTER? EITHER LINA GOING TO ALLERDALE HALL WITH THOMAS AND EDITH OR STAYING WITH ALAN AND THEN GOING WITH HIM TO RESCUE EDITH? WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK? LET ME KNOW! DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN CRIMSON PEAK OR ITS CHARACTER...OR PLOT LINE. I walked towards father and put my arm through his, following after Thomas and Lucille. The party had been a very interesting event. Watching Lucille and Thomas try to avoid Edith, who chased after them for the better part of the night, was very amusing. Not the fact that he would hurt Edith later tonight, but that he was trying to evade Edith and try to speak to me...who was trying to avoid him. Alan had decided to come at the last minute, spending most of the time with me, while his sister tried to get both of our attentions. I really didn't like his sister...but I couldn't be rude to her, knowing that their mother was just on the other side of the house. When dinner was ready we made our way to the table and sat down. Father sat at the head of the table, as Edith sat on his left and I sat on his right. Thomas and Lucille sat next to Edith and Alan sat next to me. It had gone very well. Everyone was enjoying the feast….and as it ended my father stood up and cleared his throat. \"Excuse me, everyone.\" Everyone turned to father, and I clenched my hands in my lap. \"It seems Sir Thomas has a very sad announcement to make.\" Everyone turned to Thomas, standing up as he did. \"Right….\" Thomas walked to Father's spot. \"Lucille and I would like to thank you all for how generous you have been to us, for welcoming us, complete strangers, with open arms. Sadly….Lucille and I have gotten homesick, so we will be returning home tomorrow morning. We will leave on the earliest train possible.\" I turned to Edith as I saw her flinch, and followed after her when she began to walk away. I could hear footsteps behind us, so I walked faster and tried to reach Edith first. But Thomas had longer legs, and he reached us before I could speak to Edit. \"Edith….\" Edith stopped on the stairs, not turning around. \"So you are leaving?\" Her voice was soft, fragile, she sounded like she wanted to cry and my heart broke. I wish I could take it back. If she really did love him so much….then I would give up any feelings I had for him, I would allow him to marry her….but he was not a good man. He would kill her if he had the chance. Thomas took a step up the stairs, and made his face blank. \"Yes. Lucille and I have gotten homesick….and since there is nothing holding us here, we thought we should leave.\" I could hear Edith's heart break. Edith choked on her sob before answering, her voice nothing but a whisper. It was hard to hear her and I had to strain myself to hear her. \"Nothing holding you here?\" When Thomas answered with a no, Edith nodded her head sadly. Beginning to make her way up the stairs again. \"Then have a safe journey back.\" I could hear footsteps behind us and I knew that everyone else had come into the room. Including my father, if Thomas looking over my shoulder glaring was any indication. \"Would you like to hear what I thought about your book?\" Edith stopped walking again, sniffing before she turned to him. \"Of course.\" I flinched, knowing what was about to happen. I closed my eyes and looked away. \"I thought your story lacked depth.\" Edith flinched. \"I thought it was very childish, women should only write about romance, not ghost stories.\" Edith began to cry now, not hiding the fact that she was. She whispered that it wasn't a ghost story, her hand covering her mouth. Thomas took a few more steps towards Edith, making him tower over her. \"Your story was childish, immature and idiotic.\" Thomas turned to me, his eyes hard. \"LIke your sister.\" I raised my chin in defiance, knowing that this was all an act. At that moment Edith raised her hand and slapped Thomas across the face. Her eyes dangerous with anger. \"How dare you?! My sister is not idiotic or immature or childish!\" Edith turned and ran up the stairs, slamming the door as she got into her room. I picked up my skirt and ran up the stairs, Thomas grabbing my arm as I ran past him. I turned to him, my eyes hard. Those eyes were drawing me in again, they were pulling me into where I would agree with anything that he said. \"Come with me. Leave this place, with me….Please.\" I could feel the tears running down my face as I tried to fight the pull that he had on. I would not fall for it a second time. Not again. I pulled my arm out of his hold and ran up the stairs and to Edith's room. I pressed my ear to the door and listened, hearing her quiet sobs coming from the other side. I sighed and knocked on the door. Hearing her sobs quiet down she called for me to come in. Opening the door I saw her laying on her bed, her body facing down, her head to the side to see me. I sighed quietly and closed the door, not wanting anyone to hear us or bother us. I walked to her bed and climbed in, laying beside her. I ran my hand through her hair like I always did when we were younger. It seemed to still work because she calmed down, only hiccuping. \"You were right….You are always right…\" Edith whispered, moving closer to me. Her sobs were muffled by the bed sheets. I pulled her towards me, her face hiding under my chin. \"Shh….it's fine. Everything will be fine now…\" Edith hugged me tighter, her arms tightly around my middle. \"It hurts...it hurts so much…\" I nodded my head, closing my eyes. \"I know it does...but it will get better as time goes by.\" Edith glanced at me, moving back enough to see my expression, her eyes filled with curiosity. \"Have you felt this pain?\" I smirked, hiding my own pain. \"Me? Broken heart?\" I laughed quietly, playing with her hair. \"I do the heart breaking, sister. You know this.\" My smirked slowly disappeared as she hid her face back under my chin, her voice soft, filled with sleep. \"You are right. Of course. Nothing can hurt you.\" Edith laughed quietly, her voice slurred with sleepiness. \"I wish I was as strong as you.\" I closed my eyes tightly, knowing when she had fallen asleep. \"No, you don't….\" There was only one person who had broken my heart...and that man was the same one that has broken yours. I could tell when the feeling began to creep in, taking over my body and freezing it. Something was wrong. Something horrible was about to happen. (3rd POV) The next morning Thomas arrived outside of the hotel at the same time as Lucille, both stopping to stare at each other. Lucille stepped forward, smiling softly. \"Thomas…\" Thomas narrowed his eyes, crossing his hands in front of his chest. \"Where have you been?\" Lucille began to fiddle with her hands, looking down at them. \"I….I went for a walk.\" Thomas kept staring at her trying to tell if she had lied or told the truth. When Lucille had had enough she looked up. \"Where were you?\" Thomas continued to stare at her for a few more seconds before answering, his voice filled with caution. \"I went to the lake.\" Lucilles hands clenched in anger before calming down. \"You...you should wait here for Iliana.\" Thomas looked at her sharply, taking a step forward. \"What?\" Lucille took a deep breath and smiled kindly. \"You should wait for her...Ask her to...to come with us to Allerdale Hall...maybe she will agree if you ask her one more time.\" Thomas opened and closed his mouth, not knowing exactly what was going on at the moment. \"Why...why are you saying this? I thought you hated her and Edith?\" Lucille shook her head slowly, looking around them. \"Because…. I love you…\" she stepped up to Thomas and touched his cheek lightly. \"I am doing all of THIS….because I love you.\" Thomas looked at her for a few seconds before smiling brightly and hugging her tightly, spinning her around in the air. \"I love you too, Lucille. I will go straight to their home now!\" Before Thomas could take a step Lucille grabbed his arm, making him turn back to her. \"NO!\" Thomas looked curiously at her. \"I...I delivered a letter this morning….telling her to meet us here. That is where I really was.\" Thomas smiled, holding Lucille's face between his hands and kissed her forehead. \"You did that?...For me?\" Thomas let go and looked at his pocket watch. \"I will wait for her in the lobby, then.\" Thomas turned and walked quickly inside. Leaving a smirking Lucille outside. \"I am doing this for you, dear Thomas.\" (iliana's pov) I walked quickly, covering my face and hair with my veil. I looked forward and sighed, hesitating before entering the building. I opened the doors to the church and stepped in. Closing them tightly behind me. After my morning chores I stepped into the house and pulled the veil off of my head, sighing with relief. I looked up when I heard quick footsteps running down the stairs. Edith looked angry. \"Edith?\" I asked, not knowing what was going on. Why she was angry. Edith stepped up to me quickly, slapping me in the face. I could feel my cheek burn from the force and I held on to it. What….she had somehow found out. That was the only explanation. \"How dare you...How dare you comfort me yesterday, with an innocent look! How could you when it was father and you who forced him to leave!?\" I looked up at her face and noticed how red her face was, she was very angry. Edith raised her hand again and I flinched back thinking that she would hit me again. Instead she threw a letter at me and I began to read it. \" My dearest Edith, by the time you read this letter, we will have gone. I want to apologize for everything that we have done. We did not mean to interfere with your family and you...we never meant to split your family like we have. Your father and sister seem to think we were using you, which is not the case, at all. We only wanted to befriend someone here, for as long as we stayed. But they thought us awful people. I am sorry to say...that your father has paid us to leave you, we are very sorry to have caused you such pain. Please, accept our apology. I will always love you, Thomas Sharpe\" I could feel my mouth opening wider and wider as I read the letter. \"This...That is not what happened! He lies!\" I looked up at Edith, shaking the letter at her. Wanting her to understand that the letter was fake. This wasn't even his own handwriting! I knew what that looked like, I had many of the letters he had written me still with me in my room. Edith took a step forward, her face twisted with anger. \"Is that what you were doing yesterday? In father's office?\" I tried to touch her arm but she threw it away. \"I thought it was very suspicious.\" I groaned, shaking the letter once more. \"I already told you, this letter is lying. That is not what happened!\" Edith crossed her arm, as if asking me to explain what happened. \"Father found some disturbing facts about those Sharpe siblings, so he gave them a check, telling him to leave you alone. He had proof that he was not a very good person.\" Edith scoffed, pushing me away from the door. \"Move, I am going after him and marrying him. I don't care what you or father says.\" I stomped after her, throwing the letter to the floor, where it belonged. \"So you would rather believe a man who you have just met? Who you barely know?\" I grabbed her arm, pulling her to a stop. \"This is not a fairy tale, Edith! You can not fall in love with a man that quickly without knowing him! This man will kill you! Do you not believe your own flesh and blood!\" Edith pulled her arm away quickly. \"You are no sister of mine.\" I glared at her. \"This is why I am strong, Edith.\" I stepped up to her, pushing her back. \"This is why no-one can hurt me.\" Edith stops, freezing in place. \"I may act like a child, but I know how to control my emotions and actions. I have closed my heart to anything that tries to hurt me. I do not let people get under my skin, like you do. This Thomas Sharpe will kill you. You will see, you will understand and you will want my help but it will be too late.\" Edith spun around and walked away, leaving me looking after her. I fell to my knees and sobbed, covering my face with my hands. \"...She will come around, Lina.\" I looked behind me and saw Helen walking to me, kneeling down beside me, hugging me tightly. I sobbed, leaning into her. \"It will be too late, Helen...It will be too late!\" (3rd pov) Edith ran into the hotel room, breathing heavily. \"Thomas?\" Two maids looked up and stopped giggling. \"Oh, sorry, miss. They left early this morning.\" They curtsied and went back to work. \"Thank you.\" Edith turned and walked out of the room, her head down. Not noticing when Thomas turned the corner. Thomas stopped walking and looked at her, his face filled with confusion. \"Edith?\" Edith's head snapped up at the voice and smiled widely. \"Thomas!\" She ran to him and hugged him tightly, Thomas's arms on his sides. \"You stayed.\" Thomas looked down at Edith, tilting his head to the side. \"Yes….Lucille has already gone home...I waited for-\" Edith interrupted, leaning away from him she smiled brightly at him. \"Thank you, Thomas. I received your letter, about iliana.\" Edith could feel her face turn into a grimace and let go of Thomas. Thomas looked around, trying to find Iliana. \"Did she come with you?\" When he didn't see her he turned back to Edith and noticed her grimace. \"No, we got into an argument this morning.\" Edith hugged him again. \"Thank you, for telling me about everything.\" Thomas pulled away, his hands on her shoulder, looking her straight in the eye. \"What argument….and what did I tell you about everything?\" Edith frowned taking out the letter from her pocket, handing it to him. \"You sent this letter telling me-\" A man behind Thomas cleared his throat, both turning to him. The man's face set in a sad expression. \"Lady Cushin….\" The man looked up at her, fidgeting with his hat. \"I am sorry…\" (iliana's pov/ same time ) I walked to the stairs and stopped immediately. A pain in my chest making me double over, falling on my knees once more. I could feel it extending to my arms and legs. I looked up when there was a knock and sat on the steps, trying to control my breathing. \"Helen…\" My voice came out in a wheezing whisper, but she heard me and walking into the room. Gasping when she was me on the floor. I shooed her away and pointed to the door. \"Open...it.\" Helen nodded and walked to the door, opening it, only to find a man on the other side. \"Is Lady Cushin here?\" I looked up and tried to stand up slowly, the pain still lingering in my body. \"Lady Cushin...I am sorry….but...we found your father this morning….he has been murdered.\" I lost all breath in my body and Helen grabbed my arm, keeping me standing up. \"What?\" I gasped out. \"No! I saw him as he was leaving this morning. You are lying.\" The man shook his head, his face growing sadder. \"I am sorry...but it is the truth, Miss.\" I sobbed quietly, trying to stay standing up. \"Where...where is he? Take me to him!\" The man nodded his head, stepping to me to hold onto my arm. \"Yes but..the thing is...we need you...or your sister to identify him..\" Helen sobbed loudly, covering her mouth with her hand, next to me. Our footsteps getting shakier. I covered my face and nodded to the man, not trusting my voice at the moment. The ride to the morgue was quiet, our sobbs the only thing being heard. When we arrived, my tears had dried and my face felt blank. I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't understand anything anymore. \"This way.\" We followed the man into the room and I saw Thomas and Edith already standing there. Thomas turned his head to me but i looked forward, looking at the body on the table, it was covered with a sheet. I let go of Helen and took slow steps to the body, Helen sobbing quietly behind me. My body moved as if I was a puppet, not having control of it, not having control of anything that was going on. Edith and I walked to the table, her hand moved to mine and we held on tightly, getting ready to see the body. The doors opened loudly, but we didn't flinch, or turned around. We kept our eyes on the body. Alan stepped to the table. \"i am sorry I am late. Edith Lina.\" He nodded his head once to us before turning to the man. \"I came as soon as I heard.\" The man shook his head. \"We need THEM to identify the body.\" Alan took out his things from his bag and set them on the table next to the table with the body. \"It is fine,I can do it, I was his doctor.\" Edith stepped forward, letting go of my hand and pulling the sheet slowly away from the body. When we saw the face we both gasped, edith taking a step back and looking away. I couldn't though, I couldn't look away. I was frozen. The right side of his face wasn't there anymore...or at least wasn't visible at all. it was all red...and raw….and disgusting looking. Edith began to cry behind me and it took me a second to get control of my body. My hand flew to my mouth and I covered it, the sobs escaping from between my fingers. Alan began to check the body and i moved forward, touching my father's left side of his face lightly with the back of my hand. \"This is our father.\" I choked out, in between my fingers. Alan stopped checking the body and turned his head to me, looking sadly at me. \"You don't have to look at him, Lina. I can check him.\" I shook my head tightly, still looking at my father's face. Edith walked to me and pushed Alan's hand away. \"Stop...he was self conscious of his age….of his face…\" Edith sobbed loudly, making me take over for her. \"I pulled away from his forehead, it had been stuck to his forehead from all the blood. \"He was turning sixty next week.\" edith turned to me and hugged me tightly. I hugged her back, Edith releasing me with one hand so she could touch our father's exposed hand. \"His hand is so cold...Why is it so cold?\" I closed my eyes, seeing her cover the hand Edith pulled away, I released her and watched as she made her way to Thomas hugging him tightly. I looked on with a blank expression, not staring at them...but just staring into space. My mind miles away. \"Let us head out, let this man do his job.\" I could feel Alan hugging my shoulders tightly, pulling me towards the exit. Edith had let go of Thomas, hugging Helen instead. If I had looked back I would have seen Thomas standing there a second more, looking at the body of my father….and could have heard the one word that he had said. \" Lucille.\" WHAT DID YOU THINK? AGAIN! IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE LONG AUTHOR NOTE: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOU. I ALREADY SPOKE WITH SPARKY SHE-DEMON AND SHE GAVE ME HER INPUT BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. WHICH ONE WOULD BE BETTER? EITHER LINA GOING TO ALLERDALE HALL WITH THOMAS AND EDITH OR STAYING WITH ALAN AND THEN GOING WITH HIM TO RESCUE EDITH? WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK? LET ME KNOW! THANK YOU! -LINA-[Chapter 6] MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS! WHICHEVER ONE YOU CELEBRATE! A.N.: I am so sorry for not updating! It's been Almost TWO MONTHS! I am so sorry! My classes, exams, work and life in general just got in the way….but I am happy to say that I passed every class with A's….or perfect scores, which ever one lol I will try to update more. I promise. I had this chapter already written before my classes began to get more hectic so it's very short but I hope to update soon since my classes are over for the fall semester. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN CRIMSON PEAK, THEIR PLOT OR THEIR CHARACTERS. I ONLY OWN MY CHARACTER ILIANA. REVIEWS: There's so many to answer! Thank you so much for the reviews! To everyone's votes: I kinda figured a way to have both choices in the outcome of the votes. I hope everyone is happy for this decision. Thank you to everyone who told me their choice! BiteBack: I will include Iliana's and Thomas' background sometime before the end. Or I'll post a separate story just for their background. I'm still thinking about it. But one way or another it will come out. lol XxNatXx : I'm kinda obsessed with Crimson Peak as well. XD You made no mistakes, don't worry! Thank you for reading! Capucine: Merci Beaucoup! Je suis heureux que vous aimez l'histoire jusqu'ici. Je l'espere que vous aimez ma decision sur la facon dont l'histoire va aller. Merci pour commenter. Mon Francais est tres horrible, je suis etudiant francais. J'espere ne pas faire trop d'erreurs! Mariah Papaya: I hope it does grow. I would love to read other stories about Crimson Peak, right now it's kinda limited and I think I've about read all of them lol ElijahJessGodric: I'm glad it seems realistic. I think that her character was very innocent and childish, so I feel like rushing into a relationship with the guy that has been courting her seemed like something she would do. Idk that's just how I feel. FuyukoAme: No worries. : D Thank you everyone for reviewing! I love it! And I promise to write more! 'let us head out, let this mad do his job.\" I could feel Alan hugging my shoulders tightly, pulling me towards the exit. Edith had let go of Thomas, hugging Helen instead. If I had looked back I would have seen Thomas standing there a second more, looking at the body of my father...and could have heard the one word that he had said. \"Lucille.\" I felt frozen. I felt like everything around me was fake, like I was walking inside a dream….or more like a nightmare. I couldn't tell what was real and what was fake. I couldn't make myself wake up from this nightmare. My father had passed away the day before, I should be at home. Mourning his death...instead I was here. In front of a mirror inside the only Church in this town. I could see myself, I could SEE myself standing in front of the mirror but I just couldn't believe that I was here. It was as if I was staring at myself. As if I was outside of my body, watching someone else control my body. How did it get to this? \"Lina?...\" I sighed quietly, fixing my emotions from my face. I couldn't show any emotion beside happiness right now. I didn't want to ruin this moment. \"How do I look?\" I took a deep breath, preparing to lie, to lie to my own sister. I turned around and smiled sweetly. I felt like a complete stranger, how could I be lying to my own sister. I looked at her without really looking at her. She was a blurr to me, her outline was fussy, almost like a mirage. I really was going crazy. \"You look amazing, Edith!\" I walked towards her to see her better, it didn't help. I really couldn't concentrate on her...could it be because I was losing her? Because I knew deep down that I wouldn't be able to protect her anymore? \"Sir Sharpe won't know what hit him.\" Edith smiled brightly, even her smile couldn't get me out of this dream. Couldn't help me understand what was real and what was dream….\"Thank you, sister!\" Edith hugged me tightly. Her hug wasn't bringing me the same joy that it used to bring me. Why was I feeling this way. Why couldn't I be happy about this? I could feel something inside my body break, a prick of pain running inside my body as that something broke and I pulled away, keeping the same sweet smile on my face. \"No problem...I will go check if they are read.\" Edith smiled in thank you and I walked towards the door, my steps slow and steady. I kept my eyes on Mary, who was standing near the door until she was called for, making sure to keep my voice low so that Edith didn't hear. \"Do Not let anyone in unless it is me. Is that clear?\" Mary nodded in reply. Her face blank of any emotion. She knew too, that this was a big mistake. As I made my way to the front of the church, I could see all the decorations. Everything was very beautiful but I couldn't feel happy. I couldn't find the WANT to be happy. I needed air. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I made my way outside and stopped on the last step of the stair. Closing my eyes while taking deep breaths. \"Lady Cushing?:\" I opened my eyes. \"Yes?\" There were two men in front of me, dressed as the police. I straightened myself and stared at the men with blank looks. \"How can I help you, gentlemen?\" The shortest man straightened his shoulders and took a step towards me, his face set in a frown. \"We would like to have a word with you, if you do not mind?\" The other man was looking around, looking very suspicious. I narrowed my eyes, something was wrong. I tilted my head, seeing the Priest making his way towards us from the corner of my eye, I never broke eye contact with the gentleman in front of me. \"About?\" I asked, my voice deathly quiet. The second man took off his hat and took a step towards me, his expression filled with regret. He looked like he didn't want to be there. Like he hated what he was doing. \"Y-your father's death, Lady C-cushing.\" I looked at both of the man and something clicked. I knew what was wrong with this picture, I narrowed my eyes again and glared at the first man, knowing that he was leader. The other one was too quiet,shy too new. I scoffed. \"You want to know if I have an alibi, don't you?\" The man narrowed his eyes at me, taking another step towards me, trying to make himself look intimidating. \"Yes, well...He did leave you everything.\" I clenched my hands, trying to control my anger. \"And you automatically assume that it was me, who killed him?\" The second man put a hand on the first man and lightly pulled back, his face red with embarrassment. \"I am t-terribly sorry ma'am. But it is protocol.\" I let out a breath, trying to control the anger that I felt. For some reason, I was having a harder time controlling my anger. If you'd like to know, I was here, speaking with the Pastor of this church.\" I turned my head to the left, looking behind the two policemen. \"Wasn't I, Pastor?\" Both men turned around and bowed their heads, seeing the pastor behind them. The Pastor smiled at them kindly, patting their shoulders as he took his place beside me. \"Yes, she was here very early and left mid-day. Why do you ask?\" I pointed at the two men with my head, my expression going blank now that I had someone on my side. I knew that the Pastor would put them in their place. \"They are accusing me of killing my own father. Just because he game me everything.\" The pastor frowned, his forehead wrinkling. \"Gentlemen, I assure you, this child would never harm anyone. Unless they harmed her first….and her father never harmed her.\" The second man stayed silent, his eyes looking at the ground in guilt. I could feel a sick satisfaction from seeing him looking guilty. There was something very wrong with me. The first man stepped up and bowed at the Pastor, he looked very persistent. Pulling the first man with him. You have to understand that it is a bit strange that he would change everything to her name, the night before he passed away.\" I sighed loudly, getting bored with the conversation. \"If you read the letters you would know that he changed everything to my name two weeks before I came back from London. I signed them the night before his death. I wasn't even here to influence his want to change everything to my name.\" I crossed my arms and stared at the first man blankly. My mind growing sharper as the conversation went on. I could feel my old self coming back. \"It is only protocol, we apologize ma'am.\" The second finally spoke up, his voice ending in a high note. I felt myself relax back into my self as he spoke. I felt bad for him, having to put up with a partner like the first man. I smiled sweetly. \"Yes, well. I would have liked it better if you had approached me after my sister's wedding. You may leave.\" I waved my hand in a dismissing manner, not caring that it was rude. The first man sneered at me and bowed. \"Yes. Apologies, Ma'am.\" They finally began to leave and I let out a huge sigh of relief. My muscles began to unwind and I closed my eyes. \"She is going through with it?\" I looked at the pastor and sighed, rubbing my face. \"Yes, I've tried getting her to stop this but...you know Edith….she inherited our father's stubbornness.\" \"Yes, but you inherited your mother's protective heart and her cunning mind.\" The pastor sighed deeply, crossing his arms. \"This will be a real wedding, Iliana. I can not fake a wedding, even if it is to save someone's life. Especially if that someone does not want to be saved.\" I closed my eyes tightly, feeling the rays of the sun heat my face. It felt nice to finally be able to feel again. There was something wrong with me earlier, losing all emotion...that wasn't normal. I gulped, looking directly at the Pastor. My decision had been made, I had made it the moment she had said agreed to marry thomas. \"I know….that is why...I have decided to go with her. To look after her.\" His eyebrows narrowed, reaching his arms out, holding onto my shoulders. His expression filled with worry. \"How will you communicate with us, Iliana? They live four hours away from any type of civilization.\" I rubbed my face furiously, not knowing how to answer. \"I will find a way. They still believe Edith owns everything.\" The pastor patted my shoulders lightly. \"Why not tell him that you own everything? It will make him think twice about marrying her. I groaned loudly, getting down on the floor, hugging my knees to my chest. I hid my face in my knees. \"I don't know what to do...if I tell Thomas about that he will not want to marry Edith...which will break her heart and make her hate me.\" I took a deep breath. \"But if I don't tell him, they will get married and then they will try to kill her, which is worse….What should I do?\" I could feel my eyes stinging, tears were ready to fall down and I couldn't hold them back. I was feeling very desperate at that moment. I would have rather liked not to feel anything at all like earlier, than feel all of those emotions. \"Let her get married.\" The pastor and I looked towards the door and saw Helen standing there, her eyes narrowed. She looked like a wicked storm ready to be unleashed, I had never seen her like that. \"Let her get married but tell both of those siblings that you own everything. Tell them after they get married, after you are in their home…\" Helen mouth twitching in anger. \"That way they will know that they are not getting a cent. If they try anything...then let us know, we will go to you and they will go down.\" Helen took a step towards us, her eyes narrowing even more as she looked in the the distance behind the pastor and I. I couldn't look away from her though, her eyes were almost glowing with anger. \"They will not be able to do anything to anyhone else, never again. They will not harm another living soul.\" I stood up and walked slowly towards Helen, her eyes never leaving whatever she was looking at. \"You will stay at the house, right? With Mary?\" Helen nodded her head, I didn't think she was paying any attention to me. \"That house belongs to you now.\" I touched her arm lightly, smiling kindly at her, she still wasn't looking at me. \"I don't mean just until I come back with Edith...I mean it belongs to you from now on.\" Helen's head turned to me, her eyes wide, filling with tears. \"We...we cannot accept that, Lina. We can not!\" She began to shake her head rapidly, tears flying everywhere. \"It has been in your family since before your great grandfather.\" I smiled, hugging her tightly. \"You ARE family, Helen. You were like a mother to us when our own mother passed away. Mary has been like a sister to me…\" I smiled sadly, touching her cheek. \"You are our only family, now. That house is now yours.\" Helen began to sob loudly, throwing her arms around me. I could feel her body shaking from the sobs. \"Thank you, thank you so much!\" I laughed lightly, hugging her just as tightly. \"Just don't be having wild parties, Helen. And don't let Mary bring strange men to the house.\" Helen laughed, muffled by my shoulder. I laughed with her. A throat cleared behind me and I froze when I recognized the voice. So that's who she was glaring at. \"Am I interrupting something?\" I took a deep breath, and laughed again. Pulling away from Helen. \"No, No.\" I turned around, facing Thomas. I walked towards him and held his hands, I could feel something inside of me break again. I could feel the pain getting worse but I held on to his hands and smiled sweetly. \"I will say this once, in front of the Pastor and my second mother, so we have witnesses.\" I began to rub my thumbs on his hands and I felt him shudder, his eyes fixed on my own. The something that was inside of me was breaking again. \"If you hurt my sister in ANY way…..I will destroy you. You and Lucille will pay dearly if you hurt her. Understand?\" Thomas gulped loudly, his eyes growing in size. \"Good….\" I patted his cheek, rubbing my thumb in a soft way. I lowered my voice, my eyes growing sad. \"I wish it was me marrying you….I really do wish it..\" He opened his mouth to say something, his eyes saddening, and I held up my other hand. \"But it is too late. You got my sister to fall for you and now you must follow through with what you started.\" I leaned away and glanced at his hands, still in the air from when I was holding on to them. \"Father was right…\" I touched his hands again, lightly tracing patterns into them. \"You do have smooth hands…\" Thomas flinched, pulling his hands away. I could see that I had hurt him deeply by what I had said. \"Lina?\" We both turned to the door and saw Mary looking very anxious. \"She is ready.\" I could feel my chest tighten painfully and I nodded. \"Got it. I'll be there in a second.\"I turned to Thomas again, My eyes going blank. \"I will be visiting you very soon. I need to sort some things here before I go visit. But expect a visit from me VERY soon.\" I turned and left him standing there, before he could say anything. During the wedding I could the something breaking even more until they said their vows and I knew exactly what it was. I knew what it was when I could feel it shattering inside of me, I could feel the room around me growing smaller and smaller to the point where I had to get out of there. I couldn't look at them kiss, I couldn't look at how happy they looked. So I left. and told Helen to say that I needed to get some things ready, like their carriage or Edith's suitcases to be ready for her departure. My heart had been shattered and the pain had been excruciating. I had waited an hour inside my room until they finally arrived and I descended the stairs, smiling when I saw Edith's glowing face, I made sure to never look at Thomas directly. \"You will come visit me soon?\" I smiled at Edith's hopeful look and nodded my head. \"Of course. I will only take a week or two.\" Edith sighed in relief. \"Thank you.\" She hugged me tightly and turned to Thomas. \"We will be happily waiting for you.\" I smiled sharply at Thomas, finally meeting his eyes. Give Lucille a big hug from me, Edith. Tell her I miss her greatly.\" I smirked when I saw Thomas's eyes widen. Edith smiled brightly, holding on to Thomas' arm. \"I will. Goodbye.\" Edith pulled Thomas away towards the carriage. They sat down with them facing me, Edith waving rapidly. I waved back and felt Alan step behind me, holding on to my waist. Thomas' eyes narrowed, his expression closing off. \"What do you need done?\" I turned my head to Alan and sighed. \"Paper work. My father's business won't run itself, after all.\" Alan touched my cheek and looked into my eyes, knowing exactly how exhausted I was. \"I will go with you when you visit them.\" I smiled, leaning my head on his chest. I could feel myself become tired from all the acting that day. From all the emotions I had gone through. Alan was my rock, he was the person I could trust. Even if I didn't have any romantic feelings towards him. Why couldn't I have fallen for him instead? \" You most certainly won't.\" I let go and walked into the house, taking off my outer jacket. \"You can not go by yourself, Lina.\" Alan grabbed my shoulders and turned me towards him. \"I've traveled by myself before. I've already gone to England. I don't need you going with me. I can protect myself.\" Alan grabbed my shoulders lightly. \"We are to be married soon. You can trust me.\" I sighed deeply, patting his hands. \"I do trust you but….we are not going through with the marriage, Alan.\" Alan's eyes widened. \"Edith will be back home soon, and she will be divorce and in need of a friend. You will be able to marry her then, if my plan works.\" Alan narrowed his eyes in suspicion. \"What are you hiding?\" I smiled secretly, knowing that it irked him to not know what was going on. \"I will tell you everything later...not right now though, it is not time.\" We stayed silent for a few minutes while Alan thought things through, until finally he nodded, coming up with whatever though he had come up with. \"I trust you, Lina.\" I smiled brightly and kissed his cheek. \"And I thank you for that, dear sir.\" A.N. SO WHAT DID YOU THINK?[Chapter 7] I do not remember everything that happened so I'm sorry if some scenes change a bit! A.N: I do not own Crimson Peak or its characters. I only own my character. It was finally time. It had taken me a while but I had finally finished everything that needed to be done. I had left Edith alone with the Sharpe's for too long. I just hoped it wouldn't be too late. \"Do you know where they live?\" I turned to Alan, he looked around the small shops around us. He had insisted on coming with us, telling me that if it was as bad as I was making it seem, then Edith would need a doctor immediately. I couldn't deny him after that. I hadn't even thought about the fact that Edith would need a doctor, I was selfishly only thinking about stopping Thomas and Lucille...I hadn't even thought of Edith getting hurt. I shook my head and turned to look around as well. \"No...There must be someone here who can point us in their direction.\" We had been dropped off by a carriage, we could have technically asked the driver to take us there but when we mentioned it...he had told us that he could only take us to the small town but no further. Especially since it was so dark. The man had only told us to get a hotel and then in the morning one of the town people could take us. Alan nudged my arm lightly and pointed to my left with his chin. An older gentleman walked up to us, taking his hat off in the process. He was smiling brightly. \"Hello, there. Do you need some help?\" I smiled brightly and curtsey. \"Hello, sir. My friend and I\", I pointed at Alan , nudging him to bow. \" we're looking to get a ride to Allerdale Hall.\" The man's smile dimmed a bit, looking confused before regaining composure. \"Of course. If you'll give me a moment to get a carriage ready.\" We both nodded and watched as he walked to a barn house. Alan held onto my arm and turned me to him. \"What was that? Why did he act like that when you mentioned Allerdale?\" I stared straight into my eyes, trying to get the truth from me. He knew me well. He knew how to get me to say the truth. I turned my eyes away and shrugged. He tightened his grip, his voice quiet but still very angry. \"What are you hiding, iliana? Are you putting yourself in danger?\" Before I could answer the man came out with a carriage and motioned for us to get on. We climbed in, when the carriage began to move Alan cleared his throat. He was angry at me. \"Sir...May I ask you something?\" The man nodded at Alan, his eyes to the front. \"You seemed confused when my friend asked about Allerdale...why was that?\" I lowered my head but still paying close attention to the man's answer. It took a couple of seconds before the man answered. He was hesitant. \"...The people who own that mansion...are very recluse. They come down maybe once or twice a month to buy essentials. We don't see them very often.\" The man tilted his head in confusion. \" Its as if they are ghosts.\" He turned to look at us, his eyes wide. \"They are very kind people, mind you...according to the few that were hired to help them. ...but it is still strange.\" Alan sat forward. \"Have you seen them recently?\" The man nodded. \"Did you happen to see a woman with them? She's very young, blond?\" The man thought for a few seconds before nodded his head quickly. \"As a matter of fact, yes I have. I saw her the first day she got to the mansion. I was helping the Sharpe's with a few things that day.\" We hit a rock and I bumped into Alan. It seemed as if he wasn't paying attention to anything except what the man was saying. \" Poor dear, though.\" I turned my head to the man quickly, my eyes wide. \"She seemed very sickly. The weather has been a bit cold lately...she must not be used to it.\" I clenched my hands into fists, they were shaking with anger. Alan put his hand over mine and squeezed lightly. \"Could we go faster,sir?\" I asked, my voice cracking with the anger I felt. \"Of course, dear.\" We began to speed up and I could finally see the silhouette of a house up ahead. \"Do you know the young woman?\" I sat up, getting ready to get off and up to the house. \" She's my friends sister...\" Alan answered for me, getting ready to get off as well. The carriage stopped in front of the house, once there he helped us with our bags. The man looked at the house. \"Well, this is it.\" He laughed lightly at the expression in our faces. \"It seems a bit run down, but they are repairing it.\" He laughed again when Alan said 'a bit'. We thanked him and he bid us farewell. There was barely any light coming from the house. As if it was abandoned. \"She's used to the cold, Alan...she never gets cold...at least not when it's this temperature...\" Alan sighed and began to lead me to the door. I knocked on the door once and stopped immediately when I heard a male voice scream out, 'Stop lucille, there is someone at the door.' I could feel my heart speed up, something was wrong. I quickly opened the door and what I saw stopped me, freezing me in place. I could see everything moving in slow motion. Edith was falling. All I could do was scream her name. When she landed on the ground I forced myself to move and ran to Edith's side, kneeling down to check her over. \"Edith! Edith please...please wake up!\" I could feel my eyes begin to water and they forced their way down my cheeks. \" Oh God...\" I touched her hair. I could feel when Alan had run to us, trying to check Edith over. Making sure that she was alright. I could see Lucille and Thomas walking down the stairs, in the corner of my eye. I stood up and glared at them. \"What. Happened. To. Her?\" Lucille stared at me, a blank expression on her face. She was only wearing a night dress, one side falling off her shoulder. \"She tripped, running down the stairs. The poor dear...didn't your parents ever teach you not to run down stairs?\" Thomas began to make his way to us and Lucille glared at him. Telling him something with her eyes. Thomas ignored Lucille, stood in front of me. \"Iliana...\" I could hear Alan mumbling to himself behind me. I walked to Alan and got down on my knees. \"Help me pick her up, Alan...since, obviously, they are incapable of helping.\" Alan checked her back quickly, making sure that she was able to move without hurting her back. Alan picked her up and moved her to the chair, making sure that she was comfortable. \"Why are you here?\" Lucille walked towards us, her face not as blank as before. There was some anger showing...but not enough. I gasped mockingly, my anger getting the best of me. \"Oh...\" I looked at her smirking. \"Didn't your dear brother tell you I was coming?\" I tilted my head to the side. \"How rude of him. I even asked him to say hello for me.\" Lucille stared at me, never once looking at Thomas. \"...Is she telling the truth, Thomas?\" Thomas gulped softly, his hands shaking visibly. \"Y-yes. I had forgotten.\" I smiled sweetly, staring directly at Lucille the whole time. We were measuring each other up. Knowing that one of us would have to give in eventually. \"Of course you forgot...with my sister as your beautiful wife...who wouldn't forget things.\" I could see Lucille begin to get more and more angry. Her face turning a horrible shade of red. \"Now...\" I clapped my hands, smiling brightly. \"Why don't you be a dear and bring something to help with Edith?\" Lucille clenched her hands. \"You do it. \" She said through clenched teeth. I gasped, mockingly again. \"How rude! Is this how you treat your guests?\" I tsked and shook my head in disapproval. \" Now I see why nobody comes to visit you.\" \"Lina, stop mocking them and help me with Edith.\" Alan growled out, having had enough of my taunting. I walked to Alan and did as he asked, meanwhile Thomas and Lucille staring at us, not saying anything. \" She should be fine. We can't let her move around much until we can exam her back completely. \" Alan looked at the Sharpe's. \"how did this really happen?\" Before they could say anything, I spoke up, looking at a dazed Edith, my jaw clenching in anger. \"First...Thomas, could you bring some warm covers for Edith? Your wife is very cold right now.\" Thomas nodded quickly and walked away. Lucille took a step forward, her face still as red as before. She wasn't as composed as before. \"I already told you. She tripped. She fell down. It is very slippery because of the snow.\" Everything was quiet until Thomas walked in with an armload of blankets. He carried them to Edith and we both put them around Edith, making sure that she was completely covered. When we were done, Thomas began to walk away but I grabbed his arm and glared at him. \"Is that how your past wives died?\" They both froze in shock. \"It seems that you've been a married man before.\" Alan took a step towards me, his face paling. \" I just wanted to know if they all tripped as well?\" I began to look around at the house. \"Your home does seem a bit...unstable.\" I looked at Lucille. \"People could easily have accidents.\" My voice turning mocking. \"I'm sorry about your past wives.\" Alan grabbed my arm, squeezing tightly. \"How did you know about them?\" Lucille growled out, walking slowly towards me. I pouted, not caring how tightly Alan was squeezing, the more I spoke. \"Do you really think my father didn't care about our well being?\" I took a step forward, Alan's arm preventing me from moving further. I stared angrily at Lucille. \" My father wanted the best for us. That meant the best husbands and that those husbands could give us everything we could desire and more..\" I raised my head higher, looking at her with malice. \" You know how fathers are. They love their children and want the best for them...\" They tensed and I gasped mockingly. \" Oh...oh my. I'm so sorry.\" I put my hand over my mouth. \"Sometimes my mouth opens before I can think about what I'm saying.\" \"Get to the point!\" Lucille was finally beginning to lose her composure. I looked away, as if thinking. \" mmm...Oh yes!\" I clapped. A bit hard when Alan was still holding onto my arm. \" So my father wanted the best for me, so he got me engaged to Alan.\" I could see Thomas flinching from the corner of my eye. But at this point I didn't care, everything was numb. \"He wanted the best for Edith...so he looked into your background, since she wanted to marry Thomas.\" I shook my arm, making Alan let go, his grip had gotten to be very unbearable. \"He did some digging up...but died before he could uncover anything past you having been married before.\" Alan let go, finally, and I began to walk to the chair next to Edith. Not looking at her. If I had looked at her, I wouldn't have been able to continue. \"He showed me before he passed away...\" I sat down and crossed my leg over the other. \" Now...After you three left. I did some digging of my own, that's why it took me so long to get here...sorry about that.\" I smiled apologetically. \"So I did some digging up and found out that not only had you had wives before...but that they had also passed away tragically.\" I frowned. \"How sad...at least you got their inheritance money.\" I put my elbow on the arm of the couch and leaned against my hand. \"That is why you hired those people...right?\" There was silence for a while. Neither of them knowing what to say. I sat forward and looked at Thomas. \"But...I'm glad you finally married out of love and not for money. Lucille probably forced you to marry for money, right?\" I waited a few seconds before they both answered with a 'what'. Alan stomped over to me and grabbed my wrist. His face filled with anger and betrayal. Anger at the Sharpe's, betrayal at me for not letting him know what was going on before hand. \"Stop. You've said enough.\" I stood up quickly and glared menacingly. \"No. You see how Edith is. They did this to every other woman he married...\" I choked on a sob. \"I was going to be next...\" Alan froze. \"It should have been me.\" I looked at Alan, pleading with him to understand. \"Edith should have never suffered this. If I had done something before they met her...she wouldn't have been in this mess.\" Alan's grip relaxed and he ran his thumb over where he had been gripping. His voice softened to a whisper, his face sad. \"We can save her now.\" I shook my head quickly. \"Not until they are dead. That bitch won't have it any other way!\" Alan stayed silent. I looked at Lucille. \"Your plan was perfect once again...except you chose the wrong family to mess with.\" Alan let go of my wrist and I took a step forward. \"you think that by killing Edith...you will get all of her inheritance?\" I laughed loudly. \"My father was a very smart man. Edith received his looks...and his kind heart. \" I smirked. \"I received my father's intelligence. We both saw something was wrong with you two. That's why...my father took away Edith's inheritance and gave it to me.\" Their eyes widened in shock, Lucille stepping forward. \"What?\" I tilted my head. \"Your plan didn't work out?\" I turned around quickly when I heard a quiet sob behind me. Edith had finally woken up and she had heard everything. I ran to her side quickly, Alan already checking that everything was alright with her. \"Edith...are you alright?\" Edith nodded and Alan and I helped her when she tried standing up. She stared piercingly at Thomas, her eyes red and puffy. \"Is it true?\" Her voice was soft and raspy. Thomas turned away in shame, making Edith sob again. Alan picked up a folder with paperwork from my bag and brought it over. I hesitated, not knowing how much more Edith could take. \"...That's not all, Edith...\" Edith opened up the folder. \" Mrs. Sharpe was found dead in her bathtub...it looked like her skull had been crushed in. there was no one else in the house...except her two children.\" Lucille clenched her jaw, her body visibly shaking in anger. \"Edith...\" Thomas stepped forward, reaching for Edith. Edith shook her head violently, stepping away. \"No...\" She began to cry again and I held on to her tightly. \"We're through here. We're leaving.\" Alan hugged Edith, helping her walk towards the door. I began walking behind them, grabbing our things from the floor. I looked up when Edith screamed Alan's name and saw that Lucille had stabbed Alan. \"Alan!\" I screamed and ran to him, stopping only when I saw Lucille push Edith away. Lucille turned to me with the knife and pointed at the chair. \"You, sit.\" When I didn't follow her directions she backhanded me and I fell to the ground, A shallow cut across my cheek. I could hear Edith scream my name and I looked in time to see Lucille push Thomas towards Alan. \"you finish this. Get your hands dirty.\" I clutched my cheek, trying to sit up. \"you truly are the one behind the whole thing.\" Lucille spun to face me and screamed. \"Shut your mouth!\" I stood up and saw Thomas stab Alan. \"Alan!\" I ran towards alan, pushing Lucille away, catching her off guard. I fell on my knees and checked his pulse. \"Alan?\" I could faintly feel his heartbeat. He wasn't dead. \"How...why?\" I looked at Thomas, confused. He only stared at me. As if trying to make me understand something, before I could decipher what he was trying to tell me, Lucille spoke up behind us. \"Good, thomas bring her along. We will need her to sign the paperwork to get her inheritance.\" Thomas grabbed my arm, pulling me up. I could see Lucille dragging Edith by her arm in front of us and I turned my head to the side, keeping my eyes on Lucille. \"You can stop this. Help us.\" Thomas shook his head softly, whispering. \"I can't.\" I looked at him, finally. Seeing the hesitant expression on his face. \"Thomas, we don't hate you.\" He turned towards me. \"We knew who the real person was, the one behind this whole thing. You will not be blamed.\" Thomas stayed silent, processing what I had said. \"If you help us, you will be able to stay married with Edith. Just...help us. Please. Don't let her get killed.\" I begged, my voice breaking with helplessness. Thomas hesitated a few more seconds before he looked at me with determination. \"I will not let Edith die...for you.\" I could feel the tears begin to run down my face. Once we reached the attic, Lucille sat me down in a chair and I stared quietly at the table. Not wanting her to see any type of expression. Edith sat beside me...she wasn't as quiet as I was. We had switched roles. \"You are still making me sign? Even knowing that Lina is the one with the inheritance?\" Lucille was doing something to the side and I grabbed on to Edith's wrist, trying to make her be quiet...but of course...she didn't pay attention. Lucille laughed quietly. \"Of course. Once you sign, I will kill her and you will get the inheritance.\" When I felt Edith tense up, about to speak up, I snorted. \"Wrong. y inheritance will go to Alan. If Alan dies...we made it to where it would have gone to the orphanage back home and some to my maids.\" Lucille growled loudly, dropping what she had in her hand and began charging towards me. I sat up, ready to fight but Edith had beaten me. Edith stood up and stabbed Lucille with a pen , grabbing my arm when Lucille began walking slowly backwards. \"Let's go.\" I put my arm around Edith and helped her run away. \"Alan!\" Edith screamed, pulling me another way. \"They killed Alan! We can't leave his body here.\" I pulled Edith towards the door. \"No, they didn't. Thomas stabbed him where it wouldn't kill him. Just paralyze him.\" We were almost to the door. Edith gasped loudly for air, her injury still making it hard for her to move. \"Where is he, then?\" I looked around when we got to the basement, trying to find a hiding place. \"I don't know...you know the house better. Where would they have hidden him?\" Edith leaned against the wall, gasping for air...we took a second to think of what we had to do. Edith looked at the floor, whispering softly. \"W-what did you mean by you were next?\" I tensed, my back to her, still looking around for where Alan could be. \"I...met Thomas before I went back home. I thought...I thought I was in love but...\" Edith leaned her head against the wall and closed her eyes, tears running down her cheeks. \"Why didn't you tell me? I wouldn't have gotten married with him...I'm so sorry.\" I shook my head and smiled sadly. \"No. You had already fallen in love with him. I couldn't do that to you.\" I cupped her cheeks, wiping the tears away. \"If I had known how bad it would be...I would have tried to stop you.\" Edith stared at me for a while before her eyes moved to the side, gasping loudly when she saw something. \"There! Alan!\" I turned around and helped Edith walk towards Alan, who was leaning against a wall. I pulled away from Edith and whispered when I heard something from the floor above us. \"Take him and hide. I'm going to get the horses.\" Edith nodded and I ran towards the basement doors that led outside. A blizzard had begun when everything had been going on. It was hard to see anything. \"Horses...where are you...\" I put my arm over my eyes, hiding them from the snow and ice. \"Iliana...\" I stopped walking, scared that something was calling out to me. I turned around and froze. Thomas was standing there...but he ...looked different. He had a cut on his cheek...deeper than mine...and he was white. Pale white...like the snow. \"Thomas...?\" I took a step forwards, my hand reaching out to him. \"Lina...\" When I was a foot in front of him I stopped. My gasp turned into a sob when I realize why he looked like that. \"No...\" I shook my head rapidly, not wanting to believe. \"No, you can't be...\" I choked on my sob. Thomas smiled sadly, reaching out to touch my cheek. I put my hand on top of his, realizing that I was touching my cheek, instead of his hand. \"It's all my fault...oh God...I caused you to die. \" I sobbed louder, my body curling into itself in pain. \"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.\" Thomas tried to touch my shoulder, trying to help me uncurl. \" It is not your fault. This needed to happen...our sins...were too horrible. Lucille and I needed to die.\" I tried touching his cheek but when my hand went through him I fell on my knees and sobbed louder. If I had thought my heart had broken before, it was nothing compared to how it felt now. I could feel everything going numb. I could feel my heart...what was left of it disappearing. I felt Thomas kneel down infront of me. \"I've always loved you.\" I looked up, seeing his blurry shape because of the tears . \"I will always love you...please believe me. That day, when we met, I knew you were different. As we spent more time together...I knew I couldn't use you in our horrible pan.\" Thomas smiled. \"I was too enamoured with you. I'm glad I didn't chose you that day. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself.\" I threw myself at him, forgetting that I would go through him, but for a second I could feel him. I could feel myself hugging him. \"I love you!\" His arms went around me and I could feel them. \"Please don't go.\" Thomas hugged me tighter for a second before reluctantly letting go. \"I have to. There is one last thing I must do before I leave this world. Your sister needs my help.\" I looked up and knew right away that this wasn't over. \"Lucille.\" Thomas nodded and we both stood up. \"Gather the horses. They are behind that shed. I will go to her.\" I hesitated . \"Trust me. We will meet again.\" I didn't want to let him go...I didn't...but Edith needed him more. This nightmare needed to be over. I looked at him and nodded once. \"Good bye, Thomas.\" \"Good-bye, iliana.\" I ran to the shed and pulled out the horses, there was only two so Edith and Alan would have to share.I tried hard not to think, not to cry. I pulled them to where I had last left Edith. \"Lina! Over here!\" I looked towards a big machine and saw Edith and Alan holding each other up. I ran towards them with the horses. \"I have the horses! Are you both alright?\" Edith sighed softly, sadly looking at the ground. \"We're fine...but Lina...Thomas...he's-\" I didn't want to hear it so I interrupted her. \"I know. ...he came to me.\" Edith nodded and helped Alan towards the horses. \"Lets go...I wish to go home now.\" Alan grunted. \"As do I.\" I helped Alan and Edith get onto their horse and I got onto mine. The storm had finally stopped, as if it had known that the nightmare was finally over. I smiled sadly. \"You are divorced my dear sister...or I should say widowed.\" Edith stared ahead. \"Don't remind me. I want this nightmare to disappear.\" I looked at Alan and smirked. \"You should marry someone else. To help you get over it.\" Alan turned his head quickly towards me, glaring. Edith blinked. \"who? Who would take a widow?\" I coughed. \"Alan\" I thought I had hid it well but I guess not...sorry Alan. Edith looked over her shoulder. \"Alan?\" Alan kept glaring at me. \"If I wasn't hur Iliana...I would.\" I laughed quietly. \"Oooh, I'm so scared. Can't even finish his threats.\" I flipped my hair back, ignoring the still fuming Alan. Edith sighed. \"I don't know how father thought you two were good together. You bicker like siblings...sometimes I think you two are siblings instead of us two.\" Alan and I glared at each other, disgusted by the thought. \"Ha! We would probably kill each other...\" all three of us got quiet. \"...sorry...didn't mean to bring it up...\" for the rest of the ride we stayed quiet. Finally. The nightmare had ended. (2017) \"Liliana! We're going to be late!\" I groaned into my pillow, grabbing the other pillow and putting it over my head. I hated mornings. So. Much. \"Hurry up!\" I felt the pillows and covers get ripped away from my body. My cocoon! I sat up and glared at Eaden. \"Wait...why...did you wear your day clothes to bed?\" Eady asked, her eyes wide in disgust. I snorted and got out of bed, heading to the mirror. \"No, dear sister. I have been up since 6 waiting for you to get ready. Now let's go.\" I headed to the door and laughed quietly when Eady punched my arm. \"I swear one day I'm just gonna let you go on your own stupid adventures and I won't follow you.\" I hear a car honk outside and I grabbed both of our bags, giving hers as she passed by me. \"Eady, you were the one that wanted to come here. I said let's go to a real vacation...like Hawaii...or Paris...or you know...London but instead you bring us to some rural place in England.\" We got into the taxi and the driver smiled at us. \"Where to ?\" Eady leaned forwards and gave him a piece of paper. \"Allerdale Hall?\" He looked at us. \"Why would you like to go there? It's haunted, you know...\" I sighed. \"That's exactly why. My sister loves a good ghost story.\" I leaned back and Eady smacked my arm. \"That's not why! It has some amazing history. And it's very beautiful.\" You could practically see stars in my sister's eyes from just imagining how wonderful this place was. \"Ghost stories.\" The driver and I said at the same time and both laughed at the expression on Eady's face. She leaned back and pouted out the window. I turned my Ipod on and listened to music while looking out the window. Eady making small talk with the driver, he was very nice and he knew quite a bit about the history around here. Well...it shouldn't come as a surprise since he's lived here his whole life. Eady smacked my arm repeatedly, pointing to the building appearing in front of us. I looked ahead and gasped. It was huge! And very worn down. It looked like it had been repaired in the past but still needed some repairing done. The taxi driver let us off, telling us to call him once we were done, when he drove away we walked quietly towards the building. Eady was practically jumping in place, ready to go explore the building. I, however, got a very strange feeling. This place gave me the creeps. I watched as Eady walked to the door and opened it easily. I walked to her and looked around. the inside was a mess. Everything was destroyed. \"Wow...so not what I thought it was going to be.\" I rolled my eyes, still looking around. \"It's been around since the 1800's, Eady. What did you expect?\" Eady sat down on a beaten chair and sighed loudly. \"But its historical, shouldn't they keep it in tip top shape? For people that want to visit?\" I looked at the ceiling in wonder. \"This was a place of great misfortune, Eady. A bunch of horrible things happened here. A lot of deaths. A lot of murders. Why would they keep something like that in tip top shape?\" I walked towards the stairs and looked up. Eady was off doing something in the kitchen, not even bothering to answer me. I scratched my head, looking up the stairs and freezing. There was a man there. Standing at the very top floor. He was wearing a white suit...but it looked decaying. Dried blood stains everywhere. He was completely pale. And his cheek...oh gah, he had a deep gash on his cheek. We stared at each other for a few minutes, until I blinked and he was gone. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, thinking that it would appear again. When it didn't, I laughed at how silly I was being. There was no way there were ghosts here. I began to turn around. I felt a hand land on my shoulder and screamed my lungs out. I turned towards the hand and walked backwards, falling on my bottom. I couldn't stop screaming. \"Liliana!\" Eady ran towards me, a rusty knife in her hands. \"Who the hell are you?!\" Eady stood in front of me, knife pointed at the person that had scared me. I was shaking from the fright. I couldn't even stand up because of the shaking. \"I should be asking you that. This is my property after all.\" I looked up, trying to see the person...the man that had spoken. Eady was blocking my view of him. I could see that he was tall, very tall. He wore black jeans. That's all I could make out. \"Oh! I thought the website said it wasn't owned by anybody. Tourists can come and go as they please.\" Eady lowered the knife slowly, not knowing if she could trust this man. The man was quiet for a second. \"I recently bought it...what is your name?\" I gulped and stood up on shaky legs. \"Shouldn't you say your name first, before asking ours?\" Eady turned towards me, finally letting me see what the man looked like. He was tall, like I had originally thought. He had dark hair. He was wearing a blue shirt with a black jacket on top. His eyes though, they were a mesmerizing blue. When he saw me, they had widened, freezing in place. There was something strangely familiar about him. Eady touched my arm. \"Are you ok?\" I broke eye contact and looked at Eady, nodding my head. \"Yeah, I just didn't realize there was someone else in the house. It kinda made me jump.\" Eady laughed, pushing me softly. \"Jump? More like scream bloody murder.\" The man cleared his throat and we both turned to him. \"I apologize for scaring you. My name is Tom.\" Eady smiled brightly. She always was very friendly with people. We needed to work on that. This guy was giving me the creeps. \"It's alright! Lily is scared easily. Especially in a place where its suppose to be haunted.\" Eady stuck her hand towards Tom. \"My name is Eadin. And this is my sister Liliana.\" Tom shook her hand. \"Pleasure to meet you. Both of you.\" Tom stuck his hand towards me and I hesitantly shook his hand, regretting instantly when I felt a shock go up my arm when I touched him. \"Ah!\" I pulled my arm towards me and shook it, trying to get rid of the feeling. He creeped me out. He kept staring at me. \"Soooo...did you buy the place?\" Eady rocked back and forth on her heels, trying to get his attention away from me. She knew I hated people staring at me. He turned to her . \"You could say that. I inherited it from a family member that used to own this place.\" I crossed my arms. \"Really? Cause I did my research when Eady wanted to come here.\" Tom turned to me, his gaze looking right into my soul. I shivered. \" The last person to own this place was back in the 1800's. Then they tried to tear it down when they found out there had been murders happening here. Until the ex wife of one of the owners stopped the destruction.\" Eady gasped loudly, grabbing hold of Tom's hand. \"Wait! This! This is the Sharpe ring!\" Eady looked at me, excitement in her eyes. \"remember I told you that the ex wife was married to a Sharpe. They had a photo and I saw the man wearing this ring! Where did you find it?!\" Tom looked at Eady and smiled thinly. \"Family heirloom.\" Eady smiled brightly. \"Hold on a sec!\" She ran to her bag by the door, leaving me alone with Tom. \"I apologize for scaring you, again.\" I looked at Tom and nodded. \"No problem. I wasn't paying attention. This place gives me the creeps.\" I rubbed my arms, feeling the cold seep through my bones. Tom smiled softly. \"Cold?\" Before I could answer Eady ran back to me, bringing a piece of paper with her. \"Look! I have a piece of the newspaper that has the past owners pictures. The ex wife and the husband.\" Eady gave it to me and when I touched it I felt a shock shoot up my arm, like the one when I touched Tom's hand. I gasped looking at the picture. \"The man...\" I whispering, not realizing I had said it out loud. \"he looks like the man I saw...\" Eady laughed, \"You mean he looks like Tom. So then he's telling the truth, Lily. They're relatives.\" I kept staring at the picture. \"Is it ok if we look around, Tom? Explore around?\" I didn't hear Tom's reply, I was focused on the picture, but I did notice Eady's feet disappear from my view. \"What man were you talking about?\" I clenched the picture, not wanting to look up. I gulped. \"There was a man...\" I looked at the place I had seen the ghost. \"At the top of the stairs. He was pale...he had a gash...\" I hadn't realized I had been whispering. \"His name was Thomas.\" I turned to Tom and tilted my head. \"Thomas? Thomas Sharpe?...You mean the ex husband of Edith Cushing?\" I asked. He nodded still smiling softly. \"He may have married Edith Cushing...but he was in love with Edith's twin sister...\" I paused, trying to remember what I had read when I had done my research. \"I don't remember that part of the story.\" Tom took a step towards me. \"Her name was... iliana Cushing.\" And it was as if a lock had unlocked. Everything rushed to my mind. All these images appeared, every scene, every picture. Every word. Everything. I had memories of iliana Cushing. I looked at Tom and dropped the picture. \"Thomas?\" Tom's smiled the brightest smile I had every seen, stepping up to me he cupping my cheeks tenderly . \"Welcome back...Lina.\" THE END A.N. this is the end. sorry it took me so long. I've been going through a couple of things and I couldn't ever finish it. I had everything planned out already. everything written down, I just couldn't get it typed up sooner. if the ending is confusing, you can PM me and I'll explain.

They'd set up razorwire across the stream nearest the witch's house, the forest too dense for a witch to fly through or for them to chase. It's not a tall spread, three feet instead of six, but it would be enough to split a witch in half or take off her head. Hansel's usually smart enough to remember not to grab a witch's broom when they've done that and, on the occassions he isn't, he ends up in a tree before reaching the wire. Hansel forgets. And there are no trees to catch him.[Chapter 2] Gretel doesn't begin to cry until after she has collected their payment, until after she's witnessed the stream running red with the consequence of her brother's negligence. Edward allows her tears to soak into his shoulder as they make their way deeper into the forest, Hansel's body shrouded safely on the cart. They, and her tears, don't stop until sunset threatens through the trees. Edward is as gentle with Hansel's body as he is with Gretel, large hands softly laying him down on carefully stacked wood. It turns out that burning is the best way to dispose of white witches too. By the flickering light of Hansel's pyre, smoke billowing and bringing tears to her eyes, Gretel opens her mother's grimoire and starts to read.[Chapter 3] Before, folk told tales of two siblings who were hexenfinder, brother and sister who were immune to witches' spells. Similarly, witches whispered among themselves about the lost children of the grand white witch Adrianna, mourning the powers their flesh and bone held. After Augsburg, the tales change and rumours spread that the famed witch hunters are themselves witches. In certain circles it slips that Adrianna's children have been found, that they bite and hunt and cannot be tempted to the dark. Then those tales stop. And the tale of Gretel, grand white witch, starts with the death of her brother.

The anthropomorphic being was glad to be away from the prison camp where he had been confined at hard labor, but wondered if he had just gone from bad to worse in this situation. Hauck cast a questioning eye at his prisoner. \"Fox Plissken,\" he summarized from an official record that he held. \"War hero...decorated numerous times. Sent to prison for slaying half the members of the Westboro Baptist Church.\" Plissken shrugged. \"Seemed a good experiment at the time to see if the half not killed would picket the funerals of those who were,\" he explained. Hauck frowned. \"It's not that I disagree with you, Plissken, but I'm not here to judge. I'm here to offer you a deal.\" \"\"Call me Fox. I'm listening,\" said the anthropomorph, his expression unchanging. \"Fox, Air Force One has been hijacked by terrorists and forced down in New Jersey, which as you know has been a massive national prison camp since 2019. The President was on board, but managed to eject in an escape pod prior to the jet going down. We're able to pick up his life signals on a bracelet locator monitor that he was wearing.\" \"What's that got to do with me?,\" asked the prisoner. You'll be offered a pardon for all your crimes if you retrieve the President,\" explained Hauck. It's your freedom, Plissken.\" \"Alright, I'm in,\" said the fox. \"Some vaccinations, then,\" said Hauck, gesturing to a nearby technician. \"I don't like needles,\" glowered Fox. The technician approached, and held a syringe to either side of his neck. The fox flinched a bit as the injections were made. \"Tell him,\" the technician demanded of Hauck. \"Tell me what?,\" the fox angrily said in response. \"What did you just do to me?!\" \"An encapsulated micro explosive has just been placed in your neck,\" explained Hauck. \"Their coating will slowly dissolve over time, and if the explosives are not neutralized in 24 hours, your carotid arteries will be blown open.\" Fox picked the technician up by his neck and held him in a stranglehold dangling above the floor. \"Take it out!,\" he demanded, enraged. Instantly there was the sound of multiple rifles being cocked and trained on the fox. \"I call the shots here, Plissken,\" said Hauck evenly. \"It's just leverage to keep you on the job and bring you back here with the President,\" Hauck warned. \"Get back here in 24 hours, and you've got nothing to worry about. If you don't, your death is certain.\" Glowering but at a distinct tactical disadvantage, Fox lowered the gasping technician to the floor and the gun muzzles were lowered. Under heavy guard, he was equipped with weapons and guided to the cockpit of a single passenger glider, which was towed by air to the New Jersey border and released at a high altitude. The fox silently piloted the glider by instruments to the location where the President's location monitor revealed him to be situated. \"Plissken!-What's going on?,\" the voice of Hauck demanded to know over the glider's radio. \"I'm playing with myself!,\" snarled Fox sarcastically. \"I'm going in,\" he declared, steering the glider to the roof of the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey. The glider screeched to a halt in darkness mere inches from the edge of a roof on a mall anchor store. Plissken shot a lock from the roof door and descended darkened staircases from there down to the mall's ground floor. Strange humanoid creatures scurried around him but kept a respectful distance once they spied the automatic weapon that Fox held in one paw. Ever mindful of the mutant degenerates nearby, Plissken moved closer to the president' s location as revealed by his scanner. Moving stealthily, Fox came to the center of the mall, an open area which once had held seasonal displays related to Xmas and other approaching seasons. The sound of isolated gunshots caused Fox to freeze behind a pillar, his every instinct focused as he peered cautiously around it. There in a throne-like seat which once held Santa Claus impersonators reposed Donald Trump, clumsily handling a large firearm like a boy with a new toy. His small hands trained the weapon on a chained journalist who hung as a living target on a store front perhaps thirty feet away. The weapon thundered and sent a high-powered slug Into the wall beside the cringing reporter. The minions gathered around Trump roared their appreciation of the spectacle, and the Orange-haired man grinned at their endorsement. It was as if a king was holding court for his adoring subjects. Plissken moved cautiously closer to Trump, his weapon at the ready in case any of the mob made a hostile move towards him. \"Mr. 'President?'\" queried Fox. \"I'm here to get you out.\" The Orange Man looked at Plissken disdainfully. \"I'm not interested in leaving,\" he said firmly. \"Look at these guys!,\" he said gesturing towards the mob. \"They love me here. I'm kind of like their king, and each and every one of them would do anything that I asked them to. There's no special prosecutor here. I've found my niche!\" Plissken looked askance at Trump. \"I heard that 'The Duke of New York' was in charge of this prison colony.\" Trump made a rude noise in response. \"Hell, I AM New York!,\" he loudly declared. \"I've been running New York for years! I ate 'The Duke' for breakfast! What a loser...sad!\" Fox Plissken cocked his head slightly. \"Well, Mr. 'President,' from where I stand, you're exactly where you want and need to be,\" he said in a dry tone. \"Water finds it's own level, I guess. Now if you don't need me, I guess I'll be going.\" The Orange Man waved his would-be liberator away, and went back to pegging shots at the chained journalist. \"I hate these guys!,\" he muttered to the cheers of his adoring crowd. To the departing Plissken, he said, \"Let me know if you ever need a job here.\" \"I work alone,\" intoned Fox Plissken, lighting a cigarette as he walked away, the smoke encircling him in the gathering darkness...

Been really, really busy at work lately. And then ill, really ill. Then work again. Before I knew it, it'd been something like a month and more since I'd updated any of my stories or even been on here. But for now, I am back, and with a new offering. Mostly wrote this because I've been meaning to do something with Hansel and Gretel since I saw the film. Witch Hunters was cheesy, hammy, silly, and I am completely in love with Gemma Arterton. Loved every minute of the silly film and really, really enjoy the relationship between the siblings. Naturally, I wanted to explore that by taking it into socially unacceptable territory, as is my wont. (For the uninitiated, I do not support incest in the real world. It's wrong and a bit nasty. In literature however, I find it makes for some compelling drama and themes.) Anyhoo, the other reason I wrote this was just to get back in the swing of things, haven't written in a while, and writing something fresh was easier than diving right back into Cold War, Broken Lance or To The Lost. Rest assured fans of any of those stories though, they will be resuming updates soon...ish. Anyway, long-ass explanation aside, enjoy! ... Gretel slid down the side of the bank, holding her arms out for balance as her boots cut through the wet mud, kicking up flecks of dirty water and sticky lumps of turf, spattering her skin and face, not that she noticed. The heavy rain that had started that morning continued unabated, plastering loose strands of her hair to her face. She was only grateful she'd managed to get most of it into a braid before they'd left Gaustadt that morning. \"Hansel!\" She cried out, flinging a hand out and grabbing a tree at the bottom of the slope to steady herself, before forcing herself into a loping run through the mud and unslinging the heavy crossbow from her back. A low, throaty roar erupted some way to her right, followed by a splintering crash and what sounded like a tree falling down. As she turned toward it, the shrieking laugh rang out, only to be drowned out by several gunshots. Gretel pushed through the soaking firs, swatting branches aside as she forged ahead. She shoved aside another, only for a second branch to swing back into her face, half-blinding her with water. She spluttered, wiping her eyes on the sleeve of her leather jacket irritably, then glanced upward. Ahead lay a small clearing. Edward loomed over a fallen tree, shaking his fist painfully, covered head to toe in mud and leaves and Hansel struggled to reload his gun, looking equally bruised and bedraggled. The witch struggled to fly above, weighted down by Ben clinging to the end of her broom, still shrieking with laughter. And today had started off so simply. Gretel yanked a hook from the front of her crossbow, attached to a thin, but very strong metal wire. She lashed it around a tree to her left and tugged it back, then coiled the crossbow around another tree to its right. \"Hey, bitch!\" She yelled, too tired, sore and uncomfortable to think of anything better. The witch stopped, finally shaking Ben free who fell to the drenched ground in a splash. She regarded her hungrily, raising her wand and laughing again. \"Gretel!\" Hansel roared, raising his gun and firing at the witch, but it only served to drive the creature toward her. Gretel stepped back from the two trees, as the witch swept forward. She drew a hunting shotgun from her belt, with the barrels sawn down and without bothering to aim, fired. The buckshot hammered into the witch, destroying the front of her broom. She screamed as she lurched forward, eyes widening as she finally noticed the barely visible razor-wire set up between the trees. Gretel closed her eyes as it collided with the wires, followed by a sickening squelch. She cringed as she felt the sticky droplets patter on her face, all too familiar these days with the warm, clinginess of blood coating her face. At least it wasn't hers. The witch thrashed about in front of her, nearly cut in two by the steel-wire. Gretel jammed another two shells into the sawn-off and aimed it at the twitching, fleshy creature. She heard Hansel approach, followed by the lumbering footsteps of Edward and Ben's heavy gasping. Without looking up, she fired twice. The witches head disappeared in a fountain of bloody flesh as the buckshot pulverised it's all too mortal shell. \"Nice, sister.\" Hansel muttered, mopping his now bloody brow. \"Shut up.\" She said, wiping her own face pointlessly. It would take considerable effort to get the combination of rain, mud and blood out…again. \"Dead?\" Edward growled. Hansel turned and clapped the big troll on the shoulder. \"Very.\" He grinned, shooting Gretel a look. She smirked back, wryly, clipping the old shotgun to her belt again. \"We get paid now, right?\" Ben asked, brushing his sopping wet hair out of his eyes. \"We?\" Her brother laughed sharply, seeing the look on Ben's face. \"Sure, sure. Take Edward and fetch the cart, we'll get…uh… it ready.\" He regarded the bloody lumps that remained of the witch. Edward grunted and lumbered off. \"Maybe a sack or something would be a good-\" \"Good idea kid.\" Hansel shoved him off after Edward. \"Oh,\" Ben managed, despite Hansel's insistent pushing. \"Nice work, Gretel!\" He smiled cheerfully. \"Thanks.\" She managed a brief smile as he jogged off after the troll. Hansel thrust a hand into the folds of his leather duster and pulled out a pipe. She watched, amused, as with considerable effort he managed to strike a match and light it. \"So, you got this whole execution thing going now or something?\" His eyes lingered on the shotgun. She looked down at the corpse, then back at her brother. \"It was Jackson's.\" She said, simply. \"I know.\" \"Muriel murdered him, he was just trying to help us.\" Hansel lowered the pipe, strolling around the body over to her. He laid a hand on her arm, looking her in the eyes. \"I liked the old guy, too, but our lives are dangerous enough without making it riskier with…with…poetic justice.\" He frowned slightly. Gretel scoffed. \"I wasn't in any fucking danger.\" She saw the look on his face. \"Any more danger than usual, anyway. And besides, like you're one to give me that talk? Remember how you wound up lost out in the forests around Augsberg to begin with?\" She crossed her arms. \"I…\" Hansel's eyes wandered upward, as he took another draw on the pipe. \"…I might have hitched a ride on a broomstick with one of Muriel's sisters.\" He met his sister's gaze, taking in her unimpressed expression and her raised eyebrow. \"It…might have been poor judgement.\" He conceded. \"Maybe.\" They fell silent for a moment, taking in the battered, beaten and bloody state of one another, before breaking out in a laugh and smiling stupidly. \"You'd think we'd be better at this by now.\" Gretel chuckled, tugging damp, loose strands of hair from her eyes. \"Still alive.\" Her brother shrugged, as if it was nothing. \"Long as it stays that way, it's worth a few bumps.\" \"Yeah, a few bumps.\" She laughed slightly, unconsciously running a hand over some of the older scars and scabs from past injuries on her cheek. It was only a few weeks since they'd left Augsburg, and the wounds from when Sheriff Berringer and his men had- Hansel's brow furrowed at the motion and she saw him wince slightly and look away. She lowered her hand quickly, inwardly cursing. Her brother still hadn't forgiven himself, it seemed, for not being there when it…when they nearly… \"Brother-\" She began, interrupted by a shout from behind them. Ben jogged through the trees, carrying a thick, olive canvas. \"Edward's back there with the cart and our gear, by the road.\" He gasped, catching his breath, then took in the strained silence between the twins. \"Everything okay?\" \"Great.\" Hansel replied, quickly. \"C'mere.\" He gestured Ben over and they began to wrap the bloody corpse in the canvas. With a grunt, the two of them lifted the mass and began heading back towards the slope that led up to the road. Ben might not have noticed anything beyond Hansel's usual snappy demeanour, but Gretel could see he was rattled. She retrieved her crossbow and followed the two, staring at the back of Hansel's head in guilt. He could be such a closed book, sometimes. Not that they weren't close, because they were, always had been. Life had forced them to be so, circumstance had brought them to where they were, side by side as always. They were a team, companions, family. More than family. She knew him better than anybody, and the same went for him, she was sure. But still, her brother had always been…reserved. Before Augsburg, he had refused to discuss their past or their parents. Now having discovered much of the truth of their childhood, their mother a good witch, their resistance to magic, even Gretel's fledgling…potential. Gretel herself was still uncomfortable with the final revelation. Hansel though, reticent before, was now even more so. He blamed himself for what nearly happened to her with the Sheriff, and he likely held himself responsible for Mina's death. Gretel wanted to talk to him about all these things, knowing he was as troubled as she, but he seemed dead set against it. And with Ben and Edward along now, there were few opportunities to broach the topics in private. On top of that, he seemed to be pushing them harder than usual. This was their third witch-kill in the few weeks since defeating Muriel and her coven, along with all the others they slew at the Bloodmoon. He was driving himself, and she was driving herself for fear of what would happen when he finally fell. She hoped it wouldn't end as badly as she feared, in those quiet moments at night, when the others slept. As she scrambled up the muddy, slippery rise, she saw Edward lifting the cart as Hansel finished stowing the corpse. Ben was already walking ahead, trying to check the map while keeping it out of the rain, under his coat. She chucked her crossbow onto the back of the cart, noting that her brother actually flinched as it suddenly flew past him. \"Hansel.\" She said quietly, resting a hand on his shoulder. \"Edward.\" He ordered. The troll grunted and began following Ben. Hansel stepped forward, but she tightened her hold. \"Hey.\" She hissed. \"What?\" He turned back, eyes meeting hers. She wondered whether to tell him it wasn't his fault again, or whether to ask whether he wanted to talk, or whether simply to ask if anything was wrong, but something told her he'd simply clam up again and move on. \"We should take a break.\" She tried to smile reassuringly, settling on a different tack. \"We haven't stopped since we beat Muriel and…\" She glanced ahead toward Edward and Ben. \"…we're only human. Well, most of us.\" He looked like he was going to object, but he must have seen something in her look as his own grim expression faltered and softened, slightly. \"Witches don't stop.\" He argued, though it seemed more of a forced objection than an actual argument. \"Neither will we.\" She let her hand run down his shoulder to his hand, silently thrilled as he took her hand in his and squeezed. His rough-skinned fingers rubbed soothingly over her own coarse, scratched hand. \"But a day or two, just to…to think about things.\" Hansel nodded slightly, picking up the implication. It was true he had been pushing them, it was true he had been trying to put off addressing everything that they'd learned, that had happened since Augsburg. It was true that he'd been afraid to talk to Gretel about these things, even though on some level, he wanted to. There was nobody else to talk to. There was nobody else he would ever consider talking to. It was true he had been less than…less than he should have been, as her brother, in the past weeks. \"A few days couldn't hurt.\" He glanced upward, embarrassed by the small joy in her eyes, the slight smile, as her lips curled upward. He cleared his throat and turned to follow the receding cart, only to find Gretel still holding his hand, remaining beside him. He paused briefly again, before making an awkward growling sound at the back of his throat. Gretel smiled and, still holding his hand, they began the journey back to town.[Chapter 2] Been quite a while, but I felt like revisiting this. Hope it was worth the wait! Dachau was just another cold, wet, muddy sprawl of grey stone and dark wooden buildings, angular and pointed old houses and thick stone walls. Unlike many of the places they had wound up in the years they'd spent hunting witches, however, the population of this particular muddy sprawl was merely passively antagonistic as opposed to outwardly hostile to their presence. Gretel wondered whether Edward had anything to do with the space they were given, these days, too. Gretel followed Hansel out of the mayor's office, a sizeable purse of silver richer than they had been that morning. She caught the bag as her brother tossed it over, carelessly. Despite constantly ribbing Ben about his cut, at the end of a hunt, Hansel cared little about the financial details, generally leaving it all to her. As long as he knew he had enough to keep them armed, supplied and fed, maybe with a little to tinker with their arsenal here and there, he was relatively content. Sometimes she wondered if he even realised how much they had saved up over the years. Considering how easily he spent money on playing with their weaponry, she thought it was probably a good thing one of them had an idea of how to manage a budget. Edward and Ben were stood by their cart, near a stable by the entrance to town. Edward laughed throatily at something Ben was saying, the young man gesturing energetically and grinning. Having the two of them along meant more mouths to feed, but all told she enjoyed their company. Edward was handy in a fight and even Ben was learning, if slowly. Despite her brother's attitude, which could equally rival her own icy demeanour at times, she knew even he didn't mind having them along. She was assured of this because Hansel hadn't insisted they leave Ben behind after their first hunt after leaving Augsburg, when the youth had been picked up by the airborne bitch and hurled at her brother, sending them both tumbling off the side of an incline and into a murky bog below. \"Find us somewhere to eat and sleep?\" Hansel dropped onto the back of the cart, laying back idly. \"Somewhere with a minimum of fleas, rodents and decaying furniture?\" \"Well…\" Ben began, wincing slightly. \"Fuck that, did they have a bath?\" Gretel unslung her crossbow and tossed it onto the cart. It landed on Hansel, who grunted as he caught it. \"Yes.\" Ben nodded. \"They did.\" \"Bath?\" Edward rumbled, inquisitively. \"Then that's our bet.\" She smirked, climbing up onto the side of the cart. \"Lead on, kid.\" Ben smiled, nodding again and headed on. Edward lifted the cart and started to pull, without a word. Sometimes, she felt like they were exploiting the troll, but she wasn't sure how to explain to a creature who'd been grown, bred and conditioned to…obey witches. Which now it turns out meant…her…sort of. Since their mother was…well. Gretel yelped briefly when a hand shot up out of the cart and grabbed her shoulder. It pulled her down into the back awkwardly, her legs still dangling over the side, into the pile of arms, armaments and supplies. She turned her head to find Hansel looking at her with his habitual set frown. \"What?\" She asked, irritably. Hansel didn't reply, his rough fingers brushing across her forehead, pulling hair out of her face and pushing it behind her ear. His expression faltered briefly, softened. His eyes fixed on hers and his mouth opened slightly as though he wanted to say something. He looked past her for a moment, seeing the back of Edward and Ben's heads as they rattled down the street, then back at her, meaningfully. His brow raised and he shrugged. She was confused at first, but as his hand started to caress her face, through the worn leather of his glove, something clicked in the back of her head. Oh. Well. It had…been a while. Quite a long while since they'd last been…what was the word…close? Intimate? Since before Augsburg, must have been. Back when she'd started having the dreams again, about their parents, their father leaving them out in the forest… She caught his hand, as his coarse touch probed around her beaten and bruised face, holding it to her cheek. \"'m sorry, Gretel.\" He murmured. He wasn't all to blame. She knew that. But she'd tried to reach out for months and that wasn't something she was really accustomed to, or comfortable with. She'd tried and Hansel had refused, over and over. He'd let the gap between them get bigger and he'd actually seemed to fortify it, at times. \"Yeah.\" She let go of his hand and lay back, closing her eyes. Gretel could be petty too. … Later that afternoon, they secured rooms at one of the larger taverns in Dachau. Dimly, Hansel conceded it was better than some they'd been stuck in. Ben had his own room, he'd persuaded the owner to let Edward shack up in the stable, and that he wouldn't eat the horses, and then taken another room for themselves. Ben had never commented on the fact they always shared a room. Because, well, it must have seemed at least a bit odd, right? Hansel couldn't decide whether the kid was just clueless, naïve, or tactful. Not that they'd actually been any more than the brother and sister they seemed, for a while. Mostly his doing. Those fucking dreams had spooked him, when they'd started up again. It had been years since the last time, they'd still practically been kids. But right before they arrived in Augsburg, following the stories about all the children missing, they'd started up again. He'd never told Gretel. Not even when she told him she'd had them, in their room in the tavern, the first night in Augsburg. He'd just shut her out, ignored it and pushed on. We don't talk about that, he'd said. He and Gretel had never really been much for expressing their feelings and worries and concerns…vocally at least. They'd found other ways. Maybe, in this case though…maybe he should have? Hansel took another swig from the tankard. Foul smelling stuff. Warmed him up, though. Ben was sat across the table from him, poring over several sheets of paper and talking away, half to himself, half to Hansel. Stories and rumours about witch-sightings. Always seemed to be more. Hansel's tired and aching bones protested at the thought of chasing another witch down already. Maybe they did need a break. Gretel was upstairs in their room. Having a bath. His mind lingered on that for a moment. In retrospect, he had earned the somewhat cold shoulder she'd been giving him recently. Well, a lot, really. While Berringer and his men had been attacking her, he'd…he'd been with Mina. Not that it was Mina's fault either. Another victim. Another weight on his already twisted conscience. A good witch. Hansel had never thought there could be such a thing, after all he and Gretel had seen, over the years. All they'd fought and killed. But there it was. He had to believe it now. Now he knew about their mother. And Mina. If he didn't, what did that make Gretel? They both had the blood of a witch, but Gretel…Gretel apparently had the capacity to…learn. To be one. He spun the tankard idly in his hand, staring into the sloshing depths. Hansel knew he'd die before he let anything happen to her again. He'd die before he let anyone try to take her away. She was no monster. She was not evil. Dimly, he wondered if that was how their father had felt about their mother…or them. Years of anger, blame, hatred…it all seemed so wasted now. So unfair. Hacking that bitch Muriel's head off had done some to make him feel better, though. Gretel hadn't really talked about it since. Or…maybe she'd tried and he'd ignored her, again. The last month or so since Augsburg were a bit of a blur. An unending stream of slain witches, injuries, bloodshed and treks through dark woodland and rugged terrain. The barmaid strolled past again, throwing him a smile. He suspected he was probably in with a shot, there. Gretel had never forbidden him other…distractions, over the years. And he'd definitely not denied himself. But he'd never seen Gretel with anybody else. Made him feel guilty. A lot of things made him feel guilty. He knocked back the last of the foul-tasting swill and let the tankard clatter onto the table. \"I'm off.\" Hansel burped, pounding his chest. \"Get some rest, kid.\" He grabbed his coat from the back of his chair and threw it over his shoulder, and plucked a bread roll from the platter on the table. \"Sure…uh, hey, was Gretel okay earlier?\" Ben asked, worriedly. Hansel fought the urge to scoff. Ben had a good heart, that was all. Gretel said so, so it must have been true. \"She gets tired too.\" Hansel shrugged. \"We ain't all the stories say we are. Sleep tight.\" He smirked, snapped off a bit of bread and threw it at Ben's head then went upstairs. … When Hansel opened the door Gretel was still in the tub, clearly enjoying herself, with her back to him in the middle of the room. \"Top us up, brother?\" She called, without turning around. \"Sure.\" He tossed his coat onto a hook next to Gretel's and strolled over to the fire, where several pots of water were boiling away. He grabbed one and carried it toward the large metal tub. Gretel was watching him lazily, arms resting on the sides and head leaned back. \"Edward happy?\" She asked, as he poured the water into the tub. \"Yeah. Left him with a leg of mutton and a mound of hay. Seemed…whatever the troll equivalent of being happy is I guess.\" Gretel let out a contented sigh as the water warmed around her, and she let her arms drop inside the tub. He couldn't make her out through the dark surface of the water, only seeing the pale skin of her neck and shoulders above it. Maybe that was for the best. \"Ben?\" She asked again. \"The kid is…well, he's nuts, Gretel.\" Gretel gave him a sharp look, as he knelt down beside the tub, pouring the last of the water in. \"…but…he'll…learn?\" Hansel fumbled, hopefully. Gretel sat back again, eyes staring into the dark water. \"We did.\" She said, quietly. Hansel rolled up the sleeves of his shirt and unbuttoned his vest, throwing it onto the bed across the room. Gretel's eyes moved back to him, slightly guarded. He crossed his arms, leaning on the side and took in the state of her, now there was time. Her cuts were starting to heal, those he could see, and her skin has a healthier flush in the heat of the water, more colour than usual. Bruises were setting in though, and there was still blood on her that she hadn't quite washed off. \"Why are we staring?\" Gretel asked, staring right back at him. \"You're filthy.\" Hansel smirked, breaking off some bread and popping it into his mouth. \"Blood…lingers.\" Gretel winced. He saw her eyes go to the bread. \"Don't we know it.\" He replied, wondering whether she was partly talking about something else. About them. Their blood. The years of blood on their hands. The look she gave him told him she was. He broke off another bit and held it up. Gretel grinned and opened her mouth. He flicked it and she caught it, chewing it slowly. He did it again, flicking another piece at her which she caught in her mouth, stretching her neck to reach it slightly. \"Feel like a fuckin' duck.\" She grumbled, chewing. \"Swan, maybe.\" He muttered, his eyes lingering on the largely unscarred, smooth skin of her neck, curving downward to her submerged chest. Gretel snorted, then laughed. \"That ever work, brother?\" She smirked. \"How the hell do you manage to get laid at all?\" \"Think they feel sorry for me.\" Hansel grinned back. \"I feel sorry for you, Hans.\" Gretel replied. \"Good.\" Hansel set aside the bread and picked up a cloth by the side of the tub. \"Want any help?\" \"Washing?\" Gretel asked, raising one brow. \"Fuck, I thought you'd never get around to asking.\" \"Yeah, I'm bad at this.\" He nodded, moving behind his sister. She leaned forward, lifting her arms and beginning to untie her hair from its long braid. Hansel helped. It was…an intimate thing, for Gretel. Private. She mostly always did it herself. That she was prompting him to take part meant that…maybe…he was fixing things? A little at least? \"You're going to make me ask the other thing aren't you?\" Hansel said, rubbing the damp cloth down the back of her neck. \"Yeah.\" \"Never did before.\" He ventured. Their relationship, their…bond…whatever it was, had survived for years mostly being intuitive. It thrived on saying \"I love you\" as little as possible, because they already knew that. As brother and sister and more or less or whatever else they were to each other. Trust, respect, they could only really count on each other, after all. The first time they'd had sex they'd just turned sixteen. It had been awkward, clumsy, slightly scary, and neither of them really knew what they were doing. The first time they'd realised they were looking at each other, thinking about each other like brothers and sisters didn't normally was some years earlier. Went back a bit. Maybe all the way back to that night, with the witch. Their first kill. Left alone. Nobody but each other to rely on. Some things never really changed. \"I said I was sorry about…this.\" Hansel gestured, helplessly. He didn't have a fucking clue how to talk about this. Gretel half-turned, her dark eyes meeting his as she ran her hands through her hair, slowly washing it. \"It worked for years, somehow. But you wanted to stop. And you wouldn't even tell me why.\" There was a hard edge to her voice. Barely there, but noticeable. He really didn't want to fuck this up. Hansel sighed, taking the end of her hair in his hands and carefully washing it. \"I started having the dreams too. Week or so before we got to Augsburg.\" Gretel stiffened slightly, but didn't reply. \"Freaked me out. Saw how they got to you, and just figured it'd be better if we just…focused on other things for a while.\" He shrugged, even though he knew she couldn't see it. \"Seems pretty fuckin' stupid now.\" \"Yeah.\" Gretel nodded, still facing away from him. Hansel soaked the cloth and started running it down the back of her hair again. She was going to make this as uncomfortable as possible. \"Am I,\" He cleared his throat, awkwardly. \", sleeping on the floor tonight?\" It was a given that Gretel had the bed. Gretel always had the bed. Gretel pulled away, turning around in the tub and gripping the sides with her hands. She tilted her head slightly, damp strands of hair plastered across her face as she chewed her lip, thinking. \"Close as I'm gonna get, isn't it?\" She said, staring at him. \"I did say sorry, too.\" Hansel replied, letting his arms slide into the tub. His fingers brushed against her legs in the water. \"You did.\" He was surprised when Gretel slid forward to the edge of the tub, grabbing the collar of his shirt and pressing her lips hard against his. Tasted like blood, dirt and sweat. Something indisputably Gretel. \"Floor looks cold.\" She murmured, pulling back slightly. \"Wouldn't want you to get ill.\" \"Agreed.\" Hansel managed, breathing out. \"So you want out now or…\" Hansel gestured toward a blanket over a chair by the fire. \"I could still use some help though.\" Gretel frowned slightly. \"With what?\" He replied, turning back. \"This.\" Gretel replied, tightening her hold on his shirt and suddenly pulling back to the other side of the tub, taking him with her. He had a second to take a breath before he was hauled over the side face first into the tub. Hansel floundered for purchase, gripping the sides and struggling above the surface, coughing and spluttering. \"Fucking hell, Gretel.\" He rasped, rubbing water out of his eyes as his sister came into focus in front of him. She was smiling. \"If you thought you were getting in that bed in your state, think again.\" Gretel smirked, pushing a hand through his sopping wet hair. \"Your turn.\" She started unbuttoning his soaking shirt. Hansel considered arguing, as he allowed her to remove his drenched shirt. Then she leaned forward, onto her knees, and rose partway out of the tub. His eyes followed the sliding droplets of water down from her neck, toward her breasts. Gretel followed his eyes and paused, looking down at him. She sighed. \"You're hopeless.\" She scoffed, grabbing his hands and placing them on her chest. \"Pretty much.\" He ran one of his hands down the scarred, bumpy skin of her side. Gretel seemed satisfied, and kissed him again. \"I don't suppose-\" He started, as she pulled back again. \"Later.\" Gretel smirked, then poured a pot of water over his head.[Chapter 3] The plot...what there is of it...thickens! That and more violence. And sex. Gretel cried out as he hit her again. She couldn't fall though, the men holding her wouldn't let her. They only pulled her upright again, ignoring the fact she could barely stand, as he hit her again. She spat out a sticky glob of blood. God, felt like her mouth was swimming in it. She tried to swallow, but the sickly mess stuck in her throat. Berringer circled her, leering, gloating. He leaned close, his face twisted and angry and covered in blood from where she'd tried to bite his broken nose right off. She glared back, and for her trouble, he clouted her across the face again with the back of his hand. One of the men holding her took the trouble to elbow her in the side and she felt the breath rush out of her. She retched a mouthful of blood up, struggling for air. Gretel looked up, with difficulty, hanging limp in the men's arms. Berringer laughed. His men sneered. Gretel was afraid. The sherriff's hand was suddenly clamped around her throat, squeezing tighter and tighter. Crushing her. She fought for breath, rasped, snarled, struggled. Her coat was torn off and arms pulled at her outer-corset. It seemed as if he was on top of her now. His men were gone, or elsewhere, laughing. Berringer struggled with the belt of his trousers and pinned her down, while still crushing her neck in his hands. She couldn't breathe. But her right arm was free, now. \"Hansel.\" She gasped. \"Han-\" \"-sel!\" Gretel drove her fist into her attacker's stomach, then elbowed them in the side of the head, sending them tumbling off of her and over the side of the bed onto the floor. \"…rrrnngggh…Gretel…what the fuck…\" Hansel groaned, from the floor. Gretel stared around in the dark, wide-eyed and a little frantic as the last wisps of the dream…nightmare faded. She could feel it again. Something…in here with them. Some lingering feeling, like being watched. The hand at her throat released its grip…her own hand. She sat up quickly, swinging her legs over the side and panting heavily. Her hand kept instinctively going to feel her throat but she couldn't bring herself to touch it after what she'd done in her sleep. Hansel rolled over on the floor, into her feet and she struggled not to flinch. Gretel frowned. Shit like this didn't normally get to her, and she didn't like to admit it, but that dream had rattled her. She slid down onto the floor, helping Hansel up as he sat back against the bed beside her. \"If I'd known you were gonna do that I might've kept the floor.\" He grumbled. \"You never used to have nightmares, did you?\" \"Only the ones about our parents.\" She replied, staring blankly into the dark. \"But they weren't like this.\" Something was wrong. The feeling wasn't going away this time. They weren't alone. It had been about a week since they'd arrived in Dachau. And despite some rumblings from Hansel, they'd managed to take a break, enjoying the opportunity to relax and recuperate. Eat and drink. Not worry about anything. Then a few nights ago, Gretel had had the nightmare. Woke up violently, gasping and struggling, Hansel fighting to calm her. Then the next night too. And the next. And tonight. It had been so sudden. Out of nowhere. \"Gretel.\" Hansel murmured, pulling her out of her thoughts. Hansel's hand was on her bare thigh, slowly moving upward, between her legs. He'd leaned over and kissed her neck, his breath warming her, the stubble of his shaven face scratching her skin, not unpleasantly. He was trying to cheer her up, and she appreciated it, if nothing else. It was tempting to relax and go along with it, but…something was wrong. It was distracting her. \"Wait.\" She replied, quietly. Hansel stopped. Gretel slowly brought her breathing under control. Hansel leaned against her, fumbling for one of her hands. She took it gratefully. Something about this felt all wrong. It was all too sudden. Too…real. And she could still feel it, whatever it was, out there in the dark of their room, with them. And the window was open. \"You okay?\" Hansel asked, trying to catch her eye. \"Fine.\" She replied, curtly. \"Listen.\" She held her breath and brought up her other hand flat, indicating for him to do the same. The room was silent. Still. Dark. But too much. It was the kind of silence, stillness, you got when someone, like they were, was trying to be quiet, and still. \" Fuck .\" Gretel heard her brother hiss through his teeth. \"Trousers.\" Gretel muttered. Hansel passed them over and she started pulling on the leather breeches, slowly. \"Shirt.\" Hansel murmured back. She reached behind her and passed his shirt over. He pulled it on while she finished buckling her belt. \"Shotgun?\" Gretel whispered, slowly edging herself up to her feet, pushing against the bed. \"By the door.\" Hansel replied, buttoning his shirt. \"Rifle?\" He asked, getting up carefully beside her. \"Window.\" She replied, tersely. They shared a brief, plain look, and reached for Gretel's boots, left by the foot of the bed. Each pulled a long knife from a holster in the inner-lining. The witch, whatever or whoever it was, hadn't reacted yet. Gretel hoped that considering they were in the dark, the bitch wasn't relying on sight. Maybe sound. They could work with that. \"Gretel.\" Hansel hissed. \"Give me the other knife.\" She whispered back, through her teeth. \"Get your rifle.\" \"Gretel-\" Gretel rolled her eyes and grabbed a handful of Hansel's shirt, kissing him hard. She used his surprise to take his knife and pulled away, facing across the room. She didn't know where the witch was, but hurled the knife toward the small dead fire. Something shrieked, and the room was briefly illuminated by light when the blast from a wand shimmered and sparked, fizzling toward them. Gretel had a second or so to see the intruder. A twisted, hunched over old creature, wrapped in rags and furs with no eyes and an alarming number of teeth. This witch had either forgotten that magic couldn't harm them or panicked, either way, it had given them some time. \"Go!\" Gretel yelled, running toward the door. Behind her, she heard Hansel move to the window. The witch snarled, going after her brother. Gretel swore under her breath and threw the second knife. The witch cried out, her throw having at least hit something, and another wave of shimmering light flew toward her, passing her harmlessly and turning the wall behind her into stone. It creaked and cracked and the petrified segment caved outward, leaving a large hole. Gretel made it to her gear, grabbing her leg harness and drawing Jackson's shotgun as the witch bore down on her. She could hear the air rushing and the creature hissing angrily. She spun around, silently glad she and her brother made a point of keeping their weapons loaded at all time, raising the shotgun and gave it both barrels. The room was illuminated again in the flashes, and the stench of gunpowder filled her senses. The witch disappeared in the explosion of the first shot, violently cartwheeling backwards into the far wall. The second shot knocked the witch back again, screaming and gurgling blood and stunning her as she scrabbled to get away. Gretel took her time reloading, pushing two more shells into the breech, because she'd already seen Hansel with had found his rifle. \"Get you for thissss!\" The witch screamed, crawling hurriedly toward the open window, where her brother was waiting, quietly. \"Good luck with that.\" Gretel smirked, walking toward her. She picked up a lamp from the table on the way, lighting it. The room was washed in a dull, orange glow. Hansel had his rifle aimed directly at the witches head and it didn't look like she could even tell, as she struggled up, trying to back out of the window. The witch was blind. A stained, torn old rag pulled across where her eyes would be. Skin cracked and discoloured. Long, pointed teeth and unnaturally long fingers, with claws, more than nails. Dreamseers. Not many of them still around. And they freaked Gretel the fuck out every time. \"One chance.\" Gretel snarled. \"What did you want?\" The witch hissed through her teeth, snapping forward, clawed hands outstretched. Beside her, unflinching, Hansel fired twice. The witches head disappeared in an explosion of flesh, sticky blood and fragments of skull. Unfortunately, before the witches headless corpse hit the floor, much of it plastered itself over Gretel. \"Thanks, brother.\" Gretel raised an arm, mopping her face with her sleeve. \"Sorry.\" Hansel let his rifle rest over his shoulder, grinning apologetically. The door to their room burst open and Ben, followed by the owner, a barmaid, and several other guests and patrons crowded in, curiously, if a little hesitant. \"What…what happened?\" Ben stared from them, to the still-twitching, leaking corpse slumped beneath the window. \"What is that?!\" The innkeeper demanded, pointing to the dead…thing. Gretel turned back to the corpse, when she noticed something. A shadow, cast by the moon outside over the body. She stared sharply outside. \"It's-\" Hansel began, when she grabbed his shoulder. On the roof across the street, was a figure. Outlined against the clear sky. Too dark to see any details but. It was moving, she thought, its arm was- \"Get down!\" Gretel threw herself at her brother, as the entire window, and the wall along with it, caved inward in a sea of splinters, shards and debris. \"Witches!\" Someone cried among the guests. \"Witches!\" More were yelling. Gretel rubbed her ears, which were ringing. Hansel was on his back, beneath her, looking torn between amusement and irritation. \"Always gotta land on me?\" He grumbled. Gretel felt one of his hands slyly making its way up her hip toward her ass. \"Hardly the time.\" She muttered rolling off of him quickly. \"Suppose so.\" He threw her a stupid grin as Ben rushed forward, helping them up. \"Are you alright? You look-\" Ben asked, worriedly, holding her arm. \"Great.\" She replied, waving a hand dismissively. The second figure was long gone, when Gretel looked out the new hole in the wall where the window had once been. The cold night air blasted through like a gale, but for a moment she swore she could hear something like laughter, carried on the wind. \"She's just annoyed because she wasted a bath.\" Hansel shouldered Ben, smirking. \"Shut up.\" Gretel scowled, trying to wipe more drying blood from her face. The innkeeper and the others bustled in behind them, staring at the wreckage in a mixture of fear and awe. She figured they had seconds before questions started getting asked. Like what the fuck brought witches all the way into town? Why did they happen to attack the only two witch-hunters around? Say, there weren't any witches before you turned up, is this your fault? They'd seen it all before. Something brought the witches here. And for once, Gretel had a suspicion it might have been them. She'd had the nightmares for a few nights, which meant the Dreamseer had been using her nightmares to look for something in her head all that time. Could have killed them, and didn't. What were they after? Didn't know. Had they found it already? Probably not, since they interrupted the witch tonight, in pretty severe terms. They needed time to work this out. And they had at least one lead, she glared out across the rooftops again. In the street below Gretel heard slow, lumbering footsteps. Edward was up and about. She heard him sniff the air, patiently, then turn to look up at the hole in the building, where she was standing. \"Witches.\" Edward grumbled, uneasily. \"Thanks, Edward.\" Gretel managed a smile. \"Wait there, we'll be down in a bit.\" The crowd was already muttering. Some looked worried, some suspicious. Some angry. \"Hansel.\" Gretel shot her brother a look. He nodded, understanding, and turned toward the crowd. \"People,\" Hansel held up a hand, speaking in his best 'authority' voice. \", it would appear you have a witch problem.\" It was a half-truth, at least.

Taylor wasn't much for them and never had been. Part of Snake was up for heading home. Sturgis wasn't far from Deadwood, a place he hadn't been since he saw his parents' bodies two years earlier. He tried not to think about that as he rode in from the East. More and more bikers were showing up along the highway. Finally, in Illinois he pulled over at a huge bonfire. A long line of bikes were parked along the shoulder of the road and he smelled food. Snake wondered if he could buy something to eat here. It looked promising. The group was the usual mix of overly drunk, faux badasses, two-bit whores and an occasional glimpse at someone who probably could beat all the rest of them in a fight... at once. It was to be expected and Snake didn't much care. They didn't bother him any aside from the occasional pass by a whore he wouldn't touch if paid to. Snake got what he thought was chicken. Even if it wasn't he decided he was hungry enough to pretend it was anyway. With a beer in hand he made his way toward the fire and away from the crowd bunched up by the booze. He wanted company. Taylor was always around and without him he felt a bit off. All these gaudy asses and fake bikers held no appeal to him. Plissken broke into where he could see more of the crowd and took a gander at a place to sit and enjoy his food. Eventually his eye settled on a younger woman down by the fire. She wasn't dressed like the others. Plain but functional boots, black leathers, red t-shirt and a riding jacket beside her. What made him smile was the bright orange bandana she wore. She was very attractive too which was an added bonus to any company. Two guys seemed to be talking to her but she looked very upset by it. Snake made his way over to her and the guys were still there. Snake was not in the mood. \"Is there room on this log for someone else?\" He addressed the girl and ignored the men. He listened though and was trying to figure out what they were saying. The conversation obviously had gone on too long for him to catch up. \"We were here first.\" Snake looked up at them. \"Didn't see you.\" They all bristled and Plissken shifted. His coat fell away from where he had it pulled closed. In the firelight the gun he was carrying became painfully visible. That backed them down enough that Snake sat on the log beside the younger woman. Maybe she was his age now that he had a look but she was still worth sitting with. \"Do you always meet people like this?\" She had a smile that said she was teasing him. \"Gets good karma and good company, why not?\" Snake sipped his beer and set it down between his feet. \"Don't tell me, you're drunk too.\" She seemed disgusted but after what he had seen from her previous company Snake could let it slide. \"Only if carrying it gets me wasted sweetheart.\" Snake smiled and took a bite of what he imagined was chicken. Once he took a bite he knew it wasn't but he ignored it. The girl next to him laughed quietly. \"That would be a good beer.\" \"Sure would.\" Snake smiled and moved his beer so he could sit on the ground and lean back on the log. He needed to stretch his legs. \"I'm Analise.\" He saw a hand come down toward him and he shook it. \"Snake.\" He really was almost too involved in eating for company but he wasn't about to ignore her after working to get those other asses away from her. \"Interesting name.\" Snake smiled and shrugged. \"What were those two fucks going on about?\" Snake was too curious to let well enough alone. \"I don't have breasts because of cancer.\" He caught her shrug but Snake felt fury in his stomach. There were things he wouldn't abide by. \"They should be glad I didn't know.\" Plissken couldn't help but be angry. He didn't know if it was because she was a woman or the hell he dealt with because of his patch. Maybe it was a bit of both. \"It doesn't bother me.\" She slid down to sit next to him on the ground as she answered. \"Shouldn't. I came over here to talk to you.\" Snake was flirting. He couldn't help himself when he was around a pretty girl. Analise giggled beside him. \"Flirt.\" She accused all too playfully. \"In my opinion.\" Snake took a long look around at all the other women. \"No breasts are lot hotter than all these fake ones around here.\" That took the giggles into full blown laughter. Even Snake genuinely smiled which was very rare if at all in the past two years. \"Are you always this charming?\" \"Only around the really pretty ones.\" Snake grinned at her before taking a drink of his beer. \"You are a sweet talking flirt.\" Analise shoved him a bit with her shoulder. Plissken had been feeling so old since the war. Losing everyone and caring for Taylor in the state he was in had taken its toll. Right now all that faded away. It was a nice feeling. \"Never said I wasn't sweetheart.\" Snake finished his beer off and set the empty glass aside. \"I like it in a man.\" She smiled and never seemed to stop. He was curious about her sickness but didn't have the heart to ask with her mood being so good. \"Does Snake have a woman he likes to charm more than the others?\" Snake looked away for a second determined not to let the war get to him for just one night. \"Not really though I might have found one to charm a bit extra.\" \"Is she here?\" Snake couldn't tell if she was teasing or curious. \"Yeah she is.\" Snake figured he was going to tease back until he discovered otherwise. \"Tell me about her.\" \"She's got nice legs and a gorgeous smile.\" Snake left a pause and leaned over to whisper. \"And she ain't got no tits either.\" She looked over at him and all he could do was smirk smugly. She seemed flattered, shocked and off-guard all at once. Plissken laughed and laid back against the log to look up at the sky. \"Do you know her?\" Snake was having more fun than he had in years. \"It better not be me.\" The shock was still in her voice. \"Why?\" Snake made eye contact and she just dissolved into giggles. \"You going to keep being this pretty?\" Snake hadn't had it in mind when he sat down but he was really attracted to her. His desire for someone to talk to was turning to a bit more than that. \"Are you going to keep flirting?\" She asked. \"Of course.\" Snake shifted and pulled one leg up. He could relax here. The cops could come but he could be long gone by the time they managed to wade through all these bikers. It gave him a sense of peace he hadn't had in awhile. \"What did you ride in on?\" \"An Indian. You have to have a Harley.\" \"Why is that?\" Snake laughed a bit. \"Seems like your style.\" She had gotten comfortable sitting sideways to face Snake with one arm propped up on the log and her head resting on her hand. \"1990 Softtail.\" Snake smiled. \"Just painted her in flames.\" \"No snakes?\" She was back to prodding at him. Not that he minded. \"I save those for the tattoos.\" Snake sighed. \"Yes, I got the name before the tattoos.\" She giggled. \"How many do you have?\" \"Three.\" \"Can I see them?\" Analise asked. \"Can I see your legs?\" Snake countered. \"See them?\" She lifted her one leg up over him and then got comfortable again. Plissken rolled his eye and laughed as he pulled his shirt up to show his stomach. \"That had to hurt.\" She seemed rather sympathetic. She touched the hood of the cobra and Snake shivered. That attraction was getting worse. He really didn't want her to stop touching his stomach. \"Like fire sweetheart.\" Snake smiled and yawned. \"It's not that late.\" She yawned too. \"Don't know about you but I've been driving since 8 am. I could use some sleep.\" Snake could sleep right here if he wasn't so worried about being stepped on. \"Why don't you head to bed? I'll be fine out here.\" She finally took her hand away from his skin so he could put his shirt down. \"Why don't you come with me?\" Snake was playing all his charm into those words. \"I don't…\" Snake pressed a finger to her lips and smiled. \"Promise I won't touch you… well I don't promise that but you got no breasts to worry about me getting all over and no hands down between the legs. Your ass, well I can't promise to keep my hands off but promise nothing else unless you start it.\" Snake was working hard on this one. He really wanted to kiss her. He wanted to more than anything. He decided it had to be the fact she was just a woman, not a whore, not a professional, just a woman. He craved that like a drug. Snake let his finger slip away from her lips. She seemed to trust him. He could see it but also the hesitation. \"I got a sleeping bag on the bike. We can sleep under the stars and you won't have to worry about any of these fuck ups bothering you all night.\" Slowly she grinned and nodded. \"Alright, but no funny business.\" \"I can be innocent when I want to be.\" \"Do you expect me to believe that?\" She laughed watching him get up. \"No. How about that I can keep my word?\" Snake offered his hand to help her up. \"That I can believe.\" She took his hand and stood up. \"Good.\" Snake knew this was going to be a night of hell but he had all week plus at the rally. One day of hell would be worth spending the rest of them with her. \"I'm going to the bike. I'll be right back.\" Snake smirked to himself as he sauntered off. Damn he was good and it felt invigorating to feel his age again. ","Summary":" Snake headed out to the rally alone. Taylor wasn't much for them and never had been.

The twins were nestled in the back of the double stroller and Mason was firmly strapped in the front. Cassie was there with them holding on to his arm as he approached the building in Sioux Falls. He had the kids for the day and decided the Journey Museum might be a place to try. They had to have kids stuff there and he wanted to go back. The last time he'd seen it was when he was Cassie's age. Once inside he was glad to see that most of the exhibits still had the same touchable artifacts and all the activities. He rolled the stroller up to the main desk and smiled. \"One adult, one child, three under two.\" Snake was rather cheerful today and the woman behind the counter gave him an odd look when he declared the children. She focused for a long moment on the patch. Her eyes roved over the black leather trench coat, pants and the dark shirt before glancing farther down at the children. Cassie slipped between her father and the stroller while they waited. \"You have to check the stroller.\" Snake took his ticket stubs after handing over cash. His eye was firmly on the three in the stroller. He hadn't planned on this but he could make it work. The woman was pointing over to a desk around the side. Sighing he dutifully pushed the stroller over to the side. Rummaging in his very masculine diaper bag he pulled out the sling, wrapped it and knelt down again. The woman behind this counter was staring like he'd kidnapped the children. Snake just rolled his eye. Next he pulled the baby pack on and buckled it. \"Cassie, sweetie, will you get Mason for me?\" She happily went and came back struggling a little with the heavy toddler. \"Put him up in the pack.\" Snake sat Indian style on the floor so Cassie could help him. Both of the women were staring now. The one out front was out for behind the counter to look. Ignoring them Snake buckled Mason in then positioned both twins in the sling. The diaper bag over his shoulder and Cassie's hand in his he pushed the stroller to the window. \"Got to check my stroller.\" The woman just stared. Mason was leaning in balancing his bottle on the side of Plissken's head. Snake didn't even notice and cleared his throat. The woman sprang into motion and presented him with a red ticket. The other end wrapped on the handle of the stroller that she took into a side room. Snake wasn't sure he was happy with the staff. Not that he was often happy with many people. Snake smiled and glanced down at Cassie when they got to the map. \"Where should we go first?\" She milled it over while Snake committed the map to memory. \"Here\" She pointed to the botanical gardens. Plissken smiled. \"Can we stop here first?\" Snake pointed out the geology and fossil hall. With a nod they were on their way. Snake wanted to see the whole museum but this wing was a start and on the way to the gardens. Cassie was interested in everything. Snake read signs with her and they talked as much as she wanted about the exhibits. Mason had passed out on his back and the twins were quiet so it was more or less the two of them. At the end there was a place where kids could dig for bones. As soon as Cassie got excited Snake shrugged and sat to pull off his boots. The sand pit was filled with bones, gems and other things for the children to find. Shoes off Snake waited with Cassie to be let in. Another woman showed up with a little girl, younger than Cassie. Snake was in the sand, pulled along by his daughter who handed him a shovel. Snake laughed and helped her dig up a bone she'd seen in the sand. The woman joined them at the other end of the pit. For the first time since he arrived someone looked at him like he wasn't a freak or a criminal. It was a nice feeling. \"It looks like you have you hands full.\" Snake chuckled as he sat back letting Cassie rummage through the sand and pile the things up in his lap. \"I manage.\" \"I can see that.\" She smiled and sat back with him on the bench. \"She's adorable.\" \"So is yours.\" Snake nodded over at the dark haired girl trying to pull up a leg bone from the sand. They sat for a long time watching the girls before the woman beside him broke the silence. \"You wife's a lucky woman. I don't know many men who would take on these four.\" Plissken was feeding Steven when he looked up and grinned. \"My wife always says I'm just another kid causing trouble in the house.\" She laughed and shook her head. \"I can see it.\" \"She your only?\" Snake asked just keeping up the friendly conversation. \"For now. She'll have a sibling in a few months.\" Snake glanced down where her hand was on her stomach. There was barely a bump but enough to make him smile. \"We were thinking of a few more.\" \"Four is more than I could handle.\" \"I have five.\" Snake patted Mason's hand where he was slumped on Snake's shoulder. \"This one is my grandson.\" The woman looked surprised. \"You don't look that old.\" \"Thanks for the compliment.\" By this time Cassie was coming over and ready to leave. \"Looks like I'm back on the road.\" \"Seems that way.\" She smiled at Cassie who shied away a little. \"Have fun.\" \"You too.\" Snake got out and sat to put on his shoes. \"She's pretty.\" Cassie commented innocently. Snake wasn't sure how to handle the question. \"Yeah but not as pretty as your mothers.\" Plissken was up and waiting for Cassie when she slid off the bench. It was a little bit of a walk to the Botanical Gardens that were part of the museum. Cassie was getting tired. Before they made it through the prairie exhibit she wanted carried. Snake obliged working her in on his hip on Mia's side. There was room since she was smaller. He walked through the rainforest but by the time they reached the cacti Cassie stopped responding. She was asleep. Snake turned and left the gardens. He took his time walking through the Native American and Sioux displays carrying all four along the way. It was a workout that made him laugh when he thought about all the military backpacking training. They always said that all the skills would apply some way to life. This was the last place we would have imagined. Even Plissken started getting tired. The women back at the counter stared the whole time he went to retrieve the stroller from the little window in the back. If he wasn't so tired he would have told them off. Snake maneuvered out to the Humvee and strapped the four into their seats. Mia with a bottle and Cassie was squirming. \"Daddy?\" \"What is it sweetie?\" Snake was looking in the rearview mirror as he strapped on his seatbelt. \"I liked the museum.\" She yawned and he could tell she was about to go back to sleep. \"I'm glad. We'll have to go to more of them together.\" Snake grinned and started the drive home. He was barely out of the lot before they were all back asleep. IT would be a quiet drive home today.

It was horrible. Couldn't they just shoot him so he didn't have to listen? \"And especially no women, unless you're married.\" Malloy reiterated as he stood in front of Plissken. Snake couldn't help but smirk. His good sense said one thing but the desire to taunt the police said quite another. He lifted his hand slowly between the two of them and wiggled his ring finger in front of Malloy's face. \"Think you need to clear my record.\" The shock in the cop's expression was too much and Snake almost laughed despite the forced cool he was presenting. \"How long have you been married?\" \"Long enough.\" Snake answered with a shrug as he pulled out a cigarette. \"Who is she?\" Malloy moved closer as Plissken lit his cigarette with a match. \"Wouldn't you like to know?\" Snake answered quietly around the cigarette. \"Who is she?\" \"A woman.\" Snake pulled the cigarette away and grinned and he puffed out a trail of smoke into the night air. \"I know that.\" Malloy seemed to finally focus on the smoking. \"The United States is a no smoking nation.\" Plissken shrugged. \"Way I see it I'm already busted so why not smoke?\" Malloy reached out to take the cigarette away as Plissken moved to take another drag. Snake slapped his hand away like a bad child who was pestering a parent. \"Show him why he needs to comply.\" Rifles came up from a relaxed position but just as quickly Plissken drew and shoved his revolver into Malloy's throat. \"Dogs got guns on me.\" Snake blew smoke into Malloy's face watching him choke. \"Did you forget who I am?\" Snake growled the words out. \"Shoot him.\" Malloy's words gargled. \"Go ahead. I'll pull this trigger before I die.\" Snake stared right into Malloy's eyes drawn by the hint of terror he saw there. Malloy waved his hands for the others to lower their rifles. Reluctantly his squad lowered their weapons. Snake took a step back leaning on a lamp post as he retracted the gun from Malloy. Slowly he holstered it watching the rest but his left hand hovered there like any gunfighter expecting the need to draw. Snake had a plan. They were backing right into it. He was back to lazily puffing on his smoke while Malloy collected himself again. \"We know who she is.\" \"Who, who is?\" Snake cocked his brow knowing for sure they were talking bullshit. \"You wife.\" Malloy's voice was finally returning to normal. \"Why'd you ask?\" Snake purred as he tossed the but aside. They were talking shit. \"To confirm the information.\" \"Bullshit.\" Snake took another step back to the curb. His back to the street as he watched the blackbellies approach. \"Are you ready to test that SNAKE?\" Malloy always pleasured himself with the sarcastic tone he used on Plissken's name. Snake had never cared. \"Yeah, I am.\" The Hummer glided up behind him, door open. Plissken disappeared inside before Malloy could blink. The first shot came just as he sped away. Grinning Plissken glanced over at his passenger. \"Cutting it to the wire?\" Taylor laughed. \"Man, when don't you?\" Snake laughed as he pulled out onto the highway. \"What fun would it be if I didn't?\" \"You should have seen his expression when you got in.\" Taylor went on. \"Should've took a picture.\" Snake replied merging into traffic. \"Damn! I knew I forgot something.\" Both the men dissolved into boyish laughter. One more notch for a good escape.

Over and over they came. So many times he'd seen the images flash that he'd lost count what seemed like years ago. Still they came again and he tried to wake from them with every ounce of will. Nothing happened. He tried to sit up but nothing worked. His body refused to respond as he struggled. The scream, high pitched and full of agony flooded his mind like a hurricane. His will cracked to it. The scream went on in blackness before images assaulted him. The flashes were too fast to comprehend but his vivid mind left the impressions for him to decipher as he could. Bloody hair stuck to an already bruising pale face. The flash of a knife pressed to a throat quivering from that unending scream. Tears dripping on the blade from the face he didn't need to see. He knew the voice. Seeing the face would have been too much to endure. The screaming went silent from strain but the throat still trembled with the need for creating sound. The knife moved the blade gleaming in the orange gas filled light and the purple mist. The images were wrong and not the memories. Her face had been covered by a black mask but here in his mind he could see it. Inner torment for his failure was all this was. Even then he couldn't separate this from reality. The vision was on the blade slowly moving to the far side of the neck. He screamed for the voice that had gone dead. He thought he screamed. He tried to scream but like her, his voice was silent even as his lungs strained to push more air. The blade touched opening the skin, sinking farther, deeper. Air hissed and gurgled when the blade was in deep enough to hit the pipes in the throat. Red gore was rushing out around the blade that appeared to have been sinking in to flesh for weeks. Finally it stopped its decent toward the spine and turned to a sideways motion. More flesh split spilling more blood. Oceans of blood seemed to bubble out. The blood was forgotten when tears started to drip from the pale chin into the red mass. She still cried and again his voice shrieked to be heard. She was alive when the blade pulled from gleaming silver to red. Her tears still trickled and breath came from the severed openings for a brief second, an eternity in his mind. The images had just faded when the scream pierced the blackness they had left. Again it was coming on the infinite loop he couldn't break. He struggled to move and break free of the horror. Futility never crossed his mind. Too great was the horror of watching her die over and over. There was no way he could succumb to the images and keep his sanity. If he let go he might never wake. Taylor sat in the chair across the room from Plissken's hospital bed. Nurses and doctors were trying to hold him down as he started to have seizures for the third time this morning. The screaming got to Taylor faster than what he saw. Bill couldn't remember his friend ever screaming let alone one that sounded like the ones now. The seizure passed and they reconnected the IV Plissken had ripped free. As they positioned him on his bed another started, more screaming and the uncovered eye opened even if the doctors still claimed he was in a coma. Taylor didn't think people in a coma screamed like this. Bill looked away watching the monitors. His friend's heartbeat spiked and the blood pressure was up to the point that the beeping started again. They were screaming for that medication Bill could never remember the name of after the screaming stopped but he knew it was to prevent his blood pressure from elevating farther. The screaming subsided but the twitching in Plissken's body never stopped. Taylor wished there was something he could do but there wasn't. There was no life support to pull. Snake was still alive, as alive as any coma patient. The obvious question was what caused the seizures. Test after test came back with no reason for them or the coma he was trapped in. All he could do was wait. Another set of seizures started and the sedatives were administered didn't stop them even if it silenced the screaming. Finally they faded and Snake lay silent and still again. Everyone left the two men alone in the darkened room. Taylor pulled up his crutches and hopped to the bedside chair. Snake's pale skin was cold when he took his hand. Bill just sat there holding his best friend's hand and cried. There was nothing left to do.

Like everyone else he bought into the ploys that it was the Russians or a freak accident that had hit the area just south of Austin. Russia and the Middle East had followed suit bombing major cities. Still Plissken went on fighting in the war believing that the bombing was started overseas. The moment he learned otherwise turned bitter so much of his ideals. That had been five years ago. Two years ago he had learned what really happened. So many still whispered about how good the summit was in Moscow. At least they didn't go nuclear. Snake was really believing that any more it didn't really matter. Invisible radiation or invisible poison, both lead to slow death. The only upside was the gas left buildings standing around empty. Not that they were much good since the gas lingered in them longer than on the streets. It was a mess either way anyone looked at it. Snake stretched out on the couch watching Taylor tend to his leg. He would've helped but Taylor was having another round of independence. Snake could appreciate and understand it. It was something he would do in a similar situation. Rain started on the roof. Plissken heard it and then the air filtration system kicked in. \"Gas in the rain tonight?\" Taylor asked not looking up from his swabbing of the stitches. \"Always is.\" Snake wasn't sure of that but it was better safe than sorry. Just as he settled in listening to the rain the bang came to the door. With a hurried glance at Snake, Taylor hobbled onto his crutches and to the door. Plissken didn't dare go because too many were still looking for him. From where he'd taken up position in the kitchen Snake could hear them talking in low voices but the rain storm was drowning out the details. The door closed giving him the courage to ease out and join Taylor in the other room. \"Man I don't believe this.\" Taylor commented more to himself as he stared wide-eyed at the stack of crisp white papers. \"What?\" Snake came over in a hurry from the curiosity now gnawing at him. \"Taxes.\" \"What?!\" Snake looked over Taylor's shoulder staring in disbelief at the Department of Revenue logo at the top. \"Living tax? What the hell is that?\" Taylor was still stunned. \"I'll tell you what the hell it is.\" Snake grabbed them away. His eye on the paper stack he lit them with his Zippo. Once they'd burned to his fingers he dropped the remaining pieces and stopped on them. \"Fucking garbage.\" Snake marched over to the couch and laid back down listening to the thump of crutches as Taylor started to laugh. Of all the insane things, taxes, taxes on being alive. Someone had lost their mind huffing gas down at the capitol. There was no other explanation.

The tree bark was tough against Plissken's calloused hands, and the chill that lingered in the air helped him keep a clear mind. He hoisted himself onto a thick branch, and waited there silently. While he was far from tired, his heart raced quickly and threatened to strangle him. It was a rush that would be replaced by adrenaline sooner or later, and Plissken only looked forward to its sweet taste. The sigh that passed through his lips was strained and forcibly quiet – a group of blackbellies had trailed him for a while, and now was the perfect time to stop them. Their voices, which were a distant hum, were now clearer, along with footsteps against the grass. Plissken's blue eye focused on a beam of light that swept over the dark tree trunks. His lips were parted, but his breaths were silent. He discovered that it was a small troupe, maybe three or four of them. While it meant less trouble to deal with, Plissken could not help but feel insulted. \"Dammit,\" the voice was a harsh whisper, and heaved tiredly. \"We lost the son of a bitch.\" A blackbelly rested against the tree to catch his breath. What luck. \"I told you we would,\" this voice was quieter. \"We shouldn't've gone off. Hauk'll have us skinned, for sure.\" \"Shut-up, Gagnon. Let's keep a lookout.\" Plissken peered down to see that the rest of the group was farther away. So, they were fresh, young, and stupid hot-shots that had something to prove. That made things easier. He began to tighten his strong legs around the tree branch, and once he was confident, he hung down. All of his weight was pressed against the hard bark as it poked into his skin. The side of his hand swept across the back of the blackbelly's neck. He huffed quietly, and slumped over just as Plissken hauled himself back onto the branch. \"Oh, shit!\" Another beam of light hurriedly shone in every direction, before it settled on his unconscious form. \"Michaud's down!\" The light came closer, a beacon that brought the slow-moving blackbelly with it. Plissken licked his lips before he charged down. He grabbed the other man and swung his elbow into their face, the hit landed above the bridge of the nose. \"You son of a-\" Whoever it was, they grabbed Plissken's arm and tried to grapple with him. His one eye was able to make out the figure in the dark. Swiftly, Plissken crashed his head against theirs. The blackbelly's grip loosened. One more headbutt was able to make him crumple over, unconscious. He backed against the tree for a moment to listen to his surroundings carefully. Only crickets hummed, with no human noises to speak of. After a few moments of stillness, Plissken stepped away from the tree. Another show of hesitance before he took a few more steps. He froze when he heard a deafening click. Nothing to worry about. This guy was probably alone, and it would take a long time for a larger group to arrive. He escaped many situations just like this one. It would not be the last, either. \"That's right, asshole,\" they said. \"Freeze.\" Something was wrong. His one eye widened, just as a flashlight turned on behind him. Two human-shaped shadows were laid on the grass. The voice was painfully familiar. Plissken began to turn around, his arms slowly rose in the air. He jerked back at the strength of the light. Even his covered eye ached for a second. \"I said freeze.\" Their facial features were not obscured by the brightness, although Plissken soon wished that they were. The man's hair was brown and long, but tied back. The color repeated again above his upper lip and within his hard eyes. His face was somewhat round, with full cheeks. An icy cold permeated Plissken's stomach. His heart beat fast, while something within began to strangle his throat. The other man's lips parted as if he recognized the criminal before him. \"Taylor?\" Plissken asked quietly. His voice felt broken. \"Bill?\" For a moment, it looked like he would lower his gun. Sadness glinted in his brown eyes and wallowed with confusion. Taylor's resolve returned as he cocked the gun again. \"How'd you know my name?\" The burning in his eyes ignited. Something within Taylor recognized Plissken intimately, but he could not quite tie the threads together. But the memories flooded through Plissken's mind, all jumbled together. Thoughts of fondness in the Black Light Squadron became a summer day when they were little, crouched around the television watching some old cartoon. The time when he awoke with one damaged eye in a bare hospital room in Taylor's embrace mingled with re-learning depth perception. All paths lead to him slumped on the floor, his blood pouring into the lining and cracks. But there he was, alive and well with a gun in his hand. \"I asked you a damn question!\" Plissken breathed and shook as if he were sobbing. He thought that his tears were long spent, but his vision clouded and the water stung. Taylor already had tears streaming down his cheeks, his face contorted as he tried to keep a cool head. Something within him struggled to connect his feelings to something important. He did not pursue his questions any further. Instead, Taylor reached into his belt and pulled out his radio. He was reluctant to turn it on, but static blared one he flipped the switch. Plissken's eye pleaded with him, but not out of want to escape. \"Remember...?\" It was barely audible, and his voice trailed off. Taylor's gaze was fixed on him. The man hesitated once more before whispering into the radio. \"I..I've got him,\" he said, louder. \"I found Snake Plissken.\" ","Summary":" Based on a discussion with the fabulous Xen/plissken-chan.

He had no idea why they were acting up so much. It was like hell with the four little ones in the hotel room raising hell. Internally he prayed Bria would be back to help soon or he might crack. Between needing to feed the twins and Mason running naked from him while he tried to get a diaper on him Snake almost screamed when the knock came at the door. He couldn't' believe Bria forgot the room key. He had finally got a hold of Mason and carried him naked to the door. Plissken was frazzled, more than frazzled. He was at the end of all patience and just wanted away for a drink. \"You forgot your key.\" Snake growled as he opened the door trying to keep Mason from slipping away. Plissken looked up and froze in shock. It wasn't what he expected to see on the other side of the door. The cop staring back at him seemed just as surprised but more by the baby in his arms than anything else. Both men stood there silently as if working out the situation. Plissken knew he was in no position to run so his mind was working on a plan to fight. There had to be more cops around and he wondered where. The idea of bullets flying around his children turned his stomach. Quick thought was all he could do to play it off. \"I'm busy. Can I help you?\" Snake kept wrestling Mason while he spoke. That was not an act even if his ignorance was. \"Snake Plissken?\" Snake looked up from Mason confused. \"Who?\" \"You're Snake Plissken.\" Snake exaggerated his confusion as much as possible while he stood there. \"I don't know what you're talking about but I got to change my grandson.\" The cop cocked his head before giving Plissken a critical once over that cause the flight desire in Snake almost drove him to breaking point. \"Can I question you?\" The cop took a step forward toward the door. \"I'm busy.\" Snake started to turn away from the door. \"I have to question you.\" The cop insisted. \"If you want to do it while I deal with dirty diapers.\" Snake chuckled a bit and even more when the cop stepped in. Plissken didn't miss a step though his eye was on the cop the whole time. Cassie was laying on the floor coloring and the twins were in the bed when Snake laid mason down on the dresser. The cop was stunned by the scene as Snake expertly put a diaper on the squirming boy. Snake got him dressed and down on the floor before he turned to the cop. \"What can I help you with?\" Snake was playing it cool and facing the cop down. The officer watched him silently, looked at the children and then back at Plissken. \"If there's nothing I got to feed the little ones before they start crying.\" The officer was again quiet then spoke tentatively. \"No, nothing. We're looking for a fugitive.\" Snake did his best to look concerned and not laugh. \"I'll be sure to call the desk if I see anyone suspicious.\" \"Thank you sir.\" The cop spun on his heels and left. Plissken just stared at the closing door. That was too close for comfort. So close he just noticed his palms were sweating.

Too long had passed since he'd hit anything. A few petty crimes here and there were not enough to soothe that inner hatred. There was an easy solution. He'd found a bank that specialized in government accounts. In fact, that was all they did and kept a fairly large sum of cash on hand. It was the perfect small hit to work back into doing jobs. Dressed casually but a little nicer than Plissken normally would he headed into the bank. He had his revolvers but had no intention of using them. That point was reinforced when he saw the armed guard. There would be no brandished firearms unless that idiot pulled first. Despite his desire to fuck over the government left and right, Snake had little desire to kill others. The lines here looked like a nightmare. The shortest had at least ten people in it. In Snake's mind it was too late to turn back now. With a heavy sigh he took his place at the back of the shortest line. It was one of the middle most which Plissken was thankful for. As any bored person did he took his time to look around but he had a purpose, cameras. He spotted the two that covered the back side of the counter and likely through the service area to the person standing at the counter and a second covering the front door. It wasn't much but it was efficient. So was the security system. Snake could trace the wires down under the counter, probably for a panic button or silent alarm. All in all it wouldn't be too bad of a hit. Plissken's eye drifted to the clock, just after one, twenty minutes had passed and the line had crawled up pulling him halfway to his destination. Several more people had come in taking up the waiting game behind him. Snake wasn't much for waiting but when he had a purpose his patience could be never ending. After taking a tally of who had arrived since he last looked over the customers Plissken resumed his wait. He was starting to shift anxiously but then again so was everyone else. Snake caught something as his eye roved the room. The teller in the next window over, a nice looking girl with dark hair and a little too much cleavage for working a bank had a rather odd look in her expression. Snake took in the customer she was working with and then her manners again. The son-of-a-bitch was robbing HIS bank. How dare they take his hit? Plissken saw the gun that the robber had though well concealed from most eyes Plissken knew the score. His first instinct was to flee but anger brewed too hot in his veins. This was his bank and his hit. He pulled from his place in line ducked under the red velvet roping and came up behind the guy like a wildcat and much more likely to kill. The robber must have sensed him coming up and turned. Snake had no mercy for this prick and slugged him full in the jaw. \"This is MY bank you bastard. MINE!\" Snake accented the possessive part with a solid kick to the downed man. Everyone in the place knew something was up by this point. Customers usually did not beat each other in the bank line despite the desire after waiting as long as he had. Snake scanned the crowd and to his surprise saw the guard drawing on him. The first thing he noticed was the fact the gun coming up wasn't a security issued piece. \"Get down\" Snake called out. While he wanted to hit the place the people in line didn't deserve to get shot. People dropped, some were staring, Snake had taken up a gunfighter's stance and was waiting. When the gun leveled out Plissken knew he was the target. With the situation as it was, taking down the robber and the wrong weapon being in the guard's hands, Snake easily deduced the situation. That was the accomplice in the robbery. Clever to say the least but they had chosen the wrong bank for today. Snake drew with the speed of expertise and hit the fake guard high on the hip. Blood splattered on the wall behind. People were screaming now that the boom of a high powered revolver had gone off in such a closed space. Even Plissken's ears were ringing a bit but he was used to ignoring it. Taken aback by the returned fire Snake had time to cross the short distance and unceremoniously ripped the gun from his hand. Plissken was furious that his job had been fucked over by amateurs, no matter how clever they were in positioning their people. He took a handful of the second robber's hair and shoved him to the ground into the puddle of his own blood. The next item on Snake's agenda was to get the fuck out of dodge before the cops showed. Holstering his weapon he saw them already coming up outside the bank. This had gone from an easy job to a nightmare in all of about 30 seconds. Snake rolled his eye and backed away from the door. He quickly switched wallets trading out Snake's for his real one. He had stopped a robbery as disgusted as he was with that proposition. Even so, he had no desire for the cops to identify him and take him to jail. Not today. Not any day really. Plissken kept his hands well away from his guns as the police filtered in. The first question was who had fired the shots. Snake fessed up as there was no escaping that fact. They had him produce his conceal carry permit and the revolver which they asked he unload. Another exchange of identification and he was being instructed to give a statement and fill out papers. He'd rather get shot running away at this point. Plissken's ability to wait in one place had run thin. The addition to a squad of cops in close proximity made it unbearable. Yet he knew the paperwork was the fastest way to get out the door before he got caught. Dutifully he leaned against the door with a clipboard watching the cops drag the two unconscious men out of the bank. His personal information went by in a breeze but the questioning was too much. Plissken cracked a smile at the first question. \"What were you doing at the crime scene before, during and after it was committed?\" Snake couldn't very well write his real reason even if it would be amusing to write \"Scoping the bank out for a robbery.\" He also knew he couldn't write that he was here for an account. He didn't have one with this bank. Taking a moment to think it through Snake had an answer and wrote in a shit story about wanting to open an account here. It would be enough. The other questions were far less amusing aside from one further down near the bottom of the page. \"During the criminal act what were you doing?\" Snake chuckled and wrote in; \"Preventing a bank robbery by assaulting the robbers.\" That done he handed the clipboard back over to the officer who was guarding him. The man perused what Plissken had written before nodding. \"You can go home. If we have any more questions or need more information we will contact you Mr. Plissken.\" The cop smiled at him after he stopped speaking. Snake didn't know what to make of that. Maybe hell had frozen over? The cops were smiling at him and he had stopped the robbery of a government bank. This day was weird to say the least. \"No problem.\" Snake commented and tried to casually walk out despite his desire to run away as fast as he could. Days later the whole thing still seemed surreal. Due to the commotion Plissken was laying low again when there was a knock at his door. Cautiously he glanced out the window to see a postman. Curiosity was the only reaction possible as he walked over and opened the door. \"Are you Steven Plissken?\" Snake nodded. \"I have a certified letter for you. Sign here.\" Plissken didn't know what to make of it but took the machine and pressed his thumb to it for identification. \"Identification confirmed.\" The little machine declared in that all too sexy of a female voice the government seemed to use for all of their voice recordings. Plissken wondered who she was as he took the letter and closed the door. As usual he decided any woman with that nice of a voice was probably some fat hussy or an ugly, manly bitch. Snake sat holding the letter for a moment before pulling it open. There were several sheets of paper inside. The first was a letter. Dear Mr. Plissken, We would like to commend you on your commitment to the security of this nation. Your personal risk to prevent the robbery of…. The letter droned on and on but Plissken gave it a rather uninterested skimming. The second page made his eye wide. It was a check. A reward check for stopping a crime. 10,000 dollars in reward. A solid minute passed before Plissken could react. Snake erupted into laughter. There was no other way to deal with this. He didn't need to rob banks. The government would give him the money for free if he managed to get angry at the right people. Tears streamed down his face from hard laughter before he got up to pour a drink. If they only knew who they paid he was certain Malloy would piss himself. ","Summary":" Plissken had felt like he was getting lazy. Too long had passed since he'd hit anything.

Snake knew hurt was waiting somewhere whether it was walking out to save her or walking out for his wife, worse the things he refused to think but the pain always followed. Too many scars were on him to believe otherwise. Even with his mind in turmoil he leaned up on his elbow to watch her sleep. He was falling for her, falling like a plane crash, maybe he was already at the bottom. Plissken could never tell until it was too late. As he laid there feeling the fear he knew it was too late for him to have a chance. Snake Plissken had things he couldn't escape but none of them involved bars or cuffs, not usually anyway. He made his own prisons with guilt and loss but even those were not as strong as when he was confined by love. Bria grabbed his hand from her hips and pulled it up under her cheek. He wondered if she knew what was happening to him. Snake sighed as his mind wandered back to Xena. He missed her. The ache from her being away never stopped. Part of him wondered if she would understand her being here and the other was occupied with how to hide an affair if she returned. The thoughts brought more unsettling ideas that Plissken pushed away. She shifted again, sleeping restlessly before her head found a place against his chest. Snake smiled down at her. Gently he pushed the hair back from her face. He'd burn for this one way or another. A smile touched his expression. Plissken had always been more of \"a burn out\" type than one to fade away. He knew it. He risked and he survived. He played with fire on both sides and some days he was the master of those flames and others he got burned. Some of the burns never healed, never would. Even then he kept going and tempting his luck to run out. In a life like that, Snake knew how temporary everything was. He knew that most acutely about his life and the small amount of pleasure he pulled from the bleakness. There were options on his plate. He could always walk away. He thought he could but deep inside knew that would never happen again. He could go on as a single father and wait for someday that might never come or he could live. The choice had been an easy one. The choice to live did not change his feelings merely the perspective. Once more Plissken was watching her sleep peacefully. She was a pretty girl, not in the same way as his wife but like her definitely possessed all the things Snake wanted. He'd burn for her. Not many ever got that far under his skin to where he'd risk it all. She was one, his wife was one. This was not an exchange or a substitution.

It caused a stir but his attention was on the squealing boy in front of him on the seat. \"More rides.\" Mason squealed. \"Later. You got to go to school.\" Snake shook his head even as the pout grew. \"But Papaw!\" \"No. I'll be back to pick you up after you go to school.\" Snake kissed his cheek as he pulled off the little helmet. \"We'll even get some ice cream without telling mom.\" \"YAY!\" The boy squealed and wrapped his arms around Snake's neck. \"Let's get inside before you're late.\" Snake picked him up and dismounted the motorcycle. He picked up the small leather backpack. \"Ready?\" \"Are you coming with me Papaw?\" Snake laughed and started walking toward the school. \"I already went to school.\" \"Today?\" The curious eyes were staring up at him in awe. \"Long time ago when I was little like you.\" Mason pouted again as they went inside. \"You'll be fine.\" Plissken looked over the room numbers. He was headed for 111 which he remembered from when he was a kid, 1st grade. Though Mason was here for Preschool in that room. They arrived and Snake got stuck in with the rest of the parents leading children in to meet the teacher. He could kick Evie for making him do this even if he was excited. Glancing around the hall Snake frowned at all the stares. The whispers got to his temper but he held it in sighing to let off the steam. It seemed like it took forever for the stream of parents to think out enough that he could talk to the teacher. She was young, short and looked rather shocked when he appeared in front of her. \"Who is this?\" She addressed Mason and Snake was fine with being ignored. \"Papaw Snake.\" Mason squealed. \"Snake is it?\" She studied him for a long moment with a curious look before sticking her hand out. \"Ellen Thompson.\" He glanced around suspiciously and then down at her hand. Aging had made him more suspicious than ever. Finally he took her hand in a firm grip. \"Snake Plissken and this one Mason.\" \"Grandpas' boy isn't he?' Snake nodded and went to set Mason down by the table that had his name on it in big letters. The moment his feet touched the ground a wail pierced the room so loud that everyone turned to look. \"Mason, munchkin, I can't stay.\" Snake knelt down. \"I'll be back, promise.\" \"NOooooo!\" There was another wail. \"Mason, buddy, Please.\" Snake jumped at the hand on his shoulder before looking up. \"Has he spent time away from the family before?\" It was Mrs. Thompson who had come up behind him. \"No.\" Snake answered pulling Mason back into his arms. \"Why don't you stay today and we'll work on this later?\" \"Stay?\" Snake got wide-eyed at the nod from the teacher. Plissken sighed heavily and pulled out one of the tiny chair. \"Alright.\" The moment he sat down it was like the plague of locusts. All the kids were there poking at him, climbing on him. Snake just rolled his eye. It was like home only there were twice as many here. \"Who would have thought?\" Ellen giggled behind her hand. \"Alright children. Please sit down. Mr. Snake will talk to you all after we finish our work.\" Snake glanced between Ellen and the beaming children. Mason bounced in his lap and Snake knew this was going to be a long day.

The sentiment must have shown clearly in his expression. \"I swear to God, Snake.\" Map to the Stars Edie rambled. Snake could see the fear in his expression. He should have it. The man was inches from having his neck wrung. \"God's dead.\" Snake growled losing the remaining shards of patience in a hurry. \"Well, Buddha or Allah maybe. Who do you believe in? I'll swear to them too.\" Edie would have pissed himself if it was any indication by the sound of his voice. \"Me.\" Snake spit the word out to vent the building fury before he exploded. \"Then I'll swear to you.\" He was just short of begging. The tone only grated further on Snake's nerves. \"How do you know?\" Snake was still suspicious. \"I worked for him, promotions, way back.\" Plissken felt his eye roll before he could even stop it from happening. \"Bullshit.\" Edie stayed silent as Plissken stalked toward him from across the sidewalk and into the street. \"You never did shit for the military.\" Edie took a step back. Plissken smiled like a hungry crocodile. \"I got you by the balls don't I?\" \"I swear Snake.\" His hands came up in relent. Plissken pulled his revolver pointing it to the space between Edie's eyes. \"Done lying?\" He cocked the hammer just to emphasize how serious this draw was. \"Alright, Jeez. I heard Cuervo talking to this guy about it when you were sleeping.\" \"You did knock me out.\" Snake closed the two steps between them in full rage. \"I had to Snake or Cuervo would kill me.\" Snake backed Edie into a lamp post. The predatory gaze pinned him there like a deer. \"Don't you think I will?\" He swore Edie trembled before attempting to weasel away.

He understood how things started not fitting right. She was pregnant after all. He could understand until he heard the thump upstairs. Then another. Curious Snake headed up to the bedroom to check on her. Bria was standing in the middle of the bedroom and by the shoe pinned to the wall he found the source of the thumping. Plissken walked over and pulled the heel out of the wall examined it then looked over at Bria. \"None of my shoes fit.\" She was flustered to the point of being flushed. Snake dropped the shoe and walked over to Bria wrapping his arms around her. She pushed him away and he gave her room. \"Honey?\" \"I don't want to go out. I look like a whale.\" \"A very pretty whale.\" Snake smiled but flinched involuntarily when he saw the look she flashed in his direction. Sighing he tried again and this time she leaned into him. \"Why don't you relax a little?\" Snake brushed her hair back out of her face as she wrapped her arms around his waist and clung. \"You wanted to go out.\" \"We can go later.\" Snake wouldn't let her start blaming herself. She started to protest again and Snake silenced it with a deeply passionate kiss. He pulled back and smiled. \"Why don't you lay on the bed and I'll massage your feet. See about getting the swelling down a little?... hmm?\" Snake cocked a brow at her and put on his most charming if not devious smile. She didn't argue with him and a smile started to appear. Snake was rather fond of taking care of her anyway. Bria walked over to the bed but Snake could see how much her feet and back were hurting. When she sat heavily on the edge of the bed Snake sauntered over and sat Indian style at her feet. He kissed her knee and started working on her ankles. She groaned a bit and lay back propping herself up with a pillow and letting her feet dangle in his lap. It was true he wanted to go out but this was almost as good especially when he considered the view he had straight ahead. Dark red lace should be on that list of sinful things Robertson was so fond of. Plissken leaned up still massaging her foot and started to kiss up Bria's leg. \"Hey! I thought you were massaging?\" Bria sat up a bit and he could tell by her voice she was already feeling much better. \"I am massaging.\" Snake mumbled looking up from where his lips were on her knee. She laughed and poked him in the ribs with her toes. Snake batted it away and bit her knee. \"You bastard.\" She scolded. \"All the time honey.\" He smirked and bit up higher on her leg. \"You're terrible.\" \"And you're gorgeous.\" Snake shot back watching her blush just a little. \"I am not.\" She was arguing like a teenage girl which only made Plissken laugh. \"Good enough to eat.\" He taunted nipping her way up on the thigh and rubbing his scruffy cheek on her inner thigh. It always caused her to squeal. Bria grabbed his shirt and pulled. Snake laughed and climbed up into bed. Going out could go to hell for all he cared.

It was like his home away from home. They were at it again with the reading off his crimes. Snake stared at the ceiling trying not to laugh. Why did they need to read them? He had done the crimes after all so this was a waste of time. He knew what he'd done. Making themselves look good was all this was. Time passed and eventually something caught Snake's attention. He looked down at the officer behind the desk and cocked a brow. \"What?\" There was a brief pause before he watched the pudgy finger trail back up the list. \"Fornication, illegal procurement of sexual services, unauthorized sexual conduct, lewd behavior, possession of pornography, indecent exposure.\" Snake started to laugh which put all the guards on edge. \"This is no laughing matter Plissken.\" Snake stifled the laugh and shook his head. \"Indecent exposure? Must've missed it myself.\" The guard looked confused. \"It says right here that you've committed three acts of indecent exposure.\" Snake remained silent wondering when the hell the cops had caught him naked. His mind sifted through the memories for anything. He had nothing. Maybe they were making things up again? It wouldn't be the first. \"May 12th. Atlantic City New Jersey at Ambrosia.\" The guard look confused. Snake on the other hand knew what they meant now. Stripping. There'd been a cop there when he stripped drunk for the girls. Later on he'd have a laugh over it but for now he shrugged. \"I don't know what you're talking about. Sure it was me?\" He had them going. The officer scratched his head and picked up the phone on the desk. Snake watched quietly wondering what was about to happen. \"We've got a prisoner down here refuting a crime.\" There was a long pause where Plissken could barely make out the chattering sound of whoever was on the other end. \"Indecent exposure.\" The Officer on his end spoke and the voice on the other end spiked. \"Uh-huh.\" A few more moments passed before the phone was hung up. Slowly eyes turned to Plissken as he shifted impatiently. \"You have to file a complaint as well as a suitable alibi for the time of the event. They'll take you to fill them out before we continue processing Mr. Plissken. Have a fine day.\" The pudgy man behind the desk went back to work almost as soon as his voice stopped. Plissken regarded him before a shove got him moving. Down the hall he went and into a room with a tantalizingly large window just above the height of the bushes outside. He sat in the chair while the stack of papers was brought to him. Plissken glanced back over at the window. \"You got a pen?\" Snake smiled politely and one of the guards handed over the pen. Snake went to write emphasizing the difficulty of writing while cuffed. He could. He had before but now he wanted loose. \"Don't think I can do this. Would one of you write for me? These cuffs are making it too hard.\" Innocence was his game but his eye was over toward the window again. No bars. They also didn't have his guns. He'd been caught without them. There was nothing to go back for. Snake watched them deliberate before one stepped forward. To his surprise they took off his cuffs. A beat passed that filled Plissken with immense confusion. \"Thanks.\" He finally said and turned to make good on the papers. Name: Snake looked down at the papers wondering if they would ever really let him off. No matter what he wrote his record was permanent. Nothing was erased. Even his pardon hadn't erased a thing. Smiling to himself Snake put the pen to the paper. Name: Big Dick Plissken Incident Questioned: Three counts: Exposing my God-given weapons. Date of Incident: May 12th, 2001 Location of Incident: Atlantic City Casino Strip area, NJ Actual Activity at Time of Incident: Performing on stage for friends in suitable stage attire. List Details Pertinent to Investigations: Here Snake paused as if thinking as he glanced over at the guards. They were outside the door chatting. Plissken's eye went to the window and he scrutinized it. There wasn't an alarm system to be seen. Snake glanced back at the papers and grinned. List Details Pertinent to Investigations: I just escaped out the window! Snake set the pen down quietly scooting the chair back. They were still looking the other way. Plissken made a run for it. To the window and he had it open in less than a second. As soon as his feet touched the ground he bolted for any direction that was away from the processing center. His heart was pounding causing the pain in his eye to flare hot. It wasn't the debilitating pain that caused him to slow once he cleared the perimeter fence but laughter. Snake couldn't stop laughing when he thought about those idiots picking up that paper and reading it. Nothing could be funnier except for the fact they actually had complaint forms. Plissken slowed to a walk as he started looking for transportation. He was still laughing though he stifled most of it as he waved down a cab to get out of town.

By the time Taylor looked over to see a grin on his buddy's face that was something between mischievous and dirty. \"Alright Snake what you thinking about.\" \"Your sister.\" The grin got wider. \"Come on. I'm serious.\" Taylor assumed he was tormenting him. Nothing new from Plissken. \"So am I.\" Snake answered only seeming half there. \"My sister?\" Taylor was confused. \"Hell Yeah!\" Snake laid back in the grass with the devil's grin still in his expression. \"Why?\" Taylor sat up looking down at Plissken. Something was going on that Taylor knew he probably didn't want to know. \"She's getting hot.\" Snake lifted his brow and sighed. Taylor's expression faded. Given a lifetime he would have never thought that was what he was thinking. \"What?\" Snake looked over at Taylor's expression unsure of what to make of it. \"She's only 16.\" It was the first thing that came to Taylor's mind as he tried to wrap his thoughts around what Snake was saying. \"I know.\" \"AND! She's my sister.\" Taylor wanted to slap some sense into Snake. \"You got a hot sister.\" \"I….\" Taylor gave Snake a kick in the side to which Plissken just laughed. \"I wrote to her.\" Plissken declared. \"I'm taking her out when we get leave next month.\" \"Like hell you are.\" Taylor felt flustered. How could Plissken think like this about his sister? \"Why not?\" Snake sat up to look at Taylor. \"Because… You'll take her off and screw her somewhere.\" Taylor felt ill even saying it. \"Is that a problem?\" Snake couldn't see what the big deal was. There was only a little over three years between them. \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" Snake cocked his head. \"What is she still a virgin or something?\" Taylor's eyes bugged at the comment. \"You are not fucking my sister Snake.\" Snake just laughed as he got up. \"That's her choice now isn't it?\" Taylor just sat there stunned to silence.

Somehow she knew it would come but she tried to ignore it. His hair had changed completely gray a few years earlier but he never slowed much until the past year. Age had finally caught up with him it seemed. Maybe he needed to slow down for once. Still today seemed the worst. He hadn't got up. He didn't even complain. The silence was eerie. Brazen spent most of her time sitting with him but he seemed lost in thought all morning and distant. When he decided to break the silence with his ever roughening voice Susan jumped startled by him. \"I used to hate you.\" He said still staring off. \"Not as much as I hated you.\" She set the book aside and moved to sit beside him on the bed. He just rolled his eye at her. It was good to see his cranky and stand-offish demeanor come back. \"Hmm, must be why you followed me all across the damned country. Some hate you have baby.\" Brazen laughed at his slightly sarcastic comment. \"Cop hater.\" Snake shook his head. Over the years that had become a tease and a joke. \"Not going to smile for me?\" She continued to prod at him. \"Why?\" He cocked his head and looked over from where he was laying. He still seemed distant and far off. \"I love you.\" She whispered and a little bit of a smile, which was a huge smile for Snake, appeared. \"What are you thinking about?\" \"The past.\" Snake shrugged. \"My parents, Taylor, lot of people I lost long time ago.\" Brazen took his hand and gave it a squeeze. \"Do you mean Bill Taylor?\" Snake nodded. \"Think about him a lot lately.\" \"How did the two of you meet?\" Brazen grinned. \"You've still never told me about it.\" \"We were kids when we met. Our fathers served in Vietnam together.\" Snake seemed to brighten up a little more. \"What year was it?\" \"Shit…. 1975 in the late summer.\" Snake shifted and Brazen helped him sit up in bed. It worried her to see him struggling so much. \"His family had moved down from around Helena.\" \"Montana?\" Brazen asked and got an affirmative nod as she rested up against the headboard beside him. \"My parent's had his family over for dinner the day they moved in. His sister was just a baby, two or three. All this stuffy ass bullshit from his mom especially. They tried to get us to sit still in the living room while they cooked. Worked for shit.\" Susan giggled and leaned her head against his shoulder. She could imagine Snake sitting on a couch trying to sit still. She didn't even think he could do it much now. \"Taylor started it. Asked me if there was something better to do. We slipped out the back and took off.\" \"Started early?\" Brazen commented with a knowing smile. Plissken finally laughed. \"You know it baby.\" Snake went on with his story. \"I decided he needed to see this pond down the road. Wasn't far but at that age seemed like miles away. We got there having a fucking great time. Bill'd filled his pockets up with frogs by the time they came looking for us. I knew the look my mom had. I was in deep shit.\" Snake stopped to cough but Susan didn't think much of it when he went back to his story. \"Taylor's mom came up and grabbed him by the collar. He was going to get his ass whipped for something. Running off, the mud, who the hell knows. I saw it though. The frogs were starting to wiggle out. My dad saw it too and started laughing.\" \"That's where you get that from.\" Susan kissed his cheek \"You are just like him.\" \"Always have been. Anyway. She went to swing and crack his ass and this huge fucking frog jumps out and lands right on her bare arm. My dad choked from laughter and all we could do is watch her scream and try to brush it off. She fell right in the fucking water too. Thought I was dead but Taylor was looking at his mom being helped out of the pond like Satan was rolling out of it.\" Snake slipped his arm around her as she slid in closer. \"Did you get out of trouble?\" Susan glanced up at him already knowing he had some way out. \"Hell yeah. My dad and all his laughing. Started telling him he was the reason I was such a terrible boy. My dad looked at her still stifling laughter when she crawled up the bank muddy. Taylor's mom was so indignant about the whole damned thing. My dad stared them down, told them that his boy had safely got their son here and made sure he hadn't drowned should be grateful. Never seen anyone pissed off as Taylor's mom. She told my dad right there that she hated him. Don't think they ever got past tolerating each other after that.\" Brazen was laughing by the time he finished but it stopped when Snake started to cough again. It sounded worse this time. His hand was over his mouth as the coughing fit went on. Brazen helped Plissken sit up and the choking sound subsided. Slowly he took a deep breath but Susan was already in shock at what she saw. A tiny smudge of blood was on his lips. Brazen was afraid of that blood. \"Snake?\" \"I'm alright.\" He waved her off. Susan shook her head and reached out with her thumb to wipe the streak from his lip onto her thumb. \"Blood?\" Snake glanced down at her hand swiftly but it was too late to cover the guilt she saw. \"You knew?\" Brazen accused sounding more hurt and defensive than she planned on. \"You knew and didn't tell me?\" \"Didn't want you worrying about it.\" Plissken had recovered completely from the bout of coughing. Brazen felt the sting of tears. She rarely cried but now there was no choice. \"What's wrong?\" \"I don't know.\" Snake shrugged. \"What do you mean?\" Susan's voice was nearly a shriek from what she felt when he treated this so nonchalantly. \"They don't know. I went to see a doctor.\" Plissken was in no mood to fight and she could see it. \"Those butchers!\" Susan curled against him in the bed. \"What did they say?\" \"Four months, maybe little less.\" Snake seemed resigned to the fate of whatever he had. \"When? When did you go?\" Susan felt like slapping him. It hurt to hear this from him. \"Beginning of April.\" Susan started counting. Tears turned to a flood when the date worked out. \"Last month? You could've died last month! That was two weeks ago.\" \"I know.\" \"When were you going to tell me? When?\" Brazen was frantic and reached out clinging to his shirt. Snake stayed quiet long enough that she sat up looking at him in disbelief. \"Don't argue with me. Not now.\" Snake had a look in his expression that was a plead of some sort. He knew something and she figured he was feeling lot worse that he let on. Susan forced away the tears wiping at the frantically to stop them especially when he started to wipe at them too. \"Stop crying. Keep telling you, makes you look ugly and I don't want no ugly wife.\" Susan giggled through the tears and held tighter to him. He was so much smaller than he once was. Older, frailer but his mind and senses were still there like always. \"Snake, I'm afraid.\" Susan just held him but her mind was out of control with thoughts. \"Of what?\" Snake's voice was quiet and soothing. \"Tomorrow.\" Susan was terrified now. What if tomorrow he was gone? \"What about now?\" Snake made her look up at him as he bit back more coughing. \"Are you afraid of now?\" Susan shook her head because she was unable to speak. \"Then nothing to worry about.\" Snake smiled and started to move over to get up. She couldn't believe he was dying and thinking like this but then that was Plissken. \"What are you doing?\" Susan questioned when she let him go. \"Looks like a nice day. Been sitting on my ass long enough.\" Snake was on his feet beside the bed. \"What do you want to do?\" Brazen followed after him as he stepped into his moccasins. \"Don't know yet.\" Snake smiled when Brazen took his hand. She loved that smile and it never changed. He still looked like he was up to something. \"Why? You want to come with me?\" Plissken asked as if challenging her. Brazen knew he was teasing her. He'd hassled her since the day she met him. \"Depends on what you're doing.\" \"Told you, I don't know.\" Snake growled and it caused him to cough. Susan did her best to ignore the fact he was coughing again. \"Then I don't know either.\" \"You always this damned difficult?\" Snake seemed tired just from standing up too long but the snap in his words was enough to make her smile. \"You married me.\" She teased as he started to walk out of the bedroom. \"Never regretted it.\" Snake smiled a bit at her and left the room. Brazen just watched him for a moment unsure whether to breakdown or smile. He said he loved her often enough but to hear that all the fighting and hate and struggling between them had never made him regret being here was too much. At times she'd regretted it. She regretted being with him. It was rare but she still did at times when things were bad. Susan smiled despite herself and caught up easily with him before he made it to the front door. Susan took his hand and Snake held tight. She wondered how much time they had still for her to forget the regrets she imagined she had. ","Summary":" She never thought she'd be here.

Burning hot pain was all he remembered from being electrocuted by the service box. He'd been stupid though working in the dark was the only way he could go unnoticed on a busy street. He paid for it when two wires touched that never should have. Plissken had a faint recollection of flying through the air and slamming into the ground from the initial jolt. Everything was hazy still but he was well aware of the sticky area on the back of his skull. No wonder his head hurt. He'd busted it open. All he wanted to do was groan but something was constricting his mouth. A second passed before he could force his eye open. Blurs danced in front of his vision but nothing was clear enough to identify. The constriction went away and then came back. Forcing himself through the pounding in his head things cleared. He saw a man over him who was leaning down over him. Then an odd sensation came as he got closer. The first thing to enter his mind was a kiss. Some guy was kissing him while he was unconscious. Plissken lashed out and shoved at the stranger. Panic set in when he saw others around. He was surrounded and injured. Someone else came in and the world went to the proverbial red. Feeling weak and unable to defend himself properly Snake took the offensive and clobbered the approaching person in the face. It was enough to send everyone reeling back away from him. Sliding up to his knees Snake took in the room, which wasn't truly a room but an awning overhanging the street. It was bare and poorly lit just like a holding cell. Things snapped in Plissken's troubled mind that convinced him these were certainly his captors. They had done this, attacked him for attempting a break in. With reality twisting up in the past Snake demanded his body to let him stand. Wavering he eyed the crowd. It moved in when his eye turned away and receded under his gaze. They were looking for an opening to put him back on the ground. Snake would have none of it. The pain still clouded his vision but Snake drew anyway. The gun leveling on the closest person as He felt the pressure of being cornered building to the breaking point. All he wanted was away from his captors. The gun cleared an opening as the gun swayed to-and-fro in his wavering grip. He took the exit stumbling but none tried to catch him when he fell. Hitting the ground fueled the rage to the point that his head started to clear. Those who had been around him fled before his wild look and the blood caked to the left side of his face. It was just as well. Snake holstered his gun before making a rather clumsy run for the nearest alley. He needed to find a place to wall in until the pain cleared enough to make a clear escape from his captors. ","Summary":" Snake had never felt anything like that before.

Many would say they were baser needs and he probably wouldn't argue. After all humans were not glorified beings in Snake's mind. They were always out for themselves and though Plissken wished otherwise even he fell into that category. It was all about me and my needs most days in an endless revolving door to keep everything satiated. One day it was booze, the next women, drugs, rebellion, destruction, good food, sleep, on and on through the cycle of needs. Today though Snake found himself in a dry district. The street was lined in closed down needs; bars, restaurants, whorehouses and on and on down as far as the street extended. In his long walk on the deserted street Snake stopped to regard a fancy building. The stone work looked eerie in the morning light but Plissken was half tempted to break in. Even the library was closed. The building of sin as Robertson said. Knowledge of course was a sinful need when the president was talking bullshit. Too many of the younger generation lacked the ability to be a proficient reader or even write. Snake didn't understand. Plissken could understand plenty even when he didn't agree. Rape he could understand even if he disagreed. The desire for sex was a part of being human. He could understand cannibalism in the same manner. Everyone needed food but some had forgotten where they should be looking. Robertson's decisions however were beyond his comprehension. Why take away everything that kept the people fat and happy? Needs were needs and eventually the desire to have would override the fear of dying to get it. That was the reason for all the underground bars and smoke-easies popping up like roaches throughout most cities. Plissken climbed the stairs to the library. He was no politician but even he could see this was a dumb move. Snake stopped peering into the space between the boards covering the windows. The place was empty inside. Nothing was overturned which meant the Crazies had left this building be. Snake's mind was still looking for logic in Robertson's decisions as he made his way around the side to the door. Even Crazies understood needs. Food was always on their mind but they knew survival. They'd run if too many people had guns. They also understood a fondness for booze which was one of the few reasons Snake didn't dare go into the closed bars until well into the afternoon. They knew their prey had a taste for it even if they didn't. It was knowledge of needs and satisfaction. Plissken still didn't get it as he picked the door lock and the oak door swung open. Snake had a few needs that were hard to satisfy these days. Drugs were easier to come by than they ever had been. Repression breeds need. It happened during prohibition, it was happening now with all manner of desires. Plissken satisfied those wants day in and day out but in a world ruled by a theocracy a good book was hard to come by. Plissken would never deny it. He was interested in things most wouldn't expect; mechanics and science were high on the list but he liked classical literature and several other genres. Snake took in the dusty main floor as he closed and locked the door behind. It had been five years now and from the looks of it this may have been one of the first libraries that were closed. Plissken walked among the desks and shelves looking for something to soothe his intellect. Wandering farther to the back he found a section on aviation. Glancing over the books he quickly chooses a leather bound book titled \"The Complete History of Modern Aviation\". Plissken toted it back to a side room where a leather chair had caught his attention on the way through. Snake hooked his foot through the leg of a child's chair and pulled it over to the big executive looking chair. He left it and moved to open the curtains. Sunlight filtered in as the day was starting. A quick brush down of the chair and Plissken took his seat with feet propped nicely on the little chair. It was pleasantly comfortable and not a bad place to spend the day if not a few. He was tired of walking. Plissken opened the book and went to reading for a short time before he pulled his flask, took a sip and relaxed as he hadn't in years.

That was only compounded by the fact he had woke from his nap in the guest room. Plissken glanced at the clock. It was just after seven. A half hour nap felt like a day long sleep. Bria was there with him and it took a few seconds for the reality to sink back in. Some part of him was still in disbelief. The feeling alone led him to slip out of Bria's arms and the tangle of blankets to go look in the crib. Snake cried when he looked down at the two bundles. The midwife must have took them from the bed after they fell asleep. He didn't often cry but he was happier than he'd been in a long while, since he was married probably. He felt like a fool for crying at the sight of babies but these were his. He was accepting that even with all the work the doctors were doing this was probably the closest he'd ever come to having a child with someone else. There was relief and pain in that realization. The conflicting feeling were brushed away when little eyes opened and looked up at him. Snake didn't know if it was Steven or Mia. They were too new and aside from a diaper check he'd have to guess. Snake reached down and ever so gently picked the awake twin, who he'd later learn was Mia, up. She was adorable and so tiny. Snake was afraid to hold her too tight, afraid if he didn't hold her tightly he'd drop her. Plissken was scared out of his wits but still smiling. Nestling the first in his arm he picked the other up and walked to the rocker he'd made with the huge comfortable cushions. Snake sat there with both of the babies, one in each arm and just held them close to his chest. If he could stay in this moment forever he would. He was peaceful, happy, content and in love. He knew what lay outside of this moment and dreaded its inevitable return. He'd have to be more careful than ever since Bria and the twins wouldn't be mobile for a week if not more. Things were going to have to be perfect, quiet and he'd have to lay low. Still when he looked at the situation he didn't think he'd leave the house much during that time anyway. Bria was watching him when he looked up at the bed. She looked tired but it didn't change the beauty at all when she smiled. Once more he stood with the twins and endured the fear as he went back to the guest bed. As if the babies had a proximity alarm Steven started to cry. It shocked Snake as he sat down in the bed with Bria. He'd heard babies cry before. He'd endured hundreds of them all over the place but this was so much different. The cry of his child sent his adrenaline through the roof in a heartbeat. Mother knew what to do and very comfortably took the crying babe from Plissken. He got comfortable with one baby still in his arms. Bria started nursing the other and snuggled up to his side. He held her, held all three of them close. He nuzzled in Bria's hair feeling more in love with her than he had only this morning. Plissken stayed silent just listening to the sounds with his eye closed. He could hear Bria's sleepy breathing and the even slower content breath of the still sleeping baby. All the sounds were intermittent with the smacking sound of his son nursing. Every one of those sounds were comforting and played to his paternal instinct. He settled in watching Bria with the twins. They traded babies and he was relaxing way too much as the breathing of his family lulled him. The last he could remember was Bria nuzzled against him as they watched the babies sleep. It was a content sleep and a restful sleep that he rarely had. ","Summary":" Snake woke up and things seemed a bit surreal still.

Against all these odds that surrounded him somehow he had made it. These days though he wished he hadn't. Every memory of his past was death. Everything he loved had died. People, in some ways hurt more but were easier to accept. Life was never certain. Everyone died eventually. One day they were there and the next gone. That was life as hard as that was to swallow. Life as always went on. His luck kept him alive even when others died. As much as he hated the deaths around him of people there was something worse. America had died. Not the government or the country but the ideals he had fought for. Once he would give his life for the country. Had that really changed? The country after all was defined by the ideals. The dead ideals. Plissken sighed and looked up at the monitor. It had gone dark like his soul. The images he had played out were still vivid in his mind. Fire curling up on old paper and the smug smile on Robertson's face. Did he really think burning a paper erased what it meant? Plissken began to wonder. So few of the people who remembered life before the war began were alive or free. Maybe it would pass into memory. Plissken hated to think of it. Reaching out he clicked the monitor off and sat back in the quiet dark. The America he had grown up in shared the same place in his mind as the friends he'd lost. It fueled the burning coal fire of hate that filled him to explosion. Pressure, pain, hate, all stewing together at the boiling point. The broadcast he'd just watched pushed him somewhere past explosion. Where he was now? He wasn't sure. He learned now there was a place beyond his hate. Cold, dark and deadly all he wanted to do was kill. Not randomly. No, there was a list rolling through his mind set to perfect pictures. His mind worked in math and crystal clear images. Most of the strongest imagery had been put there by the people on the list. The killers of everything he had a relationship with, even his country. Snake had not forgotten what was on that paper he watched go up in flames. In elementary school he'd memorized it. Now the words echoed in his head and down into the hollow of his soul where parts of him had been stripped away by death. The country was so far from those words now. There was no more \"We the people…\". Freedom was dead in America. America itself was dead. Plissken's eye had become riveted on the dark screen. Moments past before he bolted up to his feet from the worn lounge chair. Something had to be done. It couldn't wait. Plissken couldn't wait. Grabbing his coat he checked his guns and headed for the streets. Someone had to pay for this death like people had for all the others. Snake could turn a blind eye to a lot of things; burning the original Constitution on a nationwide broadcast was not one of them. ","Summary":" Snake had survived.

The blood dripping down his arm was only slightly less annoying than they were but he knew they smelled the blood. Blood made them itch to kill. They shifted around him before tightening the grips on their rifles. Plissken knew at any second one crazy finger could twitch and he'd take another bullet. Only with these bastards it would be an emptying of all the magazines. For a moment his mind flashed back to Taylor. His mangled arm sliding gore on the Hummer station floor. The same tension had been in the blackbellies then. That deep frown returned to Plissken's expression though he was ignoring the group that had him surrounded. \"Thought you could run forever Plissken?\" Snake glanced up slowly to see a faceless black shield that was addressing him. The cowards almost never let him see who they were. Probably afraid of his retribution was all Plissken could think. Shifting anxiously in the circle a rifle muzzle shoved him as a reminder to stay still. \"Now you're trapped.\" Snake glanced over his shoulder and around the circle. He barely contained the cynical laugh. \"Thanks for pointing out the obvious.\" \"This isn't funny Plissken. You're wanted for…..\" Snake cut him off. \"Snake.\" The word came cool and smooth as serpent skin with nearly the same deadly intent. \"What did you say?\" \"Call me Snake.\" Plissken watched the empty face shield. In his mind he imagined that maybe staring at the mirrored surface long enough would reveal the man behind it. \"Shut him up.\" Snake knew that command. It was like telling a dog to get someone. His eye couldn't scan fast enough to catch the blow. The world went white-hot orange when the rifle butt crashed into the back of his head. Plissken went down but caught himself before completely smashing into the concrete. Things went black briefly but the pain ripping through his bad eye wouldn't even give him the relief of unconsciousness. \"Get up.\" Plissken didn't want to. A hard steel-toed kick to the side sent him into more legs that booted him back to the center. That was enough to get him up no matter how much his head throbbed with fiery pain. Pulling himself up he once more faced his reflection in the helmet visor. There was blood on his neck. He assumed they hit him harder than he thought. One more concussion was worth little more than a disgusted groan. Momentarily, Snake contemplated on the origin of the groan once his hearing settled back on the speaker. The list of crimes and entanglements was as groan worthy as the pain. More came as Snake watched the blackbellies itching for his blood. Still there was always a way out. Plissken knew it even if he couldn't deduce the course of action with the pain behind his eye forcing a blinding migraine into his brain. Other thoughts that he didn't want seemed to abound. As he stood ignoring how near death he was, Plissken could only think of the black visors. Crazies were light sensitive. With the rumors that gas crazy veterans were used in the police force Plissken could only come with one answer. He shivered involuntarily. Nothing unnerved and terrified him like the Crazies. The idea of putting an automatic weapon in their hands was something beyond the conceivable limits of horror. \"Plissken. Are you listening?\" He looked back up at the visor obscured cop curiously. He hadn't been paying attention at all this time. Plissken blamed it on the feeling of impending death on someone's account. \"Aren't you afraid?\" Snake's head instantly cocked in curiosity. That had to be the oddest question he'd been asked. \"Of what?\" The words were cool and calm despite his frantic search for any possible escape. \"The order to shoot?\" The blackbellies all about jumped at those words. Snake braced himself for the pain but no triggers pulled. \"You're going to die.\" \"We all do.\" Plissken replied revealing just how disinterested he was in this conversation. Another rifle butt came down between his shoulder blades from behind. His wind let go but he started moving. Gasping he fought down the pain that took his breath away. The hallways in all the new buildings went on forever in long straight corridors. That too had Plissken's attention. His curiosity forced him to wonder why. Guards stepped from in front of him just in time for Plissken to catch the last movement of a Hummer station elevator opening. Another blow shoved him inside with three guards packed in around him. Snake hated being crushed so close to the filth and stink of the police. Doors closed and the elevator lurched into motion. In a blur Plissken's mind was made up. The first to gain his wrath stood before him. Blood on the rifle butt meant one thing. Snake showed no mercy when his hands flashed out wrenching the blackbelly's neck to a snap before the other two could move. He buried his toe spikes into the shins of the next. His companion aimed in the close quarters but missed and shot his buddy much to Plissken's delight. The obsession with silencing areas that made up the station was a godsend. Not a soul heard the shots fired as Plissken wrestled for the remaining gun. When the reluctance to hand over the weapons was obvious so Plissken went to plan B. In one swift collision of forehead to nose the final guard slumped. Paranoia was running high as the lighted numbers rolled on. The climb to the surface seemed agonizingly slow. He could swear as he stepped out into the brilliant sun of the Colorado desert that he was about to be caught. Snake inched into the sunlight. Nothing. No one. The place was empty. Not a blackbelly to be seen. Snake took a handgun from the guard, shooting out the elevator box and the controls before bolting. Snake ran toward the Rocky Mountain foothills. It was more than a day's run but with heat on his ass Snake figured that would be half the time. ","Summary":" Snake glanced at the humming circle of blackbellies.

This was nothing usual especially when he dared to enter Lynchburg. Today it was a necessary evil and as expected he ended up running with a police chopper on his ass. Same old same old. An open window half way up the street on the dark side looked promising. Snake ducked into the darkness cast by the buildings and pushed his tired body to the limits. He had to if he wanted any hopes of out running the chopper and its searchlights. Plissken got below the window, jumped up and hoisted himself in the window. The inside was pitch black. He lowered himself to the floor and held tight while he waited for his eye to adjust. The bright beam of light and wave of noise came from outside the window. Involuntarily he held his breath until it started to fade. He was safe for now. Snake observed the room noting it was a bathroom. Probably the women's room when he noticed the lack of urinals. He didn't much care and now that his breath was coming back he had to piss. Snake walked nonchalantly to the stall and was just about to open his pants when the lights came on. Plissken froze and turned in the stall. Five or six sets of quiet foot steps were headed for his position. There was no way the cops had caught up with him already. Snake tensed as the shadows crawled closer. He could see five and waited in silence in case he needed to strike. Noise in the next stall over distracted him but the shriek brought his full attention back to the open door of his stall. \"Jesus Christ.\" Snake couldn't hold in the shock as he stared at a relatively young nun who was shrieking like she saw a ghost. Snake started to move foreword and got not a step beyond the door before a hard crack to the arm caught him by surprise. A red welt was already rising on the skin when his eye turned to it. \"What are you doing in here?\" The woman beside him, much older, was waving a thick wooden ruler like a deadly weapon. \"And don't use that curse again.\" Snake was so taken aback by the older woman that he took a step away. \"Damn.\" Another crack came as Snake tried to ward it off. \"Fuck.\" The sting had brought out another curse and a strike in response. This time Plissken bit down on the words. Holding in the curses as his head throbbed from being cracked with a ruler was near impossible. \"Someone call the police.\" Snake all but panicked. \"No, don't.\" \"Why not?\" The slightly out of breath elderly woman pinned him with an expression that would have made the Ruskie interrogators run for the hills. \"I was leaving.\" Snake declared as he eyed the ruler warily. \"Through the bathroom?\" God she sounded like his mother. \"No.\" Snake moved to leave and she came between him and his way out. Normally he would have pushed past but even Snake wouldn't shove an elderly nun aside. Something about it just seemed wrong. \"Why did I find you in the girl's room?\" She was determined. \"And don't lie.\" \"Would you rather I pissed on the floor?\" Snake rolled his eye and managed to dodge the ruler this time. \"You have quite a foul mouth on you but it complements your reek of drink.\" The woman was a viper and surly as a rhino. Snake sighed and looked around the room. \"Can I go now?\" \"Are you going to flush before you leave?\" Snake glanced into the stall and frowned. \"I didn't use it.\" \"Well, go ahead. You broke in to use it.\" Plissken rolled his eye and turned toward the stall with the older nun right on his heels. He paused at the stall door and looked over his shoulder at her. \"What you going to watch?\" \"No. I'm going to make sure you don't slip off into the convent. I know your kind.\" She was waving the ruler again. \"Really?\" Snake questioned as he closed the door. There was no way he could piss with nuns outside the door listening. \"You are all sinful rogues who need reprimanded for your actions.\" Snake listened to her go on about how terrible he was while trying to concentrate on pissing. It wasn't working, not until he cleared his mind. Finished, he flushed and redid his pants before walking out of the stall. The older nun was standing by the far door he assumed was the exit to the rest of the building. Snake made for it like hell was coming. The welt on his arm burned like fire. \"You get over there and wash your hands.\" Snake froze and stared at her when he tried to walk past. She was like his mother and the voice culled him to a compliant kid. Reluctant but dutifully Plissken walked over and washed his hands. He wiped the wet hands on his pants and heard the telltale motherly sigh. \"Can I go now?\" He asked. She nodded. \"Down the hall to the end and head to the left. The door in at the far end.\" Snake nodded as he stepped from the bathroom and into the corridor. \"In the future, Mr. Plissken, do try to use the front door for our bathrooms instead of the window. You frightened my poor girls.\" Snake turned to give her a queer look. She smiled much like a mother looking after her boy after he'd been to detention. Snake knew the look enough that he laughed quietly. So much like his mother aside from the ruler. Plissken rubbed his arm and stepped into the night air to find a place to lay low.

Bueno, ésta es la primera historia que subo, espero que a alguien le guste :) Aquí va... Capítulo 1: El Bosque. —¡Hansel! ¡Hansel, no me dejes! ¡Por favor, no me abandones! ¡No hagas lo mismo que hicieron nuestros padres! Hansel… —ya no tenía voz para seguir gritando. Me detuve, afirmándome de un árbol, respirando con dificultad. Llevaba horas buscándolo, sin poder dar con él. Comenzaba a sentirme muy cansada. Era un bosque gigantesco, oscuro y tenebroso. Me dejé caer al suelo. Necesitaba a Hansel, aquí, conmigo, pero no sabía dónde estaba y comenzaba a creer que me había abandonado... \"Gretel\". —¿Hansel, eres tú? —no podía ver nada a través del bosque debido a la oscuridad de la noche, sin embargo estaba segura de haber oído su voz. \"Gretel, ¿puedes oírme?\". —¡Hansel! ¡¿Dónde estás?! —grité lo más fuerte que pude. No obtuve respuesta y todo volvió a permanecer en silencio. No sabía qué hacer. Estaba apoyada en un árbol, descansando, cuando un gran ruido me asustó y me hizo levantar. Miré en la dirección en que se escuchaba. Eran árboles, cayendo uno tras otro en una especie de agujero que cada vez adquiría mayores proporciones en el suelo, expandiéndose y acercándose al lugar en el que me encontraba. Sin pensarlo dos veces me levanté, tomé mis armas y comencé a correr, ahora era mi vida la que estaba en juego. No supe de dónde saqué nueva energía para hacerlo, fue como una especie de descarga eléctrica, incluso llegué a sentir que me quemaba. \"Gretel, resiste\". —¡Hansel! —grité nuevamente. Todo el tiempo que se suponía que había estado corriendo, no había servido de nada. Seguía en el mismo lugar pero el agujero cada vez estaba más cerca. Estaba transpirando, sentía mis armas más pesadas de lo normal y mi cuerpo más pesado que antes. Ya no podía seguir, así que me detuve. Cerré mis ojos, resignada a caer dentro de él. Pasaron los segundos y nada ocurrió. No caí, seguía donde estaba. Los volví a abrir y para mi sorpresa vi que al detenerme, el agujero también lo había hecho. Me quedé quieta y nada pasó. Me acerqué para mirar qué había dentro de él. Había una escalera de madera en una de las paredes, aunque no se veía hasta donde llegaba, ni qué tan profundo era el agujero. Pero si llegaba al fondo, quizás, podría encontrar a Hansel, sólo quizás, él podría estar allí. Decidí bajar. Algo me decía que él estaba allí...[Chapter 2] Comencé a descender con la mayor precaución posible, no deseaba caer de quién sabía cuánta altura. Todo marchaba bien hasta que una de las maderas cedió al no resistir mi peso y caí directamente al fondo. —¡Ahhh! —gemí. Jamás había sentido un dolor así, fue terrible, fue como si me partieran en muchos pedazos y éstos fueran arrojados al fuego… así se debieron de sentir las malditas brujas que habíamos quemado. Fue tanto el dolor que me dejó inconsciente. Al despertar no tenía idea de cuánto tiempo había pasado, pero curiosamente me sentía bien, bueno, bien dentro de lo que se puede esperar. Me levanté, busqué mis armas a mí alrededor tanteando con las manos, porque no veía nada, estaba totalmente oscuro, pero éstas no estaban. Recordaba haber caído con ellas. ¿Qué podía hacer? No recordaba por dónde se suponía que había bajado, si caminaba, corría el riesgo de caer a otro agujero o doblarme un pie o cualquier cosa mala, porque definitivamente la suerte no estaba de mi parte, así que preferí quedarme donde estaba, me senté y nuevamente comencé a llamar a mi hermano. —¡Hansel! Genial, me dejaban sola en medio del bosque, se suponía que éramos un equipo, ¿dónde estaban los demás? No respondía ni Hansel ni Ben ni Edward. Sabía que podía defenderme pero aún así un poco de ayuda nunca estaba demás. —¡¿Dónde están?! ¡Hans...! De pronto se prendieron sucesivamente varias velas, iluminando todo a su paso. Me levanté de un salto. Estaban colocadas de tal forma que hacían un camino que llevaba a una cabaña lejana. Sin dudarlo me dirigí hacia ella, pero a medida que avanzaba, fui disminuyendo el paso... ¿Qué hacía una cabaña en medio de un agujero que se movía? Decidí volver, buscar mis armas y regresar a investigar esa misteriosa cabaña. Al cabo de un tiempo volví, preparada para averiguar lo que estaba en su interior. Caminaba con precaución y a medida que me acercaba, me parecía más familiar... ¡No! No podía ser… Antes no me había fijado en su fachada, pero ahora sí. Su parte frontal parecía estar hecha de diversos materiales. El techo estaba cubierto por una sustancia blanca que caía por las paredes y estás eran de un color oscuro, no pudiéndose identificar nada más que una especie de círculo que hacía de puerta. Estaba bastante destruida por el paso de los años. Otra vez volvía al lugar donde todo había comenzado, donde habíamos quemado a la estúpida bruja que nos había querido matar cuando sólo éramos unos niños indefensos... Al final la que había resultado muerta había sido ella y en nuestras manos. También fue el último lugar que vio Muriel antes de dejar de existir. Abrí la puerta de una patada, mientras apuntaba mi arma con firmeza hacia el interior. Una vez dentro miré en todas las direcciones y nada se movía. Bajé mis flechas. Estaba todo igual que la última vez, recorrí con mis dedos los muebles sucios, sí, estaba abandonada, no había señales de vida. Tenía que quedarme allí, quizás los demás pasaran cerca del agujero y se acercaran a mirar. Como no podía hacer nada más que esperar, me recosté en piso. Me dormí al instante… Calor, mucho calor, fue lo que me despertó. Me senté y vi que la cabaña estaba ardiendo, había fuego por todas partes. No podía respirar bien… \"Gretel\". —Hansel… —dije antes de comenzar a toser. Me ardía la garganta, me picaban los ojos y me costaba respirar—. Hansel… ¿dónde estás? —ni siquiera veía la puerta, no recordaba haber entrado tanto, mi cuerpo ardía. Pensé que me estaba quemando, pero no tenía fuego en la ropa, algo extraño ya que había una gran parte de la cabaña incendiada. \"Gretel, resiste, mejorarás\". ¿Mejoraré? ¿De qué estaba hablando mi hermano? No tenía mejora, iba a morir quemada, ya no me podía mover y él en vez de venir a ayudarme me decía que, ¿mejoraría? ¿Se había vuelto loco o qué? \"Gretel, respira\". Ya no me podía sostener, ni podía pensar con claridad, lo último que pasó por mi mente fue que Hansel se había convertido en un ángel y que desde el más allá me mandaba fuerzas… fuerzas inútiles porque un mar de oscuridad me absorbió por completo... A las lindas personitas que comentaron, muchas gracias :D De verdad se agradece mucho :)[Chapter 3] Desperté por una luz brillante que me llegaba directo a los ojos, molestándome. Era el sol. Traté de sentarme pero sentí un terrible dolor de cabeza, ocasionando que me volviera a acostar. Dejé pasar unos minutos y lentamente me senté. Miré a mi alrededor. Ya no estaba en la cabaña que había estado quemándose. Estaba en un bosque, rodeada de pasto, árboles y flores. No sabía específicamente qué lugar era ni cómo había llegado allí. Quizás alguien había visto la cabaña quemándose y había entrado para averiguar si había alguien, entonces me había encontrado y me había rescatado. Era algo improbable pero no encontraba otra explicación. Me di cuenta que estaba en una especie de colchón, tapada con unas mantas, sobre un pasto que se extendía en todas direcciones. A mi lado había una fuente con agua, unos paños y algunas hierbas. Cerca de donde estaba, había tres puestos más, con ropas de distintos tamaños y estilos, todo estaba algo desordenado pero se podía apreciar que antes habían estado durmiendo allí personas, bueno, en al menos dos de ellos, porque el tercero era bastante grande. Esas cosas me parecieron bastante familiar. Si no fuera porque había escuchado a Hansel en mi cabeza antes que quedar completamente inconsciente en la cabaña, diría que pertenecían a mi hermano, a Ben y a Edward. Pero como no se veían por ninguna parte, no sabía qué pensar. Estaba tratando de levantarme cuando oí un rugido a lo lejos. Miré hacia el lugar del cual me pareció que provenía ese ruido y vi a Edward, que se acercaba. Al instante una sonrisa se dibujo en mis labios. Esperé a que llegara a mi lado y lo abracé. Realmente me alegraba de verlo. El también estaba feliz, me devolvió el abrazo, apretándome demasiado y provocando dolor en mi cuerpo. —Edward, ya estoy aquí —le dije para tranquilizarlo—. Yo también me alegro de verte, pero por favor, suéltame. —Gretel —gruñó como respuesta mientras aflojaba su abrazo pero sin llegar a soltarme. —¡Oye gigante! Ya suéltala —dijo una voz que aparecía por atrás de Edward. Era Hansel. Cuando quedé libre, se acercó a mí y también me abrazó. —Me alegra que ya estés mejor, nos tenías muy preocupados. —Así es, Hansel no dormía cuidándote —intervino Ben, que llegaba a nuestro lado, cargando baldes que contenían agua. ¿Qué? ¿De qué estaban hablando? No entendía nada, cuidándome de qué. Me separé de mi hermano. —¿De qué hablan? —les pregunté para poder aclarar un poco mi mente porque estaba bastante confundida. —Estuviste una semana en cama —respondió Hansel, mirándome como si me hubiera vuelto loca. —¿Qué? No, ustedes se fueron y me dejaron sola —dije a modo de regaño, mirándolos a los tres. —Jamás nos hemos ido, hemos estado aquí contigo —contestó Ben, extrañado por mi acusación. Ahora sí que me había perdido, no comprendía qué me estaban diciendo. —No, yo estaba en esa maldita casa hecha de dulce… —no pude continuar porque Hansel me interrumpió. —Gretel, ya no sabes lo que dices. Has estado una semana con fiebre. No despertabas pero hablabas muchas incoherencias, yo estaba a tu lado. Nos traicionaron en el último pueblo que estuvimos y a ti te infectaron. Una anciana nos ayudó a salir y nos quedamos aquí hasta que te pusieras mejor para poder continuar. Lo miré incrédula. Recordaba que después de haber matado a esa bruja en el desierto habíamos llegado a otro pueblo y ahí, nos habían dicho que había dos o tres que estaban causando un gran daño. Nos habíamos quedado en una cabaña en la cual nos habían atendido muy bien, nos daban buena comida y buena atención, fue por unos días mientras nos preparábamos para atacar. El día en que habíamos partido a cazar esas brujas, una mujer me dio una cantimplora. Recuerdo que iba caminando cuando bebí su contenido. Luego desperté en el bosque. Como si Hansel hubiera leído mis pensamientos, continuó: —Luego de que bebieras el contenido de esa cantimplora, te desmayaste y no reaccionabas. En ese momento apareció una anciana y nos dijo que nos dirigíamos a una trampa, que no eran una ni dos brujas, sino mucha más. Ella nos ayudó, te cuidó, te dio de beber diferentes hierbas y tés. Luego nos dijo que teníamos que abandonar lo más rápido que pudiéramos ese pueblo porque ahí no estamos seguros, que tuviéramos cuidado, las pocas brujas que habían sobrevivido al Sabbat en Augsburgo, se habían estado organizando para tendernos una trampa y que además habían esparcido la noticia de que tú eras una bruja blanca. Así que tenemos que tener cuidado en quiénes confiamos o mejor dicho, no confiemos en nadie. No podía creer todo lo que me había dicho. ¿Tantas noticias me había perdido mientras estaba con fiebre? —Bueno, ya estoy de regreso para que exterminemos a todas esas brujas —le respondí con una sonrisa. —Esta vez no será fácil, tenemos que prepararnos, ya no tenemos el factor sorpresa —dijo Hansel, seriamente. Tenía razón pero de todas formas estaba feliz porque había regresado junto a mi hermano y mis amigos. Ellos nunca me habían abandonado, al contrario, me habían cuidado mientras tenía fiebre. Todo había sido un sueño y ahora teníamos que enfocarnos en cazar a esas brujas que habían logrado sobrevivir en Augsburgo… Hola, bueno, sé que quizás ya nadie siga esta historia, pero quiero aclarar que aunque me demore en actualizar no la dejaré sin terminar.

No importaba que tan mal hubiera tratado a Edith, el seguía extrañando a su hermana mayor que lo protegía de los castigos de su padre y de su madre y lo cuidaba de los sonidos que habitaban en la casa. \"Perdón por hacerte esperar, querida\" De lo que sí se había acostumbrado a hacer era a tomar a Edith por la cintura en un abrazo \"No quise asustarte\" Edith se volteó devolviéndole el abrazo \"No importa – recostó su cabeza en su pecho – mientras te encuentres bien puedes asustarme lo que quieras\" Salieron de la mansión Cushing hacía el edificio del padre de Edith ; el mismo edificio dónde se habían conocido, dónde Thomas había decidido que Edith era mejor que alguien que solo se fijaba en el dinero y en la apariencia, eso era lo que le había gustado a Thomas de Edith, ella no se fijaba en su título; lo que de verdad era algo maravilloso de ella era su forma de ver el mundo, de verlo a él; una manera de la que se aferró para cambiar y ser todo lo que pensaba que no podía ser. Sin duda eso era algo que la tal Eunice no podía ver en él ni en nadie. Thomas pensaba eso cada vez que se acercaba a ese edificio, avanzaba con Edith a su lado, algo que lo reconfortaba, Edith había reiniciado su historia ya que Lucille había quemado la anterior y se la iba a entregar a Ogilvie; su segundo intento para publicar su historia ya rechazada. \"Por favor pasen\" un hombre les indíco la entrada a una oficina, sin embargo Thomas se quedó quieto \"Thomas, ¿Qué pasa?\" \"Lo- lo siento, es sólo que- pasó su mano por su cabello – creo que prefiero esperarte aquí\" \"Está bien, estaré de vuelta en un momento\" con eso Edith se alejó de Thomas dando media vuelta y entrando a la oficina de Ogilvie, unos minutos después el entró para atender a Edith. Thomas se quedó parado unos instantes mirando a la puerta, extrañando a Edith pero se obligó a sí mismo a cumplir con lo que le había dicho a Edith (no muy seguro de porque) y distraerse con cualquier cosa. \"Entonces, ¿lo publicará?\" Thomas llevaba a Edith del brazo mientras se abrían paso por una calle llena de gente. \"No estoy muy segura, apenas terminó los primeros 3 capítulos me miró y me dijo que tenía muchas cosas que hacer y que hablaría conmigo después\" Thomas podía ver la preocupación en los ojos de Edith, algo que no había visto desde que se habían mudado a la mansión Cushing. \"No te preocupes – le dijo dándole un choque amistoso con su hombro –ya recapacitará\" Edith le devolvió el choque con una sonrisa débil \"Además, aún no te ha dicho que no lo cual quiere decir que se lo está pensando\" \"Gracias Thomas, creo que tienes razón no tengo porque preocuparme por eso\" Thomas se sintió aliviado después de escuchar eso de la boca de su esposa y con esto, siguieron su camino de regreso a la mansión Cushing.[Chapter 2] (N/A) Si, como ya había dicho es mi primer fanfic (0 visitas TT_TT) creo que Edith es un poco \"no Edith\" pero no importa después de todo es fanfiction, ¿No? Bueno seguiré con la esperanza de que alguien lea esto… *Edith* Thomas estaba otra vez en el baño y como siempre se estaba tardando mucho, desde que Lucille había muerto algo en Thomas había cambiado para bien claro; pero también había algo raro en él, era más callado de lo normal y cada vez que alguien se atrevía a mencionar algo acerca de su hermana o de la mansión de los Sharpe parecía que algo en él se apagaba. Parecía como si una parte del Thomas del que se había enamorado hubiera desaparecido; una parte del Thomas al que le gustaba soñar con su máquina y una vida en la que el dinero no era un problema se había ido y Edith no estaba muy segura de volver a ver esa parte. \"¿Thomas?\" se acercó a la puerta con el abrigo colgando del brazo. \"Salgo en un segundo-\"Edith se dio permiso para interrumpir a Thomas. \"No, no te apresures por mí; voy a salir y volveré en unas horas\" de la nada la puerta del baño se abrió y salió Thomas ya vestido, con el pelo mojado y una toalla en el brazo. \"¿No quieres que te acompañe? Salió del baño para tomar sus zapatos pero Edith lo detuvo tomándolo por el brazo. \"No, no creo que sea necesario además no tardaré mucho\" Thomas se acercó más a ella hasta que sus cuerpos se estaban rozando, Edith podía ver sus ojos azules escaneando su cara. Thomas le dio un beso de despedida, podía ver el cariño en sus ojos, eso la hacía querer quedarse pero se obligó a seguir su camino. Salió en camino al consultorio de Alan, su amigo de la infancia con la hermana molesta que la avergonzó por lo que vio después de la muerte de su madre. Se dio cuenta de lo que estaba pensando y se incorporó un poco, avanzando hacia el edificio dónde se encontraba el consultorio, mientras avanzaba recordó cómo le advirtió acerca de los Sharpe y la preocupación en los ojos mientras le explicaba que los hermanos no parecían muy confiables. Cuando cruzó la puerta se encontró con Alan revisando al mismo paciente que había atendido el día que vieron las imágenes con fantasmas en ellas. \"Necesito que lleve este medicamento a la farmacia y le pida a los doctores que la preparen como dicen las indicaciones\" Edith sintió un escalofrío recorrer su cuerpo al darse cuenta que eso había sido lo mismo que la había dicho a ese hombre el día de las fotos. Recorrió la estantería esta vez llena con documentos. Nada. Los libros que había visto de detectives habían desaparecido y lo único que había eran documentos y libros acerca de su profesión. El hombre salió del consultorio y Alan se acercó a recibirla. \"Hola Edith, es lindo volverte a ver\" Edith dio la vuelta para encontrarse con un cálido abrazo. \"Es lindo verte también\" Alan se alejó de Edith manteniendo la mirada firme en sus ojos. \"¿Y qué te trae por aquí?\" \"¿No puedo visitarte después de lo que hiciste por mí?\" Edith recordó como Alan había sido apuñalado y el miedo que sintió cuando lo encontró con los ojos cerrados en el sótano. \"No, no quise decir eso – bajó la mirada con nerviosismo para volver a subirla y continuar- es solo que… no esperaba verte por aquí\" Edith sintió remordimiento por haberlo hecho sentir así pero se atrevió a continuar hablando. \"Vine para ver cómo te encuentras\". Notó cómo Alan se sonrojó al escuchar eso, luego recordó lo que su padre dijo \"El joven Alan siempre ha tenido una gran afición a ti\" se sintió un poco deprimida al imaginarse cómo se habría sentido cuando se enteró de que se iba a comprometer con Thomas. \"Pues gracias por eso, Edith\" era un poco extraño que pronunciara tanto su nombre pero le agradaba al mismo tiempo \"Pero no creo que debas preocuparte por mí; después de todo ahora estás casada y tienes otras cosas en que pensar\" Edith sintió una punzada en el pecho al escuchar eso. \"Alan, no-\" \"Edith, no tienes de que preocuparte voy a estar bien\" tomó a Edith por los brazos y la guío hasta la entrada \"Te prometo que voy a estar bien\" Edith salió a regañadientes guiada por Alan. Mientras salía del edificio suspiro y siguió avanzando pensando en el daño que había hecho. *Alan* En cuánto despidió a Edith, Alan cerró la puerta y se sentó frente a su escritorio llevándose el dedo índice y pulgar a las sienes, pensando en Edith y en su nueva vida (reiniciada por tercera vez) y en cómo nunca se atrevió a revelar sus sentimientos hacia ella. Pasaron unos minutos hasta que alguien llamó a la puerta; Alan se levantó de la silla y se dirigió a abrirla, en cuánto agarró el pómulo de la puerta escucho la voz de su madre y de su hermana. Alan se sintió un poco decepcionado al escuchar eso ya que esperaba que Edith hubiera regresado. Entreabrió la puerta cómo queriendo que se percataran de que deseaba estar solo pero al parecer su madre y su hermana pensaban algo distinto para él. \"¡Alan!, ¿Estas prestando atención?\" Su madre chasqueó los dedos frente a su cara para atraer su atención, sacándolo de la profundidad de su mente. \"¡S-sí, lo lamento!\" Su madre se acercó a él examinando su cara lentamente, parecía que por primera vez se fijaba de verdad en su hijo mayor; cómo sí por primera vez se diera cuenta de que pensaba por sí mismo. \"¿Sucede algo, madre?\" Su madre se alejó rápidamente, cómo si algo en él la hubiera asustado. \"No, lo lamento es sólo que – recuperó la compostura – pensé que no nos estabas poniendo atención\". Alan se percató de que su hermana no había dicho una sola palabra así que se levantó y la tomó por el brazo, guiándola hacia la silla del escritorio, cuando se sentó Alan recargó la espalda en uno de los libreros y se dispuso a preguntarle a su hermana: \"Y cuéntame hermana, ¿Cómo te encuentras?\" Notó cómo su hermana se sorprendió al preguntarle eso. \"Pues bien, ¡Que sorpresa que me preguntaras eso, hermanito!\" Alan se sintió un poco normal al escuchar ese comentario viniendo de su hermana, ya que quería decir que su comportamiento volvía a ser el de siempre; burlón y ocasionalmente grosero. Pasaron unas cuantas horas (que Alan sintió como años) hasta que su hermana y su mamá vieron la hora de irse. Con una actitud neutral Alan se despidió de ellas y unos minutos después cerró el consultorio para irse a casa y tratar de reflexionar acerca de los acontecimientos del día, y preguntarse qué era lo que la vida le estaba guardando.[Chapter 3] (N/A) Comienzo a tener más visitas ¡yay! (^W^)/. Bueno el caso es que me comienza interesar un poco más el punto de vista de Alan pero no sé si sea algo correcto darle un poco más de importancia que a Edith. Está bien solamente trataré de seguir…. *Edith* Cuando Edith despertó se encontró rodeada por el brazo de Thomas quien se encontraba en un sueño profundo, Edith decidió que sería mejor no despertarlo así que optó por salir de la habitación y escribir un poco antes de que ella y Thomas salieran a visitar a su padre al cementerio. \"No es suficiente\" pensó Edith; su historia no le parecía lo suficientemente interesante para impresionar a Ogilvie. Thomas decía lo contrario y Edith sabía porque; Edith sabía que Thomas se había sentido identificado con su personaje, en la manera en la que se había reivindicado Thomas sentía que podía hacer lo mismo y en efecto, lo logró. \"Buenos días\" Edith volteó para ver a Thomas pero él ya estaba a punto de besarla \"Bueno, creo que será mejor que comencemos a prepararnos para visitar a tu padre\" Thomas se separó de Edith dandóle un beso en la frente y se encamino hacia el baño. *Thomas* \"Lucille, ¡Espérame!\" Thomas se encontraba corriendo detrás de Lucille en una especie de campo en el que veía todo en blanco y negro. \"¡Lucille por favor deja de correr! De la nada el camino que Thomas dejaba detrás comenzó a disolverse y lo único que podía ver era cómo sus ojos se iban cerrando hasta que lo único que podía escuchar eran gritos provenientes de dónde estaba Lucille, Thomas intentó abrir sus ojos para ver que sucedía pero por más que intentó no lo logró. De la nada se despertó sudando, volteó para ver a Edith pero se percató de que había salido de la habitación. Salió y la encontró escribiendo; se acercó a ella pensando en su sueño y en lo que le esperaba ese día. Iban de camino al cementerio Edith como siempre agarrada del brazo de Thomas. \"Creo que va a comenzar a llover\" Thomas miró a Edith que estaba mirando al cielo, luego lo volteó a ver a él. \"Entonces creo que será mejor que nos apresuremos\" Thomas le devolvió la mirada pero pudo notar que Edith no lo miraba a él sino a alguien que estaba detrás. Thomas miró hacia atrás solo para encontrar al amigo de Edith, Alan. \"Buenos días, Edith\" Alan se acercó a Edith quien le devolvió el saludo. \"Buen día, Alan\" Thomas pensó que sería mejor tratarlo bien ya que había ayudado a Edith con Lucille cuando estaban en la mansión Sharpe. \"Buen día señor McMichael\" Thomas lo saludó pero no pudo dejar de notar algo en sus ojos; algo que parecía odio \"Pero, ¿Cómo puede odiarme después de lo que hice por él?\" Thomas no podía creer eso pero luego recordó lo que le dijo Alan a Edith cuando intento sacarla de la mansión \"No voy a dejar que te hagan más daño\". Thomas sintió cómo se le hacía un nudo en la garganta, sólo con pensar esas palabras. \"Sir Thomas\" Alan le devolvió el saludo, el mismo brillo en sus ojos. \"Vamos a ver a mi padre, ¿Quieres acompañarnos?\" Thomas miró a Edith, luego a Alan pero ninguno de los dos se molestó en devolverle la mirada. Alan se preocupó más en contestarle a Edith \"No, tengo ciertas cosas que hacer – miró a Thomas – además parece que va a comenzar a llover; será mejor que se den prisa.\" Con eso Alan se despidió de ellos con la cabeza alejándose. Edith y Thomas avanzaron por el cementerio hasta encontrar la tumba del señor Cushing. \"¿Te molestaría dejarme solas unos minutos?\" Edith miró a Thomas con cierto brillo en sus ojos, el mismo que tenían el día que murió su padre. \"Está bien, si necesitas algo llámame.\" Edith se alejó de él, luego se sentó junto a la tumba de su padre y cerró los ojos. Thomas se quedó un momento mirando la escena antes de retirarse, dejando a Edith a solas con su padre. Unos minutos después Thomas se volvió a acercar y vio a Edith igual que antes solo que parecía que estaba hablando, \"Tal vez le esté contando cómo es su vida ahora que no está\". Al ver eso Thomas no pudo evitar sentirse culpable; el y su hermana habían asesinado a muchas personas pero nunca se había sentido culpable. Lucille también había asesinado el espíritu de Thomas, algo de lo que no se dio cuenta hasta que Edith llegó. Thomas no se pudo resistir y se acercó a Edith. \"¿Sucede algo?\" Una lágrima corría por la mejilla de Edith. \"Nunca pensé volverte a ver llorar\" Thomas le sonrió intentando hacerla sentir mejor. \"Y yo nunca pensé volver a llorar en un cementerio\" La sonrisa de Thomas se desvaneció al escuchar eso \"Nunca pensé un mundo sin el a mi lado\" Se sentó a su lado tratando de esconder su mirada culpable \"¿Crees que esté aquí?\" Thomas se sorprendió al escuchar eso; pensaba que ya había olvidado a los fantasmas. \"¿A qué te refieres?\" Thomas la miro esperando a que las palabras llegaran a ella. \"¿Crees que su fantasma siga aquí? Thomas la miraba, pero ella no lo miraba más bien mantenía su mirada en el suelo. Thomas decidió responderle con otra pregunta \"¿Cómo tu madre?\". \"Sí, igual que ella\" Thomas no podía dejar de mirarla, cierta curiosidad en él. \"Supongo, si está aquí debe ser por ti\" Edith despegó su mirada del suelo y levantó la cabeza para mirarlo. \"¿Crees que vea lo mismo que nosotros?\" \"Si, seguramente\" Thomas trató de enfocar su mirada en lo que veía Edith. \"Entonces debe saber cuánto han cambiado las cosas\" La volteó a ver pero estaba otra vez con la mirada perdida. Había comenzado a llover desde que regresaron del cementerio. Thomas y Edith estaban de nuevo en la mansión Cushing, Edith estaba leyéndole su historia a Thomas y el, como siempre, le daba su opinión. \"Creo que faltan ciertas cosas\" Edith se sentó y miró el papel, dudando acerca del ritmo que llevaba su novela. \"Yo opino que cada vez se vuelve más interesante\" Thomas se sentó también pero se acercó a Edith. Ella volteó a verlo mientras sonreía \"Hablo acerca del personaje, no de la historia\". Él le sonrió también mientras se recostaba de vuelta a su lugar en la cama. \"Pues no estoy muy seguro de cómo quieres que sea\". Lo miró y luego devolvió la mirada a la novela. \"Creo que todo dependerá de cómo desarrolles la historia, ¿Recuerdas?\". Edith le sonrió y se recostó a su lado, levantando los papeles para continuar leyendo pero siguió hablando. \"Si, pero yo le ayudo con sus decisiones; yo soy quien lo aconseja\". \"¿Entonces eres cómo su ángel?\" Thomas lo miró con cierta curiosidad en sus ojos. Edith bajó los papeles dejándolos sobre la cama y lo miró \"Supongo que sí – le sonrió- soy cómo su ángel guardián\". \"Que suerte\". Edith lo miró pero él tenía la mirada perdida en el techo. Ella miró a su lado y encontró los papeles; los levantó y siguió leyendo, Thomas cerró los ojos y se recostó sobre su costado cómo queriendo que se diera cuenta de que la escuchaba. Edith pareció comprender por lo que siguió leyendo. *Alan* Se despidió de Edith y de Thomas Sharpe, mientras se alejaba sintió como la mirada fría de Sir Thomas se despegaba de su espalda pero trató de hacer como que no lo notaba. Salió del cementerio y se dirigió hacia la casa de su madre para saludarla a ella y a Eunice. En cuánto llegó las encontró a las dos en la habitación de su hermana quien estaba envuelta en un río de lágrimas. \"¿Madre, que sucede?\" Dejó su abrigo sobre una silla que estaba junto a la puerta y se acercó hacia donde estaban. \"¡Nadie me quiere!\" Parecía que alguien había rechazado a su hermana y está no lo había tomado muy bien. \"Tranquilízate hija, ya encontrarás a algu…\" Su madre fue interrumpida por ella quien parecía estar completamente distraída con sus problemas. \"¡Tu no lo comprendes! – se llevó las manos hacia la cara- ¡Edith me robó mi final feliz y ahora él!\" Alan comprendió que estaba relacionando su ruptura amorosa con la nueva vida de Edith. \"Eunice querida, creo que tú eras demasiado buena para ese Sir Thomas\" Su madre levantó la mirada para ver a Alan y esté comprendió que quería que la ayudara. \"Creo que nuestra madre tiene razón Eunice, tal vez tu simplemente estás destinada a otra cosa…\" \"¿¡Cómo es que esa chica rara se llevó al Barón?!\" Alan miró un poco confundido a su hermana quien guardó silencio de repente y se limpió los ojos con las palmas de las manos. \"¿Que sucede hija?\" Parecía que Eunice tenía un plan y su madre lo había notado perfectamente. \"¡Lo voy a recuperar!\" Eunice se levantó y apartó a Alan bruscamente con el brazo, tirándolo en el piso. El solo la miró y se levantó del piso antes de que ella azotara la puerta, con su madre siguiéndola. \"Esto me preocupa\" Alan pensó, cualquier cosa que su hermana estuviera planeando no parecía algo que se pudiera pasar por alto. Salió hacia su casa pensando en el plan de su hermana y en el problema que Eunice se podía meter. (N/A)¿Salseo? (¿Pleito?), no lo sé, déjenme saberlo :3 (¡lo necesito!) ¡No estoy muy segura de esto así que por favor dejen comentarios![Chapter 4] (N/A) ¡Hola! La verdad es que me estoy quedando sin ideas para los próximos capítulos y que nadie pone reviews (me lastiman :´v) pero gracias a Jaishimahara por sus ideas y a todos los que han estado leyendo mi fic :3. Thomas abrió los ojos en una oscuridad incomoda destapado. Miro hacia el otro lado de la cama donde Edith solía dormir, pero se encontró con un espacio vacío y las sabanas tiradas en el piso. Se levantó de la cama dispuesto a buscarla, sintió temor al no encontrarla en su escritorio, bajó las escaleras con el corazón a toda velocidad temiendo que algo le estuviera pasando a su esposa. Sintió como todas sus preocupaciones se resbalaban por su espalda cuando la vio acurrucada en el piso mirando hacia la ventana. \"Hola\" le susurro mientras se sentaba frente a ella. \"Hola\" \"Una pesadilla ¿cierto?\" No pudo evitar fijarse en como sus ojos reflejaban las estrellas y adquirían un brillo que lo hacían darse cuenta de lo especial que ella era para él. Ella solamente guardó silencio y siguió mirando hacia la ventana. \"No te preocupes, yo estoy aquí para ti\" se levantó y se sentó junto a ella dejándola recargar su cabeza en su pecho. No supo cuánto tiempo estuvieron ahí hasta que sintió la respiración de Edith. Suspiró y se levantó cargando a Edith, subió las escaleras y la dejó en la cama para luego recostarse junto a ella. Thomas despertó con los rayos del sol que se colaban por la ventana con los brazos de Edith rodeando su cuello y su cabeza recargada en su pecho. \"Hola\" le dijo cuando abrió los ojos. \"Hola\" Edith se sentó, Thomas la sentía un poco distante \"Creo que iré a caminar por ahí\" con esto se levantó y comenzó a buscar su ropa en el armario \"¿No quieres que te acompañe?\" le preguntó mientras se sentaba. Edith estaba mirando hacia dónde él estaba, pero no estaba mirándolo a él exactamente. Se vistió y se fue dejando a Thomas solo, un poco preocupado y asustado a la vez. \"Esto es…. nuevo\" pensó en voz alta cuando escuchó a Edith cerrar la puerta principal. Thomas estuvo recostado unas horas mirando hacia el techo con cierto sentimiento de vacío que ya conocía pero que decidía ignorar. Se vistió y salió al jardín dónde buscó un lugar para sentarse. Se recostó en el césped y miró hacia el cielo, pensando en cómo había sido la infancia de Edith en ese patio con su padre y Alan que por lo que había escuchado había sido su mejor amigo en su infancia. \"No puedo creer que me haya perdonado por lo que le hice…. hicimos\" pensó al ver uno de los cortes que le hizo Lucille cuando logró detenerla. \"¿ Por qué me escogió a mí, si Lucille y yo le hicimos tanto daño, y no a Alan McMichael?\" Pasó una mano por su pelo antes de sentarse. Se quedó pensando un poco, con la mirada fija y distante en una nube, pero fue expulsado de sus sentimientos cuando alguien tocó el timbre. Camino hasta la entrada y esperó a que volvieran a tocar el timbre, un poco inclinado sobre la puerta y un poco nervioso de quien estuviera afuera, cuando volvieron a timbrar abrió la puerta rápidamente y se sorprendió un poco al ver que era Ogilvie. \"Sir Thomas\" lo saludó. \"¿En qué puedo ayudarle?\" Thomas le preguntó sabiendo perfectamente que buscaba a Edith. \"¿Se encuentra la señorita Edith Cushing?\" \"Salió\" Thomas le dijo, con una expresión seria en su cara. \"Está bien. ¿Podría decirle que vine a verla? No quiero que esto tan importante se pase por alto.\" \"No se preocupe, yo le avisaré.\" Con esto Ogilvie se fue y Thomas cerró la puerta, con varias dudas acerca de Edith en su mente, pero que decidió ignorar para ir a buscar a su querida Edith. No estoy muy segura de esto. Lo bueno es que puedo editar/borrar esto luego :´v.[Chapter 5] (N/A) ¡Hola! Lamento haber tardado tanto en actualizar es solo que entre las tareas y los exámenes no tenía tiempo suficiente. Gracias a los que han estado leyendo mi fic y a los que han estado dejando reviews (me motivan :3) así que... aquí voy. Edith salió de la mansión decidida a no regresar en unas cuantas horas. No estaba muy segura de a dónde iría pero no quería regresar hasta haber sacado todo eso que tenía en la mente. Le preocupaba Thomas y cómo reaccionaría a su ausencia ya que no le había dado muchas explicaciones cuando decidió irse. Camino hasta el parque dónde había tenido un picnic con los Sharpe cuando recién los había conocido. Se sentó en una de las bancas que tenía vista hacia el árbol dónde Lucille había recogido a una de las mariposas. Se sentó y contempló a una niña que corría alrededor de su madre. Observó cómo se dedicaban miradas cariñosas, cuidando que no cayera al césped. Sintió cierta tristeza pues le recordó a esas noches cuando se despertaba, atormentada por alguna pesadilla, y su madre la calmaba y leían juntas hasta que se volviera a quedar dormida. Recordó también la noche en la que el espíritu de su madre volvió a ella. Sintió un escalofrío y se ruborizo un poco, luego volvió a dirigir la mirada al árbol y recordó cuándo conoció a Thomas, en cómo se interesó en su escrito desde el principio y en como la invitó a bailar a pesar de que debía bailar con Eunice. ¿Por qué a ella? Se hacia esa pregunta al menos cada día. Thomas era algo inalcanzable cuando entró a las oficinas de su padre. Pero al parecer a Thomas no le importó lo que todo mundo decía de ella y la escogió. Edith se sentía agradecida por ello, nunca pensó en comprometerse con alguien. La imagen que tenía de sí misma cambió casi por completo cuando llegó a Allerdale Hall. Pensó en cómo Lucille intentó asesinarla a ella y a Alan y en la manera en la que su mirada le hacía pensar que no tenía sentimiento alguno. En cambio la mirada de Thomas la hacía sentir segura y sus ojos azules la reconfortaban. L costaba trabajo pensar cómo alguien como Thomas, considerado y caballeroso, podía ser hermano de alguien tan fría y falsa como Lucille. Levantó la vista hacia el cielo y comenzó a recordar las falsas sonrisas que le daban los empleados de la mansión después de la muerte de su madre. Recordó cuando la tristeza la invadía y deseaba a su madre más que nunca. No pudo contener las lágrimas y miró hacia abajo para tratar de disimularlas. \"Edith, ¿Te encuentras bien?\" Le preguntó una voz familiar. \"Si\" miró hacia arriba tratando de averiguar quién era \"No lo creo, ¿Qué te sucede?\" Volvió a preguntar Alan en un tono más exigente. \"Estoy bien, solo estoy recordando un poco\" Alan la miró un poco desconfiado de sus palabras \"¿Quieres pasar a mi consultorio un rato?\" \"Está bien\" le contestó mientras se limpiaba las lágrimas con el dorso de la mano. Alan esperó a que se levantara y le tomó la mano mientras cruzaban el parque. Cuando estaban a punto de llegar Edith Noto que Alan la miraba así que decidió conversar un poco con él. \"¿Cómo se encuentran tu madre y tu hermana?\" \"Edith, no hagas esto.\" \"¿Hacer que?\" \"Empezar esta conversación tan forzada\" Alan la miró con una expresión seria. Edith guardó silencio el resto del camino hasta que llegaron al consultorio de Alan. Una vez ahí el inició con su interrogatorio. Una vez más perdón por haber tardado tanto. DEJEN REVIEWS XD.[Chapter 6] (N/A) Emmm… ok la vedad es que debo empezar a actualizar más seguido y debo seguir agradeciéndoles una y otra vez por leer mi fanfic. Perdón por hacer el capítulo anterior tan corto es solo que sentía que no podía tardar más (intentaré hacer este un poco más largo). Así que aquí vamos… \"Edith, tu sabes que no puedo verte así y que yo sé que me estás mintiendo cuando dices que estás bien\" le dijo Alan en su papel de \"detective\" el mismo que había tomado cuando estaba enferma y débil en Allerdale Hall. \"Alan, no te estoy mintiendo\" \"¡Está bien! Si no me lo quieres contar está bien por mí- tomó aire- solo quiero que vuelvas a ser la misma de antes ¿recuerdas? La Edith que solía soñar con publicar su novela y ser independiente de su padre.\" Edith lo miró, no pudo evitar notar como movía los dedos nerviosamente sobre su escritorio y miraba hacia abajo cada dos por tres para comprobar su reacción ante sus palabras. Alan suspiró y continuó \"Solo quiero saber que te sucede y quiero ayudar si es necesario\" Edith lo miró y no pudo evitar sentirse culpable por hacer que Alan se sintiera así \"Te prometo que te lo diré cuando sea necesario\" El la miró, inseguro de sus palabras, y esperó a que continuara \"¿Sabes? Creo que ahora solo necesito estar a solas\" Tomó su abrigo y salió, dejando a Alan a solas en su consultorio *Thomas* Salió corriendo de la mansión Cushing a toda prisa, poniéndose su abrigo mientras corría, y tropezando con los puestos y carruajes que se encontraban en las calles. Entró en pánico cuando no la encontró en el edificio de su padre. Corrió hasta terminar agotado \" ¿Cómo puede ser que no esté por ninguna parte? \" Pensó, agobiado por la situación. Pensó que seguramente ya habría llegado a la mansión así que decidió pasar por el parque. Se fijó en las familias que paseaban por el parque y recordó cuando tuvo un picnic con Edith y Alan. En ese momento tenía cierto desprecio por Alan, pero cuando lo ayudó a sacar a Edith de Allerdale Hall se dio cuenta de que, a pesar de entrometerse en su relación con Edith, era un buen hombre que trataba de hacer lo correcto por Edith. El día que pasaron en el parque Alan lo miraba con cierta desaprobación, ciertamente Thomas no lo culpaba al haber cambiado de opinión hizo algo que, socialmente, era muy grosero. Honestamente haber bailado con Edith en una fiesta que había sido organizada para celebrar su compromiso con Eunice no había sido su idea más inteligente. Recordó su baile con Edith. Cuando comenzaron a bailar fue como si fueran uno. Podía ver su reflejo en sus hermosos ojos, que brillaban cada vez que él se acercaba. En verdad estaba perdido sin ella. Cuando se dio cuenta estaba sentado en la misma banca en la que estuvo con Edith. Se levantó, cabizbajo, y comenzó a caminar de regreso a la mansión. Estaba tan perdido en sus pensamientos que cuando iba caminando chocó con alguien. \"Lo siento\" dijo mirando hacia arriba… ¡Suspenso! xD ok no… al parecer nadie ha leído el último capítulo… es bastante corto (sentí que tenía que subir algo… aunque fuera corto ) Bueno… gracias a los que han estado leyendo mi fanfic últimamente (merecen mucho lof :3) espero poder seguir subiéndolo y espero poder actualizar más seguido… :3[Chapter 7] (N/A) ¡Hola! Demonios…. Hace mucho tiempo que no actualizo…. Meh… no es que lo leyera tanta gente… bueno, sé que es repetitivo pero nunca son suficientes los agradecimientos por seguir leyendo después de ser una mala persona que nunca sube más caps. y los deja por ahí…. Lo siento xD Thomas miró hacia arriba y saltó de sorpresa al ver a… ¿Lucille? Él sabía que no era ella… no podía ser ella … se suponía que estaba muerta... que ahora estaba en paz… Al menos eso era lo que pensaba Thomas pero ahora dudaba de todo lo que había tomado por seguro. De la nada, el suelo despareció y Thomas se encontró cayendo. En el momento en el que iba a tocar el piso se despertó. Se había quedado dormido en la banca. Parecía que habían pasado horas, pues todo estaba oscuro y ya no había tanta gente cerca. Tembloroso, se levantó de la banca y decidió ir a casa. Se sentía despedazado física y mentalmente. Al llegar a la habitación que compartía con Edith, se desplomó en la cama, dejando que todos esos pensamientos se desvanecieran y sin ningún esfuerzo se volvió a quedar dormido. *Edith* Edith se encontraba arrepintiéndose de todas las decisiones que había tomado hasta ese momento. Se encontraba en un tren. De camino a Inglaterra. En serio, no sabía porque había tomado una decisión tan precipitada. \" Oh. Claro.\" Pensó al recordar el sueño que tuvo. El sueño que la llevo a tomar una decisión tan… \" tonta\" pensó. Edith se encontraba corriendo en un campo. A lo lejos podía ver a Thomas quien también iba corriendo detrás de… podría ser… no, no debería ser ella. Thomas se encontraba corriendo detrás de Lucille. Pero no era la Lucille que intentó matarla, sino que era una Lucille que parecía feliz de verdad. Alguien quien no parecía haber visto la muerte de tan cerca. Edith aceleró el paso. Logró alcanzar a Thomas, a quién tomó del brazo tirándolos al suelo. Cuando se levantó un poco para ver su rostro se alejó de un salto, horrorizada por lo que había visto. Estaba herido. Había sido apuñalado en el pecho varias veces y tenía un cuchillo clavado bajo el ojo, en su lado izquierdo. También lloraba y tenía los ojos perdidos en algún punto del cielo. Edith no deseaba ver jamás a Thomas en ese estado. El Thomas sonriente que solía protegerla de las pesadillas que amenazaban con atacarla por las noches no se parecía nada al que se encontraba a unos pocos metros delante de ella. -¡Destrúyela! Escuchó un grito a lo lejos-¡Debes destruir la mansión de los Sharpe!- vio a Enola Sciotti a lo lejos gritándole esto. Esa no era la misma mujer que había visto. Ella había visto a su fantasma con su bebé, pero esta era una humana. - ¡Si quieres salvarlo, entonces debes destruirla!- Edith sabía exactamente de quien hablaba- ¡Debes alejarlo de Thomas! En ese momento Edith despertó con Thomas a un lado suyo, y sabía lo que debía hacer. No quería ver a Thomas dañar a nadie, y lo último que quería ver era a Alan herido. \" Lo siento tanto\" pensó mientras miraba a Thomas Esa era la historia de cómo Edith se encontraba en un tren con el objetivo de destruir Allerdale Hall, el hogar de una de las personas que más amaba en todo el mundo, a cualquier costo. Y no pensaba detenerse hasta asegurarse de que estuvieran a salvo. (N/A) Edith ya es toda una niña grande *sonrisa de padre orgulloso* ahora si prometo acabar esto (ya se va a acabar mis queridos amantes de Thomas :3) porque la verdad, si lo hago más largo nunca van a tener su final (que no prometo nada bueno… lo siento tanto para los que siguen leyendo esto :'v) y bueno, ya me callo un mes y les prometo que actualizaré pronto.[Chapter 8] (N /A) Bueno... finalmente me digno a actualizar. Lo siento, había algo que hacía que se olvidara... :'( pero bueno, ya estoy de vuelta dispuesta a escribir y a terminar esto. Edith miraba el paisaje que iba quedando detrás del tren a medida que avanzaba, preparándose mentalmente para terminar con aquello que amenazaba su seguridad y la de Thomas. No tenía nada concreto todavía, pues no sabía exactamente a que se enfrentaba. Solo sabía que debía seguir el consejo de Enola Sciotti ya que conocía el peligro que corría al haber conocido un poco mejor a los Sharpe. Una voz que se encontraba en la parte de atrás de su cabeza le recordaba que Thomas seguía en América esperando verla de vuelta. No podía evitar sentirse culpable, ¡Lo había dejado sin decirle a donde iba! ¡Claro que debía sentirse culpable! Thomas nunca le haría eso... O al menos eso era lo que Edith quería creer. La verdadera que nunca había estado segura de cuales eran las intenciones de Thomas. Nunca había estado segura de como iba a ser su relación una vez que estuvieran lejos de Lucille, lo que no se había esperado era ver a Thomas tan... destrozado. Entendía lo que pasaba, o al menos eso creía, era su hermana después de todo y Edith nunca supo como se sentía tener una. Todos eso pensamientos se esfumaron cuando escucho un golpe fuera de su cabina de tren. Se levantó rápidamente a ver que sucedía afuera, abrió la puerta de la cabina y se encontró sola en el pasillo. \" Pero que...\" Otro golpe. Esta vez a su derecha, en la cabina que se encontraba junto a la suya. No podía callar a su curiosidad, así que decidió ir a averiguar la causa de esos golpes. Entro a la cabina y se sobresaltó al escuchar otro golpe cerca de la ventana. Se acercó lentamente, dejando la puerta abierta, sintiendo como su corazón latía velozmente contra su pecho. Mientras se acercaba podía escuchar como los golpes se iban intensificando y tuvo que contenerse para no gritar cuando la puerta se azotó a sus espaldas. Respiró profundamente antes de dirigirse de regreso a su cabina, derrotada y cansada al mismo tiempo. Lo único que tenía en mente en cuanto regresó a su sitio era salvar aquel hogar por el que tanto había luchado. Ok... se que fue corto, peo les prometo (a los que sigan leyendo xD) que el siguiente (QUE NO PROMETO QUE SEA EL ÚLTIMO Y NO SE CUANDO SUBIRÉ) será más largo 3 Hasta entonces...

That way, if you've seen the film you'll be able to imagine her into it, and it'll all make sense when the characters drop hints and slip up. It also means that there will be spoilers in this story, so I really must suggest that you watch the film first. I do not write scenes chronologically, but as I think of them, because in my life writing is a continuous process that takes up most of my free moments. I do apologise, as sometimes it gets confusing when I jump from scene to scene, but I promise there will be a finished product one day :) EDIT: whenever the words 'mama' or 'papa' or 'mummy' are written through this story, they are intended to be as English as possible. Sort of like how Thomas says ''Papa really had to put his back into it\"in the film. Just to avoid confusion as I amreally not sure how to spell them properly! xD Thank you so much for reading! \"Thomas!\" Thomas appeared in the doorway to the scullery and came briskly towards her. \"What is it?\" \"I saw a woman in the elevator,\" Edith said matter-of-factly. Thomas frowned. \"It must have been Lucille.\" \"It wasn't Lucille.\" Thomas chuckled and checked the elevator shaft, which was empty. \"Then it must have been Florence.\" \"Who is Florence?\" Edith asked quickly, a little nervous. Thomas smiled kindly and placed his hands on her shoulders.\" \"I'll fetch her for you,\" he said softly. He turned and leant over the rail to inspect the elevator shaft. \"This damned old thing has a mind of its own; the wires are affected by the damp in the house. It's unavoidable I'm afraid. Goes down to the clay mines in the basement,\" he said quickly, smoothly. He looked again into her eyes and gestured towards the floor. \"Never ever go below this level.\" Edith nodded, and Thomas's wonderful smile returned. At that moment, Lucille appeared from the hallway, and Thomas spun around to greet her. \"Ah, Lucille!\" \"Thomas.\" Thomas' joy did not leave him as he leaned toward the doorframe and called to the rest of the house before embracing his sister. \" Florence! \" Edith stood awkwardly as the Sharpe siblings hugged quietly for a moment, before Lucille peered at her over her brother's shoulder and said \"Welcome, Edith,\" in a friendly manner. Edith was a little surprised by her warmth, but smiled. \"Thank you.\" Lucille nodded, and Thomas let go as she presented him with an envelope. \"A delivery. Your parts are here from Birmingham,\" she told him. \"They're being held at the depo, for collection.\" \"Ah, wonderful,\" Thomas beamed. A second passed as he took Lucille's coat and hung it up, then a small voice echoed from the doorway. \"Thomas?\" Edith jumped, then looked across to the door, where a little girl stood in a sweet grey skirt with braces over a whiteish blouse with little capped sleeves. On closer inspection, she was perhaps not so little, maybe up to thirteen years old. Thomas turned and smiled when he saw her. This was a different smile though, a more loving one. He held out a hand to her. \"Come in, darling, and meet my wife.\" His tone was suddenly fond, something Edith had not yet heard. He clearly cared for this girl on a more guardian-esque level. Florence's face lit up at the mention of marriage, and she came in closer and took his hand. Thomas grinned at Edith and put his other arm around the child. \"This is Florence, mine and Lucille's youngest sister,\" he said quietly. The girl beside him looked up at her with big eyes, and inclined her head politely. Edith nodded back with a smile as Thomas addressed the child. \"Florrie, this is Edith. She will be living here now, with us,\" he told her kindly. She looked back at him with those inquisitive eyes, and the smile widened as she bit her lip. \"Nice to meet you, Florence,\" Edith said kindly, tilting her head. The little girl's smile turned shy, and she moved a little closer to Thomas' side. Edith noticed that her face, angular and beautiful, was very like her older siblings. She was especially alike Thomas in her stature, expression and mannerisms, as she'd briefly demonstrated, and for some reason this made Edith feel very warmed towards her. However, what caught Edith's attention most strongly was the child's unusual colouration. Outside in the modern world she would be perceived differently, perhaps, but her copper coloured plaits and striking green eyes seemed so eerily out of place amongst the colouring of the others. She looked as though she was the child of the house itself, and the clay beneath it. As Edith took in her appearance, Thomas nudged her forward, and the child walked shyly over to her, reaching to take her hand. Edith couldn't look away from her as she tugged, and knelt down to her level. Florence's smile was infectious, and Edith felt a surge of emotion as the little girl wrapped her arms around her neck and kissed her cheek. She was freezing cold, and the movement was swift, almost too graceful for a child. Yet, Edith knew she was completely in love with her. \"Hello, Lady Sharpe. Welcome to our house,\" Florence said quietly, though her voice was kind. She was not scary in the slightest, and Edith felt a more natural smile cross her lips, and put her arms around her. \"Thank you,\" Edith said. She paused, then added \"Please, call me Edith.\" Florence giggled adorably and Edith found it utterly gorgeous. Thomas seemed to burst with pride, though Lucille stood silently in the doorframe, her gaze fixed on Florence like she was afraid to let her out of her sight. Given the state of the house, with its holy roof and rotting floorboards, Edith suspected she had good reason. Barely a second passed before Lucille fidgeted and glided across to the fire, where she lifted the kettle to its hook. She did not look at them as she addressed the child. \"Florence, darling, go and fetch yourself something with sleeves. You will surely freeze in that shirt,\" she said smoothly. Florence pulled away from Edith at once, looking a little sheepish, and ran past Thomas out of the smaller door. Thomas turned to watch her, and pressed his lips together as he sighed quietly. Edith stood up and dusted herself down, watching her husband, but started when she noticed Florrie had literally vanished from sight. Lucille turned to face her, a smile on her lips as she inclined her head. \"She isn't used to meeting new people. Please excuse her.\" Edith smiled, but it was tight, and she couldn't look away from where the child had last been. \"Of course. She is very sweet.\" Lucille and Thomas shared a glance that Edith did not see, and Lucille forced calmness into her voice. \"My dear, are you all right?\" Before Edith could answer, Thomas chuckled and that charming smile returned. \"Edith saw a shadow earlier, it was a little disconcerting.\" Lucille chuckled, turning back to the fire to fetch the kettle. \"All that lives in this house are shadows and creaks and groans.\" While Edith bathed, Thomas and Lucille sat side by side in their dark, colourless kitchen, following the ritual of brewing the special tea. In response to Thomas' somewhat stilted mutterings, Lucille took his chin in her fingers and turned his face towards herself. \"You chose her. Why?\" she whispered, eyes questioning. Thomas simply looked back, offering no answer. She guessed he didn't really know either, innocent as he was. The slightly sinister mood was broken when Florence came skipping into the kitchen, having swapped her short sleeves for a big knitted jumper that completely swamped her. Lucille stopped what she was doing and looked at her with a slight frown as she went straight to Thomas, who wrapped an arm around her. \"There you are,\" he said brightly, smiling a her. \"What do you think of Edith?\" Lucille twitched, and briefly glanced at her brother. What was he thinking, asking the child things like that ? \"I like her,\" Florence said sweetly, and Thomas couldn't help the grin that spread across his face. Lucille stood quickly and made a spectacle of arranging the jars neatly on their shelf. \"Good, I'm glad,\" Thomas told Florrie gently, rubbing her back. Edith crouched on the floor behind Thomas as he poked the fire gently, murmuring to her in a comforting sort of way. She had begun to feel almost normal again after the sound of the chimneys, safe with him, when there was a creak at the door, and she just about leapt out of her skin. Instantly, Thomas' arm was around her and her hands in his, and he shushed her with a chuckle. \"Steady now. It's only Florrie,\" he soothed. Edith collected herself, then looked at the doorway, where the little girl was indeed stood in a nightgown. \"Are you all right, my love?\" Thomas asked softly. She hesitated for a moment, before walking into the room. She was in a simple, unembellished nightgown that reached the floor. Her hair, earlier twisted into braids laced with black ribbons, was loose. In the firelight the colour was a rich red, and Edith noticed how long and luscious her curls were. They reached her waist, similarly to Edith's. The little girl smiled, twisting her dress in her hands. \"I came to say goodnight. Lucille said Edith hoped for a warm welcome, so I thought I'd come and find you. I'm sorry for startling you,\" she said softly. Then she chuckled to herself and shrugged her shoulders. \"I have a tendency to make people jump. I will try my hardest not to, I promise.\" Edith smiled, somewhat relieved to have found someone even remotely reminiscent of the outside world. \"Well, thank you, Florence. That's very kind.\" Little Florrie smiled, and Edith placed herself back on the chair and leaned forward, glancing at Thomas, who was watching her curiously. \"Here, how about some tea before bed?\" she asked kindly. Florence bit her lip, but didn't move as Thomas stuttered. \"Oh, no .\" He stood hurriedly and touched Edith's wrist. Confused, she retracted her arm. He smiled at her, then winked at Florrie. \"Little girls must not drink tea before bedtime. It's not good for them,\" he said lightly. He walked forward and tapped his fingers under Florrie's chin. \"I'll fetch you some milk from the kitchen.\" He patted her shoulder and vanished, Florrie shrugging her little shoulders as Edith watched. \"Lucille says that was Mother's favourite rule,\" she said brightly, reaching over her shoulder to gather her hair so she could plait it. Edith noticed what she was doing and smiled, patting the settee beside her. \"Here, why don't you let me do that?\" Florence smiled her adorable smile and sat down beside Edith readily. As she turned her back Edith separated her hair into three parts and began to braid them. \"How come I never saw you back at home in America?\" she asked curiously. This was a matter she had been thinking about constantly since the morning. Little Florrie shrugged. \"I stayed here while Lucille and Thomas travelled. I wasn't completely alone, sometimes the engineers were doing maintenance on the machine outside,\" she explained happily. At this point, Thomas reappeared with a glass of milk in his hand. He smiled when he saw the two of them, having heard Florrie's last sentence. \"Florence here knows the secrets of this house better than anyone else,\" he told Edith. He looked at Florence with a nod, and held the glass to her. \"So if you hear anything strange, it's only her moving about. Isn't that right, darling?\" Edith looked at the back of Florence's head, which nodded happily as she looked up at her brother and quickly drank the small glass of milk. Somehow, she thought that that last sentence was more meaningful than it seemed. Thomas sighed and watched his sister with the same fond gaze as before. \"We had hoped to bring her across to America once we were settled, but I suppose that was never to be,\" he said thoughtfully, taking the empty glass from Florrie and setting it on the tray. After a moment, Edith finished the braid and tied the ribbon around it, letting it fall to Florence's spine and leaning to look at her. \"There, all done,\" she said kindly. Florrie beamed and turned to hug Edith tightly. \"Thank you. Goodnight, new sister,\" she said brightly, childishly. Edith couldn't help herself- she beamed too, and wrapped her arms around the child. \"Goodnight.\" Florence let go and stood up, bouncing into her brother's arms. Thomas bent down over her and held her close to him, kissing her hair and squeezing her. He clearly adored her. \"Goodnight, Thomas.\" \"Goodnight, my darling.\" They let go and smiled at each other, then Florence turned and ran to the door. Edith glanced only briefly at Thomas to gauge his reaction, but when she looked back the hallway was empty. Florrie had vanished. \"Where did she go?\" she asked quietly, startled. Thomas chuckled gently. \"Like I said, she knows every nook and cranny of this house. She can appear and vanish wherever she likes. A typical inquisitive child with a talent for hiding,\" he promised her. He chuckled. \"Sometimes we can go days without seeing her, Lucille especially.\" Edith was not convinced. \"She is your sister?\" \"Yes.\" \"What age?\" \"She's just gone ten.\" Edith gasped. \"And you left her here alone? \" Thomas pressed his lips together and regarded her cautiously. He looked at the floor, jaw tensing, then back at her. He sat down beside her. \"Florence is no incompetent child. She's suffered too much in her short life to remain innocent and untroubled. Lucille is always anxious to return to her, and we would never do anything to frighten her. Trust me on that,\" he said honestly, his voice low. Edith read the sincerity in his eyes, and relaxed after a moment. He smiled then, and passed her another cup of tea. \"Right. I'll have a bath, I think. If you happen to fall asleep, I won't wake you,\" he said softly, planting a kiss on Edith's forehead.[Chapter 2] When Edith awoke suddenly in the morning, she was comforted to find Thomas asleep beside her. She shuddered, glad to be back in the real world, as she was sure she'd had a nightmare. It took a moment for her to notice that she could hear music from downstairs. Not wanting to disturb her husband, Edith slipped out of the bed and went to the door. As she went out to the hall she heard the piano more clearly, and quiet voices down in the parlour. Lucille was sat playing the piano, with Florence perched on the stool beside her. As Lucille hummed and played the main melody, Florence added a sweet tune with one hand. Edith stood quietly in the doorway, watching them together. Lucille smiled at Florrie encouragingly whenever she glanced up at her, and Florence in turn was nodding her head as her little fingers flitted over a few keys. In Lucille's eyes, Edith could see pure adoration. Edith stepped further into the room to examine the latin words carved above the fireplace, but Lucille noticed her and the music stopped abruptly. \"To the hills, we raise our eyes,\" Lucille translated. Embarrassed, Edith blushed. \"I'm sorry, I interrupted you. What was that music?\" \"Edith!\" Florence chirped happily. Edith smiled at her as Lucille smiled a little and ran a hand through her long hair. \"Not at all. It is the lullaby I used to sing to Thomas when we were young. I play it for Florence now,\" she said smoothly, continuing to stroke Florrie's hair. Edith smiled a little as she imagined it. \"I can just see you in here as children,\" she wondered softly, glancing around the room. \"You, playing the piano. Thomas coming up with wild inventions...\" Her voice was dreamy, and Lucille couldn't help but chuckle. She tapped Florrie's shoulder and she looked up at her. \"Why don't you go and wake Thomas?\" The little girl nodded and hopped off the stool, running out of the room and up the huge staircase. Edith watched her go with a chuckle, and Lucille smiled sadly. \"We were not allowed in here as children. We were confined to the nursery, in the attic. Mother played the piano, though. Sometimes we'd hear her through the floor.\" She sighed, and looked up at the ceiling. \"That's how we knew she was back in the country.\" Darting out of the parlour as Lucille had ordered her to, Florence ran all the way up the stairs and along the hall to her brother's bedroom. She was used to her sister sending her out of the room when they had other people in the house- Lucille was obsessive over keeping her safely out of reach. Some people did terrible things to little girls, she said. Florence stopped to peek through the slightly open door, and saw that Thomas was still asleep on his side of the bed. Biting her lip to stop herself grinning, Florrie slipped through the door and crept across the room. When she was close enough, the little girl threw herself onto the bed, where Thomas awoke just in time to catch her. \" Boo !\" He wrapped his arms around her and growled into her hair as she burst into fits of giggles, and rolled so as to trap her in his arms. \"Good morning ,\" he said incredulously. \"What do you want at this time of the day?\" His tone was teasing, and Florrie stuck her bottom lip out in a fake pout as she answered somewhat honestly. \"Breakfast. Lucille said I had to wait until you got up, and you were taking too long,\" she whined. Thomas chuckled and squeezed her tighter. \"Oh, you poor thing.\" He released her and pushed himself up against the headboard, before stretching and pulling her across his lap, where she curled up and closed her eyes. Thomas sighed and his smile dissipated as he ran a finger along her cheekbone. She was underweight, so it was too obvious under her skin. \"I'm sorry, my love, but I don't think we have anything more than what's left of Lucille's porridge. I know you hate it,\" he mumbled sadly. Florrie opened an eye to look up at him, and snuggled a little more into his lap. \"It's ok, Edith can have mine,\" she answered lightly. Thomas' heart melted; she was so kind, this little girl. He was both grateful and astonished that he and Lucille had managed to raise her into even a half decent human being, what with how useless their parents had been. \"Well then, you can have mine,\" he whispered to her, smiling once more. Lucille had planned on going to buy such things as eggs and milk soon, anyway. Once Edith had washed and dressed, Thomas was already out working on his machine and Lucille had left to buy groceries. Florence was sat alone at the kitchen table scraping every last bit out of her bowl of porridge when Edith went in to find her, the little dog scurrying around at her feet. The little girl smiled when she entered and pushed a second bowl across the table towards her. \"Morning, Florrie,\" Edith smiled, walking to the table. Florence beamed. \"Good morning. We figured you wouldn't be long, so Thomas made your porridge too. It's still warm,\" she said brightly. Edith chuckled and sat down, picking up the bowl and taking a bite. It had the same bitter taste as the tea, but it wasn't quite as bad as when Lucille made it. Edith suspected that was just something she'd have to get used to. \"It looks like it's just you and me this morning,\" Edith said thoughtfully. Then she had an idea, and leaned across to smirk at Florrie. \"How about you show me where you like to hide? I won't tell anyone, I promise. I don't even know my way around yet.\" Little Florence's eyes seemed to sparkle for a moment, before she checked herself and frowned down at her now empty bowl. \"Lucille says I'm not to. She says sometimes the floor is too weak for anyone bigger than me, that it will break.\" Her voice was sad, maybe even a tad frustrated. Edith wondered whether Lucille was a little overly protective of her little sister. \"Alright. How about we go outside? There's no snow yet, we can take our little doggy for a walk,\" she decided. Florence smiled and nodded, her eyes gleaming. Edith wondered if her siblings ever offered to play with her any more. The young woman stood and smoothed her dress, then took their bowls to the sink and rinsed them. As she turned back to the table, she reached out and took Florence's hand, and smiled at her. \"Come on, let's fetch our coats.\" For most of the morning, Edith walked around the vast expanses of the hall's grounds with Florrie's hand clasped tightly in hers as the little dog ran around them chasing its ball. The child giggled and sang and skipped along, clearly enjoying every second of being outside with someone less serious than her sister and less busy than her brother. After some time, Lucille returned, and Edith couldn't help but notice how Florence seemed uneasy. \"Are you alright, sweetie?\" she asked gently, looking at the child with kind eyes. Florence fidgeted, and looked over her shoulder at the house. \"Lucille will be looking for me. She doesn't like it when I leave the house without her knowing,\" she said softly. Edith frowned, but ran a hand through Florence's hair. \"You go on back, then. I will be fine out here,\" she promised. Florence looked at her and smiled, although the sparkle had gone. \"Ok. Don't forget lunch,\" she said sweetly, before turning and running back across the grounds towards the huge house. It loomed like a monster over her, a creature looking to devour her as she grew nearer, and Edith watched her vanish into a secret door somewhere near the back of it. Edith couldn't help but think of Thomas saying 'Florence knows this house better than anyone'. When Edith found Thomas' workshop in the attic, she was taken aback. Drawings, designs and mechanisms hung from every wall, and the floor was a maze of workbenches and to-be-fixed machines that weaved around the beams that stretched floor to ceiling. Edith could see Thomas at the back, sat at a desk with Florence on his knee, clearly showing her the workings of something. For a minute or two, Edith stood quietly, leaning in the doorway, just watching them together. Thomas seemed alive, his voice bright as he pointed out every little moving part of whatever it was on the desk. Florence watched him with huge eyes, listening to everything he said and helping him to unscrew and deconstruct mechanisms- his other hand was on her waist, keeping her from falling as she leant over the desk. The tartan blanket Edith had seen in their bedroom was wrapped around the both of them, as it was freezing cold up here. She continued to watch them for another moment, enjoying the fact they hadn't noticed her arrival. (Bit of a gap. Sorry!)[Chapter 3] When Edith was sleeping, Thomas crept out of the bed and left the room. He moved along to the other side of the house, where Florence's bedroom was, and went in. She was wrapped in blankets, propped against the wall as Lucille stroked her hair and read to her. She was a very sick child, and occasionally had very bad days and nights. Tonight was one of them. Florence looked up and gave a pained smile when she saw him, holding out a hand. \"Papa.\" Her lips moved, but no sound came out. His heart breaking at her use of the nickname, Thomas moved across to the bed and sat down beside her, pulling her into his arms and cradling her. Lucille continued to stroke the child's hair, and after a moment it became clear that she had drifted off to sleep. \"She couldn't sleep without you,\" Lucille whispered. She sighed, her voice becoming genuinely pained. \"She is worsening, and still we cannot afford the medicine.\" Thomas sighed and rested his chin atop Florrie's head. \"Soon,\" he promised his sister. \"Then she can live and grow as a normal little girl.\" \"I don't think she could continue like this for much longer. She is older now,\" Lucille whispered. Thomas didn't reply, just looked down at the child and kissed her hair again, nestling his cheek against her head. After a moment, he bit his lip. \"I will not let her die. Of all things this world can take from me, it will never have her, \" he swore. Lucille watched him sorrowfully, then hardened her features and sighed sharply. \"I hope you mean that,\" she said darkly, leaning forward and kissing Florrie's forehead. Thomas refused to look at her as she stroked the child's hair once more and stood, placing the book on the bedside table and leaving the room. Thomas wasn't going anywhere. (Much happens between this and the next chapter that I have notes to write. In the meantime, I apologise for the jump.)[Chapter 4] Edith was horrified as she watched Lucille burn the pages of her novel. \"You killed her baby,\" she gasped. Lucille turned and glared at her. \"No I didn't.\" She turned and walked back to the dresser. \"None of them ever fucked Thomas. It was mine. It was born wrong.\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"We should have let it die at birth, but...\" She paused, and sighed heavily. \"I wanted it.\" There was a moment of quiet, then Lucille turned to face Edith, leaning against the bedpost. Her smile would have been touching if it wasn't for the woman wearing it. \"Thomas with a child,\" she said quietly, smiling a little at the memory. \"He's perfect.\" She glanced at Edith. \"It happened once before. I couldn't bear to break him like that, that's why we kept the first one.\" Edith's heart dropped as she realised what Lucille meant. \"Florrie...\" Lucille smiled then, genuine and proud. \"Florence Elle Sharpe. Heir to the Sharpe Mines and the legacy of Allerdale Hall. If I were only an aunt she'd be the honourable child of a talented engineer,\" she crooned. Edith was horrified. \"She's your...\" \"My daughter, yes. I must say, I thought you were brighter. It amazed me when none of the others noticed that she was far too young to have been born before her supposed Mother died, but then Thomas would have told them she was only a half sister.\" Lucille sighed and stepped forward. She picked out strands of Edith's hair and began to plait them as she crooned./p \"Thomas and I would do anything for that little girl. That's why he pours so much effort into his machine- if it worked, we could afford to send her to school. She could escape this life, this place. And we could afford to tend to the house, restore it to its former glory so that when she grows up and comes home she has something to be proud of...\" She was dreaming now, her eyes teary. Edith couldn't understand. \"But women have been tortured and killed in this house...\" Lucille glared at her. \"I kill for my child,\" she snapped. Edith recoiled. \"She is never usually allowed to spend time with her sisters-in-law, to become attached. The first one thought she was a ghost- she was only small. I wouldn't want her to be upset once they were dead. But you...\" Lucille tilted her head, her lips a thin line. She reached forward and traced a bony finger along Edith's jaw. \"Thomas has slipped up with you. He let you look after her, grow to love her. And the way she talks about you, oh, I don't doubt that she adores you too. You've stolen my little girl's love from me,\" she whispered dangerously. Edith sat rigid as she snipped off the plaited lock of hair with her scissors. A slow smile spread across Lucille's lips, scarier than ever. \"I'd better steal it back,\" she breathed darkly. Edith gasped, and felt the hot tears run down her face. Lucille turned and walked across to the dresser. \"(the grapple- a scene I'm working up to writing when I have plenty of time on my hands ^_^ ) As Thomas' body got heavier with his death, Lucille dropped him with a sob and screamed. At exactly this moment, Florrie stepped further into the room, where she'd stayed unnoticed after seeing Edith in the elevator. Thomas stirred weakly, and saw her. \"Florrie,\" he gasped, lifting his hand. The ghost of a grimace flitted across his lips, guilt stricken, and as Lucille turned around her face fell when she saw her daughter stood there. \"Florence, sweetheart...\" Lucille reached towards the child with bloody fingers, her expression one of agony. Florrie stumbled backwards away from her, eyes wide with terror. Realising the true damage she had done, Lucille let go of Thomas and ran from the room, screaming as she went. The clanging of the elevator as Edith fought to escape didn't register in Florrie's mind as she stared at her father's bloody form. Helpless, she cried out and dropped to her knees beside him. Thomas managed to wrap his arms around her and pull her to his chest, where he buried his lips in her hair. Florence cried into his shirt. \"She killed you,\" she choked out, gripping his shirt in her hands. Thomas sighed, too weak to speak. I...I'm sorry,\" he breathed. Florence looked up into his face and took it between her hands, careful to avoid the stab wound in his cheek. She frowned to mask the burning tears. \"Don't be sorry, Papa.\" Unable to ignore the image of Lucille covered in his blood, Florrie's breath stuck in her throat, and her eyes filled with tears. She stroked his face and touched her forehead to his. \"Edith will know that you love her,\" she promised him. She pecked his lips, the way she had always done since she was very small, and he smiled. Florrie gazed at him, frenzied, then had an idea. \"Haunt me ,\" she gasped, overcome with emotion. Thomas frowned at her, growing weaker again, and she stared at him. \"Haunt me, Papa! Haunt me, please ...\" she begged, crying freely. As Thomas smiled his last smile and looked into the eyes of his sister- his daughter- for the last time, he gave a tiny nod. He would try. \"My love is yours, Florence,\" he breathed. Florrie collapsed onto his chest, and cried. She gripped his shirt in both hands, felt his arms grow heavy and lifeless around her. She followed his every breath, as they slowed to nothing. His heart stuttered, then stopped, and she was left in the arms of a corpse, cold already because of the cold house they had always lived in. Edith gasped as Thomas' gruesome apparition slipped away from beneath her fingers. Whether he loved her or not, it no longer mattered, because he and his cruel sister were dead and Edith was leaving with Alan. She turned and tried to walk away, but remembered something else that seemed to hold her there. One key element that had made her life here even a little pleasant, at times. \"Florence,\" Edith whispered aloud. Eyes wide, she turned and stared at the house. The doctor shook his head. \"What? No! We must go...\" \"I can't leave her there, all alone. Having her family away in America is one thing, having them dead is another.\" \"Thomas and the Lady were monsters. What makes the youngest one any different?\" Alan insisted. Edith glared at him. \"Florence is ten years old . She never once frightened me, lied to me, hurt me. She is a good child who deserves a life, no matter what her parentage!\"[Chapter 5] Florrie lay there for what she thought was some time, refusing to look at her father's dead, hollow face. She was so wrapped up in grief for a father rather than a brother, that it took her a moment to realise that the new voice echoing from the main hall was calling her name. Lethargic, Florrie untangled herself from the body's arms and stood, dusting herself off without looking at him. At it. There was no Thomas in there any more, no Papa. As a second thought she leaned down and prised the ring off of his left finger, his wedding ring, and slipped it onto her own. She would never lose it. Still refusing to look at his ruined face, Florence turned and darted out of the room, moving towards the woman's voice. Florrie said nothing as she reached the staircase, relieved to see that it was Edith stood there. Remaining semi-hidden in the shadows, she called out in a clear, unwavering voice. \"Edith?\" \"Yes, sweetheart, it's me. Where are you?\" Florrie clenched her jaw, and went against all the rules her mother had ever told her to step out into plain view. Edith's face was a picture of relief when she saw her. \"Here,\" she said calmly. Edith smiled, teary eyed. Florrie slipped carefully down the stairs and stopped just short of her, tilting her head. She knew Edith could see the tear streaks that marked her face, and attempted to rub them away with her sleeve. Edith smiled sadly, and held out her hand. It shook with nerves. \"Come with me, Florence. Leave this place,\" she said quietly. Florrie stood perfectly still for a moment, and became aware of a shape in the corner behind Edith. As she looked closer, she saw that it was a ghost, and recognised Thomas's stature. Edith waited for an answer. \"Thomas wants me to take you,\" she whispered gently, looking at Florrie with apologetic eyes. Florrie didn't shift her gaze from her father's ghost over Edith's shoulder as she spoke. He nodded once. \"Lucille is dead too.\" Edith nodded shakily. Slowly, Florrie tilted her head to the other side, childish once more. \"You killed my Mama,\" she said quietly, eyes flicking back to Edith. Thomas' apparition seemed to tense as Edith looked down. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"I'm sorry...\" Florrie's eyes filled with tears and she wrung her hands, unable to look at the ghost again. \"But that's ok , because she... she killed my Papa,\" she stuttered in a shaky voice. Edith's eyes were wet too as she nodded. \"Yes.\" And then Florence ran forward and threw her arms around Edith, burying her face into her gown. \"He's dead ,\" she cried, the pain in her young voice breaking Edith's heart. Edith found her resolve and wrapped her arms tightly around the little girl. \"I know, honey. I'm sorry,\" she whispered. \"I promise I will look after you, I will love you as much as he did because I loved him and he loved you more than anything else in this world.\" Edith found herself growing frantic, and she leaned back to hold Florrie's face between her hands. The child watched her with those stunning green eyes. \"No, he loved you. He does. He wants you to live,\" she whispered. Edith frowned in confusion, and Florrie blinked through her tears, but her voice still broke. Edith found nothing to say, simply pulled Florence close and held her tightly as the little girl cried for her father. Her father, who had fallen in love with Edith, escaped his past, and so entrusted her with his most valuable possession. Edith was hit by a wave of emotion, and squeezed her eyes shut. She and Florrie stood there for a short while, imagining what life was to be like for them now.[Chapter 6] Edith rewrote her story in the months after her recovery. Though some specific memories of her ordeal were not pleasant, there were others that made her feel warm, sad even that there hadn't been more time. She had of course been married to a man who /had fallen in love with her, which had then freed him from the confines of his past. She had also been able to save the little girl that knew nothing of the world outside Allerdale Hall, and Crimson Peak. The new version of Edith's novel was focused on a little girl, whose father was a dark, troubled widower who loved his daughter very dearly. In the end, though not without complication, the father found love with a young woman and in turn found his daughtera new mother to look after her. Life took a better turn for these characters. This evening, as Edith finished typing up the manuscript at her desk, Florence was curled up on the settee under a blanket, fast asleep before the fire. Edith paused for a moment, and looked across at her. The poor child was constantly exhausted, and spent much of her time asleep on that settee. She was still very sick, but was getting better slowly now Edith had gotten her the medicine she needed, and had persuaded Alan to look after her, now that he was /more or less able again. At first he had been sour, resentful of the idea that any trace of the Sharpe siblings should be present in Edith's life, although over time he had realised that Florence was of course innocent, and that Edith loved her dearly. /Edith wasn't sure when she would get around to telling him the truth about the child's parentage, which could well have been the reason for her sickness in the first place. Edith sighed and finished typing the sentence she was on. She tidied her desk, then stood and moved across to Florence, crouching in front of her. She reached forward and stroked her hair. \"Florence?\" The little girl stirred, and opened her eyes just enough to see Edith's gentle smile. \"I'm going to bed now. Do you want to stay here?\" she whispered. Florence nodded weakly, her eyes shutting. Edith leaned forward and kissed her cheek. \"Alright. Goodnight, darling.\" Florence drifted out of consciousness quickly after Edith left the room. She still felt terrible, knowing that if she even tried to move she would most likely be reacquainted with her last meal. The young girl lay still for some time, unable to properly sleep but resting all the same, until she became aware of a slight depression in the blanket over her shoulder. Florrie's heartbeat quickened, and she fought to stay still, her rational mind a little cloudy as she tried to figure out what that could be. If felt very much like a hand. 1909 \"Miss Cushing, I really must insist that you do not venture back to that house.\" Dr McMichael glared at her, retaining his professionalism in the presence of others at the surgery but with his eyes clearly portraying his opinion as someone she'd known since childhood. \"Alan, it was my home. I can't forget that, as much as you might wish for me to,\" Florence replied steadily, watching him carefully. She knew he hated to admit it, but she was right. Still, the gentleman cleared his throat, glanced around the surgery and took her hand, pulling her into his office and shutting the door. \"My darling, you were trapped there for so long. A little girl with no children to play with, no interactions with the outside world. And not to mention your mother's practices...\" Florence pursed her lips, but did not let herself say what she wanted. \"It was not an unhappy childhood,\" she reminded him. The house was too big to ever feel trapped, anyway. And I had the ghosts. Alan simply sighed. \"Perhaps not from your point of view. But so much happened there, so much killing. Not to mention the terrible creature who birthed you, and that disloyal son of a...\" Florence soured instantly. \"Don't speak of them like that,\" she snapped. Her eyes were dangerous, just like Lucille's had been, and Alan checked himself, ashamed that he'd let himself get carried away again. \"Florrie, I'm sorry, I just...\" Florence was already reaching for the door as his face fell with guilt. \"You loved them, I know. You were an innocent little girl.\" The young woman refused to look at him as she undid the bolt on the door and pulled it open. \"My father loved Edith. He died saving her, and you will do well to remember that. As for the house, I grew up there. As much as I enjoy living here with Edith and yourself, the Hall will always be a part of who I am,\" she answered calmly, and left. Alan rubbed his face with his hands, and stepped to the doorway. He really wasn't very good at parenting, or to be more accurate, being a guardian. When he looked down the corridor, Florence had vanished. Old habits die hard , Alan chuckled to himself. \"Florence, darling, what is it? You look like you've seen a ghost,\" Edith said brightly, enjoying her own little joke. As she poured tea, Florence bit her lip. \"That's the thing,\" she said softly. \"I haven't, not in a while.\" Edith paused. She knew what this meant to Florence, and wasn't sure she wanted to pursue it. It was a moment before her hand moved to the sugar lumps- she'd become rather fond of the sweetness after living in the Hall. \"He hasn't been to visit you?\" she asked quietly, watching her stepdaughter carefully. Florence shook her head slightly, lips pursed. \"Not since your anniversary,\" she whispered. Edith sighed a little and set down the teaspoon. \"Oh, darling, you know our anniversary is difficult for him. Perhaps he's just taking a little time to himself- he spends much more time in our world than most spirit people do,\" she suggested calmly, hoping this would put her daughter at ease. She would do anything for Florence, as she had done for the past eight years, and loved her dearly, but she couldn't afford to revisit their past. That would be far too dangerous, and inspire a lot of pain. Florence knew this, and she respected Edith's wishes. But she just missed her father so much. Even after all these years, she slept much better when she could feel him in the room with her, and she talked to him all the time under her breath. noshade=\"\" I think eventually there will be more about Edith and Florence, I keep having ideas ^_^) Thank you for reading![Chapter 7] So I had this brainwave a while back, and decided to just write it. This is an alternative ending to the story of Crimson Peak with the little girl in it, that continues from Edith's escape. You promised you wouldn't fall in love with anyone else!\" \"Yes, but it happened .\" Lucille paused, horror clouding her face, then clawed at him with a sob and plunged her knife deep into the hollow beneath his collar bone. As Thomas staggered back to the wall, eyes wide with the pain, Lucille drew the knife out to go at him again. Shewas overtaken by rage, and heartbreak, but still could not see that she was not thinking straight. \" Mummy! Stop it! \" Lucille froze again as a broken scream cut through the air. She blinked rapidly, out of her trance, and stared as Thomas looked into her eyes with some weak hint of warning. \"Florrie,\" he gasped. The ghost of a grimace flitted across his lips, guilt stricken, and as Lucille turned around her face fell when she saw her daughter stood in the doorway, trembling. \"Florence, sweetheart...\" Lucille reached towards the child with bloody fingers, her expression one of agony. Florrie stumbled away from her, eyes wide with terror. \"Papa?\" \" Run, Florence.\" Realising the true damage she had done, Lucille let go of Thomas and staggered backwards herself, before the rage overtook her again and she reached out and grabbed Florence by the waist as she listened to her father and tried to run away. \"No! You betrayed me! You neglected your ownmother for the stupid woman your father married!\" Lucille wailed as she tightened her arms around her daughter, locking her still and pressing her cheek to her ear. Florencepanicked, and struggled, crying now, having seen her father choking and fighting to stay conscious from the pain on the floor. She continued to cry, repeating \"please, mama\" over and over, but her mother took no heed, blinded by rage that was, really,aimed at Edith. Lucille snarled and spun the child around to face her, then took her by the throat and pinned her down on the bed, a strange mixture of guilt and passion coursing through her veins. \"I love you, my darling,\" she crooned as Florrie kicked at her and tried to peel her hands away. \"I will always love you, everything I've ever done is to protect you. A mother's love is unparalleled in this world...\" At this second, as Florrie began to weaken and her legs stopped kicking, Thomas grimaced as he forced himself to stand, and could see just enough to notice Edith appear in the doorway. \"If you love her so much, let go of her,\" the young woman warned, her voice even despite her clear terror. Lucille turned to glare at her, but she clenched her jaw. In that moment Edith was both relieved that she'd stopped Lucille suffocating her daughterand horrified that she'd caught the murdering psychopath's attention. Edith had just enough time to turn and sprint to the elevator before Lucille had thrown Florence with force at the dresser and tore out of the room after her, screaming as she went. Florence's small body hit the dresser with a crack, and slid to the groundwith a light thud. The clanging of the elevator as Edith fought to escape didn't register in Thomas' mind as he stumbled across the room to where Florence had landed in a heap. She was unconscious, but breathing, so he put a hand on her cheek and tried to rouse her, hisown fear making him tremble. Lucille had made a good job of strangling her. He could lose everything he had, but please, God, not his little girl. \"Florence? Please come back to me, sweetheart... We'll get out of here, I promise...\" After a moment or two, the child stirred, and her eyes flew open as she spluttered and coughed and realised what had happened. She relaxed when she saw that her father had her, but whimpered. \"Daddy, it hurts,\" she croaked, breaking Thomas' heart. He nodded, and stroked her face, noticing how she'd hit the corner of the dresser, and she really wasn't lying straight. \"I know, love. Be brave,\" he whispered. Little Florrie nodded and bit her lip. Taking a deep breath, Thomas scooped the little girl up into his arms and clenched his teeth against her whimpers and the pain in his chest as he forced himself to stand. Thewhole process took him far longer than he'd have liked, but he was out and in the hallway just as the elevator came back up empty. \"We don't stop until you kill me, or I kill you!\" Edith held her ground, brandishing the shovel, as Lucille continued to scream at her. The blizzard was so thick now that she could see nothing around her, but she was certain she could make out a shape staggering towards them from the house. \" I said don't touch her, Lucille! \" Thomas snarled, furious. Edith's heart leapt with relief at hearing his voice. Lucille's eyes widened, and she turned to face him, her expression pained. \"But Thomas...\" Thomas simply glared at her, his expression terrifying as he loomed over her. He had Florence on his left hip, held tightly against his side, her arms around his neck and her face buried in his shoulder against the cold. Lucille seemed to cower away ashe gritted his teeth. \" Enough! I am in love with Edith , and I will protect her. You were only ever my sister , and to my discredit I let you corrupt my mind. We are finished ,\" he growled. Lucille saw the fire in his eyesand recoiled, hesitated, then turned her gaze on Edith. Her sudden calm was deeply unsettling as she glided towards her. \"Either you kill me, or I kill you,\" she whispered, utterly crazed. There was a moment of stillness, and Edith could swear she saw regret in those eyes. But it was too late now. Before Thomas could do anything but turn Florence away, Lucille screamedand lunged at Edith. In pure terror, Edith frantically swung the spade, and hit her smack across the jaw. Lucille collapsed to the ground, having been killed instantly. Edith was strangely glad she had not suffered, for the sake of the child. \"I heard you the first time,\" she muttered. She gasped at the air, dropping the spade and finding herself hysterical. She did not struggle as Thomas ran forward to catch her, wrapping her tightly in his other arm. He had jumped right over the body of his sister. \"Edith, darling, I'm sorry for everything. So sorry...\" he mumbled, frenzied. Edith simply concentrated on breathing, clutching at his bloodied shirt as she allowed him to hug her close to him, rubbing her arm for warmth. She figured that her allowinghim to touch her would show him she accepted his apology.[Chapter 8] Thomas let neither Edith nor Florence out of his sight for the next three weeks. He had the workers gather what could be salvaged from the house, and pack it into boxes. It turned out all he wanted to keep were clothes, perhaps a few books from the library, his mechanics, keepsakes from his and Florrie's once innocent childhood. Everythingelse was a part of the past that he was only too glad to be rid of. While the men worked, the three stayed in the warm little room beneath the Post Office, where Thomas and Edith had once spent the night together. Edith's friend the Doctor, Alan, had been taken to hospital, where he was being treated for his wounds. Inthe meantime Thomas had asked him for strict instructions on caring for both Florence and Edith and making their recovery as comfortable as possible. Florence had broken ribs and muscle damage in her neck, which bruised horribly, whilst Edith hadescaped with a few scrapes and was mostly in shock. Thomas refused to leave their bedside for anything, and carefully cleaned and bandaged wounds when required. He mixed medicine as Edith watched and, rather than force his wife into his company, slept in the armchair in the corner of the room, despitehis discomfort. Edith could see that he was racked with guilt over the entire occurrence, and in agony from his own stab wound, but he did not complain. One night, after about a week, she awoke to find him sat reading what remained of her novel by candlelight. Checking that Florrie was breathing easily beside her, Edith watched him for a moment, seeing the tears in his eyes as the memories plagued himagain. It took much effort for Edith to move her hand from where it was tucked under Florrie's shoulder with her arm around her, but she stretched it out towards him and tried to whisper. \"Thomas,\" she gasped. He looked up suddenly, startled. His face was a picture of sorrow, and Edith felt her heart break. She didn't want him to suffer. \"Lie with us,\" she breathed, her voice breaking. Something flickered in Thomas' face, perhaps relief, or hope. He slowly set down the manuscript and stood up, moving hesitantly across to the bed. Edith was on her side, with Florence curled up in front of her, so out of respect Thomas lay down behind her with space between them and simply placed a hand on her shoulder. He was afraid to upset her, but Edith wanted him to know it wasok. She reached and lifted his hand from her shoulder, then pulled it around her waist so he could feel Florrie's hands too. Hesitantly, gingerly, Thomas shuffled a little closer and pulled her to him. Edith smiled as she stroked his hand with a finger andfelt his breath in her hair. \"It's ok,\" she breathed weakly. At the movement in the bed, Florence stirred, and Thomas felt her little fingers weave through his as she noticed his presence. He couldn't help his smile as her weak voice floated through the darkness. \"Edith?\" \"Yes, sweetheart?\" Florrie paused for a moment, and Edith heard her biting her lip. \"Will you be my new mama?\" she asked quietly, nervously. Edith smiled to herself, and heard Thomas hold his breath. She moved her lips to Florence's hair and kissed it softly. \"Of course I will,\" she whispered passionately. \"I'll never leave you, I promise.\" Thomas exhaled behind her, and Edith could practically feel his relief. Tomorrow, they were leaving, going back to America at first, to start their new life together. To live as a normal family- husband, wife, and daughter. Thomas and Florence never did weep for Lucille. At least, they never mourned in front of Edith. As twisted and evil as she was, she was still Thomas' sister and Florence's mother. She'd protected and cared for them both as children. In a strange contrast, Edith found it relatively simple to pass for Florence's mother. The fact she was wise beyond her years drew credit to the notion that she and Thomas were simply childhood sweethearts who had eventually settled down together. Neitherof them really looked old enough to have a ten year old child, but they were so happy together and Florence was clearly so loved and cared for that nobody ever stopped to pry. They'd bought a small house with a patch of land out in the most rural village they could find outside London, where Edith wrote her stories and Thomas rebuilt his workshop in the attic. Before the tragedy of Allerdale Hall, he'd actually got his machineto work, and so wasted no time in posting copies of his now completed plans and proposals to various companies all through the country. He was starting to find success. While her husband worked at the final stages of building a career that would sustain them for the rest of their lives, Edith focused almost all of her attention on Florence's education. As the little girl had never seen much of the great outdoors andmost certainly had never travelled beyond the gates of their own estate, Edith knew that to send her straight to a public school would be terribly cruel. The poor child had never been allowed to interact with other people as a general rule, let alonemeet someone her age, so Edith knew she would have to take small, carefully measured steps to give Florence the best chance at continuing her education with other children at school. Admittedly, Lucille had done an excellent job of home schooling Florence at the hall, and she had no problems with anything academic. By any standards she was a bright girl, and this gave Edith hope that with time she would be able to pick up whateverwas being learned in class with no issues. In an attempt to tackle Florence's distrust of the outside world, Edith took her 'daughter' out almost every day, to parks and libraries and other small towns besides their own. At first Florence had been terribly afraid of these experiences, and clutchedat Edith's hand with a desperate grip, but with time she had learned that other people were not as bad as Lucille always told her, and that in fact one's life could be enriched by forming friendships with others outside of their home and family. Every day when they returned home she would run up to the attic, where Thomas would ask her what she'd learned that day, and she would launch into a bright description of even the most usual of interactions. Thomas took great joy in watching her progression,and frequently told Edith how wonderful she was and how Florence would grow up to be a better person thanks to her. At the present moment, Edith was sat on the sofa in the living room of their new home, a very sleepy Florence curled up in her arms as she waited for her father to prepare her medicine. Thomas knelt before them, humming softly as he mixed and measuredout the dose, dripping it into a syringe with the utmost precision. Edith rubbed Florrie's arm encouragingly- the little girl hated injections. She much preferred it when Thomas administered her doses to when Alan did, but it didn't make the sensation of the needle in her arm any less uncomfortable. Dr McMichael had recentlysuggested she be swapped from pills to jabs to allow the drug to take action through her bloodstream faster, and of course Thomas and Edith had agreed. All they wanted was for Florence to be healthy. Thomas finished preparing the needle, and glanced guiltily at Edith, who smiled. \"Okay, darling, are you ready?\" Florence opened her eyes at the sound of his voice, and though her brow furrowed and she bit her lip, she nodded, clutching Edith's arm tightly. Thomas smiled softly. \"Good girl. Give me your hand.\" Obediently, Florence stretched out an arm and closed her fingers around her father's outstretched palm. She watched him gingerly as he wiped the crook of her elbow clean, his eyes flicking to hers for a moment as he readied the needle. \"One, two... three,\" Thomas counted gently as he gave her the jab and took the syringe away, rubbing his daughter's arm carefully. Edith smiled as Florrie exhaled shakily. \"You're very brave,\" she told her, meeting her eyes. Thomas nodded. \"That you are. Dr McMichael will be very pleased.\" I love this version, and I think I'll continue to write it along with the other one :3 please let me know what you think!

Shoutout to LumosMoonstone for being so amazing and listening to all my ideas! Enjoy! xoxo Valerie QUINN GRAY'S POV: The bathroom door shook under Dean's fist, the noise tensing every muscle in my body. Leaning over the sink, I glared at my reflection and turned on the tap. \"Quit it!\" I hissed. \"I'm coming – give it a break!\" The pounding stopped and Dean's footsteps disappeared down the corridor. Leave it to my brother to be an ass , I thought. Cupping my hands together, I sank my face into cold water. When I looked up in the mirror again, I grimaced. There were prominent dark circles under my eyes, circles that had accumulated over a long period of restless nights. I shut off the tap and walked out of the bathroom. Dean was waiting for me in the kitchen, putting a jug of milk back in the fridge. He grabbed the two bowls sitting on the counter and walked out to the living room. \"Can you grab the spoons?\" he called out over his shoulder. Reluctantly, I did. He carefully lowered himself on the couch and handed me a bowl. I sat on the floor beside the coffee table and started eating almost mournfully. \"So, Quinnie —\" \"Don't call me that.\" Dean snickered. \"You used to love it.\" \"It's been twelve years. Preferences do change, you know.\" He fell silent for a while. I reached for the remote and clicked on the TV. Flipping through channels, I settled on watching the weather forecast for that week. As expected, there would be nothing but sunshine and more sunshine. \"Gotta love California weather,\" I muttered. \"Don't know why the hell you ran away here out of all places.\" Dean scoffed in reply. He continued eating, suddenly looking very interested in his cereal. I had every right to be passive-aggressive. For twelve years, I'd heard nothing from him, not one phone-call, not one letter. And now, because of \"the accident\", I was sentenced to live with him until I turned eighteen. As if moving from the Oregon house I grew up in to the land of beaches and fame wasn't enough, I had to spend nine whole goddamn months with a brother who felt more like a stranger than family. \"So,\" I said, finishing up the last bit of milk, \"I'm going to need to borrow your car.\" \"What for?\" Dean asked, frowning. \"I want to go out. If I'm starting at West Valley High next week, I need to get started on the whole making friends thing.\" He gave me a sly smile. \"I already took care of that for you,\" he informed me. My face fell. \"What?\" \"Yeah, I found a great place where you can make tons of friends.\" Narrowing my eyes, I got up. \"Dean,\" I began, fighting the urge to raise my voice. \"Dean, don't get involved in my life, alright? I don't need your help. I've been doing just fine without you for the past—\" \"Yeah, I know,\" he said, irritated. \"You've reminded me over a hundred times since you got here. I get it – you're independent.\" He got up as well, and though I straightened my posture as much as I could, he towered over me. \"But as long as I am your legal guardian, I'm also allowed to make choices for you.\" The tension around us was so thick you could've cut it with a knife. It took every ounce of strength in my body to not reach out and slap him. Legal guardian, my ass. \"Get changed and meet me outside in fifteen minutes,\" Dean said. He grabbed my bowl and his and headed into the kitchen, unaware of the glares I was giving him. Fifteen minutes later, Dean pulled out of the driveway in a red '73 Ford Thunderbird. For all it was worth, at least he had good taste in cars – although, I wouldn't admit that to his face even if it killed me. He drove down the streets of Encino with the windows rolled down, while Bruce Springsteen sang softly on the radio. I glanced at Dean out of the corner of my eye, lips pursed tightly in dismay. Though he was my brother, he looked almost nothing like me. He had relatively dark hair while mine was the colour of caramel, and his skin was wintry and pale while mine was sun-kissed like any other typical California girl's. The only aspect that was the same were his eyes – hazel with green flecks. On him, they looked good – mysterious, even. On me, not so much. \"Do I have something on my face?\" he suddenly asked. I snapped my gaze away, folding my arms across my chest. \"Yeah, a dash of ugly. I think it's permanent.\" \"Ha. Very funny.\" After what seemed like an eternity, he parked in front of a building with a giant cobra painted on the front. My eyes widened. \" Karate – strike like a Cobra Kai ,\" I read aloud. A cold tingle slid down my spine. \"Dean, you didn't.\" He laughed. \"I did. You're welcome.\" He was out of the car before I could maim him. I had no choice but to follow him. I mentally swore at Dean every way I knew how, even ways I didn't. It must've been almost two years since I'd stopped training, and that was because my old karate dojo back in Oregon got renovated into a hair salon before I could get my black belt. I'd lost interest in the sport afterwards; it was nothing spectacular if you weren't the best at it. Having only a purple belt didn't exactly give me bragging rights the way brown belts and black belts did. \"How did you know I did karate?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Mom and Dad told me,\" Dean replied, opening the door for me. His words made my stomach sink. He'd talked to our parents since he'd left and he never once bothered to talk to me . That was even more reason to kick his ass. I walked inside. The air conditioning was on at probably the lowest setting, but it still felt much better than the stuffy heat outside. I craned my head to get a better look of the place; there were photos on the wall of a man I assumed to be the sensei, including a life-size cut-out of him in a striking position. Well, he's arrogant , I thought. The plaque below a photo of him in an army uniform read Cpt. John Kreese . Trophies decorated the foyer of the dojo, probably from the numerous competitions his students had participated in. At least his dojo had a good reputation. But the main attraction were the sixteen teenage boys lined up in a perfect square, practicing tornado kicks in synchronization. A tall and well-built man in a black sleeveless gi patrolled around the boys with a glare that could rival mine. His sharp, cold eyes assessed them individually. When his gaze fell on Dean and me, it was like the blood in my veins stopped flowing. Shit, I thought. I'm toast . The boys all stopped abruptly, assuming their resting positions – arms slightly bent at the elbow in front of their abdomen – and waited for Kreese's instructions. \"Class, we have two visitors,\" the sensei said, his austere voice resounding throughout the dojo. \"Fall in.\" They all straightened themselves up and turned to face us; two boys in the front row traded places with two other boys behind them. They all seemed to stare at Dean and I like predators – the way a snake eyes its next meal. When I looked up at Dean, his face was emotionless and calm, and he betrayed no sign of having been intimidated. I hated how I was the only one affected by the tension in the room. He could've at least tried to sympathize with me. \"Hello, Kreese,\" Dean greeted. \"Gray,\" Sensei Kreese replied in the same uninterested voice. \"Is this the little vermin?\" he asked, inclining his head in my direction. Vermin ? What the hell— \"Yes,\" my brother answered, sliding over that comment. \"She's a purple belt already.\" I narrowed my eyes at him. If looks could kill, I'd be on death row already. \"What style?\" \"Shotokan.\" The corners of Kreese's mouth curled upwards. \"Then she's not completely untrained.\" I could tell he and I weren't going to ever get along. The amount of disrespect he had for his students – existent and potential – was sickening. A boy from the front row snickered. He had light blonde hair and a black headband tied around his forehead, and in all honesty, he was the most attractive guy in the dojo. But he, too, had contracted Kreese's lack of respect, which made whatever physical attraction I might have felt for him meaningless. He gave the other boys beside him a look that said it all – what a loser . \"Mr. Lawrence!\" Kreese called out. The blond boy with the headband straightened up. \"Yes, sensei!\" \"Feel like matching Ms. Gray?\" \" Yes, sensei! \" It was like someone had hit me upside the head with a baseball bat. \"What? No – I can't fight now —\" \"On the mat,\" Kreese ordered. Panicked, I looked to Dean for help, but the bastard was too busy trying to fight back a smile to make any attempt at getting me out of sparring. Exhaling shakily, I took off my shoes and jacket, and stepped onto the soft white mat. The boys parted themselves, forming a rectangle around the fight zone. Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic , I chanted. It didn't help at all. \"Go Johnny!\" one of the blonde's friends yelled. Johnny Lawrence . It would have been a cute name if it hadn't belonged to someone who looked like he could pulverize me in two seconds flat. I knew the routine. Both Johnny and I bowed to Kreese and then turned and bowed to each other. I assumed a back stance, ready to block anything Johnny was about to throw at me. He looked confident, smirking with a murderous glint in his eye, while I was almost shaking with fear. Once upon a time, I used to be alright with handling pain. Now, even a paper cut managed to cripple me. I couldn't bear to imagine what a kick in the face from him would feel like. \"Begin!\" Kreese shouted. The reckless part of my brain told me to strike first. So I did. And he dodged it. Except Johnny didn't just dodge it. He grabbed my arm and snuck in a roundhouse kick, hitting me straight in the chest. I landed on the floor, gasping for air. Tears swam in my eyes, threatening to stain my cheeks and humiliate me even further. Boys snickered left and right, making my face burn with anger. Gritting my teeth, I kipped-up and got back into my stance. \"C'mon, Johnny!\" another boy shouted. Johnny didn't look pleased. Obviously, he'd planned for his kick to be final; I wasn't supposed to get up. He lunged towards me and threw a punch. In the second it took for me to block it, he let his guard down. I didn't waste that second. I punched him in the chest, making him wince and coil back. He rubbed the spot where I'd hit him, never breaking eye contact. He tensed like an animal about to strike. For a second, I'd been so damn proud of myself for landing a blow on him, but really, all that did was piss him off even more. Great , I thought. I'm gonna get it now. I saw him spin into a tornado kick, and I saw his foot coming towards my face, but by the time I'd registered that I was about to get hit, it was too late. The only thing I could think of as I landed face first on the mat was how pretty his eyes were – a bright blue the colour of the sea. My left cheek stung so badly that my vision turned white. A pathetic whimper escaped me; it took everything I had to not cry. Forget the pain , I told myself. Make Johnny feel it instead. \"Are you done?\" Johnny taunted. \"Or do you want more?\" He made the mistake of stepping too close to me. I swung out my legs and kicked his from under him. Before he could react, I crawled over him and punched him as hard as I could in the jaw. As I tried to get another hit in, he threw me off him. His friends were no longer laughing. It was my turn to smile. Though my moment of victory didn't last long. As soon as we were both back up on our feet, Johnny attacked again, and like before, I wasn't able to react fast enough to dodge his fist. My nose burned, and I felt a warm liquid dripping down onto my lips. I wiped at it with my hand. Don't give up , I thought. Don't let him see you cry. It was bad form to kick someone when they're down, but Johnny didn't seem to mind. He got me right in the stomach, flipping me over on my back. Why wasn't Kreese calling the fight off already? Surely, we'd broken so many rules in this sparring match. Was he that sadistic? Or was he just waiting for me to give up? But I couldn't do that. I'd never do that. As I stumbled onto my feet, Johnny spun around into the worst kick yet. I hit the mat on my back, trying to remember how breathing worked. Please, stop the match . Suddenly, I began to cough violently, and with every muscle contraction in my abdomen, a new wave of pain spread through my body. I made the mistake of looking up at Dean – his eyes were wide in what looked like concern. Must've been a better actor than I thought. He was probably horrified at the thought of the medical bill that would follow if Johnny did any real damage. Bastard. After a few more seconds, I mustered up the strength to stand up and get back in my stance. The blood from my nose dripped into my mouth and down my chin, staining the white mat. Johnny wasn't smiling anymore. Neither were his friends. Instead, he glanced at his sensei, and a sinister smile spread across Kreese's face as he rested his hands on his karate belt. \"You're an incessant little vermin, ain't ya?\" he asked. \"I like that.\" He straightened up and his smile vanished. \"Tomorrow morning at eight a.m., I expect to see you here for your first lesson.\" It was like heaven was looking down on me. I let out a shaky breath in relief. \"So she can get her ass kicked again?\" one of Johnny's friends whispered. They began to snicker but Kreese shot them a cold look that made them stop like at the flick of a switch. I reluctantly bowed at Johnny and then at Kreese. Kreese turned to Dean and they began talking, probably about the cost of each lesson. I tried to stand up straight – and stopped immediately when my back and chest ached in complaint. Painfully, I put my shoes back on and grabbed my jacket. When I looked at Johnny one more time, I noticed his smirk was back. He stood beside his four friends who had laughed hard on my part only a few seconds ago. I huffed quietly and left while my brother was preoccupied with Kreese, trying to put as much distance between myself and the dojo before Dean realized I was gone.[Chapter 2] QUINN GRAY'S POV: When I was sure Dean hadn't followed me, I sat down on the edge of the sidewalk and inhaled deeply. My chest ached in complaint, scolding me for breathing. Like I have a choice , I thought. What had I gotten myself into? I was sure that if I'd put up more of a struggle in the car, Dean wouldn't have forced me to go through with the karate lessons. But now, I was stuck with a bunch of cruel assholes – mildly good-looking assholes – who could beat me up seven ways from Sunday anytime they pleased. Though, I couldn't blame Dean for everything. The truth was that it felt good to be a part of something so united again. The white gi, the belt, the same fierce cobra on the back – everyone in there was a team. Even back in Oregon, my old karate friends were more of a family to me than my real one. I could already see the appeal of being one of Kreese's students. And I was sure that if I gave it time, I'd grow used to being sadistic and merciless like him and the rest of his boys. Part of me didn't really mind that, and it scared me. I didn't really feel like going home and dealing with Dean yet, so I hitched a cab and decided to roam around LA instead. The cab driver gawked at me when he first saw me, and I could tell he was very close to calling the police on my behalf, but I pulled my hood up and slouched in the backseat and asked him to take me somewhere \"fun\". He proceeded to drop me off at Golf 'N Stuff. Dean had told me about the place back when I'd first arrived in California, though I hadn't paid much attention to it. I wasn't big on amusement parks. Things like bumper cars and trampolines and stupid games where you had to throw a ball and knock down as many pins as possible didn't appeal to me. The only thing I was okay with were rollercoasters, but even those got tiring after a while. There were a lot of couples at Golf 'N Stuff when I arrived. I didn't know how they could ever find a place like that acceptable for a date. That stuff seemed a lot more suitable for people who were just friends . It wasn't romantic at all. I made a beeline for the closest bathroom. There were a few girls already inside, so I waited as inconspicuously as possible until they were gone to take my jacket off. When I did, my stomach did a flip. There was dried blood spattered on my nose and chin, and I was already forming a black eye. I frantically wetted some paper towels and dabbed at the stains. When everything was cleaned up, the only real damage was a reddened nose – not broken, thank God – and the eye that I was fighting hard to keep open. \"It's fine,\" I said out loud. \"You'll be fine.\" Though it hurt to breathe, after running careful fingers across my ribs and wincing under my touch, I realized that none were broken. I tried to straighten my posture as much as I could, and giving myself one last look in the mirror, I walked out of the bathroom. I ignored the looks I got from everyone that passed me. The bruises on my face were just indications that I wasn't afraid to fight them. Let them stare. Even though I couldn't beat Johnny, I was sure that I could beat everyone else – anyone else. Hell, even his stupid friends would be dead meat if I ever had to fight them. Who cared about strangers staring? Let them stare . And if they stare too long, I'll kick their faces in. I scolded myself for thinking that. I was angry, that was all. There wasn't any need for me to turn into a bully like Kreese. It shouldn't make me happy to think about hurting others. But it did. I wanted to take out my anger on someone – no, not someone . Dean. That bastard. He was the reason why my eye was swelling shut and my nose stung every time I breathed, and why it felt like I was being stabbed repeatedly in the chest whenever I moved. I wanted to punch him into next year and let him feel how I felt. I retreated into the nearby Arcade. It was intimidating – so many games and not enough time to play them all – but my eyes fixed themselves on the ice hockey table. There were already two boys getting ready to play, but the moment I stepped into view and smiled – painfully – their faces lit up. \"D'you mind if I join?\" I asked. It was pathetically obvious that they were staring at my eye, but at least they had the decency not to mention it. The stockier of the boys nodded at me. \"Sure, let's see what you've got.\" It didn't take long for me to beat him. Maybe I was good, maybe he was going easy on me, I didn't care. It felt a lot less thrilling to win than I thought it would. \"Nice moves,\" the boy said. He held his hand out after the match. \"Freddy Fernandez.\" \"Quinn Gray.\" I shook it. \"This is Alan,\" he introduced the boy beside him. Alan wore a red bandanna, halfway lost in his curly hair. Tacky, but it suited him. He held out his hand, too. \"You guys go to school around here?\" I asked. \"Yeah, West Valley,\" Freddy replied. \"Cool. Me, too.\" Or at least, that's what Dean had told me. I wondered if I'd gotten the name wrong. \"I haven't seen you at school before,\" Freddy says. We'd started to move away from the table hockey and onto shooting hoops. He tossed a ball and missed. \"I'm new,\" I said. It left a sour taste in my mouth. \"I just moved here from Oregon.\" \"Wow. What was it like?\" \"I don't know. Nice?\" My aversion towards the subject made him drop it altogether. I picked up a ball and threw it at the hoop. It went in, all net and no rim. Freddy's eyes widened. \"You play a lot?\" \"Not really.\" We walked around the Arcade for a while, trying out different games. It was the perfect distraction, or was until Freddy cleared his throat. \"So, I've been meaning to ask but I didn't want to seem rude. What happened to your eye?\" Alan inched forward. He, too, was curious. Defeated, I sighed. \"Do you want the short version or the long version?\" \"Short version,\" Freddy decided. \"I got into a fight.\" Both boys looked at me expectantly like they were waiting for the next part of the story, but I pursed my lips and headed for a Pac-Man machine in the back. \"That's all we get?\" Alan pushed. \"You guys said you wanted the short version.\" \"C'mon, spill,\" Freddy urged. \"What happened?\" I ended up leading them outside. We walked around the grounds while I talked. I didn't tell them much – just that I used to do karate back in Salem and that my brother thought it would be good for me to get back into it, and that I was forced to spar by my soon-to-be sensei even though it had been almost two years since I'd done anything that physically demanding. \"That's so cool!\" Alan's eyes twinkled. \"What dojo are you training at?\" \"The Cobra Kai dojo.\" My voice seethed with venom. The boys didn't notice. They started getting excited and telling me all kinds of stories about how amazing that dojo was and how impressive the students were. I tried to tune them out, occasionally humming in agreement. It was only when they brought up the subject of Johnny Lawrence that I started to pay attention again. \"Yeah, I know him,\" I said. \"I fought him.\" This cued another barrage of questions and observations that I wasn't too fond of. Did he kick your ass? He's Kreese's favourite student, you can't stand a chance. Johnny's a two-time champion – did you ever compete before? Of course, Alan and Freddy hadn't sounded that scornful and maybe I was extrapolating a little, but the message was crystal clear – Johnny Lawrence was a threat. \"Whatever,\" I said. \"It doesn't matter.\" \"But it does!\" Freddy exclaimed. \"You're, like, the first girl to be a Cobra Kai. Ever .\" \"Huh.\" Alan raised an eyebrow. \"You're telling us you don't care at all? About any of this?\" \"I really don't.\" Liar . \"I'm just doing this because my brother's paying for the lessons.\" Though that was one of the reasons, I didn't dare tell them the whole truth. I couldn't admit how deep Johnny Lawrence had burrowed himself under my skin over the past few hours, or how humiliated I felt when everyone in that dojo – including my brother – was rooting against me. Freddy and Alan were both unconvinced, but they strayed from the topic. \"Anyways, we're having a beach party in a few days,\" Freddy said. \"You should come.\" \"Sure.\" \"Cool.\" It was easy to hang out with them when they weren't talking about how cool Johnny Lawrence was. I found myself enjoying their company; they weren't all that different from my old friends in Salem, which was comforting. As Freddy and Alan continued to show off, I even found myself smiling. California was starting to look slightly less horrible than before. I know this is super late, but better late than never, right? Thank you so much for everyone that read the first part and reviewed it. Hopefully I'll be more consistent with updates in the future![Chapter 3] QUINN GRAY'S POV: Of course, I got the third-degree when I got home. Dean was so pissed – where were you? – who were you with? – do you not realize you could have gotten lost? – quit rolling your eyes at me when I'm talking to you – I let him pretend to be authoritarian and locked myself in my sorry excuse of a room as soon as he was finished. Dean was honestly the very last thing on my mind. I was far more concerned about the beach party I'd been invited to. Call me fickle, but it isn't everyday boys decide they want to hang out with me. Besides, it was a perfect distraction. Beach parties were fun and stress-free – and exactly what I needed. I spent the rest of the evening unpacking the last few boxes I'd neglected, softly humming along to the radio. Halfway through a song I didn't recognize, Dean knocked on my door to tell me dinner was ready. I politely declined. But unpacking was a job that only kept my hands busy, and I soon found myself thinking about that morning. It didn't take long for it to sink in that I hated that dojo and everyone in it. My skin crawled at the thought of going back, which was exactly what I was going to have to do. And it wasn't even because Dean was so adamantly paying for my lessons. No, I needed to gain back the respect I'd lost. Though, really, the more I thought about it, it didn't feel like I'd had any in the first place. And goddamn – those eyes ! Who gave Johnny Lawrence the right to have such pretty eyes? So cold and twisted and cruel and sickeningly beautiful; it was like the guy upstairs had taken it upon himself to make sure I would always suffer here. Maybe there was something messed up with me for calling the guy that beat me up beautiful. Maybe I was going insane already. After a long shower, I peeled off my damp towel and slipped into bed. The fabric was cool against my skin, perfect for the stuffy weather. Despite my brain's natural tendency to overthink everything as soon as the lights were off, I fell asleep in a heartbeat. I left the house at seven. Dean had offered to drive me there but I refused. I didn't need him to think that I couldn't get by without his help. Besides, I was nervous enough as it was about being back in that dojo. I didn't need Dean breathing down my neck, too. But the one downside of walking was that my mind was free to roam as it pleased, even into territories I wanted to leave untouched. Last night was horrible. Though I'd fallen asleep peacefully, I'd woken up a few times with his blue eyes seared into the back of my lids. Johnny Lawrence – even his name sounded pretty. It fit him like an old pair of gloves. I sounded like such a girl . Getting worked up over a boy was something I swore I'd never do, and here I was, shallowly thinking about how attractive the guy that kicked my ass was. There really was something wrong with me. I reached the dojo with a few minutes to spare. Kreese had gotten everything ready for me – he motioned to a white karate-gi on the bench in front of the foyer. \"Changing rooms are at the back,\" he said. I bowed slightly and grabbed the gi. The changing rooms turned out to be one changing room, clearly meant for boys only. I was suddenly very grateful that I was the only one there. I should have taken Freddy's comment about me being the first female Cobra Kai a little more seriously. Dressing and undressing around a bunch of teenage boys was going to be difficult. I moved fast. I'd put on a gi more times than I could count; despite not doing any karate for almost two years, it felt nice to be back in the routine. As I got my belt out of my bag, boys started to loudly pile in. It wasn't until I had almost gotten it tied around my waist that I heard them . \"Look what the cat dragged in,\" one of the boys said. He had a toothy grin on, the kind that made my skin itch and crawl. The other guys snickered at his comment. As I made my way out of the changing room, the guy who'd spoken jostled me roughly. Perfect , I thought. Just perfect . I was shaking by the time our warm-ups were done. The bad looks I got from Johnny Lawrence and his five friends seemed to burn through every fiber of my being. To say the least, I was terrified. I knew the beating I'd gotten yesterday was nothing compared to the beatings that were sure to come. I desperately wanted the earth to open up and swallow me whole – anything to not be in the same room as them. I could feel myself growing more and more pale by the second; it was a miracle I was still conscious with how little blood there was in my head. Then, Kreese began talking. \"Fear does not exist in this dojo, does it?\" he barked. \"No, sensei!\" The force and severity with which everyone around me had shouted sent a cold shiver down my spine. \"Pain does not exist in this dojo, does it?\" he continued. \"No, sensei!\" \"Defeat does not exist in this dojo, does it?\" \"No sensei!\" One of Johnny's friends gave me a pointed look. I knew what he meant – do what they do . He, too, had pretty eyes – a somber grey that rivaled Johnny's – and blonde hair, though his was significantly darker, like ash. \"Fear does not exist in this dojo, does it?\" Kreese repeated. I glanced around once and then tensed up. \"No, sensei!\" we all yelled. \"Pain does not exist in this dojo, does it?\" I breathed in. \"No, sensei!\" \"Defeat does not exist in this dojo, does it ?\" \" No, sensei! \" Kreese's face hardened even more, if that was possible. \"Combat!\" he shouted. Everyone formed a rectangle around the mat. I squeezed in between two brown belts, trying hard to make myself as small as I could. Maybe Kreese wouldn't notice me, though with my bad luck, I doubted it. Dutch and Johnny grabbed the point flags and stood on opposite corners of the rectangle. Kreese's eyes scanned the crowd, landing right on me. My stomach dropped. \"Brown, Gray!\" Kreese called out. The boy with the pretty grey eyes shot up. I got up, too, shakily and unsure. The guy who'd jostled me in the change room snorted in derision. If I was in his place, I would have had the same reaction. I looked ridiculous. \"C'mon, Bobby!\" he urged. Bobby Brown. At least his name was nice. It didn't really matter, though; he would kick my ass seven ways from Sunday. Fear does not exist in this dojo. Yeah, right. I was terrified of Bobby. I was terrified of everyone here. Maybe if I hadn't gotten my ass kicked yesterday, it wouldn't have been so bad. But I knew what to expect and the anticipation was almost worse than the actual pain itself. Almost . Bobby and I walked to the black lines in the middle of the mat. We bowed to Kreese, and then bowed to each other. \"Fight!\" Kreese exclaimed. Bobby got into his stance. I did the same. It surprised me that he didn't have the same cruel jeer that the rest of Johnny's friends did. If anything, he looked concerned. It was such a nice gesture that it took me by surprise. He glanced at Kreese, then at Johnny, then at me. I'd have killed to know what he was thinking. Bobby moved in quickly and front-kicked. I dodged and stumbled backwards. Some of the guys laughed quietly and I felt my cheeks turn red, both in anger and in embarrassment. Bobby didn't laugh, though. He inhaled and then kicked again. It was harder to dodge that time. He was going easy on me, another kind gesture that did not go unnoticed. I was sure I would have never received that kind of courtesy from the rest of his friends. Even in the changing rooms – now that I think about it – Bobby hadn't laughed along with the others. But being nice didn't earn any favours with Kreese, and Bobby seemed to know that. His blows became harder and harder to dodge and he was getting impatient; with one swift kick, he knocked my legs out from under me. I landed hard on my back. The air from my lungs lodged itself in my throat, cutting my gasp short into a whimper. The shock came in waves; first there was pain, and then there was numbness. My chest ached with every ragged breath I took, the bruises from yesterday's beating pulsing in complaint. But I didn't have time to be dazed. Bobby lunged to deliver what he probably thought would be the finishing blow; I rolled out of his way and kipped up. Pain does not exist in this dojo. If only. Everything hurt. I wanted the match to end. I wanted to go to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I wanted to be anywhere else but on the mat, under the scrutinizing gazes of Johnny Lawrence and his friends. As childish as it sounded, I wanted to go home . Not in Encino – no, that wasn't my real home. I wanted to go back to Oregon to the little yellow house I grew up in with the baby blue front door and the potted aloe plants on the porch. How nice it would be to go back to my old bedroom and stay there forever. Slowly, I backed up onto my line and exhaled softly. I straightened my stance, despite my back cracking in protest. Bobby's eyes flickered over to his friends. He didn't seem too hesitant anymore. Good . Neither was I. He coiled to strike but I was quicker; I spun into a roundhouse kick that hit him square in the chest. Bobby fell back and I dropped beside him with my arm pulled back, ready to hit him again and win the match. But then his pretty grey eyes got to me. I couldn't . Not after how nice he'd been. Not after how easy he'd gone on me. Not after how he'd been the only one in the dojo to show me any amount of decency. \"Finish him!\" Kreese yelled. One hit , I told myself. One hit and it will all be over. I took in a shaky breath. Defeat does not exist in this dojo. So, I hit him – a blow to the neck, hard enough to take away his breath. \"You said you wanted to see me, sensei?\" I said, clasping my hands behind my back. Kreese was pacing around the empty dojo, his eyes hardened into his usual glare. I considered it somewhat of a blessing to be asked to stay behind; the rest of the boys were changing and the last thing I wanted was for them to see me taking off my karate-gi. \"We do not train to be merciful here,\" Kreese said. \"I shouldn't see any hesitation during your matches. When you step onto that line, the person opposing you becomes your enemy. And an enemy deserves no mercy. Is that clear?\" \"Yes, sensei.\" \"Good. Go get changed.\" I bowed and headed for the change rooms when Kreese spoke again. \"Tell Mr. Brown I want to see him.\" Uh-oh . That couldn't be good. I wasn't the only one that had shown hesitation during our fight; Bobby had gone way too easy on me. He was going to get chewed out a lot worse than I had; after years of Kreese's regime, he should have known by now that mercy isn't tolerated in the dojo. My feet felt heavy as I walked inside the changing room. Everyone stopped whatever they were doing and stared at me. I swallowed hard and was about to lower my gaze, until I realized that I didn't have anything to be ashamed of. I was new and I had fought decently. I didn't break any rules or get my ass handed to me. Bobby going soft on me was his choice. There was nothing to feel bad about. I got my clothes out of my bag and took off the top of my karate-gi. I could feel the disappointment around me as the guys noticed I was wearing a camisole underneath. While I got dressed, I couldn't help but think about what Kreese had said. An enemy deserves no mercy . Surely, that wasn't right, at least not in every case. Part of being a good fighter is to know when to cease fighting – or so I'd been taught. I had the feeling that if I ever said that to Kreese, he would belt me across the face and make me do fifty push-ups on my knuckles. But the pieces of the puzzle were starting to fall into place. It was clear why Johnny Lawrence acted the way he did. And being a black belt, I could only imagine how much time he'd spent under Sensei Kreese's influence. He was a lost cause. I looked around. The only people left in the change room – beside myself – were Johnny and his friends. They were talking to each other, eyeing me carefully. The toothy-grinned bastard that had jostled me earlier snickered and whispered something to the others, making them laugh, too. Like before, Bobby was the only one that didn't join in. I gritted my teeth and threw on my shirt. Wanting to take up more time in order for them to leave before me, I went to the small mirror beside the door and began examining the black eye I'd gotten yesterday. I heard them laugh again, and they spoke louder, clearly intending for me to hear. \"Bobby, you should've just given it to her,\" the boy with the toothy grin said. I glared at his reflection in the mirror. \"Yeah, man,\" another boy agreed. He had blond hair, too, but it seemed just a tad too yellow to be real. \"She's no match for you.\" \"Purple belt,\" the first guy scoffed. \"Yeah, right. Purple belt my ass.\" I breathed in slowly and counted to ten. Don't start shit , I told myself. They aren't worth it . \"Hey, Gray!\" the bleached blond called out. \"Show us that dodging technique of yours again!\" \"Watch, I got it,\" the first guy said. He stumbled backwards exaggeratedly and then got back into a stance. As they laughed, I gritted my teeth even more. \"What's the matter, Gray?\" \"I think she's about to cry.\" When I spoke, my voice was surprisingly steady. \"Bobby – that's your name, right?\" I asked, turning to look at the boy I'd just fought. He seemed surprised that I was addressing him. \"Kreese wants to see you.\" That dampened everyone's mood. They knew as well as I did what a talk with Kreese meant. \"Alright,\" Bobby replied. \"Thanks.\" His display of manners was like a slap to his friends. They raised eyebrows at him, and as they all walked out of the changing rooms, I heard the peroxide blond and the other boy crack a few more jokes. I sat down beside my bag and held my hands out in front of me. They were shaking, despite there being no one left around me to make me feel threatened. I hated karate, I hated this dojo, I hated the sensei, and I hated the students. Why did Dean have to sign me up for lessons in the first place? Why did he have to stick his nose where it didn't belong? Why couldn't he have left me alone in Oregon instead of bringing me to California with him? Couldn't he see that I was miserable enough as it was without him making it worse? I didn't realize I was crying until tears started pooling on the tiled floor below me. My back tremored with sobs. I don't know how long I sat there looking all pathetic and sad, but then the door swung open and Bobby stood awkwardly beside the mirror. Mortified, I dabbed at my face with the hem of my shirt. Bobby went over to the bench where his stuff had been and picked up his black belt; he must have forgotten it in a rush to see Kreese. He was about to head out of the changing room when he stopped short in his tracks and reached inside the pocket of his jacket, taking out a tissue. As he handed it to me, his grey eyes clouded with the same concern as before. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. And then he was out the door.[Chapter 4] QUINN GRAY'S POV: I hitched a cab home after changing out of my gi. My body was too numb and tired to walk back, and I didn't want to grant my mind the freedom that came with walking. I would only end up overthinking things like I usually did and let emotions get the best of me. I'd cried once and it was enough; I couldn't lose myself like that again. It didn't take long to get back to Dean's place. I handed the driver his money and stumbled my way inside. Dean wasn't home; I hadn't seen his Thunderbird in the driveway. Kicking off my shoes and throwing myself on the couch, I turned on the TV and flipped to a cooking channel. As the cook sautéed some onions, I dozed off. When Dean shook me awake, it was dark outside. I blinked and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, sitting up. He held out a bag of take-out; I took it without saying a word. \"How was karate?\" he asked, settling beside me on the couch. I shrugged and started eating. I hadn't even realized how hungry I was until taking the first bite. Dean didn't seem fazed by my lack of enthusiasm for the conversation. \"Listen, I know you're not that happy about me signing you up for lessons, but I figured it would be a great way to get your mind off things.\" His tone was pointed at the end, like he expected me to do just that. I glanced up at him. \"I don't need to get my mind off anything ,\" I said. \"I'm fine, Dean.\" \"Are you?\" \"Yes.\" But my breath hitched in my throat when I said it, almost as if my body was fighting against the lie. I wasn't fine. I could never be fine in California. I'd tried to pretend with Freddy and Alan, but being around them can only do so much. They weren't a cure for the crying and the anger and the pain. They were just a temporary distraction. Dean moved on. \"So, did you make any friends?\" I scoffed. \"No. I'm pretty sure everyone hates me.\" Except Bobby. Bobby was nice. Bobby even apologized, though I wasn't sure for what exactly. Maybe he apologized for his friends. Maybe he felt bad for having walked in on me crying. It didn't matter. \"Why would they hate you?\" \"Remember the guy who kicked my ass yesterday?\" Dean nodded. \"His friends think I'm total trash.\" \"So, kick their asses.\" \"I wish I could.\" My appetite vanished as quickly as it'd come. I put my bowl of take-out on the coffee table and leaned back against the cushion I'd slept on. \"By the way, I got invited to a beach party,\" I said. Dean raised an eyebrow. \"I thought you said you didn't make any friends.\" \"Not at the dojo. I met two guys yesterday at Golf 'N Stuff.\" \"I see.\" He shrugged and picked up the remote, flipping through different shows. \"Did you bring a swimsuit?\" I frowned. I hadn't thought about that. \"No. Guess I'll have to go buy one.\" \"Guess you do.\" Dean decided on an old western and it became clear that the conversation was over. I grabbed my bag from where I'd left it that afternoon and retreated in my room. It wasn't hard to get to the mall. The Sherman Oaks Galleria was a popular teenage hang-out from what I understood; Dean had told me all about it that morning. I hitched a cab there and paid the driver a hefty tip for beating the morning traffic. I had an idea of what to expect. Malls in California were supposed to be the epitome of adolescence. It was the place where cool people went to show off their said coolness. I'd never cared for shopping the way other girls my age did, but then again, Salem's malls couldn't compare to Sherman Oaks. I wandered around for a while, doing nothing but window shopping, afraid to actually commit to a store and go inside. I didn't have much money with me – just what remained of the allowance Dean had given me on my first day in Encino. Surely but slowly, I'd whittled away most of it already. Cabs weren't that cheap; I was going to have to find another way to get around town. I made my way down to the food court. As I was ordering a milkshake from what seemed like a promising food stand, I heard someone call my name. Before I knew it, Bobby Brown was by my side, a smile on his face. He was with another boy – a cute brunet who looked at me with curiosity. He had pretty eyes, too. Goddamn it, what was it with California boys and their overly-attractive features? \"Weird running into you here, Quinn,\" Bobby said. \"How do you know my name?\" I asked. The boy beside him smiled. \"Everyone at the dojo knows your name.\" Bobby jerked his thumb towards the boy. \"This is Jimmy.\" The realization came to me in a rush; I recognized Jimmy. He was one of Johnny's friends, and he, too, had laughed at me on different occasions. Still, there was nothing malevolent about his current expression. \"Nice to meet you,\" I said. The server behind the counter handed me my milkshake, and I started walking alongside Bobby and Jimmy. \"Listen, we want to apologize for Tommy and Dutch yesterday,\" Bobby began. \"I know they can be very annoying. Don't listen to them, okay? We don't.\" \"Which one of them is Tommy?\" I asked. \"The guy who laughs too much and doesn't know when to shut up?\" Jimmy offered. Ah, so he must have been the one with the toothy grin. Which meant \"Dutch\" was the peroxide blonde. \"Got it.\" I shrugged. \"I'm fine. I don't mind it.\" Bobby gave me a look that Jimmy didn't see. He knew just as well as I did that I was lying. He'd seen me cry yesterday and that was a very obvious sign that I wasn't fine, but I wasn't going to admit to anything. Bobby had witnessed too much weakness from my part already. \"So, how come you're at the mall alone?\" he said, changing the subject. I sighed. \"Gotta buy myself a bathing suit. They're a staple in California, apparently.\" \"What are you going to do with a bathing suit?\" Jimmy snorted. I gave him a playful glare. \"I don't know – what could I possibly do with a bathing suit in the land of beaches?\" \"You'll have to forgive Jimmy. Sometimes, he rides the short bus,\" Bobby teased. This earned him a hit on the shoulder from the brunet. It was impossible to think that these two guys could ever associate with someone like Johnny Lawrence. They seemed so nice . It was so easy to be around them, even easier than being around Freddy and Alan. I could see Bobby and Jimmy being my friends, which was a horrible thing to think about because I knew it wouldn't ever happen, not while Johnny continued to dislike me. I took a sip of my milkshake. \"You guys want to tag along? I don't have any girlfriends to give me their opinions.\" \"We'll be your girlfriends,\" Bobby decided, grinning. \"Yeah, because it's not like we have better things to do than to watch you change into bathing suits all day,\" Jimmy added mockingly. \"Perfect,\" I said. \"Let's go.\" Bobby ended up being the most helpful. Jimmy only ever said \"it's nice\" when I picked something out, and then proceeded to stretch and yawn animatedly, hoping I'd get the hint that he was bored. By the time I was onto my fourth bathing suit, he'd ditched, saying he had errands to run. I honestly didn't mind. I liked Bobby a lot more. Bobby also seemed to be glad about being left alone with me. That way, he didn't have to watch what he said. I can't say I was too happy about it; I knew exactly what he had on his mind. \"Listen,\" he began as I browsed through a rack of one-pieces, \"I gotta know something because it's been bugging me all day yesterday.\" \"Shoot.\" \"Did we make you cry?\" I looked up at him and saw him sporting the same look of concern in his grey eyes. \"No. No, it wasn't really you guys.\" I shook my head. \"I just have a lot on my plate, that's all.\" \"Well, you gotta talk to someone about it. If it's bothering you that much, you can't keep swallowing it down – whatever it is that's bothering you.\" I raised an eyebrow. \"Are you offering to be that someone?\" \"Yeah.\" Bobby smiled. It was practically impossible to refuse. He was right – I did need someone's shoulder to cry on. Talking to Dean was out of the question, and I doubted Freddy and Alan had the emotional depth needed to sympathize with me. \"Alright.\" I braced myself on the rack in front of me. \"Where do you want me to start?\" \"Why were you crying?\" \"Because I hate Kreese and I hate his dojo, and I kind of hate your friends.\" I paused. \"And because I hate that I had no choice in anything. Dean signed me up for lessons and I didn't have a say in whether I wanted to be humiliated like that or not.\" \"That's it?\" \"Sort of, yeah. Does it make me sound like a brat?\" \"No.\" Bobby's eyebrows puckered together. \"But I don't believe you. There has to be something else.\" He looked like he was thinking hard. \"Why are you living with your brother? How come he calls the shots for you?\" Ah. There it was, the topic I had so desperately wanted to ignore. My hands were starting to shake. \"Because I don't have anyone else,\" I answered. My voice was unbearably thick. \"My parents died a few months ago.\" It was like someone had jabbed Bobby right in the heart. The look he held in his eyes was pained. I hated that look. It reminded me too much of my own every time I gazed in the mirror. \"I'm sorry,\" Bobby said. Then, he gritted his teeth. \"And Tommy and Dutch only made things worse for you yesterday. Those assholes.\" \"Hey, it's okay,\" I assured him. \"Like I said, I'm fine.\" I dabbed at the dampness around my eyes. \"But thank you, Bobby. You're one of the few people that have been nice to me since I got here.\" He smiled again, though it didn't reach his eyes. \"Anytime, Quinn. Anytime.\" Bobby ended up giving me a ride home on his dirt bike. I was sure that if Dean found out about it, he'd tear me a new one. I was glad to see upon our arrival that Dean's car was, once again, not in the driveway. I ended up buying a black one-piece that had a very deep neck-line. Bobby had picked it out. It was a little more revealing than I was used to but I could see why he thought it was a good choice; all eyes would be on me at the beach party. He definitely knew a thing or two about kicking off a social life. When I got off his bike and handed him back the helmet he'd lent me, Bobby gave me a grin. \"See you tomorrow,\" he said. I winced. \"Right. Great. I can get my ass kicked again.\" \"Hey, don't worry too much about it,\" he assured me. \"You're good. You just need to stop worrying about what other people think.\" \"And that's so easy to do with your friends insulting me every time I breathe.\" \"You're right. But listen, they're just trying to freak you out.\" \"It's working.\" Bobby rolled his eyes. \"I'll deal with them. You just stick to your karate.\" \"Sure thing.\" I smiled. \"Thanks for hanging out with me today.\" \"No problem. Have fun at your beach party.\" And with that, he sped off. So, I'm kind of deviating a little from the original story I wrote, but like I mentioned before, there's a bunch of things I've always wanted to change about Quinn and her relationship with the movie's characters. Still, I hope you guys enjoyed this part![Chapter 5] QUINN GRAY'S POV: The next morning, I arrived at the Cobra Kai dojo at seven-thirty. I didn't want to take any chances; I had to change into my uniform without anyone around to walk in on me. Surprisingly, I wasn't as nervous as before. Bobby's words had comforted me more than I'd expected them to. The prospect of seeing Johnny Lawrence and his friends no longer scared me – if anything, it was almost exciting. Almost . I changed into my gi slowly and carefully, poking at the place on my chest where Johnny had hit me a few days ago. It barely hurt anymore. All I had to do was not get hit there again and I'd soon be back to normal. Easier said than done. After getting changed, I went out to the training area and began stretching on the white mat. First the neck, then the arms and the torso, and then the legs. I made sure to focus on my breathing and my stances. Everything had to be done perfectly if I wanted to be better than everyone else. Sensei Kreese had a smile plastered on his face as he watched. \"Gray,\" he called. I straightened and assumed a resting position. \"Yes, sensei?\" He grabbed two kicking pads from the bench in the visitor's gallery and then secured them around his arms. \"Give me a jacknife,\" he instructed, holding the kicking pads up high. Fear jolted through me. When was the last time I'd done something as flashy as that? I was sure to embarrass myself in front of him. Was that what he wanted? Was this some sort of payback because I'd defeated Bobby? \"Sensei, I don't know if I can,\" I said. \"Your brother told me you used to do them just fine. I'm not going to ask you again, Gray.\" My brother? How did my brother know what I could or could not do? Had my parents told him that much about me? I pushed the thought aside and swung my whole body around, kicking the two pads decently – the first with my right foot, and the second with my left heel. My landing was terrible, though. I stumbled and fell backwards onto the mat. Pain shot up my ankle. \"You kick like a drunken duck,\" Kreese said. \"Do it again. And this time, maintain eye contact.\" I kipped up. Something about the way the lighting in the room seemed to bounce off his light blue irises made him seem a little more harmless than yesterday. I knew that he could snap my neck like a twig if I ever did anything to piss him off, but today, he looked… friendly . Again, I swung my legs again, and the only time that I ever took my eyes off his were when I was turned around. Even then, I always had a good idea of where he was standing and what he was doing. My landing wasn't as bad that time; I managed to land on my feet, though rather shakily. \"Better,\" he said. \"Again.\" I did as he instructed. Truth be told, I didn't see why he was trying to perfect my jacknife. It was more acrobatics than karate, even though if used correctly, could be very powerful. But you had to be sure your opponent was already dazed enough to some degree. They had to have lost focus for something as flashy as the jacknife kick to work on them, or they had to be very impressionable. Either way, I was sure it wouldn't work against Johnny Lawrence and his gang. I repeated the kick again and again. My head felt like it was going to explode. After a while, I couldn't see straight and I could barely stand on my two feet without wobbling. I tried to keep my eyes fixed on Kreese, but at one point I saw two of him, and I wasn't sure which one I was supposed to look at. I wanted to stop. I needed to stop. The actual lesson hadn't even begun and I already felt like collapsing. What was Kreese waiting for? What did he expect out of me? How long was I going to keep kicking for? I gritted my teeth. As I spun around, I gave him the hardest kick yet. Kreese slid backwards about an inch. He remained silent for a few seconds and his eyes narrowed themselves in a half-glare. My veins turned cold; Kreese looked like he was about to slap me. As I was getting ready to feel the stinging burn of his hand, he did something that surprised me. He laughed . \"Would you look at that?\" Kreese said. \"You're better than I thought.\" I let out a nervous chuckle and assumed my resting position. \"Maybe you're not going to be difficult to work with. Isn't that right, Mr. Lawrence?\" Lawrence? As in Johnny Lawrence? My head snapped towards the door and I went rigid. Johnny and his four friends were standing in the visitor's gallery, each with different looks on their faces. Tommy and Dutch looked taken aback, and Bobby and Jimmy were both grinning widely. Johnny was the only one who remained stoic, and I felt a wave of disappointment hit me. His eyes – cerulean blue – bore right into mine. \"Yes, sensei,\" he replied. Kreese turned to the boys. \"Go get changed,\" he instructed. Then, he took off the kicking pads and dropped them on the bench in the foyer. \"Come on,\" he said to me. I joined him where he was standing. He pointed to a poster on the wall. ALL VALLEY KARATE CHAMPIONSHIPS – DEC. 19 TH \"Every year, my best students enter,\" Kreese said. \"Keep up your training and you could, too.\" My eyes widened. Though I tried to keep my hands firmly by my side, they were shaking. He wanted me to compete ? I didn't stand a chance, not with Johnny Lawrence and his friends around. Bobby might have gone easy on me during training, but he sure as hell wouldn't throw a tournament match. I was sure that if I had to face him, friend or no friend, he would pulverize me in two seconds flat. But I couldn't say \"no\", at least not right away. I'd find some excuse later. I still had months until the tournament. \"Thank you, sensei,\" I said. Kreese turned his head towards the changing room doors. The boys were huddled around it – Tommy, Dutch, and Johnny were glaring at me. Great. They'd overheard. They were never going to let me live that down. I wasn't tournament material and they knew it. \"Didn't I tell you to get changed?\" Kreese snapped. They disappeared through the archway. I slowly walked towards the nearest wall and leaned back against it, trying to catch my breath. More boys piled in and they all headed for the changing room. I kept peering at the door, heart beating faster every time it opened. I was expecting to see Johnny come out of there with a sneer on his face; I was expecting him to laugh at me and tell me that my kicks were so choppy and amateurish; I was just waiting for to label me as a dilettante and then have his friends join in with the teasing and mocking. But when he did come out of the change room, Johnny didn't say anything. He didn't even look at me. His friends were sullen too. Only Bobby and Jimmy smiled at me encouragingly. They didn't feel too bad about me potentially fighting alongside them. Bobby leaned over and told Johnny something that made him glance back at me. His eyes met mine and instinctively, I narrowed them in a cold glare. Johnny hesitantly looked back at his friend. Dutch said something while grinning and Johnny rolled his eyes and hit his shoulder playfully. Bobby smiled, looked at me and then at Johnny. He continued to speak and Johnny listened to him, with Jimmy occasionally speaking up, too. Then, Johnny said something in reply, his lips barely moving. Bobby nodded. Tommy and Dutch howled with laughter, earning annoyed looks from the rest of their friends. I remembered what Bobby had told me about how he'd deal with his friends. Was this it? What was he telling them? My feet turned to lead. Was he telling them the stuff I'd told him in confidence? Had he pretended to be my friend just so he could find new things to laugh at with his actual friends? I swallowed hard and pushed those thoughts out of my head. They could wait until after the karate lesson. After everyone finished stretching, we practiced some drills. Johnny took over Kreese's role as the instructor – he stood at the front of the group, facing us, warming us up. It was so clear he was the favourite. What a brat. After getting fired up, we started matching. I didn't go first, to my immense relief. Dutch was up against another black belt. Tommy cheered him on as soon as he stood up, and Dutch's lips curled into a smirk. The match hadn't even started properly and Dutch knocked the other black belt to the ground. The black belt moaned a little and tried to get up, but Dutch didn't think twice; he hit the back of his neck and made him fall to the ground again. Kreese gave him an approving look. Dutch strutted cockily back to his spot and sat down. I'm dead , I thought. Deader than dead. Jimmy was up next. He was the only brown belt of Johnny's group, but that didn't make him any less talented. He, too, was paired up against a black belt. Jimmy was more of a dodger, so to speak. He was quick and slender, and he easily slipped past his opponent's blows. When the other guy let his guard down for a quick second, Jimmy sprang in and side kicked him in the chest. The black belt fell, and Jimmy delivered the final strike. That also earned him a look of approval from Kreese. I cheered when Bobby went up, which earned me strange looks from the rest of his friends. He was paired up with a much stockier guy but that didn't faze Bobby; two kicks were all it took to bring his opponent down. It became painfully obvious just how much Bobby had held back on me before. There was no hesitation about him anymore; he was Kreese's student, through and through. \"Gray, Hale!\" Kreese called out. Tommy stood, his usual shit-eating grin plastered on his face. So that was his name. Tommy Hale . It would have been nice if it hadn't belonged to a piece of shit like him. My blood was pounding in my ears as I moved to the center of the mat. \"Fight!\" Tommy got into a stance, as did I. It surprised me how calm I was. I was waiting for the nerves to kick in but all I felt was anger. I was seething, seeing red. \"Kick her ass, Tommy!\" Dutch urged. Bobby's words came into mind. You're good. You just need to stop worrying about what other people think. Tommy thought of me as a joke. It was easy to use that to my advantage. He wouldn't see his defeat coming. He moved in to strike and I dodged. There was no stumbling this time. I feinted with a roundhouse kick and just as he was about to block it, I spun the other way and swept his legs out from under him. He landed on his back hard. I waited as he got up. I didn't want to attack him when he was down. There was no challenge in that. Tommy wasn't amused anymore. Even Dutch looked worried. The match wasn't the easy win everyone thought it'd be. \"What are you sitting around for?\" Kreese bellowed. \" Move !\" Tommy did just that – he threw a series of punches, followed by a front-kick, all of which I blocked. The more I focused, the more time I had to counter his blows. Everything seemed to be happening so slowly and I could see his moves before he put them into action; was this what being good felt like? I thought back to the numerous sparring sessions in Oregon. Had I ever felt this at ease while fighting someone? I couldn't remember. Tommy was starting to make mistakes and leave openings in his defense. Was this how much I fazed him? Had he been thrown off by how much effort he was forced to put into the fight. I feinted another kick and sent a punch to his stomach and one to the side of his head. I didn't feel bad at all when he dropped to his knees, face contorted in an expression of pain. It felt good to hurt him. My eyes flickered to Kreese, and he nodded as if he could tell what I was thinking. I turned and swung my legs like I'd done that morning. Tommy's pupils dilated, but his defense was too slow; I sent a kick to his chest and another to his jaw. I don't think I'd ever performed a more perfect jackknife than that. The fight was over. There was no doubt about it; I'd won. The tension in the dojo was palpably thick. A heavy silence formed – and was broken just as quickly by Kreese. \"Alright, next match!\" he said. \"Robertson, Adams!\" It felt surreal to think that I'd defeated Tommy. I knew I won the match because I took him by surprise. He'd underestimated me and that had been his biggest mistake. I was sure he'd thought that since Johnny had an easy time kicking my ass, he would, too. He'd gotten cocky about it; Tommy was nowhere near Johnny's level. But I wouldn't get away that easily in future matches. Tommy knew now what I was capable of. He wouldn't let his arrogance cloud his judgement again. The nerves were finally starting to kick in. We'd been following the rules in this match, but I was sure that in a fight where anything was allowed, Tommy wouldn't have lost. And outside the dojo, there were no rules for him to play by. Outside the dojo, it was open season. It was starting to look like I'd made a horrible, horrible mistake. Tommy and Dutch were glaring at me in the changing room. Johnny was nowhere to be seen. Bobby was talking quietly to Jimmy; when he saw me glancing at them, he joined me with a smile. \"Nice moves out there,\" he said. My cheeks heated. \"You're the only one that think so.\" \"No, trust me – everyone's shaken up. You're a threat now.\" Tommy whipped his karate belt onto the bench. \"What the hell is this, Bobby?\" he snapped. \"How come you and Gray are so buddy-buddy all of a sudden?\" I tensed. Bobby gave him a hard look. \"I told you, man. She's cool.\" \"Yeah?\" Tommy rubbed his mouth with the back of his palm. \"She's fighting in the tournament now, Bobby. She ain't even been here a week and Kreese suddenly thinks she's good enough!\" So that's why I was a threat. \"Tommy, relax,\" Jimmy said. He tried to pat his shoulder but Tommy whipped his arm away. \"Such loyal friends you are,\" he spat. \"Were you cheering her on the entire time?\" \"I wasn't cheering on anyone,\" Bobby replied. It was the wrong thing to say. \"No, you weren't.\" Tommy gritted his teeth. \"You were supposed to be rooting for your best friend since the third-fucking-grade, but I guess shit like that doesn't matter when a piece of ass shows up.\" Bobby glared. \"It's not like that.\" \"The hell it isn't!\" The door swung open and Johnny walked in. He wore the same apathetic expression on his face as he did that morning, and it irked me that he could be so cold and so handsome at the same time. \"Gray,\" he said, \"don't get changed yet. Kreese wants to see you.\" I nodded and retied my belt around my waist. Tommy scoffed loudly, and Dutch patted his back. \"You better watch out, Johnny,\" Dutch said, his tone mocking. \"Quinn here is going to fight in the tournament.\" His voice turned icy. \"Though people with shit karate don't stand a fucking chance.\" My lips curled into a sickly-sweet smile. \"Maybe Tommy should train harder then.\" I was out the door before I could see their expressions.[Chapter 6] QUINN GRAY'S POV: I didn't know what Kreese wanted to see me for but it couldn't have been good. I racked my brain for anything I could have done wrong during the match. I hadn't shown any hesitation against Tommy. If anything, I had been a little too eager to beat him up. Strike first, strike hard, no mercy – I'd nailed three out of three. It didn't help that Johnny Lawrence was trailing behind me, still in his uniform. He had a hard look on his face – the way he always did when it came to me, now that I thought about it. Kreese motioned for the both of us to join him in the middle of the white mat. Oh, no, I thought. If we have to fight again, I'm dead. \"Mr. Lawrence,\" Kreese began, \"I want you to train Quinn. Catch her up to speed with the rest of the group.\" Johnny stiffened. His voice was strained when he answered. \"Yes, sensei.\" Kreese turned his gaze to me. \"You are to follow his every command, is that clear?\" I nodded, throat too dry to speak. It was evident from the way Johnny's lips curled back that this arrangement wouldn't go too well for me. Kreese left us to it. I eyed Johnny cautiously. His face went back into a solid expression. \"Fighting positions,\" he said, irritated. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the rest of the Cobras make their way out of the changing rooms. Tommy and Dutch shot me a nasty look and seemed to communicate silently with Johnny. It wasn't hard to imagine what they were trying to say – kick her ass back to Oregon . Bobby mouthed a \"we'll see you later\" to Johnny and he nodded briskly before they left the dojo. It wasn't hard to keep up with Johnny. He was a good teacher, surprisingly enough; he was straight-forward and easy to follow when reiterating through the techniques I'd learned back in Salem. But it killed me to see him be so cold. I knew beating up one of his friends didn't really earn me any points in his books, but any kind of small talk would have been nice. It didn't make sense for him to dislike me that much. I hadn't done anything to him. It also didn't make sense for me to care about it the way I did. I couldn't explain that either. I knew it was stupid to worry about what Johnny Lawrence thought. It was all Dean's fault – if he hadn't signed me up for karate, I wouldn't be so distracted by the blond. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I'd done something wrong. \"What's your problem?\" I snapped. Johnny's eyes narrowed. \"I don't have a problem.\" \"Yes, you do!\" I urged. \"You've been pissed at me since I joined the dojo – you and your friends.\" He scoffed. \"Get over yourself. Not everything's about you.\" His words were like a blow to my stomach. I gritted my teeth. He was right; not everything was about me. But he and his friends were laughing at my expense. \"Am I a threat? Is that it?\" \" Please , with your karate?\" I placed my hands on my hips. \"What's wrong with my karate?\" \"It's shit.\" Another blow. It hurt a lot more that time around. For a moment, my throat closed in on itself and I couldn't speak. \"It's shit,\" I repeated sourly. \"You think Tommy would agree?\" \"Tommy lost focus,\" Johnny replied. \"That's all.\" \"You're such a dick.\" Johnny's eyes trailed on mine for a little longer – and then he swung a kick out and swept my legs from under me. I fell heavily on my back, gasping for my breath. \" Focus , Quinn.\" There was an edge of humour in his tone that made me want to scratch his eyes out. As I got up shakily, he headed back to the changing room. \"We're done here,\" he added, disappearing through the archway. I headed straight to Golf 'N Stuff after karate. It had been the perfect distraction after Johnny had beaten me to a pulp on my first day at the dojo, so I was counting on it to have the same effect again. Funny enough, I could feel a tradition starting to form; Johnny gets on my nerves, I cool off at the Arcade. Heaven forbid he and I should ever be there at the same time. The Arcade was bustling with people. I didn't see Freddy or Alan anywhere, not that I could see much in the crowd of people. Sighing, I walked around from game to game until I came across a skeet shooting simulator. Three girls were already there, giving it a try – two blondes and a brunette. I watched as the shorter blonde brought the plastic gun up to her shoulder and took a shot, missing the orange disk on the screen. \"Bring your gun up to your cheek,\" I suggested. \"Helps with the aim.\" She did just that and her next shot was a perfect hit. A huge smile lit up her face. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Wanna try?\" I took a shot too, hoping I wouldn't miss. It would have been humiliating if I couldn't follow my own advice. To my relief, I nicked the target immediately. \"You're good,\" the short blonde praised. \"What's your name?\" \"Quinn. What's yours?\" \"Ali. This is Susan and Barbara.\" She pointed to the brunette and the taller blonde. \"Where do you go to school?\" \"West Valley.\" \"Cool. Are you new?\" \"Yeah.\" I was hit with a feeling of deja-vu. The brunette – Susan – eyed me suspiciously. \"I've heard about you,\" she said. \"You train with the Cobra Kai.\" I tried not to look surprised. \"Yeah, I do. How did you know?\" \"Tommy talked about you.\" \"Is he your boyfriend?\" Her cheeks flushed. Beside her, Barbara stiffened. \"Sort of,\" Susan replied. I grinned. \"Don't get mad but I sort of beat him up today.\" Ali giggled at Susan's horrified expression. \"But don't worry,\" I assured her. \"The only damage I did was to his ego.\" We walked around the Arcade for a while, trying out different games while the girls had me recite my life story. Just like with Freddy and Alan, I didn't go into too much detail. They didn't push anyway; Susan and Barbara were way more curious about my karate. \"So did you make any friends at the dojo?\" Barbara asked. \"You guys know Bobby and Jimmy, right?\" I asked. They nodded. \"They're kind of cool. But I don't think the other guys appreciate my presence very much.\" \"Yeah, I heard Tommy and Dutch gave you a hard time,\" Ali said, rubbing my shoulder comfortingly. \"Must be so cool, though,\" Barbara mused. \"Training with cute guys all the time.\" \"Sure, I guess. Honestly, I don't really notice.\" That was such a lie, but I couldn't let them know what my mind thought of every time I saw Johnny's pretty blue eyes. \"Besides, I don't have time to be distracted like that. No one really thinks I'm good enough to be a Cobra Kai. I have to catch up to the rest.\" That part was true. Apparently, my karate was shit. I had to make Johnny eat his words. Susan raised an incredulous eyebrow. \"Good luck with that. Tommy said—\" \"You don't always have to listen to what Tommy says,\" Ali told her. Her tone was slightly clipped. I was grateful; it was starting to look like Susan and I wouldn't get along that great. \"But if you had to pick,\" Barbara continued, oblivious to my distaste for the subject. \"What guy would you go out with?\" I wrinkled my nose. That was exactly why I didn't have many female friends back in Oregon. Along with puberty came the insatiable thirst for boys. Not that it wasn't the other way around for guys too, but at least none of my male friends stuck obstinately to the topic of who would date who when it was clear I wanted no part of the conversation. \"I'm sure they'd never ask me out,\" I said. Barbara was about to say something else but Ali cut her off. \"Quinn and I will go get some milkshakes,\" she said. \"Do you guys want anything?\" The two girls shook their heads. They sighed in disappointment – clearly, they'd wanted to know more – but then went back to scouting the area for games to play. Ali nudged me and gave me a smile as we headed out of the Arcade and towards the nearest concessions stands. \"I'm sorry about those two,\" she said as we walked. \"They're a little jealous that you get to train with Tommy and the guys.\" I laughed. \"So are they both into Tommy?\" \"Sort of. But Susan claimed him first, so Barbara has to make do with Dutch. You know Dutch, right?\" \"Yeah.\" There was a sour taste in my mouth. I knew Dutch far too well. \"So are you into one of the Cobra Kai too?\" I asked. Ali's mood dampened a notch. She suddenly looked very interested in her fingernails. \"Not really. I used to date one of them, but it ended badly.\" It was my turn to pry. I could tell she wanted me to drop the subject but there was an inexplicable coldness in my gut that wouldn't go away. I had to know. \"Who was it?\" She straightened. \"Johnny Lawrence.\" My stomach dropped. Johnny ? I'd thought it impossible for him to be affectionate with anyone. The idea that his blue eyes had ever held a trace of warmth for another person was like a thousand needles to my chest. And yet he and Ali – gorgeous, blonde Ali – had been together at one point. She was beautiful. How could I compete with that? I reeled back. Why was I thinking of Ali as competition? It wasn't as if I liked Johnny. Sure, he was stunning and had gorgeous blue eyes that sometimes kept me up at night, but that couldn't mean anything. Could it? \"Quinn? You okay?\" Ali shook my arm gently. \"I'm fine,\" I answered, swallowing hard. I could barely keep my eyes open from how hard they stung. \"You don't have to worry,\" she said. \"I broke up with him a while ago. There's nothing between us anymore.\" I bet he wouldn't agree , I thought bitterly. It dawned on me that maybe she was the reason why Johnny was so sullen and angry. Losing someone like Ali couldn't have felt good. If it ended badly, chances were he was still hung up on her. I didn't stand a chance. I cleared my throat. \"Why would I worry?\" \"Listen, you can fool Barbara and you can fool Susan, but you can't fool me,\" Ali said. \"I get it. I used to like him too. He's great in a lot of ways.\" She paused and shook her head. \"But he thinks he can get away with doing whatever he wants.\" It was like my veins turned to ice. Sure, I'd had my doubts about him from the start, but hearing Ali confirm them was painful. Stop caring, Quinn , I told myself. But there was no use. I was a lost cause. \"The girls and I are having a beach party this Sunday,\" Ali continued, changing the subject. \"You want to come?\" I smiled apologetically. \"Sorry. A few guys have already invited me to one that day. But hey, maybe we'll see each other around?\" She grinned widely. \"Definitely.\" \"So, you still up for that milkshake?\" ","Summary":" This story was uploaded before on this website, but for personal reasons, I have taken it down. Aft"},{"Movie":"Hansel & Gretel","Title":"Weapons Master","Author":"BlackRoseWater","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10369001","Passage":"[Chapter 1] …And That Folks is How They Met Sweat dripped down the young child's face as clear brown eyes focused on the huge fire in front of her. Beside her was her cousin, he was holding long metal pillars as steady as he could. A loud bang from the timer gong vibrated through them both on the older cousin yanked the pillars out. The child grabbed the molting blob on metal at the end of the pillars and began chanting causing the blob to spin and wrap. The faster the child chanted the faster the blob changed its shape, soon there was a beautiful simple pistol in her hands. \"Well done children well done\" a gruff voice said. The cousins turned to see their master standing in front of the door wearing one of his smiles. If anyone that time looked in to see Master Blacksmith they would have thought he was angry; granted the town thought that anyways, yet to those that knew him knew that he was proud of his son and niece. Behind them the door to the shop opened and a loud bong from the bell the children had step up echoed through the floor. The Master Blacksmith turned and with a hidden hand movement he told the two of them to clean up and come to the front. Unhurried the cousins moved around each like dancers cleaning up and putting away their tools and weapons that they had made. The younger placed her new made weapon on a cloth at the engraving table to be marked before entering the store floor to be sold. When they were done they did a quick rinse and entered the front of the building that was the sole source of their income. The front of the bottom floor held weapons of every kind along with everyday items that the villagers needed to survive. Prices were neatly and clearly mark beside each and every item in the store. The items were also grouped in sections, everyday items people in their homes were together farm equipment and some other outdoors items were in the front by the door. The weapons though they were grouped in such a way that anyone who wanted one would have to ask for help, and that was how the small family liked it. The cousins stopped at the counter waiting for their Master to finish guiding their customer to what they needed…never what they wanted. The door opened again and a pair of child around their age entered. These two were covered head to toe in dirt, smudge and witch's blood. The cousins shared a look, these two were not going to be their normal patron. The siblings for that is what they looked as they approached the counter, plopped a bag of gold on the counter. \"We need weapons that will kill witches\" the boy said in a firm but shaky voice. \"What you need is a bath and clean clothes\" the older cousin answered. He shoved the bag back towards them. \"Follow her and she will set you straight.\" Pointing to his cousin. A stubborn look appeared on their faces; before they could say anything the Master Blacksmith spoke. \"Listen to the lad and in a morn we'll talk\" The siblings whirled around in surprise and stared. The Master was a hard looking man with burns and scars covering his entire body or at least the parts they could see. They gulped and nodded. The younger cousin beckoned them around the counter and up the stairs hidden just off the side. Upstairs was a medium sized area that held the kitchen and dining area. A short hall to the right led to three doors. The siblings followed the girl in to the last door and saw that it was a tiny bathing room. \"Wash the worst off using the buckets tomorrow is cleaning day so my cousin and I will take you to the bathing pool.\" The young girl said pointing to three medium basins \"I go find you clothes\" \"Thank you\" the sister said \"I'm Gretel this is my brother Hansel\" \"Kai\"[Chapter 2] Many, Many Years Later Clear brown eyes focused on a hunk of metal melting in a forge, suddenly a woman's voice started to sing causing the molten metal to spin and shift in to the desired shape. Waiting to reach into the fire was a female troll holding a huge pair on tongs. When the song reached its last note the troll pulled out a wicked looking crossbow. The troll handed the bow to the woman standing in front of the forge. The woman's brown eyes caught the troll's pale yellow ones. \"Thank you Mary\" the woman said. Her green companion grunted in answer. \"Kai\" the woman's cousin called out from the front. \"Got news from our favorite twins\" A gruff looking man with bright blue eyes and sandy hair cut close to his scalp entered the forgery. He held up a scroll that will have the some form of news on it. He moved to sit on the only stool in the room and procced to open the paper. The woman Kai took the crossbow to the engraving table and began the process of fortifying the bow, with each craving she cast a protection and true aim spell in to it. Opening a small draw from the cabinet to the side she pulled out strands of unicorn hair. Mary in the meanwhile was breaking down the forge and cleaning the area for the day. \"Hmm says here the twins broke up a witches gathering and killed a Grand Witch\" Reed said Kai paused in her braiding and looked at him with a raised eyebrow. He glanced at her a grinned. \"The m one don't remember her name\" \"They killed Marissa?\" Kai asked giving him her full attention; even Mary paused to listen. \"Yep and found out a whole lot of news about their family…lets see…oh they picked up a few companions, hmm ah here it is…no way\" he looked at his cousin with wide eyes and a dumbfound exasperation. \"They are the children of Melinda\" \"Really\" \"Here\" he hand her the letter. Kai took it and began to read scanning over most of what was already said; noticed that their new companions where called Edward and Ben. Yep sure enough they were the children of the Grand Witch Melinda. Kai hummed a little at the blurb of Hansel's interest in a witch named Gina. Kai paused and stared at out the window at the engraving station. The name Gina struck a cord with her. She stood handed the letter back to Reed and went upstairs mumbling under her breath. Reed sent a confused look to Mary who shrugged. \"Well it is no good getting anything out of her while she is like that\" he said going back to the letter. \"Hey Mary?\" A grunt answered him. \"How soon can you get the guest room ready the twins are stopping by and given that they sent this letter an hour before they left I say they'll be here around dinner…maybe.\" Mary held up a fist. Reed beamed at her. \"Great I'll start on dinner.\" Mary grunted again as he took off upstairs. She shook her head, her witches were very strange at times. Kai was hip deep in the chest her father had made for her mother as a betrothal present when she found what she was looking for. She pulled her upper body out of the chest and sat in front of it with a small narrow box; the box was made from red oak and had a simple craving of a fire on the top. Touching the craving lightly she opened the box and nestled inside it laying on red silk was a white wand made from aspen. On the inside of the lid was a folded piece of paper. She unfolded it. Pillar This wand belonged to the white witch Gina. With her passing no family has laid claim. Find a worthy successor. FK A few sentences that nothing more nothing less. Well at least Kai knew who she would be testing first. She closed the box and stuffed the note in her apron pocket. Putting back everything she took out hunting for the box she heard Reed in the kitchen singing the awful tavern songs he liked off key. There are times like these that I am aunt taught me to channel my magic through song and not her son. Smiling she headed to the wash room to clean up before dinner. A tall lanky boy stood in front of the widest building he had ever seen. Hanging above the door was sign that had a hammer pounding on an anvil. Beside him was his heroes and the groups very green friend. Ben looked over at Hansel and Gretel unsure about this, as much as he wanted to meet the person that supplied their weapons he was not sure that he was entirely ready for it. Before he could say anything the largest gruffest looking man stomped around the side. He stopped at the sight of them and let out a loud cry of happiness. \"Twins\" the man said in his very loud voice and stomped towards only to scoop Hansel and Gretel in a bear hug. He set them down and petted Hansel's back with a thump. \"Come, come dinner is ready and the guest room is ready for you and your…\" the man turned towards him and Edward. \"Who are you?\" \"This is Ben and Edward, Reed they travel with us\" Gretel said. The man waved his malt hands. \"Yes you said that you had companions. Come, come Kai is waiting.\" The man now known as Reed led them around the back and waved them into the building. The first thing Ben saw was a forge, considering that it took up half the room it was no surprise. The entire room was clean and weapons of every shape size and form where either hanging on the walls are sitting on tables. The forge itself was warm and glowing embers radiated heat. Reed ushered them through the room and upstairs to the kitchen/dining area. \"Ben follow Hansel to the room where the two of you will be staying Gretel you already know where you will be staying, and you\" he said turning towards Edward. \"You will be staying with Mary, if she'll let you, be warned if she says no I am sure we can round up some old pillows and blankets for you to sleep on in front of the forge, you will not fit in with us males we only have so much room.\" Edward blinked at Reed in mild shock. Soft laughter came from behind them at entrance of one the doors. The group turned and all the males were promptly shoved out of the way. \"Kai\" Gretel yelped hugging the black haired woman in a bone breaking hug. \"Oh it is good to see you, I have missed you and Reed.\" Ben stared in confusion at the seemly sudden change of Gretel, Hansel snickered at his face, that drew the woman out of Gretel's embrace and Ben lost his ability to think. The woman was stunning; her black hair flowed down her face in gentle waves and her eyes warm of summer bark, and she was suddenly focused on him. Gretel bit back a grin while Hansel did nothing to hold his back. They had seen the effect their exotic friend had on the men and boys in this town in the few times they had been here. Gretel knew that Kai would deal with as she always had, ignore it. \"You must be Benjamin\" Kai stated noting the glassy eyed look every male got that met her; there was a reason she hid in the forgery every day. This young male however did not need nor probably want the troubles that would were sure to follow. She pulled out a small vial and held it out to him. \"Can you drink this me\" she asked with a flutter of her eyes and sly smile. The poor boy mutely nodded and did as she asked. As soon as the vile concoction was down his throat he shuddered and blanched. \"Feel better?\" Ben blinked and zoned in on the brown eyed woman in front of him; behind her Hansel and Gretel were staring intently at the woman's back. He swallowed and nodded. \"Good\" and she dismissed him. \"You are Edward yes?\" Edward must have nodded, yet Ben was still trying to figure out what had just happened to him. The woman…no Gretel said she name was Kai, was still pretty yet as he looked at her he didn't have the urge to…well he didn't know what he was going to do but he felt it was bad. The next thing he knew he was in a small room that had two single beds and a small chest at the foot of them with one window taking up half the wall. This wall pointed to the next building which he could see over. Hansel dumbed his gear on the bed and took of his coat. \"What happened?\" he croaked out. Hansel looked at him. \"Kai has an effect on men and boys close to age, which is why she does not go out very much.\" Hansel sighed \"it got really bad once, Gretel was with her, when Reed's father brought them home they refused to say anything and Kai was only allowed to go out only if Reed went with her. To this day Gretel still won't say what happened.\" He shook his head \"As to what Kai gave you no idea but it broke you out of being stupid.\" \"FOOD\" Reed's voice echoed through the floor and Ben jumped. Laughing Hansel clapped him on the back and they headed to the kitchen. \"No\" Kai snapped when the two woman where alone in Kai's room. Her room looked exactly like the one Hansel and Ben were in only that he chest was bigger and that it was engraved with animals and plants from her mother's home country. She sat on her bed and watched Gretel put her gear away in neat piles. Gretel never said anything knowing that it was hard for her friend to be so different at times and whatever gifts she had were equally hard to bear. Kai sighed knowing that sooner rather than later they would want to know what was in that vial. \"FOOD\" Reed's booming voice hailed them and the females shared a grin and wandered in to the kitchen. The others were already there, Gretel stopped at the sight of a female troll in a plain rust colored dress with an equal plain brown apron. She was standing next to Edward and the two of them were in a deep conversation in what must be trollish. She shook her head and sat down to eat. None of them talked while they ate for all of them have had a long day and the mild excitement was waning. After dinner Mary the female troll shooed them away, while she and Edward took care of the dishes. Reed led them to his room which was his father's until he died, it was the largest. In the corner across from the only double bed in the house was a pair of benches with pillows. Once they were all seated Reed pulled out a few bottles and gave the woman two, Hansel one and kept the last. \"You too young\" he said pointing a finger at Ben. \"Though it is rude not to give you something.\" He handed him a small bottle full of a weaker batch. \"Right who's first?\" \"It negates the effect of being bewitched\" Kai blurted out \"You will never be overtaken by pheromones my kind emit ever again.\" \"What are pheromones?\" Ben asked \"What do you mean your kind?\" asked the twins Kai took a deep breath, however it was Reed that answered. \"Our mothers were sisters that is how we are related.\" He took a swig. \"My father met them while they were on the run. They never did tell him what it was they were running from; that is irrelevant, they did however tell him what they were and some many other interesting facts about those that are different from normal everyday humans.\" He sighed and glanced at Kai who from the look of it hadn't touched her drink. She nodded and then procced to down the bottle. \"Our mothers were witches\" Kai stated \"Not just any witches in their part of the world they were Grand Witches\" She gave a half huff half laugh. \"The thing with witches is that only the females can pass on the gift no matter the sex of the child. Mother lived long enough to see Aunt married to uncle and my father to come find them.\" Reed started at that, he had always wondered why none of the adults had spoken about his uncle. \"Uncle never found out who it was that sired me, aunt knew the moment I was born apparently I am named after him as a bow to tradition.\" She gave the group a sardonic grin \"every first born of my father's line is named Kai\" She held out her hand for another bottle, Reed passed her one. \"What do you mean the children of a witch has the gift?\" Gretel asked \"Just that\" Kai slurred \"I am a witch tough my children will never be witches\" Reed said waving a hand at himself \"apparently it is to keep balance or at least that is what Mary says\" \"I'm a witch?\" \"Is your father named Kai as well?\" \"So that means my children will be witches?\" All three of the cousins' guest asked at the same time. \"Yes, no and yep most defiantly\" Kai answered pointing at each of them. \"I am surprised none of you are spouting betrayal and stringing us up; though it would be interesting to see untrained and unarmed do it…by the way Hansel\" He had her attention \"Would you like to get rid of your sugar sickness, or at least get it down to where you don't have to jam a needle twice a day in your legs?\" His bottle would have dropped to the floor unless Kai caught it. She had used magic not really thinking with so much drink flowing through her veins. She floated the bottle to the side and set it down beside his foot. Reed sighed again and took the current bottle from her and pointed to her room. \"Bed talk more tomorrow\" She saluted him and slowly walked to her bed like she was using the last of brain to focus. When she was gone he turned towards the others, every single one of them were wide eyed, and he repeated his order. \"Bed there will be time to talk tomorrow.\"[Chapter 3] Hello Everyone, Sorry that it has been so long. In all honesty I forgot that I had this…Had a lot of personal family problems happen since I first posted it. Now that I have found this I swear that it will updated and completed. Thank you for being patience. Look forward to enjoying the continuation of this story and keep an eye out for others. Sincerely BlackRoseWater[Chapter 4] Gina's Wand Hansel shot straight up in a sudden clarity of last night's confusing conversations. Their witches…witches have been making our weapons? Ben groaned and buried his head deeper in to the pillow. Movement outside the room let Hansel know that someone was up and awake. He slipped out of bed not really worrying about waking Ben, that boy would sleep through about anything and unless something landed on him he would not be getting up anytime soon. Opening the door aromas of breakfast greeted his nose and he walked to the kitchen. Kai was already there chugging a large mug of something Edward was also at the table eating while Mary was making more breakfast. Hansel sat down and pulled a plate towards himself and took some of the hotcakes from the platter in the middle. The mug Kai was drinking out slammed on to the table and she was gone dressed in blacksmith clothes, before Hansel could even speak Reed took her spot at the table. \"She will be awake to talk to you around dinner?\" Reed said rubbing the last of sleep out of his eyes. \"We will not see her at all around lunch she will just work through. Take this time to rest and tonight we will answer any questions sober\" Nothing more was said between them. Gretel entered followed by Ben they all sat down and ate in silence. Mary made sure they all had enough to eat and gave them each a mug of bitter tea, she refused to let them leave until it was every mug was empty. \"Right Kai will be busy all day so we are band form the forge, I will be in the shop, Mary will probably go out shopping?\" Reed said stopping to look at Mary. He got a grunt and he nodded. \"You can go with her or help me or rest I will see you all at lunch\" and he was gone. \"I am going with Mary\" Gretel said \"Would you like to come with?\" she asked Edward who nodded. \"I would like to see the shop?\" Ben asked They all looked at Hansel, he could see the worry in his sister's eyes, knew why, he smiled and tilted his head towards her. She nodded and left, soon Ben got up and headed downstairs. Hansel went to his room and got ready for the day. A presence was at his door; it was Kai holding a red oak box. Kai was pledged with images of fire and heartbreak, when she woke she knew that she would not get any rest until she fulfilled on of her duties. She made sure not to talk to anyone until she was ready. She had waited until everyone had left to whatever would fill their day before going back upstairs and grabbed the box that held Gina's partner. The first person she would test would be the one Gina gave her heart to. Hansel's confused look almost made her smile. She beckoned him with a jerk of her head and headed out side. Hansel thought Kai would be on the forge yet here she was leading him to a small grove of trees that surrounded the pool they played in as children. He saw her take a deep breath and hold the craved box out to him. He took it and opened it. A familiar wand lay inside it. Gina He took it out of the case ever so gentle, and warmth and loved filled him. Kai sighed and shook her head. \"Congratulations Hansel you are now the owner of this wand it will not fell you or betray you it will only leave when you are dead.\" \"What\" Kai sighed and sat down on the ground, she motioned for him to do the same. Hansel sat very worried about what was going to happen. He still had difficulty believing that he and Gretel were children of a witch and being told that he was now an owner of a wand did not help much. Kai held out her hands and Hansel went to place the wand in them when she grabbed his wrist and closed her eyes. An image formed between them and Hansel saw that it was Gina. Kai's grip on his wrist tighten in a warning. Hello Gina said This image is just an imprint of your predecessor, to help you understand that the wand you now hold is yours until it is time for you to pass it on. Hansel stared wide eyed at the image. He struggled to control his breathing, Kai did not move at all. The Pillar will help you bond deeper until it becomes second nature, trust the Pillar they know what is needed. Oh and welcome to a long line of… Kai let go and the image left. \"What was that?\" \"What is your favorite weapon that I have made for you?\" \"What?\" Kai sighed again \"Hansel what is your favorite weapon?\" \"Don't have one\" Focused brown eyes stared into his and she nodded standing up. She held out a hand to help him up. Turning Kai dragged him back to the forge. Inside she pointed to a stool for him to sit on. Hansel did still holding on to the wand and box. \"Hold out your hand\" she commanded dropping an ore in his waiting palm. \"No\" she replaced it with another and another and another. This process went on for some time until Hansel hissed \"Interesting\" she yanked it up and threw into the forge along with an entire crate of the same ore. \"Wand\" he handed it over and she threw it into the forge. \"Wha…\" \"Quiet\" Kai stood in front of the smelter and began to chant; Hansel's eyes grew wide, however he did not utter a sound. He knew enough about Kai that when she was in the forge her word was law. Hansel watched as the wand and ore burned and rose shifting and fusing together taking a shape of a weapon that made him want to touch it. Kai's hand shot out and grabbed his wrist stopping him from burring himself. A sly smile was on her lips as she reached out and took that gun from the forge. She went to the craving table and waved Hansel over, handing him a thin blade she pointed at the stool, he sat. \"Let the connection flow and when you are done we will begin the last part.\" Kai left the forge heading upstairs to get a crystal to put on the gun, as she passed the her room a witch's force nearly drove her to her knees. Kai spun, her eyes wide and her breath short. She entered the room letting the pull of the witch summon her. In Gretel's bag was a black wood wand with a blood red stone in the middle. Kai hovered her hand over the wand and a sob escaped her; this wand was once in the hands of a Black Grand Witch. The monstrosities that the witch did with this wand was almost too much for Kai. The only thing that stopped her from destroying the wand was the fact that it had the barest beginnings of a bond with Gretel. Kai would deal with that later right now she had to help Hansel. She left her room and entered Reed's, in the corner was a safe that held precious stones in it. Opening it a pale orange was glowing, she grinned and grabbed it and headed back down. Hansel was just finishing the last touches of cravings on the gun that spoke to him more so than the wand did. A golden orange gem appeared in his eyesight. \"Place this on the gun and think 'whole'\" Kai said Hansel did and the gem sunk into the gun giving it a slight shine. Hansel still did not know what had happened but he did not care he had a new weapon that he knew would never fail him. \"Tomorrow we will start your training before you head out.\" \"Thank you\" ","Summary":" …And That Folks is How They Met Sweat dripped down the young child's face as clear brown eyes focus"},{"Movie":"Karate Kid","Title":"Enter The Cobra","Author":"Writteroftime","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12941871","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"HEY GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT\" The store owner screamed at the young skinny boy who had just stolen 2 loaves of bread from his shop. The shop owner gave chase and fired 2 shots at him with his gun but both missed easily. Once the boy was safely away he turned his run into a walk making sure to keep away from the area as the cops would be here soon. The boy drops down through a manhole and goes into his gangs little hideout. The boy had joined this gang a few weeks ago. It was a legit criminal gang but he was to new for any of the big stuff so was dealing with petty shoplifting still. The boy walks in and greets some of the other young lads there. \"Hey where's the boss?\" he asks in a cold voice, he'd learnt the best way to get respect there is to treat everyone else unimportant with none. \"Round the back grease boy\" the other guy answered casually smoking a cigarette. The boy tensed up he hated being called that but knew he was too new to get away with starting a fight here. So he just nodded and walked to where the leader was. The leader was in a makeshift gym pounding on a punch bag. The leader was a tall well-built man in his early 30s. He had been an amateur boxer in his youth and knew plenty of ways to hurt people. The young boy was inspired by him, he looked so cool in his sleeveless shirts and the snake tattoos on his arms. When the boy entered he looks round and grins. \"Ah Johnny boy\" he uses the boys real name something most round there didn't. \"you get the food I asked for?\" \"Yes sir\" The boy named Johnny handed over the bread. \"Good man that shops not easy to bust from, the storeowners a tough bastard. I'm impressed keep this up and I'll put you onto bigger work.\" \"Thank you sir\" Johnny nodded his appreciation but didn't smile. Not because he wasn't happy but because he just very rarely smiled. The boss considered him. \"you're a good thief, you're crafty and you can manipulate people very well Johnny that's what interested me in you and made me recruit you into our little gang. I knew The Cobras could do with a guy like you. But while you may be as cunning as a Cobra, I still haven't seen the Cobra venom in you. I need to know can you fight?\" Johnny bit his lip nervously, he wasn't the biggest guy in the world he'd been in his share of scraps with other kids and he was tough and could take a good beating (which he mainly did from his father) but he was no expert and truly he wasn't a ruthless person at all. \"I can handle myself well enough sir\" he answered coyly. The boss considers this and nods. \"Okay Johnny boy show me. I need to finish my workout I may as well finish it on you.\" He smirks at the young boy. Johnny froze unsure how to respond. Was he being set up was this a test of loyalty of whether he'd truly fight his boss. \"n..No sir I don't want to fight you\" The boss laughs. \"No? then you are not a true cobra then boy you'll always be an errand boy. Nothing but little John Grease.\" He says in a mocking tone. The tone finally pushes Johnny to the edge, now he didn't care that this guy was about 200 pounds heavier than him or 2 foot taller. He felt pure rage and ran at him swinging punches. The boss effortlessly blocked each of them then counters with a vicious uppercut into johnnies stomach making him crumble to the floor. The boss laughs and steps back but Johnny was already back to his feet and charged him again. The boss was surprised but quickly throws him over his shoulder. But yet again Johnny jumps to his feet and swings again this time he connects with 2 punches which makes the boss stumble a little. Now the boss was no longer playing, he blocks Johnnies punch then smashed him with 2 head butts then grabs him and puts 5 knees into his stomach and ends it with a left hook right to his temple. Johnny crashes into the opposite wall and goes down. The boss smirks but that smirk quickly vanishes when Johnny slowly stumbles up to his feet and spits out some blood on the floor. The boss laughs. \"You really want to keep going kid?\" Johnny just snarls at him. \"You'll have to kill me to stop me\" he says with pure venom and rage in his voice. The boss smirks then kicks him hard in the stomach and hits with 5 punches to the head with no pulling of his power. Johnnies face was now a mess and he went down like a sack of bricks. But yet again pushes himself to his feet. He was completely out on his feet but he pushes himself to continue. The boss bursts into laughter. \"You have a lot of balls kid. I like that, I like that. But you said you're willing to die well The Cobras never die. Repeat it.\" He snarls Johnny could barely focus his eyes but stumbles out the words. \"C..Cobras never die sir\" The boss smiles. \"Good boy now that's what I wanted to see. Yeah you got your ass kicked but I saw the venom in your eyes you need work on your technique sure but that'll come you showed you're scared and tell me Johnny boy whats the first law of this gang?\" Johnny straightened up almost in military posture as he recited the words. \"Fear does not exist in this gang\" \"Good man\" The boss nods. \"I saw potential in you from the start boy but now I see you could be one of our best soldiers. You have the heart of a true Cobra.\" Johnny smiled a genuine smile for once even though his face hurt so bad to move it. \"Thank you sir.\" The boss grinned. \"I see a bright future for you. You're a natural Cobra and I believe you have Cobra blood and one day you'll be the most famous and most feared Cobra and I'm going to help you get there. No one will make fun of your name again everyone will do exactly as you say. One day you'll be a legendary Cobra John Kreese. To be continued. A/N: Hi guys hope you enjoyed the first chapter. Basically this is John Kreeses origin story. I wanted it to be a cliffhanger so no one knows who he is until the end of chapter one but I put in a few references to see if people could guess. Obviously now kreese doesn't know karate, cobra kai doesn't exist and hes not been in the army yet. But I will put this in future chapters. Please review I'd love some opinions.[Chapter 2] For the next 6 months the boss took John Kreese out of doing the grunt work for the Cobras and instead spent all day training him. The training was crude and basic. He was made to be there at 5 in the morning and was sent on a 10 mile run. Then when that was completed he was forced to do 100 push ups on his knuckles, after that he was to pound the bosses heavy bag for an hour. This training wasn't about building technique it was about building aggression and strength. The final part of Kreeses training every day was sparring. He was forced to fight with every member of the gang bare knuckle and full contact. At first John took a beating and was barely able to stand after the session was finished but by the end of the 6 months Kreese was the only one left standing. He had changed his mindset from getting through it to being the one who finishes it. One day the boss calls Kreese into his office to talk to him. \"Well Kreese you've done very well, you've trained hard and have become very strong and I've put a lot of my time and effort into you boy so now its time for you to repay me\" Kreese said nothing and waited for him to continue. \"Theres a number of underground fight events that take place around the city. You are going to fight for me. You're a scrub amateur with no name so you won't be making big money yet but we get you enough fights and you win enough of them then we'll soon move you up the ladder for the big time fights.\" Kreese nods, he wasn't exactly thrilled about the idea because while he enjoyed the training he wasn't sure yet if being a fighter was where he wanted his life to go. But he also knew that if he refused his life would go in a lot worse direction. \"Thank you for the opportunity boss I promise I won't let you down.\" Kreese says in a firm voice looking at the ground. The boss nods as he lights up a cigar. \"I know you won't Johnny boy and if you do you won't have that regret for very long.\" He opens up his jacket revealing a silver revolver. \"Do we understand each other Mr. Kreese?.\" \"Yes Sir.\" 2 weeks later Kreese was in the arena for his first fight. It certainly wasn't the huge posh arenas he'd seen on TV in boxing matches. It was a small dark warehouse with a crappy boxing ring shoved in the middle. The crowd wasn't filed with celebrities. It was filled with small time hustlers and gang bangers. In all honesty the people in the crowd were more dangerous than the guys stepping in the ring. Kreese was sitting in a makeshift locker room. Wearing a pair of black boxing trunks the boss had given him on the front was a large picture of a yellow cobra. Kreese shadow boxed a little to warm up. He had no corner men with him. He had been told he could have some friends work his corner but he believed it was a waste of time. He was the one fighting not those clowns so he'd do it alone. Eventually some rough looking guy in a wife beater walks into the room. \"Kreese from the Cobras? You're up next boy go get some.\" Kreese just nods and gets to his feet and storms out the locker and walks to the ring with the venom of the cobra In his eyes. He knew his life depended on this fight in more ways than one with the most important being if he loses he'd get a bullet between his eyes. Kreese climbs into the ring and looks across at his opponent. It was a heavy set guy who was around the same height as John but about 8 stone heavier. Some of it was muscle some was fat. There was no ring announcer to introduce the 2 kids fighting because frankly the crowd didn't give a shit about their names all they cared about was who'd kill the other first. There was also no referee since there were no rules to this match. The fight ends when the other can't stand up anymore. A bell rings and the fight begins. Though Kreese had been training for 6 months he hadn't a lot about technique all he knew was aggression and power. Strike first strike hard was what the boss had drilled into day after day. So that's exactly what Kreese did he ran at his opponent swinging hook punches at his head. The opponent blocked a few on his forearms then swung a vicious haymaker at Kreeses head. Since Kreese had worked on nothing but attack he had no defensive skills so the punch lands cleanly on kreeses head sending flying across the ring. Johns head was spinning like it never had before and he couldn't see straight but he knew he couldn't stop, he knew his opponent would be on him quick looking to finish the job. Instead of scared Kreese was pissed. How dare this fat shit disrespect him and the Cobras he had confronted him now he is the enemy so now he suffers then he suffers some more. Kreese exploded off the ring and charged in with more punches but this time mixed them up to the body and the head. Soon his opponent began to tire and even though he had more technical skill and strength than Kreese, Kreese was in far better physical condition. After a minute Kreeses knuckles were a mess and his hands were throbbing but he refused to slow down and eventually his opponent succumbs to the pressure and drops to the floor. Kreese screams in triumph and raises his arms to the screaming crowd. He walks over to his opponent who was looking up at him with fear in his eyes. Kreese could've finished this guy off but he decides the guys had enough and turns his back and goes to leave the ring when suddenly he feels a throbbing pain in his ear and he was stumbling across the ring. He quickly turns and sees his opponent had risen and was looking to continue the fight. Now Kreese was extremely pissed. Not at his opponent but at himself he should've shown no mercy to this guy. Kreese steadies himself then his first ever kick. Not some flashy roundhouse kick he'd seen in the movies but just a plain old football kick straight in between the guys legs which bought him low. Kreese then follows up with 2 knees to the head which knock him down to the ground. But John didn't stop this time he followed him down and rained down vicious punches to the guys head then stood up and stomped on his head twice. He no saw he wasn't moving but kicked him one more time to be sure then stormed out the ring. Kreese was sitting against the wall in his locker breathing heavily. The adrenaline finally catching up with him making feel tired as shit and the places he'd been hit hurt like crazy but at least he'd won. The boss walks in laughing and clapping. \"damm son I think you damm near killed that killed good boy knew you had it in you like I said a natural Cobra.\" Kreese nods and gives a faint smile. \"Thank you boss, it was awesome I can't wait to fight again and make you even more money and make the Cobras even more feared.\" Kreese goes to stand up but suddenly the boss punches him hard in the stomach sending him crashing back to the floor. Kreese tried to say something but he could barely breathe as all the wind had been knocked out from him. He looks up at the boss expecting to see anger but he looked calm. \"You may have won the fight Kreese but you made a very rookie mistake which could've cost you everything. You lose focus in a fight and your dead meat boy. This isn't boxing this ain't no gentleman's sport or the noble art. This is fighting life and death. You leave a man still conscious in that he's still coming for you. Do you understand me lad?\" Kreese nods taking deep breaths to be able to talk again but the boss caries on. \"Now we'll say no about it because you won. If you'd lost they'd be cleaning your brains off this floor right now and I'd need to go buy some more bullets. But you won so what have you learnt today Mr. Kreese?\" Kreese moves himself into a sitting position then slowly stands up before standing up and responding. \"That mercy is for the weak sir here on the streets if someone faces you they are the enemy and deserve no mercy. \" The boss smirks and nods and folds his arms. \"Good boy. So next time you get in this ring what're you going to do how're you gonna fight?\" Kreese doesn't even take a second to think before he responds. \"With no mercy.\" A/N: Hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. This story will show all of Kreeses life through the army up to opening up the Cobra Kai dojo. I'll probably end it just before the first Karate Kid but I have got an idea for a chapter being set during the Cobra Kai series which will serve as an epilogue. Please review and tell me what you think.[Chapter 3] For the next 3 years John Kreese became one of the most feared men on the underground fight circuit. No one could give him a good fight. He was too strong and too fast. He still didn't have great technique but he was in brilliant shape and overwhelmed his opponents with his strength and speed and stamina. He was ruthless in his attack using his no mercy philosophy he smashed each opponent with punches, knees, head butts, elbows and eye gouges. He wasn't pretty or fancy but he was effective He was also moving up the ranks in The Cobras. Apart from the fights the boss was now giving him more responsibilities. He was a highly skilled debt collector and could intimidate people into paying without touching. But those who still refused ended up spending months in a hospital bed. He was also helping in robberies and drug deals. One day the boss calls him into his office. As Kreese walks in he notices a Japanese man standing in front of the bosses desk. The man was about 5 stone lighter than Kreese and a foot shorter but the man radiated power and respect. As Kreese enters the boss nods at him. \"Ah John there you are. I'd like you to meet Mr. Lung. He's an enforcer for the Japanese Yakuza but has just moved state side and he's going to get us some connections in Japan. Now I've got work to do John you're to show Mr. Lung around I'm sure you'll be good friends \" Kreese nods and they both walk out and Kreese walks over to Lung. Kreese wasn't intimidated by this guy Yakuza or not he was just a midget in a white suit to him and if he started shit he'd happily send him back to Japan with his head in a bag. \"Nice to meet you.\" Kreese nods at the man. Lung gives him a small nod looking at him like he wasn't worth his time. \"Thank you mr Kreese. I hear you're a pretty competent fighter.\" John nods and smirks smugly. \"I'm not a fighter. To be a fighter I have to be in a fight and none of those prima donnas in the ring can even give me a nose bleed.\" Lung gives a small laugh. \"Ah the arrogance of youth. You think because you can beat some deadbeats in a small warehouse that makes you a warrior? A true warrior knows that he can be defeated.\" Kreese shakes his head and folds his arms. \"Well then I must be more than a warrior because I know no one can beat me.\" Lung frowns in annoyance. \"You have a big mouth. Typical for an American if you were in Japan you'd be getting fished out the harbour.\" Kreese just laughs. \"Well asshole we're not in Japan and you haven't got all your Yakuza buddies around you. You may have the boss wetting his pants over you but you're just a little guy who plays gangster in Japan. This is my territory.\" Lung laughs back. \"Okay mr Kreese lets see if you are as good as you say you are. Where can we settle this business.?\" Kreese smirks. \"So you want to take it there huh? Fine by me let's do this.\" Kreese leads him into the gym and onto the padded mat used for sparring. Lung walks in slowly then removes his shirt. He was ripped all over and his body as covered in Japanese tattoos and scars. They looked like knife and gunshot wounds. The 2 prepare and the match begins. Kreese comes out aggressive as always swinging as hard as he can. His first few shots are blocked but he doesn't care he knows a shot will land eventually and when it does this guy will crumble like everyone else. But Lung continues to block with ease. Not only is he stopping Kreeses attacks his blocks are slowly damaging Johns arms until he has to stop punching because his arms were throbbing. He takes a second then runs at him for another attack but this time before Kreese can reach him. Lung fires out a straight which Kreese never saw coming and it landed straight into his solar plexus. Kreeses breath was gone and he dropped to the floor gasping for air. Kreese looks up at him and Lung hasn't bothered following up. He is just standing there waiting looking completely confident. This just pissed Kreese off more and he jumps to his feet and runs at him again only for Lung to grab his wrist and twist it sending him flying back to the floor. Again He jumps back to his feet and runs in. Lung stops him in place with a side kick which sends him flying back. Kreese was weary but refused to quit, he slowly got back up again. This time Lung goes to finish it and jumps into a spinning wheel kick which knocks Kreese unconscious. Kreese wakes up half an hour later. He was lying in a room he didn't recognise. Lung was standing over him smirking. \"Ah awake at last good.\" Kreese spat on the floor bringing up blood. \"Where the hell am I old man? You better let me out of here.\" \"Or what? You'll kick my ass? You already tried that trick and it didn't end very well for you did it?\" John just glares at him. \"What did you want an apology? Lung just laughed. \"I'd be insulted if you did. I've got a proposition for you. Now do you really think I wanted to work for some small time gang like the Cobras when I was running crews in the Yazuza. I'm looking to take control of a number of gangs all over America so the Yakuza can have a good foot hold in the west. I will oversee every gang but I will need individual leaders and I want you Mr. Kreese to run the Cobras.\" Kreese wasn't expecting that and frowned at him. \"The Cobras already have a leader just pay the boss some cash and he'll happily sign under you.\" Lung nods looking serious. \"Yes he would and that's the problem. He doesn't have the samurai spirit I'm looking for…How would you Americans say it? He has no balls. But you have a fire in your eye. I hit you hard and you never quit. You had no chance of winning but you did not stop trying and I like that. \" Kreese wasn't quite sure how to take that. He stands up and folds his arms. \"I cant betray the boss he's done so much for me, he's trained me, made me who I am today.\" Lung laughs and shakes his head. \"And whats that? A 2 bit thug fighting nobodies in back water brawls for nothing. He'll never have any more use for you than that and when you lose which you will one day everyone does then he will put a bullet through your head with no mercy. He doesn't give a dam about you and he never will. Join me and you will be the leader of the Cobras.\" Kreese thinks about then nods. \"Okay lets do it. How do we do this? We roll up there now and take him out? \"Of course not boy, you're not ready yet, you're strong you're tough but you are not skilled enough. Follow me.\" Lung leads them through the corridors of the building and into a large hall. In that hall was a small group of people sparring each other. All wearing white gis with various colours of belts around their waists. Kreese looks around. \"This place looks right out of a bad movie.\" Lung looks at him. \"This place will be your life. These men are the other leaders I have selected to take other the gangs. They will be your brothers. You will train together, eat together and live together. I will teach you the skills of Karate that you need to destroy the boss and anyone that remains loyal to him. When you reach the black belt you will be ready to make your move. What I will teach you is not about peace its about war, you will learn to be fast and strong and swift, you wont knock a man out with 1 shot you will to kill with 1, everything you do will be to end someone. You will not be merciful anyone who confronts you is your enemy and enemies deserve no mercy. You will learn the way of the fist John Kreese. Any questions? John simply stares in front of him. \"When do we start?\" A/N: Please review. Hope everyone's enjoying it. Getting into the Karate training now starting to mould more into the Kreese we know.[Chapter 4] Kreese had been eager to start training but he wasn't happy about all the traditional nonsense he had to deal with. He had already argued against wearing the stupid looking pyjamas and the white belt. Sure wearing a black belt would be bad ass but wearing a white belt made him look like he was some amateur. But eventually he relented to Lung and changed into it. He walked out of the changing rooms where the other gang members were warming up. Lung looked at him. \"Get your ass on the mat Kreese right now.\" Kreese steps onto the mat and walks ahead which seems to piss off Lung for some reason. He storms over to him. \"What the hell are you doing Kreese?\" Kreese frowns at him not understanding his problem. \"Getting my ass on the mat like you told me.\" Lung glares at him. \"Every time you get on or get off the mat you bow are we clear?\" Kreese takes a deep breath to keep calm then nods and gives a low bow looking to the ground. Suddenly Kreese is knocked to the mat, the back of his head burning. Lung had struck him with a downward elbow onto the exposed part of the back of his head. \"We never take our eyes off an enemy as that could happen. Feel lucky I only struck with 50% boy.\" \"Yeah super lucky.\" He grumbled rubbing the back of his head. \"Do you understand what I'm saying Mr Kreese?\" Kreese sighs then nods. \"Yeah sure.\" Kreese is then slapped hard around the face by Lung, Kreese staggers back glaring. \"What the hells your problem?\" \"In this dojo you will address me as Sensei is that understood?\" Kreese gives an annoyed laugh. \"This is bullshit.\" \"I'm sorry boy what was that.\" \"I said this is Bullshit.\" He repeats louder. Lung steps back and folds his arms. \"Okay if this is to beneath you then you can leave hotshot. Go back to being the Cobras bitch and fighting girl scouts if that's your level in life. Or you can quit your bitching and follow the rules like everyone else. So make up your damm mind are we clear?\" Kreese takes another deep breath then nods. \"Yes Sensei\" \"That's better, now everyone fall in.\" The class makes a straight line with the higher level students at the right hand side and the lower at the left. Lung started by making a speech. \"One thing we must all remember is. In this life we are never safe, we never have true friends. Everyone wants to get one over you, everyone will stab you in the back if they can. You are all here because you are useful to me. But if any of you cross me or if I decide you are not useful to me I will happily kill every single one of you. Everyone on earth is a potential enemy. Is that understood? \"YES SENSEI\" The class roared. After the speech finished the training began. It started with basic warm up exercises you find in any high school gym class. Running, stretching and push ups and sit ups. After that they began drilling blocks. Something Kreese wasn't used to. He had never used defence he just attacked and never gave his opponents the chance to hit him. He thought these blocking drills were useless and had no problem showing it and was bored after covering the upward inward, outward and downward blocks, while Lung was explaining about an upward block he was making sure to look anywhere but Lung. \"Every block you throw you must imagine someone is trying to take your damm head off. Your blocks will not work if you half ass them. When your blocks across yourself you must sure your centre line is covered. If you do not- What is the problem Mr Kreese?\" he stops mid-sentence nose to nose with Kreese. \"Nothing Sensei you carry on but this stuffs no use to me I don't block. I'll join in when we get to busting a log with our hands.\" Lung glared more. \"This is a Karate dojo not a knitting class you don't just pick and choose what you learn and if you continue with this attitude the only thing that hands will be busting is your head. Okay you think these blocks are useless and wouldn't hurt someone. Is that the issue\" Kreese nods glad the guys understanding. \"Okay then. Class prepare for combat.\" As one the group makes a square and sits down. Lung walks into the centre and stands on a line on the floor and points at another line opposite him indicating Kreese to do the same. Kreese slowly walks onto the line. \"What you want us to fight again Sensei?\" \"yes but this time I will not punch or kick you I will simply block lets see how long you last.\" Kreese was confused but was happy to take up the challenge especially seeing the other students were smirking. They believed Kreese was about to get his ass kicked. \"Okay you asked for it\" Kreese ran in with his usual style and every shot he took was blocked easily and good to his word he didn't strike back. Kreese continued his attacks until he realised his arm were burning with pain, every strike he threw and was blocked made his arms hurt even worse. Kreese tried to keep the pace and the power going but was scared of throwing to hard in case it hurt even more. Eventually his arms gave in and he tried to throw a kick. Kreese had never been taught to kick so it wasn't a powerful Karate kick It was more of an old school football style kick. Lung smashed his forearm into the leg bringing Kreese to the ground again. Kreese was in to much pain to get up. Lung stood above him smirking smugly. \"Not bad for a bunch of useless strikes which couldn't cause any damage right Mr Kreese?\" Lung offered his hand to help him up but Kreese ignored it and stood up slowly. \"As you said Sensei everyone is a potential enemy so why would I take your hand.?\" Lung nods and genuinely smiles. \"Good you're learning. But one last point to make here. Kreese get in a combat position.\" Kreese nods and separates his feet and holds his hands up. \"I will now use 4 strikes on you. Lets see if you recognise them.\" With that Lug exploded forwards shooting his arm upwards smashing his forearm into Kreeses chin using the upward block motion, then with the same hand smashed his fist and forearm into the side of Kreeses head using the inward block motion, he then bought his arm outwards into the other side of his head using the outward block motion. Then finally he dropped his arm low and struck Kreese in the groin using the downward block motion. He drops to the floor like a bag of dirt. His head ringing like he'd been hit by a bus. \"Are those moment looking familiar to you Mr Kreese?\" Kreese groans and sits up rubbing his head. \"Yes Sensei.\" \"Good then what are they?\" \"It's the same moves as the blocks Sensei.\" \"Good now fall in Mr Kreese.\" Kreese got to his feet and returned to his place while Lung continued to talk. \"Blocking is the fundamental part of Karate. It may not be as important in boxing or Kickboxing or wrestling but that's all crap those things are sports and have rules and are wearing gloves. We are not wearing gloves, we do not play by the rules, we play for keeps. Blocks can stop an opponents attack and as Mr Kreese just found out can destroy your weapons. Also change the range and they are brutal strikes remember this class. Every block is a strike, every strike is a block. Mr Kreese is an advocate of the best defence is a good offence. That's a valid strategy but not an all-time one. There is a time for offence and for defence. You will learn how to pick between each one and will flow into it like water. Now enough talk everyone give me 50 push ups on your knuckles.\" After this Kreese never again questioned his Senseis methods and threw himself full on into training. Eventually his style changed. He didn't rush as much he took his time and picked his shots. His punches became cleaner and tighter and used more straight strikes. His weapons also increased, he now used a wide variety of kicks which he had become very good at. He also used knees and elbows and other dirty attacks. The training was just as brutal as his with the cobras if not more so. They would all fight each other and at first Kreese got battered but eventually started holding his own and beating the other chosen gang members. He quickly rose up the belt ranks and gained a brown belt. After this promotion he trained even harder knowing he would soon be ready to take the Cobras down and call it his own. The best thing of all the boss approved of his training. Kreese had told him Lung was teaching him Karate but obviously not the reasons why and the boss had no complaints about his guy becoming a better fighter. One day Kreese walked into the dojo and only Lung was there. \"ah Kreese there you are I wanted to speak with you. There's a tournament coming up against some of the best of the best dojos on earth I want you to compete in it.\" Kreese tilts his head looking confused. \"You mean of those tag karate things? Where you have to follow rules and listen to the ref. You've always said this is not a sport and we don't follow the rules.\" Lung nods and casually drops into the splits. \"Correct but this is the ultimate test. Fighting is not all about aggression sometimes you need to play with your opponent. Pull your strikes so they don't damage them, just humiliate them make them feel like they can do nothing to you and make them give up on themselves. That's what these tournaments are. Yes they're total bullshit in terms of realism but you can use it to humiliate them by not giving up a single point. Do you understand?\" \"Yes Sensei.\" A few days later Kreese and Lung were at the tournament. It was a large arena filled with a numbers mats filled with competitors. Kreese was wearing a black gi as opposed to the usual white training uniform. Kreeses gi also had no sleeves. A style choice him and Lung decided would intimidate the opposition by seeing how strong Kreese was. \"Remember Kreese you have to listen to the referee to succeed here but doesn't mean you cant bend the rules. Giving a few low blows will intimidate the others. Everyone is more scared of a dirty fighter than a clean one.\" Kreese was called to a mat where he faced off against another brown belt. The referee instructed them to bow to him which both did. He then told them to bow to each other but Kreese just gave a small jerk of his head. They were then instructed to fight. Kreese jumped into his fighting stance and glared at his opponent and for the first time in a competitive fight did nothing. He just stood in his stance and waited for his opponent to attack. The other guy moved in with a front punch followed by a reverse punch. Kreese deflected both moves then immediately fired off a side kick into his opponents knee which landed hard causing him to drop to the floor yelling in pain holding his knee. Kreese smirked as the crowd booed the exchange. The ref raises his arm in Kreeses direction. \"Warning for illegal contact do that again and it'll cost you a point clear?\" Kreese smirks and nods. \"Makes no difference give him 2 points I'll still beat him.\" The ref chose to ignore the comment and when his opponent was ready he called to fight. This time Kreese attacked but not with the same fire as he used he was aggrieve yet kept his composure. He fired off a 3 punch combo which was blocked but then Kreee raised his leg for a side kick again. His opponent flinched low anticipating it attacking his knee again but this time Kreese drove the kick into his stomach winding him. As the ref yells break Kreese smirks and calls out. \"Whats up sweetheart having trouble breathing?\" He then strolls back to his line and the ref again raises his hand towards Kreese. \"1 Point side kick 1-0 Kreese. Ready and fight.\" Kreese this time danced around the ring not staying still for a second. His opponent was confused by the constant change of styles by Kreese. He flicked a roundhouse kick at Kreeses head which Kreese dodged then fired a reverse punch into his stomach. The ref called break. \"1 point reverse punch 2-0 Kreese. Ready, fight.\" Kreese was ready to end this now and threw a roundhouse kick which missed then used the momentum of the first kick to transition into a spinning heel kick which crashed into his head knocking him to the ground. \"1 point spin kick 3-0 Kreese. Winner John Kreese.\" The ref raised Kreeses hand and blew a sarcastic kiss to his opponent then walked off the mat flipping off the booing crowd. The rest of the tournament passed the same. No one can stand up to Kreeses attacks he knocked everyone into the mat and insulted and humiliated them. The crowd hated but he didn't give a shit he wasn't there to make friends. He easily makes his way to the finals against the last years champion who also hadn't conceded a point the whole tournament. As they prepared Kreese bounced around yelling out to cause more intimidation. As they stepped on the mat Kreese saw it had worked this guy was terrified he was whiter than his gi and couldn't even look at him. The referee was about to start the match when the other finalist shook his head after being asked if he was ready. \"Nah man I'm done\" he motions to the referee. The ref looks at him confused and he shakes his head. \"I'm out it's not worth it. A trophy isn't worth this Kreese guy crippling me.\" With that he ran off the mat. Kreese was furious and yelled after him. \"Get back here coward, call yourself a champion you jumped up little prima donna\" The ref walks over and raises Kreeses hand. \"Winner by forfeit John Kreese\" Kreese yanks his hand away and storms off the mat furious he didn't get the chance to beat the champion, he storms back to the locker room and punches the lcokers denting them. He was looking for his opponent and was ready to fight him right there. But lung came after him and stopped him. \"Oi Kreese calm your ass down.\" Kreese glared. \"I'm gonna kill that little wimp for running away.\" \"Leave the boy be he's not what its important. You were here to learn how to humiliate your opponents and you did. No one got anywhere near you, you pulverised them all and then you made the 3 time champion run off the mat to scared to fight you. If that's not humiliation then I don't know what is.\" Kreese nods and relaxes. \"Whatever so whats next?\" \"Well firstly here's your trophy. But second heres what you've been waiting for John.\" Kreese looks up as Lung reaches into his jacket and pulls out a black belt and hands it to him. \"Congratulations John you are by far my most talented student and the most deadly and vicious. The Cobras is the perfect gang for you it sums you up. The coiled Cobra is ready to unravel and sink its fangs into anything in its way. It's time to strike back and take whats yours. Are you ready for the Cobras to be yours.\" Kreese removes his brown belt and throws it to the side and places the black belt around his waist. He then nods. \"Yes Sensei.\" A/N: Hope you guys enjoy this. It's my longest chapter by far. I was considering more tournament fights but I think making the guy so terrified he quit was more fitting but hey let me know what you think.[Chapter 5] The plan was set in stone. It was now or never for John Kreese. He would either take the Cobras or he would die because he knew the boss would try to kill him for making a move against him. They planned not to take him at the Cobras hangout but at the bosses house. They knew he lived alone, no wife or kids so no complications because no matter what Kreese was he had no desire to hurt an innocent child or woman. They picked the perfect night to do it. The top members of the Cobras were at the house for a meeting. Kreese knew they worked for the highest bidder but would not die for the boss but would happily accept him when he takes over the gang and could pass on the message to the other members that Kreese was running things. Kreese and Lung drive up to the bosses house. It was a large house, not a mansion but comfortable. It had a small driveway and there was a guard Kreese didn't recognise on the door. \"Well Kreese you know the plan first you take the guard down then we go in the house. Put down any security who puts up a fight. We get the boss and the other members you challenge him to fight and then you kick the hell out of him then you kill him. I don't care how you do it but he doesn't leave that house alive clear. I'll back you up with his crew but the rest is up to you. This is your moment. It's time to strike. Remember the rules you and me made up. Strike first, Strike hard, no mercy.\" Kreese calmly nods looking over the house making sure they had missed no details. \"Don't worry Sensei, the old mans had his time. It's time for the Cobras to shed their skin and for the new skin to grow.\" Lung nods. \"I like your determination but lets not forget I will be the true leader you will day to day run things but I will be in charge clear?\" \"yes sensei.\" Kreese nods at him. He looked ahead afraid his eyes would betray his plan. \"Remember Kreese all or nothing. Fear does not exist in this gang does it?\" \"No sensei.\" \"Pain does not exist in this gang does it?\" \"No Sensei\" \"Defeat does not exist in this gang does it?\" \"No Sensei\" Kreese steps out the car and walks up the driveway towards the house. As he gets to the guards eye line he makes the sign of the cobra gang with his hands. The guard looks at him. \"What do you want?\" Kreese says nothing and just throws a straight kick to the guards groin which makes him double over as soon as he does Kreese delivers a knee to his head knocking him out cold. Kreese quickly drops down and takes the guards gun and hides just before Lung gets over to him. \"Nice one Kreese now lets do this.\" The pair step inside and quickly ducks to the side as 2 men exit the nearest room. Kreese walks up and grabs one around the neck from behind and quickly snaps his neck then turns to the other and elbows him in the face. \"Nicely done John\" Lung nods and the pair run upstairs. Lung quickly takes care of 2 guards by the bosses meeting room. The 2 kick down the door and storm in Lung draws 2 guns from his jacket and points them at the senor Cobra members. \"Everyone to the side and stay there. No body moves no one dies. I have no interest in killing you we just want your boss.\" The boss barely reacted and looked between the 2 men still sipping his wine. A thin smile coming over his lips. \"Huh a member of the Yakuza betraying me well that's no surprise. But John Kreese of all the people I expected to turn against me I wouldn't have picked you. You forget your place you little shit. I bought you off the streets gave you a home and a family and a job. This is how you repay me? Siding with the Yakuza for some Karate lessons. Well you may not be a Cobra but you are certainly a snake.\" Kreese shrugs off his jacket and throws it to the side. \"Cut the crap. You did nothing for me. You just used me for your grunt work and then to win you some cash on those fights. If I hadn't made a play for the Cobras I'd be fighting bums for the rest of my life. In this world there are no true friends everyone just wants to get one over you. Everyone is in this life for themselves\" The boss laughs and gets up from his chair. \"You really think you can lead the Cobras? You're just a stupid boy. Yes you can fight but it takes more than that to run a gang.\" Kreese continues as if he'd never heard him. \"It would be so easy to walk in here and put a bullet in you and take the Cobras but I'm willing to give you a more honourable death. You always liked fighting and well you beat me last time. If you want to keep the Cobras you'll to have make history repeat itself.\" The boss laughs. \"Wow this fool has really made you believe you can beat me boy? Your little Karate won't last a minute. Your style before was good but now you're using that bullshit you undid all my work but fine it's time for you to die Kreese.\" He steps around the table and the 2 square off. The boss explodes at him using a similar style Kreese himself used before his training. Kreese blocked all the bosses attacks making sure to smash his arms with every single block. It didn't take long for his punches to start to lose strength and then Kreese went on the attack. He stepped In and smashed a reverse punch onto the bosses nose breaking it instantly. Blood poured from it as he staggered back. Kreese jumped in with a side kick which knocked him clear over the table. Kreese calmly walked around and saw the boss trying to get to his feet. Before he can Kreese kicks him square in the face sending him down again. Kreese grabs him and picks him up. The boss lunges for a tackle but Kreese throws back his and fires 3 knees into his stomach. This knocked the wind out of the boss and he staggered back again. Kreese then slammed a chop into his clavicle breaking it. Kreese waits and the boss throws a half hearted punch which Kreese catches and twists the arm and breaks it. The boss screams and looks around trying to get away but Kreese punches him 3 times then hits him with an upward forearm block right into the chin then just as Lung did on his first day smashed both sides of his jaw with the 2 blocks the finished by hitting him in the groin. John steps back smirking at his work. The boss looks at him. \"Wow..you really have improved but I will not surrender. You want the Cobras you'll have to kill me.\" Kreese nods. \"I know.\" He steps in and hits him with a front kick to the stomach which doubled him over then he wrapped his arm round his the front of his neck look a noose and grabs his own wrist pressing into his neck. \"Sorry boss, I resign\" He breaks his neck and the boss drops dead on the floor. Kreese steps over him and looks at the senior gang members. \"Any objections to me as the new king Cobra?\" The senior members all look at each other then shake their heads. \"Good in that case go get me a car and drive to the hide out to announce me to the rest of them.\" They quickly run out and Kreese turns to Lung and bows to him. His eyes locked on his. \"We did it Sensei. The Cobras are ours.\" Lung nods and returns the bow. \"Congratulations John you did what you always thought you could do win. But now the stories only just beginning.\" Kreese and Lung walk out the house and get in the waiting car. The driver drives them into the city. Kreese calculates the distance. Then speaks to the driver. \"Hey stop the car.\" The driver and Lung looks back at him confused. \"Sir?\" \"You heard me stop the car unless you'd like to be buried next to your former boss.\" The driver quickly pulls over and Kreese looks at Lung who's frowning at him. \"What're you doing John?\" \"Lets go for a walk Sensei. I need to discuss something in private.\" Lung considers then nods and they get out the car and walk into an empty alleyway. \"Alright Kreese whats going on here?\" \"Well Sensei we agreed that you'd take 50% of the Cobras earnings and have all final say on the running of the gang.\" Lung nods looking at him. \"Yeah that's right whats the problem?\" \"Well Sensei I have a better idea. You get nothing and have no say in the gangs running.\" Lung looks at him and laughs. \"That's what I like about you John, you're always a good laugh. Don't forget this wouldn't be possible without me.\" \"No Sensei it wouldn't be but doing this I'd be just as much a slave to you as I was to him and I'm done with that shit. Walk away now and live. I'm giving you this chance out of respect for you.\" Lung laughs again and faces him. \"You think you can take me in a fight now do you boy?\" Kreese shakes his head. \"No Sensei absolutely not, but you taught me to use everything to my advantage and you're forgetting this is America.\" He draws out the gun he'd stolen from the guard and points it at Lungs head, stepping back to make sure he's out of Lungs reach so he couldn't disarm him. Lungs face doesn't react at all and just stares. \"You know Kreese the boss was right you are a snake. I thought you were a samurai but you are not. That's why you will fail.\" Kreese glares not moving the gun off him. \"You said it yourself. There are no friends there is no loyalty. You said you'd kill me if I got in the way of my plans and since I'm your best student it makes sense I'd kill anyone who stands in my way. Last chance walk away and live.\" Lung just smiles. \"You'll pay for this John Kreese. Kill me if you must but you will die a million times over in a lot worse way.\" \"Enough of the fortunate cookie bullshit. I'm sorry it had to come to this but the one fundamental rule you taught me.\" Lung stares at him saying nothing. \"No mercy Sensei\" Kreese fires the gun and shoots him in the head. Lungs body drops back. Dead before he hit the ground. Kreese was emotionless and checked he was dead before wiping the gun of any finger prints and chucking it away. He takes one last look at his Sensei before bowing to his body then turning and walking away and getting back in the car. \"Drive now\" Kreese is taken into town and he stops off at a tattoo parlour and gets himself a grey Cobra put on his arm before heading to the Cobra hideout. He walks into the building and addresses his new gang. The Cobras would now go into new uprising. The Cobras had only just begun. Kreese thinks of the 2 people who got him there the boss and Lung both dead now by his hand. They had died so he could reach his true potential and he guaranteed they would not die for nothing. A/N: Hey guys yep 2 chapters in one day. I wanted to get this put down before the idea slipped from my head. My main focus of this story was not to redeem Kreese in a sense of showing him in a good light. I'm playing Kreese as a terrible evil person but I wanted him to seem scary. Becaue in the movies we never saw him do anything majorly scary himself apart from some bad moral stuff and choking Johnny. We never truly saw Kreese fight. I wanted to put him across as a dangerous and scary fighter. I'm very much enjoying writing this story and I've got an idea of how it'll end. I think there will be around 5 more chapters. Please rate and review guys and be honest I want to know likes and dislikes remember….No Mercy ;)[Chapter 6] For the next 6 months Kreese lead the Cobras in new directions. He was an efficient leader and all the guys respected and slightly feared him. Kreese had started a loan shark business and got himself plenty of money saved in various bank accounts. He had continued working the underground fight circuit. He would destroy his opponents even quicker now with his new skills. He had also started training the other member of the Cobras Karate. He wanted his gang to be able to handle any situation. But he was also smart and made sure not to make them too good as he knew one day one could challenge him just as he had done to the previous boss. He had his students put on gis and found it amusing that a lot had similar reactions to himself at first but all came around and listened to him as he taught his way. He actually found himself enjoying teaching and seeing them all improving. Kreese also used it to teach himself as now his Sensei had a bullet in his head he had no one who could teach him. So he practiced in the ring and in sparring his students and almost redesigned his system. Using different terminology and methods, getting rid of a lot of the traditional elements and making his style more street realistic. After one class Kreese was leaving and removing his black belt when a young lad called Ricky ran over to him. Ricky was a new Cobra who had with the gang only a few months. \"Excuse me Mr Kreese?\" he asks nervously. John turns to him. \"Excuse me boy when in this dojo you address me as Sensei is that understood?\" \"Oh yes Sensei, sorry Sensei.\" \"Well what do you want lad?\" Ricky nodded and looked at him. \"I was just wondering about your style of Karate?\" \"What about it?\" \"Well what type is it?\" Kreese frowns and looks at him confused. \"It's Karate that's what it is.\" Ricky nods an carries on nervously. \"Well yeah but theres loads of Karate isn't there. Shotokan, Kenpo, wado-ryu.\" Kreese thinks about this realising he actually had no idea about his style or anything to do with Karates history and this Ricky lad was obviously some kind of Karate nerd. \"What does it matter? If you're in a fight no ones going to give a shit about what labels you fight with.\" Ricky nods quickly. \"Yes Sensei sorry Sensei but I was just thinking we're Cobras right so maybe this is like Cobra style Karate. Like how Kung Fu uses animal styles this could be our style of Karate Kai.\" Kreese frowns at him. \"Karate Kai?\" \"Yeah that's the true name of Karate developed from Japan but here its been shortened to just Karate.\" Kreese nods. \"So you think this style should be called Cobra Karate Kai?\" Ricky thinks about it for a second then shakes his head. \"Nah that doesn't really work does it. But how about Cobra Kai Karate or just maybe Cobra Kai. What do you think?\" Kreese considers it then shakes his head. \"Nah that's lame.\" A few weeks later Kreese and a few men were planning a job. They wanted some solid cash so were planning an armed robbery on a jewellery store. Nothing fancy just run in get the cash and go. Kreese was addressing his crew for the job. \"Simple plan strike first strike hard go in get what we need get out. No one needs to get hurt not us or them. More than likely they won't put up much of a fight. It'll be easy work. Any questions?\" There was no response and in the following week Kreese and the 3 other Cobras park their getaway car next to the store. All men checked their weapons. 2 of them were using shotguns, another had a rifle. Kreese though had a preference for hand guns and was using a smith and western. \"Lets do this boys.\" Kreese spoke with confidence and they stepped out the vehicle and pulled masks over thei faces. They crash through the door. Kreese runs to the security guard and drops him with a quick elbow to the jaw. The 3 men cover the shop while Kreese moves over to the guy on the cash desk and puts his gun in his face. \"Very simple, you want to live hand over the money. Don't be a hero you don't get paid enough for that.\" The gang started gathering as much cash and jewellery off the crowd of people in the store when they heard police sirens in the distance. Obviously one of the workers hit the silent alarm. \"TIME TO MOVE BOYS.\" Kreese yelled out to the rest of the gang. With that they run out through the back of the shop to the fire exit into a back alleyway. Cops had surrounded their getaway car. Kreese quickly took control. \"Right guys split up and meet back at the base.\" They all ran in several directions. 3 cops chased after Kreese. One jumped in front of Kreese pointing his gun at him. \"Freeze hands in the air.\" The officer yelled at him. Kreese began to raise his arms like he was surrendering but as he did he seized hold of the gun stepped to his side away from the barrel and twisted the gun out of the cops hand then followed up with a right hand that knocked the man to the ground unconscious. He started to run again and got to a fence. Just before he could climb it another cop grabbed him from behind. Kreese twisted round and kneed him in the groin and followed up with an elbow to the head and threw him to the side. He then leapt to his side and side kicked another approaching cop in the chest sending him flying back into the wall. He then scaled the fence and dropped down on the other side. Suddenly 10 cops appeared from nowhere all pointing guns at him and yelling. Kreese knew he couldn't fight them all so simply dropped to his knees and put his hands behind his head. 2 cops ran at him and pinned him to the ground and put handcuffs on him and threw him into a police van. Kreese cursed himself. He'd failed and now was in deep trouble. The next few days were a blur to Kreese. When he'd arrived at the station his prints were taken and he was forced into a cell. He had then been interviewed and asked to give up the other Cobras involved in the robbery. But Kreese had refused to give up his crew. So he had been charged with armed robbery, possession of an illegal firearm and 3 counts of assault on a police officer. He was then taken to court for sentencing. He stared at the judge as he delivered his verdict. \"John Kreese, one week ago you took part in a robbery motivated purely by greed. You then assaulted 3 officers causing serious injury. You have not co-operated with the investigation and have offered no defence. Usually this crime would sentence you to 20 years in prison. But given the fact you are still a young man and are in good physical condition and in light of current circumstances we are willing to not put you in prison. Instead you will join the military and redeem yourself by fighting for your country in Vietnam. No appeal may be made against this.\" Kreese was stunned as he was led away. Sure he was happy to not be doing time but in no way did he want to join the military. But like everything else the choice was taken out of his hands. Kreese was kept under house arrest under he was due to be deployed for basic training. But on the last night he was allowed to have one night out on the strict orders I he didn't turn up he would be arrested and sentenced to life in prison. He had no intention of running. He knew he could probably call some contacts and get him some false papers to get out the country but he didn't want to spend forever looking over his shoulder. He walked into a bar he'd never been before to drown his sorrows. He'd considered contacting the Cobras but decided against it in case the cops were tailing him to catch them. He was sitting in the bar drinking a beer when a small Asian looking man sits next to him. The guy was way shorter than Kreese and less built and was losing his hair. Kreee glanced at the gu but didn't say anything. The man looks at him. \"You look like man who sentenced to death.\" The man says with a small laugh. Kreese looks at the guy and gives a small sarcastic laugh. \"In a way I have. I either join the army tomorrow or I spend the rest of my life in jail.\" The man nods thinking of this. \"You commit crime. Maybe army good way to restore honour.\" Kreese laughs and shakes his head. \"You sound like the damm judge. I don't need my honour restored. I couldn't give a dam about honour.\" The man nods. \"You young so no understand honour you think life about money, getting girls, getting power. But one day all that be gone and you left by yourself and if have no honour inside you be as good as dead.\" Kreese looks at him. \"Was I supposed to understand any of that crap.\" He looks at him and sees the man wearing an army uniform. \"Oh you're one of the armies bitches so of course you think fighting wars is good.\" The man shakes his head. \"War never good. No winner in any war. Even the winning side lose many men so how can be considered winners. Army teaches strength inner and outer.\" Kreese takes a large gulp of his beer and orders another before speaking. \"I don't need any of that I'm a black belt in karate I know all about strength.\" The man laughs. \"Ah you Karate student. You seem like man who has no true idea about Karate. You may know how to fight and hurt people but that's not the real Karate. Karate is about peace and balance. Not about winning war against others but winning war with yourself.\" Kreese rolls his eyes. \"You talk like some damm monk. You talk like you understand Karate. You're about 2 foot tall you'd get squashed on the streets. Okay you talk about peace and wars within. How has it helped you in that way?\" The man frowns and looks down. \"Wife and son died recently. I could have broken and destroyed myself and lost my war but my balance keep me going.\" Kreese nods slightly. \"Ah I'm sorry about your wife and kid.\" He raises his glass as if to toast them. \"Aye me to but you remember. War isn't good it changes people. But you can control what it turn you into. It could turn you into even more of a criminal or it can show you how lucky you truly are. Your choice.\" The man sees a group of soldiers wearing the same uniform as him at the door. \"I must go. Good luck, maybe one day we meet again.\" Kreese nods. \"Yeah see you round.\" The man stands and gives a small bow then walks to his men. The leader looks at him as the man salutes. \"Ready to leave Sergeant Miyagi?\" \"Aye sir, Miyagi ready.\" A/N: Hope everyone likes the new chapter. I know its been a while. Also hope people like the last part. I wasn't sure about it. But I like the idea of the 2 meeting before the movies. I always felt that Kreese did have a small bit of respect for miyagi in the first movie I could be wrong but I interpreted it that way so I put it in. It's the most fan service I've written in and If people don't like it well it won't be in anymore chapters but please review. I appreciate feedback.[Chapter 7] Despite his initial reluctance John Kreese took to army life better than anything he had ever done. He flew through basic training. His strength, stamina and aggression made him one of the top recruits. Also due to his time in the Cobras he already knew how to use a gun. After basic training he took part in a number of missions in Vietnam. He killed a number of enemies not with weapons but with his bare hands. His Karate was more lethal than any firearm. Also during that time he met up with a Korean master and spent a lot of time training with him. The master taught a lot kicking techniques and how to get more power and snap into his kicks. Kreese enjoyed having a sensei again since he hadn't had one since he'd shot Lung through the head. After a few years Kreese gained the rank of captain. One day he was assigned a new mission and was sent to a local military base to lead a new unit of soldiers into battle. He arrived at the base early one morning and a young soldier went to greet him. Upon seeing him gave Kreese a salute. \"Corporal Thompson sir. Pleasure to meet you.\" Kreese nodded and returned the salute. \"Thank you corporal. So what's the story around here?\" \"We have about 20 new recruits fresh off basic training. 2 corporals including myself so that makes you the CO here Captain.\" Kreese nods again. \"Okay fine let's have a look around then.\" The Corporal shows him around. Eventually they get to the exercise ground where a group of soldiers had made a circle and were cheering and yelling. \"What's going on over there? You guys got cock fighting round here?\" Kreese asks as they start to walk over. \"Yeah in a sense. Some of the guys like to take part in a few…sparring matches. The old CO didn't mind it but of course if it's an issue for you then it stops straight away captain.\" \"Nah all good. It's good for the troops to stay sharp with their skills. Lets see what these boys are made of.\" Kreese walked over and moved into the front of the crowd and saw 2 young men fighting in the centre of the circle. Both men were shirtless and had good muscular figures and were fighting hard eventually the fight ended up on the ground and one of them secured a choke on the other and the guy had no choice but to tap and he released the choke. Once done Kreese stepped into the centre and yelled out. \"ATTENTION\" All troops stopped cheering and stood to attention. \"These little fights you boy are having. It's good work but I'm very disappointed in what I saw in that last match. You boy what's your name?\" Kreese asked the guy who won the match. \"Jones sir, Private Jones.\" \"Well everyone jones here may have won that little match but guess what. If we were out in nam in the field he'd be dead. You know why? He was choking that punk but let him go when he tapped his hand. That's bullshit you gonna do that in a real fight? You let a choke go in the field you get a knife in the guts and I have to go tell your family that your dead because you were to weak. Now I don't want you lot killing each other in here. But choking someone out isn't going to kill them. You want to fight like this. I want to see real fighting. You got that ladies? \"YES SIR.\" They all roared. \"Good. This is war and in war there is no mercy. Right then lets have a little game in here. Last man standing. Winner stays on. I will start in the ring and here's the twist. If anyone beats me they get this.\" He removes his captains badge from his uniform and drops it on the floor. \"So who's first?\" Jones steps up first. Feeling pretty good over his last win. Kreese nods and they begin to fight each other. Jones rushes in with a basic attack. Kreese worked out quick the kid was a boxer as he kept flicking out the jab at him. Best way to beat a boxer. Kick his legs. Kreese fired a roundhouse straight into Jones leg. The force sent him crashing onto the dirt. Kreese jumped onto him and punched him 3 times in the face forcing him to roll onto his stomach to try and escape the blows. When he did that Kreese got him in the same choke Jones had previously used. Jones tried to tap but Kreese just whispered in his ear. \"No mercy\" He held on until he went unconscious. Once he was out he let go and signalled for a couple of men to carry him out the ring. \"Next\" Another guy steps in and takes the same boxing stance Jones had but this time he blocked Kreeses kick attack so he obviously had more training. Kreese blocked a hook punch and sent a right palm strike straight onto his nose knocking him back. Kreese used his dazed state to kick him with a front kick to the groin and then threw an elbow to the head which knocked him clean out. The next fight was more of the same but this one was obviously more scared to fight now and was very hesitant. Kreese finished him quick when he threw a lazy jab and Kreese countered with a parry with his left hand that went across Kreeses body then followed using the same hand to deliver a side hammer fist into his jaw and followed with a right cross which knocked him out. Kreese easily dispatched everyone who challenged him until the last challenger stepped up. Kreese nearly laughed. The guy was easily the youngest and smallest. He was very skinny and had short jet black hair. But as soon as the fight started the kid attacked with punches and kicks there was no skill to the kicks but he was aggressive. Kreese countered all of the attacks and then grabbed his shoulder and threw 2 knees into his stomach and followed by a knee to the head. The boy went down. Kreese expected it to be over but the kid got to his knees slowly. Kreese smirked and walked over to finish him off but as he got close the kid punched Kreese square in the groin and jumped up and punched him square on the jaw. Neither shot hurt him to bad but he moved back surprised. The kid was glaring and had fire in his eyes. \"No mercy captain.\" Kreese smirked and moved in and side kicked him in the chest then followed it with a roundhouse kick to the head and as the kid was stumbling back threw a spinning back kick into his stomach. The kid was nearly thrown out the ring from the force of the shots. Kreese smirked and turned to walk off but sensed something and glanced round and saw he was already back up in a fighting position. Kreese laughed. \"You're a stubborn little bastard aren't you? Not very smart though boy.\" \"In the field if I get dropped down and I stay on the floor I'm dead. At least if I'm on my feet I have a chance to survive.\" Kreese smirks at the comment. \"Okay then.\" The kids runs at Kreese again throwing sloppy punches. Kreese dodges them all and then returns with an elbow right onto his eye. Then hits with a palm strike onto his nose then head butts him twice. The kid fell forward and clinched up with Kreese. Kreese kneed him 3 times in the groin and the kid responded by sticking his fingers in Kreeses eye. Kreese yells out but then throws him over his shoulder and the kids lands hard in the dirt. Kreese mounts him and punches him about 10 times in the head full power then gets off him. Kreese had to hide an exasperated sigh when the kid still tries to get up. Kreese shakes his head and boots him hard in the stomach then again the head sending him down. Kreese steps back now. Afraid he'd killed the kid. But like clockwork the guy staggered up. Jesus Christ this son of a bitch can take a shot. Kreese thought to himself. The kids face was a bloody mess and his eyes were totally out of it but had his hands up ready to go. Kreese shakes his head and steps back. \"That's enough boy. We could do this all day you won't beat me you'll just keep taking a pounding until I put you down so hard you won't ever get up. Now fall in\" \"Yes Sir.\" The kid nods and steps back in line like he was totally fine. Kreese walks off with the corporal. \"Who was that kid?\" \"I don't know his name. He just joined us yesterday. I haven't had a chance to read his file but he doesn't look like much.\" \"And yet he lasted the longest against me. He's the only one who landed a punch on me.\" \"Yeah but to be fair Captain it was a cheap shot.\" \"There are no cheap shots in fighting Corporal. He took advantage of the situation. I expect nothing less from my unit.\" The next morning Kreese was up early for a run around the base. He passed the exercise ground and saw a smaller group of soldiers than yesterday in a circle. Obviously they wanted to get some rounds in early. Kreese walked over and couldn't believe it when he saw the kid from yesterday in the centre fighting. He was holding his own but still taking a beating. Kreese just left them to it. There was no training that day as Kreese was to take them on a mission that night so they had the day to rest. Kreese was doing a check-up of the base and was inspecting the gym. When he heard someone hitting the heavy bag and walked over and couldn't believe it when he saw the same kid hitting it. \"Hey boy.\" He quickly stopped and stood to attention. \"Yeah yeah at ease.\" The kid relaxed. \"Don't you ever stop. Or do you just getting hurt?\" The boy shrugged. \"You may have seen I need the extra work captain.\" Kreese nods. \"Skill wise and strength wise sure. But from what I've seen there's no tougher son of a bitch here than you. What's your story?\" The kid sighs. \"I grew up in a rich family who didn't give a shit what I did. I used that money and got into some bad stuff. I was selling drugs and sometimes pissed people off so I had to fight a lot. Ended up I made to many enemies I couldn't stay at home so I took all the money I could and tried to set up my own private team but it didn't work out so I had to fight for myself. I learnt some Karate and boxing out some books and it helped a bit but wherever I went they found me.\" \"And that's why you joined up?\" \"Yeah I figured they wouldn't find me in Vietnam and if they did at least I'd know how to kill and have some tough guys to back me up.\" Kreese nods. \"Well I tell you what. You have the eyes of a Cobra. You probably don't know what that means but I have never met anyone with that much determination. Now your skill is garbage but with my help I can make you a killer. You'll be a fully lethal weapon. Do you want me to train you?\" \"Yes sir.\" He says very quickly. \"Well then what's your name boy?\" \"Silver sir. Private Terry Silver.\" \"Well then Terry Silver. Lets make you a Cobra.\" A/N: Please review. ","Summary":" \"HEY GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT\" The store owner screamed at the young skinny boy who had just"},{"Movie":"Karate Kid","Title":"Daniel's Fight For Survival","Author":"Loz Abi","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12951731","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is based (sort of) on one of my favourite films and sports. I apologise it if is quite short, I haven't got the hang of long chapters/stories yet. Daniel's fight for survival I can't stop. I just can't. I'm fascinated. Don't know what it is about it but I just can't help it. It's been a week. Every night at about 7pm I go and watch. They don't know I am there. I stand in the background just watching them. I recognise some of them, they go to my school. They are part of the \"cool gang\". The gang that kids like me envy. I'm just the shy kid with a few friends, nice friends though but there is something about these guys. I'm not sure what it is. Is it confidence I don't know? Every evening I tell my mum that I am going for a walk but I head down here every day. It is the Cobra Kai Dojo. I first saw them when I walked past and was mesmerised. So now I stand at the back and watch, they don't know I am there, well they didn't until tonight. \"Well well well, look who it is, it's Daniel\". Everyone stops and turns, I feel myself going red, I'm not sure what to do or say. I stay silent for what seems like ages but is probably only a few seconds and I mumble \"sorry, sorry\" then run out. Well done Daniel, they went down well. I arrive at school in the morning, I knew I would walk into one of them. \"So Danny did you like what you saw last night\" then he walks past and knocks straight in to me. I lose my balance but don't say anything ,I just get up. I arrive home greeted by my mum. I don't go out tonight and my mum notices why I haven't. \"You ok Daniel, you not going out tonight\". I pretend I don't hear her so I carry on turning the TV over with the remote putting the volume up as I do. \"Daniel, Daniel, you ok\". I look at my mum, I feel bad now as she looks concerned. I really want to do karate I've been doing some research in the library at school. I know that each move represents a self defence move. I tell my mum where I have been going. She looks shocked. \"Daniel, if I could afford it I would send you there you know that\" she says with sadness in her voice. I nod then head off to bed. Each evening I practice some moves that I saw in the book, there is a lot to take in and I soon realise it takes a lot of concentration to master each move but if I am to do this then I need further help. Little did I realise that further help would come sooner than I thought by one of the oldest and wisest men in the village named Mr Miyagi. I met Mr Miyagi whilst going to do an errand on behalf of my mum. My mum normally would do an errand but on this occasion she was unwell so asked me to do it. I arrived at his house. He was unaware I was there but I watched him. I watched him performing the same karate moves I had seen at the Cobra Kai Dojo but done more slowly, more elegantly. I watched in awe. I attempted to mimic his movements but however I was not quite as graceful and fell, twisting my ankle as I did so. Mr Miyagi turned to look at me, amused at the sight of me on the floor. He came over and greeted me with a bow, obviously aware of who I was. He invited me in and explained the techniques of the different katas of karate. At this point I knew I had to try it. I mentioned my dilemma of joining the Cobra Kai Dojo. At this point I became aware that there was some ill feeling between them and Mr Miyagi. \"Can you show me how to do it please\" I asked. Mr Miyagi hesitated before replying \"I will Daniel but you must watch and learn and concentrate as it is not an easy skill to learn. To become a black belt in karate requires dedication, integrity, honesty, motivation and other skills not everyone has. It takes time, it is not something that can be learnt overnight and it requires willpower when you think you can no longer do it\". I thanked Mr Miyagi and left to go home. I spoke to my mum and explained what I had agreed to do. My first karate lesson was planned for sunrise the following morning. I didn't sleep, I was excited but nervous. I met with Mr Miyagi and he showed me the basics. We continued to meet in the mornings and evenings, I didn't realise how hard it could be but knew what was meant by dedication. It was a couple of weeks later whilst walking to school that I became aware that I was being followed. I glanced round and spotted some of the lads from the karate class. They walked faster until they were right behind me. I felt my heart beating faster the nearer they became. I paused, I didn't want to walk faster and appear that I was scared of them so I waited for the inevitable to happen. \"New boy, saw you on the beach with the old man, think you know karate do you\", then he punched me hard on the arm. I didn't retaliate, there were more of them than me. \"Show us what you are made of, we want to see\". I had no intention of using karate for fighting but by now was aware of the self defences moves I had been taught. For months and months they continually harassed me, wanting to fight me. By now my confidence had improved, but I didn't want to fight them. It was on a night out with my girlfriend that I became aware I was being followed yet again. This time they weren't going to take no for an answer, they hit my girlfriend, they hit me and said they would continue until I agreed to enter the tournament. I agreed, didn't have a choice. I spent the next few months training harder than I ever could. I knew I would never win such a tournament but knew that I could try. My girlfriend Ali, supported me, helped me train but tried and tried to get me to drop out. The day of the match arrives. My first opponent is Tommy. This was an easy match which I won. My second opponent was Bobby. Bobby was much better than Tommy, more experienced, more aggressive. I knew I would have to work really hard to beat him. The match took forever to complete, I was becoming tired. The crowd were cheering for Bobby but in the distance I could hear Ali cheering for me. Spurned on by her voice I concentrated, really concentrated on what his flaws were. I knew I could beat him and I did. My next opponent was Dutch. Dutch is the mouthy one of the group. By this time I had no energy, knew I could never win. I attempted a back kick, he grabbed my leg and put me to the floor then it all went black …..[Chapter 2] i wake up and I don't know where I am. I am surrounded by bright lights and voices I do not recognise. I hear someone call my name. My eyes close again, but I'm sure I can hear my name being called. The next voice I recognise is my mum's. It sounds like my mum but very shaky. I force my eyes to open again and I see my mum smiling down at me. I manage a smile, aware that everything hurts. My mum explains how I took a fall, twisted my back and was knocked unconscious. I am aware I have other injuries and my mum tells me not to move. 'Daniel, you have broken ribs and a lot of internal bruising'. I know what my mum is going to say next but I don't want to hear it. I am all she has, her only child. I wait for her to say the words. 'Promise me no more karate'. I am lying here in pain, I can see the fear on her face and I know I should just agree with her but something inside of me wants to carry on, to finish what has been started. 'Mum, let's not talk about this, just let me get home' I say. She goes to speak but changes her mind, not sure of what to say. i am discharged from hospital the following day. Mr Miyagi arrives along with my mum and he helps me to his car. He doesn't mention the tournament or my injuries. We arrive home and my mum is fussing over me. I am planning on returning to school tomorrow, I need to get my fitness back up, I want to carry on. The next tournament is in three months time. I don't tell my mum what I am planning to do but I need to ask Mr Miyagi for it is he who will prepare me physically and mentally for it. I walk into school, holding hands with Ali. I am aware that Bobby, one of the lads that I fought with likes her. He is trying to make me jealous. He is making fun of me, but I know I am not to retaliate. Everyone knows there is always a mouthy person in any group. I know he is scared of me and I know if I retaliate then he will back down. Because of my injuries I won't do anything as I don't want to make them worse so I ignore him. Ali squeezes my hand as we walk into school, whispering for me to ignore him. I arrive at Mr Miyagi's house. I am fascinated by his house as well as his cars. He is good company , and also very wise, not like the idiots I face every day in school. There is a lot that can be learnt from the older generation. I am mesmerised by his life now and both when he was younger. His skills as a Sensei are phenomenal. I know my time to mention training for the next tournament isn't now but he is aware I think that it is something I want to do. He mentions my injuries and I shake my head to confirm I am ok. However my body language doesn't want to agree and he can tell I am in severe pain. I know what he is going to say. 'Daniel, son, karate can be used as a self defence should it ever be required. Tournaments don't prove anything. Just enjoy the learning of the new techniques'. I go to speak but I'm not sure how to word it. For now, I will go over the moves I have been taught and I will complete the application form to enter the tournament, I have started and I want to finish it. I just need to persuade him to help me .[Chapter 3] just before I start on this chapter, here are a few facts about me - I have been doing karate for 20 months, at my club it will take 5 years to go from white to black belt. Almost half of all white belts will quit before they get to orange belt. I am a Sempai, I help teach 5-7 year olds, I am currently training for my next grading in a month's time. I go karate 3-4 times a week its been a month since my last tournament, the injuries are healing. Mr Miyagi begrudgingly agreed to help me with improving my karate skills. I have been doing it again, I have been going to the Cobra Kai Club. If I need to beat them then I need to know what they are capable of. They are bigger physically than I am and although the karate moves they are doing appear similar to what I have been doing, theirs are done with more force or is it passion? Some of those guys mean business and if is obvious now that to them it is not just a sport. My mum doesn't know that I still want to carry on. My girlfriend isn't too impressed either but nevertheless she has agreed to support me and has been visiting Mr Miyagi with me, as when he is not around I need someone to practice with but not practice on. Little did I realise I would get myself into more trouble again ... As well as practising the karate moves and the meaning behind each one, Mr Miyagi has said that in order for me to perform each move well I need to know what each what can do in terms of helping me. Just a simple movement of the hand can be a block or a punch, without the other opponent knowing. Well it would be if i wasn't up against some of the hardest kids in town. ali had been round at mine doing homework. It was getting late and I'm a gentlemen and gentleman walk ladies home right? It's a warm humid night, we are laughing holding hands. There are couples out as well as kids enjoying the evening. Then we hear the cars and the shouting. It doesn't take a genius to work out who it is, but we don't say anything , don't want to draw attention to ourselves like they are doing. Whilst they are shouting from the car I'm hoping they hadn't noticed me, but I was wrong. 'Ali, come on, don't you want a real man not that big girl, I will show you what a real man is like'. Ali tells me to ignore as they are just trying to wind me up. I tell them to shut up which only antagonises them further. Then the car stops and they get out. Ali grabs my hand and tells me to ignore them once again. Bobby and Tommy are walking alongside us now. TOmmy starts playing with Ali's hair in an attempt to annoy me. I tell him to get off,I start pushing. Then Bobby starts punching at me. I'm aware that my ribs aren't enjoying this little fight and when Bobby says 'whoever wins the tournament gets the girl eh', I increase my kicks and kick Bobby square in the face. I can see that his nose is bleeding, but I don't see anything or remember, I think I hear Ali scream behind me and then ... Nothing ...[Chapter 4] If anyone should know then it's me, I should have looked behind me then I wouldn't be in this situation now. Ali is crying, I blacked out like I did at the tournament and it scared the life out of her. She calls out to ask someone to help. By now Bobby and Tommy have left as quickly as they arrived, high fiving each other as if they have done something amazing. I try to sit up and reassure Ali that I am fine. I'm not convincing her and my eye feels swollen. I get up to prove a point and have to hold on to her. 'Daniel, they are jerks and everytime you give them what they want, I've had enough now' she walks off in the direction of her home and I am not sure what she meant by this comment. She is walking too fast for me to catch her up so I shout that I will see her in the morning. when I arrive home, the lights are already off, I walk in and lock the door. My mum shouts to see if I walked Ali home safely and I reply I did, what else can I say? I don't like lying to my mum. I have never done it before. I go to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I'm not sure how I am going to sneak out of the house in the morning as I can see a black eye starting to appear. I grab a painkiller and a glass of water and head to my bedroom to undress. My side is sore and appears grazed, no bruises yet. I climb into bed and toss and turn for some time, not sure if it because of what Ali said, or the fight or the injuries. The alarm goes off and I feel like I haven't slept. The sun is beaming through my curtains which means I can put my sunglasses on in the hope that my mum doesn't suspect anything. This idea came to me during the night, I just need to find them. My mum calls my name and I shout I will be down shortly. I locate my glasses and put them on. My eye is really black and I know my mum will see it sometime, hopefully not right now. 'Hi mum, I'm not going to have breakfast, I'm meeting Ali to walk to school'. I'm nearly out the door when she stops me. 'Daniel why are you wearing sunglasses in the house?'. I don't want to lie again and to be honest I hadn't really thought of an excuse for her asking me that, so I simply reply 'Gotta go, see you'. However, it didn't work, like most mum's they aren't stupid and the next thing I know is she is standing next to me removing the sunglasses. I see that look on her face. The one I saw at the hospital, of pure horror. 'What happened' she asks. I don't want to lie and they were enough people around that would probably love to tell her so I said 'it's nothing I got into a fight'. She is touching my face, and even though she is being gentle, it hurts. 'Daniel what has gotten in to you'. This isn't like you, you never got into fights before. I feel bad for her, but I have to go to school so I say 'mum we will talk later, love you' then I go. I see Ali walking in front of me. I call her name but she just turns and looks at me them carries on. She shouts to one of her friends in front of her and catches her up. It looks like I am in the bad books again. Lunch time arrives and I go to find Ali, she isn't in the usual place and I think now she is definitely avoiding me. All I can do is let her calm down. i make my way to mr Miyagi's house after school, he sees my black eye and shakes his head. I explain what happened last night and tell him that I want to do the tournament, I am more determined than ever. We talk for ages and eventually he agrees to help me. I try to ask why there is ill feeling between him and Cobra Kai but he won't tell me. I think it may involve a love interest from a long time ago but I won't ask any more. 'Daniel, I will help you train for this tournament but you must keep out of trouble '. I will help you become the best you can but you have to put in 100% effort. I thank Mr Miyagi so much, tomorrow morning we will start, I just need to tell my mum ...[Chapter 5] It's been six weeks since I got into that fight with Tommy and Bobby. Now they are constantly harassing me everywhere I go. My mum knows that I am going into the next tournament. She didn't speak to me for two days when I told her but she knows it's what I want to do. As for Ali, she's ok but I have promised I won't get into any fights with Dutch and his gang. I haven't been back to watch them but I think I know what I am up against and I don't like it. i watch them in school, going up to the shy kids and pushing them around, makes them look tough, well that's what they think. After all, anyone can do that, pick on someone they know won't defend themselves. They talk about the tournament when I am near them and how they are going to beat up 'the new boy to teach him a lesson.' I just ignore them, I know they are doing this to antagonise me. My karate is coming on well although I am not sure it is good enough to beat Dutch and his gang. I need to be more aggressive in my punches. I need to be at their level of karate in six weeks time and even I know that's impossible. There are so many self defence moves I know but so many I don't. I don't know their individual strengths and weaknesses. For some their punches might be better than their kicks. My back kick needs improving on, it's not as easy as it looks. This is where I need Mr Miyagi's expertise. 'Daniel no, you will twist your back if you don't do it properly', as he shows me for the hundredth time. 'I can't do it' I say and walk off. I explain that I am worried about being up against Dutch and his gang. I look at Mr Miyagi's face, I think he is up to something, he doesn't give much away. I turn back to look at Mr Miyagi, he is doing the back kicks perfect, these are my weakness as I need to be able to see all around me if I am to win any of the fights. I need to take my opponent by surprise. I walk back to Mr Miyagi and apologise for my outburst 'I'm sorry, I say. 'Daniel, you need all those things I told you before, it takes time and effort and concentration, you will do it, but I am going to see those boys and sort them out, then he walks off 'what, no you can\"t go to them, they will think I have snitched on them'. He carries on ignoring me, putting his hand up whenever I speak, then looks and smiles at me. i make my way home, I should really go and see Ali, but I don't think I would be good company tonight and it wouldn't be fair for me to take my mood out on her and now I am worried what Mr Miyagi will say when he enters Cobra Kai Dojo. I know they don't like him like he doesn't like them but somehow I think things are going to get much worse ...[Chapter 6] I apologise now that this is a short chapter! I've been busy with practising for my grading as well as an acting show and dance show I've got coming up in the next week. Thanks to everyone that has taken the time to read my stories and please feel free to comment on what I can improve on, :) I didn't sleep much last night. I have a feeling Mr Miyagi is going to make things so much worse. I'm not really sure how worse they can get. I get knocked about by Dutch and his gang every day. Nothing obvious just a little push here and there but I never seem to be aware where they are and it happens when I'm not expecting it. mr Miyagi enters the Cobra Kai Dojo, and all eyes are on him. He's not intimidated by this bunch of idiots, bullies that's all they are and everyone knows bullies are basically cowards right? Ever come across a real bully, one that would go up to you on their own and have a go, nope they don't exist. 'Well well well if it isn't the old man, who sent you, that little brat you are babysitting?'. Everyone laughs except Mr Miyagi, aware that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit and only used by idiots not bright enough to say something intelligent. 'Leave the boy alone, if you think you are tough men show us what you are made of at the competition'. If you insist on fighting do it fairly at the competition. Only a coward would go out of his way to pick on an innocent kid minding their own business'. The Sensei tells his boys to be quiet, aware that he should know better as it is him they look up to and he needs to show that he has some control over them. 'you will get no more trouble off my boys' says the Sensei. His boys look at him confused by this but he gives them a look that says not to argue with him. 'thank you' replies Mr Miyagi as he walks off. Daniel arrives at Mr Miyagi's house later that day to tell him of his day in school. Excited that for once he has been left alone. 'Was this down to you, did you say something ' Daniel asks. mr Miyagi nods his head in agreement. Daniel shakes his head but My Miyagi says Daniel son, I told them no more trouble, now we only have a couple of more days for you to practice, stop talking and show me your back kick' Daniel did as he said. He has been practising this, and knows that practice does make perfect, his back kick is stronger and higher, Mr Miyagi is pleased to see that indeed his hard work has paid off. However, there is still a lot to do in such a short time if he is to beat Dutch. daniel is starting to feel nervous. He has been up against these lads before, he knows what they are capable of and more. He knows they train seven nights and they are a lot bigger than him. He is tempted to go and watch them again but it's probably not a good idea especially if he sees that they have improved as much as he has. Nerves are kicking in now and he is not sure he can do this. Now it is Ali's turn to tell him he can do it. Even his mum is behind him. Daniel thinks a lot and is aware this time last year he didn't know anything about karate. Once you start something like that it becomes an addiction. You become keen to progress and learn as much as you can, no Daniel you can do this, as he gives himself a talking to. We have three days to the competition and I'm going to do it. Let's hope nothing goes wrong he whispers to himself[Chapter 7] I apologise that I haven't put a chapter on in a couple of weeks. I have been busy practising for my karate grading which I passed today . We don't do tournaments like i have written about here. We have one progress test a month and on the third month we do our grading. For our gradings we have to do two self defence moves, kata, basic combination, shukokai and sparring. It's approximately 16 hours until the tournament starts. Not that I'm clock watching, thought Daniel. Ok maybe I am. Just that second My Miyagi pushes me over. I wasn't concentrating, and that's what happens when you don't concentrate, your opponent takes the lead. 'i didnt see' I say to Mr Miyagi, in a tone of voice which says I'm tired and shouldn't take it out on the person that has given up his time to help me. 'Daniel, that is no excuse, we have worked together for this tournament, you should have seen it. What you need is to practice your self defence on different people of different sizes. In life you never know who you might be up against. The skinny lad you think you can argue back with could be a black belt who has practised self defence on lots of different sempais. No two people are shaped the same or will have the same strength. Why do you think people that go to a karate club are taught by various different people? This is the reason why. 'Where am I going to find people to practice on? I have no friends here which is why I am in this mess'. Mr Miyagi nods his head and walks off. i feel guilty, I have expected this one person to help me be something in less than half the time it takes other people. I have not been doing karate for as long as Dutch and his friends, I know that and so do they. 'mr Miyagi, I'm sorry'. 'No apology Daniel, you go home and rest for tomorrow, be here at 6am to practice some more. I agree , than I walk off. as it is warm I decide not to go home. Before I realise it I am heading towards Ali's house, just the thought of her name brings a smile to my face. I decide to surprise her and head to her house. I knock on the door and her mum answers. She tells me Ali isn't well and has gone to bed. I apologise for disturbing her and go to walk away. I look up at her room and see her bedroom light is on. Out of the corner of my eye I see a shadow by the curtains. I stop for a minute but don't see anything, convincing myself it was my imagination. i walk the opposite direction to my house. The area I live in isn't as nice as Ali's and I have to walk through a couple of pathways where I see a couple arguing then a group of lads and girls further down being loud. Now I get what Mr Miyagi said about not knowing what someone is capable of because any one of these could attack me. Shut up Daniel I mutter to myself, you are tired just go home. it takes me twenty minutes to get home, it is now 9.30 and I creep in so I don't disturb my mum. I feel bad that I haven't spent much time with my mum since we moved here, once tomorrow is over I will spend more time with my mum and Ali, providing I don't end up in hospital like before. i head to bed and hope that tomorrow goes well. ","Summary":" This is based (sort of) on one of my favourite films and sports. I apologise it if is quite short, "},{"Movie":"Hansel & Gretel","Title":"Dust to Dust","Author":"Moore12","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11404591","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dust to Dust Part I Hansel sees it like this: if their lives were made into a fairytale one day, it would be Gretel's story. He's just along for the ride. It's another day, and they're in another town to hunt another witch (or two or ten, it's never just one). Hansel still feels a bit sluggish after his latest injection so he remains in the shadows as Gretel addresses the townspeople. If he believed in God, he'd thank Him for making this mob less unruly than the last one; he doesn't even have to threaten to blow anybody's brains out, and he almost always does because he will if anybody so much glances at Gretel the wrong way. Right after Gretel declares they will kill the witch terrorizing the town, a man barks, \"How do we know this bitch isn't the witch?\" Hansel tenses. If they won't respect his sister, he'll make them. In one smooth motion, he thrusts his gun towards the sky and fires. The shot, and the warning it carries, reverberates throughout the crowded square. As soon as every fearful eye is on him, he shifts the gun so it's trained on the townspeople. \"Alright, you've heard enough,\" Hansel orders calmly even as he stares them down from over the barrel of the gun with his most predatory look. The mob shifts backward, and he takes a step forward. \"And it's not your decision anyway so go home.\" Lucky for them, the townspeople are smart enough to listen the first time. Hansel stifles a yawn as he watches them disperse, unsettling the dust that coats their old, rundown town. The dust is everywhere; it was the first thing he noticed when he passed through the crumbling stone gate, and he can feel it in boots, his hair, even his teeth. He can already tell he'll be finding dust in his clothes for weeks after this excursion, and he's tempted to demand double their usual rate for it. Hansel is torn from his plotting when he hears the latest mayor who hired them, an older man with the pudgy cheeks he always resents because it's a sign he has wealth they can only dream of, tell Gretel it hasn't rained in moons. \"That is why we sought you and your brother's services,\" the mayor says, and Hansel almost snorts at his affected accent. \"We believe a witch is behind this drought, and we cannot afford to lose our harvest.\" Hansel bites back his retort that it looks like he can afford to lose a pound (or ten) and lets Gretel continue to take the lead. \"And we'll do everything in our power to make sure that doesn't happen. Can we discuss your leads over a meal? My brother and I have,\" — she pauses and looks to Hansel, and he shakes his head 'no' ever so slightly — \"we shouldn't discuss these matters in public.\" \"But of course,\" the mayor replies, and they turn to go. Hansel follows, trailing a step behind, his gun flung over his shoulder. As he walks, he regards his surroundings suspiciously, all the while keeping an eye on Gretel's back. He's learned the hard way—from the sheriff of Augsburg, the clergyman from Berlin, the mob in Trier, among many, many others—witches aren't the only evil in the world. When they reach the tavern, the mayor takes them upstairs to a private room. Hansel fights the urge to slump into a chair and throw his aching, blistered feet up on the table; instead, he takes the stool in the corner, moves his gun into his lap and leans back against the wall. For a second, he lets his eyes fall shut, and he can't help but breathe a shuddering sigh of relief as the warmth and the smell of ale and cooking meats wash over him. He catches a fragment of Gretel and the mayor's conversation, something about hunters being lured over a cliff, but he's already starting to drift, his taxed body rebelling against his just-as-weary mind. \"Hansel.\" Gretel's sharp voice brings him back to the present. He blinks open his eyes in time to see her turn to the mayor, her smile tight. \"Mayor Adler, I apologize for my brother. It was…we traveled a long way in a short time to get to your town. I promise he won't need long to recover.\" The mayor nods slowly, clearly unconvinced. Hansel forces himself to sit up straighter when his eyes turn to him. They need this job. It's been too long since the last one. Just when Gretel looks like she's about to resort to begging, the mayor turns back to her and says, his voice almost, but not quite, kind, \"I will go have Josef prepare you two a meal. Once I return, we will discuss the terms of our deal.\" The moment the door slams shut behind the mayor, Gretel stalks over to Hansel and grabs him by the shoulders. \"What the fuck were you doing?\" she hisses in his face, her bloodshot eyes filled with unchecked rage. He ducks his head, unable to meet his sister's gaze. \"Now he knows we're fucking desperate, and I bet we'll get the old 'do the job for food and lodging' deal.\" Hansel doesn't know what else to say but sorry. \"Sorry, Gretel, I…\" He trails off when he finds he has no excuse to give and finally just shakes his head. Gretel doesn't fill the resulting silence, and Hansel doesn't break it when she lets go of his shoulders and walks away. After watching her sit down at the table and press the heel of her palm against her temple, he clambers to his feet, ignoring how unsteady his legs are, and joins her. He reaches over and gives her free hand a gentle squeeze. She doesn't acknowledge it, or him, but that doesn't matter. She understands. She has to. Hansel lets go of her hand when he hears the door swings open. The mayor is back, and he actually kept his promise. Hansel can already feel his mouth starting to water, and he almost makes a wild grab at the food; somehow, he manages to wait to dig in until after the tavern girl sets the platter on the table, the mayor sits down across from them and his sister takes a slice of bread and a choice cut of meat. While they eat (Hansel knows better than to stuff himself, but he can't help it and goes back for seconds and then thirds), the mayor and Gretel talk about the rumors that the witch's lair is at the bottom of the cliff. Hansel doesn't like the sound of that, and he's about to say that scaling cliffs costs extra when the mayor's eyes turn cold and he says, \"As for the terms of our deal, I will secure lodging at the inn for you during the duration of your time here, and,\" — his gaze comes to rest on Hansel, who suddenly feels the need to wipe his mouth with his sleeve — \"I will tell Josef to put all your meals on my tab. I assume that will more than suffice for killing one witch.\" Gretel looks like she's about to argue (or break the mayor's nose); thankfully, she settles for kneeing Hansel under the table, right in his pincushion of a thigh too. He knows he deserved it so he just bites his lip to keep from yelping (and messing things up more than he already has). After Gretel collects herself, she replies evenly, \"Mayor Adler, from what you've told us, I don't think we're dealing with a run-of-the-mill witch here. Usually, we make towns pay double for witches like yours. But, because I'm in a good mood and you've been so very kind,\" — Hansel can't help but smirk at the biting sarcasm barely concealed in his sister's tone — \"we'll only require you pay our usual rate, half upfront, half after we kill the fucking bitch.\" The mayor smiles and nods in response. Hansel's stomach plummets when that smile slowly twists into a smirk. \"I do not believe you are in a position to refuse my offer. From what I have heard, the witch hunting business has not been kind since Trier. And, based on your brother's condition, I suspect the rumors are true.\" They are. Fuck, they are. But Hansel doesn't say that. Instead, he lurches to his feet and grabs Gretel by the arm. \"Come on, sis,\" he says gruffly, pointedly not sparing the mayor as much as a glance. \"Let's get outta this shithole.\" \"You said it, bro,\" Gretel agrees as she loudly pushes her chair back and gets up. Then, clearly on an impulse, she pulls their money bag out of the inner pocket of her coat, retrieves a few coins and hurls them onto the table. Hansel flinches, hoping they'll still have enough for his medicine if this ploy doesn't work. \"There. Now we don't owe you a damn thing.\" With that, as one, almost as it was before, they turn for the door. Gretel is the very picture of defiance, and Hansel does his best to match her, holding his head high, doing his best to hide his limp. Right when he starts to push open the door, the mayor calls, the defeat in his voice enough to make Hansel break into a rare grin, \"Alright, fine. I will pay your usual rate. But no more.\" \"We'll need all the money up front to make sure you don't try to cheat us,\" Gretel snaps without turning around. The mayor starts to say something, but she quickly cuts him off, her voice as sharp and final as her favorite knife, \"And before you even think about arguing, Mayor Adler, I'm sure you've heard the rumors about what happened to the last mayor who crossed us.\" Hansel gingerly shifts his weight to his left leg, hoping the mayor didn't notice. While he knows they're in the position of power right now, he wasn't planning on pushing their luck so far (even half their usual rate would have been enough for him). But he's not surprised when the mayor sighs heavily and concedes, \"Fine, I will agree to those terms.\" He pauses for a moment before adding, his voice dangerously calm, \"However, if you fail to kill the witch, understand I will send the sheriff and his men after you. And I do not believe your brother is able to run.\" Gretel swivels around and gazes at the mayor levelly. \"We will kill your witch. And, if you threaten my brother one more time, I will fucking kill you too.\" A/N: Thanks for reading! As you probably guessed, this is set years after Hansel & Gretel Witch Hunters . I only watched the movie because I found it in the $3.75 bin at Wal-Mart and I really enjoyed Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton. When his Hansel was almost identical to Clint, I fell in love with this movie too. It's so bad, it's good! Oh, for the record, I write Hansel and Gretel as very close siblings. There will be absolutely NO incest in this story (I just wanted to be clear on this point because, in the fandom, incest comes up a fair amount). Anyway, this is probably going to be one or three more chapters so please let me know what you think. Getting reviews, favorites and follows really motivates me to keep writing, and I truly appreciate them. Until next time. ~Moore12[Chapter 2] Dust to Dust Part II Gretel sees it like this: their stories are so tightly intertwined they can't possibly be separated. They don't have their own stories, only their shared story. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" Hansel says, his voice only tired, not the slightest frustrated or angry. Gretel watches as he walks over to the desk in the corner, clearly trying to hide his limp for no apparent reason, and then leans against it. \"It's not like we're not gonna kill the witch.\" \"I know that,\" Gretel replies, placing her hands on her hips, but Hansel's watch starts whirring and clicking before she can continue. For once, he doesn't turn away from her while he takes his injection, and she waits as he pulls a syringe from the pouch on his leg and plunges it into his thigh. His cracked lips scrunch into a grimace, but they change into a weak, lopsided smile so quickly, Gretel almost misses it. Once he's done, he settles back against the desk and looks at her expectantly, though his eyes lack their usual sparkle, so she heaves a sigh and continues, \"But it needed to be said. For fuck's sake, Hansel, what else did you want me to do?\" Hansel shakes his head slowly but doesn't say anything. His eyes grow distant, and Gretel can't tell if he's lost in thought or if he's about to doze off on her again. Then, he shakes his head a second time and mumbles, \"I dunno, sis, I just dunno. But I can take care of myself, alright? You know that, right?\" Gretel forces a smile. She can only hope he thinks it's genuine; he's always been the one who could hide what he was really thinking and feeling, not her. \"Of course I do, but that doesn't mean I can't have your back, does it? Besides, I know you would've done the same for me.\" \"Yeah, you're right, I would've,\" Hansel snorts and says, and Gretel can detect a hint of wistfulness in his quiet voice. It almost breaks her heart. \"Remember the time I almost shot off the Sheriff of Cassel's balls 'cause he tried to feel you up?\" \"You shouldn't have done that,\" Gretel answers mischievously, using Hansel's own words against him. When Hansel just rolls his eyes, she adds, \"I could've fucking lived without being chased by a pack of half-wild dogs out of town.\" \"Half-wild? Pretty sure they were wild,\" Hansel says, chuckling roughly. He looks like he's about to say more, and Gretel hopes he does because the only time she gets to see him smile or laugh or look like himself these days is when they talk about their past, but he doesn't; instead, he pushes himself off the desk with a low moan and makes his faltering way over to the wash basin on the other side of the room. Somehow, she resists the urge to help him. Gretel sits down on the edge of the bed and pretends to leaf through the maps Mayor Adler gave her while Hansel cleans his face and then shrugs off his coat and vest, letting them fall to the floor. His ripped, stained undershirt hangs off of him loosely; once, a long time ago, he used to complain incessantly it was too tight in his shoulders. After watching him kick off his boots and limp over to the window to draw the blinds, Gretel asks carefully, \"You're not going to sleep already, are you? I thought you'd want to go to the tavern with me so we can take full advantage of our unlimited free meals and drinks.\" \"'M sorry, sis,\" Hansel says as he drops to the ground beside the bed and sprawls out. This time, he grabs one of her discarded boots to use as his pillow. \"'M just tired.\" \"That's fine,\" Gretel replies gently before reaching down on an impulse to ruffle his hair. He cracks open one eye and gives her a look that says \"really?\" and she laughs before ruffling his hair again, which only makes him groan in protest. \"Good night, baby brother. See you bright and early in the morning.\" \"Hate mornin's,\" Hansel mutters blearily, letting his eye slip shut again. \"We oughta burn 'em.\" Forcing a laugh, Gretel gets to her feet, tiptoes around him and makes her way to the desk so she can study the maps without disturbing him. She doesn't mention he used to be the early riser of the two of them; whenever they stayed the night in a town, she'd wake up the next morning to find he had already gone to the market to replenish their supplies. Without fail, he always bought her a treat—an apple, a buchteln filled with jam, a chunk of chocolate. At first, Gretel teased him mercilessly about it, once even accusing him of trying to fatten her up like that old crone who started them on their path. Eventually, after she realized how happy it made him, she began to simply accept his gifts graciously. And that was just one of the many things Trier took from them. Gretel shudders as the memories she's been trying so hard to suppress start flooding her mind at the mere thought of Trier. She glances over her shoulder to reassure herself that Hansel's still there and can't help but smile sadly after looking him over. That's when she resolves to go to the market before he wakes up and get him a new shirt (or two, he'd lost or ruined all but the one he's wearing long ago) and something special. Since anything sweet is out of the question, she decides she'll try to find him Maultaschen. It's one of his favorite foods, and they haven't had it since Berlin (actually, they haven't had much of anything to eat besides what they could hunt or trap, but that's beside the point). When Gretel tires of looking over the maps, she decides to follow her brother's lead and turn in early for the night. She hadn't lied to Mayor Adler when she told him they had traveled a long way in a short time to reach his town, and she also knows she should sleep when she gets the chance. She doesn't bother to wash more than her face or even attempt to shake the dust from her clothes; the dust followed them inside anyway, and it coats the floor and every piece of furniture. Once she's settled in bed, she leans over and brushes her hand against Hansel's shoulder. He stirs, rolling into her touch, but doesn't wake, not even after she whispers, \"Sleep well, Hansel.\" Gretel closes her eyes and allows the darkness of sleep to claim her. And then the ugly yelling starts—people are screaming for someone to be burned—and her eyes snap open. She's back in that cursed square, being manhandled towards the stake, and she tries to scream herself but can't because she's been gagged. She can't accept she's going to die, not like this, not after she and Hansel dedicated their lives to saving the asses of pathetic fucking townspeople like this. She wishes she knew where her brother is, hopes (and will even pray if it will help him) he's safe, but she suddenly sees him out of the corner of her eye, lying in a heap a few feet from the stake, a pool of blood slowly building around him. She digs her feet into the ground, but the men are too strong for her, and she tries to scream again when, impossibly, Hansel lurches to his feet, pulling a pistol from his coat and firing a bullet directly through the sheriff's eye socket in one fluid motion. In seconds, everything descends into chaos, which Gretel plans on taking advantage of, but then there's a knife pressed firmly against her throat, close enough to send a dribble of blood trickling lazily down her neck, and… Gretel's eyes bolt open, and it takes a second for her to realize she's not in Trier (and now she couldn't be happier to be in this dusty shithole). Without thinking, she leans over, grabs Hansel by the shoulder and shakes him. She immediately regrets it when he lets out an ugly moan and his eyelids flutter open, revealing bloodshot, unfocused eyes. \"Gretel?\" he murmurs. \"You okay?\" Even though Gretel wants to tell Hansel to go back to sleep, she does owe him an explanation for waking him. And she does want to talk. \"I had this dream…about Trier. I was back in the square, and you were…\" She's not surprised when Hansel cuts her off, his voice slurred but still final. \"We don't talk about that.\" He's said that so many damn times about so many damn things—their parents, her being a witch, his relationship with Mina, Ben's death, Edward's capture, Trier. As the years have passed, Gretel has started to believe he does it more to protect himself than to protect her, and she wants to howl in frustration because, damn it, they need to talk about Trier. They also need to talk about the limp he can now barely hide, but that's a conversation for another time. After a brief moment of silence, Hansel surprises her. Instead of telling her to go back to sleep like he always does, he grabs her hand, giving it a tight, almost defiant squeeze, and drawls, \"If you keep lettin' it control your life, they win, sis. Don't let 'em fuckin' win.\" Gretel doesn't know what to say to that so she doesn't say anything. On some level, she knows her brother is right, but she doesn't want to admit because, the way she sees it, on another, far more important level, level, he's wrong. What happened in Trier altered the course of their lives forever, just like what happened in that fucking gingerbread house straight out of hell did. Before she knows what's she's doing, she blurts out, \"Hansel, they already won. The fucking bastards, they took…\" \"Hey…\" Hansel breaks in gently, and his grip on her hand tightens. When he continues, his voice is less than a whisper but still firm and so very certain. \"They didn't take everything, sis. You know that. We still got each other.\" A/N: Thanks for reading! I wasn't planning on writing from Gretel's POV when I started this story, but I decided to give it a shot and really enjoyed it. I think this story becomes more powerful when you get to see what Gretel thinks of her baby brother (yes, I decided to play Hansel as the younger of the twins just because I think that makes it a more interesting dynamic). As a quick reminder , I write Hansel and Gretel as very close siblings. There will be absolutely NO incest in this story (I just wanted to be clear on this point because, in the fandom, incest comes up a fair amount). This story hasn't been doing as well as I would have liked, but I'm assuming it's because I'm a little (or a lot) late to the party. If you like it, I would truly appreciate you giving it a review, favorite or follow. I truly appreciate all three. Until next time. ~Moore12[Chapter 3] Dust to Dust Part III They both see it like this: if one is lost, their story ends. They've unknowingly reached the same conclusion. Today's gonna be better than yesterday. Every single day since Trier, Hansel has told himself that upon waking. Today's gonna be better than yesterday—at once, it's the fragile hope that keeps him going, the promise he makes to himself even though he knows he can't keep it, the twisted lie his life has become. He silently repeats those words over and over and over as he trudges through the swirling dust towards the latest witch who's just begging to be burned. But, honestly, today's already better than yesterday (and almost every day that came before it too). Part of him knows Gretel shouldn't have wasted the money, but she really did manage to surprise him. The Maultaschen was so good, and he's irrationally thrilled he won't have to worry about salvaging his undershirt after this hunt. Hansel feels a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, and he lets it break free because, well, today's already better than yesterday. And maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will be even better, and things will go back to the way they were... Hansel is ripped from his thoughts by an inhuman scream. Beside him, Gretel tenses, clearly itching for a fight, but he just feels numb. The hunt lost its thrill many, many years ago. Even though he can't see more than a few feet in any direction because of the damn dust, he knows the witch is nearby. After shifting his gun off his shoulder and pointing its barrel out in front of him, he takes a hesitant step forward. When Gretel moves to do the same, he pushes her back with his elbow. Something doesn't feel right about this, and Hansel's about to tell his sister just that when there's a second scream, this one even more chilling than the last because it's right behind them. Hansel's instincts take over from there. He's not as fast or as strong as he once was, but he's smarter. Or, well, experience has taught him to think before he acts, and he applies that hard-learned lesson here, wheeling around immediately but not firing a shot until he sees something moving to his left. The shot is muffled by the relentless wind, but the howl of pain that follows reverberates for miles. It can't just end there, of course. That would be too easy. But, luckily for them, the wind starts to die down, steadily settling the dust back to the ground. Gretel spots the witch before he does and bolts after her with the reckless abandon that used to be his (not her) defining trait. He runs after her, gritting his teeth against the pain that pulses down his right leg every time his foot hammers the ground. Before he can catch up to his sister, she catches up to the witch; spurred on by panic, he breaks into a sprint when the witch abruptly turns and launches herself at Gretel, knocking her crossbow away with frightening ease. No, it can never be easy. Because that would be too damn easy. Hansel can't risk taking a shot, not with Gretel wrestling with the witch on the ground, both their hands clasped around a wand as sharp as any blade. He reacts without thinking (yes, he's smarter than he once was, but he still can't help putting himself between any threat and his sister) and tackles the witch, somehow managing to come up with her wand in mere seconds. And, with that, Hansel plunges the wand through the witch's neck. She screeches, but he knows how to shut her up and finishes her off in one well-practiced motion Almost immediately, the adrenaline coursing through him, which had driven him well past his limits, drains away, and he realize his chest is heaving, his vision has blurred around the edges, his hands are trembling. Despite all that, after sucking in a deep breath, he quips at Gretel, who had apparently rushed to his side, \"That was too fucking easy.\" Gretel offers him a hand up, and he takes it, both grateful and reluctant at once. As she pulls him to his feet, he chuckles to mask the groan he can feel building in the back of his throat and asks, \"Say, can we leave the head on the mayor's doorstep? That'll teach 'im not to fuck with…\" \"Hansel,\" Gretel interrupts, her voice so gentle, it puts Hansel on edge. He hates it when she uses that tone with him; he's not the one who needs protected, after all. \"Hansel, is your,\" — she hesitates, and he takes that as an opportunity to pull away from her and casually brush some of the dust from his coat, his way of saying, \"see, I'm okay\" — \"How's your…leg holding up?\" Not good. Fuck, it hurts. But Hansel quirks his lips into what's probably a grim parody of his once carefree grin and replies, \"It's good. My leg's,\" — a jolt of pain cuts him off; in response, he bites the inside of his lip hard enough to draw blood and shifts as much of his weight as he can to his left leg, which, of fucking course, draws an arched eyebrow from Gretel — \"Aw, fuck, sis, it hurts, but I'm okay, alright?\" What's left unsaid is he's okay because it always hurts and he's starting to learn to live with it (and he knows he will, one day, because he learned to live with his damn sugar sickness). He suspects Gretel already knows this, and he's relieved when she just says, \"Come on, baby brother, let's get back to town. I need a fucking drink.\" Hansel barks a laugh. \"I need ten. And I'm gonna get 'em 'cause the mayor's paying.\" Yeah, today's definitely better than yesterday. After only taking two rather half-hearted swigs, Hansel pushes his stein to the side, and Gretel can't help but frown. Of course, he notices; his eyes darken for a split second, but then he offers her a cheeky grin and asks, \"How 'bout the mayor's face when we dumped the head on his desk? Fuck, he looked like he was gonna piss himself.\" \"I think he actually did,\" Gretel chirps, earning her a rough chuckle that does nothing to assuage her concern. Something is wrong. But, when she continues, she acts like nothing is wrong, well aware her brother will retreat even further behind his sturdy(but slowly crumbling) walls if she lets on again she knows it. \"You know what? We should do that again on our next hunt.\" \"Yeah…\" Hansel tries for levity but fails, his voice falling off before he can complete a single word. The look on his face—mingled frustration, exhaustion, self-loathing and regret—is one Gretel's seen only once before, two and a half days after they escaped Trier, as he begged her to leave him on the side of the road when his legs finally couldn't carry him anymore. \"Gretel,\" he had whispered, clasping her face in his trembling hands, \"'M gonna slow you down. Go. Please.\" Gretel didn't listen (sometimes, late at night when she hears him mumbling in his sleep the same thing, she wonders if he'll ever forgive her for it). Looking at him now, his dull eyes trained on the table, his face drawn in a grimace, she remembers she may have saved his life, but she still lost him that horrible day on the side of the road from Trier to Luxembourg. \"Hansel…\" she reaches out and grabs one of his hands on an impulse, but he still doesn't meet her gaze. \"What's wrong? Please…please tell me.\" Hansel only pulls his hand out of her grasp, his eyes never leaving the table. Gretel waits for him to say something, anything, but he doesn't; instead, he pushes his chair out and shakily stands up, his hands balled into fists at his sides. \"Hansel,\" Gretel tries again, doing her best to hide her concern, her panic, but failing, \"Hansel, seriously, what's the matter?\" \"Jus' want some air,\" Hansel mutters under his breath seconds before his watch starts whirring and clicking. His mind is clearly elsewhere as he pulls a syringe from his pouch and plunges it into his thigh. When he's done, he blinks a few times to clear the fog that's settled in his eyes and then turns away from her. She's about to get up when he says, his voice low and hash, a tone he only uses when he means something to be an order, \"Need to be alone.\" Gretel doesn't follow him. Not at first, at least. She waits until she's finished her ale, and drank over half of his, before she hauls herself to her feet and traces the path her brother took, ignoring the wolfish stares of the men at the bar because she's better-armed than they are anyway. She assumed he returned to the inn so she's surprised to find him sitting on a discarded barrel on the outskirts of the market, his chin resting against his chest and his eyes closed. A girl who can't be more than seven years old approaches Hansel before she can, and Gretel holds her breath as she tugs on his sleeve and he starts, his hand tightening around his gun. But, the moment he opens his eyes and sees the girl, his expression softens. The girl says something Gretel can't quite make out, and her brother breaks into an uncharacteristically warm smile and replies, \"Aw, it's nothing. Jus' doing my job.\" Gretel can't help but smile herself when the girl produces a tiny, white wildflower from the pocket of her coat. When she holds it out to Hansel, his eyes widen in surprise, and he takes it carefully by the stem, as if afraid he'll accidentally crush it. \"Thank you,\" he finally says, his voice catching slightly. \"I really…\" \"Fern Ada, get back here now!\" Since Trier, Gretel has come to believe fear is the most powerful emotion, able to overpower love and compassion, harness anger and aggression, channel disgust and hatred. At some level, fear is behind every act of violence, justified or not. She's not immune to fear, and neither is her brother. But their fear is rational, unable to be preyed upon by rumors whispered in church pews, over ales, during marketplace negotiations because they've experienced the purest of evils. Part of her wants to intervene, but Gretel knows better than to try to fight Hansel's battles for him. So she watches mutely from the shadows as a man, who must be the girl's father, grabs her roughly by the hand and yanks her away from Hansel. \"You shouldn't be talkin' to the likes of 'im, Fern\" he spits, stepping between his daughter and Hansel even though his eyes betray he's very, very afraid of him, \"let alone be thankin' 'im.\" In the past, Hansel would have snorted and retorted something along the lines of \"the likes of me keep kids like her safe. So, yeah, she oughta thank me.\" But now he only mumbles, staring down at the flower he's holding between two fingers, \"You're right.\" He pauses before addressing the girl, who's peeking out from behind her father's leg with wide eyes, \"You oughta, uh, know better, but thank you, thanks again. I'm gonna…\" The man drags the girl away before Hansel can finish his thought, and he visibly deflates as he watches them go. Gretel doesn't wait long to walk over to him, grab him by the shoulder and tell him they should go back to the inn because it's getting late. In response, he smiles tightly and gets to his feet. As they walk to the inn, Gretel complains about the dust, mostly to keep from commenting on what she just witnessed without him knowing or on the flower, which Hansel has tucked behind his left ear. As soon as they're back in their room, Hansel limps over to the desk and sags against it. Gretel leans against the wall on the other side of the room, folding her arms across her chest expectantly when he finally notices she's watching him. After taking a shuddering sigh, he hangs his head and admits something Gretel never thought he would: \"I don't think I can do this anymore, sis.\" Thanks for reading! I have to admit, I've really, really enjoyed writing this story. I kind of think it's a little more realistic than the movie haha. I just wish it would get some more love than it has (though I know I'm late to the party). As a reminder, I write Hansel and Gretel as very close siblings. There will be absolutely NO incest in this story (I just wanted to be clear on this point because, in the fandom, incest comes up a fair amount). If you're reading this, I would LOVE to hear from you. I love getting reviews, favorites and follows, and this story hasn't been doing very well even though I think it's one of the better ones I've written. Until next time. ~Moore12[Chapter 4] Dust to Dust Part IV Just because part of Gretel always knew it was coming doesn't mean she's not blindsided by her brother's admission. She stares at him for a long, painful moment, struck mute because she can't find the right words to convince him that it's okay. They don't have to do this anymore—they don't owe anybody anything, they can open a tavern or buy a plot of land and farm, they deserve much, much more than this (and they always have). She wants to tell him all of this but doesn't get the chance. Instead, she's forced to watch helplessly as Hansel shatters; somehow, he still manages to hold back the tears brimming in his normally dull eyes, causing them to shine in a way they haven't in so long. \"I, uh, I'm sorry. Don't know what just, uh, got into me. Just tired or somethin' and I'll be alright in…\" \"Hansel,\" Gretel breaks in, her voice far sharper than she intended so she makes a concentrated effort to soften it when she continues, \"We don't have to keep doing this, not if you don't want to. And, since you're being honest with me,—\" Gretel hesitates, struck by the horrible realization he must be in so much more pain than she even suspected to have admitted this \"—I'm going to be honest with you. I've wanted out since Trier, and I…\" Hansel rarely raises his voice with her. Gretel can't remember the last time he did, but it was probably years ago, back when they were still cocky teenagers who naively thought it was better to be feared than respected. They had a few particularly vicious fights then, over how they'd spend their money, how much he drank, how she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself (and everything and anything in between). Eventually, after too many close calls to count, they stopped, neither willing to lose the other over a petty argument, neither willing to hurt the other more than they already had been. But he does now. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" he barks through gritted teeth, each word a pointed accusation in itself. She feels the anger, the frustration, rolling off of him in violent waves, and it terrifies her even though she knows he'd never do anything to hurt her. When she doesn't reply, he sighs heavily and slumps further against the desk. Then, he asks again, his voice impossibly small this time, \"Gretel, why?\" \"You know how you always try to protect me?\" Gretel begins with a question of her own, and she waits until he nods ever so slightly before continuing, \"I was trying to protect you. Let's face it: we don't talk about Trier because you don't want to talk about Trier. And, after Trier, as soon as you were able to walk, you wanted to get back to hunting. You wanted to act like nothing had happened, nothing had changed, so I let you.\" Hansel huffs an airy, bitter laugh. Then, he pulls the flower out from behind his ear and stares down at it intently, his eyes still shimmering with the tears he hasn't let fall. \"Yeah? So it's my fault then?\" \"I didn't say that,\" Gretel snaps, irrationally frustrated that, of everything he could have taken away from her confession, he came to that conclusion. She's aware, on some level, she shouldn't be surprised; she told him the truth, and she should have known the consequences of doing so. \"Yeah, you kind of did,\" Hansel mutters as he idly spins the flower between two fingers. \"You wanna know why I don't talk about Trier? All these years, I thought we were doing something good. We were helping people. And then…they treated us like the monsters we've been saving them from. It used to…before it didn't bother me what people said 'bout us. But…\" \"We're not what they thought we were,\" Gretel says gently, covering the distance between them in seconds and lifting his chin so he's forced to look her in the eyes. \"You know that, right?\" \"Sometimes, I'm not so sure,\" Hansel whispers, blinking furiously to fight back the tears that are starting to spill over. A few manage to, but he brushes them away before they have the chance to trickle down his face. \"Sometimes, I wish you jus' did what I tol' you to an'…\" He pauses to try to choke back a sob, but he can't. And, with that, the rest of the tears burst past his defenses, and Gretel is rendered speechless. She has never seen her brother cry, and she never wants to again. Not knowing what else to do, Gretel draws Hansel into a tight hug and lets him bury his face against her shoulder. As his violent sobbing racks his body, she reaches up and runs her fingers through his hair, ignoring the dust she unsettles. When he finally stills in her arms, she doesn't know how much time has passed, and she still doesn't know what to say. She doubts anything she says will make a difference, but she has to try. \"Hansel, you're my baby brother. I just, I-I couldn't leave you there, and you know you wouldn't have either if our situations were reversed. And…you told me just last night, 'If you keep letting it control your life, they win.' You know they were wrong about us. You know that. I know you do.\" Hansel only sniffles softly in response, and she pulls him closer, wishing she could do something to alleviate his pain even though she knows he won't let her. As soon as he repairs his crumbled walls (and he will, of that she's certain), this will become yet another thing they don't talk about. So they have to talk about it now. Just when Gretel's about to suggest they leave town tomorrow for Mannheim, where they can open the tavern she knows he's always wanted to, somebody starts pounding on the door to their room. They both tense, but neither moves until Mayor Adler shouts, his voice filled with murderous rage, \"Open up, witch hunters! A child has been taken!\" \"You can't expect us to go out there this close to nightfall,\" Gretel snarls, practically baring her teeth at the mayor like a cornered animal. Hansel can hear the fear in her voice, and he hopes the mayor didn't hear it too. Apparently, he did. As a cruel smile tugs at the corners of his lips, the mayor gestures to the sheriff and his men, and they quickly form a ragged circle around the witch hunters. In another time, and another place, Hansel wouldn't have been afraid of them. Now, he can barely keep his hands from shaking, and he curses himself silently for being so damn weak. After stepping just inside of the circle, the mayor replies, his tone as threatening as his cronies, if not more, \"That is exactly what I expect.\" \"And it will accomplish nothing,\" Gretel says through gritted teeth, and she presses closer to Hansel when the mayor's cronies begin to tighten their circle. He wants to find her hand, give it a squeeze to tell her somehow, someway, this will all work out, but he's frozen in place. \"Let me ask you something: if we go out there tonight, who will k-…\" Whir…click…click…click. Gretel's voice falls off at the sound of his watch. Hansel wants to wait, but he's already starting to feel lightheaded, and his watch keeps whirring and clicking, unaware (or not caring) that he has an audience. And every last person is watching him now; he can't help but mutter the vilest curse he knows under his breath as he pulls a syringe from his pouch and plunges it into his thigh in one fluid motion even though his hands have begun to shake. Once he's done, he straightens and then takes a single step towards the mayor. Lifting his chin and forcing himself to hold the man's cold gaze, he says curtly, \"What my sister was gonna say is this: if we die, who's gonna kill your fuckin' witch? 'Cause I dunno if any of these guys are up for it. I mean, if they were, why the fuck would you've hired us?\" For a moment, as the mayor stares at him blankly, Hansel is convinced they won. Just when he's about to assert they'll go first thing in the morning, and, of course, they'll do everything in their power to bring the child back alive, the mayor recovers and his smile becomes even more deadly than before. He turns to one of his cronies and says, \"Bring in the girl's mother and father.\" Hansel nearly drops to his knees when the girl's father walks in. Almost of its own accord, one of his hands reaches up and brushes against the flower he had tucked behind his ear right before the mayor and his cronies practically kicked their door down. He hardly notices the girl's mother is sobbing because he can only hear what her father said to him earlier that day: \"You shouldn't be talkin' to the likes of 'im.\" And, now, he wheels on Hansel and howls, \"This is all yer fault! My little Fern…the witch took 'er! What did you do to 'er?\" I'm sorry, Gretel, Hansel thinks as he's reduced to fighting back the tears he thought he had cried out earlier. But, somehow, by some miracle, his voice doesn't quiver when he turns to the mayor and says, more in response to the girl's father than to him, \"Get me a horse. I'll ride out now.\" \"Hansel, what the fuck are you doing?\" Gretel demands, and suddenly it's as if they're the only ones in the room. Her eyes are wild with all of the emotions she's been trying to hide since Trier, and he wants to wrap her in a hug and never let go, like she did for him earlier. But he can't. And he knows he may never again. \"The sun's going down right now. We're not going.\" Hansel gives her a smile. It's the very least he can do for her. \"You're right, sis, we're not. But I am.\" Thanks for reading! As you can probably tell, we're coming to the end of this story. I'm on the fence about how to end it, but I have a few ideas. I've really enjoyed writing this, but I'm a little sad that it hasn't gotten much love (thanks to everyone who reviewed, favorited and followed!). So, if you like it, let me know! I love hearing from you! Until next time. ~Moore12[Chapter 5] Dust to Dust Part V The horse spooks just as the sun starts to set, rearing up on its hind legs, pawing at the sky as if it holds everything it fears, not just swirling dust. It will, soon enough, so Hansel can't fault it, especially not when he can actually hear his own heart hammering. Tightening his hold on the reins, he manages to coax the horse into putting all four of its hoofs on the ground. Then, he gets it to stand still, but only long enough for him to dismount; the moment he's off of its back, it rears again, as if daring him to try to stop it, before charging back in the direction they came. Hansel doesn't watch it go. After setting his jaw and taking a deep breath through his nose, he flings his gun over his shoulder and continues to forge ahead, ignoring how quickly the sun is falling, how the moon is shining brighter and brighter until, just like that, it's the only light he has to guide him. The dust hanging in the air tints the moon a reddish orange, and he can't help but shudder, remembering the night when he almost lost his sister to a crazed coven that wanted to rip her heart from her chest and use it to live forever. His eyes are burning, but he blames it on the dust and keeps moving, reminding himself she's safe with every step he takes. She's not out here with him. She's back at the inn. She'll be able to handle the mayor and his cronies if they turn on her. Not that they will—they know they need her. They know, just like he does, he won't finish the job. Hansel tells herself Gretel will be able to. She's stronger than him, always has been, always will be, and she'll be fine without him. Maybe, without having him to worry about, she'll be able to reinvent herself. Maybe she'll buy a plot of land. Maybe she'll open an inn. Hell, maybe she'll get married and start a new family. Whatever she does, he hopes (and will even pray, if it will help) she's happy. After everything she's been through, she deserves happiness, and he's ready to lay down his life right here and now to make sure she has a chance at it (however slim it may be). He doesn't let himself consider Gretel might need him to be happy. The way he sees it, since Trier, he's been nothing but a burden. And he was supposed to protect her. When their father left them in the woods, he didn't say, \"Protect each other.\" No, he looked him right in the eyes and said, \"Protect your sister.\" Those words gave him his purpose—even though he's younger by just over a year, even though his life depends on injections, even though magic courses through her veins, not his, from that moment on, his life became about defending hers and nothing more. If Gretel knows he feels this way, she's never let on. Not even after Trier. It was Hansel's fault. If he hadn't snuck off with the tavern girl, he would have been there for her. The sheriff's son wouldn't have tried to have his way with her. She wouldn't have smashed in his nose with her stein. He wouldn't have rounded up his friends and chased her to the edge of town. She wouldn't have resorted to using a spell to fight them off. If Hansel had been there, her secret would still be safe, and they would have left that damn city in the morning for the next town and the next witch (or two or ten, because it can never be just one). But he wasn't there. And that, not his bleeding, broken leg, was the reason he wanted her to leave him on the side of the road between Trier and Luxembourg. She shouldn't have to protect him, especially not when he had failed her. Since then, that's all she's done, and he'll make sure that ends now because he can't live with… Hansel's torn from his bitter reflections by a sharp yelp of pain, and his heart plummets. He's too late, just like he was in Trier; when he returned to the tavern, Gretel was long gone, and he was ambushed before he had a chance to process what could have happened to her. Even though he knows better, and his leg protests every step, he breaks into a run when the cry is followed by a scream. Damn it, he won't be late again. He can't be. For the first time in too long, luck is on his side. Hansel arrives seconds before the witch, a particularly hideous creature with curved horns growing out of her head and eyes the color of blood, thrusts Fern onto a strange altar made of crumbling stone. \"Hey!\" he shouts, for lack of anything better to say, and she wheels on him and fires a spell. He smiles wanly when it passes right through him, as usual. \"Let the girl go, and I'll consider not killing you.\" The witch laughs, and Hansel bristles even though he's well aware he's not as intimidating as he once was. \"Where's your sister, dearie?\" she mocks in a cloying voice that reminds him of the candy the first witch force fed him. \"My invitation was meant for both of you.\" \"Ya don't say,\" Hansel quips in response as he edges a few steps closer to her. \"Well, you'll have to settle for jus' me. 'S nothin' personal so don't feel too…\" Magic may not work on him, but a dagger propelled by magic into his gut will do the trick. His knees buckle, his gun clatters to the ground, and he lets out a strangled cry that's quickly echoed by Fern and then drowned out by the witch's laughter. The world sways dangerously, but he slowly struggles to his feet. Not like this. He won't go like this. He has to save Fern. He can't fail her too. Fuck, why didn't he see the dagger coming? Why didn't he shoot the witch when he had the chance? Why wasn't he there? Why? Gretel, I'm sorry, he mouths, already too weak to ground out the words. He grits his teeth against the pain, thrusts a trembling hand against his wound and manages a step forward. And then another. And another. The dust has kicked up again, and he can barely see through it and the gray fog that's gathered at the corners of his vision. It doesn't matter. He still has a chance. He can tell the witch hasn't noticed his approach; no, she's clearly written him off for dead, and Fern is keeping her hands full by putting up quite the fight—kicking, scratching, thrashing, not willing to go calmly into the waiting arms of death. She reminds him of Gretel, and his sluggish heart catches in his throat. \"Stay still, darling,\" the witch growls as she draws back her wand. \"It won't hurt if you don't strug…\" Drawing on the last of his strength, Hansel pulls the knife from his gut and plunges it through the witch's neck. As soon as he severs her head, he collapses to the ground and curls in on himself, biting his lip hard enough to flood his mouth with blood to keep from screaming. Gretel, I'm so sorry, he thinks as he lets his eyes slip shut, welcoming the darkness like an old, trusted friend. The horse returns alone. Its eyes are wild, its coat glistening with sweat, and it takes the sheriff and all four of his men to subdue it. The moment they do, Gretel juts out her chin, strides over to them and grabs its reins. \"Are you fucking happy now?\" she snaps, her voice almost as sharp as the pang of grief she felt when she first heard the horse's hoofs clattering on the cobblestones. After the men look down at their feet in unison, she adds, \"You better pray he's alive. Because, if he isn't, you won't just answer to God.\" With that, Gretel climbs into the saddle and urges the horse forward with a snap of the reins. She doesn't spare a glance over her shoulder at the sheriff and his men, even though she feels their eyes on her back. They're the least of her concerns now (but, yes, she'll be true to her word, and they should be more afraid of her than Gold himself). Once she's passed under the crumbling stone gate, she digs her heels into the horse's sides to spur it into a gallop. Gretel tries to focus on the task at hand—finding her brother (not saving him, she can't let herself think he needs saved)—and not dwell on what happened to bring them to this. But she can't help it. At some level, as much as she never wanted to acknowledge it, let alone accept it, she always knew it would come to this. The longer she rides through the darkness and dust, guided only by the orange-hued moon, the more the flood of memories starts to overwhelm her. As she sees him curl up without complaint on the cold, hard ground beside her bed, watches as he lets her have the last precious drops of water from their canteen, catches a glimpse of him changing his blood- and sweat- stained bandages by firelight when he thought she was asleep, she curses herself for failing to make him understand he was important too. She tried; fuck, she tried, but nothing she said, not the gentle reminders, the teasing rebukes, the shouted reprimands, made any difference. In her mind, they were equals, far stronger together than apart, reliant on one another to survive in their cruel world. In his mind, she led and he followed, shouldering her burdens on top of his own way. After Trier, their burdens grew too heavy for him to carry on his own, but he became even more defiant in his insistence he bear each and every one. She knew he would collapse under their weight, but she hadn't tried hard enough to stop him and… Without warning, the horse skids to a halt, nearly pitching Gretel over its head. When it seems to realize she's still in the saddle, it begins to buck, and it's all she can do to keep it from bolting out from under her. \"No you don't, you fucking coward,\" she growls, pulling on the reins so hard, it whinnies in protest. \"I'm going to find my brother, and you're going to help whether…\" \"Help! Please!\" It's a girl's voice, high-pitched, filled with fear and oddly familiar. Gretel pulls up on the reins, forcing the horse to stand still as she waits for the voice to cut through the silence again. It could be a trap; she knows that all too well but doesn't care. \"Please! Help us!\" Fuck it, if it ends up being a trap, Gretel will let herself be hopelessly ensnared. For once, she's going to put Hansel first. She spots a short tree, bent by the relentless wind, on the horizon and directs the horse towards it. She dismounts only after she's tied its reins to a solid, low-hanging branch. The horse surprises her by not struggling, even though it could easily break free if it did, and she sighs softly in relief. If Hansel is injured (not dead, she can't let herself think he's gone), she'll need it to carry him back to town. \"Is somebody there? Please! Please help us!\" Gretel follows the voice until she finds them. The girl—Fern, she remembers right when she throws her arms around her right leg and begs her to save him—is alive. Hansel had kept his promise to her parents, but he had paid dearly to do so. As tears begin to cloud her vision, Gretel disentangles herself from Fern's grasp, sparing her a pat on the shoulder and a whispered \"it'll be alright\" even though it won't be, and then drops to her knees at her brother's side. She wants to bury his face against his shoulder and cry. She's too late, and he died alone and afraid (she hopes his death was quick and painless, but fate has never been kind to them in life so why would it be in death?). He's folded in on himself, his face turned away from her, and she gently maneuvers him onto his back and pulls his head into her lap. Choking back a sob—if he's watching, wherever he is, she doesn't want him to see her cry, not when he was always so strong for her, not when she suspects doing so would break him further even in death—she leans down to plant a kiss on his forehead. And that's when she feels it: a faint puff of air on her cheek. Gretel starts but recovers quickly, resting a hand on her brother's chest. She waits and waits and, just when she's starting to think she had imagined it, his chest rises. Before, she had ignored the blood, running hot and sticky down his right side, staining the dust around him a deep, dark shade of red. Now, she scrambles to find its source. It doesn't take long, and she can't help but gasp audibly. They've each had more than their fair share of injuries, and this one is worse than all of them, even the one that nearly took his leg, and then his life, in that tiny cavern between Trier and Luxembourg. The wound is too deep, and all she can do is press her hand against it and try to get him in town before he… \"'S bad, huh?\" There's blood in Hansel's smile. She watches, struck mute, as he manages to lift one hand and rest it on hers. After she takes it and gives it a squeeze, ignoring the blood trickling sluggishly through her fingers, she whispers, \"You look like shit, you know that?\" Hansel chuckles feebly. Gretel forces herself to hold his gaze even though her heart aches at the relief she sees in his glazed eyes. \"Yeah? 'S not been my best da-…\" An ugly, wet cough erupts from his lips, sending a trickle of blood dribbling down his chin. When he tries to continue, Gretel shushes him, wipes the blood from his mouth and draws him closer. As Gretel strokes Hansel's hair, hardly noticing it's sticky with sweat and blood, she begins to hum a song their mother used to sing. She may have long since forgotten the words, but the melody is as clear in her mind as it was the day she last heard it, nearly 20 years ago. Almost immediately, Hansel relaxes; his once brilliant blue eyes flutter shut, and the lines and creases that mar his face like the scars on his back ease away. She feels the tears welling up in her eyes—he looks so young and vulnerable, lying there in her arms and the dust, and she realizes she should have always been the one protecting him—but she doesn't let any fall. She only continues to hum, begging any higher power who may be listening to let him find peace wherever he goes next, to recognize he doesn't just deserve it; he's earned it. She's so lost in her frantic prayers, in the soft, lilting song she's humming, in the gentle rhythm of her fingers running through his hair, she doesn't realize her hands are glowing. By the time she's noticed, it's too late to call back the magic that's pulsing through her, just as it was when she unleashed the spell that snapped the sheriff's son's neck in Trier. She can only watch in mute horror as the light envelopes her brother. \"No, no, no,\" she whispers, clutching him even tighter even though she's source of the light. \"Damn it, no!\" The light burns brighter and brighter until, finally, she can't see anything. And then, in a flash she can physically feel, it's gone. When she finally manages to blink away her tears and the dark spots dancing on the corners of her vision, she realizes Hansel is looking up at her, his eyes wide with awe, and a little bit of fear. \"Gretel?\" he asks, his voice thick but not slurred anymore. \"Gretel…what did you do?\" Gretel doesn't answer because she doesn't honestly know. Instead, she hesitantly reaches down, not yet willing to believe what she already knows to be true. Sure enough, his wound has closed; the only trace of it is a thin, faint scar, the only reminder he all but died in her arms the blood staining his clothes and the ground. \"Hansel,\" she breathes, and she can't hold back her tears anymore. \"Hey,\" he whispers, pushing himself into a sitting position without any help and drawing her into a tight, almost fierce hug. She buries her face against his shoulder, as she's done so many times before, and she doesn't curse herself for her weakness when she realizes he's crying too. \"Hey, it's okay. I'm alright. I'm alright…Hey, say, do ya think we could open a tavern or somethin' now?\" Gretel can't help but laugh. And, suddenly, it's almost like it was before—before Trier, before Berlin, before even Augsburg, where they learned what she really was. \"I don't know, baby brother. I don't think I have enough patience for drunks, and I don't think we're allowed to burn 'em if they give us trouble.\" \"I'm sure we'll figure something out,\" Hansel says, a warm smile spreading across his still careworn face. With effort, he gets to his feet and brushes the dust from his jacket, though it does little good. Gretel pretends not to notice he's still limping when he walks over to where Fern is sitting on the ground, even when he lifts her onto his still shrunken shoulders and tells her she'll be home soon. As they slowly make their way back to town, Gretel watches the sun rise in the sky. And, in that moment, she realizes tomorrow won't be just another day. It'll be a new one. Well, that's the end of this story. Were you surprised? When I originally started writing it, it was supposed to be three parts and end with Hansel dying from not having enough medicine. So...yeah...it changed pretty dramatically. Anyway, I really hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I LOVED writing Hansel and Gretel. Yes, I'm well aware that Witch Hunters isn't exactly the deepest movie, but there's so much going on it's not hard to imagine them in this situation one day down the line. So, if you liked it, let me know! I love hearing what people think. I don't finish many stories that are longer than one shots (as you may have noticed) to this is a big deal for me. And I'd love to know if you liked the finished product. Until next time (whenever that may be). ~Moore12 ","Summary":" Dust to Dust Part I Hansel sees it like this: if their lives were made into a fairytale one day, it"},{"Movie":"Crimson Peak","Title":"A Dream Within A Nightmare","Author":"Accidental-Ducky","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11666394","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A great monstrous thing that will devour its host . At least, that was Kady's first thought upon seeing the house. It really was large compared to the houses back in the village two miles behind, made to Victorian standards and fully repaired. Her father had told her that it was nearly unsalvageable when he first found it, but he had quickly hired a whole team of workers to resurrect the thing. That's what it is, a thing, not a home . Beside her, Milo had come to a stop and was staring at the thing with the same disgust as Kady. \"Well,\" their father asks with a smile,\" what do you guys think?\" I think we should go back home, that we should sell this place, that we should get as far away as we possibly can . \"It's great,\" she says instead, knowing it didn't matter what she really thought. \"Yeah,\" Milo echoes,\" it's exactly how I imagined it.\" Their dad, August, stood proudly on the porch, hands planted on his hips and an excited gleam lighting up his hazel eyes. This was their adventure, the one they didn't get to go on until their mother had died. They were supposed to be in New Zealand, exploring Hobbit country and the mountains, but here they were instead—surrounded by dead trees and blood red snow. Crimson Peak, indeed . The clay beneath their feet turned the snow ruby red, a truly disturbing thing when you first spot it. \"Is the snow always that color?\" \"It's pretty creepy, Dad.\" The light in their father's eyes dimmed a bit at the criticism and he stares down at the ground as well. \"Well, that's just the clay coming up out of the ground,\" August answers. \"There used to be a huge mine under the land, but I made sure it was completely filled in to avoid one of you two falling in.\" And stop the house from sinking . From the pictures she had seen, the clay was coming up through what was left of the floor, what parts of it that hadn't rotted away. \"Come on in, guys!\" He was excited again, like a little boy at Christmas as he gestures at the teens. Sharing another look, Milo and Kady walked up the porch stairs and into the house, not expecting it to look much better than the outside. Most of the inside was made up of dark wood like the outside, a few colorful patterns appearing on the floor from where the sun shined through stained glass windows. Kady had to give it to her dad, the place really was beautiful no matter how much of a monster it reminded her of. All the doorways were arched and right across from her was an old fashioned elevator with a gilded gold cage around it instead of comforting metal and steel. Lift , she reminds herself , that's what they're called in England . Still, despite its beauty, it was cold as Frosty's right cheek inside and she was almost tempted to go sit in the car. Maybe if I threw myself on the ground and screamed, August would take us back to Oklahoma . She missed her state, where the trees were just beginning to change colors and the air didn't seem so heavy. Best of all, there wasn't any snow on the ground yet. Still, Kady manages a smile in her father's direction and she moves across the foyer to get a better look at the cage. That's really what it was, a rickety old bird cage with a lever inside to control which direction it went in. There were designs welded into the metal—because it's obviously metal now that she has a better look—that reminded her skating eights. \"Stay out of that,\" August warns,\" the workers couldn't get it working right and I don't want y'all getting hurt.\" Kady takes two quick steps backwards, half-expecting it to gobble her up. \"The stairs are perfectly safe, though.\" Kady moves to look at the stairs, her hazel eyes widening when she realizes just how much of those this behemoth has. At least three landings above her head and she didn't realize how shocked she was until she felt Milo's finger under her chin, closing her mouth. \"Don't want to catch flies, Kady-bug,\" he jokes, using her old nickname. \"How many rooms does this place have?\" \"More than thirty, but I haven't gotten around to counting. The attic's split into three rooms and they're all pretty huge. Take it easy with the lights because the electricity bill's gonna cost us an arm and a leg.\" \"I can imagine.\" Most of the chandeliers hanging overhead looked wired for electricity, but the next room she walked into had a massive fireplace and a silver candelabrum resting on the mantle. \"That's weird.\" August crosses the room with four long strides and picks the candle holder up, studying it with some interest. \"This looks like the real deal, too! One of the workers must have found it and left it here for us to have.\" That was the only way he could get the workers to do anything with this place, by offering them a hefty sum and the promise that they could have any hidden treasures they could find. There was a high-backed love seat near the fireplace, the back made to look like butterfly wings, and there was a low table across from it. \"Are we staying here tonight,\" Kady asks, stuffing her hands in her jean pockets. She didn't want to stay in this place, not when it was dark and she couldn't see where she was running. What if I start sleepwalking and fall over one of the banisters? \"Of course we are, it's an hour and a half drive back to the village.\" He must have seen the scared look that flitted across her face because his expression hardened. Cop mode . \"Kadence Marie Hastings,\" he scolds, pointing at her,\" I won't have you moping around again.\" Kady makes a face at that, staring down at her scuffed shoes instead of at August. \"Yes, sir.\" There was no arguing with him when he's in cop mode, not that Kady felt like arguing right now anyway. She was exhausted from the flight over here and just wanted to collapse in a bed, but she was hoping said bed wasn't hiding a boogeyman underneath it. \"Which room is mine?\" \"Whichever one you choose.\" He was back to normal now, looking happier than he has since Estelle had died. \"As long as it's not on the third floor.\" \"Is the third floor forbidden,\" Milo asks, stepping out of the room in order to spot the third floor landing. \"No, it's just…. A little spooky to be honest.\" August scratched the back of his head, a habit that appeared whenever he was tired or stressed. In this case, he's probably a little of both. Who wouldn't be stressed in a house like this one? \"Alright, you two can have first dibs, but no fighting.\" Again, Milo and Kady's gazes lock before both of them make a dead sprint for the wide staircase, bumping each other out of the way while their father shouted behind them. \"Careful, that's mahogany!\" While Milo branched to the left once they reached the second floor, Kady went to the right and all the way to the very last door, throwing it open to find a spacious bedroom. The bed seemed to dominate the room, done up with pink and white curtains and matching comforter, there was a white nightstand beside the bed, a bookcase on the right wall beside another doorway while an old wardrobe stood against the left wall, and a powder blue desk was under one of the large windows against the same wall as her headboard. The walls were painted a pale lilac with white trim and part of the wood floor was covered in a soft, faded yellow rug. Curious, she moves to her right to peer through the doorway and finds that she has her own bathroom complete with porcelain sink and a clawfoot tub, both furnishings have bronze fixtures and looked like the originals. The floor was white tile that matched the walls, but it was brand new and shiny, and a shelf was fixed to the wall closest to the tub for holding towels and her washing stuff; above the sink was an old mirror, stained at the bottom corner, but mostly clean. \"I figured you'd choose this room.\" Kady lets out a squeak and spins on her heel to face her dad, August laughing a little when he realizes he'd scared her. \"Your brother's decided on the room down the hall and I'm in one downstairs.\" \"That's great,\" she mumbles, coming back into the bedroom with another of her forced smiles. Overhead there was another one of the chandeliers and a smaller version of the downstairs fireplace built into the wall a few feet from the wardrobe. \"What made you buy this place, Dad?\" She'd been dying to know ever since he decided to fly them all out here since he'd never professed a dire need to visit England before. \"You don't know?\" Kady arches one of her brows, continuing to stare up at her father until he gives another small laugh. \"It belonged to your great-great-grandparents on your mother's side and she inherited it when they kicked the bucket. We were supposed to spend last summer fixing this place up, but then….\" Then she got sick and wasted away in a hospital . \"But we're here now and we're going to make the best of it.\" \"Should I start wearing my hair in pigtails and playing with knives?\" \"Ha, ha,\" he returns sarcastically, catching her reference,\" Sorry, Kady-bug, but we have a nicer house than the Addams family.\" \"Don't call me Kady-bug.\" Only Milo is allowed that nickname, he's the one that gave it to me . They were only a year apart, but they've relied on each other all their lives and felt more like twins. While August and Estelle had run all over the country on vacations, Milo and Kady were left behind with grandparents to take care of them. Now he expects us all to be one big and happy family . \"Well, I'll go get the bags out of the car and you just get some rest, Kadence.\" She nods, not really paying attention as he slips out of her room. Letting out a breath, she flops backwards onto the queen-sized bed and stares up at the pink canopy above her, wondering when August had dug it out of storage. She hasn't been obsessed with pastel colors since fifteen when she decided she liked a grunge look better—horror movie posters on her walls, dark blue blankets, plaid printed pillows that were soft to the touch, and a desk covered in her little drawings. She doesn't like this room, she doesn't like this house, and she especially doesn't like this damn weather. I just wanna go back home .[Chapter 2] It wasn't until late that they had finally moved all of their boxes inside and arranged the boxes in a way as to avoid tripping over them in the middle of the night. Kady had never felt so tired and it was easy for her to fall asleep that night, hidden under the heavy pink comforter, dressed in her warmest pajamas, and her fuzziest socks. Had she been in Oklahoma, she would have just slept in a huge tee and panties, but it was far too cold here to do that. She was even cold after piling on a few more blankets, shivering in her sleep. She dreamt that she was trapped in a blizzard that night, ice surrounding her on all sides and snow piled up to her hips, trapping her in place. Only, it wasn't the pure white color she was used to, this snow was as red as the clay beneath the house, the clay itself oozing through the ground and covering her bare feet. She kept moving, something told her that stopping would mean death. Her chest was tight, her gasping breaths appearing as white smoke, and still she kept walking forward with her arms wrapped tightly around her. She felt as though a thousand needles were pricking her exposed skin, the sharp gusts of wind like a slap to the face that drove the air out of her lungs. But ahead, just a few paces beyond, was the warm glow of a fire and she needed to reach it. The deep drifts of snow made it hard, the slick ice made it difficult, but the sucking red clay nearly made it impossible. She needed the heat that the fire offered, needed to thaw. The closer she got to the fire, the harder it was to move as the red clay rose further up her body, coating her numb feet and working its way up her legs, ruining the green silk of her pajama bottoms. Soon she found herself stumbling, her legs failing her and causing her to fall to her knees in the freezing snow. And then she felt the warmth of the fire, saw the glow brighten as it came towards her. It wasn't until there was a pale hand in front of her face that she realized the fire had been a person. On instinct and hoping for the warmth it emanated, she placed her hand in the offered one, letting out a gasp when the long fingers close over her hand and help her to her feet. She couldn't make out the person's features due to the shadows surrounding them, but he was the warmest thing she's felt since coming to England. \"Let's get you inside, Miss Hastings.\" His voice was like silk, smooth and sensual with an accent that would leave you begging for him to say anything. With their hands still clasped, he wrapped his free arm around her waist and led her back to the monster looming before them, through the front door, up the wide staircase, and down the hall to her room. \"Sleep now, dear one, for you have a lot to do here before you leave.\" As she closed her eyes and allowed the man to pull her comforter up to her chin, she wasn't aware that the man's pale hand wasn't just pale—it was almost transparent, seemingly filled with white smoke that curled whenever they touched. \"G'night,\" she managed, voice loud in the stillness of the house. The man smiles down at her, the deep gash under his right eye seeping with crimson smoke. He stayed on the edge of her bed, watching the teen sleep and ensuring that his great-great-granddaughter wouldn't wander out again. Moments later, a horrendous groaning sound echoed through the house, another sign that it was waking up after lying dormant all these years. And Thomas Sharpe frowned when he heard the soft notes of the piano floating up from the parlor. Kady woke slowly the next morning, aware of how warm it was in the room where it had been jarringly cold when she went to bed the previous night. She takes a moment to just stare at the wardrobe across the room before begrudgingly kicking off the blankets and getting out of bed. She was barefoot, so the second her feet came in contact with the wood floor beyond the safety zone of her rug, she let out a little yelp and jumped backwards. \"Son of a bitch,\" she hisses, running back to her bed and rooting around for the socks she'd managed to lose last night. When she finally has the pink and black striped socks on her feet and her robe thrown on over her PJs, Kady makes her way downstairs to the small kitchen. Unlike the other rooms in the house, the kitchen seemed to have everything cramped together. No one else was awake yet, so Kady was free to do some cooking without August drooling or Milo complaining about the mess she might make. She wasn't sure what time it was, just that her internal alarm clock wouldn't let her sleep any longer and neither would her grumbling stomach. They had worked right through supper yesterday and she was starving for some omelets. Kady moves over to the iPod that was always kept in the kitchen and brings up her cooking playlist, her head bobbing along to the music as she gets out the needed ingredients, cooking spray, and a muffin tin. \" I had a barbeque stain on my white tee shirt ,\" she sings along quietly, spraying the tin before adding in the diced ham and tomatoes,\" and she was killing me in that mini skirt, skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks …\" Next she grabbed a mixing bowl and eggs, cracking a few of them open and dumping them in the bowl, tossing the shells in a nearby trashcan; after that, she stirred in some baking powder, milk, and vegetable oil. \" She had a suntan line and red lipstick, I worked so hard for that first kiss …\" She poured the mixture over the ham and tomatoes before adding shredded cheese and putting the tin in the oven. \" And a heart don't forget something like that .\" After setting the timer and pausing the song, she leaves the kitchen to explore the first floor a little better. The front hall is massive, allowing a good view of the landings and doorways that branch off from it; all of the wood was dark and it seemed the only thing that didn't suck in the light was the ancient elevator next to the staircase. Hanging from the wall on her right was an old fashioned mirror similar to the one in her bathroom; there were splotches in the bottom left corner and near the middle of it. She moves to look closer, taking in the dark bruises under her eyes and the way the black of her Hufflepuff robe and the poor lighting made her tanned skin seem yellow. Her dark blonde hair reached her waist in a tangled mess and there was a splotch of something red on one of her cheeks. She moves a hand up to wipe it off, brow furrowing as the red stuff crumbles against her fingers. Clay . Her heartbeat sped up as she remembered the dream, the details hazy, but the sucking clay coming back with full clarity. Had she really gone for a late night stroll last night? She parts her robe in order to see the bottoms of her pajama pants, the green now russet from the clay that seeped up through the ground. \"What the fuck,\" she breathes out. Then something was moving quickly out of the shadows, making her spin to look behind her and finding nothing. Something was in here, something big, and she bet it wasn't friendly. Shaking the uneasy feeling off, Kady runs back to her room, getting dressed for the day partly because August didn't like his kids running around in pajamas and partly because she wanted to get rid of any evidence that last night's dream was real. It was Saturday—House Pride Day in the Hastings household—so she dressed in a gray skirt that stopped around her knees, dark blue winter tights, a white button down under a dark gray sweater, a yellow and blue tie, dark blue heels to give her some height, a Twenty-One Pilots bracelet, and a blue and yellow headband to keep her hair out of her eyes. She slid the headband on after she managed to tame her thick hair, then she went back downstairs to the kitchen seconds before the timer goes off. After that, she's too busy to notice much of anything, taking a couple of the omelets into the parlor with her where a piano sat in the middle of the room. There were several boxes piled up against the far wall and fresh white paint on the walls that still made her nose crinkle at the smell, but what captured her attention was the fire place that took up a large portion of the left wall, made up of stone with words carved into it. Ad montes oculos levavi. Was it Latin? The fireplace had to be part of the original house since no one she knew even tried to write in Latin anymore. She moved over to it and ran her fingers along the words, wondering what they meant. \"What'cha staring at, Kady-bug?\" Milo's voice makes her jump, the teen laughing when she turns to glare at him. \"Relax, kiddo.\" \"Don't call me kiddo, you're only a year and a half older than me.\" Milo just grins, coming to stand next to her and stare at the words she was just studying. \"To the hills we turn our eyes,\" he proclaims in a deep booming voice, puffing his chest out and furrowing his brow to look tough. \"Is that what it says?\" \"I should know, I did take Latin my Freshman and Sophomore years.\" He basically deflates, returning to his relaxed stance and softer tone. \"It's a pointless class, by the way, don't get drawn in by the cool sounding words.\" Kady smiles up at her brother as he looks around them, finding the familiarity in his features comforting. No matter where they went, Milo didn't seem to change too much and she could always count on that. The front of his dark brown hair—their mother's hair—stuck up under the beanie he wore, his lips were thin, hazel eyes identical to hers in their almond shape, but his nose seemed a little too big. He was dressed in Slytherin green and black with a dark green sweater that had 'Slytherin Quidditch' printed on it in silver with crossed broomsticks, black sweats with the Slytherin coat of arms and house name printed on one leg of it, a green and silver scarf to help fight the cold, his green and black robe nearly identical to the Hufflepuff one Kady still had on, and a pair of black sneakers. \"Kids,\" August calls out from the front hall, voice echoing loudly in the house,\" where are you guys?\" Milo and Kady share a look before leaving the parlor and walking into the kitchen where August had wandered, their father already biting into one of the four leftover omelets. \"Kady, I'm so glad you can cook.\" \"Someone has to,\" she remarks, sitting down at the table. \"The salsa's in the refrigerator if you want some.\" She never understood the appeal of ruining perfectly good eggs with salsa, but that was one thing August and Milo agreed on, so she kept her mouth shut. \"I'm not cooking lunch, though, y'all can heat up some of those mini pizza things in the freezer.\" Milo winks at her, not able to speak since he had a mouthful of food. August doesn't tolerate bad manners; it would only get us locked in our rooms for three days with welts on our asses from his leather belt. August Hastings fully believed that disobedient children deserved punishment, and it didn't take long for Milo and Kady to learn what would get them swats. \"Kady, I want your room unpacked by supper.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"That goes for you, too, Milo.\" He sends a stern look in Milo's direction, one of his eyebrows cocked up. He was on the verge of cop mode and Kady hoped Milo wouldn't say something that would get him in trouble. Milo met Kady's gaze first, hazel eyes locked and he read the plea she had there. Don't anger him . \"Yes, sir,\" Milo finally said with a respectful nod at their father. \"I'll start as soon as I finish eating.\" August gave a nod back, going back to his breakfast. It always amazed Kady how fast August's moods could shift, their mother always joking he could go from happy to mad in half a second. He managed to hide that pretty well until Kady broke a vase when she was four, then she went around with a red ass for a week. \"Kady, I'll do the dishes since you cooked, but you should go start on your room.\" She makes a noise of acknowledgment, sending Milo another look before walking out of the kitchen, down the hall, and up the stairs to her room. It wasn't as messy as August would say it was, mostly just boxes stacked up in the corner, but she didn't want to be grounded, so she set to work quickly. Clothes went into the wardrobe, the few books she had were stacked neatly on her desk, her laptop was set perfectly in the middle of it with a cup full of markers and colored pencils beside it; her sketch pads went in the top middle drawer while the erasers and calligraphy pens went in the top left drawer. The pink teddy bear she's had since childhood goes on the other side of her laptop and the toiletries go in the bathroom. All in all, it took her a good three hours to get everything the way she wanted it, but what caught her attention was that she was still cold even after the sweat-inducing work. Am I sick or is it really so cold in here? Next door, she heard someone moving things around and she wondered why anyone would be nosing around in a room they'd left empty. She walks out of the bedroom and stops in front of the closed door of the room next to hers, wiping her sweaty hands on her robe. She had a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach, similar to the one she had as a kid. Don't be stupid , the Boogeyman's not real and he's certainly not on the other side of this door . Still, she hesitated as she reached out a shaking hand to turn the knob and swing the door open. Instead of some horrible creature hunched over with bright red eyes that was sacrificing a helpless farm animal, she found nothing but dusty floors. \"Who ya gonna call,\" she mumbles softly. As she closed the door and walked back to her room, a pale man comes out of the shadows and begins to pace once more.[Chapter 3] Kady was seated in the front hall with her back against one of the walls, using a dark blue Sharpie to color on the bright white toe of her Converse, the blue blending nicely with the dark purple to symbolize the sunset. Her plan was to use a silver Sharpie after the background dried and color in the Enterprise since it would go with the galaxy design printed on the sides of her shoe. Milo was somewhere upstairs, probably still working on his room if the obnoxious singing and occasional curse was anything to go by, and August was in the parlor sweeping. Since she had finished her room so quickly, August had allowed her to be lazy until the new maid showed up. That would be a new thing for Kady to adjust to since they've never had one before. Whenever she thought of maids, she pictured an old crone with gray hair tucked into a strict bun, a high-collared black dress, and sensible shoes—well, that or a girl around her age in a fetish costume, but she doubted that would happen. No, it was more likely that the former would show up on their doorstep. What are we supposed to do with a maid—throw pizza pockets at her, leave small amounts of dust on things for her to clean? To be honest, Kady wasn't thrilled at the idea of having a maid, but she also knew this house would be impossible to maintain without a little help. Later on, if the maid worked out, there'd be another woman and two men joining as well, though Kady didn't know how the hell she was going to feed them all. She was making Chicken Alfredo tonight, but she would need to make a grocery list later on in case the maid didn't like what was in the kitchen. It was made clear earlier that Kady would be the one cooking because August couldn't even make a simple pizza and Milo could burn water. Oh well, at least I like cooking . Estelle had taught Kady everything she needed to know and Kady's grandmother had taught her even more, so Kady was set for life as long as she didn't get burned out on it. As Kady began the outline of the Enterprise in pencil, there came a knock on the front door that seemed to echo throughout the house. \"Kadence, could you get that,\" August called from the parlor. She didn't bother answering him, just setting the shoe down and getting to her feet, dusting off the back of her skirt before making her way over to the heavy wooden doors. The people on the other side were nothing like she'd expected the help to look like. The woman standing before her was the complete opposite of any maid she's ever seen on TV with straight black hair that fell past her shoulders and had bright blue streaks running through it, her complexion was pale with a few wrinkles, and she had warm brown eyes. Instead of a dress, she wore a pair of red and black checkered pants that hugged her shapely legs, a black leather jacket opened over a dark gray sweater that had a red heart on the front, a pair of sensible boots that had a thick heel, her left nostril was pierced twice by two small gold rings, and Kady could make out a dragon earing that started at the top of her ear and ended at the lobe where the tail pierced the soft flesh there. Beside her was a little girl that might have been around five or six with hair just a shade lighter than the maid's and just as straight, she was slightly tanner than her mother, but her eyes were wide and dark enough that they could be passed off as obsidian; she wore a pair of dark blue jeans, a pink Aristocats sweater beneath a dark gray coat, dark blue shoes, a blue beanie pulled down over her ears, a Christmas charm bracelet, and a silver snowflake necklace. Both of them had one hand wrapped around the handle of their respective suitcases while their free hands were joined. \"You must be Emy,\" Kady greets with the sweetest smile she can manage, stepping to the side to allow both of them entrance. \"I'm Kadence, August's daughter.\" \"Right,\" the woman, Emy, smiles, leading the little girl a few feet inside as Kady shuts the door. \"This is my daughter, Amy, she'll be staying here, too.\" Kady offers the little girl a sincere smile, laughing softly when she hides behind her mother's leg. Kady noticed that the woman wore no wedding ring and wondered if that had been the deal closer when August had allowed her to interview. She has to be in her early or mid-thirties, just a few years younger than August. \"Um, do you want a downstairs room or upstairs?\" \"Definitely downstairs, I don't want to chance Amy falling down the stairs in the middle of the night.\" Emy lets out a nervous laugh, prying her hand out of Amy's and resting it on the little girl's head. Kady motions for the pair to follow her, leading them to the bedroom the farthest away from August and flipping on the overhead light for everyone to see. It was a bit dusty in that room, but it wouldn't hurt Emy to start cleaning this room before she cleaned the rest of the house. \"Anyway, my father should be out here soon since he was only around the corner in the parlor and I'm sure you'll meet my brother at dinner, but Milo mostly passes time in his room.\" \"August told me he had two kids.\" August already and not Mister Hastings? He must really like this woman . All of Kady's and Milo's friends weren't allowed to use August's first name and they've known him almost as long as Kady and Milo have. \"Well, I hope you packed your magic bracelets because you're going to need them if you're working in this place,\" Kady says, only half joking as she nodded towards Emy's Wonder Woman suitcase. \"See you guys later.\" She could hear the pair talking quietly as she moved back to the entrance hall, Amy laughing and making a tiny smile tug on Kady's lips. Unlike Milo, she actually liked little kids and had a feeling that she and Amy could be decent friends. It's going to be confusing since their names are so similar, though . \"Did you show them to a room,\" August asks, rounding the corner. \"Yeah, but you might want to wipe the dust off your forehead before you go and say hi.\" He had a long streak of dust or dirt one that spanned the length of his forehead, making the creases there more noticeable. August was only forty-five years old, but his job as a police officer already had wrinkles appearing prematurely on his darkly tanned face. He frowned more than he smiled, but Kady could see a bit of happiness in his eyes when Emy was mentioned. I hope she's not a gold digger or something . \"Thanks, sweetheart.\" And then August was walking back the way Kady had just come from, using the sleeve of his sweater to wipe at his forehead as he went. Kady just rolls her eyes, picking her shoe back up and making her way up the stairs to her brother's room. As she had expected, Milo was still working to get his room unpacked, his top half inside the tall box that held his books. With a grin, Kady tiptoes over to her brother and begins to work her fingers against his sides where she knew he was the most ticklish. Milo lets out a high-pitched squeal before thrashing against her to get away, but the box allowed only limited movement and he was stuck until Kady decided to help him out. \"Kady,\" he calls breathlessly around his laughs,\" n-no! Bad, Kady-bug!\" After a minute of struggle, he manages to throw himself backwards, knocking Kady sideways onto his bed and himself to the hard floor. The two share happy smiles as Milo rises up on his elbows, Kady taking the moment to observe Milo's new room. Like hers, Milo's room was spacious and had its own bathroom, but his walls were painted a deep blue with silver stars on the ceiling. There was no doubt in Kady's mind that their father still believed Milo was interested in astronomy just like he thought Kady was still obsessed with all things pink and girly. Milo's bed was a four-poster like hers and his blankets were dark green while his pillowcases were silver, the rug that covered most of his floor was the same color as his walls, and his desk was a boring white. Boxes were strewn all over the floor, but most looked to be empty, and there were several posters covering the wall near his door and bed, most of them for his favorite bands but a few for the movies he and Kady went to see together—Pirates of the Caribbean, Jurassic World, Indiana Jones. His painting stuff was set up near his desk, on the flat surface of his desk was his laptop and the drawing tablet that hooked up to it, a printer, and the stuffed bunny Kady had given him when she was four; beside his desk was a wardrobe similar to the one in Kady's room, but his doors were flung open to reveal the clothing inside. Half of the wall across from his bed had bookcases that were filled with all of his novels and above his desk was a large window that allowed him to see outside, but his showed a different angle of the yard than Kady's. Milo was the one that inherited a lot of talents in their family—he could draw, he could write fairly well, and he could sing well enough to have a decent YouTube following. \"You wanna help me with the last of my books,\" he asks, tossing a thick book beside her on the bed without waiting for her answer. \"No,\" she moans. \"Kadence Marie,\" he says using his Boss voice,\" you tickled me, so you're going to help me finish this.\" She rolls her eyes, grabbing the book and moving over to the bookcase closest to the desk, finding an empty space near the middle shelf and sliding it between his Death Note manga and War and Peace . \"You can borrow one if you want, Kady.\" \"No thanks, Bubby.\" Unlike her brother, Kady had trouble staying focused on one book for long, she'd rather be drawing the characters than reading about them. It constantly frustrated their grandmother that Kady wouldn't sit still long enough to make it through Wizard of Oz , but she seemed pleased enough when Kady was able to assist her in making a complicated chili recipe without much trouble. \"Hey, did you have a weird dream last night?\" \"No, but I did hear August playing the piano at a God awful hour.\" He passes Kady another few books before kicking the box off to the side and plopping down in his rolling desk chair, moving his laptop closer to him. Kady frowns, trying to remember if she'd heard the piano last night, but drawing a blank. \"Are you sleepwalking again, Kady?\" \"I don't know. Maybe we should start locking my door again.\" \"It's probably just from the stress of the move, no need to overreact.\" He pulls up iTunes and soon Fall Out Boy is playing just loud enough for the teens to hear, but not loud enough to have August yell at them. \"Have you tried getting on the internet today?\" \"No, I've been working on my shoes.\" He nods, hazel eyes focused on his computer screen as Kady goes back to putting up the books in their proper places. She hesitates when she finds Anna Karenina , wondering if she could borrow it long enough to remember what Anna looked like so she could add another sketch to her portfolio. Suddenly, Milo lets out a horrified scream and the book slips out of Kady's fingers as she rushes to his side.[Chapter 4] \"What's wrong, are you okay,\" August shouts as he sprints into the room with Emy right behind him, not stopping until he was kneeling in front of Milo. \"Why are you screaming? What's wrong, Milo?\" Milo stared at August with wide eyes, looking completely horrified as he pointed at his computer. Kady moves closer to get a look at what had Milo in shock and then slaps the back of his head for making her so scared. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \"He's freaking out because he doesn't have WiFi here,\" Kady snaps, crossing her arms over her chest. \"What?\" August was angry now, eyes darkening as he rests his harsh glare on Milo. \"You screamed because I don't have the internet up and running yet?\" \"No,\" Milo scowls,\" I screamed 'cause I saw a creepy chick reflected in my screen.\" August's brow furrows and he stands quickly, taking a look under the bed, in the bathroom, and behind the bedroom door. \"Didn't you see her, Kady?\" Kady shakes her head, feeling uneasy that someone had been in the room without either of them knowing until Milo caught sight of her in his laptop screen. \"She couldn't have run out without me or Emy seeing her, Milo.\" \"I guess I was seeing things. Sorry for scaring you guys.\" Instinctively, Kady reaches out and gives her older brother's shoulder a squeeze. \"Maybe you should get some sleep, Bub, you look tired.\" Milo nods and watches as August and Emy walk back downstairs, the adults talking quietly. Milo had that look he usually got when he was brushed aside by August, like a puppy whose owner had just kicked it. It tore Kady apart to see that expression and she tried to think of something to get his mind off the experience. \"Hey,\" she says after a moment,\" how about we play Indiana Jones?\" \"What,\" Milo asks, drawing himself out of his thoughts to stare incredulously at his sister. \"We haven't played that since we were kids.\" \"Which is exactly why we should do it now!\" \"No, I just want to smoke some pot and take a nap.\" He shakes his head, resisting even as Kady grabs one of his wrists and tries to tug him to his feet. \"Kady, just leave me alone.\" \"Nope, you always get paranoid when you're high, so we're going to explore outside while Dad flirts with the new maid.\" He throws his head back, staring up at the ceiling for a few seconds, wanting to bug Kady before standing and nudging her towards the door. \"Put on warmer clothes and meet me outside, Kady-bug.\" He couldn't help a smile when he sees her sprinting down the hall to her room before he shut his door, moving over to the wardrobe to pull out some clothes. Even though she was only a year younger than him, Milo still thought of Kady as his baby sister and would chose her over anyone else any day. Milo dresses quickly, shedding his house colors in exchange for black sweats, a black sweater with 'Fries Music Netflix Wattpad Music' printed on it in white, a red beanie, sunglasses, and a beaded lion bracelet on his right wrist while his watch went on his left one. Once that was done, he grabbed his camera and started downstairs where a little girl was playing in the front hall with a Barbie and stuffed dragon. \"Do you think flattery will keep you alive, Burglar,\" she inquires in a deep voice, making the dragon bounce a little. Milo smiles down at her, bringing up his camera to snap a quick picture. It's not every day you find a kid that could quote Smaug with no problem. The flash of the camera has her huge brown eyes widening further as she stares up at him. \"Hey, kiddo, what'cha playing?\" He kneels down in front of her, picking up the little Poly Pocket that was lying near his foot. \"Hobbit,\" she whispers shyly, dark hair hiding her face from view. \"Hobbit, huh? That was my favorite book when I was little, I had it memorized by the time I was ten.\" \"Really?\" \"Uh-huh, my mother used to read it to me before I went to sleep, she did all the voices and everything.\" The little girl meets his gaze again, and takes the doll from him when he holds it out to her. \"What's your name?\" \"Amy.\" \"I'm Milo.\" Both of them look up when they hear footsteps on the stairs, finding Kady practically skipping down them if such a thing were possible. She flashes Amy a bright smile when she gets to the first floor, holding out a hand to help Milo up. \"Have you met Amy yet?\" \"This morning,\" Kady nods, but Amy was already hiding behind her hair again. \"You ready, Milo?\" \"I'm ready when you are.\" Giggling, Kady pulls him after her out the door and into the bright afternoon sunlight. He was blinded for a moment even with his sunglasses on, forcing Kady to stop until his eyes adjusted. The last thing he needed was to break his ass trying to go down the iced over stairs. When he could see again, he looked over at his sister to ensure she was actually dressed warmly. She had changed into a dark red sweater, jeans, a pair of bright pink Converse with butterflies drawn on the toes, her bright red coat, black scarf, and sunglasses; her hair was loose and hung down almost to her waist in soft waves, her face was oval-shaped, her nose thin and turned up just the smallest bit, and her mouth was small. \"Come on, Bubby!\" She was already in the front yard, giggling again as she walked backwards a short ways. As annoyed as he was that Kady wouldn't let him angst in his room, Milo couldn't deny that he'd missed playing the games they had deemed childish when he was ten and she was nine. Indiana Jones basically meant they would go exploring as they had in every house they'd ever lived in, and Allerdale Hall was the biggest by far. \"Don't get too far ahead!\" \"Slow poke!\" Milo rolls his eyes, but speeds up a little as he walks behind his sister. The lands surrounding their new home were sprawling for lack of a better word, it seemed like an endless expanse of white with soft rolling hills beneath his feet. Some of the snow drifts nearly reached his waist and he was starting to think he should've worn his snow camo to stay warm. A few yards from the house and nearly hidden was a crumbling stables where horses and carriages would have been kept once upon a time. While Kady was running towards the skeleton trees, Milo started towards the stables on the right, stopping a few feet away and eyeing the run-down, decaying wood warily. Would it come apart while he was rooting around inside; crush him and muffle his cries for help? His old fear of being buried alive came to the forefront of his mind, the nightmares of a transparent coffin with dirt sprinkled on top making his breath hitch in his throat. His hands started to shake the longer he studied the failing structure, imagining being half-frozen in the snow with a crushing weight pressing him down. Would Kady notice or would she be too far away to hear? Could he shovel his way out if it collapsed on top of him or would he be knocked unconscious? His thoughts raced wildly and tears spilled down his cheeks as terror consumed him. He wanted nothing more than to run back into the house and curl up in August's lap like when he did as a child, but he was frozen in place. His sole focus was the stables, that terrible smell of damp wood almost making him gag when it reaches him. That's why he jumped so high when he felt something cold collide with the back of his head, his first thought being that the structure really was collapsing until his mind registered the giggle behind him. He turns quickly, locking his gaze on his baby sister. She was a good five feet away from him and snow was beginning to melt on her palms. Snowball . When he didn't react by throwing one in return, a crease formed between her brows and she came quickly to his side. \"You wanna talk about it?\" Did she somehow know where his thoughts had taken him? \"I mean, it couldn't be just stress making you see things since we've moved houses about six times since we were born.\" The woman in the computer screen, of course . Milo shakes the morbid thoughts of burial out of his head and offers Kady a smile. \"I'm sure it was nothing, Kady-bug.\" He could see the wheels in her head turning and knew she wouldn't let the subject drop until he distracted her. \"Let's go see if there's any treasure in here.\" As much as he hated the idea, he pointed at the stables using his thumb. Kady stares at him for a moment, torn between questioning Milo further or letting him have a respite, then she shrugs and walks inside the stables. The inside of the stables was as nasty as the outside, the smell of decay more pronounced and bits of moldy hay filling the stalls. Clearly someone had made a home here at one point if the old candy wrappers were any indication, and one of the back walls were scorched from a fire that had gotten too large. Most of the stalls had already collapsed and lay in hazardous piles on the ground and one of the side walls had caved in; in fact, the stables seemed barely upright, and even swayed with the hard winds. Milo breathes in deeply, closing his eyes and thinking of happy things like puppies as he exhales slowly, trying desperately to calm himself. \"Hey, I think I found something!\" He opens his eyes at his sister's words, finding her kneeling beside the collapsed wall and looking at something beneath it. \"Help me move this.\" \"No chance in hell,\" Milo snaps, walking over and jerking her upright and away from the wood. He could still make out rusty nails sticking out of it and didn't really want to listen to a lecture from August that he'd get if Kady needed a Tetanus shot. \"Let's go explore somewhere else.\" \"What? But you're the one that wanted to come in here in the first place!\" \"I changed my mind, now come on!\" He turned to head back outside, but paused when he heard the creaking of the wood and a gasp behind him. \"Goddamn it, Kadence!\" He turned with a glare in his sister's direction, clenching his jaw when he spotted her back on the ground and trying to move the wall. With an angry sigh, Milo again joins her, but this time he jerks the wall up a few feet. Kady scowls up at him, but jams her arm into the small opening, feeling around for whatever caught her interest, the very tip of her tongue coming out as she focused on the task. The wood was heavier than he had thought it would be, the damp seeming to make it heavier and his back was beginning to ache from the weight of it. \"Got it!\" Kady moved her arm out of the gap right as the wall split and fell back into the snow, crushing the spot where her arm had been seconds prior. Milo and Kady look at spot in shock, Milo still tightly clutching the bit of wood that had broken off in his hands. \"Oh, that could've been bad.\" \"Ya think, Einstein!\" She scowls at him again, standing up and brushing some snow off the knees of her pants. \"What was worth a broken arm?\" She opens her hand and they bend their heads together to examine the object closely. It was an old-fashioned bronze key that fit snugly in Kady's hand, the top of it made to look like a toothed wheel with smaller gears on top of it, layered intricately, and there were two gears a few inches below that on the shaft and one in the center of the bit. There was a silver chain threaded through the biggest gear and Milo used that to snatch the key out of Kady's hand. It was the type of key you'd see in a movie like Cinderella, used to lock up trunks or castle doors and held by the owner of the house. The thing Milo was wondering was why it would be all the way out here instead of in the house. \"What's that thing, Bubby?\" Kady wasn't even interested in the key anymore, and Milo followed where she was pointing until he spotted something sticking up out of the snow a few feet away from the house. He couldn't fathom how it had caught his sister's attention, but it gave him an excuse to get out of the stables without telling Kady about the phobia he thought he'd left behind in prepubescence. \"I guess we should go find out.\" But Kady was already running towards it before Milo could finish his sentence and he was left to follow in her dust, tucking the key away in the pocket of his sweats. When he reached her, Kady had already pushed most of the snow off the thing, revealing a lump of old metals all melted together. \"What do you think?\" \"I think our house used to belong to a mad scientist.\" \"They was crazy,\" a high voice called to them, drawing the siblings' gazes to where Amy was standing with her dragon clutched tightly to her chest. \"The man built lots of stuff out of metal and his sister murdered little kids so they could have supper.\" At this point, Milo wasn't above believing that his ancestors had been the type to eat children and drink the blood of innocents to survive. It'd seal the deal if this was a gingerbread house . \"Mister August said he wanted Kady to make food now.\" It wasn't until Milo looked at his watch that he saw it was nearly dinner time. \"Tell him I'll start it after I get cleaned up.\" Amy gives a quick nod before turning and running back inside, slamming the front door shut behind her. \"Do you really think Amy was telling the truth?\" \"That our ancestors were cannibals way back when,\" Milo asks, only half-joking,\" Nah.\" Last thing I need is her having nightmares about Hannibal Lector again . Later that night, Milo was immensely grateful for the soft bed in his room as he fell back onto it, kicking off his shoes. After dinner, he and Kady were charged with rearranging the furniture in the parlor so that it would mirror their old game room back in the States. August had busied himself with dishes, Amy had been sent to her room for a bath, and Emy was packing up the leftover Alfredo from dinner. Despite hating the chore with a burning passion, he and Kady knew it would earn them no brownie points if they argued, so they had disappeared into the parlor and began the job. At first, they tried to make it a game to see who could move the heaviest piece of furniture—an old oak cabinet meant to hold video games and DVDs—the farthest, but then the exhaustion caught up with them and they just tried to keep each other awake. It took them both three hours just to get the cabinet against the far wall and the leather sectional across from the TV, but not so close that their Wii Fit board couldn't fit comfortably in the space. The real work would be tomorrow when they were expected to move in the other stuff—pool table, air hockey table, putting in shelves to hold pool cues, and then hooking up the flat screen that weighed more than he and Kady combined. He hurt everywhere and the constant cold of the house only served to make it worse, he didn't even feel up to changing into his PJ's, let alone taking a bath to wash off the sweat and grime. I'll do that in the morning . He lets out a sigh, his relaxing muscles making him ache further as he laid over the plush comforter beneath him. He was almost asleep when he felt the end of his bed dip down under someone, his first thought being that Kady was too cold to sleep by herself. \"Can I help you,\" he asks without opening his eyes, expecting the answer to be Kady curling up next to him. Instead he heard a woman's voice, the hard tone sending shivers down his spine. \"You can, actually,\" the woman replied, her lilting accent making him think of Irene Adler. He cracks his eyes open, finding the woman at the end of his bed to be a complete stranger. She was tall and sat so straight that he almost asked if she had a stick up her ass, her dark brown hair was done up in a severe bun, and her cheekbones could be classified as a dangerous weapon. Then his eyes traveled downward to her attire: a high-collared dress in a blood-red shade that only served to make her appear paler than the bone white she already was. \"You're the woman from earlier…\" She was in my room and I didn't even realize it until I saw her reflection in my computer screen. Is she a ghost? Should I call Ghostbusters or an exorcist? \"What the hell do you want with me?\" \"I want you to assist me in getting a little revenge.\" She gave him a horrible smile, full of dark promise that sent his stomach to twisting. Part of him distantly realized that he was feeling aroused, but most of his thoughts revolved around how off this woman felt. It was like his rational mind was rebelling against her presence screaming ' Not human, not human! ' \"And I want you to get the fuck out of my room.\" Her expression darkens, if that was possible, and Milo began to rethink his choice of words. Is there a polite way to tell a ghost to fuck off or should I just be blunt again? \"You shouldn't spurn me, Milo,\" she murmurs, her lips feeling like velvet against his ear. \"Not when I'm stronger than I have been in years.\" And then she was gone and Milo was left staring at the stop she'd occupied, colder than he had been when he first went to sleep. Did I just get propositioned by a ghost hooker?[Chapter 5] Kady missed a lot of things she had before the move to England—the leaves that were still in all shades of Autumn, a heater that actually worked, internet access, but most of all she missed a house that was quiet when she was trying to sleep. At her old house, there were no creaks and groans that she didn't know by heart; hell, she could be sitting in the downstairs game room and tell you that the creaking upstairs was just their lopsided washer. But Allerdale Hall had noises all its own and she was ready to strangle August for making them move here. There were mice on the third floor that kept scurrying up and down the halls, the pipes in the kitchen would protest loudly whenever she tried to use the sink, the house seemed to groan whenever the wind picked up, and there was some kind of animal in the room next to hers that paced all damn night! She was losing what little sanity she had left, and she was one squeak away from going next door and strangling the woodland creature her damn self. Growling, she rolls onto her side and presses her pillow against her ear to drown out the sounds, glaring at the wall her bed was set against as though the wall was personally responsible for her suffering. \"One more sound,\" she grumbles irritably,\" just one more and I'm going to punch something.\" It went blissfully quiet for a moment, like the house had heard her and was complying, and Kady allowed her eyes to close. Squeak . Kady throws her covers off her and quickly pulls on her shoes before stalking out of her room and pushing the door to the room next door wide open, her fear of the Boogeyman clouded by the annoyed rage that was boiling in her veins. What she found on the other side of the door had that fear doubling in size, freezing her in place as she stared at the thing that had been pacing until the door opened. It—a man, she realized after a second—was standing stock still in the middle of the room, his head turned in her direction with surprise evident on his face. Everything about the man was white except for the black of his hair, one of his eyes, and a gash directly below it, the eye filled with blood and the gash leaking a crimson vapor that curled in the air. Dream guy . \"Who—?\" But he was gone before she could even get the word completely out, and the room seemed colder than it had been when she flung the door open. She was still frozen a minute later when it dawned on her that she wasn't hallucinating, that the squeaking of floorboards had stopped the moment the man had gone still. In a daze, Kady shuts the door and takes a few healthy steps away from it until she felt the wood of the banister pressing against her lower back. We really do have ghosts. Do they have ghost exterminators or should I call those Warren people that handle stuff like this? She was terrified, shaking all over as she tried to process what she had seen. Am I dreaming again? A quick, not to mention painful, pinch on her arm dismissed that theory and really cemented the fact that she had seen a ghost. Heart beating fast in her chest, Kady ran back into her room and locked the door behind her before diving into bed. \"Covers protect me,\" she whispers over and over, pulling her blankets over her head and curling up in a ball. Her mother had taught her that when she was little, that monsters couldn't find you once you were under the covers because they work as camouflage. \"Covers protect me, covers protect me.\" But will they protect me from Hannibal Lector's ghost? Milo didn't want to wake up the next morning, not when every inch of his body was sore from getting most of the parlor set up the night before. He felt like he hadn't had more than two hours of sleep, which might have been accurate considering he had such a hard time last night. It seemed he'd see that ghost's malicious smile every time he closed his eyes and he'd shoot up in bed expecting her to still be leaning over him. He lets out a shaky breath, running a hand through his hair and causing it to stand up more than it usually did. Maybe August would let him take it easy if Milo promised to work even harder tomorrow? He could only hope, but he had very little of it as he moved into the bathroom for a shower. Maybe the hot water will help ease the soreness in my muscles . He hasn't felt this sore since his first swim practice, but he knew the only way to ease it is to work through it. As the water was heating up, he walks over to the sink and starts brushing his teeth, eyes trained on his reflection. That's why he saw it, the way the steam from the hot water seemed to part and swirl around empty air the way it would if a human passed through it. \"I'm just seeing things,\" he mutters, staring hard into the basin of the sink as he finishes what he's doing. All the same, he turns slowly and looks around him for any other sign that someone was in the bathroom with him before shutting the door and undressing. Normally he'd only wear boxers and a pair of sweats to bed, but that was impossible here since the house feels like a freezer. He quickly stepped under the warm spray of water, letting out a sigh of relief as he left the frigid air behind him and his body slowly began to relax. Knowing August would expect him downstairs for a family breakfast soon, Milo washes as quickly as he can before rinsing off and getting out. The air seemed colder than usual, but he put that down to his wet body and grabbed his towel to dry off, using it on his hair first since his hair is his pride and joy. He was slow when it came to drying everything else, muscles protesting his movements and the arm he broke in sixth grade throbbing because of the cold. He tried to push it all to the back of his mind, going on autopilot to get himself dressed in clothes that would ensure he stayed moderately warm but could move easily. He pulls on a pair of dark jeans that hung low on his hips, his deodorant, a dark blue tee with an unbuttoned dark blue flannel shirt over that, thick socks, his usual Sneakers, a belt to keep August from giving him the disapproved parent stare, his watch, and a braided cord bracelet that featured two faux silver skulls biting a metal oval. To complete his morning routine, he turns back to the mirror to style his hair and slip on his beanie, but what he finds waiting for him has him shaking from more than just the cold. There were three words written on the steamed up glass, the script elegant and tilted slightly, fading as the steam dispersed, but he could still read them clearly. Beware Crimson Peak . Milo stays in there long enough to grab his comb, beanie, and hair gel before bolting out of the bathroom and down the hall to Kady's room where music was playing quietly from the iPod on her desk. Kady was seated next to the iPod, knees drawn nearly to her chest, and she was writing something with an old fashioned fountain pen. Milo moves over to her, tossing her laptop on her rumpled covers before seating himself in her chair and propping his feet up on the desk. They were quiet for a moment, Kady's eyes trained on the sketchpad and Milo's eyes on her face. She was tense, her brows knitted together, but he couldn't tell if it was from wanting whatever she was writing to be perfect of if she was as scared as he was. Has she experienced anything? But he didn't know how to breach the subject and he didn't want to scare her if she hadn't seen anything. After a moment, Milo stands and hops up on the desk next to her, leaning over to see what she was so focused on. Calligraphy practice, he realized, taking in the detailed, swirling handwriting, I forgot she'd been taking classes before we moved . Then he really focused on what she had written, it was a saying from American Horror Story that she'd been fond of, but it only made his stomach clench. ' Close your eyes and remember everything is going to be okay .' \"Have you seen her, too,\" he whispers, voice barely heard over the sound of the classical music Kady had playing. Slowly and carefully, Kady lifts the fountain pen from the paper and screws the lid on it, and it's only then that Milo realizes that the pen was gold— real gold—instead of the blue and metal one August had given her when she'd started her classes. \"Where'd you get that pen, Kady-bug?\" \"I found it on my desk this morning,\" she whispers back. She was ashen and there was a tremor in her hands as she hands the pen off to him. He studies it closely, noticing flakes of russet clinging to the gold near the lid. \"I think he gave it to me as an apology for keeping me awake at night.\" \"August?\" \"No, th-the other man…. The dead one.\" The song changes, the tune upbeat and he recognizes it as one from Glee. \"Is there a woman here, too? Did you see a woman ghost?\" He nods, still staring down at the pen, turning it over and over in his hands until something caught his attention. There was a word etched into one of the sides, barely visible, but it seemed to flash slightly from the light shining into the room. Edith . \"Didn't we have a grandmother named Edith?\" \"Uh, yeah, she was crazy so Gram put her in a home until she died. I think we were six and seven when she finally passed away.\" \"But didn't she always go on and on about a book she'd lost in England?\" \"Uh-huh, but she was off her rocker.\" \"Guys,\" August calls, cutting off Milo when he walks into Kady's room. \"Come on, it's time to get moving.\" Milo sets the pen down on the desk and hops down, walking to Kady's bathroom to fix his hair, still processing everything. \"Geez, Kady, I bought you a chair for a reason.\" \"I sit in front of a desk for eight hours a day when I'm in school, Dad.\" The music cut off and their voices faded as they left Kady's room. Milo was still thinking about Edith, trying hard to remember anything about her that didn't involve her crazed ramblings. What was her last name? McMichael or something like that . He shakes his head a little, sliding his beanie on and walking downstairs to the kitchen where everyone had gathered in anticipation of whatever Kady was making. \"Are you feeling okay, Bub?\" \"Fine,\" he mumbles, making a point to sit between August and Emy. When he looks up from his empty plate, intending to ask about Edith, he freezes in place and stares behind his dad with widened eyes. The woman was there, basically just a shadow that seemed to melt against August's side, but the red accents of her dress stood out from the darkness surrounding her. \"Maybe you should take it easy today, just get some rest.\" \"Yeah, maybe I should.\"[Chapter 6] Milo had high hopes that he'd be able to sleep tonight since he'd been given a break that day; a free pass to laze around is a rare thing to get from August when there was work to do. Milo had taken full advantage of it and spent some time outside—well away from the stables—and explored the woods a little more now that he had a chance. The trees were all bare, reminding him of skeletons as they rose high above his head. It was like they were trying to reach the leaden skies, trying to get away from the desolate house just yards away. The rest of the day, between meals, he sipped on the tea Emy had made earlier and caught up on his reading, finishing half of Carolina Moon before bed. Kady had spent most of the day with him after she got the video games and movies organized, both of them listening to music as Milo read and Kady wrote with her new pen—just writing down random words in different fonts or designs. After a while, Amy joined them with her dolls and they all played out a scene with them from Star Trek. And now Milo was lying on his back with his hands under his head, staring up at the canopy over his bed, able to make out the Hercules constellation picked out in silver thread just a few inches above Canis Minor. Knowing he wouldn't be sleeping any time soon, Milo stands and decides to go to the game room to play some Assassin's Creed. He quickly pulled on some shoes and a light jacket before leaving his room. \"I'm sorry….\" The whispered words caught his attention and he turned his gaze towards Kady's room. Instead of another ghost like he'd been expecting, he found Kady stumbling down the hall, eyes half-opened and one hand outstretched like she was being pulled along. He just stared for a moment in confusion, watching his sister shuffle closer and closer to him. He was almost certain she was coming to his room until she turned suddenly and faced the empty space where the elevator should have been. \"Okay, I'll come with you.\" Feeling sick to his stomach, Milo sprints down the hall and wraps his arms around her, lifting her off the ground and hauling her backwards away from the empty space. They hit the ground hard, the impact making his arm ache even worse and forcing Kady into wakefulness. \"Are you okay,\" he gasps, staring down at her. In that moment, all he could see was the scared little girl he remembered from childhood, all big eyes and trembling lips as she fought to be brave. \"It was her,\" she says, beginning to cry,\" she said she was taking me to the mines to make sure everything was still working.\" A surge of protectiveness runs through him and he holds Kady tightly to him, rocking a little and smoothing down the back of her hair. \"Shh,\" he soothes,\" I've got you now, Kady-bug, and that bitch will never lay another hand on you.\" \"I'm scared, Bubby.\" \"I know, but I won't ever let them hurt you again.\" He holds her tighter, letting out a relieved breath. He almost hadn't caught her in time, he'd almost seen his sister die, and that was enough to have him crying against her shoulder in the same manner she was doing to him. A creaking noise made them both tense, watching from their spot on the floor as the cables holding the elevator begin to strain against the heavy weight and shake slightly as the noise grew louder and louder. \"What's happening?\" \"I don't know.\" He stands quickly, pulling his sister up after him and angling them so that he was standing half in front of her as the top of the elevator becomes visible. \"Jesus Christ.\" He could feel Kady's nails digging into his skin as she clung to his arm, both of them shaking and watching in horrified astonishment as the elevator continues to rise. It's only when he sees the head of dark hair inside the elevator that he slings Kady over his shoulder and sprints down the stairs, nearly falling a few times when his ankle tried to give out, but he didn't stop until he was in the parlor. \"Will we be safe in here?\" \"We'll find out,\" Milo replies, setting Kady down on the couch before moving to the doorway and peeking out. From the parlor, he could barely make out the front hall and the elevator, now dangling a few feet above the second floor, but there was no one in there anymore. Still breathing hard and wide awake now, he slides the glass doors closed, locking them and drawing the curtains in case she decided to pay them a visit. \"Wanna play Yahtzee?\" Milo lets out a surprised laugh, looking incredulously at his sister as she moves across the room to get the dice and scoring pad. \"I don't want to think about what just happened and what better way to distract myself than to remind my big brother how sucky he is at this game?\" \"Fine, but I'll have to remind you that I'm superior at Assassin's Creed.\" She gives him a half-smile, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the low coffee table while Milo retrieved a calculator and two pencils before joining her on the opposite side of the table. When Estelle first got sick, the three of them would play Yahtzee to take their minds off things, so this was like a little tribute to their mother's memory. \"You got yourself a deal, Milo.\" Milo shifts until his feet were under him before taking a die from Kady and rolling once before passing it back for Kady to roll. August prided himself on that fact that not a lot of things could shock him—hell, he's been shot before and he wasn't shocked since that was almost expected in his line of work—but the sight he found the next morning left him totally baffled. Not only was the elevator on the second floor, but the doors to the parlor-turned-game room were shut and locked. \"Is everything alright,\" Emy asks, walking out of the room they'd shared the night before. \"I don't know,\" he answers honestly, brows furrowed as he continues to stare at the closed doors. \"Is there a reason we're standing here?\" \"I left these doors open last night after I moved in the pinball machine.\" He scratched the back of his head, trying to remember the events of the night before. \"Babe, will you go get my keys off the dresser?\" \"Sure.\" He watches her reflection in the glass of the doors, eyes focused on her swaying hips until she disappeared around the corner. He shakes his head, reaching out a hand to jiggle one of the faux-gold handles and frowning when they still won't push down and allow him entrance. \"Here you go.\" He jumped at Emy's voice, not having heard her approach. \"Thanks.\" He picks the right key and inserts it in the lock before sliding the doors open and stepping inside. The white splatter-painted curtains were drawn over the large windows, but he was able to make out his kids slumped against each other on the floor, their backs against the couch. The TV mounted on the wall across from them still showed the menu screen for Home Alone and a finished game of Yahtzee was scattered across the coffee table. \"Did we miss a party last night?\" \"I guess so.\" \"Do me a favor, honey?\" He looks down at her, feeling his face heat up when she entwines their fingers. \"Don't slip into cop mode and berate them for this. They probably just wanted to spend the quiet time together without one of us yelling at them to do some work.\" \"It's not like I'm a slave driver.\" \"You haven't exactly taken it easy on them either, August. Believe it or not, they're still children and you haven't spent much time with them since you got here, so take the day off and do whatever they want to do. Me and Amy can spend the day in town together; Kady has a grocery list anyway, so we'll do some shopping. Just…. Show them you're still their dad and maybe tell them about us so we can drop the whole 'hired help' façade before Amy blows it.\" \"I guess I can do that.\" \"I'll go and get Amy ready and you go decide what to do until they wake up.\" She pats his chest, allowing him a chaste kiss before she heads back the way she came, making a slight detour for Amy's room. It had been hard for him to move on from Estelle, but Emy was really helping him and he was hoping his kids would accept her as more than the maid. Heaving a sigh, he shuts the doors again and goes back to his room to change out of his pajamas. Instead of his usual button down and khakis, August decided on a gray shirt with sleeves that stopped at his elbows, jeans, the watch Estelle gave him on the last Christmas they'd spent together, work boots, and the beaded lion bracelet that was nearly an exact copy of his son's apart from the coloring—August's was made to resemble amber while Milo's was more akin to marble. Once dressed, he moves towards the entrance hall where the thermostat was located, slapping it a few times and fiddling with the buttons until he heard the heater kick on for the first time in three days. Maybe now it'll warm up in here . Amy's quiet voice meets his ears seconds before she comes into the entryway with Emy following behind her. \"Okay, we'll be back around dinner time,\" Emy sighs, giving August a hug and a quick kiss before taking Amy's hand and leading her to the front doors. \"Have fun, girls,\" he calls after them, grinning when Amy smiles at him over her shoulder. She was a sweet girl, but she was shy and August wasn't sure how to handle shy children since both of his could have walked into a room filled with strangers and leave with a room filled with friends. All the same, Amy was slowly opening up to him and even curled up in his lap last night. Still smiling, August heads towards the parlor and only hesitates outside the doors when he swore he felt someone pressing against his back, but he shakes that feeling off. After all, there was no one else in the house now apart from him and his children, and there was no such thing as ghosts. Kady lets out a soft whimper, wondering why her bed was so hard and why every part of her was aching like she'd slept on concrete. Slowly, her eyes flutter open and she stares around in confusion until the events of last night came back in one terrible wave that hit her hard. She jumps up, looking for any sign of the female ghost, but finds that she and Milo are still alone in the parlor. She also found out why she hurt so badly, they'd both fallen asleep on the floor while marathoning the Home Alone movies. Her heartrate slowing back to normal, she lets out a relieved breath and nudges Milo until her brother was cursing, but awake. \"The fuck, Kady?\" \"Get up already, I don't want Dad to bite our heads off because we slept past nine.\" That had Milo standing as quickly as he could, which wasn't fast since he had to be hurting as much as she did. \"God, I need a bath or some p—\" \"Morning, guys,\" August grins as he slides the parlor doors open. Milo and Kady let out loud groans when sunlight hits them, shielding their eyes with their arms. \"Come on, my little vampires, run upstairs and get dressed, and then we're gonna have a family day.\" \"There will be no running involved.\" August laughs softly as they shuffle past and Kady could still feel him watching them as they start up the stairs. On the second floor landing, Milo and Kady pause and swallow hard, staring at the elevator that was dangling two feet off the floor. \"It wasn't a nightmare,\" Kady murmurs, biting her lip. \"No,\" Milo whispers back,\" but I won't let anything happen to you.\" He gives her shoulder a squeeze, walking her down the hall to her room. Kady goes straight for the wardrobe digging out her favorite dress despite the cold, and fresh underwear. \"I'll get you some pot later tonight, but you'll have to keep the window open to avoid August's snooping attempts.\" \"Thanks, Bubby.\" \"No problem. If you need anything, just scream and I'll come running even if August doesn't.\" She gives him a nod, waiting for the door to close behind him before she moves into the bathroom, being sure to close and lock that door as well. She sets her clothes down on the back of the toilet before plugging the drain and starting the water as hot as she can handle it. While the tub was filling up, she pulled her pajamas off and moved to the sink to brush her teeth. She was used to the cold by now and the bathroom door was firmly shut, so she didn't care about walking around the bathroom in her birthday suit. Maybe the ghosts will see me and then run away in terror . \"Hurry up, kids,\" August yells from downstairs,\" I have a surprise for you both!\" Knowing August is as impatient as herself, Kady bathes and dresses as quickly as she can, still pulling on her pale blue Converse on the way down the hall where she met Milo doing almost the same thing, his hair sticking out since he hadn't had the chance to style it. \"Don't touch my kitchen,\" Kady shouts,\" last time you cooked, you nearly burned our house to the ground!\" She and Milo skid to a stop inside the kitchen, finding August leaning against the wall and smiling at them. \"Okay, that smile's getting a little bit creepy.\" \"Yeah,\" Milo agrees,\" it's like the smile Pennywise gave before he ripped Georgie's arm off.\" August makes a face at that, but doesn't comment. \"Why are you in such a hurry this morning?\" \"Did we do something you don't approve of?\" \"Well, now that you mention it,\" August admits,\" which one of you decided it would be fun to ride in the elevator last night?\" Milo pales at his words and Kady distracts herself by looking for one of the baking pans. \"Come on, you're not going to get in trouble over it.\" \"Must be the messed up wiring.\" Kady's hands were shaking as she dug through the lower cabinet where she stored her pans, her heart beating so loudly that she was surprised no one else could hear it. \"I heard it moving last night, but blamed it on the pipes.\" \"Honey, you don't have to be afraid to tell me the truth. Were you sleepwalking again and accidentally got on the elevator?\" \"What? No, I told you what happened. I was in Milo's room because it was too cold in mine and we both heard it.\" August lets out a disappointed sigh, shaking his head and pinning Kady in place with his stare when she made the mistake of looking his way. Would he believe me if I told him the truth? The answer was easy and came quickly to her mind—hell no. He'd probably send her to a therapist or claim it was a hallucination from playing on her phone all the time. \"I did it,\" Milo says quickly, drawing their father's gaze. \"I came downstairs for some water and I was afraid that I would fall down the stairs since I was barely awake. I should've told you sooner and I apologize, sir.\" \"Thank you for telling the truth, Milo.\" August claps Milo on the shoulder, nodding approvingly as he continued to speak. \"Another thing I'm curious about, why were the two of you camped out in the parlor?\" This time it was Kady that spoke up upon noticing the deer in the headlights look her brother sent her way. \"Cleaning party,\" she blurts out,\" we noticed how dusty it was and wanted to surprise you.\" Milo nods quickly, offering a nervous smile. \"I don't think Emy's even tried cleaning in there, but I'm pretty sure we made more of a mess during our breaks.\" \"Don't worry about it, all you have to do today is have fun. I'm calling a family day, so what do you guys want to do first?\" Talk about the fact that we're being haunted and admit Milo never took the elevator. They're both fine choices in my opinion . \"I'd like to find out why Emy felt the need to rearrange my pans. They were perfect the way they were and now my system is completely destroyed.\" \"Emy hasn't touched your pans, Kady. Maybe you did it when you were cooking yesterday.\" Or maybe the resident bitch of a ghost moved them to piss me off .[Chapter 7] It was late when Emy and Amy returned to Allerdale Hall, weighed down by numerous bags, but giggling all the same. The noise gained Kady's attention, and she looked up from the game of Chicken Foot she was losing. It was already dark outside despite it only being around five o'clock and they had a fire going in the massive fireplace across the room. Unlike the family days in the past, August had actually seemed interested in letting Kady and Milo pick the activities, and they had spent nearly three hours playing Candyland. Kady would admit that it had been nice spending time with her father without hefting boxes around or rearranging furniture, and she had decided that they could all watch a movie after Milo won at Chicken Foot. He was the best at this game and she would've accused him of cheating, but Milo was famous for throwing the dominoes when his honor was challenged. \"You're turn, sweetheart,\" August says, tapping her hand with one of his fingers. With a sigh, she looks from the dominoes spread out on the coffee table to the three she had left to use. After a moment's debate, she picks up the double-sided four and sets it under the four of another domino, sending the boys a smug grin. \"Chicken foot,\" she declares, giggling when August drops his head into his hands. Milo still looks confident, setting the four side of one of his dominoes under the one she'd just put down. \"Pass, I have no fours left.\" Kady had to pass as well and that only had Milo's ego swelling as he set another four down, and another until there was a shape of a chicken's foot. August takes a moment to study the dominoes, tapping one against his chin as he thinks about the moves he could make. \"Alright, I guess this'll have to do.\" He sets down a domino, the five side of it pressed against another five side. \"And I'm out.\" It was only Milo and Kady left in the game and the siblings glared playfully at each other. They each had two dominoes left to use, and Kady was itching to get rid of the blank domino since it was worth the most when points were tallied up. \"What's wrong, Kady,\" Milo taunts,\" no usable dominoes?\" \"My dominoes are more useful than that beanie on your head,\" she shoots back, Milo playing at offense as he rests a hand on his beanie. \"That's below the belt.\" \"No, below the belt would be saying how surprised I am that it fits over your ginormous ego.\" Milo makes a face and August has tears in his eyes as he laughs at the jibe. Sending her brother a playful wink, she sets down the blank domino under another one. \"Don't you dare.\" \"Chicken foot.\" Milo's eyes narrow and he sets down another blank sided domino against her own. \"And I'm out.\" She had no more dominoes she could use, so she pushed the domino she had left over to allow Milo to see the face of it. August quickly tallied up the scores, proclaiming Milo to be the winner with Kady surprisingly coming in second place. \"Oh yeah,\" she shouts, jumping up with her arms raised triumphantly above her head,\" second place!\" \"Tone it down a little,\" August instructs with a laugh, tugging on the edge of the pale blue dress Kady was wearing. She didn't care how cold it was in the house, she shaved her legs this morning and everyone had better appreciate her for it. \"Hey, guys.\" Kady turns, finding Amy and Emy standing in the doorway of the parlor. Emy holding a silver tray weighed down by tea cups. \"Did you have a good day?\" \"Yes we did,\" Amy confirms, seating herself on the floor between August and Kady. \"I got a new baby doll and Maman got a pretty dress for Christmas.\" Christmas was less than two weeks away and Kady hoped this year's wouldn't be as depressing as last year's had been. \"Can we give them their presents early, Maman?\" \"I don't see why not,\" Emy grins, setting the tray down on top of the scattered dominoes before leaving the room. Kady took one of the tea cups, sipping at the dark brown liquid inside and wincing at the taste. The look August sent her way told her not to say anything about the pour taste to Emy, so Kady took another reluctant sip before setting it down on the table. \"Here we are.\" Emy sits between Milo and August, digging out a small box wrapped in pale pink paper, handing it over to Kady before handing Milo a smaller box wrapped in blue paper, and August one wrapped in dark green. August's was the same size as Milo's and Kady watched as a ring on Emy's finger gleamed in the flickering firelight. It was a simple ring, made of silver with a modest diamond, but it was on her ring finger and that had Kady's stomach clenching. \"You first, Milo,\" August encourages. Milo, ever the unobservant, tears the paper away to reveal a black velvet box that creaked slightly when he opened it and pulled out a black ring. It was beautiful and looked the perfect size for one of his long thin fingers, the black of it only disturbed by the white lines cut through it to look like a Celtic design of a dragon. \"It's great,\" Milo says with a smile in Emy's direction, sliding the ring over his thumb and showing it for everyone to see. \"Your turn, Kady-bug.\" Kady removes the paper and tosses it on the table before opening her slightly larger velvet box, finding a delicately made silver necklace inside of it, the chain long as she pulls it out and there were small diamonds set into the snowflake that dangled from the chain. \"Beautiful,\" she whispers, nodding her thanks as she slips the chain over her head, the snowflake resting just below the white collar of her dress. August went next and Kady watched in trepidation as he revealed a ring that was a masculine version of the ring Emy was wearing. No . The unspoken news hit her hard as August slid the ring onto his ring finger, the wedding band Estelle had bought him no longer there. \"You married her.\" It came out as an accusation, like she was condemning him as a criminal instead of a new husband. Emy looked from August to Kady and then to Milo, her dark eyes holding concern and confusion. Clearly she had expected August to have told the kids about their elopement, but he had kept them distracted with games and singing competitions. \"Is this some kind of joke,\" Milo asks, voice cracking at the end. August opened and closed his mouth a few times, trying and failing to come up with something to tell them while Emy just turned a dark shade of red from embarrassment. Mom's barely been dead a year and he's already married again . Kady could feel her throat tightening as she held back tears, standing up calmly and walking out of the room. She kept her back straight and her chin raised, she bit her lip to keep the tears back, and she didn't let any of them see just how much the news had hurt. It was like there was something constricting her chest and she was finding it hard to breathe even as she began to go up the stairs, her pace measured. Estelle was supposed to be the love of his life, the only woman that ever mattered to him, so how could he get married to someone so different? Kady knew it was selfish that she didn't want her father to be with anyone else, but how was she supposed to feel when he was marrying a woman so much younger than himself? It felt like he traded in Estelle for a younger model. What was that quote she used to think of whenever she remembered her mother and father together? 'I thought an hour ago that I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a man, but a half hour after that I knew that what I felt before was nothing compared to what I felt then. But ten minutes after that, I understood that my previous love was a puddle compared to the high seas before a storm.' It was from the one book she took real pleasure in reading because her mother and father had read it to her and Milo on their anniversary every year, and they had done all of the voices. Whenever she pictured Buttercup and Westley, it was her parents that came to mind no matter how different they were to the descriptions in the book. Kady had always known her parents loved each other more than anything else in the world, so the news of her father's secret marriage had set her girlish dreams to crumbling. Once she had her bedroom door firmly closed behind her, she crumpled to the ground, ignoring scraped knees and the blood staining the flesh of her hands as she beat them against the floor. In that moment, she was a little girl again, she wanted her mother to tell her everything would be fine and her father to scoop her up in his strong arms to make her giggle. But she knew it would never happen like that again, Estelle was dead and Kady was a big girl that was expected to console herself. That's why it came as a surprise when her bedroom door opened and she felt warm arms surrounding her, pulling her back against a hard chest as she continued to cry. None of them had ever grieved Estelle's death properly and now it seemed all the emotions she had held back were rushing to the surface and she couldn't dam them up any longer. The tears left tracks on her flushed cheeks and her eyes were raw and red, her entire body was shaking from pure sadness, and she felt like she would never be that same completely happy person she had been before. It seemed she cried for hours, gaining only a little comfort from the person holding her so tightly, like they could protect from all the horrors and angst that fueled the world. Finally, her throat sore and her tears drying on her face, she allowed her other senses to come back and she realized she wasn't being held by someone she knew. The chest was narrower than Milo's or August's, the arms too strong to belong to Milo yet not strong enough for her father, and she smelled the cloying, copper scent of blood. \"Who are you,\" she manages to whisper, voice hoarse after her crying. \"Thomas Sharpe,\" the man answers, the accent familiar to her. The man that brought me back inside and tucked me in last week . \"You are my granddaughter, little one, and I shall do you no harm. I will keep you safe as I should have done Edith all those years ago.\" His voice was soft and low, reminding Kady of lullabies as she relaxed against him completely. \"Close your eyes, Kadence, and allow yourself to dream. I will watch over you and ensure the safety of you and your brother.\" And, despite the distant fear she held in her mind, she allowed herself to fall into a deep slumber and she dreamed of her mother. Emy was the first to wake the next morning, donning her robe and slippers before making her way into the kitchen with a plan to cook breakfast for once. After the disaster of last night, she wanted to find a way, no matter how small, to try and get the children to like her. If they continued to refuse as they had last night, then August would leave and take his impressive fortune with him, leaving Emy and Amy with nothing again. She couldn't live like that again, not now that she has a house like this and a husband to dote on her. \"They'll just have to get used to me,\" she whispers to herself, going through the familiar motions of making tea. \"What if I had a better idea.\" It was a woman that spoke, her voice high and strong with such a seductive note that Emy found herself shivering. \"What if you didn't need their approval, Emilia?\" Emy lets out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding, her eyes half-closed as she feels hands on her hips. Emy knew who it was immediately, she's known the woman since stumbling here half-dead three years ago after an abusive client had stabbed her and thrown her out of his car. Lucille Sharpe was sin, pure and simple, and Emy would gladly kill a thousand people if it meant being able to kiss her shoes—or better yet, the full, soft lips that were often drawn down into a pout. \"I'll do anything you wish.\" \"Such a dedicated lover.\" Emy let out a low moan when she felt Lucille's hands moving up to massage her breasts through her thin nightgown. \"Don't you even want to know what it is?\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"Put arsenic in their tea, just a small amount so the children die slowly and painfully. It would delight me to watch her descendants die as she was meant to.\" Edith Cushing , Emy knew, the woman that escaped death and started a family in Buffalo. She left Allerdale Hall pregnant with the child of Thomas Sharpe, a healthy baby boy that had children of his own. Lucille wanted revenge against Edith and Thomas and that doctor that had fancied himself a hero, and what better way than by killing August's children and then possessing August to ensure the house doesn't start to decay again? \"Yes, my darling,\" Emy breathes, arching her back in pleasure and gripping the counter tightly. \"Oh God, yes, whatever you wish.\" \"There's one more thing you must do, Emy, to avoid suspicion of poisoning.\" Lucille's velvet lips pressed against Emy's neck, biting lightly at the tender spot that nearly finished Emy right then and there. \"You must kill your precious Amy as well.\" \"Consider it already done.\" Milo was shuffling past his father's room when he heard something, a soft speaking too quiet for him to make out through the thick wooden door. Instead of continuing down the hall like a smart teen would have, he instead pressed his ear against the door and strained to make out what August was saying. Is he talking to Emy? Milo shakes his head, remembering that he'd just seen Emy making her way upstairs to wake Kady up. Amy was playing in the parlor and Milo knew August wasn't talking to him, so who the hell was on the other side of the door? Feeling brave, Milo cracks the door open just enough to peek inside, easily spotting August sitting in an armchair in front of the small fireplace, seemingly talking to thin air. It was like August saw someone Milo didn't, an invisible person that was talking right back and even over August if his random pauses were any indication. It set Milo on edge since there was no one in there for August to be talking to unless it was one of the house's ghosts. Milo pushes the door open just enough to squeeze through, moving quietly towards his father and catching a flash of crimson that moved from his father's side to the deepest shadows in the room. \"Uh, did you say something, sir,\" Milo asks uncertainly, eyes flickering between August and the place the woman had disappeared in. When he got no response, Milo moves to stand in front of the chair. August was just sitting there, back straight and his hands gripping the ends of the wooden arm rests tightly as he stared blankly ahead of him. It was like he was in some kind of trance, the type you see on TV where the person would get up and do whatever ridiculous things the magician told him to do. It was disconcerting, to say the least, to see a man as strong as August reduced to this. How do I wake him up? Do I have to say abracadabra or some shit? His jaw set, Milo moves over to the shadows and reaches out, trying to grasp the silk fabric he could hear rustling faintly. \"Come out,\" he growls when he catches sight of the crimson dress again. \"Get out here and fix my father before I go all Winchester on your ass, you skanky bitch!\" He heard a low laugh, feminine and colder than Milo had ever heard a laugh be. \"Grow a pair and show yourself!\" \"You can't hurt me, Milo,\" the woman said simply. He couldn't pinpoint where she was in the room, the flickering light cast by the fire offering little assistance and her voice seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. \"I'm too strong now and I'll have your soul in my collection soon enough. You should go catch your father.\" The words were whispered in his ear, soft lips barely brushing against sensitive flesh. He lets out a shaky breath, running back over to August and barely catching him as he fell forward. \"What happened,\" August mutters, staring around in a daze. \"How did I get over here? I was still in bed….\" \"Well,\" Milo says as he helps August back into the chair,\" now we know where Kady gets the sleepwalking.\" \"I've never slept walked before, though.\" \"You were talking in your sleep, too. Maybe we should go stay in the village for a few days, you know, to get you a doctor's appointment and a much needed break for the rest of us.\" August furrows his brows and shakes his head, relaxing in the chair and speaking in a soft tone Milo rarely heard anymore. \"Nah, Emy said the roads were caked over in ice. We'll have to stay here until it melts….\" And August was sound asleep again, snoring loudly with his chin resting against his chest. By then Mrs. Lovett will probably be gnawing on whatever's left of our mutilated bodies . Knowing August would just fall in the floor again if left in the chair, Milo hauls him up and half drags him over to the king-sized bed, grunting from the effort to get his father on the bed. \"Man, you're getting fat in your old age.\" Shaking his head, Milo leaves the room and shuts the door behind him before heading to the kitchen where he hoped to find breakfast ready. \"Hey, Emy,\" he greets, leaning against the counter and watching her bustle around. She looked flustered, her blue and black hair frizzy and small bruises littering the pale column of her throat. I don't even want to think about how she got those . The unexpected news last night had been hard to bear, but Milo swallowed down the hurt and gave a happy smile while Kady left as quickly as she could. \"What's for breakfast this morning?\" \"Whatever you can find, Milo,\" she answers breathlessly, pouring tea in the cups set on the table. \"Amy's got a stomach bug, so I have to nurse her back to health.\" \"Hope she feels better soon.\" \"I'm sure she'll get over it quickly enough. Could you do me a favor and take some tea up to Kady? I tried to earlier, but she had her music up so loud and her door was locked, so….\" Emy trails off with a helpless shrug, pausing long enough to send Milo a stressed smile. \"She was like that when she got dumped by her first boyfriend, she should snap out of it and re-join society in a few days.\" He picks up two of the cups, walking out of the kitchen and over to the stairs, taking them two at a time before turning to the right and heading straight for Kady's bedroom. Like Emy had said, the door was locked and he could hear music blasting even out in the hallway. Knowing he needed to be a hard ass in order to get inside, he kicks the bottom of her door until the music volume is lowered. \"I don't want any damn breakfast, Emy,\" Kady shouts from inside. \"Easy, Kady-bug, I come bearing gifts!\" There was a moment of silence before he heard light footsteps and then the door opened. \"You look awful.\" \"Fuck you, too.\" Instead of her usual girly touch on grunge, Kady was dressed in a pair of jeans that were slightly too big, a gray and black ombre sweater that hung down to her knees, a pair of Jack Skellington Ugg boots, and she had her hair in a braided knot at the base of her head. \"Did August send you up here to berate me?\" \"No, Emy sent me with tea, but I do have some bad news concerning Dad.\" Kady slouches in her desk chair, watching him as he scoots the papers on her desk over enough to sit on it. \"I think the woman ghost is messing with his head. I mean, he was talking to her this morning, but looked like he was in a trance when I first walked in. He didn't wake up until the bitch disappeared.\" Kady takes her cup of tea from him, but doesn't drink it yet. \"I may have some good news on the ghost front.\" \"The Boo Brothers are coming to exterminate them?\" \"No,\" she says with a laugh,\" the guy ghostie is actually on our side. Remember back before Grandma Edith passed, we thought she was going senile since she kept claiming that her husband was some guy named Thomas?\" \"Yeah, she was nuts, but what does that have to do with the cannibals inhabiting our house?\" \"Well….\" She draws the word out, voicing raising slightly in pitch as her eyes land on something over on Milo's right. \"He's kind of the guy we're related to and we have no real ties to the McMichael family like we originally thought we did.\" \"The ghost of our great-great-grandpa is still floating around somewhere in our house, isn't he?\" \"Not just somewhere, he's kind of right beside you.\" Milo goes still, eyes narrowing as Kady gulps down the scalding hot tea in an effort to avoid eye contact with him. With a tic working in his jaw, Milo slowly turns his head to look in the direction Kady had, finding the creepiest man he's ever seen just a few feet away. \"This ain't right.\" \"Pleased to meet you, too,\" the ghost, Thomas, replies with a gentle smile. Milo stands, gripping the back of his sister's chair all the while keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the pale spector in front of him. He and the bitch shared a remarkable resemblance with the same dark hair and eyes, and their killer bone structure. \"Are you feeling well, Milo?\" \"I'm fine.\" And then Milo was falling to the ground in a dead faint. Kady was dreaming again, everything around her muted except for the faint sound of music coming from the next room. She knew who it was now, knew that she didn't have to fear him anymore, and so she got out of bed and went to his room. Moonlight sucked the colors out of the empty room and made everything seem blue, including Thomas as he smiled at her. \"Come dance with me,\" he inquires, holding out one pale hand. \"I can't dance,\" she whispers back, taking a few tentative steps further into the room. She still couldn't see the source of the music, but she wasn't going to question the strange qualities of dreams. \"In dreams, you can do anything you wish.\" Lips pressed together in nervousness, she places her hand in his, her right hand moving to his shoulder while his barely brushed against her hip. \"It's a simple thing, this dance, just a combination of four steps.\" And then they were moving, dancing around the room as the music grew slightly louder, the notes high and sweet to Kady's ears. She liked this, liked the easy way they moved and how graceful Thomas made her feel. \"Was this your room when you were alive?\" \"It was indeed.\" He gives her another smile and she could see straight through him when they passed the window, the faint light of the moon shining right through him despite how solid he felt. \"Edith and I shared this room after I brought her here. She was a writer, you know.\" \"I remember her always talking about a lost manuscript that she brought back to England.\" Thomas nods, taking a moment to stop and make Kady spin before catching her up again and continuing the dance he'd learned as a child. \"It's almost Christmas.\" Kady nods, wondering where he was going with it. \"I would very much like you and your brother to join me in here once everyone else has retired for the evening. I will tell you about what Edith was like before she grew old in exchange for a song from the two of you.\" \"I'd like that.\" Thomas continues to lead the dance, bringing them out of the room and back into Kady's, ending it by scooping her up in his arms and dropping her down onto her bed again. \"Is tonight's adventure finished?\" \"I'm afraid I'm not quite as strong as Lucille, I need time to rest and so do you, my sweet girl.\" He brushes some dark blonde hair behind her ear, letting his hand linger for a moment. She knew what he was thinking about, he was wondering what it'd be like if he'd been alive to see his son and grandchildren. \"I would have spoiled you rotten had I lived, but now I'll have that chance.\" \"You would've made a really good dad.\" \"I don't know about that, but I suppose I could make a decent grandfather to you and Milo.\" His expression goes solemn as he stands and pulls the heavy comforter over her as the cold started to seep in again. \"Kady, get everyone to stop drinking Emilia's tea, she's not who you think.\" For those who don't know, Chicken Foot is a game that uses dominoes where you start with the domino marked 1 and branch off from there with the dominoes shaped like a chicken's foot at the end. The person with the fewest points at the end is the winner. The book I quote is The Princess Bride and Buttercup says it to Westley before he leaves.[Chapter 8] Two days before Christmas was a dismal time in the Hastings household, there were no decorations and no one was rushing to decorate either. After two weeks, Amy had only gotten progressively worse and nothing seemed to help her get any better. She had severe stomach cramps and vomited no matter what she ate or drank, and everyone was worried about the little girl. She wasn't the only one that wasn't up to par, August was snappish and looked like he hadn't had a decent night's sleep in months even though he spent most of his time in his bedroom. Kady would often hear him talking to someone, but the second she grew brave and mentioned ghosts, he went into a rage and slapped her squarely across the face. Now she and Milo were sneaking up the stairs to the third floor after a note from Thomas requesting their presence, and they were happy to meet up with him. Kady was curious about the elusive third floor, but was slightly disappointed when it looked like every other floor in the house. \"Welp,\" she sighs,\" this was anti-climactic.\" \"Yeah,\" Milo nods,\" I thought the third floor was supposed to be creepy.\" The landing had the same dark paneled walls on the left that matched the hardwood flooring and banister. There were a few old fashioned chandeliers that still used candles instead of electric light and Kady was wondering it that was a sort of tribute to the original architecture. \"Where were we supposed to meet Gramps?\" \"I'm not sure, he just said to come on up and he'd take care of everything else.\" \"And so I have,\" comes Thomas's voice from behind them. Kady turns with a ready grin, a grin that only widens when Thomas takes in what she was wearing. Unlike the others in the house, she'd quickly adjusted to the cold and also had a boost of confidence that morning, so she'd dressed in a pair of short jean shorts, a teal crop top that showed off her anchor and wheel belly button ring, a teal and black plaid shirt over the crop top, and a pair of tie-dye converse. \"What on earth are you wearing?\" \"Clothes, you remember what those are, right, Gramps?\" Milo breaks down into a fit of laughter as Thomas stares at Kady, shell-shocked. He looked like he'd just witnessed someone pushing his grandmother into traffic. \"Wow, if you weren't already dead, I'd be worried about you keeling over right now.\" \"It's just scandalous. Milo, how could you let her walk around in something like that?\" \"She wears what she wants,\" Milo shrugs. \"She's a junior in high school now and I've got all the guys at our school convinced that I'll murder them while they sleep if they try to pressure her into anything.\" Well, that explains why my last boyfriend looked so scared when I asked if he wanted to have sex . \"High school?\" \"The place where us kids are sent to learn. It's a horrible institution where they crush our souls and creativity, and the teachers are Krillitanes that are obsessed with using the brains of the really smart kids to get infinite power.\" Kady rolls her eyes at the reference, but smiles nonetheless since it meant Milo was just as geeky as she was no matter how much he protested otherwise. \"And why aren't you there now?\" \"Christmas break, we don't go back until after the New Year unless August decides to homeschool us.\" \"That won't happen,\" Kady states firmly,\" we'd drive him up the wall after two hours trying to teach us science.\" Thomas, no longer as uncomfortable as he had been, offers a smile and gestures for the children to follow him down the hall. \"Where are we going?\" \"I've something to show you,\" he answers. It was strange to watch him walk, his legs moved the way a human's would, but his feet never touched the ground, he just floated a few inches above it. His fine clothing made a slight rustling noise and it was then that Kady really took a moment to study her grandfather—he wore a button up white dress shirt, a black waistcoat, black trousers, and what had to be the shiniest black dress shoes she's ever seen. His black hair was mostly slicked back and it curled at the ends like Milo's did. The room Thomas leads them to is mainly empty with the exception of a mic stand and an old trunk that reminded Kady of the chests pirates used to store their treasure in. \"I noticed how sad you both seemed, so I thought we could have an early get-together. I brought this contraption up from the parlor since I saw you both singing into that black thing.\" He points towards the mic stand and microphone. \"Would you both sing something for me before I delve into sad stories?\" Milo and Kady share a look, Milo waggling his eyebrows and tips an imaginary hat in an obvious hint for the song he wanted to do. Kady, knowing she'd never live down the whining unless she agreed, gives her brother a nod. While Milo was a great singer, Kady could barely pass as average, so she was mentally cringing as Milo opens his mouth to start singing. \" I bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillion say Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away ,\" he starts with a grin, grabbing hold of the mic ,\" settling down, would you marry me if I asked you twice and begged you pretty please ?\" Kady gestures for Thomas to have a seat on the trunk while she sat cross-legged on the floor beside him, swaying along to the country song. \" She'd a said yes in a New York minute; they never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it. He just stole a kiss as he rode away, he never hung his hat up at Kitty's place. He moves his feet a little, but doesn't exactly dance as he continues,\" I should've been a cowboy, I should've learned to rope and ride, wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive. Stealing the young girls' hearts just like Gene and Roy; singin' those campfire songs, I should've been a cowboy . \" After a few more lyrics, Milo finishes up and Kady claps so that Thomas gets the hint, her grandfather giving an approving smile in Milo's direction. \"Very well done, Milo,\" Thomas compliments as Milo sits on the floor near him. \"And now, little one, I do believe it's your turn for a song.\" \"I don't sing,\" she says quickly, shaking her head. \"I could send dogs into fits with my signing voice.\" \"I don't mind.\" Knowing he wouldn't relent, she gets up and walks over to the microphone, going through the songs that she knew until she found one that would work well enough. At least she had a lesser chance of forgetting the lyrics with this one. \" Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life; done my time and served my sentence, dress me up and watch me die. If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine. Dynasty decapitated, you just might see a ghost tonight. And if you don't now, now you know; I'm taking back the crown, I'm all dressed up and naked, I see what's mine and take it! Ohh, yeah, the crown, so close I can taste it! I see what's mine and take it. Sycophants on velvet sofas, lavish mansions, vintage wines; I am so much more than royal, snatch your chain and mace your eyes.\" Kady danced along as she sang, remembering the moves she and her friends had done at a college party two months ago. \"If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine. Heroes always get remembered, but you know legends never die. And if you don't now, now you know; I'm taking back the crown, I'm all dressed up and naked, I see what's mine and take it! Ohh, yeah, the crown, so close I can taste it! I see what's mine and take it. Mortal kings are ruling castles; welcome to my world of fun. Liars settle into sockets, flip the switch and watch them run .\" His eyes bright, Thomas claps along with Milo, grinning broadly as Kady takes a dramatic bow. \"A beautiful job, little one!\" \"And no animals crying in protest either,\" Milo adds, laughing when Kady kicks at him. \"Alright, Gramps, your turn.\" \"Of course, both of you walk into the next room and you'll find some things that should help you understand this house a bit better.\" Milo and Kady shrug, walking into the connecting room. It was pitch black inside and Milo stumbles around in the dark until he caught the edge of a curtain and tugged it down to allow sunlight to filter inside. Unlike the other rooms Kady's explored, this one was disgusting, coated in thick layers of dust with moldering books scattered around haphazardly. Kady kneels down and picks up one of the books, the pages fragile and tearing away in places. The first page she opens it to is stained with dull red clay, the ink smudged, but a drawing of a house was discernable; the house in the drawing was large and immaculate with small details inked in the margins in a spidery handwriting, the words Allerdale Hall written in the bottom right corner. \"It's the original design concepts,\" she says softly, flipping through the pages and finding more sketches of furniture and custom made light fixtures. \"Check this out,\" Milo says from across the room. Kady moved to stand next to him, each of them trading items so that Milo held the book and Kady an old photo. The photo was black and white, yellowed with age and beginning to decay with everything else in the room, but the faces in the photograph were unmistakable; it was the Sharpe siblings, dressed in their best clothing and their hair impeccably arranged. The squeak of floorboards gains their attention, both teens glancing up at the ceiling with mild curiosity. \"Are we gonna go snoop in the attic to find the source of that noise in an obviously haunted house?\" \"Yeah.\" \"We'd so die in a horror movie.\" \"We'd be the first ones to get hacked to pieces.\" With resigned expressions, Kady and Milo set their things down and move out on the landing again, going straight for the staircase and making their way quietly up to the attic. There were only three doors that lined the wall on the fourth floor, and they were spaced far apart, so it was an easy choice for the teens. They moved to the door directly across from them and peeked through the gap between the wall and partly closed door, easily picking out August in the darkness. He was in a trance like Milo had described two weeks ago, his eyes glazed over as he stares straight ahead at a woman that could only be Thomas's older sister, Lucille. The pair were talking in hushed voices, Lucille pacing around the room and leaving faint impressions in the dust that coated everything. She was stronger than Thomas still and almost looked completely solid with only hints of the strange fog ghosts were made up of. \"The house is coming awake,\" August muttered, staying in place as Lucille melts against his back. \"As mad as it was all those years ago—madness feeding on madness.\" The room they were in was huge and every available surface was covered in small wooden boxes with glass covers that had moths and butterflies pinned inside, dead and dissected. It looked like a mad scientist's workshop, only with bugs instead of people. \"Yes,\" Lucille murmurs, running her hands up and down August's limp arms,\" and I need that madness to gain my strength.\" The floorboards creak under Lucille's heeled boots and the crimson of her dress looked bright in the dark room. Kady jumps a little when she feels Milo grasping her elbow, letting her brother lead her back down to the third floor. \"Something bad is gonna happen,\" he hisses, still holding her arm tightly. \"We're leaving after Christmas, I don't care if we have to knock August unconscious and drag him to the car ourselves.\" \"Why wait till after Christmas,\" I ask, desperate to leave this house behind for the rest of my life. \"I heard on the radio that it should be warm after Christmas, temperatures in the low seventies that'll melt the ice enough for us to drive back to that village.\" Kady nods, casting a worried glance over her shoulder at the staircase. \"Let's get back to our rooms before August comes down. I don't feel like getting yelled at for being on the third floor.\" Milo takes off without waiting on her and Kady hesitates for a moment before walking down the hall to the room Thomas had originally led them to. It was empty now apart from the trunk; the mic stand and Thomas were both gone. With another glance over her shoulder, she hefts the trunk in her arms and power-walks back to the second floor and directly to her room, hiding the trunk under her bed. She'd find out what was in there tomorrow, but for now she needed to go check on poor Amy. The songs in this chapter were 'Should've Been a Cowboy' by Toby Keith and 'Emperor's New Clothes' by Panic at the Disco.[Chapter 9] Kady sits in front of the trunk she found yesterday, eyes focused on the old fashioned lock that refused to be picked. She'd tried bobby pins, the tab of a Coke can, and kicking it, but the desired effect hadn't happened. So here she was, glaring and wondering why Thomas would lead her to a trunk and not give her the damn key. Wait a second…. Key! She jumps up and runs down the hall to Milo's room, not even bothering to wake him up as she starts rummaging around in his desk drawers. \"The fuck you doin',\" he asks groggily, sitting up in bed and using the flashlight on his phone to illuminate the room. \"Looking for the key,\" she answers hurriedly, pushing aside his notebooks and papers before moving on to the next drawer. \"What key?\" \"The one we found in the stables! Where'd you put it?\" She heard him getting up and walking across the room, but she only stopped digging when he dangled the bronze key in front of her face. \"This key, Sis?\" She smiles up at him, then starts laughing when she sees his hair was sticking up all over his head and his AC/DC shirt was half stuck in the waistband of his pajama bottoms. \"Why do you need it so badly?\" Kady stands up and tries for the key only to have Milo hold it out of her reach. \"Take it, I don't want to stand here all night.\" Kady jumps repeatedly for the key, but Milo was taller by a good five inches and he managed to keep it just out of her grasp. He dances away from Kady, light on his feet, but he doesn't expect it when she throws her weight against him and forces him to fall backward on the bed, straddling his chest as she tries to wrestle the key out of his hands. \"Hand it over, Milo!\" \"Not a chance, blondie!\" Milo flips them, both of them falling off the bed and to the hard floor with twin grunts. Kady continues to struggle, slapping his chest and wrapping her legs around his to gain some leverage to flip them again. She knees Milo in the side, not enough to cause any harm, but enough for him to loosen his grip. The blow to his side seemed to daze him a little and Kady took full advantage to snatch the key from him She lets out a triumphant noise, jumping up with the prize in hand. \"I've got- Ahh!\" Milo had tackled her to the floor again, sitting on her lower back and snatching the key away. \"That's so cheating!\" \"Cheating would be putting this on a high shelf and watching you come up with different ways to get it down until August gets onto both of us.\" Kady makes a sound of frustration, wiggling under him, but unable to push him off. Eventually she goes still underneath him, a sly grin making itself known. \"You can either get off of me and give me that key or I can start explaining, in-depth, of why Once Upon a Time is one of the best shows on TV, I'll be including quotes from Colin O'Donoghue and a few interviews I've memorized.\" \"You wouldn't dare.\" \"I think I'll start with the pivotal episode where Hook starts to wriggle his into our hearts—\" \"Shit, just shut up and take it!\" Milo jumps up and gives Kady the key once she was standing, the disgusted expression he had only making her grin broaden. \"Just so you know, I could kick your ass in poker because I just bluffed my way right out from under your bony ass.\" Milo makes a face and follows her down the hall, running his fingers through his hair along the way. \"What's so important about that key anyway? I mean, other than the fact that you almost broke every bone in your arm to get it.\" \"I think I know what it goes to.\" They were in her room now and she quickly knelt in front of the chest, the key held gently in her hands. \"I really feel like we should savor this moment of suspense because who knows when we'll ever get a chance to do this again.\" Milo sits beside her and snatches the key back out of her hands, thrusting it in the lock and turning it. \"Or we could just open the damn thing and savor it later if there's gold or something in here.\" Scowling, Kady pushes the lid open and peers inside, Milo joining her and the two resting their heads together as they stare at the lone object in the trunk. It was disappointing to say the least, a simple stack of papers that had been protected from the ravages of time since they were locked securely in the trunk. \"That's definitely not gold.\" \"Someone needs to break it to Thomas that a stack of papers isn't something most teens aspire to find in mysterious locked chests.\" Kady nods in agreement, lifting the pages out and brushing the dust off them. \" Crimson Peak ,\" Milo reads aloud,\" a true story written by Edith Sharpe . I guess Grandma wasn't as nuts as we all gave her credit for.\" Kady flips to the next page of the manuscript, her and Milo leaning against the side of her bed as they took turns reading. \" When I was still a young woman, I made the great mistake of marrying a man before I truly knew him. His name was Thomas Sharpe and I had never met a man like him in Buffalo before, he was incredible and seemed so cultured compared to the men that surrounded me. I had thought him a god and put aside my father's numerous words of caution just so I could be with him, and it was something I continue to regret .\" \" The Sharpe siblings—Thomas and his elder sister, Lucille—turned out to be lovers and murderers, Lucille had manipulated Thomas, not only to her bed, but to marry wealthy women and drain them of their money before they were poisoned. Lucille put it in their tea, you see, they would grow sicker by the day and she would give them more tea, pretend to be their nursemaid, until they expired. Their belongings were hidden in the clay mines below the house and their bodies were thrown into the vats of scarlet clay. \" \" This would have continued had I been without help, but I had the other women and my good friend to thank for my escape, and surprisingly, I had Thomas in the end, as well. The murdered women appeared to me as apparitions, covered in the clay that soaked the grounds, the clay mixed with blood and dripping upwards as they were not from this realm. I don't suppose I could blame everything on Lucille and Thomas for they had terrible parents that often kept them locked away and the house wasn't only a house. \" \" The house was a monster in itself, it was a horrible thing that was alive and fed on the madness of the Sharpe family. I fear that all descendants will be cursed to die within the confines of its drafty halls, I fear that the child within me will share a fate similar to that of its father. I carry the last of the Sharpe family, but I hope to break the chain by changing its surname. From now on, it shall be Alexander McMichael if it is a boy and Alexandria McMichael if it is a precious baby girl. \" \" I will protect my family from the insanity, I will die knowing they will be safe and far from England, far from Allerdale Hall where all Sharpes become damned. \" \"And to think,\" Milo says, still staring down at the thick stack of pages,\" that was just the introduction.\" \"At least our ghosts don't look like something out of a Stephen King book.\" \"Keep reading, Kady, Grandma's got me curious about what happened here.\" And so Kady continued to read, unaware of what was going on up in the attic. Lucile Sharpe missed few things about life, but the one thing she missed most of all was the pulse of adrenaline when she killed someone, the way her heart beat faster and she felt a flush of warmth in the otherwise frigid house. She missed the way fresh blood felt on her hands, warm and wet and everything this house fed on. She needed it like an addict needed Laudanum, she was drawn to bright living souls. That's where August and Emy came into the picture; for her plan to work, she needed to possess the both of them. She needed a physical body to commit her crimes against the people that claim her bloodline. They were not her relatives, they belonged to Edith Cushing and her traitor of a brother, but killing them would give her the added boost of power. She would absorb their souls into herself until she was solid again, not a cursed wraith that can't even step outside. She would kill everyone in the house to gain control again and it would be an added bonus of revenge against Thomas since she knows he cares for Milo and Kadence. He betrayed her, forced her to kill him, helped Edith murder her, and the two children he cared about would pay for his sins. Emy had started out as a way to draw energy into herself, but had slowly evolved into a viable option of becoming Lucille's physical body—she was fairly attractive and shared Lucille's fine bone structure, and she was perfect to seduce August Hastings into moving him and his family all the way here. August didn't have a strong will like his children did, his wife's death left an emptiness inside of him that made him vulnerable to possession. She just had to break him down a bit more and she would have the strength of his body to murder his children. The poison was taking too long if the oldest children were drinking it at all, but Amy was almost to the point of death. Barely six years old and half a ghost already, her body growing weaker after every cup of tea. Kady had tried to tend to the child, but it became impossible when Lucille convinced August to tell his children to stay away. She smiles wickedly at the thought of the two children, caught between choosing which one to murder first. Milo was physically stronger than his sister, but Kady had the brighter soul and would lend Lucille enough strength to banish her brother's spirit for good. She had the rest of it planned out, she would possess August and kill his two children while Emy took care of her daughter, and then she would give August full clarity back to see the good work he'd done. The sight of his children lying at his feet and his hands slick with their blood would be enough to drive the poor man to suicide. Maybe she could convince him to go down the narrow tunnel to the mines and drown himself in one of the vats she kept full of fresh clay. Squeaking floorboards makes her look away from the wriggling moth she was pinning in place with a sewing needle. August stood in the doorway of her attic room, hazel eyes cloudy as he stares at the wall across from him. He was so weak now, no sign of the caring father he had been before coming here. That first trip was all it took; she was able to sink her claws in him just enough that he convinced himself it was his idea to restore Allerdale Hall to its former glory. His face had more wrinkles now, paler than it had been, and his lips were pressed together in a thin line—the only sign of him fighting hard against her. She could feel his subconscious mind rebelling against her commands, wailing for her to kill him and spare the children because they were all he had left of the life he'd lived. On the days he was too weak to fight, he would bombard her with his memories, memories of spending time with his children and wife—spending hours in Kady's sickroom, drawing with her, or taking Milo to his swim meets and cheering him on from the stands. Sometimes he would be dancing with his wife, Estelle's hair the same shade of dark brown as Thomas's had been as a child. In short, he loved his family and would do anything to protect them, but he no longer had that ability. Soundlessly, Lucille stands and sets aside her project before crossing the room and joining August in the doorway. He moved when she asked it of him, his back to her as her hands rested against his broad shoulders. Had anyone been watching they would have said it was like watching Lucille turn into small bursts of light as she disappeared into August, the older man only letting out a faint gasp as she fully possessed him, stamping down on the memories and protests before they could toss her back out. It was only when August gave a calculating look around the room that Lucille felt truly victorious, and she decided who her first victim would be. It was dark by then, only three hours from Christmas, and she moved quietly down the stairs to the second floor before moving down the hallways to the last door on the left. Moonlight illuminated the messy room, shining in through the large window above the desk and helping her see as she made her way to the four-poster bed and perched delicately on the edge. With the old rush, she reaches out with August's hands and wrapped them around the slim column of exposed flesh, squeezing tightly even as the body beneath her began to struggle. Milo's eyes flashed open and he beat at the hands around his throat, but Lucille was too close to her goal now to be deterred.[Chapter 10] A hard slap to her face is what woke Kady up, the sudden pain spreading from her sore nose to the rest of her face rapidly. Fully prepared to hit Milo back, Kady sits up and turns her glare on him only to freeze in shock. Now, rude awakenings were something that made Kady angry, but the fact that she was woken up because her father was currently strangling her brother left her dumbfounded for a moment. Milo's face was a dark shade of purple and his movements were turning sluggish as August tightened his grip around Milo's throat, his eyes focused solely on his task. Desperate and in panic mode, Kady grabbed the first thing her hand came into contact with and bashed her father over the head with it, sending August to the floor in unconsciousness. \"Come on,\" she gasps, struggling to kick the covers off and moving to Milo's side of the bed. After reading the manuscript, they'd been too freaked out to sleep alone, so they'd retired in Milo's room and it's a damn good thing they did. Milo, trying hard to get his breath back, was unable to help much as Kady forced him to stand and half-dragged him out of her room. They needed to get downstairs and warn the other two that August was on a rampage, but the stairs seemed so far away and Kady's asthma was making itself known as she shuffled down the hall. They were at the halfway point when she felt something hard collide with her back, knocking her to the ground and Milo against the wall. What little breath she had left was knocked out of her lungs by the blow and she could do nothing as she was turned onto her back to face August. He was panting hard, pale green eyes holding no remorse as he pulled his arm back and then delivered a right hook that had Kady seeing stars. Even as dazed as she was, she knew for a fact that her father had hazel eyes and the person attacking them right now had to be Lucille. Kady wanted to struggle as August covered her mouth and nose with one of his large hands, wanted to scream and claw to get her daddy back, but all she could do was lie there and pray that he'd come to his senses. She cut her gaze towards Milo, but he was worse off than her and blood was trickling down the side of his face from where he'd been knocked against the wall. Knowing he wouldn't be able to help any time soon, Kady looks back at August, her gaze pleading as she met and held his look. August had to be in there somewhere and maybe he could kick Lucille out of him before he smothered Kady. But the longer he stayed like that and the more her lungs burned, she came to the realization that her father was long gone by now and she doubted she'd make it to Christmas morning. Her heart sped up, desperately working to keep blood flowing to her brain and she tasted blood as her teeth cut the inside of her lips because of the pressure August was using. As suddenly as August was on her, he was off her again and Thomas was standing over her protectively. \"How dare you,\" he growls at August, the air around him crackling with energy. He looked almost solid as he stood his ground, but there were two of him wavering in front of Kady and she was having a hard time in taking deep breaths to regulate her heartbeat. \"They're only children, Lucille, and you will not harm them under my roof.\" \"It's not your roof,\" Lucille shoots back in August's voice. The smile she sends Thomas's way was predatory, her teeth bared and her hands clenched into fists so tightly that the dull nails cut into August's palm and causes blood to trickle to the floor. They stared each other down as Kady crawled to her brother's side, pulling him close and holding him as the terrible scene played out. Quicker than she'd ever seen, August darted towards her, but Thomas was faster and shoved him to the side. He tottered for a second, then the leg of his pajama pants caught on a nail and he was sent backwards against the elevator, the cables not strong enough to support the sudden weight and snapping, sending the whole thing crashing to the ground. Lucille didn't even have time to cry out, the sound of grinding metal and breaking bone echoing loudly in Kady's ears as tears stung her eyes. \"Daddy,\" she rasps, shaking hard and staring at the spot he'd just been standing, only empty air now. \"Get Amy,\" Thomas instructs, helping the siblings to their feet. \"I'll get the keys for that great metal beast that brought you here and you three can meet me outside.\" Kady only stood there, her eyes wide and her lips quivering as her tears fell. Daddy's dead…. Daddy's dead…. The words kept repeating, bouncing around in her head as she processed what had just happened. \"Kadence Marie Hastings,\" Thomas bellows, shaking her hard enough for her teeth to chatter. \"Do what I said and get out of here!\" \"Y-yeah.\" She nods and wraps an arm around Milo's waist as she continues to the stairs and then down to the first floor. Waiting for them on the first floor was a mess of broken metal bars and August's body, a pool of blood spreading ever outward as he lay there—a large piece of metal speared through his chest and his head bent at an unnatural angle with a bit of white bone peeking out from the torn flesh. \"Amy,\" Milo gasps, standing a little better on his own and pulling Kady with him towards Amy's room. The little girl would be too sick to get out on her own and Kady hoped like hell that Emy would be sane enough to carry her out to the truck. Amy's bedroom is completely dark as Kady steps inside, a faint light coming from the little pink nightlight plugged in near her bed. The light was just enough to illuminate Amy's body, lying completely still without even the faintest breath to stir her thick hair. \"She's dead.\" Not entirely convinced herself and praying that it was only an illusion, Kady kneels in front of the bed and rests her fingers against the little girl's neck, flinching back when she feels the shifting of broken bone. \"Lucille must have gotten to her before she came after us.\" \"Not quite true, Kady,\" comes Emy's voice from the doorway. Milo turns sharply and instinctively stands in front of Kady, swaying a little as he struggled to find balance again. Emy was standing there confidently and even smiling as she held August's pistol in her hands, aiming it in Milo's direction. \"I killed her a few moments ago when I heard the struggle upstairs. My master will be pleased with it once she sees my good work.\" The sound of crashing objects overhead makes Emy look up, her smile not diminishing even as Milo lunges forward. They struggled for the gun, Emy obviously unused to using one as she kept her finger on the trigger. Kady stood while they struggled, squinting in the darkness for anything she could use to knock Emy unconscious or at least daze her so that Kady and Milo could get out. The room wasn't anywhere near as cluttered as her own bedroom and she managed to throw back the curtains to allow for a bit of light to shine in and help her out. She casts a glance over her shoulder, Milo and Emy still fighting for control, and then she focuses back on her task. Porcelain doll . There was a creepy antique doll set on the mantle, the porcelain shining in the moonlight as she grabbed for it and turned around. She barely made it two steps when a loud pop sounded and Milo collapsed, the noise making everyone cover their ears and Kady shout in pain. The sound was unbelievably loud without the protective ear plugs August had forced her to wear when they went shooting together and she was acutely aware now that he made her wear them for her own protection. Thankfully, Emy was just as caught off guard from the noise and Kady was able to cross the room and break the doll over Emy's head despite the disorienting ringing in her ears. \"Milo,\" she shouts, dropping to his side and helping him sit up. A large stain was spreading across his shoulder, staining the light gray of his tee. \"Get a belt or something,\" he instructs, grinding his teeth to keep from crying out in pain. Her hands shaking, Kady moves to the wardrobe and digs around until she finds a tiny pink belt, and then goes back to her brother, letting her father's lesson in tourniquets take over as she tried hard to staunch the bleeding. \"It's not gonna work good, so we need to get to the hospital.\" Despite him trying to be brave, he still lets out a squeak of pain and his legs buckle under him when he tries to stand. \"We have to get to the truck.\" Her heart was beating fast again, but the added adrenaline allowed her to focus better than she had upstairs, hooking her arms under Milo's and dragging him out of the room to the front door. Again, her asthma was interfering, but she pushed through the attack and managed to open the door before dragging him out into the scarlet snow and collapsing. \"Help me up.\" Both of them gasping in the sudden, stinging cold, Kady helps him stand and they lean on each other as they make their way to the truck parked halfway up the long driveway. As he'd promised, Thomas was standing beside the truck, looking weaker than before and barely managing a smile when the siblings stop in front of him. \"Drive carefully,\" Thomas advises,\" the roads will be atrocious this time of year.\" \"Thanks, Gramps, for helping Kady and me.\" \"It was my honor, now get in this contraption and get some help.\" Thomas opens the driver's side door, helping Kady shove Milo inside before she climbed in herself, having to adjust the seat and mirrors before turning the key in the ignition. \"I love you both, know that always.\" \"Love you too, Grandpa,\" Kady says with a sad smile before turning the truck to face the gate and beginning to drive. At seventeen, Kady still didn't have her license, but she knew the basics of driving and had seen enough action movies to know she really wanted to ram the gates at the end of the drive, letting out a childish laugh as the metal bounced off the hood and to the side as she drove past. \"Tone it down a bit, Vin Diesel,\" Milo quips, smiling even through the pain. His face was ashen from the agony and blood loss, and Kady noticed the way he kept his lips pressed together in order to keep his sounds of pain muffled. \"How about some music? I need the distraction.\" He didn't wait for her answer, grabbing the CDs from under the front seat and shuffling through them until he found the disk he'd put together for the car trip to California. \" Jessie is a friend ,\" he sings softly, voice cracking in places,\" yeah, I know he's been a good friend of mine .\" \" But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define ,\" Kady sings along quietly, finding it hard to see through the swirling snow and darkness,\" Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine .\" It was the song their dad had been obsessed with when they were younger, so they both knew the words by heart and would sing it when they needed cheering up. \" And she's watching him with those eyes ,\" they sing in unison,\" and she's loving him with that body, I just know it; and he's holding her in his arms, late, late at night. You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl! \" They continue singing, Kady stretching out a hand to grasp his free one. His right hand was pressed tightly against his left shoulder as blood continued pumping out and she was worried about him passing out or dying right beside her before she could make it to the village. \"Sing it, Bubby.\" \" Where can I find a woman like that ,\" he belts out even as he struggled to keep his eyes open. \" I play along with the charade, that doesn't seem to be a reason to change. You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute; I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot .\" The song continues playing loudly, switching to Enter Sandman once it was finished as the classic rock fills the cab. By the time they were halfway to the village, Milo had gone quiet and his shirt was soaked through with blood, Milo staring out the windshield and shivering from the cold. \"Just a little longer,\" Kady mumbles to herself, glancing briefly in her brother's direction. When she looks back to the road, a woman is standing there a few feet away, Kady instinctively slamming on the breaks and cutting the wheel to avoid hitting her. It's only when the truck begins to spin wildly on the road that she realizes that the woman in the road had been Lucille, the woman's cackling laugh growing louder as the truck catches on a boulder hidden under the snow and makes the truck come to a stop. The suddenness of it all and the lack of seatbelt had Kady lurching around in the truck and the abrupt stop had her falling forward, the top of her skull connecting with the windshield, and then she saw only blackness. Milo woke slowly, fighting his way through a haze to full consciousness again and dreading what he would find when he opened his eyes. At first, everything was blurry and distorted, his head feeling like it was about to explode, but the blurriness cleared up after a few blinks. The truck was right-side up and his tightened seatbelt had done a good job of slowing the amount of blood that pumped from his wound, but he was still dizzy and felt sick to his stomach. The coppery scent of blood filled his nose and he could already tell that he had shards of glass in embedded in his stomach and chest from the accident. Kady . He looks around for his sister, expecting to find her in the cab with him, just as confused as he was, but the driver's seat was empty save for blood and there was a massive hole in the windshield. Swallowing down his fear, Milo opens the glovebox and pulls out the pocket knife August always kept in there, cutting through his seatbelt in order to get out of the car. His right ankle was swelling and pain shot through his leg whenever he took a step, but Milo stumbled his way over to the yellow and red blob a few feet away. Kady was lying there, her eyes closed and her lips parted, her blonde hair had streaks of red in it and the top of her head was crushed in from the impact with the hard glass; one of her legs was bent under her, there were scratches all over her, but what really caught his attention was the large shard of glass stuck through her throat. He knew then and there that the glass in her throat hadn't been from the accident, it was punched through too cleanly for it to have been anything else than murder. Shaking with rage and grief, Milo rises and starts back to the truck, and climbs inside, having to pump the gas a few times before the truck roared to life. Once he was sure it wouldn't stop again, Milo goes back and picks Kady up, lying her across the back seat and brushing her hair off her face before he got back behind the wheel and began to drive towards the house. He didn't have anyone left in his family and he'd be damned if he left before he got some revenge of his own. Lucille had thought they would go down without a fight, but she should've just killed him when she had the chance because he was about to take everything she loved from her. He'd heard her whispering a lot over the past few weeks, always talking about being the lady of the house, so Milo was going to take her house from her. An hour and a half later finds the truck parked in front of Allerdale Hall and Milo making his way to the small storage building. The shed didn't have much in it now that everything had been moved into the house, but there was still two gallons of gas for the lawnmower and Milo knew there was a lighter in the kitchen—he'd hidden it in there himself for when he wanted to sneak a cigarette. As he entered the house again, he could hear screaming and crashing coming from the attic, the noises faint. Obviously Thomas and Lucille were going at it and he hoped his grandfather beat the bitch into the dirt. It would provide distraction enough for Milo to complete his mission at any rate. With one of the gallons in hand and the lighter in his pocket, he starts on the third floor, pouring most of the gas on the moldering books and papers before making his way back to the stairs, going from room to room and picking up small objects on his way—Kady's favorite teddy bear, the beanie he almost always had on, and wedding ring Estelle had picked out for August. Halfway through the second floor, he had to pick up the other gas can to finish up, making sure to cover Emy in gas since she was still unconscious in her daughter's room. Just to make sure she stayed that way, Milo grabbed a heavy lamp and let it drop, denting in part of her cheek. Finally, Milo dumps the last of the gas on the front porch before bringing the Zippo out and lighting the flame. He was hesitant to let it fall, well aware that this could mean destroying Thomas, but the fear of what Lucille might do to somebody else had his hand relaxing and Milo jumping back as the flames climbed high. Weaker than ever, he limps back to the truck long enough to pull Kady out before moving to lie down a few feet from the blazing fire. His sister was snuggled up to his side, skin cold and her breath no longer stirring his hair, but he needed this last moment with her before he said goodbye. Overhead the sky was turning different shades of pink and orange as the sun rose, Milo nodding once and closing his eyes. \"Merry Christmas, Kady,\" he whispers before he goes limp beneath her. The fire blazed on through the rest of the day, the only color to be seen apart from the vermilion snow. In the village, people celebrated with their families, blissfully unaware of the slaughter they would finds weeks later—three burned inside the home, two bodies outside that had been kept intact by the freezing snow surrounding them. No one noticed the people in the half-ruined house that watched as they carted the bodies away, they didn't notice that each of the four phantoms looked exactly like the bodies had before their deaths. What Edith had written in her manuscript was true, that all Sharpes would be damned should they enter Allerdale Hall. But the Hastings were back together, Thomas and Amy were with them, and Lucille and Emy had been banished to walk the narrow clay mines beneath the house. For the first time in weeks, all was well.[Chapter 11] The house had been restored not long after the fire, the Historical Society sending in workers every few weeks to ensure the house stayed in pristine shape in case any tourists wanted to walk the famed halls. After the murders seven years previous, Allerdale Hall had been on any self-respecting ghost hunter's bucket list. People swarmed the property on Halloween, paying buckets of money just to peek around inside and see the ruined elevator that had been August Hasting's doom. No one was quite sure what had happened or who had killed everyone, but most people whispered that the son had gone insane after being stuck in the house for a month with only his family to talk to. They said he'd pushed his father into the unstable elevator, killed the maid and her daughter, and then murdered his sister when she tried to get away. Others said that the Sharpe bloodline was cursed, that it was only a matter of time before the curse took them all out, and it was helped along by the idea everyone had that ghosts were the problem. But all the fear in the world didn't stop the newest group of ghost hunters from driving all the way there, their cars laden down with equipment and food, music playing loudly as the passengers sang along to it. There were five people in all and they couldn't look anymore different. All were in their late teens, but the different styles they sported would be enough to send someone's head spinning—the oldest boy was dressed in designer clothes, the girl next to him sported what she lovingly referred to as hippy-chic, the girl in the back had curly black hair and managed to make a tomboy-styled clothing look girly, while the boy in the other car dressed in rumpled clothing from the night before, and the boy next to him had a style all his own that made him look adorable. The two cars parked in front of the house, everyone getting out to stretch and shooting each other excited grins. This was like their very own Stanley Hotel and they were all hoping to get some evidence before they had to head back to school. \"What did I tell you,\" the hippy, Rachel, asks, bumping her shoulder against the boy to her left. \"Well, it doesn't look too shabby,\" the boy, Mike, replies,\" but if I get lice from this place, you're doing the treatments.\" Rachel just grins, not taking her eyes off the house. It was amazing, like something out of one of her ghost stories. \"Where do you want this, Eggs,\" Benjamin asks, holding one of the heavy bags. His glasses were halfway down his nose, but he never seemed to notice. Before Rachel could answer, Noah spoke up, using his free hand to fix Benjamin's glasses. There was definite chemistry between the two boys, but it was better left as friendship since Noah and Titch were dating. \"Follow me, Benji,\" Noah instructs confidently,\" I'm sure we can find you a room that's not too dusty.\" Titch grins and follows the boys inside with her own bag and the expensive boxed-up tent Mike had generously bought for them all. Mike was loaded, but he made a point not to brag about it, and that was what Rachel liked best about him. Well, that and the way he could scream like a girl whenever his precious hair was mussed. \"Shall we enter the house on haunted hill,\" Mike asks, waggling his fingers in a dramatic attempt at horror. \"After you, my good sir,\" Rachel says with a bow. Mike gains what Rachel called his 'aristocrat' face, the one he pulled whenever he was around super important people and had to be on his best behavior. \"Come along, Eggs. I want to bust me some ghosts.\" As the pair crossed the threshold, Rachel became aware of faint whispering that grew louder the closer she got to the kitchen. Thinking her friends had found something interesting in there, she moves to look inside, finding the room completely empty of people. \"… Think they'll be scared if we slam the shudders ,\" a male voice asked. Rachel smiles, having studied the house's history long enough to know that the voice must've belonged to Milo Hastings. From what she'd read about him in his obituary section, he'd been the type to pull pranks while his sister and father were more subdued. \"Sorry,\" she says by way of answer, enjoying the surprised gasps she got from the ghosts,\" slamming shudders are just part of the job and you'll have to do a lot better than that to get us scared.\" ","Summary":" A great monstrous thing that will devour its host .

Story: Working in the restaurant across from the Cobra Kai dojo, Danielle LaRusso's mom decides to sign her up. Being the only female, Danielle has to learn to deal with overprotective Cobra Kai students and a crush on her sensei. Set as a genderbent AU of the first Karate Kid movie. Spoilers: Yeeeessss.

Warnings: Age difference, initial racism towards Asians, excessive drinking, some violence and language, PTSD, gender roles and gender expectations, societal expectations… Pairings: John Kreese/fem!Daniel, one-sided Cobra Kai/fem!Daniel. White Crane Chapter One: The Road That Could've \"It isn't so bad, right?\" Danielle looked at her mother, and if they hadn't both been LaRusso women, she would have taken her chances on the streets. The apartment building was old and cramped, and she was already missing her old home. \"I hate it,\" Danielle grumbled. \"I want to go back. Why'd we have to move?\" Lucille sighed and ruffled her daughter's hair. \"We moved here to California because I got this new job, baby. Don't worry, you'll get used to things soon. It won't be so bad then.\" Danielle highly doubted that. And Lucille knew that too, hence how she could feel herself agreeing with her daughter to herself as she exited Rocket Computers, disbelieving how they'd gone bankrupt and she was now jobless and having moved for no reason. Just then, a woman came running out of the building across from her, screaming to high heaven. \"I quit, I quit !\" A man came flying out of the building, which Lucille figured out was a restaurant called \"The Orient Express.\" \"You can't quit. You're FIRED!\" The man screamed just as loud. Lucille blinked and then a wide smile spread across her face. She glanced at her watch. A minute until noon and the lunch rush. There was no way she wouldn't get hired. Don't get her wrong. She felt bad for the woman and the fact the other probably was jobless now too…but it wasn't her problem and she didn't know her. What she did know was that the company she was supposed to work for had filed for bankruptcy and she didn't actually have that shiny, new job she'd been promised and had moved all the way to California for, with her upset, teenaged daughter. So she was going to get herself a freaking job to make this sucky day not suck as much, even if it meant working at a restaurant as some waitress. Thankfully though, as she came in and brightly handed in her conveniently there résumé and asked for a job, she wasn't going to be a waitress. She was going to be a hostess, which was marginally better than what she thought she'd get. She had a feeling Danielle wouldn't be pacified by the new turn of luck Lucille had somehow gotten. So she worked through the day, occasionally worrying how Danielle was thinking and how she was going to take Lucille getting a different job. At the end of her shift, successfully handling the customers and earning a grateful bout of thanks from the owner (who had been the man rushing out after that lady), she was leaving the restaurant when the building across from it caught her eye. The Cobra Kai Dojo. Karate, huh? Danielle had been really getting into that lately…Always with a karate book in hand and trying to emulate the pages and teach herself. Maybe she'd be happier about the move and being here if Lucille could sign her up with the place. Deciding to go take a look at the karate dojo, she finished crossing the street and found the door to it, hesitantly entering it. Inside, the lights were still on, but it was almost empty of anyone, minus a tall man who was cleaning up the room. \"Hello?\" she spoke out and then the dirty blond-haired man turned to her in surprise. \"Hello, is there something I can help you with?\" he asked her, smiling slightly. Relaxing a bit, Lucille gave him a bigger smile in return. \"I hope so, yes. I'm Lucille LaRusso. You see, I just moved into the area with my daughter and she hasn't been happy about the move. She does like karate though, so I was wondering if you taught here and if you were accepting new students? And what the prices were for lessons?\" Though caught off guard, the man (quite handsome in Lucille's opinion) recovered quickly. \"I'm Sensei John Kreese,\" he introduced himself. \"I do accept new students. As for how much lessons are…\" he hesitated and Lucille felt disappointment build up. \"Lessons run from $125 every two weeks to $135 monthly.\" Lucille knew she looked disappointed, but she hadn't expected Sensei Kreese to speak up quickly though. \"But we have financial discounts available at around $95 a month. 8-87 if she stuck around after class to help clean up and…uh…chores. I mean, help out with whatever needs to be done around here,\" he ended the offer lamely, sounding unsure. Lucille felt her lips twitch up a little. She had a feeling that that wasn't an actual official pricing, but it was nice of him to have made up the offer. She could actually go for that price though… \"That would be great!\" she accepted, feeling relieved. \"Danielle, my daughter, she could definitely do that, help around with whatever you need. When should she come in?\" \"She could start tomorrow, if she'd like,\" Sensei Kreese told her and Lucille thought that maybe Danielle might finally be a little more happier about this move. \"The only other thing I'd add on is that the class is currently all males, so if she's alright with that, then everything should be fine.\" Lucille wanted to wince. She wasn't sure how that was going to go down with Danielle, but hopefully not too bad. \"I think she'll be fine,\" Lucille answered him, trying not to sound so uncertain. \"I work across the dojo at The Orient Express restaurant, so I can send her here after school.\" \"Class usually starts on weekdays around 4-5, so she'll probably be early then. If she does come in early, I can have her help set up the place with me and catch her up to where everyone else is in the class.\" \"Perfect then. She'll see you tomorrow, Sensei Kreese!\" They exchanged last minute information, she quickly filled out a form, and then she was off to go home to her currently miserable daughter and hopefully cheer her up with the news. When Lucille LaRusso finally left, John thought he might have been a little off balanced at the moment from the encounter. New students was pretty rare, so that in itself had been an unexpected overture from her. But then to say it was her daughter who wanted to attend… Well, it was going to be a different change of pace at least. He had only taught boys, and before that the men in his old army unit. It wasn't like his dojo specifically excluded girls…it just had never had any, and girls weren't usually interested. And after a while, it was just assumed it was an all-male dojo. And then there was the whole pricing thing. He did offer discounts through financial aid, but the whole $87 deal wasn't actually a real thing. He'd kind of came up with that on the spot, as well as the helping out around the dojo. He'd just felt…bad about the money thing, especially when he'd seen her face. Usually, he was the hard-nosed, strict and unsympathetic kind of character, but he'd always been kind of softer for the women, and between Mrs. LaRusso and the daughter he had yet to meet, it hadn't been that hard to make him try to bend rules around. His phone rang and he saw the Caller ID. Rolling his eyes, he answered it with a sarcastic \"Can I help you?\" \"Don't be mean, John!\" his old friend Terry Silver mouthed out to him. \"You know you love me.\" \"Whatever,\" John grumbled. \"What do you want?\" \"Hmph, Mr. Grump. Anyway, just checking we still on for beers tonight. I need a normal outing, where I don't have to deal with lawyers or old guys annoying me about stocks and decisions I make about my own company.\" John headed towards a door in the back of the dojo next to his office and went in, spotting his bed and dumping his jacket on it. \"If you wear your suits, I'm sitting as far away from you as possible. And if you wear an ascot with it, I don't know you.\" Terry laughed at the other end of the phone. \"Jeans and a shirt then.\" John actually released a relieved sigh. Terry really did have a strange sense of fashion sometimes, as well as wearing suits to places he really shouldn't. Like the bar they frequented at together somedays. That's why, as he entered Jerry's, he was doubly relieved to find that Terry really was wearing a regular shirt and jeans combo. He slipped into the seat next to Terry and ordered a bottle of beer, before greeting his friend with a shit-eating grin. \"Glad you're not looking like a priss today,\" John told him. \"I don't look like a priss,\" Terry huffed. \"I look sharp. Professional. Women love me in my suits.\" John scoffed, but didn't say anything. He took a sip of his beer. \"So how's the dojo going?\" Terry asked, sipping at his glass of whiskey like it was a glass of wine. John nearly snorted. \"It's fine,\" he focused on the question. \"Kids are learning to be tough shits and not back down. Make sure not to underestimate their enemy.\" Terry nodded. \"Sounds good to me.\" John hesitated then. \"I, uh, got a new student today. Well, a mother came in asking about classes.\" Terry sat up in excitement. \"Oh yeah? That's good, ain't it?\" \"Yeah…But, uh, it's going to be different. Strange maybe.\" His friend furrowed his eyebrows. \"Different? Strange? What the hell you mean, John?\" \"I've got a female student for the first time,\" John said wryly. \"I haven't met her yet, but she's starting tomorrow.\" Terry stared at him. \"…You're shitting me, right?\" John rubbed the back of his neck. \"Nah. I got her coming in tomorrow, probably early enough that she'll help me set up the dojo before the boys come in.\" Terry whistled. \"That is something new. I don't know. Can you do it?\" \"What do you mean 'can I do it?'\" John asked defensively. The other man held up his hands. \"You teach pretty rough, John. It's pretty gruff on the boys, because you've styled yourself and your teaching more military, so how're you going to handle a girl into the mix? Can you teach a girl?\" \"Yeah, I can,\" John said hotly, and damn it he would. Maybe he might have to retool his teachings a bit, but he was sure he could teach her. Terry held up his hands higher. \"Okay, okay! I got you. It'll be really weird though, right? I mean, I know we've got women in the military. There are girls taking martial arts lessons in other places or boxing too, but it's rare around these parts and you and the dojo don't have any experience in that at all.\" \"I can do it,\" John said again, reassuring more himself. The hell. It seemed like serving in Afghanistan was much easier. Terry patted his back. \"Don't worry about it. I bet you'll do fine, John. Anyway, tomorrow you're being thrown into the water, so it's not like you have any choice but to sink or swim then,\" he ended cheerily. John glared at him. Some friend. Still, he did feel a bit of doubt creeping in again, and he actually wasn't so sure about teaching Danielle LaRusso his brand of karate. And he hadn't even begun worrying about how the boys would take to having a girl in their midst, and learning alongside them. He groaned. \"I'm doomed,\" he muttered. Terry snickered at him.

White Crane Chapter Two: She Ain't Havin' It Danielle moped around the apartment. She had no friends and she had nowhere to go to –she didn't know where to go. It was a new city and she was alone, while her mom went off to work. She tried playing her guitar for a bit, but she only managed an hour of that before her mind wandered back to the fact she had just left everything behind. Not that she had anything back in Jersey. She had been a loner there too, but at least there had been familiar and she knew how to get around and what to do. Los Angeles was something else though. It was large and bustling with people and noises everywhere. She had never been there before and she didn't know where to go, much less the fact that she was still friendless. It was warmer too. Even if it was nearing the end of summer, she could tell that California was much warmer than New Jersey. She was sure that – A loud knock on her door interrupted her and she frowned, heading over to the door to peer through the small eyehole. She saw an unfamiliar teenage boy outside. \"Who is it?\" she asked. \"Hi! I'm Freddy. You don't know me yet, but I'm one of your neighbors. I heard the new neighbors were moving in today and that there was going to be a teenager my age. There aren't many kids around here, so I thought I'd come say hiya!\" Danielle debated with herself, but she did want to make friends. The guy was overly energetic though, but eh. Beggars can't be choosers. She opened the door and shyly waved. \"Hi, I'm Danielle. I just moved in. Please to meet you.\" He blinked before giving a shy smile back. \"U-uh, hey there! So I was wondering if you wanted to hang out or something? There's a beach that's nearby that we can go to too, where a few of my other friends will be around.\" \"Beach?\" Danielle perked up. There were beaches in New Jersey, but there she had never really gone to them, especially since she would have been alone. \"Yeah!\" Freddy became more energized again. \"It might be cold since it's getting late and it's almost not summer, but it should still be nice to hang out there!\" \"Okay, sounds like fun,\" Danielle beamed at him. \"Let me just get dress for if it's cold out there. Want to come in?\" \"Uh, s-sure!\" She opened the door and let him in, and she hurried to change. Shorts would be alright, maybe? But if it's cold…then some jeans. She could just put on a hoodie and a beanie to keep warm, which she did next, making sure her beanie covered her ears and kept them warm before she tucked in her hair. She met back up with Freddy and they left her apartment behind, while they talked about themselves on the way to the beach. She noted he had a soccer ball with him, which excited her since it was one of the few things she was good at. \"I love soccer,\" she told him. \"It was one of the few things in P.E. I participated in.\" \"Really?\" Freddy was grinning. \"How good are you?\" \"Not bad,\" she thought about it. \"I think I'm pretty decent at it.\" \"Awesome! Maybe you could show me and the guys back on the beach, eh?\" She laughingly agreed just as they finally reached the beach, to where some of his friends were already at. She dimly noted that there was a group of girls hanging out too, though they were all just sitting on some blankets and just listening to music. She went back to paying attention to Freddie as he led her to his friends and introduced her and she greeted them hello back. They decided on starting a pickup game, and she played on Freddie's team. \"Ah, geez, Danielle! Decent? You're great at this!\" Danielle gave a sheepish grin, though she felt giddy at the compliment. She kept playing on, not noticing one of the other girls on the beach had come closer. \"Hi,\" the blonde-haired girl surprised Danielle. \"I'm Ali. I haven't seen you around before…?\" \"Ah, I'm Danielle,\" her eyes widened. \"Um, I just moved here actually.\" Ali smiled widely. \"That's great! We should hang out sometime and maybe I'll even see you at West Valley. You'll be going there, right?\" \"That would be nice,\" Danielle was quickly warming up to the friendly female. \"And yeah, I am!\" \"So what are you doing?\" Ali pointed at the ball. \"I'm playing soccer with the guys,\" Danielle held up the ball, before beginning to toss it up and then catch it. She even showed off a bit, using her feet and knees to do some tricks. \"Wow, you're really good,\" she said impressed, but before she could continue on, there were loud roars of engines and a bunch of boys had driven by the beach before parking their…m-motorbikes? What in the world were those? Danielle frowned as she watched those boys marched down the hill to the beach, heading towards them. She yelped as the leader, obviously the blond boy in front of them, pushed her aside and confronted Ali. \"So, you're hanging around here, huh?\" \"Yeah, so?\" Ali said dismissively. \"Why do you care, Johnny? We've been broken up for two weeks.\" 'Johnny' seemed to have puffed up at that, looking agitated. \"Which was a mistake on your part!\" Ali snorted. \"Your ego is larger than you can handle. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Go away.\" Furious, Johnny stormed over to the radio that was playing and shut it off, making Ali get pissed off in turn. Danielle blinked, wondering if she and everyone else had suddenly been dropped in the middle of a lovers spat or something. \"Give me that!\" Ali screamed at him. \"No! Not until you agree to talk to me!\" Johnny shouted back, holding it threateningly over his head. \"Or I'll drop it!\" \"You jerk! I said give it back !\" Deciding to interfere, Danielle came closer. \"Hey, come on, guys. Let's just cool our heads, alright. Listen, man, put down her radio,\" Danielle guessed it was Ali's. She was getting mad over it after all. \"Don't interfere!\" Johnny snarled at her. Danielle scowled outright now and stood between them, glaring at him. \"Get off your high horse, Mister! You're the one who gatecrashed and interrupted, so put down the radio and butt off!\" Johnny dropped the radio and stomped over to Danielle, who stood up straight and didn't back down. When Johnny tried to get around her to get to Ali, she pushed him roughly and he retaliated by grabbing her arm and twisting it behind her, pushing her down into the sandy ground painfully and pulling a cry out of her. However, as he pushed her down more and his hand reached around her a little more to get a better grip on her while his other hand had her arm, he grabbed something he shouldn't have, at the same time as her beanie came off. But Danielle was way more focused on his hand on her breast, not even caring or noticing how it had become quiet and still. \"You…you asshole!\" she screamed and gained a burst of energy to break out of his suddenly slacked hold, head-butting him backwards and pretty sure she hit him straight in the face. \"You freaking pervert!\" \"W-what?! N-no! That wasn't…I hadn't!\" But she wasn't paying attention to what he was saying, instead kicking him in the stomach and then sucker punching him in the shoulder. Then she whirled around and began storming out of there, intent on heading home before she could be further embarrassed and pissed off. She may not know karate (yet, dammit!), but she was pretty damn good at boxing and she also did cardio kickboxing with her mom, thank you very much! Danielle didn't stop until she was all the way back home and decided to take a shower when she got in. Unfortunately, the water heater wasn't working and she had to endure a cold shower, further giving her a bad mood. After cleaning up and getting dressed, she decided to search out the apartment complex's maintenance man, and found the small place he seemed to work in. \"Hello?\" She tried to keep her tone even. \"Yes?\" An old Japanese man appeared and looked at her inquisitively. She gave him a feeble smile. \"Um, my apartment's water heater isn't working, so if you could take a look at it when you can?\" \"Of course, of course,\" he gave a friendly smile. \"Mr. Miyagi will take a look at it tomorrow.\" She gave a more unsure smile, but inwardly shrugged it off. She was also wondering if the man was referring to himself in the third person, but decided not to ask. \"Okay then. I'll see you tomorrow?\" She gave a small wave goodbye and then headed back to the apartment to wait for her mom. Deciding to change into clothes she can sleep in, she slipped off her pants and shirt, and found her San Diego's Chargers jersey and put that on, leaving her legs bare. She'd always been hot-blooded, and her trip out had proven that California's cold temperatures weren't really that cold to her, so she definitely didn't need to pile on the clothes. Time passed and she played with her guitar a little more, idly even making some beginning pieces to songs, before her mom finally came and she straightened up. \"Hey,\" her mom said cheerily. \"You wouldn't believe the day I had! Whoo boy.\" Danielle gave her an unimpressed stare. \"Try my day.\" Lucille rolled her eyes. \"Oh don't be such a drama queen, Danielle. Tell me all about it then.\" And so Danielle did, even including the sort-of fight at the beach. \"That poor boy,\" Lucille commented, causing Danielle to sputter. \"What? I was the one who was assaulted!\" \"Dear, I'm pretty sure that you not only broke his nose, gave a large bruise to his shoulder and his stomach –you are not a light girl, Danielle, or forgiving! –and I'm pretty sure you humiliated him in front of everyone. And accused him of being a pervert.\" Danielle grumbled. \"Well, he is. And he deserved all that.\" Lucille just shook her head. \"Well, I'm just glad that nice maintenance man will be coming tomorrow to fix our water heater. I didn't even know it was messed up!\" Danielle made an agreeing noise, flipping through the karate book she'd brought over from New Jersey. Lucille noticed. \"So, my job didn't pan out,\" Lucille hesitantly started, which made Danielle perk up in interest. \"Does that mean we can go back to Jersey?\" Lucille sighed. \"No. Honey, we drove all that freaking way from there to here, resolved and resigned everything back there, and already gotten started on living here. It's not plausible.\" Danielle echoed her sigh. \"However, I was able to find a job at the Chinese restaurant across from where I was supposed to work,\" Lucille tacked on. Danielle scrunched up her nose. \"So you're a waitress instead of a computer programmer. That's…an upgrade,\" she said sarcastically. Lucille swatted at her daughter's head. \"Shush you! And no, I'm not a waitress. I'm a hostess.\" Danielle almost asked if there was a difference, when she shut her mouth at her mom's warning look. \"But I found something that might cheer you up –\" \"Doubtful,\" Danielle said immediately, flipping a page. \"I found a karate center that's willing to take you in.\" Danielle pushed away her book and sat up, eyes widening as she looked at her mom in excitement. But then she became skeptical. \"Do we have money for it? Classes are expensive.\" Lucille waved her off. \"Don't worry about it. The owner and teacher said we can have a bargain price if you agree to come in early and help set up for class and help clean up afterwards. Well, technically he said you could just help clean up after class, but since you'll probably get there early, he mentioned you could help set up and that he'd probably also help you catch up to where everyone else is in class.\" \"Done,\" Danielle agreed. What was more chores? She was already stuck cleaning up and taking care of where they lived now, and back when they lived in Jersey, because her mom wasn't around a lot and had to work to make sure everything got paid and they had food on the table. So what if she had to help around somewhere else too? Big deal. Her mom was hesitating though. \"Yeah, he also mentioned that the class was only full of boys at the moment. Are you okay with that?\" Oh. That…that might be a problem? \"No?\" she answered, but it sounded too questioning to be taken seriously. Danielle sighed. Well, it shouldn't be that bad. Right? Started 1/23/17 – Completed 1/23/17 A/n: So Johnny's going to be ragged on by the others, especially Ali, for a loooong time. Doubtful Danielle's going to let this go easily either~ Didn't plan on having Mr. Miyagi come so soon, but eh. Here he is. Also, I really wanted to finish \"The Things I Can Do Without\" first before working on this Karate Kid fic, but I got in the mood and I thought maybe it might not be so bad to try to update every once and a while. I might make the pairing include Terry because poor guy's got nothing for him in fandom and I already have a few just Danielle/Kreese fics. Next chapter should have Danielle meeting Kreese and maybe another meeting between her and the Cobra Kai. In any case, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter and please remember to review! Anon Reviews: 1. Guest 1: Yeah, I'll to update more often, though my original plans had been to wait until my other Karate Kid fic was finished. 2. Guest 2: Thanks. I'll updating more now. 3. BLZ: Haha, thanks. I'm not planning on giving up on this (I've already planned out practically most of it), but I had plans on starting this a little later on. I decided to try working on it more now though, since I've been in the mood, and I've been really wanting to work on it anyway. 4. kagome higurashi: Thanks and I will be trying to write more. 5. Guest 3: Look, I'll try to update more –I've got a life, my dad just passed away, and I'm just trying to get in a mood to try to write and update regularly.

White Crane Chapter Three: When There's a God (And He Just Wants to Laugh at You) \"You look bored,\" her mother noted, watching her daughter sleepily make breakfast. \"I'm sleepy, not bored,\" Danielle snarked. \"Yeah, but I'm betting you'll be bored.\" Danielle looked over her shoulder at her mom, frowning at her and wondering what she was getting at. \"You want to come with me, so you can check out the dojo? It's across from my work, so since I'm heading to work in a little while, you can come with and go check it out,\" Lucille suggested. \"Your class will begin later on, but getting there early could be good.\" Danielle hesitated, like she had the night before when her mom first told her about the karate dojo. Don't get her wrong, she wanted to take lessons and learn karate for real. Self-teaching and going by books wasn't going to cut it and could only get so far. It was a great opportunity and the bargain price wasn't going to be something she could get just anywhere. But it was full of boys and she wasn't sure how okay she was going to be with that. She had no problems hanging with the boys and all, but taking a class (and a karate class at that!) and being the only girl was just something different. \"Yeah, sure. Sounds good,\" she said anyway, even though she was anything but sure. That's why she found herself helping her mom getting the car running and then heading to her work with her. Once they'd parked near the restaurant, her mom pointed out the dojo before leaving her to it and going into the restaurant to start the day and get to work. Danielle had made it to the entrance of the dojo, stared blankly at the door, before turning around and heading to the restaurant and entering. Since the place was just opening, there were no customers. Her mother quickly saw her and came over. \"Danielle, what's wrong?\" She stared at her mother. \"Can I have some water?\" she asked feebly. Soon enough, Danielle found herself repeating the same pattern –going up to the entrance and then retreating cowardly back to the restaurant. Her mother didn't say a word, except give her knowing and pitiable looks. So John had woken up, already stressed out from the day and trying to figure out how he was going to teach that day's class. A girl . He was going to teach a freaking girl for the first time. \"Holy shit,\" John muttered, running a hand through his hair. He took a deep breath and decided to focus on getting ready for the day. He took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed his teeth, and then was back to wondering about what he was going to do soon enough. \"Strike first, strike hard, no mercy,\" he muttered. \"How the fuck am I going to tell that to a girl?!\" His cell phone rang and he answered it in annoyance, barely glancing at the Caller ID and recognizing Terry's number. \"What is it, Terry?\" he answered, voice disgruntled. \"Good morning! Today's the big day, eh?\" \"Fuck you.\" He abruptly hung up and ignored his phone, especially as it rang again. It was probably Terry again, and a quick glance showed that it was the jerk's number. John sighed to himself before he saw someone by his entrance and he looked closer, seeing it was a girl. Speak of a girl and one appears! Why was everything messing with him already? He continued to watch her, not getting a clear picture of her from where he was standing, but watching as she seemed to just stand there before suddenly leaving. He raised an eyebrow but shook his head, wondering what that was all about. However, ten minutes later, she appeared again and was staring at the dojo's door. He blinked and was just about to head to the door and open it to ask if she needed something, when she turned and left again. Now thoroughly confused, he thought that maybe he should just put it out of his mind since it wasn't like he could really figure out what was up since she wasn't around anymore. He was starting to clean up a bit, when five minutes passed and the girl was there. This time she had managed to reach for the door, but yanked her hand back as if it was burned, and even quicker turned around and ran away this time. John found himself confused, before it clicked in his head. That girl had to be Danielle LaRusso. And apparently she was having a lot of hesitation entering his dojo and participating, and is probably going back and forth between his door to the restaurant across the street that her mother was supposed to work in. \"Hell, I guess I'm not the only one that's hesitant about this whole situation,\" he muttered. He grabbed his keys and exited his dojo, locking it up and heading across the street, where he entered the Chinese restaurant. He saw Lucille LaRusso first, who looked momentarily surprised to see him before looked understanding. \"Back there, sitting alone at one of the tables,\" she told him in exasperation. \"Please don't mind her.\" \"It's alright, Ms. LaRusso,\" he told her. \"I have this.\" He went in the direction she'd pointed out and managed to see a booth that had only a single girl sitting at it, playing morosely with a packet of sugar and sipping at a glass of water. She was pretty up close, with her olive skin and her short brown hair. Just as she flicked the packet a little too hard and it soared in the air, he quickly snatched it out of the air and held it up, causing her to startle and stare at him. He was startled too, as he got a better look at her face, taken aback by her doe brown eyes and cute button nose that was matched up to soft lips. He mentally shook himself out of it and gave her a friendly smile. \"Hey there, I'm Sensei John Kreese from across the street. Your mom told me about you a little yesterday,\" he said lightly. She shifted before biting her lower lip uncertainly. \"I'm Danielle,\" she said quietly, her accent way different than her mother's Jersey one. \"I-I'm supposed to be in your class.\" He slid into the seat opposite her in the booth and continued to smile at her, trying to put her at ease. \"You know, I've never taught a girl before,\" he told her. \"Really?\" she asked in surprise. He shook his head. \"Nah. I was kind of freaked out myself about it, and wondering what to do,\" he admitted, thinking it'd help comfort her. Otherwise, he'd never admit something like that, or any other weakness to anyone. She perked up a little and she started to smile a little herself. \"Oh, I thought I'd be the only one nervous,\" she confessed to him. \"I kind of psyched myself out the entire time last night, and then Mom brought me to let me check out your dojo and I couldn't even bring myself to open the door.\" He laughed. \"Yeah, I know. I saw you a few times come up to it, and this last time is when I figured it out and figured out who you were, so I decided to come over here and maybe talk you over.\" She gave him a sheepish look, her smile briefly being bashful. \"I'm pretty sure you missed the dozen or so times before then that I tried to enter your dojo.\" He barked out a laugh. \"Did I then? Well, I can tell you this. It'll be as new to me as it is to you, but probably won't be as bad as either one of us think it'll be. And don't mind the boys –they're all good kids and will help you out. Why don't you come over? I still have to get you a correctly sized gi, considering all the sizes I have are fit for boys, so I have to see if the smallest size I found will at least fit you a little.\" \"Oh! Okay. I can help out with anything right now too, if you need,\" she said, turning a bit shy. He gave her a reassuring look as he got out of the booth. \"Sure, that would be helpful.\" He began to lead the way, with her following him, and the two of them passed by her mother, who gave them a bright look. \"Good luck! Have fun, Danielle, and thank you a lot, Mr. Kreese!\" John Kreese was the karate instructor she was learning from. He was actually rather handsome and she also quickly learned that he had a dry humor. But he seemed nice and she didn't feel as weirded out by the thought of being the only girl in an all-boys karate class as she had been. They checked out the uniform he'd found and even before putting it on, they both knew it was just a little bit too big. She hmmed as she eyed it before turning to him. \"Do you have medical tape?\" she asked, catching him off guard. \"Yeah, I do. Hold on a bit,\" he said and left her for a moment, coming back soon enough. \"Ah, thanks! Where can I change?\" He stared at her before a look of realization crossed his face and he grimaced a bit. He gestured for her to follow him and he showed her the changing room. \"Um, this is where the boys change. If you're early, you can change in here. If you come in around the same time, I guess you could change in my room until we find a more appropriate solution,\" he told her, looking apologetic. She nodded, hiding her amusement, and believing more than ever that what he said about never teaching a girl being true as he left her in consternation. She quickly changed and folded up the sleeves of her arm and legs, and then used the medical tape around those areas. She also used the medical tape around her fingers, before finishing up and heading back out. John –Sensei Kreese? What did she call him? Ehhh, she was usually informal anyway…–looked surprised, but quickly looked approving. \"Good idea. That should fix up your uniform until I can order you something more fitting,\" he said. \"Why'd you tape your fingers?\" \"Oh! Um, when I used to do boxing, I learned about hand wraps to protect joints and stuff, so when I got interested in karate, I was wondering if there was any need for it, and I saw that a lot of martial artists tend to tape up the fingers in certain ways. I learned about it then and practiced.\" Sensei blinked before taking one of her hands and examining it. \"Interesting,\" he muttered. \"You said you did boxing?\" She nodded cheerily. \"I used to be interested and practiced gymnastics, then boxing at the YMCA. But then I got into karate and tried to learn it there and through books, but I doubt it's anything like learning in here, Mr. Kreese.\" He let go of her and gave her a wide smile. \"The students call me Sensei or Sensei Kreese. This is interesting,\" he said again as he pointed at her fingers. \"I'll have to look it up. Usually, I know about taping fingers and hands for medical purposes and to help prevent further injury. You said you used to practice boxing? Let's see how your punches are.\" He got a couple of punching mitts that he never use anymore, in regards to his regular students, and then held it up to her. \"Get into any stance you're familiar with and good at, whether it's a karate stance or boxing,\" he said, trying to get a gauge. She moved into a semi-familiar stance that he scrunched his eyebrows at, but prepared himself for when she launched a punch. His eyebrows flew up as he nearly was pushed back. She had a punch , this girl… \"You definitely have strength behind your punches, probably from your boxing experience,\" he said, impressed. \"That stance though –looks familiar but not quite? Where'd you learn it?\" It wasn't quite boxing and wasn't quite karate after all. She beamed at him. \"I learned it from my old cardio kickboxing class I went to with my mom back in Jersey.\" Cardio…kickboxing? He almost laughed, but held it in. He gave a wry grin in return. \"I'm guessing your kicks are going to be just as good?\" They practiced a bit, with John trying to figure out what she needed to learn. Sure she needed the basics, but she was damn good at kicking and punching, that was for sure. He could get her caught up on stances at least, and with her work ethic and ability to learn fast, she could get that in a week. Maybe next week, he could see about pitting her up against one of the others privately, someone a bit more softer than most of his students…like Bobby. Yeah, Bobby would be a good partner for her, would take in her newness and be patient with her. They were taking a break at her mom's restaurant, eating a late lunch and drinking a lot of water, and he thought it'd probably be good to get to know her, considering he knew the others since they've practically been with him forever. The first thing he wanted to ask about though was her accent. It really was different from her mom's, since her mom had an obvious Jersey accent and he'd been expecting Danielle would have one too. \"Your mom's got a Jersey accent, so I was surprised to hear you didn't,\" he said and saw her look confused before she suddenly nodded. \"Ah, yeah. My household back in Jersey was split. There was most of it that had Italian accents and the others that had gained Jersey accents. My mom spent more time outside of the house and around people, so her accent gravitated towards more of the Jersey side. I was the opposite.\" \"I see. What made you guys move here?\" he asked next and was amused to see a pouty look cross her face. \"Mom got a new job here,\" she grumbled. \"She was supposed to be a computer programmer, but the people who promised her a job ended up having to declare bankrupt, so we basically came here for no reason. She managed to get this hostess job when she left the building for the computer job, and apparently some crazy lady ran out of here screaming about quitting and the owner screaming that she was fired. Since it was lunch rush coming up and she was already here, you can guess that she obviously got the job.\" John chuckled. \"It's alright –Los Angeles isn't too bad. There are plenty of places for you to go around and enjoy, so you'll find yourself enjoying yourself soon enough.\" Her lips twitched. \"Well, I guess it hasn't been too bad so far. I got into this really awesome karate class after all,\" she said slyly, which made John smirk and wink at her. \"Plus, I can get back at that pervert I met last night, if I ever see him again!\" John straightened up, frowning. \"Pervert?\" \"Yeah,\" Danielle was starting to get heated. \"I was at a beach get-together my new neighbor invited me to, when this bunch of jerks came by on their fancy motorbikes and came to pick a fight. The leader, some asshole blond –er, 'scuse the language, Sensei, but he totally deserves it –came stomping down and was picking on this girl I just met named Ali and who I was just starting to become friends with. Well, this punkass had the nerve to grab my arm and twist it behind my back and push me to the ground, and get this, Sensei! He totally groped my breast! He's totally a pervert, right?!\" John was pretty sure his face had become so pale that he looked dead. Seriously. He had more than a good clue who those \"bunch of jerks\" were, and more importantly who that \"asshole blond\" was. What was Johnny and those kids getting up to? And he knew it was Johnny, especially considering Ali being talked about. Johnny had been griping about how he'd been dumped by the girl for a few weeks now, and while he and the others had commiserated with him (Guy Code and all), John was sure that kid probably earned being dumped. Not that that had stopped Johnny from being persistent. But now Johnny had gone and used violence against a girl a-a-and groped her?! Oh God, those two were going to have class together in fifteen minutes ! Started 1/28/17 – Completed 1/29/17 A/n: So I would like to at least finish the first arc, which is sort of really short. But yeah, at least John and Danielle finally meet! Next chapter should be Danielle's \"reunion\" with the Cobra Kai guys~ I hope everyone liked this chapter, so please remember to leave a review! Anon Reviews: 1. Guest: Thanks! Glad you enjoy this and my other stories. I'm going to definitely try to update a little for this one, at least for a while, so look forward to more coming up![Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I blame marathons of Karate Kid movies on TV for making me writing fanfic of it, haha. Story: Working in the restaurant across from the Cobra Kai dojo, Danielle LaRusso's mom decides to sign her up. Being the only female, Danielle has to learn to deal with overprotective Cobra Kai students and a crush on her sensei. Set as a genderbent AU of the first Karate Kid movie. Spoilers: Yeeeessss. Yes, yes, yes. Beware? Warnings: Age difference, excessive drinking, some violence and language, PTSD, gender roles and gender expectations, societal expectations… Pairings: John Kreese/fem!Daniel, maybe Terry Silver/fem!Daniel, one-sided Cobra Kai/fem!Daniel. White Crane Chapter Four: Joke's On You John admitted it. To only himself of course, but he admitted it. He'd run away like a coward. He had ended up laughing nervously, made up some excuse that he needed to make a call that he just remembered, and that she could come back to the dojo after she was done eating and even had time to look around the block at the stores before class began. He didn't know whether to kill Johnny or toss the kid at her as a sacrifice. This was all the kid's doing after all! Why'd he have to pick on the one girl who was going to end up being a classmate? No, strike that. Why did Johnny have to grope her? That was totally the biggest offense. Yes, yes, that's right. No, it was ALL wrong and the two of them were going to meet soon and clash in class and oh God it was going to be such a nightmare –He was hoping Johnny called in sick for once. Even if the others recognized Danielle, it wouldn't be as bad as it would be if it was Danielle confronting Johnny. He found himself calling Terry because he didn't know what else to do. Even if his friend was being an asshole, at least he'd commiserate with John over this new turn of events. \"John! You actually called? Wow, that's –\" John cut off Terry's sarcastic quip. \"Shut up. It's about Danielle.\" \"Wait, you sound like you'd already met her! How'd it go? What did you guys do? Is she cute?\" John once again cut him off. \"Never mind that! I'll tell you later. Right now, I need advice.\" That made Terry intrigued, since he'd tried to earlier and had been rebuffed harshly. Okay, so maybe he mostly wanted to heckle and mess with John, but he'd been willing to impart advice too! \"Yeah? What's up? I've never taught a girl too, but you know, I could probably think of something.\" \"Yeah, no. I have a different issue,\" John grumbled. \"You know one of my students? Johnny Lawrence? Yeah, apparently those two, and the rest of Johnny's crew, already met and it didn't go so well. According to her, Johnny physically attacked her and then groped her, uh, breast. Yeah. And they're going to meet in…\" he looked at the clock, \"5 minutes.\" \"Oh,\" Terry said. \"Shit.\" \"My thoughts exactly. What do I do?\" \"Offer the kid up as a sacrifice,\" Terry said seriously. \"Thou shall not get in the way of a woman's wrath.\" John groaned, but that had been his thought too. \"She might murder him.\" \"Mmhm.\" \"I might go to jail as an accomplice for not doing anything.\" \"I'll bail you two out.\" John burst out laughing, running a hand through his hair. \"Ah well, I guess that's that. Should I even try to help Johnny somehow?\" He could practically hear Terry's shrug through the phone. \"I guess. Just to say you tried and you did your duty as a teacher. Otherwise, retreat veeeery far away, my man. It's going to be a slaughter.\" John grimaced. \"That's what I'm afraid of,\" he heard noise outside his office and sighed. \"I gotta go. Talk to you later.\" \"Yeah, sure, sure. Let's grab a beer or something. See you!\" John took a deep breath and refrained from hitting his head against the wall. It would've been nice to be unconscious for this though… He walked out and caught the tail end of the guys teasing Johnny, and winced when he heard what about. \"Haha, Johnny the Perv!\" \"S-shut up, Dutch! I told you, it wasn't like that! Damn it, it was a fucking accident!\" \"Really, Johnny? I think you were just being smooth and snuck in a grope!\" \"Shut up, guys! I mean it!\" John twitched. Johnny was pissed. The guys wasn't letting that stupid time go, and now the rest of the class was coming in and hearing them, and wondering what they were talking about. Dutch was snickering, ignoring his glare. \"Dude, you started it. You're the one who wanted to storm down to the beach and start shit.\" His face flushed red. \"I know, I know. Fuck, I messed up alright? Damn it, I shouldn't have even grabbed her arm like that –b-but I didn't even know she was a girl! I thought he was a freaking pretty boy and he was hitting up Ali, so I got even more pissed with him –her! Her, I mean.\" He grabbed at his hair and pulled. Oh, he screwed up royally. He was so glad his parents didn't know about this, more so that he'd accidentally –it really was an accident! –ended up grabbing onto that girl's breast. He hadn't meant to, but he had. And with her beanie coming off and the fact his hand was touching something it wasn't supposed to, had led to the understanding that he and friends realized that 'he' was actually a 'she'. \"Hey, boys,\" he heard their sensei and they turned around to face him. However, Johnny balked. Their teacher, despite his smile, looked anything but happy, and there was a pissed look in his eyes that had Johnny thinking that maybe he should run away. \"What's this about a girl?\" Johnny stared wide-eyed at his teacher. However, he wasn't the only one. The others around him fidgeted and had quieted down. Sensei Kreese growled something and shook his head. \"Oh forget it, I already know what happened.\" Wait, what?! How? \"Anyway, Johnny, you have three seconds to start bowing and scraping.\" Huh? What did he – Sensei Kreese moved around them and towards the door. \"Hey, Danielle! Welcome to your first class!\" Johnny grew cold. Even though he didn't know her name and hadn't seen her yet, he knew exactly who it was that had entered the dojo, simply because of Sensei Kreese's warning. \"Hey, Sensei! I'm really excited to meet everyone!\" Johnny cursed under his breath, recognizing the voice, and looked for an exit. He needed to run away, hide, something! He was not prepared for this meeting. \"Oh, fuck,\" he heard Dutch mutter. Well, at least Johnny wasn't the only one. \"Danielle, let me introduce you to everyone. Guys, this is Danielle LaRusso. She'll be learning with us from now on. Danielle, this is Mr. Lawrence .\" \"No, no, no, no,\" he started muttering, not wanting to look around. But then a hand clasped hard on his shoulder and he looked up to see his sensei grinning slightly evilly at him, turning him around to face Danielle because his body was frozen and unable to move or resist. ' No, Sensei, why?!' He winced when he locked eyes with Danielle, seeing her clearly this time. There was no mistaking her as not a girl, what with her doe eyes, soft lips and slim face. Man, he was stupid and blind. And screwed too, by the murderous look that appeared on her face when she caught sight of him. \"H-hi,\" his voice actually squeaked. Danielle's face immediately smoothed over and she plastered a smile on her face. It was in no way in hell genuine. \"Please to meet you,\" she barely withheld the snarl. Johnny tried to inconspicuously move a few steps back, but Sensei Kreese's hand locked him down. The other guys, except for the others in class outside his group, all had a similar subdued and cowed reaction to greeting Danielle, who (while not as harshly as with him) barely greeted them kindly. \"Alright, class. Let's start with warm ups,\" Sensei Kreese announced. \"Danielle, why don't you stay closer to the front and me, so you can see more clearly how the class is run and how to do the steps. Mr. Brown, I want you positioned next to her, so that if she needs help or has questions and I'm not there to help, you can help her.\" Johnny let out a relieved breath, glad it wasn't him. He felt sympathy for Bobby though, who looked like a deer caught in headlights, but better him than Johnny. There was no way he was going anywhere near her, when she was practically glaring holes into him. Several times though, through class, Sensei Kreese did his usual random reaction test and would throw whoever onto the matt if they weren't paying attention…but it seemed as if he was paying particular focus on Johnny and the others (Johnny specifically). It hurt like hell, but he suppose this was supposed to be penance or something. Or at least he hoped it would, because he really just wanted everyone to forget the incident and not talk about it anymore. He was beyond embarrassed now, and would like for it to all go away. \"Okay, sparring time. Mr. Lawrence , I've got a special task for you,\" Sensei Kreese said, putting emphasis on his name that boded no good will. \"I need you to help Danielle practice her punches and kicks.\" He looked at his sensei in betrayal before looking at Danielle like the very deer in headlights look he said Bobby had. She was staring at him impassionedly before a smile began to slowly stretch across her face. \"Hey,\" Tommy whispered to him. \"Before you die, can you will your Xbox One to me?\" Johnny gulped. It hurt like hell . Her punches and kicks had a hell of a strength behind them and she missed a few times –a few times too many, especially with that broad smile on her face! He was sure that she'd done it on purpose. Also, he knew he spied those punching mitts to the side, but his sensei didn't offer them and even kicked them out of sight before Johnny and Danielle had begun. \"Um, Danielle,\" he started. \"Yes?\" she scowled at him. \"Look, I'm really sorry,\" he said quickly. \"I swear to God I didn't mean to do that! I-it was an accident, I promise. I didn't mean to touch you like that. I was just trying to get a better hold on you and my hand just grabbed on to-to…you know! And I thought you were a guy.\" Danielle's eyebrow twitched. \"You thought I was a guy ?\" Oh crap, did he just make it worse? Danielle cocked her fist back and punched him in the gut. \"Oops, I missed.\" Johnny gasped out, bending over. He shakily held up a thumbs up. \"Yeah, okay. Gotcha.\" Fuck, that huuuurrrt… He was completely glad when class was over and he could retreat. He and the guys left the class in terror, though only he and Bobby had been afflicted with Danielle, even if they all had suffered the silent wrath of their sensei. \"It really wasn't that bad,\" Bobby said in amusement, and the others (Johnny especially) looked at him in disbelief. \"She was nice. The two of us got along at least.\" \"What, really?\" Dutch's jaw dropped. \"I thought she'd hate us!\" \"It hurts still,\" Johnny mumbled, bending over on his bike and letting his forehead rest on the handlebars. \"Poor Johnny,\" Tommy laughed. \"But he is Johnny the Perv!\" Johnny would have throttled him if he could. Instead, he mumbled something unintelligibly and started his motorbike. The others kept laughing at him, even as they started their own bikes, and then they were speeding off. It wasn't long until Johnny split off from them and headed home, to where he stopped his bike before his driveway and got off. He moved his bike to the side and parked it, and then entered his home. \"Hurry, Johnny! We've got guests tonight, so dress up a bit, won't you?\" his mother said urgently. He rolled his eyes, heading for the stairs. \"Sure, Mom. Who's coming?\" \"The Mills,\" his father said, making Johnny winced. \"That means your girlfriend will be here, so make a good impression, son.\" Johnny winced, pausing at the stairs. \"Uh, about that…she's not my girlfriend anymore,\" he muttered. \"She broke up with me a few weeks ago.\" \"Oh, Johnny, are you alright?\" his mother asked sympathetically. He would have milked it and tried to spin it as if it wasn't his fault, but Ali was sure to get to his parents and tell the truth, and then he'd be in hot water. \"I was a bit of a jerk to her,\" he admitted. \"So I'll try to play nice and grovel tonight.\" It would make for good practice for when he had to do the same for Danielle. Easier too, since Ali knew him and her problems with him wasn't as bad. His mother gave him a slight smile and a knowing look. \"Ask your father for tips,\" she said wryly. \"He's had to do plenty of that in the past.\" Johnny choked down a laugh as his father grew flustered. He finished climbing the stairs and went to take a shower. After he got ready, he was quick to get out of his room and head downstairs, when he froze in his tracks as he heard Ali's voice. \"Haha, it's such a funny story, Mrs. Lawrence! But Johnny had been such a pervert that day –\" Johnny rushed down the stairs and skidded to a stop, seeing everyone's eyes on him. Ali was smirking, while his father was staring at him unimpressed and his mother in shock. Ali's parents were surprised and dismayed. \"Do tell, Ali,\" his father said dryly. Johnny mentally groaned. He'd dated her. How could he have forgotten how vindictive Ali could be?! Started 2/9/17 – Completed 2/9/17 A/n: Ah, Johnny…You are so screwed XD I found writing this chapter to be very fun, lol. I hope everyone did too! Please remember to leave a review~[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I blame marathons of Karate Kid movies on TV for making me writing fanfic of it, haha. Story: Working in the restaurant across from the Cobra Kai dojo, Danielle LaRusso's mom decides to sign her up. Being the only female, Danielle has to learn to deal with overprotective Cobra Kai students and a crush on her sensei. Set as a genderbent AU of the first Karate Kid movie. Spoilers: Yeeeessss.

White Crane Chapter Five: Welp…It's a Start? Johnny was sweating. Fuck, why did Ali have to do this to him? \"It's not what you think!\" he rushed to say, but Ali continued on like he'd never said anything. \"See, my friends and I were just hanging around the beach and I met this really cool, sweet and pretty girl that just moved here –her name's Danielle –\" \"Wait, wait,\" he cut in. \"If anyone's telling the story, it can't be you! You'll just twist everything –!\" \"So Danielle was teaching me some soccer stuff, and she's really good at it so I was really impressed, when Johnny and his friends came speeding by on their motorbikes. They parked and started storming down to the beach, where Johnny marched over to me and started harassing me –\" \"That's not true!\" Johnny protested vehemently. \"I just wanted to talk to you.\" \"And I didn't,\" Ali huffed. \"And that ended up with us fighting because you wouldn't just go away. And then you shut off my radio!\" \"You were refusing to listen to me!\" Johnny glared. \"I turned it off so you'd pay attention to me instead!\" \"You held my radio hostage!\" \"I said I'd give it back after we talked!\" \"You ended up breaking it!\" \"Ali, Johnny!\" Johnny's mother actually raised her voice, giving them a stern look. They turned sheepish as they realized their parents were watching them unamused. \"Could you continue on without fighting?\" Ali's dad asked, somewhat sarcastic sounding. Ali took a deep breath. \"While we were fighting, Danielle came over and tried to calm things down. Johnny just snarled at her to not interfere, which ended up pissing her off. Johnny tried to get to me, but Danielle stood in the way and refused to let him. He grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her and then pushed her to the floor, and then he grabbed her breast.\" \"Johnny!\" his mother exclaimed aghast. \"Don't cut corners, Ali!\" Johnny said upset. \"When I was doing that, I was trying to get a better hold on her and grabbed it on accident. And at that time, her beanie came off and I hadn't thought she had any breasts because I thought she was a guy ! After I'd accidently groped her and saw her longer hair, that's when I realized it, okay? I didn't mean to grope her!\" Ali snorted, while Johnny's dad grimaced. \"I don't…think that's any better.\" \"How could you mistake her for a boy?\" Ali couldn't keep her giggles in. \"Oh my God, she's so pretty and exotic, I can't believe you!\" Johnny flushed red, glaring heatedly at his ex-girlfriend, who wouldn't stop laughing at him. \"It is a bit funny, dear,\" his mother reluctantly said. \"Here, I have some pictures of her,\" Ali said excitedly. \"Her friend…that guy named Freddy…he sent me a few texts of pictures of her that they took on their way over. Ah, here!\" Ali showed the grownups the pictures (Johnny tried to get a glimpse, but the others crowded around and he couldn't see passed them). \"I've only got pictures of her with her beanie on,\" Ali said. \"See?\" \"Sorry, Johnny. I really can't see how you could have mistaken her for a boy,\" Ali's father shook his head. \"I thought she was a really pretty boy and I was kind of busy being jealous and thinking 'he' was hitting on Ali to really see,\" Johnny grumbled. \"Well, maybe a very, very, very pretty boy,\" Ali's mother conceded, though even she sounded still a bit skeptical. \"Either way, you are grounded, young man,\" his own mother looked at him sternly. \"And you'll be finding where that young lady lives and apologizing properly, you hear?\" \"Too bad you'll have to wait until school starts to find her,\" Ali smirked at him, probably relishing in his torment. \"She's going to our school by the way.\" \"I don't have to wait until then,\" Johnny frowned. \"Oh? Then how do you expect to find her? You don't know where she lives, who her friends are and where they live, and no other clue than apparently –as Ali said –she's going to be going to your school,\" his father gave him an admonishing look. \"She's a new student in my karate class,\" Johnny grimaced. Ali practically squealed. \"Really? Ohhh, I have to come by so I can say hi to her…\" \"Then did you apologize to her then?\" his mother looked at him expectantly. Johnny was ready to pull out his hair. \"I tried,\" he mumbled. \"I think it was sort of working…up until I admitted I thought she was a guy. Then she proceeded to punch my lights out.\" \"No, no, no!\" Ali laughed out. \"You can't skimp out like that! You have to tell us everything!\" And Johnny thought, hey! Maybe if he'd tell them, they'd feel sorry for him and see he'd already been punished enough. So he did. He told them how Sensei Kreese more or less seemed to know, had periodically punished them through the class, how he'd paired Johnny with her, and how she'd aggressively worked with him in class and he'd let her. Then he mentioned the apology gone wrong and how she'd punched him in the gut. To his utter humiliation, they all started laughing at him. \"I don't know what you expected,\" Ali wasn't holding back on her laughter. \"You thought she really wouldn't take offense to that?\" \"Oh, Johnny, where was your sense?\" his mother shook her head. \"You'll still have to apologize properly to her. In fact, I still want you to find out where she lives, so your mother and I can come with you and give a proper apology for your behavior.\" Johnny's father said sternly. \"Are we clear, Johnny?\" \"Yes, Dad,\" Johnny inwardly sighed. \"Good, so do your best, Johnny.\" He quailed away from his mother's unhappy look. John and Terry were once again at the bar and having a drink. They'd sat down and clinked their glasses, and then John had to face a grinning Terry who was looking at him in impatience. \"So?\" Terry demanded. \"So what?\" John deadpanned. \"Oh come on! Don't be like that, John,\" Terry said, letting a tinge of a whine enter his voice. \"Tell me about the day. Most specifically, how did it go with Danielle? How was she, how was teaching her, what does she look like? Spill!\" John grumbled under his breath and huffed, but did end up talking. \"It wasn't as bad as I'd thought. I taught almost like I normally did, minus all the usual rough treatment, the strike hard stuff, and less yelling. She's got a mean kick and punch, said she'd done some boxing and gymnastics before, and something about cardio kickboxing.\" Terry gave him a weird look at that, but he just shrugged. \"She's a quick teach and really good at catching onto stuff. All in all, the whole teaching her wasn't the big problem I had to deal with today.\" Though, John was still unsure about teaching her and how to deal with her, but he was sure he'd get used to it and/or find some sort of solution. \"Oh, so what was? Didn't you call and tell me about your kids and her already meeting?\" \"Yeah, so this is what happened,\" John began telling Terry a little more in detail of what happened, as was told to him by Danielle, and a little of what he'd overheard from Johnny, who'd been trying to apologize to her and ended up screwing it up. Kid deserved that punch in the gut… \"Huh. Now I'm really curious to know how she looks like,\" Terry said and John fished out his phone. \"I got a pic,\" he said gruffly. \"We were messing around with our phones a little bit in the restaurant.\" Terry leaned over to look before blinking and staring blankly. \"I'm sorry, did you say your student thought she was a guy?\" John nodded. \"Fucking kid's blind.\" John's lip twitched up, while Terry started to chortle. \"My God, she looks nowhere near that. I mean…just no! I don't see it at all. She can't even pass off as a pretty boy, thank you very much. I don't see an inch of androgyny in her either. I don't…what? I'm so confused right now,\" Terry kept shaking his head. \"Yeah, I know,\" John snickered. \"When I heard him say that, I nearly stopped in my tracks and stopped focusing on the class. I almost just stood there and wanted to stare at him incredulously.\" \"She is really pretty though,\" Terry commented slyly, and didn't miss the way his friend's cheeks pinked a bit. \"Totally my type.\" John twitched and socked Terry's shoulder. \"In your dreams, asshole.\" The next day, Johnny was sure he couldn't contain his anxiety. His parents had been giving him looks all morning and the rest of yesterday. That day, he was going to have class with her again and he was going to redo his apology and then ask her for her address. Not that he thought she was going to accept his apology, much less give him her address. Damn it, why couldn't his parents just come to the karate class and apologize with him there?! Maybe it might get her to accept his apology if she saw his parents. But then it would be best for the apology to come at her home, where his parents could be with him? In which case, why couldn't they come to class and get it over with? Ugh. He was going to keep going in circles, if he didn't stop. Wait a sec…Bobby was paired with her too. He'd said that it hadn't been too bad and they'd gotten along. Lunging for his phone, he called Bobby and waited. \"Hello?\" \"Bobby! I need a favor. Can you tell me what you did to get Danielle to not be so angry at you?\" Bobby tutted. \"For one, I didn't actually do much to her in the first place. Also, I approached her first with an apology, before we ever got to practicing anything. Then we started to talk a little, with her a little wary, before we were getting along and talking lightly about stuff and just getting to know each other. I mean, she wasn't spilling her darkest secrets or anything, but I think we could start being friends really soon?\" Johnny mentally whined in his head. Why couldn't it have been so easy for him? \"I need to find out where she lives so my folks and I can go over and apologize,\" Johnny told him. \"I'm not looking forward to class later, since I'm going to try apologizing again by myself, and then trying to get her address so me and my parents can come over.\" \"I know her address,\" Bobby surprised him. \"What? Really? Tell me!\" \"Alright, alright. As long as you're going over there with your parents,\" Bobby laughed. He rattled off an address that Johnny was quick to write down, before he hung up and then went to find his mom and dad to tell them. Once he had, they'd hurried into a car to drive over and Johnny really hoped that this would finally be blown over and he could move on. Soon enough, they'd reached Reseda and then were in front of an apartment building that had probably seen better days. \"Well, isn't this place cozy?\" his mother looked around nervously, tittering quietly to herself. \"Just stick close together. At least it's daytime…\" he heard his father mumble to himself. Johnny sent a quick prayer to whoever was listening. \"Please freaking let this go.\" 'Cause he really hoped Danielle would. He totally didn't want to be known as Johnny the Perv or be called that ever again. When Risa and Travis Lawrence heard what their son did, they were beyond flabbergasted and shocked. The dismay they were in went into subzero levels, and they had even brought up the old idea of sending Johnny off to military school the night Ali had spilled the beans on the incident. However, first and foremost they wanted Johnny to properly apologize to the girl, and they wanted to be there to make sure he did (and didn't mess up again). They also wanted to apologize for the behavior of their son. Still, the neighborhood they were in was a bit sketchy and on the poor side, and as they entered the apartment complex, things didn't look any better. The almost empty pool with its leftover discolored water reiterated that. But they ignored all of that and focused on getting to their destination, prodding Johnny along when it seemed like he was starting to drag his feet and even look reluctant. \"You reap what you sow, son,\" Travis told him seriously. \"You don't get to run from this.\" His son sent him a resentful look that he ignored, and Risa herself gave him a 'leave it' look. Travis didn't get to say or do anything else because they'd finally made it to be in front of the door of where they assumed was where the girl lived. Risa nudged Johnny, who hesitantly knocked. After a moment, it opened and Risa and Travis stood in shock as it did so and showed the girl that their son had insulted and mistook for a boy. Risa had no idea how he could have. The pictures Ali showed didn't give the girl any justice –Danielle LaRusso was very pretty and very feminine. The very idea of mistaking her for a boy was laughable. Travis's own thoughts echoed that, and he felt embarrassed on not only on behalf of his son but for himself and his wife, considering that Johnny sort of represented them, and by his actions and behavior and thoughts, they would look and seem quite the fools. Danielle recognized Johnny and narrowed her eyes at him, but as she looked to them, her expression became more hesitant and unsure. She also seemed to start to look self-conscious, given the large jersey she wore and had tied back, showing off the short shorts she wore and revealing long, lean legs. \"Um, Danielle, these are my parents,\" they distantly heard their son start to say, bringing their attention to the present. More focused, they listened in patiently. \"I'm sorry,\" Johnny rushed to say. \"I really screwed up that day and I know that. My parents also really wanted me to come here and properly apologize, but I also really wanted to apologize for real, without saying something else stupid, because we'll be in karate class together and I just would really like to start over with you.\" Travis took that as his cue and stepped forward, bringing the girl's attention to him. Her sharp attention made him inwardly balk. It was unusual for him to be faced with such intense scrutiny outside of doing business, and it caught him off guard. \"I'm sorry for my son's behavior,\" he started out. \"It was inexcusable and we raised him better than that.\" \"We really do not approve of his actions,\" Risa tacked on. \"And we hoped that he will learn from this and to remember to not be so rash or behave in such a fashion in the future.\" After a beat where they did not know what she would say or do, and half expecting her to shut the door in their faces or yell at Johnny that he was a sexual predator or something, they felt relieved as Danielle gave a sharp nod. \"I accept your apology, Johnny, and you shouldn't have made your parents come all the way here or make them apologize,\" she huffed. \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience and for dragging you into this, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence. The two of you also shouldn't apologize.\" \"It's not inconvenient at all,\" Risa protested. \"And also not your fault,\" Travis added. \"But let's all just put it passed us and move on?\" \"Of course,\" Danielle said agreeably, smiling warmly at him and Risa, and she was infinitely even prettier with her smile. He could feel his cheeks warm and saw Risa's had too. \"Why don't you all come in? I'm making lunch.\" \"Don't mind if we do,\" Risa said cheerfully, already accepting even when they saw that their son was going to refuse. Johnny ended up giving them odd looks. They ignored him. They were just being polite after all. Started 3/6/17 – Completed 3/7/17 A/n: Funny thing, I'm just walking around and then thinking of my crack headcanon of Ali's parents always hitting on Danielle to Ali's embarrassment, and all of a sudden I'm thinking it'd be hilarious jifj all the parents were doing it in here and making the Cobra Kai boys embarrassed as all hell and then I started cracking up in the middle of my hallway. So yeah. Enjoy and review please XD Anon Reviews: 1. Bless You: Thanks! I hope you got another silly grin reading this chapter! 2.

White Crane Chapter Six: Start Anew When Travis and Risa went into the apartment, they were caught off guard by how put together it was. Compared to the outside, the apartment looked homely and cleaned, not looking remotely close to falling apart as the outside would suggest. \"Sorry it's kind of messy,\" Danielle said, hurriedly picking up some books and moving a guitar to the side. \"I haven't finished fixing up and cleaning the place.\" Risa shook her head, smiling blithely while her husband hustled their son to the couch and giving Johnny a 'behave!' look. \"Not at all! Your home is lovely, and well…if we're honest, we didn't expect it after from seeing the outside.\" Risa blushed, more so as Danielle laughed. \"Oh, you should've seen my reaction when I first moved into here with my mom! I wanted to turn right around and go back to Jersey,\" she grinned at them. \"Why did you move out here?\" Johnny asked, and though Risa wished he'd asked in a different tone and more nicely, she was curious too. \"Mom was supposed to have a job out here,\" Danielle wrinkled her nose, rather cutely Travis idly noticed. \"The whole reason for our move was because she'd gotten hired for some kind of computer job here, but when we got here, it turned out they'd filed for bankruptcy sometime after Mom got hired and she was out of a job before she even started. Lucky for her, according to her anyway, the Chinese restaurant across the street –that's across from Sensei Kreese's place –had an opening when some lady rushed out of there, screaming about quitting and everything, and the boss was apparently following and screaming back about how she was fired,\" Danielle couldn't help snickering. \"Mom had her resumé already, it was about to be the lunch hour and lunch rush was coming, so it was pretty much easy for her to get hired.\" \"I don't know whether that's bad luck or good luck,\" Johnny said. Risa almost sighed and just refrained from looking at the ceiling in a 'why us?' manner. However, Danielle didn't seem offended and actually laughed again. She shrugged at them. \"I thought it was bad luck, more so after I met you,\" she looked to Johnny, but she was still grinning, so they all took that to mean (hopefully) that she was no longer holding it against Johnny and was now okay enough to joke about it (again, hopefully). \"Then again, there was the karate dojo Mom found out about and managed to sign me up for, and I've been wanting to take classes since forever, so I guess it makes up for everything else. Plus, Sensei Kreese seems pretty cool.\" \"He is,\" Johnny lit up and began grinning too, excitement shining through a little more obviously. \"He's totally cool. You'll see when you come into class again, and when you've been around for a long time.\" \"Do you go to class regularly?\" Danielle asked him curiously, and Travis and Risa were both glad it seemed that the two were now getting along. \"Y-yeah,\" Johnny actually kind of blushed, getting embarrassed, much to his parents' amusement. \"I guess I'll be seeing you more too then,\" she said, but didn't sound so aggravated about it to their relief. She took out some cooking equipment. \"Do you mind if I continue cooking? I'm boiling pasta, but I have to get started on the sauce.\" \"Oh, right! We interrupted your cooking. We're very sorry,\" Risa started, but Danielle waved her off, smiling sweetly. \"Nah, it's okay. I'm glad you guys came. I managed to forgive Johnny and he got to apologize better. I also got to meet his really awesome and kind parents.\" Risa practically preened while Travis laughed awkwardly and grinned goofily, which had Johnny stare at them weirdly. \"You guys are also amazingly young,\" Danielle noted thoughtfully, beginning to stir the sauce they hadn't noticed that she'd already began working on. Risa legitimately giggled at that, causing Johnny to gape at his mom. \"Nonsense!\" Risa airily waved, feeling herself blush. \"We're in our early thirties, dear.\" Danielle scoffed, lowering the heat on the sauce as the pasta finished and she turned that off. \"Oh please, that's nothing, Mrs. Lawrence. And even better, you still don't look your age!\" If Risa and Travis were feeling supremely giddy, then well…it's been a while since they felt young and fresh, and not exhausted and all worked out. Suddenly, at that moment, they were feeling decades younger and reenergized. They waited while she was finishing draining the pasta in the sink and had transferred it to a large container, before she returned back to the sauce and turned up the heat slightly. \"So your mom's at work, huh?\" Johnny brought up, having decided to ignore his parents. \"Yup,\" Danielle said, popping the 'p'. \"She'll be home late. In the meantime, I'm in charge of this place, so I've sort of slowly been fixing things up and cleaning.\" \"It's great,\" Travis said. \"You seem so responsible, cleaning and maintaining the apartment on your own…and even cooking!\" He was amazed she was so put together. Those her age were usually off doing their own thing, hanging out with friends and not caring about these kinds of things, with their own Johnny being a prime example. \"Ah, well, for the most part it's always just been my mom and me,\" Danielle admitted. \"Except for the last 4 years, where we lived with family, it's been just the two of us, and Mom worked long hours and would work hard for us to live somewhere well enough. I had to learn to try to take care of myself early on, and to help out when I can, and I mostly made the meals since Mom would be too tired to.\" \"Oh,\" Johnny said awkwardly while his parents quieted down. \"Uh, how come you lived with family for the last 4 years?\" \"Mom went to school,\" she said. \"Got a degree. That shiny new degree was supposed to be what got her that job here in LA. 'Course that didn't pan out…Eh, enough about that. How long have you guys lived here?\" And then they were talking about all sorts of things, and lunch followed, to which they were treated to some actually pretty good food. \"Don't tell my family I used packaged pasta,\" she told them sheepishly. \"I was feeling pretty lazy, but they probably wouldn't excuse me from not making homemade pasta on my own.\" \"You make homemade pasta?\" Johnny asked incredulously while his parents laughed lightly. \"We don't even cook ,\" Risa said reassuringly. \"No judgement certainly from here.\" All in all, it was actually a pretty good start to the restart that was totally badly needed for their son. They certainly didn't mind the meeting. After the Lawrence family left, Danielle decided to find Mr. Miyagi. Apparently, he'd stopped by and fixed the water heater like she'd asked, and now the apartment had wonderful, glorious hot water for her to use. Which was great, because she hadn't liked showering with cold water at all. Making her way back to the place where she'd first found him, she saw that he was trimming his bonsai trees. Which made the gift she'd brought along with her perfect as a thank you gift, at least she'd hope so. Knocking quietly on his doorframe so she didn't disturb him, she smiled slightly when she caught his attention. \"Hello, Mr. Miyagi! I just wanted to drop by and thank you for your help, and give this as a thank you gift,\" she smiled wider as she held up the bonsai tree she'd bought for him. He was a kind old man and it seemed he was alone, which was kind of sad to her. He bowed slightly several times. \"Arigato, Danielle-san,\" he surprised her when he remembered her name from her introduction last time they met. \"Come in, come in.\" She went inside and handed him the gift, to which he accepted it and gently set it down. \"Would you like to learn how to trim bonsai tree?\" he asked her, again surprising her. She was kind of intrigued, since she'd learned a little about bonsai trees when she'd looked it up in the process of deciding to buy him one as thanks. She knew it was more of an art, and not just trimming a regular plant or tree, so she came closer in curiosity. \"First, for bonsai tree, you must picture what you'd like to see it as. You could keep it in your mind, or sketch it out if you'd like,\" Mr. Miyagi told her, showing her a drawing pad to the side he had. \"But clear picture, you must have, Danielle-san. After that, you go to bonsai tree to try to copy.\" She blinked, absorbing what he'd said. She tried to visualize something, even though she didn't have too much of a clue and wasn't really creative, and ended up thinking of maybe a traditional one like the ones she usually saw in Japanese art and stuff. Deciding against sketching it this time (she wasn't really an artist anyway), she looked to Mr. Miyagi and nodded. He gave her a small smile and gestured to the bonsai tree she'd given him, handing her a pair of trimmers. Carefully, trying to copy what he showed her on how to hold the trimmers, she watched him trim a branch and tried to copy it as carefully as he did. She put all her attention and focus on it, trying to not mess up and be as close to what she'd pictured in her head. Several times, Mr. Miyagi quietly corrected her on how to hold the trimmers or remind her how to cut the branches and leaves of the bonsai tree, but pretty soon she was getting it. At least the trimming and cutting part, because her vison of how it was supposed to look like wasn't quite what she ended up with. She laughed embarrassedly, but Mr. Miyagi only patted her shoulder. \"Good job, Danielle-san. Come here and practice some more, and you will be as good as Miyagi-san,\" he said. She doubted that, but she did want to practice some more. She wasn't bad at least and she wanted to help him out –plus, it was kind of calming and relaxing. \"Sure, Mr. Miyagi, that sounds great,\" she replied. She looked at the time. \"Ah, I guess I have to be going now. I'll be late for lessons! Thanks again, Mr. Miyagi, and I'll see you around.\" He politely saw her out the door, and then she was hurrying to her bike. After she'd managed to maneuver it out of the area, she got on it and hurried to the dojo. John was arguing on the phone about uniforms. He was actually arguing on the phone about uniforms . Like what the hell? It wasn't a new thing about girls learning karate or anything, so why wasn't there a uniform size for girls for his dojo? \"Your dojo usually has boys, so like the other dojos, we have the sizes pre-made, and for yours we've set up all boy sizes. We haven't made any sizes for girls in your dojo's uniform, so we'll need to custom make the size.\" This is such bullshit . But goddammit, he understood. He'd never had a female student in all the time he'd had the dojo, so there had never been a change in his uniform standards. And now there was a change and it was abrupt, so obviously they had to make adjustments and change that. But that also meant that it was going to freaking take longer than he'd thought to get her uniform, and he wasn't sure how long it was going to take. That meant she had to go on as is for the time being, which also meant that –in a month's time –he wasn't sure if she was going to have a fitted uniform in time for the Vegas showcase he and his dojo were going to for the martial arts exhibition. And the immediate problem he hadn't even gone into yet, was the fact that he had to take her measurements. Which was awkward. He was a male teacher and she was a female student. It didn't get any more awkward than that. \"Goddammit,\" he muttered. It didn't help matters when there was an annoying voice in the back of his head, sounding irritatingly enough like Terry, that was a little too gung ho about this. He put it out of his head, as Danielle came in and put her stuff away, and together they began cleaning up what needed to be cleaned, and then finished setting up as the rest of the class trickled in. To his amusement and curiosity, he noted Danielle greeting Johnny politely (who responded rather nervously) and Bobby a little more enthusiastically. He remembered pairing up Bobby and her yesterday, and it had seemed alright, so he could guess they'd gotten along and she wasn't so irritated by him. But, judging from yesterday, he would have guessed that she'd still be pissed off at Johnny, but it seemed something had happened between that class and this class that caused a change. He was almost willing to be nosy and pry, but didn't. At least, not until class ended and he could ask Danielle about it. He started teaching his class and again he tried to avoid his more harsher methods. He needed to find someone to ask about teaching Danielle, and see if he needed to tone down himself or what. He was in a helluva lot of confusion from this and frankly going nuts. Terry, again, was also a big part of that. Class actually went almost as normal as usual, which surprised him, and he felt a little relieved at the end of it. He was also inwardly chuckling at how the rest of Johnny's posse was like around Danielle, acting like scared animals and ready to run if spooked, and Johnny was partly the same and partly astonishingly trying to talk to her and engage her in interacting. She and Bobby were definitely getting along quite fine, so he had no worries about those two or having the kids work together. Bobby was certainly someone he could count on to help him catch Danielle up. Speaking of… \"Hey, you know, you've barely started and you're doing great,\" he praised her. She grinned at him. \"Awesome! I'm glad I'm not being too much trouble.\" \"Not at all,\" he reassured her. But the measurements…He winced. \"Ah, there is one thing,\" he started nervously. She waited for him, looking at him questioningly. He rushed to tell her the problem, but she looked confused. \"Is there a problem?\" He sighed to himself. \"No, no problem,\" he lied. No need to get her all worked up about it, when he already was. \"So can I get your measurements? Do you know them?\" \"Nah, I don't. If you have a measuring tape here, just measure me,\" she shrugged. His eye twitched, but he said nothing as he went and retrieved the measuring tape. Heading to her, he stared and then looked at the measuring tape. He hesitatingly unraveled it and let one end of the tape go down and held it next to her and then stared. Grumbling to himself, he ended up grabbing the tape and scrunching it together, before he marched Danielle across the street to look for her mother. Confronting Lucille, he shoved her daughter in front of him and held out the messy grouped up tape to her. \"I need your help, Ms. LaRusso. I don't know how to get your daughter's measurements,\" he said, face bright red. And if the ladies laughed at him, well, he wasn't going to say a word about his embarrassment and let them know about it. Started 5/13/17 – Completed 5/16/17 A/n: Oh my god, there's going to be so much funny parent teasing and the boys getting all embarrassed and irritated by them XD And Ali is going to be such a horrible instigator~ I can't wait to write it all XD I hope you guys managed to enjoy this chapter, so please remember to review!

Story: Working in the restaurant across from the Cobra Kai dojo, Danielle LaRusso's mom decides to sign her up. Being the only female, Danielle has to learn to deal with overprotective Cobra Kai students and a crush on her sensei. Set as a genderbent AU of the first Karate Kid movie. Spoilers: Yeeeessss.

White Crane Chapter Seven: Hang With the Boys \"I've survived for two weeks,\" John moaned as he slumped on Terry's couch. Terry chuckled and shook his head. \"That bad?\" \"Well, it wasn't bad per se,\" he winced. \"It's just…I didn't think it'd be so hard to teach her. I mean, I knew I was going to have trouble –I was freaking out from the beginning after all. But shit man, I taught like I was in the military and the boys handled it fine. Not that she can't handle it! She's great, Terry –and hella easy to teach. It's just that I wish I knew a way to teach karate…a little less harsher? So that she'd be a little less uncomfortable when I and the boys get all…\" \"Unmerciful?\" Terry supplied helpfully and John threw a pillow at his head. \"Yeah,\" he shrugged after. \"More or less so she don't get all uncomfortable at the way I teach. I teach like shit if it ain't military and rough, you know that.\" \"Hell yeah,\" Terry agreed. \"You're a fucking bastard.\" A tick developed by John's temple, and he was tempted to drag his friend out to the mansion's pool and toss him into it. Terry started to look at his phone and whistled. \"But damn man, she's gorgeous. When do I get to meet her?\" \"Never,\" John deadpanned. Then he narrowed his eyes. \"What are you looking at?\" he asked suspiciously. \"Nothing,\" Terry sing-songed and John shot up to his feet and rushed him, wrestling the phone away. When he saw what Terry had opened up on his phone, John almost threw it at Terry's head for real before the other man had managed to snatch it away. \"How the hell did you get my picture of her?!\" Terry rolled his eyes. \"Duh. I stole your phone one day and sent it to my phone.\" \"I'm going to kill you!\" Honestly, Danielle didn't exactly expect to be hanging out with the others at Johnny's house. But there she was, in Johnny's huge, extravagant living room with Johnny himself, Bobby, Dutch, Tommy, and Jimmy, and being asked questions and slowly loosening up and warming up to them. \"You guys okay? Danielle, a little more soda?\" Johnny's dad, Travis, came in. \"I'm good, thanks,\" she smiled at him. Travis grinned widely, cheeks pink. \"Okay. Just let me know, alright?\" He left and Dutch poked Johnny. \"What's with your parents? They've been acting all weird, coming in all the time and asking if we need anything.\" \"I don't know,\" Johnny huffed. \"They've been acting weird since they met Danielle.\" She blinked. \"Really?\" \"Yeah!\" he exclaimed. \"They've been super weird! Sorry, guys. I don't know what's up with them. They're being totally embarrassing.\" Tommy poked at the strange looking pasta dish that was there for them to snack on. \"They're trying to cook too. What happened to your cook? They get fired or on vacation or somethin'?\" Johnny huffed, before eying Danielle with a grin. \"They saw her cooking when they met, and they've been trying to cook a little ever since. It's a total mess and the kitchen becomes a disaster.\" Danielle blushed, offering a sheepish grin back. \"Maybe I should offer them cooking lessons?\" \"Please do,\" the blond snorted. \"I don't think I can handle being poisoned again.\" The group burst into laughter at that. \"Hey, you told us about yourself and how it was in Jersey, but you said you haven't really been around LA, right?\" Bobby asked her. She looked at him puzzled. \"No, I haven't really yet.\" \"Awesome! Let's go to the arcade,\" Dutch suggested. \"You said you like to play games, right? There's this huge arcade we go to a lot. Come with us.\" Surprised at the offer, Danielle thought it wouldn't hurt and agreed. She was starting to get along with the boys and sort of be friends. This would be nice to just hang out with them. They got up and cleaned up, and Johnny let his parents know they were going. \"Oh,\" Risa looked disappointed. \"Bye, boys. Bye, Danielle.\" \"Yeah, bye, Danielle,\" Travis echoed. She said goodbye too, only feeling amused as Johnny grabbed her arm and started dragging her away from them, muttering about \"weirdo parents.\" Once again going to ride behind one of the boys on their motorbikes, Dutch eagerly waved her over. \"Ride with me this time, DLo,\" he smirked and she laughed. Still, it was nice that he'd bestowed her with a nickname already. As she settled behind him, she missed him sticking his tongue out at Johnny, who'd been about to ask her if she wanted a ride with him, and Bobby, who'd she'd ridden with to there. The arcade turned out to be really nice and was even larger than she'd thought it be. There were still lots of people there, some a little younger than her, some her age, and some a little older. But there was a lot of different games to play with, and she admitted she was having fun with the others. They stuck together for the most part and went through numerous racing and fighting games. Though when she wanted to do DDR, they all kind of disappeared on her. Danielle laughed to herself and decided that it was probably for the best. They probably didn't have a rhythmic bone in their bodies and were probably going to be all awkward about it. For a while, she played a few rounds by herself before she got tired and decided on a break. She then debated whether to look for the boys or to find something else to amuse herself with, when a trio of college-level guys approached. \"Hey, I'm Rory,\" one of them introduced himself. \"We saw you playing DDR back there. You were really good.\" Shyly, she smiled back at them. \"Thanks. I'm Danielle.\" \"I'm Dean,\" another introduced himself. \"And I'm George,\" the last guy introduced himself. \"What were you thinking of doing next?\" Rory asked, leaning on the game machine next to her. The other two came a bit closer and sort of arranged into a small circle. \"Finding another game or finding my friends,\" she told them. \"Ah, pretty girl like you was left alone?\" George teased. \"I'd hang out with you the whole time if I was your friend,\" he flirted. She blushed horribly, refraining from giggling inanely. Was she being flirted with? She was, wasn't she? It'd been awhile and she was embarrassed to find how awkward she was about it. She used to be able to spot any flirting and either steadfastly be able to ignore it and pretend it wasn't happening, or handle it easily. \"I think they were scared off by a dance game,\" she laughed. They laughed with her before Rory gestured over to the snack bar and winked at her. \"Wanna come with us and get some drinks and snacks?\" Well, that wasn't actually a bad idea…She was getting hungry and thirsty, especially after playing so hard at DDR… She opened her mouth to agree, when she felt a tug backwards and turned to see Jimmy suspiciously looking at the guys, while pulling her behind him. Quickly, she found Bobby and Tommy on either side of her, while Jimmy stood in front of her and then Johnny and Dutch had sort of sidled up to Jimmy's sides. \"Sorry, she's with us,\" Johnny declared. Rory raised an eyebrow. \"Come on, man. We were just going to hang out. We were gonna take care of her.\" Dutch scowled. \"Yeah…no. See you around –not!\" And then she found herself being marched away from them and to, ironically, the snack bar. \"I'm going to get some snacks and drinks,\" Tommy announced huffily. \"I'll get everyone's usual.\" \"But you don't know my usual,\" Danielle blinked, but Tommy was already gone. She shook her head and looked at the rest of the guys, who were obviously not looking at her. She rolled her eyes. \"You boys really didn't need to get all protective,\" her lips were twitching, recognizing that they strangely had gotten all protective over her. Were they really even close enough for them to be like that? \"I was fine with those guys.\" \"They were totally hitting on you,\" Jimmy grumbled. She wondered if she should tell them she knew that. She looked them over and mentally shook her head. Yeah, no. They were probably going to ignore her about it anyway, and stick to their protective behavior. Tommy came over with some food and drinks, before yanking Dutch to come with him to get the rest. She was amused to find that she'd gotten a plate that was piled with a little of everything for her to try. Well, saves going up there and deciding what she wanted. Later on, she had exited the bathroom and was going to head to the front of the arcade where she was going to meet with the others, when she ran into the three young men from earlier. \"Hey, you!\" George greeted, grinning. \"Glad to run into you.\" \"Where are you off to now?\" Rory asked. \"Heading home,\" she told them regretfully. \"I'm just heading up to the front to meet my friends.\" \"Yeah? Why don't you just hang around here with us instead?\" Dean said, placing an arm around her and drawing her close. She straightened up and started to feel uncomfortable. \"I really do have to get home though,\" she shifted uneasily, trying to move away from Dean, but his arm tightened around her. \"It's getting late,\" she tried to explain. \"No worries,\" George said slickly. \"We can get you home. Just hang out for a bit.\" They were being a lot more persistent and she was starting to feel alarmed. \"Maybe…maybe some other time?\" Danielle suggested, wanting to yank the arm around her off of her and then run. She was starting to feel defensive and debated whether she should use what little karate she knew so far, to get out of this situation she found herself in. She didn't want to resort to violence already after all. Before she could even come to a decision though, she felt first before she saw Dean being harshly pushed from her, and saw Johnny furiously standing there, glaring at the older males. \"Get off her!\" he shouted at them. The others joined in, lining up with Johnny and closing ranks around her as they postured aggressively and glared together at the taller guys. \"You want to really go up against us?\" Rory asked coolly, taking a step towards them. \"Try it,\" Bobby, normally the least aggressive of the boys, actually snarled at the other. \"We've got black belt karate training that'll put you down easily,\" he threatened, which made Danielle look at him in surprise. That put the older guys on guard and a little wary. \"Tch, whatever,\" George sneered. \"Fuck off, you little punks.\" Then he looked at Danielle and smirked. \"See you around, Danielle.\" The other two said something similar and then they were gone. \"Jerks,\" Dutch grumbled. \"Let's get out of here.\" \"What're we doing next?\" Bobby asked, back to being perky and smiling cheerily. It totally messed with Danielle's head, since she'd just seen the normally sweet one of the group act so hostile. \"Let's check out the movies and see what's playing,\" Jimmy said and the others chorused their agreement, while Danielle just stood there, slightly gaping. She was caught between being utterly amused and bewildered at this group of boys she'd managed to get stuck with. Started 8/23/17 – Completed 8/23/17 A/n: Heh, so they're starting to get along finally! Maybe? Lol, at least they're already protective (Danielle's amused and confused for now, but her slight exasperation is probably going to be full blown exasperation soon enough XD) Next chapter –Ali and her parents! After that, Ali's parents versus Johnny's (and the introductions of the others?!). Hurr hurr, so much fun. Hope you guys liked and were amused at this chapter. Please remember to review! They are what keeps me going to for this site. Anon Reviews: 1. Dark Yugi: Thanks! As for OCs, I'm not really looking for a particular one. If someone asks me about an OC and submits one and I end up liking it, then I'll try to slip them in somewhere (or at the least, even if I don't like it, I'll try to slip the OC in for at least a cameo or something). And it could be for any fandom; if you want it for a HP story (which one?) then that's fine too.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I blame marathons of Karate Kid movies on TV for making me writing fanfic of it, haha.

But she'd let that jerk already have his time and now she wanted to see her again! She was still angry at him for last time, so he was lucky she even agreed to his request in the first place. Personally, after the hell Johnny caused both her and Danielle (and more so back when they'd been dating and he'd been such a possessive, jealous asshole the whole time), she should've just let him continue to face Danielle's wrath and laugh at his misfortune. Then again, as she heard it, it sounded like Danielle had forgiven him semi-quickly. But if you asked her, it was probably more to the fact that Johnny had dragged his parents with him to apologize. Ali debated whether or not to enter the dojo or wait outside for Danielle, but the choice was taken from her as Danielle exited out right then. \"Oh!\" Danielle exclaimed in surprise at the sight of her. \"Ali! Long time no see. How are you?\" The blonde beamed at the other, especially since Danielle had remembered her. \"Good! I was actually dropping by here, hoping I'd run into you. You want to go grab some milkshakes?\" Danielle blinked but then grinned. \"Sure, sounds good to me. Lead the way.\" Ali was ecstatic and grabbed Danielle's hand, mindful of not going too fast since the brunette had a bag that looked heavy. At around a corner, there was a diner that she went into and found one of the smaller booths to sit in. \"I'm really glad to have run into you again,\" Danielle said, making Ali inwardly crow in delight at the admission. \"Last time we met ended up really horribly and I wish things hadn't ended up the way it did. Before that, we were starting to have a really good time and I thought I was making friends with you.\" \"You were,\" Ali said quickly. \"And I thought the same. I really enjoyed hanging out with you and was having fun.\" Danielle looked happy and relieved. \"You have no idea how awesome that is –you're actually my first female friend. Back in Jersey, for some reason I just couldn't make friends with any of the girls my age.\" \"Really?\" Ali asked in shock. \"I can't believe that!\" She really couldn't. Danielle had seemed so cool and that was just from what Ali had seen from their first meeting. Her other friends were just so girlish and too prim sometimes, but Danielle had been laidback and even a bit boyish, even while still being able to be feminine. Something Ali wished she could do and be able to balance that out. She wanted to play soccer, do something like karate, or whatever else mostly boys do, and yet still be girly. Danielle was so pretty, Ali thought while they chatted on. She had such a pretty face and soft looking lips. She was so slender, but she looked strong too, like she really could have outfought Johnny on the beach that day (which technically she did). And her hair looked so soft…Ali's fingers twitched and she had the urge to play with Danielle's hair. She wondered if she'd let her style it later on? Or makeup. She'd like to put makeup on her. Ah geez, Ali sounded so weird. Good thing this was all stuff in her head. Imagine if she'd just blurted out all of this to anyone, much less Danielle! She inwardly huffed. It was her own private thoughts and she could think whatever. Hmph. Still, it was nice to have a friend that wasn't so judgmental or so fixated on girlish things all the time. She loved Susan and Barbara, and she didn't mind talking about boys, gossiping, or doing makeup and hairstyling, but sometimes she just wanted to yank her hair out and scream out in frustration and boredom. Danielle was like a breath of fresh air. \"So we'll meet here tomorrow and I'll take you to my house?\" Ali asked, finalizing their plans for tomorrow. \"I can't wait,\" Danielle said, and her excitement was more than shared by Ali. Sometimes, just sometimes, Ali felt so caged and alone. Somehow she didn't feel like that right now. After Danielle left her, heading to the Chinese restaurant from across the street to the dojo, Ali waited for her ride. It wasn't long until her chauffeur came and picked her up, driving her back to her home where she practically skipped inside. \"Ali?\" her mother asked in amusement. \"Something put you in a good mood?\" \"I get to hang out with Danielle tomorrow,\" Ali smiled widely at her mother, with her father coming into the kitchen at that time. \"Danielle?\" her father asked and Ali reminded him of who she was talking about. \"You know, the one Johnny the Perv groped that time,\" Ali said nonchalantly, and her father stifled a laugh as her mother sighed. \"Sweetie, you need to stop calling Johnny that,\" her mother told her disapprovingly. \"If not for him, then for Travis and Risa. Feel a little bit sorry for them, won't you? Their son earning a reputation and that nickname isn't going to be easy on them.\" Ali rolled her eyes. \"Yes, Mom.\" \"So this Danielle,\" her father hesitantly started. \"We don't know much about her. She's Italian, you said?\" \"Mmhm,\" Ali said. \"Lived in Jersey all her life though, so she wasn't born in Italy. She's got an Italian accent though.\" It was dreamy. Ali wished she had an accent. \"Don't know if she's ever been to Italy though.\" \"She lives in Reseda now though, right?\" her mother asked, frowning a bit. Ali frowned herself. \"Yeah, so?\" \"It's nothing, Ali,\" her father quickly interceded. \"Just confirming things you told us.\" She watched them suspiciously but shrugged it off. It didn't seem like it was too important, so she decided to forget about it. Arthur and Quinn Mills weren't judgmental. Really. Or they try not to be. And they worry a lot, especially when it came to their daughter. All in all, though they were on her side when it came to the whole Johnny situation, they just didn't know this Danielle LaRusso. She was foreign apparently, even if she was born and had lived in the United States all her life. She was still a touch European, and the two of them have no idea if that would mean she'd have some quirks. She also lived in Reseda and everyone knows that was more in the poorer parts of Los Angeles. They were wealthy and weren't used to mingling with those that…wasn't. It sounded harsher than it really was. Really, it did! \"Art, I'm being reasonable, right?' Quinn muttered to her husband as they waited at home, while their daughter had gone to pick up Danielle. \"You are,\" he reassured her. \"We're just being cautious. Nothing wrong with that.\" And they were just being cautious. It had nothing to do with being judgmental. That's why, when they heard Ali chattering excitedly through the front door, they gave a look to each other and stood up to greet Ali's new friend. They could be polite. They'd give Danielle a chance – \"Oh,\" Arthur heard his wife say softly. He felt like his mouth was too dry to utter anything. He was probably dehydrated or something… Ali's pictures before really didn't do Danielle justice though. Without the beanie and being up close and personal, Danielle was even prettier than he'd thought. Not that he thought she was pretty! Well he did, but it was just on a factual note. \"Mom! Dad!\" he heard Ali happily greet them. \"This is Danielle. Danielle, these are my mom and dad.\" \"Nice to meet you,\" Danielle greeted exuberantly, coming over and kissing both of his cheeks. Yes, right, European . He quite liked this quirk. Arthur gave an awkward smile to her. \"N-nice to meet you as well.\" He glanced at his wife, who looked at him and at Danielle. But she looked awkward as well, so he had no idea what was running through her head. \"So is it okay that Danielle and I hang around here? We'll probably be hanging out a lot here, if you guys don't mind,\" Ali prodded them. \"Ah, yes,\" Quinn said after a pause. \"Of course! Have fun, you two. Danielle, feel welcome here and make yourself at home.\" Danielle blinked before a wide grin spread across her face. She broke out in scattered Italian and English, expressing her gratitude and whatever else she was saying. Honestly, Arthur was too busy turning into a pile of goo apparently. Ali was beyond ecstatic. Having asked her, Danielle had been hanging around Ali's home a lot for the past week. She was having so much fun and was getting along so well with the brunette, that she didn't care how weird her parents were being. Whenever Danielle was around, they'd turn all awkward and stuff. It was weird, but she knew they'd already been hesitant about Danielle because she was Italian and kind of poor. She just wished they weren't so obvious about how they felt about Danielle. Right now was lunch though, and Danielle had offered to cook something. Ali was in bliss. She couldn't wait to tease and taunt Johnny about this. \"Are you cooking, Danielle?\" her mother entered the kitchen with her father, and Ali looked at them cautiously, hoping they wouldn't make a scene. Quinn turned flustered. \"Y-you really don't have to! Oh Ali, she's a guest. Don't make her cook!\" Ali gave her a strange look. \"It's alright, Mrs. Mills,\" Danielle said. \"I offered to cook for us. Are you hungry? I could make enough for all of us.\" Then Ali saw both of her parents become all flustered. \"You're not our w-wife, Danielle,\" Arthur blurted out. \"You don't have to take care of us. And you can call us just Arthur and Quinn, you know!\" Wife? Why in the hell did her dad choose that analogy? Danielle blinked slowly, tilting her head. She smiled hesitantly. \"It's okay, really.\" \"Though she would make a good wife,\" her mother tacked on absentmindedly. Ali nearly choked on her soda, watching her parents with wide eyes. Were they flirting with her friend? \"Are you flirting with Danielle?!\" she tried not to screech. Her father sputtered. \"What? No! Of course not!\" But then her mother's muttered \"Were we?\" to him kind of ruined that. Oh my God, this was so embarrassing. She couldn't believe they were flirting with her friend, even if they hadn't meant to. No wonder they'd been acting weird all this time! But Danielle only laughed (was that a good or bad thing?) and shook her head. \"It's cool, Ali. I don't mind. I think it's actually kind of sweet. Plus, it's flattering from such a good-looking couple,\" Danielle winked at them, both of whom blushed a bit. Ali gaped before becoming exasperated and hitting Danielle's arm. \"Don't encourage them!\" But as it was, what Danielle said seemed to have perked them up and given Ali's parents confidence and even incentive to keep doing so (consciously now), more so when Danielle playfully reciprocated their flirting. It was still really really strange, but Ali kind of got used to it as it gradually just became a thing with them. \"Ali?\" Arthur poked his head into her room. \"Are you busy?\" \"Nope,\" she answered, still painting her nails. \"Um, have you talked with Danielle today?\" which made Ali giggle. She glanced slyly at him and Arthur nearly backtracked out of his daughter's room. \"Why? Want to talk to her? Ask her out to dinner?\" she teased and Arthur felt his face heat up. \"Ali!\" she laughed at him and he just scowled. \"I was just asking because there's that social party coming up soon and I was wondering if you'd invite her to it.\" \"Oh, that,\" Ali gave him a surprised look. \"I didn't think about that or inviting her. It's not really her social circle and I know how you and Mom are about those things.\" Arthur coughed and shifted a bit. \"Well…Danielle can come. Your Mother and I would like her to come,\" he said a little more firmly at the end. Ali smirked at him, making him uncomfortable. \"Invite her then.\" \"What?\" he stared at his daughter. \"In. Vite. Her,\" she drew out and grabbed her phone, throwing it at him. \"Here's her number.\" He fumbled to catch it and stared at his daughter again, this time like a deer in headlights. \"Well?\" she raised an eyebrow at him. He cleared his throat and glared at her. \"Fine.\" But he left there, intending to call away from his daughter. She'd just make fun of him again if he'd stayed. Looking up Danielle's number, he remembered his own phone was left on the kitchen island, and he went there to find his wife humming as she fixed a bouquet. \"How'd it go?\" Quinn asked him. \"Did Ali ask?\" Arthur huffed. \"Our daughter's being difficult as always,\" he grumbled, grabbing his phone and typing in Danielle's number quickly. He bit his lip but ended up saving it. After pressing call, he waved it at his wife. \"She's making me ask her.\" Quinn snorted. \"Of course she is. Ali can be so trying.\" Arthur couldn't answer then, seeing as he heard Danielle pick up. \"Hello?\" He took a deep breath before looking at Quinn, who gave him an encouraging look. \"Uh, Danielle. This is Arthur? We were wondering if you were free this weekend. There's a party coming up and…\" Well, maybe it wasn't so bad inviting her himself. Started 3/26/18 – Completed 3/30/18 A/n: This was extremely entertaining for me to write. The next chapter will be even more so XD You know…Risa and Travis versus Arthur and Quinn after all. Lol. Hope you guys enjoyed this and please remember to review~[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I blame marathons of Karate Kid movies on TV for making me writing fanfic of it, haha. Story: Working in the restaurant across from the Cobra Kai dojo, Danielle LaRusso's mom decides to sign her up. Being the only female, Danielle has to learn to deal with overprotective Cobra Kai students and a crush on her sensei. Set as a genderbent AU of the first Karate Kid movie. Spoilers: Yeeeessss. Yes, yes, yes. Beware? Warnings: Age difference, excessive drinking, some violence and language, PTSD, gender roles and gender expectations, societal expectations… Pairings: John Kreese/fem!Daniel, maybe Terry Silver/fem!Daniel, one-sided Cobra Kai/fem!Daniel. White Crane Chapter Nine: Green Fire Burns Hot Travis and Risa had arrived early to the party, dragging their unwilling son with them. While not always enthused with attending these kinds of social gatherings, Travis and Risa had always made sure to attend and not look like snobs. Goodness knows what their absence would look like to others or what rumors would be spread (worse is if people just started saying things about them behind their backs and those were spread). \"Do I have to be here?\" Johnny whined. \"Yes,\" Travis answered without looking at his son. \"This is stupid,\" Johnny started muttering. \"It's boring and I'd rather hang with the others.\" \"Lucky for you that your friends and their parents will be here as well,\" Risa said wryly. \"DLo won't,\" Johnny grumbled. \"DLo?\" Risa asked, not familiar with the nickname. \"Who's that –\" \"Wait a second, she is here!\" Johnny straightened up with a grin. Then he made a face. \"What's she doing with Ali ?\" Both Travis and Risa looked over to where their son was looking at and realized that A) DLo apparently had to have meant Danielle, and B) Danielle was there at the party and looked very pretty in her peach-colored skater dress. They hadn't known she was coming. They didn't think she'd want to come to those type of parties, or that it was necessarily her social crowd and that she wouldn't or want to fit in. In hindsight, they felt very stupid and disappointed that they hadn't tried to invite her to it themselves, even if they thought she'd decline. But…this wasn't – \"This ain't her crowd,\" Johnny said in confusion. \"What would she be doing here anyway? It's a boring rich people only party.\" While crudely said, their son was right. This was a well-to-do community and everyone attending were well off and more likely than not owned a successful business or two. Why was Danielle there? \"Oh! Travis, Risa!\" Arthur and Quinn spotted them and came over, Ali and Danielle automatically following them. The four of them exchanged greetings before Travis locked eyes with Danielle and was met with a lovely smile. Ah, damn it. He tried not to freeze up, forcing his own lips to smile back. Honestly, he wanted to hide behind Risa right then. \"Nice seeing you again, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence,\" she told them. \"It's our pleasure!\" Risa said, which he was grateful for since he didn't think he could speak right then. \"Whatcha doing here, DLo?\" Johnny cut in, grinning in a laid-back manner. \"Arthur and Quinn invited me,\" she said easily, grinning back before turning that grin on Ali's parents. Arthur? Quinn? Travis really did freeze up then, turning his gaze on Arthur and Quinn, who looked very pleased with themselves. He could feel Risa stiffening up beside him. \"Well, we really would have liked to have had you here with us,\" Quinn said happily. Ali snickered, glancing at her father. \"Oh yeah. I can't tell you, Danielle, just how eager and happy Dad was to personally invite you.\" Arthur's face turned red. \"Ali!\" Travis felt his jaw beginning to drop. What on earth…? Danielle laughed. \"Oh geez, Arthur!\" She winked at him. \"If you wanted it to be really personal, you could've come over to my place and knocked on my door.\" Wait, what?! Arthur coughed, even as his wife and daughter laughed at him. \"Yes, well…\" He actually began to smirk. \"I like to play it cool and be a little hard to get myself. Don't want to be too eager.\" Was he…was he flirting with Danielle?! \"Ew,\" Ali huffed. \"Geez, still weird that my parents flirt with you, Danielle. If you ever start feeling weirded out, like you're supposed to, just tell me and I'll put those perverts straight.\" Danielle was laughing again, even as Arthur and Quinn sputtered and glared at their daughter. \"You're so grounded, missy,\" Quinn scowled at her daughter, while Ali just gave her a thumbs up. What the hell? They really were flirting with Danielle? Travis was having a hard time comprehending that. He felt a scowl itch at his lips and he tried not to show just how unhappy he was feeling right then. \"Danielle hangs around so much, and it's like they're trying to make her a sister-wife or something,\" Ali continued to tease her parents. \"Quit hogging her! She's supposed to be there to hang out with me,\" Ali grinned in amusement. \"You're so not getting out of the house until you're 30.\" \"Haha, you guys are so lucky I managed to snag Danielle and become friends with her! Plus, the whole pestering her to come over all the time –how else are you two going to suffer with your cute crushes? And you're lucky I did, because you wouldn't have met her if I hadn't,\" she kept up with her merciless teasing. \"I don't know. Maybe I'm the lucky one,\" Danielle interjected. She winked again at Arthur and Quinn. \"Two good-looking people interested in me? Wow.\" Travis was not jealous. He really wasn't. (Goddammit, what the hell had happened and how did those two get so close to Danielle? Close enough to be flirting with her! Not fair!) Travis made his expression blank, relieved when Ali dragged Danielle off to get some snacks to bring back with them. Johnny was about to follow when he saw his wife's hand shoot out and grab their son's collar. \"Johnny dearest, I thought you were closer to Danielle now?\" Risa asked, tone deceivingly calm. Johnny blinked at them. \"Yeah. I am.\" \"Then maybe you should invite her over more,\" Travis said tersely, feeling irritable now for some reason. \"And become closer friends with her,\" Risa tacked on, smiling (and yet it felt menacing; his wife could be so scary). \"Er…okay?\" \"Now you two, don't be so hard on him,\" Arthur said with a laugh. \"He and Danielle got off to a bad start after all! At least now the two of them have finally become friends and are getting along great, right Johnny?\" \"Yeah,\" Johnny said slowly. \"DLo has been hanging around us a lot and just last week we went to an arcade.\" He made a face then. \"Some older college jerks were hitting on her though.\" Well, that made the four adults suddenly scowl in unison. Danielle and Ali rejoined them then, but so had Johnny's friends and their parents. Travis didn't turn to them, still busy eying Arthur and Quinn, who had noticed the firm attention of him and Risa (who also hadn't greeted the others, too busy outright glaring at the other two). \"Problem, Risa?\" Quinn said 'sweetly'. \"Not at all,\" Risa said a bit haughtily. \"I'm not too old to know better, is all.\" Quinn's nostrils flared in anger and Travis kind of felt that was a low blow himself. It's not like he and Risa were that younger than Quinn and Arthur. \"You guys are ridiculous though,\" Travis shrugged, faking nonchalance. Just because he thought it was a low blow didn't mean he didn't approve of it and that he wouldn't support his wife. And he was so not going to lose out to them over Danielle. \"What's going on?\" Bobby asked and Ali tried to stifle her snort. \"I think my parents are fighting with Ali's parents over Danielle,\" Johnny said with a grimace. Danielle choked on her drink, the Shirley Temple going down the wrong throat. Dutch burst out laughing. \"No shit, really?\" \"Language,\" his dad reprimanded, looking confused. He glanced at his son and then glanced at the girl in question. He smirked and stepped closer to her, running a hand through his slicked back hair. \"Hello, you must be Danielle,\" he said smoothly. Well, she was pretty and he couldn't have Arthur, Quinn, Risa and Travis have all the fun. Dutch eyed his dad weirdly. No way –not his dad too! Th rest of the boys in the group glanced at them, ignoring Ali who had taken a step away from the group and was doing her best to control her laughter. \"Hi, I'm Lukas Kirkland. I hear you and Frederick have become good friends,\" he smiled winsomely at her. \"Frederick?\" \"Dad!\" Dutch turned red in the face. \"It's Dutch !\" His father didn't even blink, still smiling at Danielle who had smiled hesitantly back at him. \"I'm Danielle LaRusso,\" she introduced herself. \"Your son likes to call me DLo. Please to meet you, sir.\" \"None of that!\" he waved her off. \"If you call Arthur and Quinn by their names, call me Lukas! Alright, Danielle?\" \"Ah…okay?\" All of a sudden, Bobby's dad cut in. \"Same here, Danielle. I'm Bobby's dad,\" he smiled widely at her as well. \"Call me Heath,\" he said as he pushed his glasses up. \"I'm so glad Grans isn't here,\" Tommy muttered under his breath, watching incredulously at the others. \"I'm glad my sister isn't here,\" Jimmy grimaced. \"I don't know if I should bail her out or not,\" Ali held back a snort. \"I don't know if I even can .\" Bobby exasperatedly tugged his father away, but Heath just distractedly pushed his hands away as he started to question Danielle about her life before moving there, with Lukas interjecting and trying to cut in every way he can. \"This is so embarrassing!\" Dutch complained. Johnny made a face. \"You have no idea. I can't believe that's what my parents have been doing all this time! No wonder they've been acting all weird and stuff when she's around.\" \"Hey, you just figured it out now,\" Ali pointed out. \"I've been suffering this since I introduced her to my parents –like a week later I figured out that they were flirting with her and that's why they were being like that.\" \"Yeah, well, why would I have figured it out earlier?\" Johnny muttered. \"Who thinks their parents are flirting with their friend? That's freaking weird .\" \"She's got that 'help me, guys!' look on her face,\" Jimmy pointed. \"I think Dutch and Bobby already have a handful trying to calm their dads down,\" Ali shrugged. \"I don't think we'd be much use.\" \"Ah well,\" Tommy shrugged. \"DLo would make a great wife.\" He got strange looks at that, but no one refuted his statement. \"Oh my God , Mr. Miyagi! It was really crazy earlier. You know how I was invited to that super uppity socialite party that I told you about?\" Danielle asked while she clipped at the bonsai tree. \"Hai, Danielle-san. I remember,\" Mr. Miyagi said in amusement. \"Yeah, well, I told you about Arthur and Quinn, right? Apparently, Travis and Risa –Johnny's parents and who insisted I call them by their first names too –well, they've been 'flirting' with me too, and they were sort of fighting each other over me earlier. And then, while they were distracted with that, I met Bobby and Dutch's dads and who sort of started flirting with me too. I told you, crazy right?\" \"Do you want Miyagi-san to grab katana? Miyagi-san can make sure they will not bother Danielle-san anymore,\" Mr. Miyagi offered jokingly. That made Danielle laugh. \"Nah, it's okay, Mr. Miyagi. I don't actually really mind,\" Danielle smiled to herself, shaking her head. \"It's kind of nice and sweet in a strange way.\" \"Very well. Just tell Miyagi-san when Danielle-san needs help. Miyagi-san very good with karate and always keeps katana sharp,\" he told her. She giggled at that, though her interest had been piqued. \"Hey, Mr. Miyagi? How long have you been practicing karate for?\" Started 5/9/18 – Completed 5/12/18 A/n: Welp, this would have been done way sooner, except real life has a way of ruining plans, huh? Hope you guys were as amused at reading this as I was writing it XD Please remember to review! I really appreciate being able to hear back from everyone (especially since I'm amazed and delighted at how much everyone is enjoying the adults, lol). Quick Points: 1. First Arc : Actually almost done. Then we'll be picking up on the next arc, which is the main bulk of the first movie. 2. Cobra Kai TV series : Anyone see it yet? I actually really like it and enjoyed it! Can't wait until the second season. Speaking of it though… 3. Travis and Risa : Are definitely not canon XD Johnny's mom is actually named Laura (I think I remember), he has a rich stepdad, so Johnny's background in my head is totally different than the new canon. Oops? 3. The Parents : That said, I'm just curious as to which actor/actress you guys see of our cast of parents/adults? Usually, I come up with cast, but I'm feeling lazy and I am rather curious to everyone's opinions… Anon Reviews: 1. Guest 1: Haha, it was fun to have the parents fighting over Danielle! It was just so funny and I kept cracking up while writing. I love making them so flustered whenever Danielle's around XD 2. Guest 2: You're welcome and thank you! 3. Dark Yugi: Hey! I'm good, thanks. You? Thanks a lot and congrats on getting your own account. Sure (like I said, if I can fit them in~) and sure again (if you'd like) :D 4. Guest 3: Hehe, thank you~ ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I blame marathons of Karate Kid movies on TV for making me writing fanfic of it, haha. "},{"Movie":"Hansel & Gretel","Title":"Sang-Mêlé","Author":"Anime no Akuma","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10879757","Passage":"[Chapter 1] POV Hansel : Je m'appelle Hansel. Pour faire court, moi et mon frère jumeau chassons des sorcières depuis notre plus jeune âge. Oui, oui, des sorcières ! Croyez le ou non, c'est votre choix, ce n'est pas mon problème. Enfin, nous les chassons depuis plusieurs années maintenant et nous nous trouvons désormais à Augsbourg (à la demande du maire de la ville) car une importante activité de sorcières a été remarquée. Il y a eu énormément d'enlèvements d'enfants sur le bord des routes et même en ville, ce qui est très inhabituel et imprudent de la part de ces monstres. - Mon nom est Gretel, et voici mon frère, Hansel. Nous sommes des chasseurs de sorcières. La voix de mon frère me tira de mes pensées, me ramenant à la réalité, et je me mis au travail, inspectant la femme que tous suspectaient être une sorcière, ce qui était absurde, croyez-le bien. - Lorsqu'une personne pratique la sorcellerie, les stigmates sont très visibles sur les dents, les cheveux et le visage en entier, même. Il est donc impossible pour une sorcière de se cacher, voilà aussi pourquoi elles ne vivent pas en ville comme n'importe qui, puisque leur laideur est très facilement remarquable, expliquais-je. Cette femme n'est pas une sorcière. - Votre explication est tout à fait exacte, sauf pour certains points : Les sorcières peuvent se dissimuler en ville en modifiant leur apparence, du moins, les plus puissantes, et cette femme fait partie des rares qui sont capable de cet exploit, intervint alors une voix dans l'assemblée. Je me retournais, et la foule se fendit en deux, laissant passer deux personnes encapuchonnées. La première baissa sa capuche, laissant découvrir un visage au teint légèrement doré, aux yeux bruns chocolat et aux cheveux de la même couleur. Une cicatrice lui fendait la joue gauche, et sa lèvre était légèrement fendue dans le bas. C'était la seconde, le visage toujours dissimulé, qui avait parlé. - Tu ne sais pas de quoi tu parles, affirma mon frère en s'approchant de moi, tout en fixant la fille qui m'avait contredit. Celle qui s'était dévoilée monta en coup de vent sur l'estrade et, avant que nous n'ayons pu faire quoi que ce soit, elle sortit une dague de sa manche, assez longue et à la pointe recourbée vers l'arrière, et elle décapita d'un coup la femme que nous venions de sauver. La tête roula jusqu'aux pieds de l'autre fille, debout devant nous, et qui n'avait toujours pas montré son visage, et le sang gicla avec force, nous arrosant moi, mon frère, les deux filles et le Shérif, qui ferma les yeux d'un air dégouté. Pourtant, alors que nous allions sortir nos propres armes pour menacer l'assassin qui venait d'éliminer une jeune femme innocente, la seconde personne souleva la tête à la vue de tous, alors que celle-ci changeait lentement d'apparence. Quand la transformation s'eut terminée, deux cornes torsadées sortaient du front, une langue fourchue pendait de la bouche ouverte et des canines jaunes et pointues étaient apparentes. Le teint était verdâtre et parcouru de petites écailles luisantes, et les cheveux étaient devenus noirs avec des mèches blanches. Une véritable sorcière dans toute sa laideur, en somme. - Ceci était sa véritable apparence, clama alors la deuxième fille (non découverte). Elle prit un briquet, mit feu au bucher qui avait été préparé, et jeta la tête dedans. - Ali, j'ai sa baguette ! s'écria alors la première fille. Celle-ci tenait une baguette en bois tordue avec une pierre au centre. Elle la lança à la dénommée Ali, qui l'attrapa au vol et se mit à l'examiner de plus près. - Éli, écoute ça ! s'exclama-t-elle alors. Bois de chêne mort, très flexible, saphir de taille moyenne. Ça te dit quelque chose ? - Probablement une Océlique, encore une fois, proposa la dénommée Éli. - Non, elle n'aurait pas pu changer son apparence à ce point ! Mais c'est vrai que les écailles portent à confusion. Marinique serait plus approprié, non ? - Tu as sûrement raison, comme d'habitude. Mais que fait-elle aussi loin de la mer, dans ce cas ? - Aucune idée, elle devait ingurgiter de l'eau de mer assez souvent, par contre, sinon elle n'aurait pas survécu. En tout cas, c'était une belle prise. - Quoiqu'on n'ait pas tout fait le travail, pour une fois, répondit ladite Éli en souriant légèrement. - Je le savais que c'était une sorcière, j'avais raison ! Je suis un sauveur ! s'écria soudain le Sheriff. Les deux filles semblèrent reprendre conscience du fait qu'elles n'étaient pas seules, et se tournèrent d'un bloc vers l'imbécile. La dénommée Ali s'avança alors d'un pas raide vers lui. - Ce n'était que de la chance. Il n'y avait qu'une sorcière à être capable de changer d'apparence dans cette ville, et toutes les autres femmes que vous avez condamnées, à moins de correspondre à la description expliquée plus tôt, étaient innocentes ! Alors vous n'êtes pas un sauveur, mais bien un assassin ! siffla-t-elle. - Et qui nous dit que vous n'êtes pas l'une d'entre elles ? cracha le Shérif. - Éliane, tu crois que c'est une bonne idée ? demanda Ali. Oh, tiens, elle s'appelle Éliane ? Ah, bien sûr, « Éli » est le diminutif. - Et bien, il 'y plus de sorcières dans cette ville alors j'imagine qu'il n'y a aucun risque, répondit Éliane en haussant les épaules. Des risques ? Mais quels risques ? L'autre fille, Ali, baissa alors sa capuche. Ses cheveux blonds étaient raides et plutôt longs, en plus d'une mèche noire sur le côté de sa tête. Ses yeux en amande, d'un verts étincelant, nous fixaient sans expression apparente, et sa peau halée ne faisait que ressortir d'avantage la cicatrice qui lui barrait l'œil droit, ainsi que les deux plus petites sur la paupière gauche, juste à la limite de l'œil. - Bon ben, c'est pas qu'on s'ennuie, mais on a autre chose à faire alors à plus ! s'exclama soudain la blonde en descendant de l'estrade. Son amie la rejoignit, et Éliane remit sa capuche sur sa tête. Pourtant, alors que son amie allait l'imiter, elle se stoppa et se tourna vers nous, ou plutôt vers le maire. - Si jamais nous trouvons une quelconque information concernant vos enfants, nous viendrons vous en informer, mais nous ne mènerons aucune enquête. Notre travail, c'est traquer et tuer, pas de mener des recherches à propos d'enfants kidnappés. Et, sur ces aimables paroles, elle mit sa capuche à son tour et deux filles fendirent la foule pour ensuite disparaître dans un tournant. Le Shérif était toujours interloqué qu'elle ait osé lui répondre ainsi, le maire semblait déçu et mon frère, tout comme moi, était figé sur place. Nous ne nous étions jamais trompé sur des sorcières, auparavant. Et qui était ces filles, bordel de merde ? Et c'était quoi, des « Mariniques » et des « Océliques » ? Il fallait l'admettre, elles semblaient en savoir long sur le sujet, plus que nous même. Enfin, l'assemblée se dispersa et nous rentrâmes avec le maire. Il nous montra les dossiers des enfants disparus, raconta les faits, et nous affirma qu'une vieille maison semblant habitée se trouvait dans les bois. Une première piste, en somme. Mon « alarme » sonna et je m'éloignais de quelques pas, avant de m'injecter mon antidote à ma maladie du sucre (NDA : Je déteste tout ce qui touche le sujet des aiguilles alors je ne vais jamais abordé le sujet sous toutes ses coutures). - Sinon, il y a un endroit où on eut boire un coup, dans cette ville paumée ? demandais-je après qu'il fut décidé que nous irions demain matin, la nuit étant trop dangereuse. Le maire ascquisa, et nous nous rendîmes ensuite dans une auberge pour boire quelques verres.[Chapter 2] La soirée se passa sans encombres, si on oublie le fait qu'on a dû fuir un fan-club, qu'on a rembarré un fanatique un peu effrayant, qu'un pisteur a explosé et que j'ai une horrible gueule de bois, en plus du fait que j'ai dû rentrer seul étant donné que mon frère passait la nuit avec une de ses conquêtes d'un soir. Nous sommes désormais le lendemain matin, en train d'arpenter la forêt à la recherche de la maison sûrement occupée par une sorcière. Celle-ci était d'ailleurs en vue. - Tu veux cogner ? demandais-je à mon frère. Mais avant qu'il n'ait pu répondre, un cri horrible fendit l'air, suivit d'un vacarme assourdissant dans le précédent silence qui occupait la place. Nous entrâmes en trombe, pour trouver la sorcière se faire transpercer de part et d'autre par deux tisonniers, avant de se faire égorger par les deux filles d'hier. - Et une de plus ! s'exclama joyeusement la blonde. Elle portait toujours sa capuche, et je me demandais bien pourquoi. Pourtant, elle la rabaissa. Elle et son amie ne semblaient pas nous avoir remarqué. Elles jetèrent le corps dans le four allumé à côté d'elles, puis se rapprochèrent un peu. La brune sortit un livre épais et parcheminé. - C'était quelle sorte, à ton avis ? demanda-t-elle en sortant un crayon de sa poche et en tournant frénétiquement les pages jusqu'à un complètement vierge. - Et bien, elle avait des cornes, un teint verdâtre, des dents très petites, mais pointues, et ses cheveux étaient emmêlés de vase, récita Ali. J'imagine que c'était une Marécalique. - Tu as vraiment un bon sens de l'observation, Alicia, la complimenta son amie. Elle se mit à écrire rapidement dans le livre. Moi, je rigolais intérieurement car elles n'avaient toujours pas remarqué notre présence. - Je vais essayer de trouver sa baguette, ça nous rapportera peut être plus de renseignements, proposa la blondinette, apparemment songeuse. Parce que ça commence à devenir étrange. D'abord une Marinique en plein centre ville, et ensuite une Marécalique dans la forêt, loin de tout marécage ou source d'eau potentielle. Elle se retourna, et se figea en nous voyant. Elle lâcha un juron, faisant relever la tête de la brunette, et celle-ci se figea à son tour en nous apercevant. - Quel langage malpropre pour une si jeune fille, se moqua Gretel. Je trouve que c'est scandaleux ! - Tout à fait d'accord, mon frère, c'est honteux d'utiliser de telles paroles ! ajoutais-je avec un rictus. - Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici, vous deux ? demanda la dénommée Alicia d'un ton agressif. - Du calme, on venait faire notre travail, mais on est apparemment arrivés trop tard, répondis-je. Vous faites ça souvent, piquer le boulot des autres ? - Nous avons autant de droits que vous de chasser ces horribles créatures, et encore plus de raisons ! siffla la blonde. Elle rigolait, j'espère ! On avait les meilleures raisons du monde de tuer cette vermine. Et puis, elles étaient jeunes, mêmes pas des adultes, selon moi. - On peut faire quelque chose d'autre pour vous ? proposa la brune d'un ton beaucoup plus conciliant. - Cette maison ainsi que la sorcière dont vous venez de vous débarrasser étaient un possible piste pour retrouver les enfants disparus, dit mon frère. Vous avez trouvé quelque chose qui peut nous aider ? - Non. Maintenant, dégagez ! Vous ne savez même pas à qui vous avez affaire et on ne veut pas d'amateurs dans les pattes ! cracha la première. Non mais quel culot ! Nous, des amateurs ? On chassait des sorcières depuis plus longtemps qu'elles, et c'est nous qui étions supposés être des novices ? Quoique l'épisode au village laissait penser le contraire. - C'est nous que tu traites de débutants ? s'énerva Gretel. - Tu vois d'autres idiots dans le coin, peut être ? le provoqua-t-elle. - Alicia, cesse immédiatement ! intervient Éliane en lui posant une main sur l'épaule. Ils n'ont rien fait et sont de notre côté, alors arrête de les provoquer ainsi. Alicia marmonna quelques jurons puis replaça sa capuche, avant de sortir d'un pas furieux à l'extérieur, nous bousculant au passage. - Je suis désolée pour son comportement, elle n'aime pas les étrangers, grimaça son amie. Enfin, mon nom est Éliane et la furie qui vient de sortir est ma meilleure amie, Alicia. - Je suis Hansel, et voici mon crétin de frère, Gretel, répondis-je avec un sourire en coin. Une bonne claque derrière la tête me répondit. La fille devant nous referma alors son livre, le fourra dans sa besace, et s'avança vers nous. - On a trouvé ça sur l'une des étagères, dit-elle en nous tendant un rouleau de parchemin. J'espère que ça vous sera utile. Gretel le prit, et elle sortit de la maison à son tour. Nous allâmes à l'extérieur peu après, mais aucune trace des deux filles. - Elles sont bizarres, tu ne trouves pas ? Demandais-je. Surtout la blonde. - Quelque chose me dit qu'on les reverra très bientôt, de toute façon, répondit mon frère. Allez, on retourne en ville.[Chapter 3] Le parchemin que nous avait remit Éliane était assez révélateur. Il s'agissait d'une carte des constellations et des phases de la lune, où figurait d'ailleurs la Lune de Sang. C'était une lune très sacrée pour les sorcières, et les plus grands sabbats de l'histoire se déroulaient durant cette période. Ça ne faisait aucun doute, l'enlèvement des enfants, et cette lune, étaient reliés. Mais par quoi, et pourquoi ? En plus, la venue des deux autres filles correspondait avec toute cette histoire, et je me posais de plus en plus de questions. Il fallait les retrouver, elles en savaient sûrement plus que nous ! - Je sais à quoi tu pense, frérot, et je suis tout à fait d'accord, me dit soudain Gretel. J'imagine qu'elles sont dans la forêt à traquer d'autres sorcières, on n'a qu'à aller chercher. - Allons y, avant qu'il ne fasse nuit, conclus-je en armant mon arbalète. Nous prîmes quelques armes en plus et, après m'être à nouveau injecté mon antidote, nous sortîmes de la ville pour nous rendre dans la forêt. Nous nous mîmes à l'arpenter en long, en large et en travers, quand nous entendîmes un cri. C'était celui d'une petite fille, sept ans tout au plus. Nous nous mîmes à courir en direction dudit cri et aperçûmes une fillette à l'air effrayé prise au piège avec une sorcière hideuse. Mais bon, toutes les sorcières sont hideuses alors… Gretel sortit son gun et le pointa vers la tête de l'immonde créature mais, avant qu'il n'ai pu appuyer sur la gâchette, une silhouette encapuchonnée sauta dans sa ligne de tire, derrière la sorcière, sortis une dague et trancha sans plus de cérémonies son cou. Le sang gicla, le corps s'effondra et la sorcière poussa un râle écoeurant avant de s'éteindre pour de bon. À côté, la fillette était terrifiée et ne lâchais pas des yeux le cadavre. La silhouette s'agenouilla devant elle et baissa sa capuche pour ne pas lui faire peur davantage. Oh bordel ! C'est la brunette. - Bonjours, je suis Éliane, dit-elle doucement (on pouvait l'entendre dans le silence de la forêt). Comment t'appelles-tu ? - Mélina, souffla la gamine. - Et bien, Mélina, tu n'as plus rien à craindre, maintenant. Moi et mon amie allons te ramener chez toi, d'accord ? Et tu pourras retrouver tes parents sans problèmes, affirma-t-elle. L'enfant se releva en tremblant légèrement, tout comme Éliane. Je sentis soudain quelque chose de froid sous ma gorge et, du coin de l'œil, je vis mon frère menacé par une lame collée contre son cou. - Éli ! Regarde qui j'ai trouvé ! s'écria soudain notre « agresseur ». - Salut, Blondie, grimaçais-je. Elle appuya plus fortement sur son arme, et je me tus, ne désirant pas me faire décapiter. - Avancez et, au moindre geste brusque, je vous égorge comme des porcs, capiche ? siffla-t-elle entre ses dents. Nous acquiesçâmes et nous nous mîmes à avancer, pour finalement arriver dans la clairière et rejoindre Éliane. - Alicia, arrêtes de les menacer ! s'exaspéra-t-elle. - Ils nous espionnaient et le connard de gauche s'apprêtait à te tirer dessus avec son gun, répondit-t-elle. - Hey, je ne suis pas… commença mon frère. Elle appuya plus fortement sur sa gorge, l'incitant au silence. - Je suis certaine qu'il y a une explication, soupira la brune. - Il y a toujours des explications. Aller, en s'en débarrasse maintenant ! supplia presque la blonde. - Pour traumatiser à vie l'enfant ? Sûrement pas, relâche les, et je ne le répéterais pas ! Elle grommela une réponse inintelligible et retira ses lames en reculant légèrement. Je me massais le cou, heureux de me savoir entier. - Que faites-vous ici ? demanda alors Éliane. - Nous vous cherchions, déclara crument mon jumeau. Je pus voir Alicia se braquer. - Je le savais ! cracha-t-elle en dégainant un poignard. - Ali ! la sermonna son amie, cette fois vraiment à bout. - On vous cherchait parce qu'on est convaincus que vous en savez plus que vous ne voulez l'admettre et qu'on est prêt à vous aider, ajoutais-je. - Et qui te dit que nous voulons de votre aide ? Qui… siffla la blondinette. - Pourquoi me menaçais-tu ? la coupa Éliane en fixant mon frère. - Je m'apprêtais à tirer sur la sorcière mais tu es tombée dans ma ligne de tir, expliqua-t-il. - Et bien sûr, tu n'as pas baissé ton arme, ricana l'autre. Pathétique comme excuse ! - Elle a pas tort sur ce coup là, pourquoi t'as pas baissé ton gun ? demandais-je à voix basse. - Elle portait une capuche, ça aurait très bien put être une seconde sorcière, se défendit Gretel. - Bon, je vois que ce n'était qu'un malentendu, dans ce cas, conclut Éliane. - Au risque de me répéter, qu'est-ce qui vous dit qu'on en sait plus que vous ? Et pourquoi on vous aiderait ? intervient alors Alicia. Parce que, contrairement à ce que vous pensez, ce n'est pas nous qui sommes en difficulté, mais bien vous. - Vous utilisez plusieurs thèmes et noms concernant les sorcières, jugé leurs origines et leur vie grâce à leur baguette et semblez marquée par une connaissance trop grande pour votre âge, expliquais-je calmement. Alicia baissa alors sa capuche, dévoilant son visage. - On ne sait rien du tout. Soudain, son regard se troubla quelques secondes, puis afficha une mine horrifiée. - À TERRE ! hurla-t-elle. Instinctivement, mon jumeau et moi-même obéîmes, tout comme Éliane et Alicia. La gamine, que nous avions jusque là oublié, semblait être possédée, et un immense explosion détona au dessus de nos têtes. Sans perdre de temps, Alicia se jeta sur elle avec une dague argentée, et se mis à combattre l'enfant, qui se défendait avec des doigts, qui étaient devenus des griffes aiguisées, son visage horriblement déformé. - Éliane, grouille toi ! s'écria-t-elle quand son bras se fit lacérer. - Je me dépêche, patience ! répondit nerveusement Éliane en fouillant dans un sac au sol. Mais je ne sais pas quelle… - Sablante d'Asie ! la coupa son amie. - Une seconde, une seconde, une seconde, marmonna-t-elle. Pourtant, elle ne semblait pas trouver ce qu'elle cherchait, et je voyais bien qu'Alicia ne tiendrait plus très longtemps. En effet, elle s'était retrouvée désarmée et se contentais désormais d'éviter les coups. En ayant assez, Gretel sorti son gun et visa la tête, avant de tirer. Pourtant, manque de bol, la balle rebondit sur la peau de la sorcière et c'est Alicia qui se prit le coup. - PUTAIN ! Vociféra-t-elle. C'est qui le connard qui a fait ça, que je lui troue la peau ! Je vais le castrer, le sale fils de … Mon frère pâlit en l'entendant, et Alicia s'effondra par terre tout en continuant à se défendre et à cracher des insultes à tout va. - Je l'ais ! s'écria alors Éliane en brandissant une fiole. Elle courut vers la sorcière en débouchant la fiole et versa un liquide fumant dessus. Aussitôt, la créature cessa de se battre et se mit à hurler pendant que sa peau se mit è se faire gruger par le liquide. Bien vite, il ne resta plus qu'une masse difforme en bouillie étendue au sol, et le silence revint s'installer dans la clairière. Un gémissement de douleur résonna peu après. Je regardais Alicia, par terre, se tenir l'épaule en serrant les dents. Du sang s'écoulait lentement et poissait ses habits. Oh merde, la balle de Gretel ! Celui-ci s'agenouilla d'ailleurs près d'elle. - Désolé, je… commença-t-il. - C'EST TOI ! C'est toi qui a fait ça ! Oh, je te jure, quand je serais rétablie tu vas entendre parler de moi, je vais te… s'énerva-t-elle. Attirée par les cris, Éliane se tourna vers son amie et la fit taire d'un geste sec de la main. Elle s'assit à côté d'elle et, sans attendre, enfonça deux doigts dans la blessure. - AÏEUH ! Mais ça fait mal, putain de bordel de merde ! se plaignit la blonde. - Oh, est-ce que tu vas pleurer ? me moquais-je gentiment. Elle m'envoya un regard noir. - Dit celui dont le frère est un triple idiot et qui m'a tiré dessus, répondit-elle hargneusement. - Hey ! Je ne t'ais pas tiré dessus, mais bien sur la sorcière ! protesta mon jumeau. - Quand on disait que vous étiez des débutants, c'était pas une blague, répondit-elle sérieusement. Les Sablantes d'Asie sont très douées pour les illusions et possèdent une peau plus solide que le métal. Seules les armes blanches peuvent la blesser, et seul le sel dissous du Triangle des Bermudes peut en venir à bout. Elles sont peu nombreuses, mais terriblement dangereuses. - Et ose venir nous dire que vous ne savez rien du tout, ricanais-je. Elle se tut, s'étant piégée elle-même. Elle poussa soudain un petit cri et Éliane nous montra sa main pleine de sang frais, une balle d'argent entre les doigts. - Et voilà le travail ! Soudain, la blessure d'Alicia se mit à rapetisser, non, se refermer, pour finalement disparaître. Elles échangèrent un regard gêné alors que nous les fixions, interloqués. - Je crois que vous nous devez vraiment des explications, cette fois, déclara mon frère. - En effet, soupira Éliane, mais c'est une bien longue et triste histoire qu'est la nôtre, et le temps vient à manquer, alors nous passerons la nuit ici. - Oulala, quand tu sort ce genre de vocabulaire, j'ai toujours l'impression que tu es possédée, rigola alors Alicia. Mais tu es sûr qu'on peut leur dire à eux ? Ils sont peut-être des leurs. - Ils sont bien trop ignorants pour être avec eux, protesta Éliane. - Ils font peut-être semblant ! persista Alicia. Ils… - Possèdent-ils le Fluide ? la coupa Éliane. Alicia se figea quelques secondes, ses yeux se voilèrent, puis elle se reprit et secoua la tête à l'affirmative. - Oui, grogna-t-elle. Ils l'ont, ils sont… - Mais ? la coupa la brune. - Ils n'en sont pas conscients, avoua Alicia. Mais ça ne prouve rien ! Ils ont l'air de Traqueurs, ajouta-t-elle plus bas. - Moi, je trouve surtout qu'ils sont perdus, ricana la brunette. - Bon, admettons que tu ais raison, tu penses que ce sont eux ? - Sûrement, sinon ils nous auraient déjà tué. - C'est bon, j'abdique, soupira la blonde. Mais ne me fais pas regretter. Elle s'éloignèrent un peu pour parler. Moi, je comprenais rien à rien. Eux ? Leurs ? Dafuck ? Je suis complètement largué. - Dis, t'as compris quelque chose ? demandais-je à Gretel. Mais il semblait aussi perdu que moi, et secoua négativement la tête. Les deux filles revinrent alors vers nous. - Est-ce que les sorts des sorcières ont un effet quelconque sur vous ? demanda abruptement Blondie. - Euh… non, pourquoi ? demanda Gretel. - BANCO ! s'exclama alors la brune. J'avais raison ! - Alors c'est vraiment… eux ? Elle semblait méfiante, déçue, dédaigneuse et heureuse en même temps. - Oui, c'est eux, affirma la brune d'un ton ferme. Je vous laisse, je vais chercher du bois pour le feu. - Dis plutôt que c'est pour vérifier si on peut passer du temps ensemble sans s'entretuer, marmonna-t-elle entre ses dents. - Tu me connais trop bien ! rigola Éliane en s'éloignant vers les bois. - Je te déteste ! s'écria Alicia alors que son amie lui tournant le dos. - Et moi, je sais parfaitement que c'est faux ! répondit la brune sur le même ton avant de disparaître dans la forêt. Et voilà comment on s'est retrouvés en plein milieu de la forêt avec une fille complètement barjo et sa meilleure amie un peu moins pire qu'elle. Enfin, ça, c'est si la brunette réussi à revenir avant la tombée de la nuit.[Chapter 4] - Tu n'es pas inquiète ? Je me posais exactement la même question que mon frère. - Pas vraiment. Comment pouvait-elle ne pas être inquiète ? Nous sommes dans la forêt, la nuit était tombée depuis peu, des sorcières toutes plus dangereuses les unes que les autres rodaient aux alentours à la recherche de proies potentielles, sa meilleure amie s'était aventurée seule dans les bois, elle n'avait pas redonné signe de vie depuis au moins une heure, et elle, elle gardait un visage impassible et ne s'inquiétait pas. C'était… choquant. - Éliane est parfaitement capable de se débrouiller seule. Je vous mentirais si je vous disais que je ne m'inquiétais pas, mais ça ne sert à rien de le montrer puisque ce serait stupide de notre part d'aller la chercher. Elle est apte à survivre une nuit entière, seule, dans une forêt pleine de sorcières. Elle l'a déjà fait auparavant, alors ce n'est pas une petite heure qui va réellement me faire stresser, expliqua Alicia. - Oh putain, elle sait parler pour une autre raison que nous insulter ou sacrer à tout va ! me moquais-je. Elle me lança un regard noir, et je lui rendis bien. POV Alicia : Putain, pourquoi EUX ? Nous étions pourtant bien, juste Éli et moi. Nous avions notre petite vie, une routine quoi. Et voilà que deux jumeaux complètement barjos débarquaient avec leurs petites faces arrogantes et prétentieuses. Ils se disent chasseurs de sorcières, mais ce ne sont que des amateurs, des incapables. Enfin ! Tout le monde sait que des Sablantes d'Asie ont une peau imperméable à toute attaque, qu'elles sont capable de créer des illusions et que seules les armes blanches peuvent vraiment les blesser, pas vraie ? Bon, d'accord, peut être pas tout le monde, mais quand même ! En plus, Éliane prend leur défense. Oui, ils sont jumeaux, oui, ils chassent des sorcières, oui, ils possèdent le Fluide, mais NON, je ne leur fais pas confiance. Ça ne peut pas être eux. Mais en quoi tous ces éléments sont-ils liés ? Vous le saurez plus tard. - Tu n'es pas inquiète ? Je savais que le barjo numéro deux, soit le dénommé Gretel, parlait d'Éli. - Pas vraiment. C'était plus ou moins un mensonge, mais je n'allais tout de même pas leur dire. Pourtant, devant leurs têtes de crétins choquées, je me sentis obligée de développer. - Éliane est parfaitement capable de se débrouiller seule. Je vous mentirais si je vous disais que je ne m'inquiétais pas, mais ça ne sert à rien de le montrer puisque ce serait stupide de notre part d'aller la chercher. Elle est apte à survivre une nuit entière, seule, dans une forêt pleine de sorcières. Elle l'a déjà fait auparavant, alors ce n'est pas une petite heure qui va réellement me faire stresser, expliquais-je. - Oh putain, elle sait parler pour une autre raison que nous insulter ou sacrer à tout va ! se moqua alors le barjo numéro un, soit Hansel. Je lui lançais un regard noir, qu'il me rendit bien. Non mais, il se prend pour qui, celui là ? - Je pourrais éteindre le feu en un claquement de doigts et vous abandonner ici sans aucun remord, lâchais-je froidement. Je pourrais vous égorger sur le champ sans aucun scrupule, alors je vous conseille vivement de me montrer un minimum de respect. - Et toi, tu te prends pour qui ? rétorqua Gretel. On est parfaitement en mesure de survivre sans toi, et si jamais tu tentais quelque chose contre nous, tu n'aurais aucune chance, à deux contre un, alors si quelqu'un devait montrer du respect envers les autres, c'est bien toi ! Tu nous es inférieure. J'éclatais d'un rire froid, sans joie. - Moi ? Inférieure à deux imbéciles comme vous ? Non mais vous déconnez, j'espère ! Je suis on ne peut plus en position de supériorité ici, je pourrais vous tuer en cinq secondes top chrono ! - Pas si on se charge de toi avant ! s'énerva Hansel. Il dégaina une lame et me la lança dessus. Non, il a pas osé, si ? Malgré la vitesse à laquelle tout s'était déroulé, je réussis à contrer l'attaque. Je levais ma main devant moi et la dague s'arrêta à un centimètre de mon visage. Oula, il vise drôlement bien, tout de même, la pointe de l'arme était exactement entre mes deux yeux. J'abaissais ma main et la dague retomba dans ma paume (la poignée, on s'entend bien). Je l'examinais quelques secondes, puis relevais la tête vers eux. Ils étaient figés. - C'est une bonne arme, dis-je pour briser le silence. Je la renvoyais à son destinataire et elle se ficha dans le sol, juste devant lui, le tirant de son état de choc. - Sorcellerie ! cracha-t-il en se levant d'un bond. - Pas du tout ! rétorquais-je, sur les nerfs aussi. - Alors c'était quoi, ça ? demanda Gretel, énervé lui aussi. - Heu… regardez, une envolée de castor ! hurlais-je en pointant le ciel. Leurs quelques secondes d'inattention me donnèrent un peu d'avance, et je me mis à courir. Je ne sais pas trop pourquoi mais, quand je les ais vu se lever, j'ai prit peur et je me suis enfuie. Je m'enfonçais dans la forêt, un mauvais pressentiment me saisissant violemment. Mais il ne me concernait pas, il concernait Éliane. Aussitôt, j'accélérais le pas, redoutant ce que j'allais voir. Ma meilleure amie, ma sœur, ma jumelle, celle qui me connaît le mieux, la seule personne à qui je tiens vraiment, est en danger. Bon, d'accord, on est toujours en danger, mais là, c'est différent. Quelque chose siffla à mon oreille droite et je vis une flèche se planter dans l'arbre devant moi. Je me retournais et vis les deux connards. Merde, je croyais les avoir semé ! Et re-merde, eux croyaient avoir affaire à une sorcière. Soudain, quelque chose s'enroula autour de mes jambes, me faisant trébucher. Je m'étalais au sol. Je me redressais le plus vite possible et mis à tirer frénétiquement sur les liens qui m'empêchaient de poursuivre ma course. Et ben, ils n'avaient peut être pas l'expérience, mais pour l'équipement, c'est une tout autre histoire ! Un cri déchira l'air, et mon sang se glaça. C'était celui d'Éli. Je tirais encore plus fort, tentant de me détacher, mais c'était peine perdue, les cordes étaient trop épaisses et trop solide. Je m'éraflais les mains à force de tirer dessus, et ça ne m'aidait pas du tout. Hansel et Gretel arrivèrent alors près de moi. Le premier me releva en me tenant solidement les bras derrière mon dos. Je me débattis, en vain. - Laissez moi ! hurlais-je. - Tu tentais de fuir ? se moqua Gretel. - Vous ne comprenez pas ! Éliane est en danger ! répondis-je en cessant de me débattre. Sans que je puisse les retenir, les larmes se mirent à dévaler mes joues. Mes jambes cédèrent sous mon poids, et je me mis à pleurer. Oui, pleurer, alors que ça faisait des années que plus une seule larme ne m'avait échappée. - S'il vous plait… elle est tout ce qu'il me reste, suppliais-je d'une voix brisée. POV Gretel : J'interrogeais mon frère du regard. Ce n'était vraiment, mais vraiment ps normal. Une sorcière ne peut pas pleurer, ne peut pas ressentir des sentiments. Se pourrait-il qu'elle nous dise la vérité ? Qu'elle ne soit pas une sorcière. Un cri déchira le silence qui s'était installé. Notre prisonnière s'agita et recommença à se débattre. - ÉLIANE ! ÉLIANE ! ÉLIIIIIIIII ! Elle hurlait et pleurait en même temps, et un seul regard avec mon frère me fit savoir qu'il était du même avis que moi. Je sortis un poignard et, sans plus de cérémonie, je tranchais les liens qui retenaient les jambes d'Alicia. Mon frère la relâcha alors qu'elle nous regardait faire, incrédule. - On est avec toi, mais à la moindre entourloupe, avertis-je en passant mon pouce sous mon cou. Elle hocha la tête, sécha ses larmes du revers de la main et se remis à courir vers la provenance du cri. Bien décidés à en savoir de quoi il en retourne, nous la suivîmes. POV Alicia : Je n'arrivais pas à y croire. Non seulement j'avais craqué devant deux parfaits inconnus et crétins de surcroit, mais en plus, ils m'avaient relâché ! J'arrivais dans une clairière et vis Éliane, couchée au sol, des sorcières toutes plus laides les unes que les autres l'encerclant. Divers blessures recouvraient ses bras et du sang coulait de ses plaies. La rage monta en moi et, sans plus attendre, je dégainais un bâton d'environ trente centimètres devant moi. J'appuyais sur un bouton et, aussitôt, le bâton s'allongea pour ensuite s'ouvrir en éventail à chaque extrémité, donnant ainsi une épée double de ma fabrication. Je sautais dans la mêlée et me mis à trancher têtes, bras et bustes qui se mettaient en travers de ma route. Mon seul objectif, désormais, était de me rendre jusqu'à Éli. Je réussis finalement à atteindre mon but et, malgré toutes les ennemies qui étaient toujours présentes, je laissais tomber mon arme et me penchais sur la poitrine d'Éli. Je soupirais de soulagement en entendant son cœur battre, et m'apprêtais à me relever pour achever le travail lorsque quelque chose de dur s'abattit sur mon crâne, me faisant sombrer sur le coup. Putain de bordel de merde ! Ma tête me fait un mal de chien ! Mais… attendez une seconde… où est-ce que je suis ? Je regardais autour de moi et vis que je me trouvais dans la forêt, dans la même clairière que la veille. J'entendis quelqu'un bouger à côté de moi et vis qu'il s'agissait d'Éliane. Aussitôt, je vérifiais ses bras et son visage, et vis que ses blessures s'étaient toutes refermées… sauf une. Ça arrivait de temps en temps, et la blessure finissait toujours par devenir une cicatrice. Enfin bon, j'étais en train de vérifier son pouls lorsqu'elle se redressa en courbant le dos vers l'avant, poussant un râle étranglé par la même occasion. - ALI ! Je posais une main rassurante sur son épaule et elle darda son regard sur moi. Après quoi, elle poussa un soupir de soulagement et me serra contre elle. Je répondis avec joie à son étreinte. - Non mais tu te rends compte de la peur que tu m'as faites ? demandais-je en me séparant d'elle. J'ais cru que tu étais morte lorsque je t'ais vu dans la clairière, baignant dans ton sang, j'ai cru mourir moi-même lorsque je t'ais entendu hurler ! - Les sorcières m'ont tendu une embuscade, je n'ai rien vu venir, s'excusa-t-elle. - Et bien, et bien, on a bien dormi ? se moqua une voix pour le moins familière. Je me retournais et vis Hansel, un peu plus loin, en train d'aiguiser une lame. Ma, lame. - Rends moi ça ! m'énervais-je en me levant. Sauf que je m'étais remis sur pieds trop vite et je fus prise d'un vertige. J'allais m'effondrer par terre mais une poigne solide me retint. Je tournais la tête et croisais le regard de Gretel. Je me dégageais d'un coup de bras et aidais Éliane à se relever. Elle tangua légèrement, mais réussi à garder son équilibre. - Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé ? demanda-t-elle alors que le barjo numéro un nous rejoignais. - Il se trouve que Blondie s'est jetée tête baissée dans la mêlée pour te rejoindre et qu'elle a eu la stupide idée de laisser tomber son arme pour vérifier si tu respirais encore, commença barjo numéro deux. - Résultat, une des sorcières a profité du fait qu'elle était désarmée et déconcentrée du combat pour l'assommer par derrière, poursuivit Hansel. - Mais, comme les héros que nous sommes, nous avons éliminé le reste de la vermine pour éviter qu'elle ne vous massacre pendant que vous, vous faisiez un petit somme, conclut Gretel. Je me retenais de faire un commentaire désobligeant. Après tout, ils nous avaient sauvé la vie MAIS ça ne veut pas dire que je les apprécie pour autant. - Merci beaucoup, dit Éliane avec un sourire. Sans vous, on serait sûrement à des lieux d'ici, maintenant. - Euh… tu veux dire qu'elles vous auraient tué ? tenta Hansel. - Non, elles ne veulent pas nous tuer, répondis-je. Elles veulent nous capturer, c'est pourquoi nous cachons notre visage sous des capuches la plupart du temps. - Et… m'invita Éli à poursuivre. - Nous aurions très bien pu nous débrouiller sans vous, mentis-je. Elle me fit les gros yeux, et je pliais l'échine. - Merci, grommelais-je. - Bon, maintenant que ça c'est fait, je propose qu'on vous explique, proposa Éli. - Bonne idée, parce que ça devient de plus en plus bizarre, se désespéra Gretel. - Attendez, j'ai juste une question, intervins-je. Pourquoi m'avoir laissé partir ? Vous aviez pourtant l'opportunité de me tuer, vous pensiez que j'étais une sorcière… - Et on le pense toujours ! me coupa Hansel. - Enfin bon, pourquoi m'avoir relâché ? demandais-je dans un soupir. Ils se regardèrent quelques secondes, semblant communiquer par une méthode propre à eux-mêmes. - On en sait fichtrement rien ! Lâcha finalement Gretel. Par contre, on a quand même prit soin de vous désarmer, vous savez, question de sécurité… - Bon, ça ne nous avance pas vraiment, mais on va faire avec, soupirais-je. Je me laissais retomber sur le sol, les jambes croisées, et attendis la suite. Éli m'imita bien vite. - Je vous conseille de vous asseoir, parce que ce qu'on va vous apprendre risque de vous choquer un peu, dit ma meilleure amie. Ils hésitèrent, puis finirent par faire de même. Et voilà, nous y étions ! C'était l'heure des révélations, l'heure de vérité, l'heure de leur apprendre leur destin, et le notre, par la même occasion.[Chapter 5] « C'était il y a 17 ans, maintenant. Les sorcières les plus puissantes du monde étaient toutes réunies pour le plus grand sabbat de l'histoire. Elles voulaient plonger le monde dans les ténèbres, afin d'en devenir les maitres. Pourtant, d'autres personnes avaient les même projets. Il s'agissait des sorciers. Ils étaient comme les sorcières, sauf qu'ils possédaient une apparence normale et qu'il s'agissait uniquement d'hommes. Un combat violent entre les sorciers et les sorcières s'engagea lors du sabbat, tandis que l'essence même d'un démon surpuissant s'ancrait à jamais dans le corps d'un nouveau né, offert en sacrifice ce soir là. Comprenant qu'ils ne pourraient en venir à bout, les sorciers fuirent. Ils invoquèrent bientôt un ange noir, un ange déchu, qui donna naissance à un autre enfant, possédant lui aussi des pouvoirs inimaginables. Les deux enfants étaient destinés à s'affronter pour le combat décisif, ils n'étaient que des armes aux yeux des sorciers et des sorcières. Pourtant, lors de leur première rencontre, à peine quelques années plus tard, un lien se forgea, et les deux enfants se mirent à se voir en cachette. Ils comprirent bien vite les intentions de leurs clans, et préférèrent fuir que de se combattre. Quand les sorciers et les sorcières comprirent que leur plan avait échoué, ils se mirent à poursuivre leurs anciens protégés pour s'approprier leur puissance. Les enfants grandirent, fuyant sans arrêt, tuant leurs poursuivants lorsqu'il le fallait. Ils ont fini par comprendre que ce n'était pas en fuyant que tout allait s'arranger, aussi se mirent-ils à chasser les sorcières, les sorciers ne se montrant pas. Ils préféraient leur envoyer des groupes d'hommes, surnommés les Traqueurs. Ceux-ci étaient des hommes possédant une grande force et une cruauté sans pareille, les chassant à travers le monde pour le compte des sorciers. Ceux-ci étaient plus rares que les sorcières, et plus durs à éliminer, mais au bout d'un certain temps, les deux enfants, désormais adolescents, trouvèrent leur point faible, purent mieux se défendre. Ils étaient en train de tuer une sorcière lorsque celle-ci clama une prophétie parlant de la fin des sorcières et des sorciers, désignant de ce fait quatre élus, dont les adolescents. Ceux-ci se mirent à arpenter le monde à la recherche des deux autres élus, afin de mettre un terme au règne de terreur des sorcières et des sorciers, pour de bon. Et aujourd'hui, les adolescents presque adultes ont enfin trouvé les deux élus manquants et, ensemble, ils accompliront leur destin. » Voilà, c'était dit. - Éliane et moi sommes les enfants de l'histoire, déclarais-je. Et vous êtes les deux élus manquants. Ensemble, nous avons un destin commun : détruire les forces du mal pour de bon. Nous vous avons cherché, nous vous avons trouvé, et désormais, notre destin est en marche, expliquais-je. - Voilà pourquoi nous possédons des pouvoirs. Mon père était un sorcier, et ma mère, un ange déchu, et Aryane est la fille d'une sorcière et d'un démon, ce qui fait de nous… des sang-mêlé. Quand à vous, vous êtes les fils d'un sorcier et d'une sorcière, unis dans la mort malgré les mésententes des deux peuples, ajouta Éliane. Ils étaient… choqués. Ils restèrent immobiles pendant plusieurs minutes, mais je comprenais parfaitement leur réaction. C'est que ça peut être choquant, quand même, une nouvelle comme celle-là. Hansel fut le premier à sortir de sa transe. - Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais je vous fais confiance, soupira-t-il. Tiens ! Il me rendit ma lame, et Gretel revint à lui à son tour. - Est-ce qu'on a des pouvoirs, nous aussi ? demanda-t-il avec une sorte d'excitation dans la voix. - Pour sûr que vous en avez ! répondis-je. Et on va vous aider à les contrôler, compter sur nous. Mais les entrainements ne seront pas de tout repos, ça c'est sûr. - On est prêts ! affirma Hansel en se levant. - Ça, c'est à nous de le juger, répliqua sérieusement Éliane en les regardant tour à tour. Vous devrez nous écouter, désormais, car si vous tentez quoi que ce soit sans nous, ça pourrait vous être fatal. - Du moins, en ce qui concerne la magie, ajoutais-je. C'est moi qui m'occuperais de ça. Éliane, quand à elle, va vous réapprendre tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur les sorcières. - Hey, on est pas stupides non plus, tu sais, rétorqua Gretel en fronçant les sourcils. - Quelles sont les sorcières les plus dangereuses d'Afrique ? Comment peut-on éliminer une Équatoriale ? Quel est l'ennemi ancestral des Occidalières ? Quand le pouvoir des Canyères sont-ils à leur plus faible ? demandais-je. Ils écarquillèrent les yeux alors qu'Éliane étouffait difficilement un rire. - Ce ne sont pas vos méthodes de combat qui sont à revoir, mais bien votre culture générale, expliqua-t-elle en souriant. - Mais à quoi ça vous avance de savoir tout… ça ? Je veux dire, vous prenez une baguette, vous identifiez la sorcière et, à part savoir parfois comment la tuer, ça sert à quoi ? demanda Gretel. - Comme tu l'as dit, à la tuer en général, mais aussi pour découvrir leurs intentions, comme organiser des Sabbats ou des sacrifices. Par exemple, une Marinique, une Marécalique et une Sablante d'Asie dans une forêt et en ville, ce n'est absolument pas normal, vous comprenez ? Le fait est que toutes les sorcières du monde semblent se réunir ici pour le plus grand Sabbat de l'histoire, qui aura lieu lors de la Lune de Sang. Douze enfants seront sacrifiés et, grâce à la cérémonie, les sorcières ne pourront plus jamais être brûlées, elles seront invulnérables au feu, expliqua-je. - Mais il manque encore des enfants et… ajouta Éliane. - Combien d'enfants ont disparu ? la coupais-je. Elle comprit alors que je ne voulais pas le dire immédiatement. Les deux garçons semblèrent réfléchir, puis se regardèrent. - Onze. Six garçons et cinq filles, répondit Gretel. Et grâce à la carte lunaire qu'Éliane nous a donné, on était déjà au courant pour la Lune de Sang. - Il faut immédiatement retourner en ville ! s'exclama Éliane. Les sorcières ne resteront pas inactives bien longtemps, il faut qu'on aille en ville trouver la prochaine victime ! Je me rendis alors compte que le soleil était en train de se coucher. Une journée était déjà passée ! Sans attendre plus longtemps, nous réunîmes nos affaires et, après qu'Éli et moi fûmes dissimulées sous des capuches, nous nous mîmes à courir en direction de la ville d'Augsbourg. Le soleil venait à peine de disparaître derrière les pics dégarnis qui trônaient à l'horizon lorsque nous atteignîmes enfin notre but, mais il était trop tard. L'une des maisons était en feu, et les flammes se propageaient rapidement aux habitations voisines. Malgré tout, nous tentâmes le tout pour le tout et entrâmes dans la ville. Le feu n'était apparemment qu'une distraction. - Alicia, Gretel, allez éteindre le feu, ordonna alors ma meilleure amie. Hansel et moi irons nous occuper de l'enfant. - Pourquoi se séparer ? Et pourquoi tu ne t'occupe pas de la maison avec Alicia pendant qu'on s'occupe de la fillette ? demanda Gretel. - On vous expliquera plus tard, d'accord ? Ce n'est pas vraiment le moment, répondis-je. Allons y, et vite ! Les garçons finirent par accepter, et je me dirigeais vers les maisons enflammées avec Gretel pendant que les deux autres s'éloignaient dans la direction opposée. Les cris des villageois s'intensifièrent lorsque le hurlement d'un enfant retentit à l'intérieur de la maison, qui était sur le point de s'effondrer. Mon sang ne fit qu'un tour et, sans attendre, je me jetais dans l'habitation sur le point de s'effondrer. Je cherchais d'abord à me repérer, puis avisais un escalier à moitié détruit. Un poutre tomba à quelques centimètres de moi, et je l'enjambais pour monter quatre à quatre les escaliers. Un nouveau cri d'enfant retentit de derrière une des portes au fond du couloir, qui était fermée. Je tentais de l'ouvrir, mais c'était peine perdue. À bout de patience et sachant qu'il ne nous restait pas beaucoup de temps, je la défonçais. Je m'approchais alors d'une petite forme recroquevillée dans le fond de la chambre qui commençait elle aussi à être la proie des flammes, et je m'en approchais. C'était l'enfant qui avait hurlé, un petit garçon d'environ six ans, apparemment. - Maman ? demanda-t-il en levant des yeux larmoyants sur moi. - Non, dis-je doucement. Je ne suis pas ta maman, mais je suis ici pour t'aider à la retrouver. Suis moi, il faut sortir au plus vite ! - Non ! Mon papa il dit qu'il ne faut pas suivre les inconnues qui cachent leur visage, parce que ce sont des sorcières, répondit-il en reculant vivement. Je soupirais, puis dévoilais mon visage. - Moi, je suis l'ennemie des sorcières, c'est mon travail de les tuer. Veux-tu retrouver ta maman et ton papa, maintenant ? Viens, on va sortir de cette maison. Il réfléchit quelques secondes, puis accepta. Je lui tendis la main pour l'aider à se relever, et le regardais droit dans les yeux. - Comment tu t'appelles ? - Maxence. - Maintenant Maxence, tu vas faire tout ce que je te dis, d'accord ? Il hocha la tête. - Très bien. Tu vas t'accrocher à ma jambe et me suivre en faisant bien attention à rester caché sous ma cape, d'accord ? Ça va te protéger du feu, et ne respire qu'à travers ta tunique. Tu as compris ? Il hocha à nouveau la tête, et se cacha sous ma cape en s'accrochant à ma jambe droite. Je nous menais vers la porte de la chambre, mais le plancher craqua et, d'un coup, tout s'effondra. Je créais de justesse une bulle protectrice, surtout pour le gamin puisque que le feu ne pouvait rien me faire, et attendis quelques secondes avant de repousser les débris qui nous empêchaient de sortir. Je réussis finalement à m'extirper et vis Gretel qui s'approchait vers moi. Il tandis légèrement les bras, apparemment au cas où je m'effondrerais, mais je l'ignorais et me dirigeais vers les parents en pleurs, Maxence toujours accroché à ma jambe. Arrivée devant eux, j'ouvris ma cape et l'enfant se jeta dans les bras de ses parents. Ils me remercièrent une bonne dizaine de fois avant de s'éloigner au pas de course. Je revins ensuite vers Gretel, bien décidée à éteindre le feu. POV Gretel : Avant que je n'ais pu faire quoi que ce soit pour la retenir, Alicia disparut dans les flammes de la maison. Bordel, mais elle est complètement folle ! Elle va se faire tuer, et après, c'est moi qui vais mourir de la main d'Éliane ! Râhhh, tout est si compliqué ! Tout ça me dépasse. Une prophétie, des sang-mêlé, un destin, des pouvoirs, des sorciers… c'est complètement fou et, pourtant, je sais au plus profond de moi que c'est la vérité. Soudain, la maison s'écroula d'un coup, et aux cris des villageois se mêlèrent les pleurs. Je me précipitais vers les décombres encore en feu et, alors que j'allais me jeter dedans pour retrouver Alicia, une main repoussa violemment les débris et la jeune fille se dressa devant moi. Elle marcha péniblement dans ma direction, et je tendis les bras pour la réceptionner si elle venait à s'effondrer. Pourtant, elle m'ignora complètement et se dirigea vers un couple qui sanglotait amèrement. Elle écarta un pant de sa cape, et je vis un petit garçon d'environ six ans sortir pour se jeter dans les bras de ses parents. Ceux-ci, d'abords incrédules, se confondirent ensuite en remerciements et s'éloignèrent en vitesse avec leur fils. Elle revint vers moi, et, malgré sa capuche, je pu aisément deviner son air sérieux. - Pas un mot à Éli, comprit ? - Compte sur moi, elle me fera la peau aussi, sinon. Elle peut être vraiment flippante, ton amie, répondis-je en souriant. Je distinguais ses lèvres esquisser un fin sourire, mais qui disparut bien vite. - Suis moi, il faut éteindre le feu avant qu'il ne se propage encore plus, ordonna-t-elle. Me demandant ce qui allait suivre, j'obéis, et la suivis jusque dans une ruelle. - Très bien, prêt pour ta première leçon de magie ? demanda-t-elle en se stoppant et tendant les mains devant elle, vers la maison. - Quoi ? - Suis bien mes instructions, d'accord ? Concentre toi, fais fit de toute l'agitation autour, concentre toi sur la chaleur des flammes, imagina la parcourir tes veines, expliqua-t-elle. - Mais pourquoi tu le fais pas ? paniquais-je. - Le feu est trop gros, je ne peux pas le faire sans ton aide, alors tu fais ce que je te dis ou c'est fichu ! Je tentais de me calmer et calquais ma respiration sur la sienne. J'obéis à ses instructions et, bien vite, une immense chaleur monta en moi. - Je… je crois que je l'ais ! dis-je. - Très bien ! Maintenant, imagine la chaleur entrer dans ton cœur et y disparaître pour de bon, d'accord ? Imagine que les flammes en toi se font un chemin jusqu'à ton cœur pour s'y évaporer, répliqua-t-elle. Je fermais les yeux, et obéis. Au bout de quelques minutes, nous parvînmes enfin à éteindre le brasier. Sans vraiment pouvoir l'expliquer, je fus pris d'un vertige et tanguais dangereusement sur le côté, mais Alicia me retint. - Ne t'inquiète pas, ça fait toujours ça les premières fois, me rassura-t-elle. Tu vas t'en remettre complètement dans quelques minutes. Elle m'offrit alors un premier sourire franc, auquel je répondis avec joie. Je pus finalement me remettre sur pieds et, pendant que les villageois s'affairaient autour des décombres, nous nous mîmes à arpenter les rues pour retrouver les deux autres. À un tournant, j'entrais en collision avec mon frère. Il semblait paniqué. - Hansel ? m'inquiétais-je. Hey, Alicia, j'ai trouvé mon frère ! La jeune fille était en train de chercher plus loin. Elle arriva au pas de course auprès de nous, et ses yeux s'écarquillèrent. - Où est Éli ? Hansel baissa les yeux, et Alicia fit un pas en arrière en étouffant un sanglot. - Non… non, non, NON ! De rage, elle frappa dans un mur, qui éclata et se fissura sur plusieurs mètres. Je reculais, sidéré. C'est qu'elle frappe fort, et je ne voulais surtout pas faire les frais de sa colère. Puis, elle se retourna vers nous, sa capuche tombant à l'arrière et dévoilant un visage déformé par la rage, la tristesse et l'inquiétude. - Comment? demanda-t-elle simplement.[Chapter 6] POV Hansel : - Alicia, Gretel, allez éteindre le feu, ordonna alors la brunette. Hansel et moi irons nous occuper de l'enfant. - Pourquoi se séparer ? Et pourquoi tu ne t'occupe pas de la maison avec Alicia pendant qu'on s'occupe de la fillette ? demanda Gretel. - On vous expliquera plus tard, d'accord ? Ce n'est pas vraiment le moment, répondit Alicia d'un air pressé. Allons y, et vite ! Nous finîmes par accepter et, tandis que mon jumeau et Blondie partaient en courant vers les habitations enflammées, je courrais avec Éliane jusqu'au bureau du Shérif. - Les dossiers des enfants de la ville, vite ! le pressais-je alors qu'il nous fixait avec des yeux ronds. Il pointa simplement une commode, et je sortis une pile de feuilles. Éliane, qui était partie dans a pièce d'à côté, revint avec les avis de recherches des gamins disparus. - Janvier… décembre… avril… février… mai… juin… marmonnais-je en triant rapidement les parchemins. - Mars… septembre… novembre… octobre… aout… Il manque le juillet ! ajouta Éliane en fouillant frénétiquement dans les dossiers. Il faut une petite fille née en juillet ! Nous cherchâmes pendant quelques minutes. - Je l'ai ! m'exclamais-je alors en brandissant une feuille. Je me tournais vers le Shérif, qui nous regardait faire, sidéré. - Connaissez-vous cette enfant ? demandais-je. - Je… bien sûr, c'est la petite Marie, balbutia-t-il. - Où habite-t-elle ? demanda Éliane. - Enfin, je n'ais pas le droit de… protesta-t-il. - C'est une question de vie ou de mort, l'enfant est en grand danger ! éclatais-je. - Je… à l'entrée du village, la première maison sur le côté, lâcha-t-il finalement. Sans attendre plus longtemps, nous sortîmes en coup de vent et nous dirigeâmes vers la place indiquée. Pourtant, alors que nous arrivions devant l'habitation, la fenêtre du haut éclata et un corps tomba devant nous, fusillée. Des cris retentirent et une femme sortit par la porte avec la fillette que nous cherchions. - Pas si vite, sorcière ! s'interposa Éliane. - Tiens tiens, une des sang-mêlé, ricana la femme. C'était étrange, la femme était apparemment une sorcière, mais elle avait un visage normal. Cheveux noirs, peau pâle… ça devait être une des rares à pouvoir changer d'apparence. Un troll sortit alors de l'ombre, se saisit de l'enfant et l'envoya dans une cage grossièrement construite de ronces. Il saisit ensuite la charrette dans laquelle se trouvait la cage et se mit à marcher d'un pas lourd en direction de la sortie de la ville. J'hésitais. Devais-je sauver la gamine ou aider Éliane à combattre la sorcière, qui avait pris une apparence franchement dégoutante. - Va la sauver ! hurla alors la brunette en évitant un coup. J'hésitais encore quelques secondes, puis obéis. Je me mis à courir après le monstre, qui venait de sortir de la ville, mais j'arrivais trop tard, et il s'enfonça dans la forêt. Sachant que je ne pourrais le rattraper alors qu'il faisait nuit, je laissais tomber et revins à la ville en quelques minutes pour aider Éliane. Pourtant, lorsque j'arrivais là où je l'avais laissé, je ne trouvais qu'un mur tâché d'une écriture ensanglanté. La première Sang-Mêlé est notre Vous êtes les prochains ! MERDE ! Merde, merde, merde ! Elles avaient eu Éliane ! Oh, non seulement c'est de ma faute, mais en plus, Alicia va me tuer ! Ah la la, je suis foutu. Je me mis à arpenter les rues en direction des maisons en feu, qui venait d'être éteint, et quelques minutes plus tard, je rentrais en collision avec mon frère. - Hansel ? s'inquiéta-t-il. Hey, Alicia, j'ai trouvé mon frère ! Blondie s'approcha de nous. - Où est Éli ? Je me contentais de baisser les yeux, incapable de lui annoncer. - Non… non, non, NON ! De rage, elle frappa dans le mur le plus proche, qui se fissura sur plusieurs mètres. Bordel, mais c'est qu'elle est forte ! Je m'éloignais un peu, et elle se retourna d'un coup vers nous. La capuche tomba et dévoila son visage, empli d'inquiétude, de tristesse et de colère. - Comment ? demanda-t-elle simplement. Je relatais donc toute l'histoire et, à la fin, elle me rassura, ce qui me surprit grandement. - Ce n'est pas ta faute, affirma-t-elle. Tu n'aurais rien pu faire. Cette sorcière était apparemment très puissante, si tu étais resté, elle t'aurait eu toi aussi. Nous n'ajoutâmes rien et rentrâmes à l'auberge, où nous avions une chambre, pour nous reposer, tandis que Gretel racontait à grand renfort de gestes comment il avait éteint le feu grâce à l'aide d'Alicia. Pourtant, à peine quelques minutes après que nous nous soyons couché (elle avait une chambre à côté de la notre, nous tenions à la lui payer), j'entendis le plancher craquer de l'autre côté de notre porte, et une ombre couper le faible raie de lumière qui passe en dessous. Je me levais sans réveiller Gretel et ouvris la porte. Je vis alors Alicia en train de descendre les escaliers, un sac sur le dos. Je sautais par dessus la rambarde et lui bloquais le chemin jusqu'à la sortie. - Qu'est-ce que tu fais ? demandais-je. - Je vais chercher Éli. Si je ne suis pas de retour à la fin de la journée, vous quittez le royaume au plus vite, expliqua-t-elle en tentant de passer à côté de moi. Laisse moi sortir ! - Pas question ! C'est du suicide, tout ça ! Pourquoi tu n'attends pas demain matin ? Et pourquoi est-ce qu'on devrait quitter le royaume ? Pourquoi tu pars seule ? Elle soupira. - Si je n'attends pas, c'est parce qu'il y a un lien spécial qui nous relie, Éli et moi. Je peux… je peux ressentir tout ce qu'elle ressent, y compris sa douleur, et les sorcières le savent. - Donc c'est un piège, compris Hansel. Pourquoi te jeter dedans, dans ce cas ? - Éliane ne leur sert à rien sans moi, tout comme je ne sers à rien aux sorciers sans Éliane. C'est moi qu'elles veulent, et il est hors de question qu'Éli souffre à ma place. - Je viens avec toi. Je n'avais pas vraiment réfléchis, mais à voir l'étincelle d'espoir qui s'était allumé dans son regard, je compris que c'était la bonne chose à dire. Pourtant, elle protesta. - C'est hors de question. Si je n'arrive pas à sauver Éli et que je suis faite prisonnière moi aussi, vous serez notre dernière chance ! protesta-t-elle. J'allais répondre lorsqu'un cri retentit de ma chambre. Gretel ! Je montais quatre à quatre les escaliers et ouvrit la porte à la volée pour trouver… rien. Il n'y avait plus rien dans notre chambre, aucune trace de mon frère. J'avisais alors la fenêtre ouverte et le message de sang sur le mur. Plus que deux ! Je me retournais vers Alicia, qui venait de monter me rejoindre et qui affichait une mine horrifiée. - Elles savent que nous sommes trop puissants lorsque nous sommes en équipe, dis-je, alors elles s'en prennent à nous lorsque nous sommes seul. On ne doit plus se séparer maintenant, et je viens avec toi non seulement pour t'aider, mais aussi parce que c'est dangereux, parce qu'il faut sauver mon frère, et parce que malgré nos débuts, on pourrait être de bons amis. J'avais expliqué mes raisons tout en rassemblant mes affaires et je me retournais finalement vers elle, qui était figée sur place. Pourtant, elle se reprit bien vite et me sourit franchement. - T'es peut-être pas si con, finalement, lâcha-t-elle. - Et je suis censé le prendre comment ? - Pour moi, c'était un compliment, mais tu le prends comme tu veux, dit-elle en haussant les épaules. Aller, en route ! Mais nous n'irons pas les sauver tout de suite. - Quoi ? - Même si je connais la douleur d'Éliane et celle prochaine de Gretel, tu n'es pas prêt. Si on venait à se séparer, tu pourrais te défendre, mais les sorcières gagnent en puissance et sans magie, tu ne résisterais pas longtemps. Je vais donc t'entrainer et nous irons les libérer quand je te jugerais prêt, expliqua-t-elle. - Mais il ne reste que deux semaines avant la Lune de Sang ! répliquais-je. - Raison de plus pour que tu progresses vite. Aller, on y va, et vite ! Nous allons à Stonehenge. Sachant qu'il ne servait à rien d'argumenter, je la suivis et nous quittâmes la ville pour nous enfoncer dans la forêt, alors que les premières lueurs de l'aube éclairaient la ville.[Chapter 7] Alors salut tout le monde, je sais que ça fait un bail que je n'ai plus posté sur cette histoire, et je tenais à m'en excuser.

Pour faire court, moi et mon frère jumeau chassons des sorcières "},{"Movie":"Karate Kid","Title":"Strike Balance","Author":"AllValleyGirl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12938337","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Kreese takes it too far with Miguel, and Johnny finally admits he doesn't know how to fix things alone. Johnny's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter One: Coors Light \"Hold that there,\" Johnny demands, shoving the can of beer against Miguel's face. He clenches his teeth at the sight of the shiner. Johnny's seen a fair share of black eyes in his time, and this is gonna be a bad one. \"I don't need it.\" Miguel limply pushes away the beer, but Johnny isn't having it. He grabs his wrist, slams it down, and shoves the icy Coors Banquet against his eye again. Too exhausted to resist, Miguel curls his lip in a last-ditch attempt at defiance. Even pressed up against the wall, Johnny can see his legs shaking. It's an effort for the kid to keep standing. To be honest, Johnny's shocked Miguel is still standing. Hawk had kneed him in the dick when he was down, cawing like some cheesy-ass raptor while he did it. The asshole. Johnny shudders at the image of the five Cobras circling in on Miguel, Kreese leaning into the action, his teeth bared in a malicious grin, egging them on. Show the anchor baby who belongs here! The whole thing had been brutal. Not that Johnny hasn't thought anchor baby himself when the kid's being all annoying and stuff, but with his grandma detained by ICE and Miguel obviously freaking out about it, it's just… He doesn't know what it is. He'd saved these loser kids – taught them how to defend themselves, how to be badass. And somehow, it's exactly that badassery that's turning them against him. Which shouldn't be surprising, because that's his life, isn't it? One shitshow after the next. Kreese stole his dojo 'cause of some bullshit legal mumbo-jumbo, and now he's stealing his students. And the more Johnny tries to step in and stop the evil bastard from hurting his kids, the more it makes Johnny look like a wimp, and the less respect the kids give him. It's a goddamn nightmare. Maybe Johnny is a wimp. He suppresses the memory of thick hands around his neck, his trophy snapped at his feet, the parking lot blurring, Bobby's terrified protests blotting out as he struggled to breathe… But it isn't about him right now. It's about Miguel. With an expert strike, Johnny swipes the piles of paperwork off his desk, clearing the space in one go. \"Sit your ass down and let me take a look at your injuries.\" \"I'm fine.\" \"Fine? Have you seen yourself? You're so black I can't even tell you're Mexican.\" \"I'm Ecuadorian.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Sensei Kreese is making me stronger,\" Miguel says through clenched teeth. He hacked up a loogie and spit a dark red glob blood onto the desk. For the first time, Johnny notices his braces are gone. \"The cops would do worse. I can take whatever he gives. I'm no pussy.\" \"No, you're not.\" Johnny sighs. He needs Miguel to understand, but he has no idea what to say to him. It's rare Johnny wins a fight that isn't fought with his fists. Kreese has been targeting Miguel since day one, to make a point to Johnny. A point about who's boss. A point about how pathetic and soft Johnny actually is deep inside. Kreese hurts Miguel because he knows the boy means something to Johnny. Coors Light – Kreese's derisive nickname is proof enough it isn't about Miguel. Jesus. Maybe he is going soft. Maybe Kreese is right. He should stop worrying about protecting Miguel and let Miguel protect himself. Thing is, Miguel isn't protecting himself. What do you do when your star pupil starts saying he \"deserves\" to get beat if he's not strong enough to fight back? That he's \"lucky\" to have Kreese teach him what it takes to be a man? There's no getting through to Miguel, not after how he reacted when he found out Robby is his son. The closer Johnny gets to Robby, the worse things get between him and Miguel. \"Listen, flaco.\" It's an insult he's picked up from another Spanish-speaking student, and it seems to get Miguel's attention, because his head shoots up in surprise. \"Setting five students against one who's already injured isn't a fucking fair fight–\" \"Life doesn't give you a fair fight,\" Miguel interrupts. His voice cracks on the word fair. Johnny doesn't know if he's still going through puberty or if he's about to cry. He sure as hell hopes it's the boy's balls dropping because he has no idea what to do with a crier. \"No mercy, remember? Winning a stupid tournament against wimpy, entitled millennials is nothing compared to what's out there in the real world.\" There is an uncomfortable silence for a long time. Because what can Johnny say? Miguel is repeating back the lessons he'd taught him, only on steroids. And frankly it wouldn't be surprising if Miguel were on steroids, too. \"How's your mom holding up?\" \"How do you think she is?\" Miguel snaps. \"She's lost her mom. And she can't even make rent now that they've taken Yaya–\" He pounds his fist against the wall and let out a sharp gasp of pain. Johnny doesn't blame him; Miguel's knuckles are destroyed from training with that damn wooden mannequin. \"I can cover your rent until–\" \"I don't need your help. When I win this fight, I'll have enough to fix things. I'll pay the rent. I'll pay for a good lawyer–\" \" I'll pay for a lawyer.\" Miguel scoffs. \"Like you could. You don't even own Cobra Kai anymore. You're an employee .\" It's hard to take the look of disgust coming off a kid who once idolized him. \"Listen, Miguel. Just shut up and listen for once, okay? Whatever you need, I'll take care of it. Shit, I'll let you and your mom move in if it comes to that.\" \"You didn't even raise your own son. Stop trying to raise me.\" The little shit knows how to hit him where it hurts. He'll teach him– Miguel flinches. It's the shock of that sight that pulls Johnny back to reality. His hand is curled in a fist, raised to strike. It had been so instinctual, he hadn't even known he'd moved. He drops his hand to his side, his rage gone. Miguel was never a flincher, not even in the beginning. A flush is heating Miguel's cheeks. He's ashamed for that flash of fear. But Miguel isn't the one who should be ashamed. He isn't the full-grown man ready to beat the shit of a skinny kid who can barely stand. \"I'm sorry, sensei,\" Miguel mumbles. He hasn't called him sensei in weeks. \"I didn't mean it. I don't know why I said that.\" Before Johnny can see it coming and do something to stop it, tears are streaming down Miguel's cheeks. Miguel is finally at his breaking point. Four months of being beaten and berated by Kreese, and Johnny's the one to push him to the edge. Four months of bitter defiance and rage, and now the boy's crumbling in a heap of self-loathing and shame. He's turned the ruthlessness meant for his enemies on himself. Johnny knows those highs and lows all too well. \"I'm sorry, sensei.\" The kid is sobbing uncontrollably, and Johnny suddenly has a flashback to Robby as baby, wailing and wailing and there was nothing Johnny could do about it, no way to fix it, he was a failure as a parent– \"Quiet!\" Miguel nods in obedience, forcefully wiping the tears off his face, but he only cries harder, sucking in the air as if he were drowning. His legs buckle and the Coors falls out of his hand, but before his ass hits the floor, Johnny grabs him under his arms and pulls him up. \"I don't want you to see me like this,\" Miguel says, words mushed together, snot streaming over his bloody mouth. His forehead lolls against Johnny's shoulder. Johnny would be shocked if Miguel is back in full form in two months, he's that bad off. How had he let things go this far? Johnny sweeps Miguel's dark hair out of his eyes, trying to calm him down, even though he sucks at it. \"It's okay,\" he says lamely. \"I can't handle it anymore,\" Miguel chokes out. \"I can't. I just can't do it. I'm nothing but a pussy quitter, and I'm so messed up I'll never win the fight, and it will be all my fault when we can't get Abuela back. I need you, sensei…\" Christ. He needs another beer. No. He needs a bottle of whiskey. Beer isn't gonna cut it tonight. \"You're not a pussy,\" Johnny says. He pats his shoulder in an attempt to act fatherly. Miguel hisses in pain at the contact, but leans into it all the same. \"You're not a quitter,\" Johnny says, voice low and authoritative. \"You're smart. You know when to walk away, ya hear me? You know when to ask for help.\" \"You never need to ask for help.\" It hits him right in the gut. He should have asked for help months ago. He'd known he was in over his head but he refused to see it. And it is all his fault Miguel is crying like a wimp. It is all his fault Miguel will probably be pissing blood for a week after that jab to the kidney. None of this would have ever happened if hotshot Johnny Lawrence hadn't been too damn proud to ask for help. Kreese had been a father to him, had toughened him up and straightened him out and beat him down – he'd been the only person Johnny had never been able to defeat, even counting LaRusso, because the never-ending oneupmanship between them is different. It's equal. No fear in this dojo – that's bullshit. Whenever Kreese is around, all Johnny feels is fear. And the man knows it, no matter how hard Johnny tries to hide it. There was one person in the world who had put Kreese in his place. One person who'd stepped in and saved Johnny from being choked to death in a parking lot. A little old oriental who Johnny never even liked. And that old man is dead. Miyagi. How could he forget the name when LaRusso named his lame-ass dojo after him? Even if Johnny hates Daniel LaRusso, even if the bad blood between them will always boil, LaRusso would do what the old man would've done. He'd help Johnny. He'd stand up to Kreese. Johnny doesn't know how, but he would. That cocky, scrawny bastard always finds a way. It's the Jersey in him. Johnny has to give the guy some credit, no matter how much he hates him. Robby told him it was LaRusso who encouraged him to start hanging out with dear ol' dad again. Still…things have to be really bad to go to LaRusso for a favor. Johnny pulls Miguel off his shoulder and takes one last glance at him. At least the sobbing has stopped, but the kid is still…wet and red-nosed and bruised to a pulp and pathetic. Johnny doesn't even want to rub it in as a joke. No crude humor is gonna fix this. He props Miguel up on the desk, ensures he's stable enough to sit, and picks up the beer from the floor. He hands it over. \"On your face.\" \"It's not even cold anymore,\" Miguel protests as he takes it. \"So drink it.\" Miguel gives him a quick glance to double-check for approval, pops the tab back, and the beer comes fizzing out over the top. He jerks his neck back and chugs it. When he's done, he wipes off his mouth and gives Johnny a rueful smile. \"You need to start buying craft beer. That stuff is rank.\" \"What do you know? You're a teenager. I'm not gonna drink some girly shit nobody's ever heard of. Coors is a man's drink.\" \"And Coors Light?\" Miguel asks, bitter. His hand is on Miguel's shoulder again. It feels awkward, like a limp fish just resting there. \"Coors Light is pretty okay.\" It was the wrong thing to say, as usual, because Miguel's eyes are getting all watery again. Miguel swallows; Johnny can see the kid's Adam's apple bob up and down. \"Thanks, sensei.\" Johnny clenches his teeth. His throat is tight but it's probably just a cold or something dumb like that. Allergies or whatever. Not that he's pussy enough to get allergies. \"Come on kid, let's get you to my car.\" \"We going home?\" He's tempted to say yes. He's tempted to slink back into his apartment, quit Cobra Kai, and forget any of this ever happened. It's more enticing than the alternative. Johnny imagines LaRusso's smug face as he begs for help. He feels like a dog exposing its belly. A loser. And then he thinks of Miguel, calling him sensei. He thinks of Miguel limp in his arms after the Halloween dance, when he promised himself never to let him down again. He thinks of Robby, reining in his recklessness, finding it in himself to forgive his deadbeat dad for checking out on him. Robby, showing up on Saturdays to watch action flicks and shoot the shit. Robby, slowly, slowly learning to trust him. Miguel, who already does… He isn't going to let those boys down. \"No.\" Johnny squeezes Miguel's shoulder and helps him to his feet. \"We're not going home. We're going to fight back.\"[Chapter 2] When Johnny comes to him to ask for help with Kreese, Daniel's assumptions are challenged. Daniel's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. o - o - o - o - o Chapter Two: History Repeats Itself History repeats itself, try and you'll succeed! -You're the Best, Joe Esposito It's storming and Daniel's sitting cross-legged in the living room, relaxing with a cup of matcha. He likes the sound of the warm California rain hitting the red clay tiles of his Encino hacienda. He takes in the comfort of the tall stucco walls surrounding him, the security that his home is his , that he will provide for his kids and his wife no matter what. Not that Amanda needs providing for. That's comforting, too. It's cluttered though, in a way it wasn't five years ago. Less peaceful. They've been too busy to properly care for their home. Daniel used to clean in his free time. He liked it, washing the windows rhythmically, sweeping the wide, open wood floors in the manner Mr. Miyagi taught him. Ironic, considering how he'd complained about it as a teen. But he hasn't had a chance to clean in a long time. Or maybe he hasn't made it a priority. They hire a housekeeper twice a week, an elderly Hispanic woman who doesn't speak a lick of English. They hire out for lawn work and small household repairs. They order takeout more often than they should. It's not something he's proud of. He's actually alone for once. Amanda's picking up Anthony from a friend's house, and Sam and Robby are in the home dojo practicing. (He's not going to think too hard about what they're practicing.) It's rare he gets a quiet moment to himself these days. When he's not running the dealership or running his household, trying to bond with a son who's not interested, trying to understand a daughter who, despite being interested again, is going through all the teenage hormones and hysterics that make fatherhood impossible, when he's not trying to sneak a moment alone with Amanda, he's at the dojo, trying to save kids from an influence that should have been put to rest in 1985. With Kreese back running Cobra Kai, all his worst suspicions about Johnny have proven true. He's thought about Mr. Miyagi often lately. Maybe more often than is healthy to reflect on the past. But he's always gone back to his old mentor whenever anything in his life gets confusing. He thought he'd found stability, a sense of balance. He'd thought he'd become a good man, the type of man Mr. Miyagi would be proud of. And then Johnny Lawrence had to show up at LaRusso Auto, a ghost from his past. Or skeleton, more like. And with the slightest, immature temptation in that graffiti, Daniel had given into his old, stubborn, hotheaded ways. The same reckless self-destruction that drove a friendless, skinny kid to dump ice-cold water on his bullies unprovoked came out in a man who used his social influence to get the rent raised on a entire strip mall as a petty comeback for his childhood bully. Now that Daniel's had time to cool off, he sees it was exactly the sort of stunt he'd expect those blond, rich, Cobra Kai kids' banker daddies to pull on weekends for fun back in the '80s. Sometimes it scared him; like maybe he'd become indistinguishable from his privileged SoCal trust fund peers at the country club, like maybe there was none of the scrappy Newark Italian boy left in him. All these years, he's been so obsessed with building comfort and security for his family that he hadn't considered what could be lost. He never wanted his kids to have to up and move across the country in their formative years, or live in a broken-down apartment, or wear secondhand clothes, or grow up without a dad, or worry about getting jumped by rich kids whose wealth shelters them from consequences. And now he wonders if a little struggle and discipline would've been good for them. If Anthony would be less attached to his screen, if Sam would have been a kinder friend to Aisha. Neither of them really respect him. He doesn't have all the answers, but if there's one thing he does know, it's karate. It's the peace and contemplation found in the kata, the love between a student and his sensei, the self-worth that can be built in blocks and kicks and the knoweldge that because you can defend yourself, you might never have to. Karate is the family you create, the family that goes deeper than blood ties. He isn't going to give into his old self again. Miyagi-do is proof enough. Robby is proof enough. Daniel's given his students a haven, just like Mr. Miyagi gave him when he needed it most. Daniel blinks as headlights pierce the fog and illuminate the rain. Tires screech to a halt on his driveway – the sharp stop of anger or desperation, or both. Not now. Daniel huffs in annoyance, places his teacup on the coffee table where it rattles, and heads to the door. He cracks it open to the sight of Johnny's fist raised, ready to knock, and blanches for a second at old memories when Johnny's fist was raised for an entirely different reason. Johnny's supporting his student with his other arm – Miguel, the one who was an asshole to Daniel's little girl. But now is not the time to pull the protective father act, because the boy looks beaten within an inch of his life, his bloody shirt tied around him as a makeshift bandage, and the terror on Johnny's face sends chills down Daniel's spine. He opens the door wide and steps aside to let them in. \"We need to talk,\" Johnny says. No shit. \"Here,\" Daniel says, taking command of the situation, not even questioning why Johnny has come to him, of all people. \"Let's get him on the sofa.\" He supports the injured kid at the opposite shoulder and the two rivals assist him in surprisingly easy tandem to the other side of the room. They're helping Miguel lie down when footsteps pound in from behind. \"That's my dad's car!\" Robby's shouting between huffs of breath. \"What's going on?\" And Daniel knows exactly when they enter the room because Robby says, \"Dad?\" in a quiet, worried voice, and Sam cries, \"Oh my God, Miguel!\" Daniel and Johnny turn instinctually to their kids. Sam's hand is covering her mouth. She steps toward them but Robby puts his hand on her wrist and she hesitates. \"Is Miguel okay?\" she asks, voice pitched high with worry. \"He'll live,\" Johnny answers. \"What happened?\" Robby asks. Johnny hesitates, ashamed. \"Kreese got carried away.\" Daniel takes a deep breath. His daughter doesn't need to see this. She doesn't need to hear it. This is exactly the sort of thing he's spent the last sixteen years protecting her from. \"Sam, go up to your room.\" \"No way, dad! Look at him, we need to call an ambulance, I can't just leave him here –\" \"Listen to your dad,\" Miguel cuts in. So maybe the kid's not all bad , Daniel thinks sarcastically. \"But Miguel's hurt –\" \"Sam. go. a. way,\" Miguel growls. He's not looking at the other kids. He's looking at the ceiling. Daniel can tell he's trying to sound tough, but his voice sounds as scratchy and pained as his body looks. It's pretty obvious he was recently crying. Daniel thinks about how he would feel at that age, if Ali saw him beaten down after she'd broken up with him. It's been a long time since he was a teenager, but not so long he can't remember how it feels. \"Sweetheart, you should really go,\" Daniel says gently. Sam's teary-eyed, but she nods. \"Robby, you too.\" \"No,\" Johnny cuts in, glaring at him. For a second, Daniel had forgotten Robby was Johnny's son. That Daniel wasn't the only one who called the shots when it came to Robby. \"Robby,\" Johnny's voice drops, and it's almost pleading, \"I need you to look after Miguel while I talk to your sensei.\" And even if Daniel couldn't have guessed with everything else, the stern, respectful way Johnny says sensei is all the evidence he needs to know they're in deep shit. \"No –\" Miguel whines. \"I'm fine –\" \"Miguel, shut up.\" Daniel would never talk to one of his students so dismissively, but it gets the job done because Miguel just grumbles, \"whatever,\" and Johnny barks, \"whatever, what?\" and Miguel says, \"whatever, sensei,\" without the attitude, and maybe even a little affection. Robby's eyes shift to Daniel for approval. He won't obey his dad unless Daniel gives it the okay. Daniel nods. Daniel knows the exchange doesn't go unnoticed by Johnny. \"Let's discuss this in the home dojo,\" Daniel says, and he finds his hand on Johnny's shoulder, guiding him as the man forcefully pulls his eyes off his son and his student. o - o - o - o - o \"You got any booze back here?\" Johnny asks. Daniel gives him an incredulous look. \"No.\" Johnny's arms are crossed and his chin is tilted up. Typical macho posturing. He's not even willing to start the conversation. Daniel rolls his eyes. \"Just tell me why you're here.\" \"Why the fuck do you think I'm here?\" Johnny snaps. \"Think I'm dropping by for a goddamn tea party? Did you see that kid?\" \"What does it have to do with me?\" Daniel snaps right back. \"You know what? Never mind. I thought you'd get it, but it turns out, you care more about seeing me beg than helping a hurt kid. So have fun gloating –\" Johnny storms away but before he can reach the door Daniel grabs his arm. \"Look, Johnny, I'm sorry. I lost my cool. Okay? Something about you, man, it brings out the worst in me.\" Daniel drops his arm. Johnny clenches his teeth. \"I know the feeling.\" \"Just…\" Daniel pauses, trying to catch his breath, trying to find his calm, \"just tell me what happened.\" Johnny pulls his hand through his hair. It's still those same thick blond waves girls loved and Daniel envied back in the day. Back when he thought he'd never live up to blue-eyed, all-American rich kid, Johnny Lawerence. The perfect popular boy with the big house in Encino. It's crazy how time changes things so drastically and somehow doesn't change anything at all. \"It's Kreese, man.\" Johnny swallows. Paces the room. His anxiety is catching and Daniel feels the need to pace himself. \"I knew something like this would happen. I knew it. But I told myself if I stayed on as a teacher, I could keep the old man in check. I could look out for the kids, maybe balance his lessons. I couldn't just leave them…\" \"Johnny, what are you talking about?\" \"Did you think I actually wanted Kreese back after what he did to me? Do you think I wanted him touching my students?\" Daniel presses his lips together, uncomfortable. \"Jesus Christ, you did.\" \"What was I supposed to think?\" Daniel says, defensive. \"When you show up to Miyagi-do with him at your side to harass me and my students? When he brags about running Cobra Kai again?\" \"It wasn't like that.\" \"Then what was it like?\" Johnny makes an exasperated, violent sweep of his arms into the air, as if to shout, What do you want from me? Daniel waits. He even manages to keep from giving the man a dirty look. \"Kreese and some other douche, Silver or Gold or some shit like that, apparently own the Cobra Kai name and logo. He threatened to sue me and take the dojo by force if I didn't give him ownership. \"I built the new Cobra Kai from scratch. It wasn't even his to take. We were nothing like the old Cobra Kai. I mean, I didn't keep the bad shit. I kept the good stuff. Like the kick-ass snake. I know you'll never see it 'cause you're so damn self righteous, but my kids were being bullied, and I was teaching them to defend themselves –\" Daniel's proud of his self-restraint when he doesn't snort. Johnny's more delusional than he'd realized. Did he even see how his students acted at the tournament? They were the bullies. \"I even got a lawyer,\" Johnny says, \"and I know he's a good one 'cause he's a Jew–\" Daniel decides not to comment. \"– and he said even if I changed the name I didn't have a leg to stand on.\" Johnny pauses and gives him a smug look. \"No pun intended.\" Daniel thinks of Kreese and sweep the leg and he does snort this time around. Johnny crosses his arms again. \"The point is, Kreese left me with no choice. Either I sign over Cobra Kai and continue as an employee, or he takes the dojo. I couldn't just leave the kids to him, now could I?\" \"Jesus,\" Daniel says. It warrants more than that, but it's so overwhelming there's nothing else to say. As usual, he'd been so blind. And Johnny was right. He had a self-righteous streak, he knew he did, but he could never stop himself in the midst of a crusade. He'd been so pissed at Cobra Kai's unsportsmanlike behavior at the tournament, so disgusted about the way Johnny egged his kids into brutalizing his own son, that Daniel hadn't even paused to consider how strange it was that Johnny would let Kreese back into his life. He'd assumed the worst and looked for nothing but confirmation. And it was just like Kreese to use some slimy, back-handed way of getting what he wanted. Kreese didn't need punches and kicks to take someone down. He liked to do it psychologically just as well. The man was a psycho. This was Silver manipulating Daniel away from the guidance of Mr. Miyagi all over again. Only this time, Miguel and the other kids were victims. And Johnny, like Mr. Miyagi, could do nothing but stand by and watch. Hope confusion end soon, Daniel-san. Miyagi heart empty without you. Daniel feels sick to his stomach. Johnny's a jerk, and Daniel won't ever agree with his teaching methods, but no one deserves that. \"So he beat up your favorite student,\" Daniel says quietly. \"Just to rub it in.\" \"Worse.\" Johnny pauses. \"He instigated my other students into doing his dirty work.\" \"Jesus,\" Daniel repeats. He crosses his arms over his stomach, doing nothing to hide his revulsion. He doesn't want to imagine it, but it's easy. It's easy because he's been there. \"Miguel, man –\" Johnny's breath catches and it sounds like he's going to cry. Maybe Daniel should have gotten him that drink. Then again, he's not going to enable an addict now he knows the man's an alcoholic. \"I know you only think of Miguel as the tough guy at the tournament, and I get it, he was ruthless. I should have taught him you fight different on the mat than on street. I know that now, okay? But I was so focused on helping him kick his bullies' asses, because that's what he needed. He's, he's…you should've seen him when he first came to me. A skinny little virgin dweeb. A complete dork, all worried about asthma and political correctness and shit. Your typical wimp.\" There's so much wrong with everything Johnny's saying, but despite that, Daniel can get to the heart beneath Johnny's words, that coil of affection he won't fully express. He cares about Miguel. And frankly, it's kind of shocking to discover Johnny's version of Miguel: a bullied underdog with a heart of gold. All this time, Daniel had only ever envisioned the Miguel of the tournament: a jerk with too much power who fought dirty. \"I taught him how to stand up for himself. I taught him not to take anybody's shit. I taught him to be a man. And Kreese had to come along and undermine everything. Reinforcing the harshest shit meant only for extreme situations, tearing Miguel down, turning my students against each other. Man, you should see Hawk. He's unrecognizable. And not that in that cool, alpha way anymore. He's a monster. \"Kreese screwed with Miguel so badly that he'd take any abuse just to prove himself. It makes me sick, man. Sick. You saw what he looks like.\" Johnny gestures sharply to the door. \"That's what it took to knock some sense into him. That's how far it had to go before Miguel accepted my help.\" \"It went pretty damn far for me, too,\" Daniel admits. \"What are you talking about?\" This time, it's Johnny who asks. o - o - o - o - o They're sitting side by side on the floor of his home dojo. Daniel's crosslegged with his elbows resting on his knees, as if his meditative pose could make the situation any better. He feels the start of a migraine pulsing at his temples. He's drained. He's just opened up to Johnny about the darkest period in his life, told his supposed enemy things he's never told anyone but Amanda. His shoulders are tense and he tries to keep a sharp awareness of his breath and body, anything to distract himself from how vulnerable he feels. They're quiet for a long time, until Johnny says, \"I'm sorry that happened to you, man. That's screwed up.\" \"I'm sorry it's happening to you.\" \"Yeah,\" Johnny says. And he sounds defeated. \"Look, I don't even know why I came to you. This isn't your problem –\" \"Oh yeah it is,\" Daniel interrupts. \"Why do you think I opened Miyagi-do? I'm not going to let Cobra Kai take over the Valley ever again. I'm glad you came to me.\" \"There was nothing wrong with Cobra Kai when it was mine,\" Johnny cuts in, ready for a fight. Daniel lets that one slide, and they slip back into almost companionable quiet. \"So what are we gonna do?\" Johnny asks eventually. \"I mean, I'd've beaten up him up already if that would solve the problem – he's old, I can take him – but he's brought the law into things like a pansy. And he's turned the kids against me. The ones who are left, at least.\" Across the room, from a framed black-and-white photograph, Mr. Miyagi gazes down on them, proud and wise. Daniel stares at the image, longing for the days when all he had to do was turn to him to find his way. Now, he has to search within himself. There's no one there to tell him right from wrong and it's hard. It's damn hard. \"What if you quit Cobra Kai and worked with me?\" It's quiet, uncertain. Johnny stares at him. A little annoyed, not comprehending. \"I mean, I know a lot about cars. And yeah, it'd be better than being unemployed, but I can't just leave the kids to Kreese. The man tried to kill me and he could've gotten Miguel killed tonight. What kind of monster do you think I am?\" \"No. I don't mean at the autoshop. I mean at Miyagi-do.\" Johnny's stare widens, and Daniel rushes in, talking too fast as his crazy idea forms more quickly than his words. \"I'm spread too thin as it is, trying to run LaRusso Auto and the dojo at the same time. With you at my side, we could teach more kids, more classes. You'd be doing me a favor. And you could talk to your students, bring them over to a place where Kreese has no influence. If it comes down to it, I'll get a restraining order so he can't get anywhere near the dojo.\" \"I don't know, man…\" But Daniel can hear Johnny's resistance waning already. He likes the idea. Weirdly enough, it's starting to grow on Daniel, too. \"It'd be great. Think about it,\" Daniel says in his best car salesman voice. \"I only have eight students. I can't take on more with my other responsibilities. You'll bring in a lot more students, I own the property and pay the bills, and we can split profit fifty-fifty. Sounds fair, yeah? I'll focus my training on kata, meditation, and conditioning, and you can work with the kids on advanced defense and combat techniques.\" Daniel shrugs. \"I like the slower stuff anyway. More my style.\" Johnny gives him a smug look. Daniel knows he's using all his self restraint from blurting out bitch or pansy or some other emasculating insult. \"Let's just get one thing straight, though,\" Daniel adds. \"I knew there was a catch.\" \"None of this strike first, strike hard, no mercy crap.\" Johnny opens his mouth to interrupt and Daniel holds out a hand for silence. \"No. At Miyagi-do, we follow the philosophy of Mr. Miyagi. And that means fighting is only ever a last resort. It is only ever used as self-defense. We don't strike first. Our karate is a way of life. It's not some flashy sport that we show off at tournaments to win a plastic trophy.\" \"Yeah, it's a gimmick you use to sell cars.\" Daniel reddens at that and his chest tightens. \"It's not a gimmick,\" he says through clenched teeth. \"Sure looks like a gimmick. And you're gonna have trouble keeping students if you don't take them to tournaments and demonstrations,\" Johnny pushes. \"Boys need an outlet for their aggression. And parents want to see what they're paying for. They want real results.\" Daniel huffs. \"I'll think about tournaments. So long as you stick to the principle of self-defense. We don't strike first.\" \"Fine. Whatever.\" Johnny's not happy about it, but he at least agrees to it. \"But don't expect me to use your pussy, pushover methods with my students.\" \"Our students,\" Daniel says. \"Our students,\" Johnny agrees. \"And my methods aren't pussy.\" \"They're absolutely pussy. Shit man, you need to lay down the law. Do you see how your own children talk back to you? They've got no respect.\" Daniel clenches his teeth, biting back a retort. He knows he's largely angry because Johnny has a point, even if he's doing a crude job of making it. Daniel lets Sam and Anthony walk all over him. But he's not going to take parenting advice from a dad who abandoned his son. Or at least he's not going to admit to considering it. \"I was pretty impressed with the respect Miguel showed you back there in the living room,\" he says begrudgingly. \"But that language. You're gonna have to work on it. You can't curse in the dojo. I don't like the sexism, either. That doesn't fly with kids these days. They're smarter than we were.\" \"I'm not one for censorship.\" Daniel rolls his eyes. He hops to his feet, swipes off the front of his trousers. \"You're not one for filters, more like.\" Johnny jumps up too and smirks. \"Maybe.\" Daniel holds out his hand. \"We got a deal, Sensei Lawrence?\" Johnny takes it and gives it a rough shake. \"Deal, Sensei LaRusso.\" They stare at each other for a moment, hands still clasped together, and Johnny's face splits into a grin. Daniel's does, too. \"We're gonna take that bastard down,\" Johnny says. \"He's never gonna hurt another kid in the Valley as long as we're alive.\" \"Damn right.\" Johnny gives him a rough, approving pat on the back. As Johnny walks out the door, Daniel shakes his head, astonished with himself. Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso, working together after all this time, after thirty-five years of grief between them. Maybe it's the worst idea he's ever had, but somehow it feels right. o - o - o - o - o TBC. If you liked reading, please review! Constructive criticism is also welcome. The next chapter is coming Wednesday! Note: I've made minor edits to the previous chapter. (Tense changes and added italics where formatting removed them.)[Chapter 3] While Daniel and Johnny discuss the situation with Kreese, Robby is left alone with an injured Miguel. Robby's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter Three: The Enemy of My Enemy Robby paces the floor, practicing his breathing exercises as he tries not to look in Miguel's direction. He'd give anything to be hidden away with Sam in her room right now, but of course his dad had to go and ask him for a favor. And as much as he doesn't care about Miguel, or what his dad wants from him, Robby's staying largely because Mr. LaRusso gave him the go-ahead. So now Robby's stuck looking after the jerk. In with your nose. Out with your mouth. In with your nose. Out with your mouth. Yeah, that's not gonna cut it right now. Robby's eyes shift to Miguel on the sofa, who smells like cheap beer and blood. He looks worse than he smells. There's a split second of satisfaction in seeing his cutthroat rival defeated. Robby has to admit it feels good to see how much better shape he's in – Miguel's way scrawnier than he'd looked in his gi at the All Valley. But that second is short, because Miguel shifts and just beneath those visible ribs is a black and blue expanse across his lower back, right at the kidneys. Robby winces. The eye and ribs look bad enough, but that, well, that probably deserves a hospital visit. Yeah, Miguel's a bully who drunkenly hit Sam, snapped his arm, targeted his injured shoulder, and nearly disabled him all to win a local kid's karate tournament, but Robby wouldn't wish this on his worst enemy. Which, all things considered, Miguel probably is. \"Need anything?\" Robby asks uncomfortably. Miguel somehow manages to glare fairly threateningly despite the fact his eye is swollen shut. \"Not from you.\" \"Right.\" Robby huffs in frustration and leaves the room. He comes back with Advil and three frozen vegan meals that he's wrapped in hand towels (Amanda's a real health nut even if she never cooks), and hands the meals over. Miguel nods without saying thank you. He presses one to his face, one to his lower back, and one to his crotch. Robby grimaces at that last one as Miguel lets out a deep sigh of relief. He props himself up on the arm rest of the sofa near Miguel's feet and hunches his shoulders, trying to figure out what to say. He wonders what his dad is telling Mr. LaRusso right now. Miguel is shifting around, and Robby is very deliberately not looking at him. It turns out he doesn't have to say anything because Miguel speaks first. \"Your phone.\" \"What?\" \"Can I borrow your phone?\" he asks through clenched teeth. \"I must've left mine at the dojo.\" Robby nods. He opens the screen with his touch ID and tosses the phone to Miguel, who catches it one hand. No way he's giving out his password. He's been involved in too many cons to make a dumb move like that. \"Mama,\" Miguel says, and slips into Spanish. Robby took up to Spanish Three before dropping out, but he can't make out much of the conversation, Miguel's speaking so fast. He hears sensei and dormir (sleep, a word he knows) and assumes he must be telling her he's staying the night at his dad's. Robby tells himself he doesn't care how often Miguel stays at his dad's but that' a lie. His dad always managed to forget the weekends he had custody. Miguel's voice is sweet and affectionate. He's forcing himself to sound cheery despite his miserable condition, and even though he's talking to his mom, Robby didn't expect him to sound so…nice. Miguel hangs up with a te amo and tosses back the phone, grimacing at even that little bit of motion. Robby must be staring because Miguel narrows his eyes at him. Or eye. \"What? I don't want her to worry.\" And that's another thing Miguel's got that he hasn't. Robby's mom wouldn't notice if he went missing for a week. He feels a flash of guilt for even thinking that, because at least she's nice when she is around. But it's true. Miguel stares up at the ceiling and Robby stares down at his hightops. \"So what happened?\" Miguel shrugs. \"You heard. Kreese set the other Cobras on me after I twisted my ankle. There's not much more to it than that.\" \"That's messed up.\" \"It was supposed to teach me a lesson about fighting in the real world.\" He sounds defeated. \"Some lesson,\" Robby scoffs. \"A lesson in what an abusive asshole Kreese is, more like it. I can't believe my dad let him do that to you.\" Actually, that's a lie too. It was just like his dad not to step up when someone relied on him. He couldn't handle having a kid, so he just noped out when Robby needed him most. He let Robby's mom take him without a fight. Robby can't count the number of promises he's broken, the number of times he's looked for him in a crowd before he gave up. His dad's missed soccer games, his 8th grade graduation, the photo session before freshman formal… Whenever the man did bother to show up, he'd act like a buddy-buddy punch on the shoulder made up for all the times he'd ignored him. It's not surprising that now that he's found some replacement kid, he's failed him, too. Even if his dad is finally trying, one day, he'll stop caring about him again. Robby wishes he could be like that – just stop caring whenever he wanted to. But no matter what his dad does, he still loves him. It doesn't make sense. They don't have anything in common. His dad's idea of \"bonding\" is drinking shitty beer and watching action movies that were corny when they were released thirty years ago. The man's a macho, deadbeat loser stuck in the '80s, who still thinks nothing tops a Farah Fawcett haircut and it's totally okay to use black as a noun. And still, Robby hates Miguel for replacing him. Miguel glowers. \"Leave Sensei Lawrence out of it. He's been trying to get me to see straight for weeks, only I wasn't listening.\" He pauses, uncomfortable. \"I thought Kreese was toughening me up, but it turns out, he's just kind of a messed up person.\" Robby remembers Mr. LaRusso's words from the tournament. There is no such thing as a bad student. Only a bad teacher. And your father had the worst… He hadn't been exaggerating. Robby can see for himself what a horrible influence that man is. Four days ago, when Robby'd stopped by, he was stuck cleaning up vomit off his dad's toilet bowl and putting the old man to bed. Robby wonders, not for the first time, what would have happened if his dad had been taken under Mr. Miyagi's wing instead of Kreese's. Robby thinks about how he's changed this past year under Mr. LaRusso's tutelage. He used to be so angry all the time. So angry that he couldn't think straight, like nothing else existed but his rage. All he cared about was getting back at his dad. In retrospect, even hanging out with those thugs and dropping out of school and stealing was some convoluted attempt at getting back at his dad. But it never worked. Afterwards, he'd felt empty and guilty, and it never gave him the satisfaction he'd been hoping for. Robby hadn't even known he'd been walking around with so much hate inside until he discovered moments where it was gone, where its absence literally changed his body. The tension he constantly held in his gut eased up, and he realized he was always getting cavities because he had a habit of grinding his teeth when he was overwhelmed. He wouldn't have recognized his own stress if Mr. LaRusso hadn't taught him to clear his mind. Mr. LaRusso had taught him to understand things he'd never noticed before. Hippie stuff, like listening to the sound of the songbirds and taking in the scent of the trees and finding a place of quiet when everything around you was stressing you out and pressing you in. Maybe it was cheesy, but it worked. His dad sure as hell could use some of that zen, but he was too much of a dick to give it credence. \"His methods are obviously unhelpful.\" Miguel gestures to his injuries. \"Not that I couldn't take it.\" \"I couldn't take it,\" Robby admits with a shrug. He doesn't need to prove anything to Miguel. The corner of Miguel's lip curls up in a cocky grin. Robby doesn't know what Sam saw in him, or that asshole Kyler, either. Miguel's back to wincing in a second, though. Robby uncaps the bottle of Advil he'd forgotten on the coffee table and hands Miguel six. \"Thanks.\" And for a moment Robby's pleasantly surprised until – \"But don't think this settles things between us. You stole my girl.\" \"Yeah, well, you stole my dad.\" It comes out before he can stop it. He hates how immature he sounds, and he knows better. Robby used to think balance was about evening the score. It's not. It's about finding peace inside yourself despite the score. But just because Robby knows better now, doesn't mean it's easy to change old habits. \"I didn't even know he had a kid. You and sensei – that has nothing to do with me. I'm not exactly happy about the situation, either.\" It was a fair point. He can admit what Miguel is saying is rational, but his feelings are anything but. So Robby changes the subject. \"Just so you know, Sam never cheated on you.\" \"Sure.\" Miguel practically snarls. \"That's why she ghosted me and showed up to the party holding your hand. She was too ashamed of me to even tell her dad we were dating. And she didn't even let me apologize for accidentally hitting her. Which was an accident ,\" he emphasizes, as if Robby were about to argue. \"She didn't text you for one day because she was grounded. And she felt guilty about not telling her family about you. She was about to apologize for that, but you never let her. \"The handholding, though, that was my doing. You're right. I was moving in on your girl. I told myself I was just being friendly when I knew I wasn't, and Sam was naive about it. That's on me.\" \"Damn right it's on you. But I guess you got what you wanted, didn't you? You guys have been kissing all over instagram for months. Don't think I don't know.\" Robby rolls his eyes. There was one instagram kiss. And it was on the cheek. He's liked Sam since the moment he saw her. There's an innocence about her – a girl who's never had to worry about being evicted, or whether her dad will remember her birthday, or what kind of man her mom's coming home with that night. Sam's lived the sort of existence that Robby didn't even dream about, didn't think existed outside of dated sitcoms: loving, involved parents; a huge, comfy house; great grades; beautiful; funny and soft… He thinks somehow her sweet smiles and corny jokes can wash away the grime of his past. It's not even about Sam. He likes Sam, sure. But it's about more than Sam. It's about being a part of the LaRusso family. Miguel snaps him back to the present. \"Whatever, it doesn't matter anymore. I've got bigger fish to fry.\" \"Looks like we all do,\" Robby says with a sigh. \"Kreese has nothing to do with you.\" \"Um…he basically abused my dad and tried to kill him when he was our age. He stole my dad's dojo and bullied his students. Yeah, nothing to do with me at all.\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"No, I don't. Are you saying what happens to my dad shouldn't matter to me?\" \"I'm saying you're not the one lying on your enemy's sofa beaten half to death.\" \"You're not my enemy.\" He realizes its true the moment he says it. His anger toward Miguel is hard to let go. He tries when he prunes the bonsais, and sometimes it works. But it flares too, when his dad only mentions the boy's name. But enemy? This isn't The Terminator. They're suburban sports rivals. He's thought enemy before, but he knows deep down it's more nuanced than that. He wishes he hadn't had to see Miguel like this, broken physically and emotionally. He wishes he never had to hear him saying sweet things to his mom over the phone. He wishes Miguel would stay the ruthless bad guy at the tournament. Some vague, bullying figure in the background of his life that enough karate training could defeat. It would be so much easier if Miguel were just a villain. Hell, it would be easier if his dad were just a villain. If life were that black and white, he wouldn't have to forgive, or empathize, or examine his part in things. But you can be a villain and a victim and a victor all at the same time. The All Valley Tournament proved that much to him last spring. He sighs. \"I doubt Mr. LaRusso will even let us get involved. He'll probably want to handle this himself. He gets pretty protective.\" \"Fuck that noise.\" Miguel sits up sharply. He groans, but he doesn't lie back down. There's a vigor in him that Robby respects. \"No one's keeping me from the fight,\" Miguel says, words muffled because his teeth are clenched in pain. \"I've been so stupid to fall for Kreese's shit, but I'm done with it. We're going to give the old man what he deserves, and I'm going to be right at Sensei Lawrence's side.\" Miguel makes a fist when he speaks, and he speaks forcefully. Even Robby feels empowered by it. \"Well, if you think I'm going to let Mr. LaRusso keep me out of the action,\" Robby says, \"you're wrong about that. I'm right there with you. This is my fight too. We have to have my dad's back.\" \"Don't worry, I do.\" \"Me too.\" There's a tense moment between them, and Robby can feel their rivalry shift into something almost like teamwork. You don't have to like the members of your team. You don't have to be friends. You just have to respect them. Trust them. He can't trust Miguel as far as he can throw him, but he can trust him with his dad. \"Look,\" says Robby, handing him an olive branch, \"I'll keep you informed of anything I find out. We can't go about this blindly. We need to do this the right way.\" Miguel nods, sharp and decisive. \"All right. Same for me. I'll give you my number. I suppose I can admit you're not entirely evil,\" he adds dryly to ease the tension. Even if Robby can tell he's half serious. \"Thanks for the ringing endorsement.\" Miguel snorts and it turns into a laugh. Robby laughs too. He starts texting Miguel's number with, Hey, it's your mortal enemy Robby. What's up? Even though it's not true anymore, if it ever was. He still doesn't like the bastard, though. o - o - o - o - o TBC. If you enjoyed the read, please review! Constructive criticism is also welcome. Chapter Four, Empty Hands (Miguel's POV), is coming out next Wednesday![Chapter 4] Miguel finds out the truth about his father. Miguel's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter Four: Empty Hands In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things: fish and karate. Karate come from China, sixteenth century, called te, \"hand.\" Hundred year later, Miyagi ancestor bring to Okinawa, call karate, \"empty hand.\" - Mr. Miyagi, The Karate Kid The comforting scent of arroz con pollo and sweet plantains is thickening in the kitchen, and so is the smoke. Miguel quickly takes the pan off the stovetop before he burns the plantains and ruins dinner. It smells good, but not as good as his Yaya makes it. He's not sure he's even made it right. She never taught him exactly, but he's spent enough evenings hanging out with her in the kitchen that he picked it up naturally. Miguel paces the floor a few times as the dish cools down. On second thought, no matter how delicious the smell, he starts regretting his decision to cook dinner. It reminds him of her, and even that reminder tightens his chest, but he won't let himself cry. He needs her, but right now, she needs him. Wherever she is, locked in that detention center, she needs him to be a man and hold it together. She needs him to take care of his mama. He's going to make her proud of how he managed things when she gets home. He still can't believe it happened. It feels more like a nightmare than reality. Someone had called the police and tipped them off that Yaya was selling drugs. His Yaya. A drug dealer. Of all things. How can people be so ignorant? Just because they're Latino doesn't mean they're gangbangers or dealers. They're just normal people. But apparently, the police can be so ignorant, because they showed up at the bakery, humiliating her in front of her coworkers, and found two ounces of marijuana in her purse. Just the little bit she smokes at night to help relax and fall asleep. And they didn't let her go like any reasonable person would. They came back to their house while he was at school with their dogs and warrant and found nothing, leaving everything a mess. They've questioned his mom four times now. Miguel's heard horror stories, but he still can't believe it's happening to him, to his family. And none of it makes sense. He's done a ton of research online, and even with Trump's insane rhetoric and border enforcement tightening up like crazy, a law-abiding, tax-paying, little old granny who's lived here for seventeen years without even a traffic violation should definitely have been given bail bond. Apparently, it can take years and years for the courts to process the case. She should be with him right now. There's something he's not being told, and he knows it. He sure as hell could use her support right now. She's the one who had his back when he began karate. Yaya, she believed in him. Believes. He's not going to think about her in past tense. Not ever. His mom, he loves her more than life, but she's so overprotective it's stifling. Working as an ICU nurse is a daily reminder that bodies break and life ends, and Miguel can always tell the days she's lost a patient, even if she doesn't say anything. When she gets a look at his face she's going to flip. He's managed to avoid her for three days now with excuses about training and schoolwork and sleepovers. She's been working extra shifts to make up for Yaya's income, so it hasn't been difficult. They haven't seen enough of each other lately. Not with his mom overstretched at work, wrapped up in talking to immigration lawyers every spare second, and spending her Sundays at church again (even though she never went with Yaya) as a last, desperate attempt to convince God to fix this. Not with Miguel getting sucked into Kreese's all-consuming bullshit, becoming so obsessed with \"defeating his enemies\" and \"learning how to take a punch\" as a way to forget about Yaya. As a way to feel less powerless. He's had three days to think about it, and he can't believe how stupid he was, how unthinkingly he let Kreese mold him, how easily he gave up on Sensei when the man was no longer top dog. He's ashamed of himself. Yesterday, when Miguel tried to apologize again, Sensei said he wasn't going to take any of that \"regret and guilt bullshit\" and it was water under the bridge. And then he gave him a side-hug, which was nice, and a noogie, which wasn't. Sort of. Miguel starts setting the table, laying out only two plates, and even that sends a lump of regret in his throat. Behind him, the lock clicks and the door rattles open. \"Oh, Miggy, you've made dinner–\" And he turns around to face her. And face her reaction. o - o - o - o - o \"Mom, Mom, come on!\" He's chasing her out the door and she's cussing in Spanish, in a low, terrifying voice. She's not even listening to him. \"Mom! I'm fine! Seriously, I'm fine!\" Miguel touches her shoulder, trying to calm her down, but she shrugs him off sharply and beelines for Sensei's door. Before he can stop her, she's pounding on it, with not even just her fist, but her whole forearm. She's a small woman, but she's putting so much force into that knock that the silver hoops in her ears are swinging back and forth and the curls in her ponytail are smacking her eyes. It's a war drum. Miguel clasps his hands together behind his head, arches his neck, and groans. \"Come on, Mom,\" he whines. \"It's not his fault.\" Sensei's even braver than Miguel ever guessed because he actually opens the door. He's barefoot, wearing gray sweatpants (the retro kind that have elastic at the ankles). He hasn't shaved, and his white t-shirt looks stained with sweat and beer. Great. Just great. \"Carmen, I know, I'm sorry–\" She shoves Sensei's chest. He doesn't block, he doesn't use any of the defense he's drilled so ruthlessly into Miguel. He just holds out his hands in a helpless, wordless apology. She grits her teeth and slaps him right across the face. Miguel cringes. \"I deserved that,\" Sensei says. \"You're damn right.\" She shakes her head. \"Not only did you get him beat up again, but you had my son keeping it from me, lying to me–\" \"Mom, that wasn't Sensei's fault!\" Miguel shouts. They both turn to him. He takes a deep breath. \"Sensei Lawrence had no idea I was avoiding you. I just, I didn't want you to be upset, okay?\" \"No, Miguel,\" his mom says, her voice quivering with anger. \"It's not okay. We don't keep secrets in our house. You know that.\" Miguel crosses his arms and narrows his eyes. \"Do you?\" \"What are you talking about?\" He bites down on his lower lip and drops his eyes. He's not sure he has the courage to confront her. He's not sure he can handle the truth, whatever it is. He clears his throat and speaks to the gravel. \"I know you're not telling the truth about what's going on with Yaya.\" His mom and Sensei exchange a look. Like they know something he doesn't. He feels the betrayal like a punch to the gut. \"I'm trying to protect you, Miggy,\" his mom says. \"I told you you should tell him,\" Sensei says with a sigh. She points at him accusingly. \"You stay out of this.\" Sensei pulls a hand through his hair and nods. \"Do you want to come in?\" He opens the door and with one last, sour look, his mom shoves back his teacher. Miguel follows them both inside. o - o - o - o - o They're settled on Sensei's sofa, his mom and Sensei. Sensei's pressing out a migraine in his temples. His mom's back is straight and defensive, not at all like she normally sits. Miguel's propped up against the TV stand, facing them, one knee tucked up against his chest, his palms digging into the edge of the wood. \"Miggy,\" his mom starts, hesitating, and then jumps right into it, \"the reason why they aren't posting Yaya's bond is because they think we're associated with bad people. They're holding her because they want information.\" \"What?\" he asks, incredulous. \"We don't even know any bad people.\" He tightens his hand into a fist. \"Why would they even think that of us? You're a nurse. Yaya's a pastry chef.\" He sees his mom and sensei exchange that look again, and his rage turns into dread. \"We don't, do we? We're not involved with any bad people.\" He's not sure if it comes out as more of a statement or a question, but his voice is breaking and he wishes he had his growth spurt earlier so he could stop sounding like a middle school loser. \"Mom, is someone threatening you?\" he asks quickly in Spanish. He didn't mean to exclude Sensei, it came out automatically. He's been bilingual since he first learned to speak, but Spanish is more comfortable, more real to him somehow. English is friends and school and the outside world. Spanish is home. He rarely dreams in English. His mom shakes her head, and her eyes are brimming with tears. \"No one's threatening me, Miggy,\" she answers in English. \"We're safe. There's no one out to hurt us, but I've…I've kept some things from you. About why we left Ecuador.\" \"You left because there weren't any jobs. You left because you wanted me to get a good education– \" \"Yes, yes, I did. I do,\" his mom says, too fast. \"But there's more.\" Miguel tightens his grip against the edge of the stand. He feels pressure against his palms, and pushes deeper against it. \"Your father… I was very young. Eighteen. A teenager. I was in love with him, and everything happened so quickly. And when I found out the truth about his job, when I found out what kind of person he was, I knew I had to leave, for our safety…\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Your dad's a drug lord, kid.\" His mom looks about ready to slap Sensei again, but Miguel's grateful for the blunt truth. Even if he's sick to his stomach. \"He wasn't a drug lord back then. He was a runner. He was new to the lifestyle. When I found out, he told me it was temporary. But I knew he was just telling me what I wanted to hear, and I wasn't going to let my baby grow up like that. I loved him, but I loved you more, Miggy. Even before you were born. And I wasn't going to put you at risk. Your father was dangerous. \"I didn't look back. The only thing I cared about was making a new life for you, protecting you. I've had no contact with your father since we left Ecuador. I didn't know if he was dead or alive until the police took your abuela and started questioning me.\" She shakes her head, furious. \"Apparently he's moved up in the world. Enough to be on the government's radar, enough that his crimes follow this family all the way to Reseda. We don't have anything to do with him, but the police don't care. I don't even know how they found out about us, but they're desperate for information. They think they can blackmail me into talking by detaining your abuela. But I have nothing to say. I've told them everything I know.\" Miguel is quiet. So quiet he can hear the blood rushing in his ears, his heart thumping in his chest. It's too much to take in. Whenever he'd asked about his dad, his mom had told him the same story: that he'd been too young and immature to be a father at the time. That her best chance of giving her baby a good life was coming to America. It was a common enough story. Plenty of kids have deadbeat dads. Even Sensei abandoned his kid for a while. Miguel's not even angry at her for lying. He just feels hollow. \"Do I look like him?\" He doesn't know why it's the first thought that comes out. His mom covers her mouth, trying to keep back tears. \"Miggy…\" \"Do I, do I remind you of him? Do you think I'm like him?\" And now it all makes sense. Why she was so overprotective all these years. Why she never wanted him to do karate. Why she was so strict about non-violence. Why she babied him. She knew he'd do exactly what he did do if given the chance: turn self-defense into sadism, let his aggression take control. She knew because it's in his blood. \"No sweetie, not at all.\" But he's not sure he can believe her. \"Miggy…\" his mom tries. \"I do, don't I?\" \"Jesus, Miguel,\" Sensei interrupts. \"What are you, a girl? Stop turning this into a soap opera. You're too much of a dork to ever end up like that. You're more of a Duckie than a drug lord. Look at yourself.\" For some reason, Miguel feels a little relief. He doesn't believe them 100%, but he believes them more than he did a second ago. \"What's a Duckie?\" \" Pretty in Pink? No? Not ringing a bell? Oh my God. I know the title's lame, but it's a classic. Pro tip – it's the perfect date night movie.\" Sensei turns to his mom. \"Kids these days know nothing.\" And it almost brings a smile to her face. o - o - o - o - o They go back to the Diaz house because Sensei doesn't have Netflix or Amazon or any other streaming service. (Or even know what a streaming service is.) The three of them watch Pretty in Pink and eat Miguel's home-cooked meal in front of the TV. Sensei cracks his bananas joke again and his mom rolls her eyes, but Miguel can tells she finds it endearing. His mom is sitting next to Sensei on the sofa, and Miguel's on his knees on the floor with a bowl of popcorn. When he gets up to go to the bathroom, Sensei's hand is resting protectively on his mom's knee and they're sitting close. Closer than friends. He pretends he doesn't notice, but he feels his face flush. And despite his embarrassment, he's happy about it. o - o - o - o - o It's hard to fall asleep. He's stirring and turning and the AC's not working, so his sheets are sticking to his legs. He feels stupid for that fleeting moment of hope. He can't get ahead of himself, wanting things that won't ever be. Real men don't date women with kids. They don't raise other men's children. It's too much baggage. Too much work. In the past, boyfriends have dropped his mom because of him. She's never said it, but he knows it. And Sensei didn't want to be Robby's dad, and Robby's his own flesh and blood. So Miguel's sure as hell not arrogant enough to imagine Sensei would want to be his dad. He's only another student, even if they are close. Actually, he's lying to himself. He is imagining it. Which only makes it harder to accept a happy ending like that won't ever happen. He squeezes his eyes shut, tries to force himself to fall asleep, but of course that doesn't work. He feels more alone than ever. He wishes he could sneak back into his mom's room like he used to when he was little. When she would soothe away the nightmares and rock him to sleep. He wishes he could find Yaya on the porch, take in the stale smell of her late-night joint, listen to the stories about when she was a little girl, or her snarky remarks about the bakery customers. He wishes he could find an excuse to go knock on Sensei's door so he wouldn't have to be alone. His abuela's gone, and he has no idea when or if he'll get her back. He has no idea how she's being treated. What if they don't let her take her blood pressure medication? What if her bed is uncomfortable? What if she doesn't have privacy? He's disappointed himself and disappointed Sensei for not standing up to Kreese all these months. And he can't get that damn old man's words out of his head. Wimp. Pussy. Weakling. Bitch. Girl. And now he knows that every time his mom looks at him, deep down she's looking at the mirror image of the evil, drug-dealing murderer she ran away from all those years ago. He knows she's looking at the kind of person he could grow up to be. He'd lost Sam because he let his aggression take control. She saw the truth about him before he could see it himself. He curls his knees up tight against his chest and tries to will it all away. He wonders if there's ever a middle, a place between being a pussy and a monster. A way to be normal again. He doesn't want to go back to who he was before he meant Sensei Lawrence, but he can't handle feeling like this either, like he has to be on top or he's nothing. For a moment there last spring, it felt like he had the whole world in his hands. He had Sam. He had his mom and abuela at his back, cheering him on, rooting for him. He was so close to Sensei, who'd given him everything – his confidence, his strength, his friends. It's probably completely idiotic, and it's too late to change how he feels, but he's pretty sure he loves him. Not that he'd ever tell him. Sensei would call him a homo or something. He's only ever loved his mom and Yaya before and he really, really hates himself for being so stupid. Everything is slipping away, and he doesn't trust the things that are left. He doesn't trust that he deserves them. He doesn't trust they won't be taken away from him, too. o - o - o - o - o Thank you for reading! Please leave me a comment to let me know what you think. Next week's chapter, \"No Such Thing as Free Lunch,\" is coming Wednesday, June 13th. Sam's POV.[Chapter 5] Roundhouse kicks and weaponized lunch trays aren't the only way to take down bullies in the cafeteria. Sam's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter Five: No Such Thing as Free Lunch Sam sifts her fork through oil and vinegar, wrinkling her nose at soggy gray iceberg lettuce and tomatoes so freezer-burnt they're discolored white. She takes a bite and regrets her meal choice. At least with the sloppy Joes, you have the beauty of not knowing what you're eating. When she was little, her mom had wanted to put her in private school, and while Sam's glad her dad insisted she go to West Valley like a normal kid, she can't help but think her mom had a point about the food. \"Sam, you don't need to lose any weight,\" Aisha says bluntly. She jabs her fork into a chicken nugget, takes a bite, makes a face, and puts the rest of the nugget back on her plate. \"Trust me,\" Sam groans, \"if this food were edible, I'd be eating it.\" Aisha takes a considering look at the limp leaves on her plate, and decides she believes her. Which is a relief, because Sam doesn't entirely deserve Aisha's trust. She's grateful she has it, though. She looks at Aisha, a long look, and feels her heart clench. She's still frustrated with herself and dealing with random pangs of guilt for everything she did last school year. Or more accurately, everything she didn't do. Every time she avoided her in the hallway. Every time she made excuses for why she couldn't hang out. Every time she didn't say a word or even give a look when Yasmine made a nasty comment behind Aisha's back. She's not going to be that girl anymore. She's promised herself that if she sees an injustice, she'll speak out. No matter the cost. Looking back, it had been gradual, one small exception to her morals leading to the next, until she could justify standing next Yasmine as she sent a nasty meme to the entire school humiliating her former best friend. Maybe it had seemed sudden to Aisha, that one summer Sam had up and disappeared, but if Sam's honest with herself, it had started the year before. The year she decided she couldn't stand being chubby anymore. The year she decided she was sick of being overlooked by the boys, even more sick of being overlooked by the girls who were looked at by the boys. Sick of being the girl whose only use was to copy her homework. Sick of no one remembering her name except the teachers. That year, she'd promised herself she was going to be cool no matter what. Sam had lost forty pounds, so much weight that she'd reached her goal – visible hipbones and a thigh gap. And when it started getting too extreme, Aisha was the only one who'd said something. Her mom was just glad they were bonding over Soul Cycling and was too busy to notice, and her dad had been so skinny when he was her age, he thought it was normal. But Aisha, she'd been genuinely concerned, and it was that exact concern that pushed Sam further away. She hadn't wanted Aisha holding her back from who she wanted to be, hadn't wanted Aisha constantly reminding her of who she actually was: an overweight nerd who talked way too much about Legolas, whose best story was about her Rube Goldberg project, who had never been asked out and probably never would be. The moment Yasmine had started paying attention to her, there was no going back. Yasmine's nastiness only made her crave her attention more – she had to be doing something right if the meanest girl in school found her important enough to be nice to. It's strange how hunger and discipline can become addictive, if you let them. She's healthier now, but Aisha watches out for her just in case. She doesn't deserve Aisha's forgiveness, but she accepts it. \"The french fries aren't too bad,\" Aisha says, and dumps half of hers on Sam's tray. \"Thanks.\" Sam takes a bite and nearly chokes on it. Because at that exact moment, Miguel limps past their table. He's been out of school for four days. The swelling's gone down in his eye and the blue has faded to green and jaundice yellow, but there's no mistaking he took a hit to the face. He takes a seat at his usual spot a few tables over, between Dimitri and Hawk. Moon's touching the blue spikes of Hawk's mohawk and laughing about something. Her stomach is churning at the sight of him hurt. Miguel was a jerk to her in the end, but seeing him so vulnerable a few nights ago sharply dispelled any lingering anger she'd still held onto. In fact, it made her mind replay everything that had happened last spring on repeat. If she's honest with herself, she's thought it over a thousand times before he'd shown up at her door looking like Rocky at the end of a movie. Because with Kyler, it was all a front, but with Miguel, she constantly doubts whether or not it was. Miguel was the boy who was so dorky he wasn't afraid to bring her to a kiddy place like Golf n' Stuff on a first date. He made references to lame dad rock like it was the coolest music in the world. He did well in school and didn't act like it came easy. He'd read Lord of the Rings and thought Gimli was a badass. (They'd actually had a fifteen-minute argument on the scouring of the Shire.) Miguel hadn't even make a move to kiss her. He'd let her decide when to make the first move. She'd liked that best of all. He wasn't like Kyler, who didn't listen to no, who knowingly pushed past her comfort zone, who'd ruined her reputation when he didn't get what he wanted. Miguel had seemed so genuine. And then he'd gone and gotten wasted, falsely accused her of cheating, and instigated a fight with Robby which ended up with her at the other end of his hit. He hadn't mean to strike her. But he'd meant to strike first. And that was enough. Yet, if she's being completely fair, she had done to him exactly what she'd done to Aisha. She'd hurt him by being passive. Hurt him by not sticking up for him. If she'd only told her parents she'd been dating Miguel in the first place, the misunderstanding wouldn't have never happened. She's not responsible for his violent overreaction, but she is responsible for her part. She wonders, maybe, if her complete rejection of him was a knee-jerk reaction. A reaction more to what Kyler had done, to what she expected all guys to do, to how mistrusting she was of Cobra Kai, than to Miguel's actual actions. Which weren't great, not by a long stretch, but…he'd tried apologizing at the tournament. She hadn't been ready to listen, though. And then when he'd gone and behaved so viciously in the final fight after she'd left, well, that confirmed everything she'd needed to know. She catches him looking at her sometimes, in the hallways, in AP English, but he always averts his eyes when she looks back, like he hadn't realized he'd been staring. \"You can stop staring now,\" Aisha says. Great. Now she's the one doing it. \"Right. Sorry.\" Sam shoves a french fry in her mouth, forcing herself not to look at him. \"Poor Miguel,\" she eventually whispers. Aisha raises an eyebrow at that. \"What?\" \"Nothing. Did I say anything?\" \"Your eyebrow said something,\" Sam jokes half-heartedly. Aisha smiles, but it's just as forced. She blows raspberries and pushes away her tray. \"What's the matter?\" Aisha shrugs. \"Just feeling like a complete dick is all.\" Sam really doesn't love the language Aisha's picked up at Cobra Kai, but she's not going to complain, not when things between them are still fragile. \"Why?\" \"See Miguel's eye? That was me.\" Sam's heart skips a beat and she suppresses an irrational urge to slap Aisha across the face. She takes a deep breath and tries to calm down. She doesn't have a right to be protective of Miguel. They're not even friends. Robby had told her that Kreese had goaded some of the Cobra Kai kids into beating up Miguel. (And then she realizes, rather guiltily, that this is the first she's thought of Robby all day. She'll think about that later.) Technically, Sam should have guessed Aisha was a part of it, but it'd never crossed her mind. Aisha is the girl who dressed as a chemical compound for the Halloween dance. The girl who sang Love Is An Open Door with Sam at sleepovers, even though they were twelve and probably too old for it. Aisha, for all the ways she's changed in the past year, is not a bully. Aisha huffs. \"I knew it was wrong when it was happening. I knew we were pushing it too far. I decided to get one good punch in so Kreese wouldn't know I was holding back. But that was weak. I should've done something. I should've stood up to him.\" She pushes back her chair as she stands. \"I'm going to go say sorry.\" \"I'll come with you.\" Sam's standing before she realizes she's made a move. Aisha cocks her eyebrow again, and Sam blushes. They head toward the other lunch table in tandem. o - o - o - o - o \"Yo.\" Hawk gives them a lazy nod of his head without actually looking at them. His one arm is slung around Moon and his other hand is busy fiddling with his phone. \"What's up?\" On the other side of the table, Miguel drops his forehead into his palm. \"Hey,\" he says to the table. His food has gone largely uneaten. Sam fights the urge to turn and run away. He obviously doesn't want them there. But if Miguel and his sensei are joining Miyagi-do, they might as well get used to spending time together. Aisha takes the empty seat next to Moon, directly across from Miguel, and Sam's left standing there awkwardly. There's an empty chair between Miguel and Dimitri, but there's not enough room to squeeze by either boy and sit. At the same time, they both make a move to change seats, and smack into each other. Sam turns bright red. In fact, all three of them do. She ends up next to Dimitri instead of Miguel, thankfully, and across the table from Hawk. \"So what brings you lovely ladies to our private chambers?\" Dimitri says, his voice sardonic as always. \"Here for the view?\" He gestures grandly to the bathroom doors beside them. Aisha gets right to the point. \"Actually, I'm here to apologize. Miguel, I was an asshole. That went way too far and it's never going to happen again.\" Miguel brushes his hair back, even though it wasn't in his eyes. \"It's fine,\" he says quickly. \"Water under the bridge.\" His eyes shift sharply to Sam and then back down again. \"What can I say?\" he jokes. \"You pack a good punch.\" \"I'm pretty sure there's a lunch packing pun in there somewhere,\" Dimitri says, until he interrupts himself with the realization: \"Wait! You did that to him?\" Aisha ignores Dimitri. \"It's not fine. I talked to Sensei Lawrence, and I'm leaving Cobra Kai too. Just so you know, a lot of us are. I wanted to tell you in person that I'm sorry. Hawk, what about you?\" Hawk yawns, loud and obnoxious, and looks up from his phone. \"Sorry, I was playing Candy Crush. What were we talking about?\" \"You were about to say sorry to Miguel,\" Aisha says, in the voice of a mom whose children don't dare give lip. Hawk gives the table a smug grin. \"Oh yeah, that's right. Miguel. I forgot about how we beat the shit out you. How's your dick by the way?\" \"Oh my God, Hawk! Gross!\" Moon exclaims with an uncomfortable giggle. She slaps him playfully across the arm. \"I don't see why my dick is any of your concern,\" Miguel replies through clenched teeth. Sam feels her heart drop to her stomach and she clenches her teeth, too. The beating was worse than she'd even guessed. \"Eli – you kicked him in the balls?\" Dimitri asks beside her, his mouth literally dropping open like an appalled old lady. \"Hold up, hold up,\" Dimitri says, holding out his hands like a cartoon policeman calling stop! . \"I'm misunderstanding this, right?\" \"Don't be such a bitch, Dimitri.\" Hawk shrugs. \"It's just part of our training. But it looks like these two are too pussy to handle the real Cobra Kai.\" Moon shakes her head indulgently. \"Guys are so crazy, aren't they?\" she says to Sam with that airhead voice of hers, like Sam would understand. \"No, Moon,\" Sam snaps, frustrated. \"This isn't boys being boys. It's assault.\" \"Typical female. Always valuing safety over freedom. It's why they shouldn't be allowed to vote.\" \"What the fuck?\" Aisha says. \"Moon agrees with me.\" Hawk nudges his girlfriend with his elbow. Moon looks around at the table, uneasy and on the spot. \"Oh, I don't care about politics,\" she says, trying to please them all at once. \"It doesn't matter to me.\" \"See what I mean?\" Sam shakes her head and narrows her eyes at Hawk. \"You disgust me. And if your idea of freedom is the freedom to hurt whoever you want, however you want, without consequences, yes, we have an issue. What you did was assault.\" \"You know, your precious Miguel could've gone to the cops if he had a problem with the way we treated him. Hey Miggy, why didn't you go to the cops?\" \"Just drop it, Hawk. I'm not in the mood.\" Miguel's arms are crossed tightly over his chest and he's glaring at Hawk, but Sam can't tell if it's an aggressive stance or an insecure one. Probably both. \"Oh yeah, that's right. Your family's not here legally, so you can't go to the cops. And meanwhile, my dad's tax dollars are paying for your reduced lunch. America. Gotta love it.\" \"Jesus, Hawk. Stop being a dick.\" Aisha reaches behind Moon to smack the back of his head. \"I'm just pointing out the truth.\" He sticks his tongue out at Aisha, like it's all a big joke. \"Dude, Eli, you're Jewish.\" Dimitri sounds shocked. \"I thought the whole Pepe alt-right schtick you've been on was ironic. Are you joking? Please tell me you're joking. We've been best friends since third grade –\" \"First of all, you don't have to be a race realist to acknowledge the alt right makes some good points. Second, look at yourself,\" Hawk says. \"Still whining. Still wimpy. Still depressed. Still thinking grades are all that matters in life. Still blaming everyone else for your problems, sitting around waiting for someone to save you. Meanwhile, I can defend myself. I've improved myself. I'm fucking the hottest girl in school. Right babe?\" Moon gives him a smile that's more of a grimace. \"Dimitri, I'm telling you this because I'm your friend. Whose ideology do you think is working out better for him, huh? Just let me know when you're ready to step out of the hole of self-pity you've dug for yourself and I'll be there, man. I haven't given up on you.\" \"I told you about my depression in confidence,\" Dimitri hisses, his face red, his shoulders pulled in as he looks in shame to the girls at the table, whom he barely knows. Despite how obviously horrible Hawk is, Dimitri still manages to sound hurt and betrayed. \"Oh, I'm sorry. Did the truth trigger you? Do you need a tissue?\" \"He doesn't need a tissue, you need empathy,\" Sam grinds out. She's shaking in righteous anger. \"Right. Just like you had so much empathy for us when you were popular. Can't handle it when the tables are turned, can you?\" Sam swallows. \"I didn't. You're right.\" Her eyes flicker to Aisha. \"And I'm sorry.\" She turns back to Hawk. \"But this isn't about me. It's about you. And you're not going to talk to us like that. You're never going to touch Miguel again. Do you hear me?\" She standing now, leaning over into Hawk's personal space, her arms spread out across the lunch table. \"Sam, I don't need you to stand up for me,\" Miguel mumbles. Sam knows that even if Miguel wanted to fight (which he probably does), he's in no condition to do so. She's going to make sure he doesn't need to. Hawk throws his head back and laughs. \"What a cuck.\" \"I'm sorry, did you not hear me the first time?\" Sam shouts. \"Don't speak to us like that.\" \"What are you gonna do about it? Come on, princess, hit me with your best shot. I'll even let you get the first blow. It's only fair since you're a girl.\" He sticks his chin out. Sam shakes her head, boiling with anger but refusing to let it take control. \"See, that's where you're wrong. I don't need to hit you to take you down. All I need to do is this.\" She snaps back her chair with the back of her knees, pivots on her toe and walks away. In under a second, three more chairs scratch against the cheap, mop-stained tile floor. A moment later, there's another scrape, and Moon's jogging to catch up with them. o - o - o - o - o The first warning bell has rung and Sam and Miguel are loitering in the hallway. Sam's holding her Calculus textbook close to her chest and Miguel's hands are tucked into his jeans pockets, wrists bent. Students are pushing past them, hurrying to get to class. \"I appreciate what you did back there,\" Miguel starts, biting his lower lip and bobbing his head up and down – he's nervous. \"But I can fight my own battles.\" \"I know you can,\" Sam agrees. \"But I have your back, anyway. Like you did for me with Kyler.\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" He pauses. \"Thanks.\" It's September, and this is the most they've spoken since late May. Sam feels a lurching in her heart, like she has to fill up the empty space between them with as many words as possible before he turns and walks away. Before they spend another four months estranged. \"We're going to be seeing a lot of each other, now that you and your sensei are with Miyagi-do. I just… I don't want there to be anything bad between us anymore.\" \"Me either.\" He pushes a hand through his hair and it falls back down, half-covering his bruised eye. \"I…I'm really sorry for what happened at the party. I've been meaning to apologize for a while. It was the first time I ever got drunk, or was even at a party, actually, and I was acting stupid. I know drinking's not an excuse, but…anyway, I'm sorry.\" Sam squeezes her textbook more tightly against her, and the pressure is comforting. \"It's okay.\" \"It is?\" She nods. \"You tried to apologize before, but I wasn't ready to listen. For what it's worth, I'm sorry I didn't tell my dad about you. I kept procrastinating because I didn't want him to freak out about me dating a Cobra Kai. I should've told him right away.\" \" That's why you didn't tell him about me?\" \"Why did you think I didn't tell him?\" \"Nothing. Never mind,\" Miguel says, too quickly. \"It's stupid.\" \"No really, Miguel. What else could there possibly be – \" Miguel shrugs and turns away from her, so he's half-facing a flyer calling for West Side Story auditions in the school auditorium. Sam's heart drops down to her stomach, because suddenly, just from how he's standing, she knows what Miguel is going to say before he says anything. \"I thought maybe, I don't know, you were ashamed of me. Because I'm from Reseda…\" He shrugs again. \"I mean, you guys have seasonal Lakers tickets. Your dad owns car dealerships and I still ride the bus to school…\" \"You thought I was ashamed of you because you're not rich? How could you even think that?\" \"What was I supposed to think? And then you ignore my texts and show up to the party holding hands with some rich, hot white dude. I know the truth now, but, at the time…\" She wants to yell at him, she's so frustrated. How could he believe she could be that shallow? She thought they'd had a connection. That he understood her. That he saw more in her than a hot, dumb Valley Girl with a rich daddy. It stings. It stings all the more deeply because, with the \"friends\" she was hanging out with when they met, Miguel'd had every reason to assume the worst about her. \"My dad grew up in Reseda, Miguel. He would never hold that against you. I wouldn't either.\" A silence weighs between them, and Sam can't tell if it's good or bad. She feels like she's seeing him again for the very first time. Seeing that his home and his background aren't some random facts about him, but a part of him, a part of him that makes him view the world differently than she does. And maybe he's seeing her that way, too. \"You know, we really need to improve our communication skills,\" Sam jokes. It falls flat, but Miguel gives her a crooked smile anyway. \"I'm sorry. What did you say? I wasn't listening.\" Sam smiles back at him, and Miguel's crooked smile evens out into something almost real. The bell rings again, and they're officially late to class. \"I should go. I'll see you at the dojo tonight.\" Miguel kicks back his foot against the wall and Sam flushes at the sight of him leaning against it, looking so cool. \"See you then.\" As she walks away, she's shaking her head, mentally cursing herself for the mess she's suddenly found herself in. Because she still has feelings for Miguel. In fact, she doesn't think she ever actually stopped. She'd been too stubborn and angry to recognize her own emotions. What is she going to tell Robby?[Chapter 6] After a long day teaching, and the under the influence of Van Halen and sake, Daniel and Johnny hit the mat. Daniel's POV third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. o - o - o - o - o I get up, and nothing gets me down You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around And I know, baby, just how you feel You've got to roll with the punches and get to what's real – Jump, Van Halen Chapter Six: Roll with the Punches \"This is boring.\" The scrawny kid sighs deeply and throws himself on the floor on his back. His glasses fall askew and Daniel tightens his fist, attempting to restrain himself from exploding at a ten-year-old, if that. He has no idea how Johnny Lawrence, of all people, managed to keep this kid's attention. He has about the worst case of ADD Daniel's ever seen. Daniel's been teaching him for a little over a week, and each lesson the kid acts out more. He's worse than Anthony, and that's saying something. The six other kids in the class are staring at him, their flow interrupted. Four of them are Daniel's and two are Cobra Kai, and while it's only been a week and their rivalries are still pretty strong, it looks like they're united on being extremely annoyed with the youngest, smallest student in the class. \"It's not boring, it's kata,\" Daniel says, the effort of restraint scarcely hidden behind the calm. \"Now get back at the end of the mat so we can start the form over.\" \"How are you ever gonna beat anybody up if you go slow like that?\" he argues, jumping to his feet and sulking with his arms crossed over his chest. \"Karate's not about beating people up. It's about never having to.\" \"That's lame. Sensei LaRusso, can we do some real karate?\" Bert demonstrates with a poorly executed roundhouse kick. \"Kiai!\" he bellows out, actually quite deep for a boy his size. \"Bert!\" Johnny comes in from the other room, barking the boy's name. In a split second, Bert stops his nonsense and stands at military attention. \"Yes, Sensei!\" he shouts, voice pip-squeak high, little body quivering with effort. \"Are you giving Mr. LaRusso a hard time?\" \"Yes, Sensei!\" \"Good job,\" he teases and catches Daniel's frown. \"But stop.\" \"But Sensei, it's so boring–\" \"Quiet!\" Bert pinches his lips together to hide his smile. Daniel can't believe it, but the little twerp is loving being shouted at. Go figure. \"So you're bored?\" Johnny asks, a little smug. Bert nods enthusiastically. \"All right, come on,\" Johnny says. \"Strike me.\" The other kids are staring, suddenly intensely interested. Bert bites down on his lower lip and nods, serious. He deepens his stance and realigns his hands, eyes his sensei up and down, as if he actually had any chance of defeating him. Bert darts out an arm to land a punch, but Johnny blocks it with nonchalance. Only Johnny doesn't stop there. He grabs the kid's forearm as he ends the block, twists it behind his back, and forward flips him so he lands smack on his back on the mat. Bert tries to scramble to his feet, but Johnny sweeps his ankle and he slams down again, this time one his side. Daniel winces. Of course he spars with his students, but that was pretty rough. One kid hollers out a woo-hoo! and the class erupts into applause. When Bert turns around his glasses are in his hands. The wire frame bridge is snapped in half. \"You broke my glasses!\" \"Then don't wear glasses to class, four eyes,\" Johnny chides. \"This is a contact sport. What do you expect?\" Bert nods, accepting Johnny's answer without hesitation. \"And if you'd been paying attention to Sensei LaRusso, maybe you could've stepped out of that twist before I had a chance to bring you to the floor. Yeah, kata's all boring when you're doing it, but those movements build the coordination and muscle strength you suck at. Karate's not all kicks and punches. Sometimes, a simple side-step can make or break a fight. You have sloppy form, twerp. Do you think I accept sloppy form?\" \"No Sensei,\" Bert mumbles. \"Then show respect to Sensei LaRusso and pay attention to what he's teaching you.\" \"Yes Sensei.\" \"Now bow out. We've gone overtime.\" Bert bows to him deeply at the waist. \"Not to me,\" Johnny says, in the tone of you idiot. Bert turns to Daniel and bows, just as deeply. The rest of the class follows suit. As the students pile out the door, Johnny playfully shoves Bert with his shoulder and Bert grins up at him in complete worship, as if he were the luckiest kid in the whole world. o - o - o - o - o \"I know Bert doesn't look like much,\" Johnny says, chugging back a beer, \"but he's got a lot of need to give him a hard time or else he gets discouraged. You know, he always behaves for me.\" \"Noted,\" Daniel says, a little ironically. They're in the dojo, after hours. The last class of the night has just ended and it's only him and Johnny. Daniel came straight from the autoshop and taught back-to-back kata, conditioning, and advanced sparring sessions. The two dojos weren't combining as fluidly as he'd hoped and it was especially apparent among the older kids, who turned everything into a competition. Not that fighting isn't inherently competitive, but when you're teaching drills and the kids act like it's a life-or-death street fight…it gets pretty exhausting. These past two weeks have been the weirdest of his life. It's weird enough teaching together, but at least the fighting aspect of it is consistent with their old interactions. Nothing tops the bizarreness of last week, when they'd worked out inanities like scheduling and pricing and interior decorating before combining their dojos. Johnny'd said Miyagi-do looked like a spa in Chinatown that offered happy endings, and the remark almost escalated into a fistfight. It ended with Daniel agreeing to add pops of red, black, and yellow to the color scheme. Since when did they turn into old ladies? And who would ever have guessed Daniel would be arguing about where to display their karate trophies with his high school bully? By choice? \"Also, we need to work on his stage fright,\" Johnny says. \"We've gotta continuously pair him against older, bigger kids. Not that he had a chance at the tournament, but I don't want him freezing up like that again, no matter how huge his opponent is. Kid went down without a single move. We can't let that happen in real life. He has it hard at school 'cause he's such a weirdo.\" Daniel hates to admit it, but Johnny's actually a pretty good teacher. Excluding how earlier today he floored a kid wearing glasses and managed to break them, which could have cut the boy's eye, sent him to the hospital, potentially permanently blinded him, and landed them with a fat lawsuit. \"You're good with him,\" Daniel admits. But he doesn't extend the compliment to the other students. Daniel does a lot better with the quiet artistic types, who Johnny can't seem to handle whatsoever. Christ, he made Courtney cry. You can't tell a teenage girl that her pink hair-dye makes her acne look worse. Even if it's true. That's Teaching 101. \"Man, I'm exhausted,\" Johnny says, vocalizing his own feelings. Daniel gives him a hard look, taking the dark circles that only seem to highlight Johnny's blue eyes, the weary, sad look surrounding them, the light age lines that Daniel's somehow managed to mostly avoid, despite being in his fifties. He would never have expected life to be so hard on golden boy Johnny Lawrence, and it's humbling. You never know when the rug's going to be pulled out from under you, you never realize how much your success is the gift of someone looking out for you until that person is gone. \"Has Kreese given you any more trouble?\" Daniel asks. \"Nah.\" Johnny shakes his head. \"You know, sometimes I wonder if this wasn't too extreme. Maybe I should've worked it out with him.\" \"No way,\" Daniel says. \"I saw Miguel. I know what that man can do.\" His tone is forceful, even harsh, but Johnny needs to hear his complete certainty. When the guy talks about Kreese, he almost sounds like a battered housewife. Johnny can get combative about the least little insignificant crap, but Daniel's starting to notice that whenever it comes to something important, he's filled with doubt. So yeah, another way they're eerily alike. \"Yeah,\" Johnny says eventually. He crushes his empty beer can – a cheap brand that was cool with the frat kids when they were young, Coors Banquet – and opens the fridge to grab another. \"You want anything?\" Johnny asks. Daniel has kept silent about the fact that Johnny's filled the instructors' office refrigerator with beer. As long as he doesn't drink on the job, it's not his business. \"No thanks.\" \"Come on. Loosen up, LaRusso. You're not going to leave me drinking alone, are you?\" The fact that Johnny probably spends a lot of time drinking alone softens him a little. \"Fine. But I'm not having any of that crap.\" He kneels down in front of a bamboo cabinet that belonged to Mr. Miyagi. Everything he's inherited from his mentor is meaningful to him, connects them together, even an ordinary piece of furniture. Daniel takes out a bottle of fine sake and two ochoko, painted ceramic cups he brought back from his first trip to Okinawa in 1984. Daniel pours the sake and hands a cup to Johnny. \"So now we're taking shots of vodka?\" Johnny teases. \"That escalated fast.\" \"It's sake,\" Daniel says, a little exasperated. \"Whatever.\" Johnny shrugs and chugs it. \"Not bad. I expected it to be way harsher.\" \"Just because it's not harsh doesn't mean it's not strong,\" Daniel warns. Daniel drinks his and then refills the cups. They drink another, and another, and another, as they shoot the shit. Talking about old teachers and old classmates, old music and old movies. Just old, old stuff that kids these days don't even know about, because they're old. This is probably a bad idea. \"I saw you working with Miguel on drills today,\" Johnny says, a little too nonchalantly. \"Everything going okay with him?\" Daniel nods. \"Looks like his injuries are healing well. And he picks up quickly.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"He's not giving me trouble,\" Daniel says. Which is the truth, but it isn't the full truth. Miguel's mistrust of him radiates off like a biohazard warning sign. He's perfectly obedient, perfectly polite. But he steps back when Daniel steps near. His eyes turn to Johnny for confirmation when Daniel corrects him. When Daniel and Johnny speak to each other, Miguel stands at alert, ready to jump in and defend his Sensei. He wonders what the hell Johnny told him to make him so paranoid. Thank God the other Cobras had seen Aisha's trust in him and followed suit. \"How's it going with Robby?\" Daniel tries, but Johnny's eyes darken. \"How's it going with Anthony?\" Johnny snaps. For all the kids he's been helping, how is it that he has no idea how to help his own son? Anthony doesn't care about anything but gaming and food. Daniel practically begged on his knees to get Anthony to join Miyagi-do, but it's like talking to a brick wall. Anthony was born the year Mr. Miyagi died. The year Daniel couldn't bring himself to practice karate anymore. The year he'd gone deep into debt to open his first autoshop, and it looked like it was about to go under. He was six years older than when he'd had Samantha, and he was already an older dad. Anthony was unplanned, a challenging, colicky baby. Every cry was headache-inducing. Every sleepless night was more unbearable than the one before. Every milestone was less exciting than it had been with Sam, because Daniel had little room for anything else but his grief. If Anthony's more attached to his screen than he is to his father, it's Daniel's own damn fault. He pours them another round. \"I wasn't trying to pry about Robby. I was just being friendly,\" Daniel says. \"Well, that's new,\" Johnny mutters, somewhat mollified. \"Yeah,\" Daniel says, \"it is.\" \"Hey, use your evil robot thing to play some music,\" Johnny says after a while. \"It's too quiet.\" \"Evil robot thing?\" Daniel cocks an eyebrow. He feels a little ashamed for buying an Echo for the dojo, but better that than be technologically illiterate like Johnny. \"You just wait. I'm gonna say I told you so when Skynet takes over.\" Daniel shakes his head indulgently. \"What do you want to listen to, man?\" \"I don't know. Van Halen.\" \"Alexa,\" Daniel calls out, \"play Van Halen.\" The keyboard opening of Jump sounds out over the speakers, and Johnny thrusts a fist into the air. \"Hell yeah!\" Daniel may not be shouting it, but he feels it too – pumped up and nostalgic at the same time. He remembers the badass 1984 album cover, a cherub smoking a cigarette. It came out their senior year of high school, and he must've played that record a thousand times. There was never a greater guitarist than Eddie Van Halen. Hell, he even made out with Ali to it once. \"You know this song was dedicated to –\" Daniel begins. \"Benny Urquidex,\" they finish at the same time. \"Six-time world karate champion. David Lee Roth was a student of his. Of course I know that,\" Johnny scoffs. \"Man, they don't make music like this anymore,\" Daniel says with a sigh. \"No kidding.\" The joy leaves Johnny's face momentarily. \"You ever think that the world gets worse and worse every year?\" By the slur of his voice, Daniel knows Johnny's drunk. Which means Daniel, who is shorter and thinner and certainly more of a lightweight than a functioning alcoholic, is most definitely drunker. \"Like, I know old men are always whining about how things were better in their day,\" Johnny continues. \"But what if they're saying it because they're right? Like every generation inherits a shittier and shittier world.\" Might as well jump! Might as well jump! Roth is belting, and it feels like an imperative. Daniel thinks of global warming. He thinks of the disappearing middle class. He thinks of online bullying and nukes in North Korea and Iraq and selfies and Israel and Palestine and automation replacing jobs and the fact he can't go on Facebook without watching his relatives erupt into political arguments. He knows Johnny's not thinking of any of these things, but somehow, he aches at the thought that maybe Johnny's right. Maybe, no matter how perfect a nook he carves out for his kids in this big, chaotic, violent sphere in the vast emptiness of space, things will never be as simple and peaceful and meaningful as they were when he was a kid, when Mr. Miyagi and the greatest generation were alive to keep everything safe and sane. \"Well shit, man, you don't have to wax on and on about it,\" Johnny says, and Daniel realizes he was talking out loud. Daniel bursts into laughter. \"Wax on and on about it,\" he chokes out between laughs. \"What's so funny?\" \"Nothing. It's an inside joke.\" \"Come on, get up,\" Johnny goads, jumping to his feet. \"Enough of this morbid self-pity. Let's fight.\" The world's most epic guitar solo begins and Daniel grins, pulling himself to his feet. Mostly. He's kind of wobbly. \"For old time's sake.\" Johnny deepens his stance, and coils his hands into fists. But the smile on his mouth isn't malicious. It's playful. \"No way,\" Daniel says. \"I'm wasted and out of shape.\" But he is already standing, already getting into position. \"What, are you afraid?\" Johnny taunts. \"Come on, Danielle.\" Daniel closes off the memory of Dutch all those years ago, threatening him in the locker room before the final fight. \"That wasn't funny the first time around.\" \"Yeah,\" Johnny admits. \"Dutch was nutcase. I heard he was doing time in the '90s for sexual assault.\" \"I'm not surprised.\" Johnny's bouncing on the balls of his feet and Daniel finds himself doing the same. It has to be the music. And the sake. There's no other explanation for why Daniel roundhouse-kicks Johnny's head like it actually is 1984. His foot makes contact and Johnny stumbles back, but the move is too sloppy to do much damage. Johnny looks like he just won the lottery as he bounces back into the action, spinning to gain momentum before he elbows Daniel in the throat. Daniel miraculously blocks it, although not well, and they're caught up in a series of messy punches and jabs and feints and blocks and twists and staggering, drunken footwork they should probably be ashamed of. Johnny finally knocks Daniel to the floor with a front kick, but he's so drunk he's thrown off balance and falls down, too. They're laughing their asses off on the floor and Hot for Teacher is playing when Amanda opens the door to the dojo. \"Daniel, are you kidding me?\" She steps inside and shakes her head, furious. \"Are you drunk?\" \"Um…\" Daniel says as he sits up, shamefaced like a little kid caught with the candy jar. The room is spinning around in a way that it hasn't since he was a college freshman on a binge. Johnny's giving Amanda a look of pure admiration. Daniel doesn't like it a bit. \"Maybe?\" Daniel says, sheepish. \"It's two o'clock in the morning on a Wednesday. I've been trying to reach you for an hour. I was worried you were in a car accident. I was checking the sides of the road for your car in a ditch.\" \"I'm sorry babe.\" Daniel stumbles to his feet but Johnny's still lying on the floor, snickering to himself at Daniel's scolding. \"Are the kids worried?\" Daniel asks. \"Thank God they're asleep.\" \"I'm really sorry. We lost track of time.\" She shakes her head, but this time he can tell the anger and worry is wearing off, and she's actually kind of amused. He's never done this before. In fact, he's pretty straight-laced. Her lips are pursed probably because she's upset, but also because she's trying to stop herself from laughing. \"I'm giving you both five minutes to close up and then I'm taking you home. You too, Johnny.\" \"That's all right,\" Johnny says from the floor. \"I can drive. I've driven way drunker than this.\" \"I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.\" Amanda pivots on her toe and saunters out. \"Does your wife talk to you like that often?\" Johnny asks as he gets to his feet. Daniel tenses. He opens his mouth to defend her when Johnny finishes, \"Because she is hot when she's angry.\" \"Shut up,\" Daniel says. But there's not much heat to it. Amanda is hot when she's angry. She's pretty much hot all the time. On the ride to Johnny's place, Amanda turns on 80s and 8 on Sirius XM, and as they pull up to Johnny's apartment, the three of them are belting out 867-5309 together, completely off key. All things considered, even if the world is getting worse every year, at least some nights, small things get better.[Chapter 7] When Robby backslides into old behavior, he learns there are multiple ways a heart can break. Robby's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter Seven: Young Hearts Probably the worst thing about Cobra Kai joining Miyagi-do is that Robby officially has to listen to his dad. Actually, it's not probably the worst thing. It is the worst thing. A close second is the way Miguel constantly stares at Samantha, and changes partners around the room so that he never has to drill with Sam or spar with her or touch her. A close third is the way Sam knows exactly what Miguel is doing, and why, and how she averts her eyes when Miguel looks at her, and checks to see if Robby noticed. And currently, Robby's stuck dealing with all three shitty changes. \"You've got excellent form,\" his dad is saying, \"and your defense is strong. But you need to learn that your best defense is offense. Aisha was able to make critical contact because you let her hit first, you let her come to you. Sometimes, one hit is all your opponent needs to take you down. You need to anticipate when someone's going to strike, and end the fight before he has the chance to touch you.\" \"I thought Mr. LaRusso specifically banned the strike first philosophy,\" Robby says, arms crossed. He doesn't know why he's rubbing salt in his dad's wounds – he knows it must've been a blow to his ego to accept help, to leave his own dojo. But he says it anyway. His dad gives him a hard look. \"I'm not talking about randomly punching a stranger who gives you a dirty look. I'm not talking about escalating a shouting match. I'm not talking about starting up a bar brawl. I'm talking about feeling for when a fight is inevitable, when you're threatened, by a mugger, a bully, whatever. It's different. You know when a fight's already started before anyone makes a move to hit. And you have to do what you must to protect yourself.\" Robby nods. He could be pedantic, but it's really not worth the effort. And as much as he wants to irritate his dad, he doesn't, too. His teaching style's way different from Mr. LaRusso's, and Robby doesn't like it. Robby fights better when he's focused and calm, when he can let go of all the shit he carries around with him, the shit that makes him self-destructive, and just be in the zone. His dad, well, his dad riles up his students, gets them to tap into exactly the anger and aggression that Robby is trying to overcome. Or at least suppress. \"Now, let's say two attackers are coming at you at once. Miguel, Aisha, step up.\" Miguel gives Robby's dad an uncertain look. His eyes flicker to Robby and Robby shrugs. Miguel nods. They've practiced a few drills together this past week, and have even exchanged text messages (largely Kung Fu Panda gifs). But this is the first contact that's anything close to a real fight since the tournament, when Miguel deliberately damaged his injured shoulder and lorded his victory over him. At his dad's cue, Miguel and Aisha attack him simultaneously. He doesn't give them directions as to what moves they should attempt. He lets them duke it out, alert and barking out short, terse suggestions to Robby that are actually helpful. Robby has a perfect opening to side-kick Miguel in his lower back, but as he raises his leg, his knee bent, ready to thrust it out full force, he remembers Miguel laying on Mr. LaRusso's sofa, less than a week ago, and he can't escape the image of the purpling welts across the very spot he's about to hit. Robby manages to twist out of the motion at last second, leaving his face a prime target for Aisha, who instead of kicking his jaw, steps back, showing Robby the same regard he showed Miguel. And with that uncomfortable pause, with that unwillingness to escalate, the three of them know the drill is over. They look tentatively towards his dad, and Robby huffs out a breath of annoyance, mentally preparing for a comeback to his dad's inevitable lecture about how his hesitation and compassion will compromise him in a real fight. Maybe Miguel's the type of guy who'd target an injury to win, but Robby's not. Not unless it's a life or death situation. Robby's dad claps his hands, loud and sharp. \"Good work.\" \"What do you mean?\" Robby crosses his arms. While his dad's tone hadn't sounded sarcastic, Robby can't be too sure. \"You took context into consideration when you approached your opponent. Yes, we're learning self-defense, yes, we need to pratice, but we have to distinguish practice from the real thing. In the dojo, we follow professional rules and a code of honor that's different from the ruthlessness you will need employ to defend your life in a street fight.\" His dad's eyes flicker to Miguel, and Miguel drops his gaze down in shame. His dad clears his throat. \"I failed to emphasize this point before. That's my fault, no one else's. I won't make the same mistake again. From now on, we keep in mind the difference between the mat and the street.\" He clasps Robby's shoulder and walks away, moving on to Sam and Kayla to give them pointers. And Robby's eyes follow him as a he moves Sam's arms in the correct posture. What his dad has given him is more of an apology than his self-pitying, half-assed I'm sorry at the tournament. Robby thinks it might be the only time in his dad's stubborn, obnoxious existence that he's openly admitted he was wrong. And Robby respects that. o - o - o - o - o \"Robby, we… we need to talk.\" Robby cringes at those four small words. Because we need to talk always means it's something he doesn't want to talk about. Sam is fidgeting with her hands, and that sign is even more ominous than the words. They're standing in the lot outside the dojo, next to one of the vintage cars Mr. LaRusso said used to belong to Mr. Miyagi. Robby didn't know much about cars until recently. His dad liked cars so he decided he didn't. He realizes he's trying to distract himself, thinking about cars, so he forces himself to look at her. \"I spent all of last year being passive whenever something was wrong. When I got into a hit and run, I kept quiet. When Yasmine was bullying Aisha, I didn't stand up for her. When Miguel and I started dating, I avoided introducing him to my dad. \"I care about you. A lot. And as much as I don't want to hurt you, I don't want to be passive, either. Sorry. What I'm getting at, as hard as this is for me to say –\" \"You like Miguel,\" Robby interrupts coldly. He pushes his long blond hair out of his eyes and sucks in a deep breath, willing his anger to stay at bay. Sam has done nothing wrong, and she doesn't deserve him lashing out. Sam fiddles with the curve of her shoe, where the high arch of her foot doesn't reach the inner sole. \"I do. But this about more than Miguel. This is about us.\" She huffs, gathering her courage. \"What I'm trying to say is, I don't know how to put it. We only ever kiss? And not often. I mean, not that I'm super eager to um, well, you know, jump into things. But it's been three months since we started dating. And we don't really,\" she waves around her hands, looking for the right words, \"do a lot of dating things?\" Her voice gets pitchy at the end, so her statements sound like questions. She does that a lot, he's noticed, when she doesn't want to hurt someone's feelings or sound too assertive. He's so humiliated and furious he wants to shout at her. To blame it on her, to imply she's a slut for wanting that. But it's not her fault, and she's not asking for anything a teenage girl shouldn't want. He's humiliated and furious because it's the truth, and he doesn't want it to be. Robby closes his eyes. He thinks about that cool, quiet place in the woods, thinks about the tree, the callouses on his palms from falling down on the bark so many times. He finds his center. He's not a virgin, he's had sex with four girls, actually, which he doesn't think is a too low number for sixteen. He's never thought about sex as something important or special. It was a way to get off. Something to brag about with the guys. He grew up with the sound of his mom's bedpost banging against their shared wall and strange men grunting since he was too young to even know what those noises met. Why should sex be a bigger deal than the drunken one-night stand you forget about before the next tequila binge? But with Sam it's different. It is a big deal to her, and Robby doesn't want to ruin that. She's his ideal girl – beautiful, funny, smart, athletic, goofy, innocent – and for some reason, all the good things about her are what make Robby incapable of being intimate with her. He's such an asshole, because the moment Sam said yes, all the emotions that had been building up inside him plateaued into nothing. At first he didn't even know why he stopped wanting her. But now he gets it. He never wanted to be with Sam in the first place. He wanted to be someone Sam thought worthy of being with her. He likes the idea of her, what she represents – a happy family, a normal life. If he's honest with himself, Robby would rather have a girl who wants to screw him because he's hot. Sam cares about him in a real way, and he's not ready for that. He's so fucked up. \"Yeah,\" he says, defeated. \"Yeah, you're right. Things have kind of…faded out with us, haven't they? I'm sorry. I really care about you, too.\" Sam sighs with relief and gives his hand a little squeeze, a sweet smile on her glossy lips. \"Thank God you said that!\" she exclaims. \"I thought it might just be me. Or that maybe I'm a bad kisser and so you've been avoiding it? I don't know. I'm just, well, I just really didn't want to hurt you…\" \"It's fine,\" Robby says, the kindness in his voice for her, not himself, who's a fuck-up loser, and has managed to ruin another good thing, yet again. \"Sometimes the chemistry's off, even if everything else is right. You took AP Chem didn't you? You should know better than me then.\" He gives her a half smile. \"It's like we're noble gases when we're around each other,\" she teases. He's too stupid to get her joke. Well, maybe not stupid. He was actually put in gifted when he was little, but the older he got, the less he cared about school. And now that he's enrolled again, he's repeating Junior year, at North Hills, a much poorer, shittier school than West Valley. Sam and Miguel are in all the same advanced classes together. \"Friends?\" Sam asks, voice up-pitched and hopeful. He looks down into her huge blue eyes and has no idea how he could have possibly rejected her so many times, so subtly. He pulls her into a hug, smelling the coconut shampoo of her hair one last time. \"Of course. Always.\" o - o - o - o - o The music is pumping in sync with his heartbeat, and the table lamp above him is glowing ethereally, like a light at the end of the tunnel, like truth within his reach. He traces his fingertips across the carpet, feeling the sensation of the texture bump up and down. He presses his palms against his t-shirt, his face. His fingertips are tingling, leaving a trail of pleasure past everything he touches, and he can see his touch, like sparks escaping a magic wand. His vision blurs and focuses as he looks up at the college kids surrounding him, two girls pressing their bodies to each other as they dance, checking to see if the guys are watching, friends laughing in a corner, frat bros playing beer pong in the hallway to the kitchen, a loner girl markering a Bob's Burgers coloring book, two philosophy majors talking Kierkegaard and using that as the world's most pretentious flirtation material. Even if Robby only got into the party because of an acquaintance of an acquaintance, he can feel that deep down, he belongs to the grand unity of it all, a unity which he can see clearly for the first time. There's a connectedness here, a deeper meaning, an inner peace like Mr. LaRusso is always going on about, only Robby could never reach it before. This is what he was missing all along – an altered state of consciousness. He's reaching it now, letting go of his ego, of his anger, becoming one with the universe, and the vibration of his existence is sending pleasure up his spine – He's just lucid enough to realize it's only his phone again. It's probably his dad for the hundredth time. He rolls over onto his stomach and pulls it out of his pocket to turn it off and sees Mr. LaRusso's name across the screen. \"Hey Mr. LaRusso.\" \"Robby? Oh, thank God. Robby where are you?\" Robby looks around and smiles at a guy standing above him, who's wearing a sombrero. The guy laughs at him. No, not at, with. He's laughing with him. They're connected. Like Mufasa said. \"Whatever that guy took, I want some of it,\" Robby hears him say, and his friends are laughing too. \"Nowhere,\" Robby says. \"A house party.\" \"Are you okay? Are you drunk? You sound drunk.\" \"Nah.\" \"Good. That's good,\" Mr. LaRusso says, relieved. \"I'm high.\" \"Did he just say he's high?\" Robby cringes at the sound of his dad's voice. But then just as quickly, the situation is hilarious. He starts laughing hysterically. \"Yeah, I dropped a bunch of Molly. Hear that dad?\" Robby shouts into the phone. \"Robby, your dad and I are driving around looking for you right now. Can you tell me where you are?\" \"Give me the phone!\" his dad is shouting. His dad curses and there's the sound of a scuffle, and then, \"Robby?\" \"What?\" \"I've been calling you for hours! Where the hell have you been? I've been in a fucking panic since eight. I went to Daniel's. I went to your mom's. I found out where those thug friends of yours live and went to their places. Jesus Christ, I was about to check the hospitals. \"You were supposed to be at my place tonight. I spent two hours figuring how to use that stupid fire remote and rented Kindergarten Cop .\" \"Well now you know how it feels,\" Robby says. \"Do you have any idea how many times I waited for you and you never showed up? Screw you.\" \"You think I'm not sorry for that? I am. Okay. I failed you. I get it. But that doesn't give you permission to ruin your life. Now you better tell me exactly where you are or else –\" \"Johnny I don't think that's helping,\" he hears Mr. LaRusso plead. \"Please, just give me the phone.\" There's another scuffle and a kinder voice calls his name again. \"Hey, Mr. LaRusso. Man, I'm thirsty.\" \"Robby, can you please just tell us where you are? We're going to come pick you up, okay? No questions asked. No punishment. We're coming right now.\" o - o - o - o - o By the time they reach him, the last of his high has worn off. The bright colors are faded to a sad sepia instagram filter, and what was hilarious and cheerful is now mundane and empty. Emptier than it was before. There's no unity, no peace, no meaning. There's just a bunch of people he doesn't know who are older than him and don't even notice that he's there, they're too interested in figuring out roundabout ways to trick each other into a meaningless fuck. His head is pounding and he's thirstier than he's ever been in his life. The muscles and joints in his body feel loose and unconnected, and he can barely lift up his head. He's curled up, his forehead lolling down on his knees. He's a loser. A druggy loser who has to repeat the eleventh grade. A second-place loser. A loser whose dad doesn't want him. Whose mom doesn't want him. Whose girl didn't want him, and because of that, his sensei won't want him anymore, either. \"Robby.\" It's his dad, but it can't be, because the rage is gone from his voice. In fact, he sounds gentle. \"Robby, come on, kiddo. Can you stand up?\" And it really is him, and he really is being nice, and somehow, that's a thousand times worse than facing his dad's anger. \"It's okay, buddy. Don't cry. I'm not going to yell at you, okay? Here, give me your arm.\" And his dad's carrying him in a bridal hold, and Mr. LaRusso is beside them saying, \"try to stay awake, Robby,\" and he hears some rando saying look at that kid, fuuuuuck and someone else says does he even go here? and a guy belches, and then Robby passes out. He wakes up in the backseat of one of Mr. LaRusso's expensive cars, with his head in his dad's lap. \"How the fuck do you use this goggle thing?\" his dad is shouting, and slamming the phone against the back of Mr. LaRusso's seat. \"Johnny, calm down. I can't do it while I'm driving. I need to focus on the road and get him to a hospital. Just click on the icon and type side effects of Molly in the search bar.\" \"What the fuck is a search bar?\" \"I'll show you,\" Robby groans, pulling himself up to a sitting position. \"Shit, Robby. You're awake. Oh, thank God.\" His dad's hand is pulling back his hair, and he staring down into his eyes like the whole world is about to explode. \"I'm thirsty.\" \"LaRusso, pull over at that convenience store.\" o - o - o - o - o He wakes up with a pounding headache, aching all over. He's on his dad's couch, and his dad is sitting on the easy chair, staring at him with sagging eyes that probably mean he's been awake this whole time. Robby sits up and regrets it. \"Well, look who's awake,\" his dad says, and he's back to sounding pissed. Robby sighs. There's no getting out of it. He fucked up. God, he doesn't even want to remember what an idiot he made of himself last night. It's bad enough his dad had to see him like that, but Mr. LaRusso too… Robby pushes his hand through his hair, wiping his long bangs out of his eyes. \"Am I in trouble?\" His dad gives him a cold look. \"You sure as fuck should be.\" He shakes his head. \"Although I don't know if punishing you is actually going to do you any good. What the fuck was that about, huh, Robby? Jesus Christ.\" Robby clenches his teeth, suddenly defensive. \"Why do you even care? I've done Molly before, not that you were around to realize or give a shit. Anyway, it's not a big deal. You can't overdose on party drugs. It's not like it's heroin.\" \"You can't overdose? Let me tell you something, kiddo, I know how to search engine now, and you sure as hell can overdose on that shit.\" \"People don't use search engine as a verb, grandpa.\" \"Quiet! Do you know that crap burns holes in your brain? It can kill you with one hit.\" \"Well, I'm not dead, am I?\" \"You're gonna be dead when I'm done with you.\" Robby forces himself to his feet and storms to the door. As well as he can storm in his condition. \"Where are you going?\" \"To Mom's.\" He reaches for the knob, but his dad knocks his hand away, shoves him back, and blocks the door. Robby is in no condition to fight him. If he could even take his dad, which he probably couldn't. \"Just leave me alone!\" Robby shouts. \"You're so controlling and you have no right to be. Mom doesn't care if I'm out all night.\" \"And that's just one of a hundred reasons why you should be living with me.\" After the sounds of their screaming, the ensuing silence has a ring to it. Robby stares at his dad. He drops his hands down against his legs and then drops his eyes. \"You really want me to live with you?\" \"Yes. Of course. I've been pushing your mom on this for almost a year now. But that bitch doesn't want to give up my child support payments. I told her I'd still give her the money, but she doesn't believe I would if the court doesn't force me.\" \"Don't talk about my mom like that. She wouldn't…that's not why she wants me.\" \"Fine. Yeah, you're right.\" It's quiet again, too quiet, and Robby feels his heart beat in his throat. \"Robby, don't scare me like that again.\" And his dad's voice is low and broken. \"I thought I was gonna lose you.\" And Robby doesn't know what's happening, because his dad is pulling him into a tight, all-encompassing bearhug. He hasn't hugged him like this since middle school. Robby stands there and takes the hug, unsure of what to do. His dad squeezes him even tighter, and Robby finds himself pulling his arms around the man and tucking his face into his chest. \"Don't scare me like that again, okay?\" His dad's voice is shaky, and Robby thinks he might be crying. But he has to be wrong, because his dad would never cry. He's too macho for that. Too cool for that. \"Move in with me,\" his dad says. \"I'm not going to let you down again.\" His dad is definitely crying. Maybe that's why, for the first time in a long time, Robby believes him. o - o - o - o - o Mr. LaRusso stops by later in the afternoon. His dad \"suddenly remembers\" an errand he has to run, and leaves them with some privacy. Which is honestly more maturity from him than Robby expected. \"I'm sorry,\" Robby says once they're alone. His eyes drop to the table. \"It was really stupid.\" \"Yeah, it was,\" Mr. LaRusso says. He huffs. Robby can tell he's disappointed in him and that's worse than being yelled at. At least if he were yelling, Robby could yell back and not have to face it. \"I'm sure you don't need another lecture about how dangerous those drugs are.\" \"My dad reamed me up a good one, so no.\" \"Just as long as you take in the message,\" Mr. LaRusso says, giving him a long, concerned look. \"Yeah, I got it.\" \"I mean it. Don't do that again. You scared the shit out of us. We both care about you a lot. You know that, don't you?\" Robby nods, but he knows Mr. LaRusso is just saying it because he's nice and he feels like he has to. \"Robby…I hate to ask, but why did you do it?\" Robby shrugs his shoulders. \"I don't know.\" \"That's not an answer.\" \"It's the truth.\" He fiddles with a loose thread. \"I guess I just felt like giving up. I'm sick of…failing, I don't know. I'm not sure if that's the right word. I guess Sam told you she broke up with me.\" \"She told me.\" Mr. LaRusso taps his fingers against the table. \"Robby, you can't hurt yourself just because you're upset. I know breaking up feels like the end of the world when you're a teenager –\" \"It's not that,\" Robby interrupts. \"Then what is it?\" \"I don't know,\" Robby mumbles. \"Yes you do,\" Mr. LaRusso says, and Robby feels a flash of irrational anger toward him, for not letting him get away with anything, for forcing him to talk when he'd rather just leave it alone and forget. \"It doesn't matter.\" \"It matters to me,\" Mr. LaRusso insists. And Robby's vision goes blurry. But he won't let himself cry. \"It's stupid, okay? I just thought…I don't know. I thought that if I'm not with Sam, you wouldn't want me around anymore… For a while, it almost felt like I could be part of your family eventually or something, and when we broke up I knew that would never happen. I just… \"It doesn't matter. I'm messed up.\" Mr. LaRusso touches his shoulder. \"Robby, you already are part of my family. Whether you're dating my daughter or not. You were my student first. And that bond is for life.\" Robby stares hard at the table as he nods. \"Your dad told me you're moving in.\" Robby clears his throat. It's difficult to speak. \"We already worked it out with my mom. I'm enrolling at West Valley on Monday.\" \"I think it's a great idea.\" \"You do?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Robby, I need you to look at me, and I need you to listen to me.\" \"Okay.\" It takes all of his willpower to lift his eyes up. And there's so much kindness in his brown eyes that Robby doesn't know if he can take it. \"I was Mr. Miyagi's student for life, and you're my student for life. Nothing will come between that. Nothing. And your father…you know we have our differences. We both know his flaws. We both know he's messed up in the past. But if there's anything I know for sure about Johnny Lawrence, it's that he loves his son. If you need me, I'm here for you. If you need him, he's here for you too. You don't have to choose. We both care about you. Don't push us away.\" Before today, Robby didn't even know there was a choice. He would never have believed, with any certainty, that his dad truly wanted him, that Mr. LaRusso's guidance wasn't contingent on a thousand circumstances outside of his control. He's never felt this way before. He's never felt truly and completely wanted. He's never had the assurance that no one's going to leave him. He royally fucked up, and still his dad and his sensei were looking out for him, worried about him, carried him when he couldn't walk. And there's a weight that's lifted, in knowing, for the first time, that he doesn't have to go through this life on his own. That it isn't him against the world. That he has someone to answer to. He doesn't have to look over his shoulder and wonder if every good thing he has is going to be ripped away from him tomorrow. He doesn't have to wonder, every time Mr. LaRusso shows him affection, if this time will be the last. No one's giving up on him. No one's going anywhere. Robby had no idea a heart could break like this. Break from being so completely, utterly loved it feels like it will burst. o - o - o - o - o A/N: Thank you so much to everyone who has been reading and reviewing! I appreciate the feedback. Next week's chapter will be called Ebb and Flow, told from Miguel's POV.[Chapter 8] Miguel attempts meditation with Daniel. Miguel's POV. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter Eight: Ebb and Flow \"Your strikes are excellent,\" LaRusso says. \"You have good form, good aim, and your force is powerful and swift.\" The other students are paired up and practicing drills, and it's the first time LaRusso is working with him one-on-one. Miguel is surprised the man found it in himself to compliment him. He curls his lip up in something between a smile and a smirk, despite the fact he doesn't even like the man. Until – \"But right now, you're working with one style of karate, and that style can be limiting. Yes, you can punch, and kick, and hit better than most. But what are you going to do against a fighter who's twice your size?\" Miguel narrows his eyes at the passive-aggressive dig at how skinny he is. \"Who needs significantly more force and more hits to cause the same amount of damage? I had your build when I was your age. Actually, I was way scrawnier.\" (Okay, so maybe he's reading into things.) \"And let me tell you, no matter how hard you strike, if you're up against the Incredible Hulk, striking's not going to be enough to bring him to the floor. Your movements are strong and stiff, and there's a time for that. But you need to learn how to soften as well. You need to understand the ebb and flow of bodies in motion. Let's practice working with your opponent's force, not against it. \"Here, hit me. I'll demonstrate.\" Miguel aims to strike LaRusso's neck at a forty-five degree angle. He's shocked as LaRusso fluidly steps aside with mirrored footwork, catching Miguel's arm, LaRusso's movement matching the exact speed of Miguel's strike. LaRusso continues Miguel's motion, only shifting the angle of Miguel's wrist into a twist, and guiding that wrist upwards towards Miguel's head, so he's thrown off balance and forced to roll backwards onto the floor. It's similar to a technique Sensei Lawrence had taught him early in his training, though LaRusso's movements had been more circular than angled. But the difference, though subtle, is immediately apparent. When Sensei Lawrence blocks him, it always hurts, even when he doesn't use full force. The goal of Sensei Lawrence's block and twist is to inflict pain on his opponent. The goal of LaRusso's is to escape his opponent. \"Now you try.\" LaRusso waits until he's ready (which Sensei Lawrence would never do) and aims to strike him. Instinctually, Miguel completes the technique the way he is already familiar with, going full force, apologizing halfway through as LaRusso lets out a pained hiss and he realizes what he's done. They try it again, and he does the same thing. And again, and he still can't force himself to ease up, to melt against LaRusso's strike. \"You're still tense,\" LaRusso says. \"Try to loosen up. Here, let's relax for a second. Roll your shoulders. Do some stretching exercises.\" \"Yes, Sensei.\" It's hard to get the word Sensei out of his mouth, but he does, more out of respect for the wishes of his real sensei than LaRusso. Miguel straightens his back. He locks his arm up straight to the ceiling and folds to his side, focusing on long lines and perfect form, forcing the stretch as far as he can go – \"No, no!\" LaRusso is shouting. Not cruelly, but loudly, with lots of expressive handwaving. A few heads turn their direction and Miguel is momentarily humiliated. He usually picks things up so quickly. He stands at attention. \"It's not about executing a perfect stretch. It's about relaxing your body. Being in tune with it. Loosen up.\" Miguel tries again, but nothing he does satisfies LaRusso. Let go of your abs. Drop the tension in your shoulders. Feel how you're tightening your thighs. Miguel tries over and over and over again, the simplest, stupidest stretches, and he still can't get them right. The better he performs the moves, the more LaRusso criticizes. He's desperate now for Sensei Lawrence to stop in and tell this fraud to quit the bullshit, but it's not his lesson, and he's not showing up. \"Okay Miguel, that's enough. Let's try something new. Come outside with me.\" o - o - o - o - o He can't believe he's actually doing this. This is more hokey than the namaste yoga idiots who'd sublet the Cobra Kai dojo. He's sitting in lotus position, on the grass by the rock garden and a trickling fountain. LaRusso has him close his eyes like he's at church and about to recite the Padre Nuestro. \"Listen to the sound of water,\" LaRusso is saying. \"Visualize the movement of waves. The ebb and flow, the give and take. Feel your breath. Inhale, exhale. This is how I want you to visualize your movements on the mat. Like a wave, that bends and folds, soft but powerful as it strikes the shore. Now, I want you to imagine a beach, and hold the image of waves cresting in your mind.\" He tries. And surprisingly, a vidid image comes to him, of an ocean he's heard about in a thousand bedtime stories, an ocean he's never seen. When his Yaya was a little girl in Ecuador, she'd lived in a small costal town. The shore there wasn't like out here in LA, with crowds and boardwalks, trash and cement, a thousand retail stores and billboards trying to grab your attention. The way she tells it, it was the most beautiful place in the entire world, with more creatures than you could ever imagine, sea lions and tortoises and dolphins and tropical songbirds, with the clearest water and the whitest sand. He's never been to the country where his mother grew up, where his abuela spent most of her life. Besides other immigrants from church, the only people he knows who've been to Ecuador are his rich (mostly white) classmates who went to the Galapagos Islands as part of West Valley's spring vacation study abroad science program. His Facebook feed last spring was filled with photographs of sunburns and ocean sunsets, endangered animals and expensive bikinis. There's a photo of Kyler making a karate chop next to a Galapagos tortoise with #ninjaturtles that got 262 likes. The silent, painful jealousy returns. He hates the thought of these rich tourists using his homeland as a backdrop for social media attention. It's like they're violating a place that is sacred and his , and it's not fair he's never had the opportunity to even visit – \"You're tensing again,\" LaRusso says. \"Rein in your thoughts and find your breath. Listen to the sound of water.\" Miguel tries. He does. But he's too riled up, over nothing really. Why should he care where his classmates vacation? The Galapagos are hundreds of miles away from the coast where his abuela grew up. He sees his abuela, a little girl looking out at the water, wearing her favorite blouse that her mother had hand-embroidered. He wonders what the gestapo did with her rosary beads, a family heirloom that she always keeps in her purse. This might be all he ever sees of her again, images he's made up in his head from her stories. He might never again hear her dry, sarcastic humor. What if he forgets her face – \"Where are your thoughts?\" LaRusso says. \"Notice them and let them go.\" Miguel opens his eyes and the ocean is gone. There's just LaRusso, sitting beside him and looking concerned. \"It's okay. It's hard to focus in the beginning.\" But he doesn't want to let his thoughts go. His thoughts are worth keeping. His anger and his tension are, too. There's a lot to be angry about in this world, and letting it go won't change shit. \"Fuck it.\" Miguel stands up and storms out. o - o - o - o - o \"Sensei, you won't believe the New Age bull LaRusso put me through today in class!\" Miguel shoulders his way through Sensei Lawrence's front door, his hands full with barbecue chips, Mountain Dew, and a video cassette tape of Rocky II he bought on ebay. \"Oh.\" He stops in his tracks, because it's not Sensei Lawrence who greets him. \"Hi Robby.\" His face flushes, and he doesn't even know why. Robby stands there, awkwardly shifting from one foot to the other. \"Hey Miguel.\" Miguel peeks behind Robby's shoulder, like an idiot. \"Is Sensei here?\" \"Um…no. I'm not sure where he is. I think he's out on a date? He was acting all suspicious when he left, so that's my guess. Not to be a jerk but…how did you get in?\" Miguel tucks his hands into his jeans pockets and shrugs. \"We got a key to his place, he's got a key to ours. You know, we're neighbors. So. Just in case we get locked out or forget to turn off the stove or something. You know.\" \"Yeah.\" Robby coughs. \"So was he expecting you?\" \"Naw. I mean, no. I just…sometimes I come over on Friday nights?\" Which he realizes, belatedly, makes him sound like the biggest dork in the whole world. A loser who has no friends his age. Which is kind of true, now that he's no longer talking to Hawk. Dimitri's a constant downer and actually a bit of a snob, and when he hangs out with the other Cobras, it's more a group thing than a close friendship. \"It's like, not set in stone or anything.\" Miguel traces his foot against the carpet. \"So uh…why are you here? Sorry, that came out wrong. I meant –\" \"Nah, it's okay.\" Robby pauses and meets his eyes. It's almost a challenge. Miguel doesn't look away. \"I'm actually moving in.\" Miguel feels his chest tighten and suddenly everything seems very still. \"Miguel?\" \"Oh yeah. That's great. Good for you. Wonderful. Excellent.\" God, why does he always sound like such a loser? \"Yeah,\" Robby says, snidely. \"I should… go.\" \"Wait, is that Rocky II on VHS? That's the best one.\" \"Yeah, I just had it lying around –\" \"Man, that thing is ancient.\" \"I know.\" \"Thank God my dad finally got a fire stick.\" \"Wait, he did?\" And for some reason, that kind of hurts too. It's bad enough Sensei rejected his mom (probably because of him) and is out on a date with some stranger. It's bad enough he forgot that Miguel stops by pretty much every Friday night. Or maybe he didn't forget, and he just doesn't care. It's bad enough Robby's moving in and Sensei's moving on. He has to go and change something fundamental about himself. \"Yeah, but he still prefers the VHS player,\" Robby says. \"Go figure.\" \"Well,\" Miguel says. \"I should head out.\" \"I'm kind of grounded,\" Robby says. \"I don't have anywhere to be, anything to do. So if you're not busy, and maybe wanted to hang out…\" Miguel looks at the door. He looks at Robby. \"Sure. Whatever.\" o - o - o - o - o They're yelling at the screen during the final fight (Apollo Creed has just got Rocky good) when Sensei walks in the door. Sensei just stands there, flummoxed, staring at them. Robby grabs the remote and quickly off turns off the TV. Miguel feels like he's been caught with porn or something, he's that embarrassed. Not that he's ever actually been caught with porn. Sensei's face spreads into a shit-eating grin. \"Well this is great,\" he says, with a pumped-up enthusiasm that makes Miguel want to groan. \"How was your date?\" Robby asks. And while Miguel appreciates the deflection so Sensei doesn't go on and on about how wonderful it is they're no longer trying to kill each other, he really doesn't want to know how awesome and sexy the woman Sensei's decided is better than his mom is. \"I wasn't on a date. Is that Mountain Dew?\" Sensei grabs the liter bottle and screws off the cap. Robby makes a face as Sensei chugs it right from the bottle, but Miguel's privately happy that Sensei's indulging in the drink he'd bought specifically for him. \"Where were you?\" Miguel asks. \"You were acting all shady when you left,\" Robby points out. Sensei shakes his head. \"Aren't I the one who's supposed to ask you two that question?\" \"Answering a question with a question. Yeah, Dad, I know that trick. You're not getting out this,\" Robby says. Sensei crosses his arms. \"If you have to know, I went to an 80s night at a bar with LaRusso. Only it turned out to be super lame. Just a bunch of college brats wearing neon and dancing to Madonna and Michael Jackson.\" Miguel pinches his lips. And then Robby bursts out laughing, and Miguel starts laughing too. \"What?\" Sensei declares. \"What? What's so funny?\" \"Nothing,\" Miguel forces out between laughs, grabbing at his waist, which is getting a workout. \"Nothing at all,\" Robby says. o - o - o - o - o When Miguel leaves, Sensei walks him to the door. \"I'm glad you and Robby are getting along.\" \"Yeah,\" Miguel says. \"He's going to be starting at West Valley on Monday.\" \"Already?\" \"Well, what did you think? He moved.\" \"I guess I wasn't thinking.\" \"Just…you know. Look out for him at school, okay? It sucks to be the new kid.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" \"You doing all right?\" Sensei adds as an afterthought. Miguel shrugs. \"Fine.\" If fine means spending all of his time when he's not at school or the dojo alone. If fine means growing further apart from his mom because he doesn't feel like he can trust her anymore. If fine means Sensei being so busy with changing dojos and kissing LaRusso and Robby's asses that he doesn't remember they were supposed to hang out. If fine means being so worried about his Yaya that he hasn't been eating or sleeping enough. If fine means getting a D on his AP US History final and messing up his chances at getting into a good college because he couldn't concentrate because all he could think about was the truth about his dad. If fine means wanting Sam so bad he literally can't even stand near her without thinking about sex and feeling like a perv and somehow he's supposed to practice karate with her and actually touch her. If fine means tensing up and having flashbacks to that beating every time he sees Hawk in the hallway. Yeah. He's perfectly fine. \"Good, good,\" Sensei says, like he's not even paying attention. Sensei pats him on the back and shoves him along good-naturedly, but Miguel can't help but feel like he's being dismissed. o - o - o - o - o Miguel grabs his history textbook out of the back of his locker and shoves it into his backpack. He'd needed to take a bathroom break and now he has less than three minutes to get his things and run up two flights of stairs, the entire length of the school, and a block down the pavement to catch the school bus. He seriously hopes it doesn't give him an asthma attack, because that's the last thing he needs at the moment. Especially considering he no longer has an inhaler. \"Miguel, hold up!\" Still in the midst of jerking close his jammed backpack zipper, Miguel looks up and hisses as the zipper yields and pinches his thumb. It's Sam and Aisha, strolling down from the end of the hallway like they have all the time in the world. Which, upon consideration, they do. You can always tell the kids who have to catch the bus from those whose mommies and daddies buy them cars. The poor kids have to rush, forgetting homework or leaving their lockers messy, creating a stampede of black and Latino kids bottle-necking the front doors, while the rich kids loiter around, chatting with the other drivers as they wait for the buses to leave first. In fact, the whole bus schedule's screwed up. Last year, the board cut funding so the buses no longer pick up after school sports, which pretty much means only the kids who own their own cars or whose parents don't work late can attend practice. Miguel sighs, trying to quell the bitterness that's been welling up inside him lately. It's not Sam and Aisha's fault they were born rich. And it's not even bad thing to be rich, he reminds himself. He used to be a happy, easy-going guy. Now, he's constantly aware of the little things he once shrugged off. Miguel's not sure if he was just young and sheltered, or if what happened to Yaya has made him paranoid, or if sixteen years of little things have snowballed into one big thing, or if everything really has gotten worse, but he's suddenly seeing little injustices everywhere he looks. He can't wash off the grime of the word deplorable , and there's a simmering resentment in the mess of a thousand other unnamed emotions. So he's already in a bad mood when he sees that Sam looks pissed too. Hopefully not at him. He can't help but notice her folded arms are covering the small amount of stomach revealed between her crop-top and trendy, high-waist floral print shorts. God, why does his mind always go there with Sam, even when it's an inappropriate moment, even when he can keep his cool with any other girl? At least it's a distraction from his previous thoughts. Miguel forcefully shifts his gaze away from her waist, and then away from her breasts, but he's suddenly too bashful to meet her eyes. He meets Aisha's, and she looks amused at the situation. \"I thought everything was cool between us,\" Sam opens, irritated. Yup, she's definitely pissed at him. And he's going to miss the bus. \"Um…everything is cool between us?\" Miguel says, not bothering to hide his utter confusion. He throws his backpack over his shoulders and tries not to let it off-balance him. It's at least thirty pounds. \"I think?\" he adds. \"Then why are you acting like a jerk to my dad?\" Miguel winces. While he hadn't thought of walking out on Mr. LaRusso the other day as an insult to Sam, she has a point. He's lost his cool with Sensei Lawrence before, but that's always blown over after a sharp scolding. He should've guessed a pussy like LaRusso would've made a big deal of it. Miguel gives Aisha a pleading look, hoping she'll step in and smooth things over, as the mutual friend. Aisha shrugs. \"Yeah, you were kind of a dickwad. I heard the whole story.\" Merciless, that Cobra. \"Sam, I can explain –\" Miguel starts, but that's about as far as he gets, and he's left opening and shutting his mouth as he searches for words like an idiot. Because he can't explain. He doesn't even really know why he stormed out. \"I gave you second chance, and already you have to go and be an asshole. Come on, Miguel. I thought you were better than this. Why would you tell my dad to fuck off when he was showing an interest in you?\" \"I didn't tell him to fuck off. I said fuck it, \" Miguel says, rushed and defensive. \"There's a difference.\" Sam crosses her arms. She does not look amused. \"I'm gonna…go.\" Aisha interrupts awkwardly. Sam's anger drops for a brief second when she addresses Aisha. \"See you tomorrow?\" \"Tomorrow.\" Behind Sam's back, Aisha mimes a finger slowly slicing her neck, as if Miguel couldn't already tell he was in deep shit. He's going to text her tonight to tell her what a horrible friend she is. Before Aisha's even out of hearing distance, Sam starts up again. \"You know, I asked my dad to get to know you better. I thought there was a chance we would get back together. But never mind. I should've learned my lesson last spring. You're a jerk.\" She turns and Miguel grabs her arm. Over her shoulder, Sam glares at where his hand grasps her. She could resort to karate if she had to, but she doesn't. Miguel immediately loosens his grip. He hadn't meant it to be threatening, it was instinct that made him want to stop her from storming away. \"I'm sorry.\" He lets go of her arm. \"I shouldn't have walked out on your dad. I was frustrated.\" Sam raises an eyebrow. \"Frustrated? You have to give me more than that.\" Miguel bites down on his lower lip. \"I am sorry. I really am. And I'll apologize to your dad, okay? I like you a lot, but I can't explain it. You wouldn't understand.\" \"What wouldn't I understand?\" Miguel has no idea where to start. Looking at things objectively, Mr. LaRusso had done nothing wrong. Nothing to spark Miguel's outburst. But so much rage had accumulated inside him that Miguel simply couldn't take it anymore. So he stupidly took out his anger on the man who happened to be in front of him. But what can he say to Sam? She doesn't know about his abuela. She doesn't know what his mom's going through. She doesn't know it's all he can think about. She doesn't know he'll never trust men like her dad, rich white men who brag about their huge contributions to the annual police fundraiser. Sam wouldn't get it. \"I don't know,\" Miguel mumbles. \"Miguel, I'm really trying here. Please talk to me.\" He looks up at her eyes, big baby blues, and they're pleading. He doesn't know how to open up to her, but he has to. He has to or she'll walk away. That's the point of being in a relationship, right? Opening up to someone. Maybe he can get away with opening up as little as possible. \"I've just… I've just been going through a lot lately. At home. And um… yeah, I guess that's it. It's a lame excuse, I know.\" \"Okay,\" she says, and it's a little less annoyed. \"Did you want to, um, talk about it?\" Miguel kicks his foot up against the wall of lockers. He wraps his shoe lace around his finger. \"I don't know.\" \"Not to sound like a guidance counselor, but um, no one's like, hurting you at home or anything? Right?\" \"No. No. It's nothing like that.\" Miguel's finger is turning purple, so he unwinds the shoelace. \"Sorry, dumb question. Just checking.\" \"It's my abuela. I'm worried about her.\" He blurts it out before he can stop himself. There's something about Sam that knocks down all his walls. Sam's giving him a look like he's an injured puppy, and while it means he's out of hot water, Miguel almost prefers her anger. It's better than being pitied. \"Is she sick? My mom's mom had a stroke a few years back. It was a hard time for our family.\" He's ready to go with that easy suggestion. It's something she would understand. Everybody's grandma eventually gets sick. But Miguel briefly meets her eyes, and he can tell that she really does care. He has no reason to lie to her. Well, okay. There are a lot of reasons to lie to her, but he thinks he'd rather take the risk of telling the truth. \"No. I mean, she could be, but I wouldn't know. She's uh… she's in a detention center, actually. ICE took her.\" \"What?\" There's shock and disgust and horror in that one word. She actually has tears in her eyes. That quickly. And he can see the transformation in her face. That instant when the blissful thoughtlessness of life – the baseline assumption that everything will always be okay and that people are generally good – is stolen from you. And she hadn't even know his Yaya. There's a long stretch of silence. \"Miguel, I am so, so sorry.\" He doesn't meet her eyes. \"Don't…spread it around, okay? The Cobras know, but that's only because Kreese told everyone.\" \"That man is evil. I will never forgive him for how he hurt you. I hope he rots in hell. I hope the people who arrested her rot in hell.\" It comes out as angry as he sounds lately, so angry that Miguel's startled. Sam's the type of girl who's always smiling, a forever people-pleaser, breezing through life with her beauty and charm, friendly with the popular kids and the geeks and the stoners all at once. He didn't know she had that level of anger in her, and it's powerful. He feels solidarity in the strength of her conviction, in the fact her anger is for him, along with an opposing desire to comfort her, to keep her from ever feeling a single negative emotion. \"Don't worry about me,\" Miguel says. \"I don't even know why I told you. It's not like you can do anything about it.\" Sam meets his eyes straight on. \"No, I can't. But I can listen. I can be here. It's not enough. But I can do that. You don't deserve any of this. And your grandma doesn't either.\" And he thinks, in that moment, he might love her. It happens as suddenly and assuredly as it does in every stupid, unrealistic teen romcom, but it really does hit him that hard. Because she didn't try to justify what happened, or suggest a hundred solutions that he's already thought of, or recite some cheesy platitude, or change the subject, or act like she could possibly understand. She showed him that she cares. She showed him she heard him. He hadn't even know that's what he needed until she gave it to him. The tension he'd been holding in his gut eases up the slightest bit. Nothing is solved. But it's something. Miguel swallows and meets her gaze. \"Thanks.\" They're staring, and it takes them a few seconds to remember that it's supposed to be rude to stare. Sam's eyes flicker away and the magic recedes, just a little. \"Well, I guess I should get going,\" Sam says. \"Okay.\" \"See you tomorrow?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You're not off the hook for saying sorry to my dad, you know,\" she adds. She means it, but her tone is gentle. \"I'll call him tonight.\" Miguel watches her as she walks away, already of thinking of the best way to make amends with Mr. LaRusso so he can ask her out. He's not going to ruin things this time. He's not going to let some other, better guy come along and steal her away. (Even if she deserves a better guy.) And then he remembers– Miguel jets down the hall and overshoots himself from sprinting so fast, tripping over the orange cone that blokes off the broken drinking foundation. He pushes the cone upright and it wobbles as it settles in place. \"Actually, could you give me a ride home?\" he huffs out. \"I missed the bus.\" Miguel's not sure what he did right, but it must've been something. Sam's giving him a smile like he's not a complete dork. For a second, overwhelmed by an entirely different feeling, Miguel forgets all the reasons to be angry.[Chapter 9] The past is never dead. It's not even past. – William Faulkner. Johnny's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. A/N: I'm sorry this story is posted so late tonight. I had a personal crisis to deal with. Thank your for your patience and thank you for reading! Please let me know what you think. Chapter Nine: A Hit Below the Belt \"Miguel, you and Samantha are up.\" Samantha nods and makes her way onto the mat. Johnny's actually surprised that she hasn't given him any trouble since the dojos joined forces. He hates her less than he expected. Okay, so he doesn't hate her at all. Which is actually very annoying. He looks over to Miguel, wondering what's taking him so long, and sees Miguel giving him a look, eyebrows up, chin tilted as he mouths what the fuck? . Like he can't believe Johnny would do this to him. Johnny knows there's still some teenage drama surrounding his student, his son, and the daughter of his nemesis, but honestly, he couldn't care less. They're here to learn how to inflict pain on enemies, how to win a fight. Samantha needs to get used to striking harder and more deliberately, and Miguel needs to learn better coordination and not to neglect his footwork. And fighting each other's going to bring out exactly those weaknesses. They're going to make for a fairly entertaining fight, even if it's obvious Miguel will win. \"Miguel, get on the mat.\" \"But Sensei –\" \"No but Sensei . You and Sam are the only pair that hasn't sparred yet. It's been three weeks since we combined classes and it's your turn. Now hit the mat and show us what you got.\" Miguel crosses his arms, refusing to step forward. \"I. don't. want. to. hit. her.\" Johnny shakes his head and tightens his stance. He's gotta nip this in the bud before Miguel starts talking back to him again. \"I don't give a shit what you want. Get on the mat.\" \"She's a girl.\" Miguel tries, this time sounding more sulky than defiant. \"Excuse me?\" Samantha whips around to face Miguel. Her cheeks flush pink with embarrassment and anger. \"What does that have to do with anything?\" \"You fought me,\" Aisha chimes in. \"And lost, by the way.\" \"That's different,\" Miguel says through clenched teeth. Samantha puts her hands on her hips. \"How's it different? Are you saying I'm not strong enough to fight you?\" God, Johnny's sick of the 'girls can do anything boys can do' feminist crap. He doesn't know why the LaRusso brat has to get all defensive. She isn't strong enough to defeat Miguel in a fight. She's a good fighter – he'll give her that. In fact, she's the fastest of them all, and she can perform the flashiest stunts, too. No one in the dojo can hold a candle on her acrobatics or flexibility. But not only is she years out of practice, she doesn't have the upper body strength or ruthlessness Miguel has. And she'll never have them. It's rare to find a fighter as hardcore as Miguel, even among other guys. \"That's not what I mean,\" Miguel says, and now his cheeks are burning. \"That's what it sounds like,\" Samantha snaps, and it sounds like a challenge. \"Fine,\" Miguel grinds out. He steps onto the mat, glaring at Johnny with rage before he turns to Samantha. Miguel loosens his shoulders with a few shimmies and takes a fighting stance. But despite the first rule of Cobra Kai and everything Johnny has taught him, he's rolling on the balls of his feet, not making a move, and Samantha strikes first. It catches Miguel by surprise, right in the gut. \"Point!\" Johnny calls. Miguel recovers quickly. Soon, Miguel and Samantha are moving across the mat in all directions, blocking and sweeping and punching and kicking. They anticipate each other's moves so quickly and slither out of each other's attacks so gracefully, it almost looks like a dance. Samantha's harnessing her anger at being underestimated to excellent results. Johnny crosses his arms and cocks a smirk, impressed. The fight stretches on, minute after minute. It looks like they're going to exhaust each other before either of them gets another point. They're in the corner of the mat, close to the exit door, when Samantha aims for a back kick to Miguel's face. It's a gorgeous kick, a full 80 degree angle to make up for their height difference, and her leg shoots out in perfect force and form. It would've been epic had she landed it. But Miguel arches out of her reach at the last second and jabs his heel into her standing knee, grabbing her shoulders as her supporting leg buckles. With Samantha's balance off, Miguel flips her face-up on the mat. She manages to hit him with her airborne leg as she's coming down because he doesn't step away quickly enough. Miguel falls down, half on top of her, and in that nanosecond, Sam's already recovered from her own drop. She pins him efficiently and cleanly. They grapple for about five seconds until Miguel's upper body strength wins out and he flips their position. With Samantha now trapped under him, it's the ideal moment for him to make a strike. In fact, Johnny's waiting to call a point when they abruptly stop fighting, and Miguel shoots off Samantha like he touched a stovetop. Over his shoulder, without even bothering to turn around, Miguel gives Johnny a look of pure hatred. \"Happy?\" he snarls. \"Thanks a lot.\" And Miguel storms out of the dojo without looking back. \"Keep practicing,\" Johnny orders the class. He shakes his head as he steps outside and chases after his most infuriating student. What the hell is Miguel's problem, now? He was such a little shit to him when Kreese was around, and while Johnny can understand what was going on then, he's not going to tolerate another second of Miguel's lip. Especially in front of Robby. o - o - o - o - o \"What the fuck was that?\" Johnny shouts. Miguel is facing away from him, tearing through Daniel's cheesy zen garden, his bare feet kicking up rocks as he beelines away, ignoring Johnny. \"Don't you dare disrespect me in front of the other students, Miguel. Who do you think you are?\" Johnny grabs his arm and jerks him around. \"Give me a minute!\" Miguel shoves himself out of Johnny's grasp and turns away again. Johnny grabs him. \"Listen, punk. You don't tell me what to do. I tell you what to –\" And as Miguel adjusts his sweatpants, Johnny suddenly understands why he stormed out. \"Oh shit, kid. Sorry.\" He's vicariously embarrassed and legitimately sorry for like, a second, before he bursts out laughing. \"It's not funny!\" Miguel growls, mortified. \"No, it's hilarious.\" \"Shut up.\" Miguel closes his eyes and arches back his head. \"Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm never going to live this down.\" Johnny rolls his eyes. \"It happens to every guy your age. I'm sure nobody noticed.\" \"Well, don't be so damn sure. You should've seen the look on her face. Why do you think I didn't want to fight her in the first place?\" \"I thought you were pulling some sort of white knight noble bullshit,\" Johnny answers honestly. \"What if she tells her dad? I'm dead. I'm so dead. Is it possible to die of humiliation? Lord, please just kill me now. I can never face her again. It's probably going to happen again.\" \"Miguel, cut the crap. In the future, just visualize your grandma naked or something.\" Miguel gives him the side eye, and Johnny realizes that bringing up his grandma was probably the worst thing he could've done at the moment. Miguel lets out a sigh. \"You know you really suck at the whole sensitivity thing.\" Johnny shrugs. \"It works, doesn't it?\" \"That's not the point.\" There's a long hiatus, until – \"So how are things?\" Johnny tries, a little awkwardly. \"Your mom all right?\" \"I don't know,\" Miguel says. \"Why don't you ask her?\" Johnny's been avoiding Carmen for a solid week. He's made excuses, about being busy at the dojo, about spending time with Robby…whatever convincing bull he can come up with. The last time he saw her, they ran into each other at the apartment parking lot. Miguel was at school so they were alone for once, and they somehow managed to stand in front of her car and talk for two hours. One thing led to another and then Johnny was in her doorway, his arm pressed up against the frame, Carmen underneath him, her back flush against the door. He was seconds away from getting what he's wanted since he first laid eyes on her, and somehow he found it in himself to back off. It was the most self-restraint he's shown in years. There's nothing hotter than a woman feisty enough to slap him across the face (assuming he has it coming, of course), and Carmen's slap set him over the edge. He'd liked her before, but he couldn't get his mind off of her after that. He'd loved it when Ali smacked him all those years ago after that forced kiss, although he would never have admitted to it at the time. He likes chicks who are strong enough not to take his bullshit. Chicks who are stubborn enough to give him a run for his money, keep him on his toes. It's no fun fighting if you don't have someone who will fight back. Johnny likes the chase, the challenge. Which is probably why he's divorced and alone. So as much as he wants her, Carmen is off limits. He can't let his dick get in the way of things. Or let his feelings get in the way of things, if he's honest with himself. He likes everything about her. How she smells, how she speaks, the curve of her hips, the shade of her lipstick and the way those lips purse when she's not amused with him. She's an ICU nurse, which is about the most badass job you can get. And she's about the most badass person he's ever met. She left her home, her friends, her family, started life completely from scratch, never letting a single obstacle keep her from providing for her son. Johnny, well, he's spent the last ten years letting life get him down, giving up, failing to provide for his own son. He doesn't deserve a woman like Carmen. If he's learned anything from screwing up so badly with Robby, it's that he's not going to do that again. Not to Robby, not to Miguel. No matter how much of a brat he can be, Miguel needs him. And if Johnny takes it further with Carmen, he's going to ruin everything. Because inevitably, no matter how good it gets, Johnny will fuck it up. He'll get drunk too many times, or say the wrong thing, or screw another woman he doesn't even want because he's self-destructive. And even if he did do everything right (although there's no chance in hell), she's nearly twenty years younger than him and would probably dump his ass for someone younger and more successful. \"I'm not asking your mom,\" Johnny says. \"I'm asking you.\" A flash of mistrust crosses Miguel's face, but it's gone so fast he wonders if he imagined it. \"We've got a good lawyer working for us now,\" Miguel says with a shrug. \"It's crazy though. It's practically impossible to do anything. There's like a thousand loopholes ICE can use to keep Yaya locked there as long as they want her.\" \"That's fucked up,\" Johnny says, no matter the rants he's gone on about illegals in the past. The Diaz family are his illegals, so the rules don't apply to them. And it's a pussy move, locking up an old granny who never hurt anyone. Goddamn government overreach. He puts a hand on Miguel's shoulder. \"You're gonna stay strong, okay? Those ICE guys are nothing but a bunch of thugs with small wangs. We're gonna fight this and we're gonna win.\" Miguel nods and Johnny knocks his head onto his shoulder, pulling him into a half-hug. \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah,\" Miguel says. \"Fuck those pigs. The only good cop is a dead cop.\" And maybe the sentiment is earned, but chills run up Johnny's spine when he hears those words leave Miguel's throat, in that tone – cold and merciless and so far removed from the earnest boy in braces who came to him, begging for help with his bullies. \"Dad?\" Robby comes jogging outside. Johnny would tell him not now, but there's something to the tone of his voice that makes him look up. And the chills don't go away, because Kreese is standing right behind his son. o - o - o - o - o That man's hand is on his son's shoulder. Johnny recoils, his fists curling instinctually, his abs tightening as he tries to force down a sudden lurching in his gut. Somehow, in thirty-odd years, his sensei has barely aged. Kreese should be pushing his seventies, but he's not hunched or frail, in fact, his muscles are thicker than ever. If anything, age has toughened him, turned him into the sort of rugged, bitter old man no one messes with in Clint Eastwood's movies. An intrusive image flashes in Johnny's mind, and that hand on Robby's shoulder, thick and veined, moves to his neck, pushing his head back, tightenings until Robby can't speak, can't breathe – Johnny's arm is still around Miguel's shoulders, and unconsciously, he tries to pull Miguel in tighter just as Miguel slithers out of his reach, embarrassed to be caught in a hug. \"Get your hands off my kid.\" Kreese jerks Robby forward and Robby stumbles into the rock garden. \"Well, if it isn't Coors and Coors Light,\" Kreese says as he makes his way toward them. \"How quant.\" A vicious smirk crosses his face as he eyes the two of them up and down. \"Did I interrupt something? I always did think you were a little too attached to the kid.\" \"Don't be disgusting,\" Johnny snaps. He steps in front of Miguel, and Miguel side-steps him. From the corner of his eye, Johnny can see Miguel's hands pressing up and down against the side of his sweatpants, building up nerve for whatever's to come. Johnny's still slightly in front of the kid, and that will have to do. He knows Miguel won't abide being fully protected. Robby jogs up and stands directly next to him on the other side. Johnny gives his son a hard look, and Robby takes a single step back. Robby's arms are crossed over his chest, his triceps flexed in a tacit threat. Sam and Aisha have followed them outside. His four other students are peering out of the dojo's back door, assessing the situation. Aisha makes eye contact, and he can see she's itching to take Kreese down, but Johnny subtly shakes his head no. Sam's fingers soothe the back of Aisha's arm, and for once he's grateful for LaRusso's restrained \"wait for the fight to come to you\" methods. He doesn't want his kids taking up his fight. This is between him and Kreese. \"What are you doing here, old man?\" Johnny asks. Kreese stops right in front of him. Too close for comfort. Violating his personal space just to be an ass. Johnny feels a childish need to cross his arms and protect his center, but he knows it will give him a nanosecond of disadvantage if he needs to use them in a fight. So he keeps them at his sides, taut and at the ready. \"Funny enough, I came to ask you that exact question,\" Kreese says, that sneer not leaving his face. Like he knows something Johnny doesn't. \"What the hell does that mean?\" \"Answer the question. What are you doing here, Lawrence?\" \"What does it look like I'm doing?\" \"It looks like you're getting handsy with your favorite student.\" \"Fuck off, sicko. Only a man like you would think hugging is gay.\" Johnny once watched a nature documentary on apes when he was too drunk to get up and change the channel, and apparently you should never smile at an ape. Baring your teeth is a threat, a promise of violence. And that's exactly what it looks like when Kreese turns his smile to Miguel. \"Looks like those bruises are healing up.\" Kreese reaches out to touch Miguel's eye. Miguel flinches and steps back just as Johnny steps in front of him. Robby steps up, too. Kreese mutters \"bitch\" under his breath before letting out a chuckle. He turns his head lazily over his shoulder and says, \"Good work, Miss Robinson.\" And now Aisha's the one flinching, from guilt instead of fear. He can feel Miguel shaking behind him, hear the pace of his breath escalate, faster and faster. And he knows all too well what's happening – the kid's trying to keep his cool, trying to suppress a panic attack. On the other side of him, Robby is breathing in controlled steadiness. His body firm and upright, hovering protectively over Miguel. He feels a sharp jolt of pride in his son break through his fear and finds courage expanding in his chest. He's never going to let Kreese hurt these kids the way Kreese hurt him. Johnny remembers being thirteen years old, his knuckles black and blue from breaking board after board, that night when Kreese held him back for extra training after class, just the two of them. And he'd felt so, so lucky to be at the receiving end of Kreese's private attention that he would do absolutely anything the man demanded. At the end of the night, when he'd been shaky and exhausted and dehydrated, Kreese had ordered him to do a hundred pushups on his swollen knuckles. Johnny remembers the strain in his back and abs and shoulders and arms. He remembers trembling, red-faced and sweating, the sharp jolts of pain vibrating from his knuckles to the rest of his body as he forced himself past his breaking point. He remembers his arms giving out, tears streaming uncontrollably out of his eyes. But that didn't deter him. He forced himself back up and tried again. And he did it – all one hundred of them. Even if he had to rush to the bathroom to up-chuck his dinner. Even if he'd collapsed onto the toilet bowl, bright sparks and and black holes dancing around the bathroom stall. That night, while Jonnny was curled over a dirty toilet, was the only time Kreese ever spoke of 'Nam in any real way. Kreese had to make to his boys tough, make sure they survived whatever hellish nightmare life threw at them. Kill or be killed. No one would save you, even if you were sent to a jungle to save the world. Civilians were in denial, but it was at the core of every human interaction, even in the clean-cut suburbs, if you looked hard enough. No one would teach these boys the truth if he didn't. Johnny remembers Kreese putting a hand on his shoulder, telling him he'd made him proud. Telling him he was strong. Telling him he was brave. And Johnny would've dropped down and done a hundred more, just to hear him say it again. It took weeks for his hands to recover, in fact he'd fractured two bones, but the sickest thing of all was that he'd felt proud of his injuries. He'd felt lucky to be treated that way, because it meant he was special, singled out as better than all of his teammates. To Johnny, Kreese's attention, no matter how destructive, was a thousand times better than Sid's dismissal. Johnny pokes his finger into Kreese's chest, taking a power move from the old man's playbook. \"Get the hell out of here,\" he snarls. \"Now. You have five seconds before I make you. You have no right to be here.\" \"And neither do you.\" \"You don't get to tell me what to do, old man. I'm not your student anymore. I'm not your employee anymore. I'm done with Cobra Kai.\" \"Actually, I do get to tell you what to do, John-Boy.\" Johnny shakes his head, because now he has The Waltons opening theme in his head, and it only makes everything more disturbing. \"I don't think you understand, grandpa. That's not how it works.\" \"No, I don't think you understand.\" Kreese reaches into his leather jacket's inner pocket, and Johnny forcefully grabs one boy in each arm and slams them behind him, his heart running a mile a minute but time is moving excruciatingly slow. Adrenaline pumps through his body fast and intent and all-encompassing. Even the best martial artists in the world can't beat a gun. Kreese laughs again, and Johnny's clear-visioned terror settles into a mix of relief and humiliation at his overreaction. Because it's not a gun. It's a thick wad of paper stapled at the upper left corner. \"What's this?\" \"It's the non-compete clause you signed when you handed over the dojo.\" Johnny remembers there was a ton of bureaucratic paperwork bullshit he'd had to sign when all that nonsense was going down. About forty pages worth of small text jargon that meant literally nothing to him, except that he was losing the life he'd built for himself in the past year, and the only way to keep a small part of it, the only way to put a barrier between his students and a 'roid-rage psychopath, was to the sign on a dozen dotted lines. Kreese waves the paper in front of his face, like he's gained a beautiful victory. \"What it means, since you never learned to read, is that you can't teach any form of martial arts anywhere but Cobra Kai for seven years after you've left. And you can't bring any Cobra Kai clients with you to your new place of business, even after that time frame.\" \"What the fuck, that's not even legal.\" \"Actually, pal, it is. And you signed it.\" \"These kids can practice wherever the hell they want. You can't control that.\" \"Maybe I can't, but I can control where and when you teach.\" \"So sue me.\" \"Consider this a seize and desist. A warning. Trust me, Johnny, you don't want to be out of a job and using all your savings to fund your lawyer. You might be out of a home then, too.\" \"Are you kidding me?\" \"Don't blame me. Blame yourself. You're the one dumb enough to sign something you haven't read. You had a good thing going, but you were too dumb to see that, too. You thought running away was going to magically fix your life? What a pussy.\" \"What's going on?\" LaRusso shoves his way through the students clustered at the door. He jogs up to them, tense and defensive, and steps beside Johnny, directly in front of Robby. \"Get of my property,\" LaRusso says, and those words are a threat. Kreese holds up his arms. \"Sorry little buddy. Just stopping by for a friendly chat with your employee.\" \"He's my business partner.\" \"Well, not anymore.\" Kreese smacks the paperwork against his palm. \"Are you aware he's violating a non-compete clause? Because I could sue you too.\" LaRusso turns to Johnny and gives him a look of horrified frustration. \"You signed a non-compete?\" Like Johnny's a complete idiot. \"Why the hell would you do that?\" \"Is not like it was a choice, was it?\" Johnny snaps, suddenly feeling like a stupid little kid. How is it that everybody knows about this shit but him? Johnny turns to Kreese and grabs at the collar of the man's t-shirt. He jerks Kreese toward him so they're neck and neck. \"Guess you're too much of a pussy to handle this like a man, huh? Are you too old and frail to settle this the good ole-fashioned way? You need lawyers and courts to do your dirty work for you now? Is that it?\" Kreese looks down at Johnny's fist, straining his shirt. He carelessly flicks at Johnny's hand and it takes Johnny all the restraint within himself not the punch the man out. \"Those are big words coming from a little bitch like you,\" Kreese says, eyeing him up and down. \"Think I don't remember what a pathetic crier you were when you first came to me? You were such a desperate tag-along, and now you're nothing but a washed-up has been. Look at you, running to LaRusso like a damsel in distress, begging a bigger, better man to rescue you from your mean old teacher. You're pathetic, Johnny. It makes me sick to even look at you.\" \"You're the one who's pathetic!\" Johnny shouts. \"You need to beat down on teenagers to feel strong. You know, someone wise once told me there's no bad students. Only bad teachers.\" Johnny's eyes shift quickly to LaRusso, who, by the look on his face, hadn't known Robby'd shared that story with Johnny. Johnny turns back to Kreese, his righteous fury renewed. \"And you fucking suck.\" Kreese scoffs. \"You honestly think you're a better teacher than me? You want to prove it?\" Johnny's hands are coiled into fists. His teeth are clenched, his shoulders are hunched. He's going to kill him. \"I can take you.\" \"Johnny, calm down,\" LaRusso warns. \"No, no,\" Kreese taunts. \"Let's see what he's got.\" \"Fine,\" Johnny says. \"We'll fight right now. I win, you rip up that piece of garbage and leave me, my students, and Miyagi-do alone. You win, I quit teaching karate forever.\" \"Johnny, don't do this –\" \"LaRusso, stay out of it –\" \"I agree to the terms,\" Kreese interrupts. \"All right then,\" Johnny says, bouncing on the balls of his feet, itching for the fight that's going to end this man's power over him once and forever. \"Come at me, old man.\" Kreese crosses his arms, and his smirk makes Johnny sick. \"We're not settling who's the better fighter. We're settling who's the better teacher. Miguel,\" Kreese directs his attention to Miguel. \"Are you as much of a pussy as I think you are, or are you up for the challenge?\" Miguel's gaze shifts sharply to Johnny, his brown eyes wide. But before Johnny can respond, Miguel faces Kreese. Johnny sees his Adam's apple slide down his throat as he swallows his fear. \"You want me to fight you?\" \"You're not touching him!\" Johnny shouts, knocking Miguel behind him. \"Don't get your panties in a twist,\" Kreese says. \"Of course I'm not. It's my student against yours or nothing. Miguel versus Hawk.\" \"Absolutely not!\" \"But Sensei –\" \"No, Miguel! Don't you dare interrupt.\" \"Let the boy speak for himself,\" Kreese says. \"Leave the kid alone and get off my property,\" LaRusso cuts in. \"NO!\" Miguel insists. \"Let me talk.\" Miguel steps in front of Johnny. \"I'll do it.\" \"Miguel –\" Miguel snaps around, and Johnny can't bear the look in the kid's eyes. It's the same way he used to look at Kreese – the love of a lost boy toward the only man who's ever paid attention to him, the only man who's ever acted like a father. Vulnerable and giving and unaware of how much of himself he's exposing. Miguel will do anything for him. The way Johnny would have done anything for Kreese at that age. Johnny doesn't know if he can handle that responsibility right now. He wants to run from it. He wants to get wasted and give up. He wants to abandon Miguel and let him find some other sucker to be his surrogate dad. He wants to abandon Robby to LaRusso, who's better for the kid anyway. But he can't give up. He can't let Miguel fight. He's not going to use his student the way Kreese used him. \"Sensei, do you honestly think I'm going to let him keep you from teaching karate?\" Miguel asks, gesturing widely with his arms. \"How you could think that of me? Karate's your calling. It's your life. And I don't want any other teacher but you. I'll fight. Let me fight and I'll make you proud.\" His voice breaks, like it always does when he gets overly emotional. \"Miguel, this is not your fight.\" \"It's your fight. So it's my fight.\" \"That's not how this works.\" \"It is how this works.\" \"Kid's got gumption after all,\" Kreese says with a snort. \"He's not fighting.\" \"You think I can't take Hawk, is that it?\" Miguel crosses his arms. His eyes turn tear-dropped shaped and his lower lip actually pouts like a fucking Precious Moment. \"Is it because of that beating? Because I was injured and that was five against one. I won't lose again. I promise.\" \"Miguel, this is not about you or your skill. I simply won't allow it.\" \"Why not?\" \"Don't question me.\" \"But Sensei –\" \"Quiet! My answer is final.\" Miguel glares at him before dropping his gaze, his cheeks red. And Johnny realizes, a second too late, how Miguel must see it – that he was publicly rejected and scolded. Jesus. Which wasn't at all what he was trying to do. He was trying to protect him, but course he fucked it all up again. He always says the wrong thing. \"Miguel…\" Johnny tries, gently this time. \"Whatever,\" Miguel answers through clenched teeth. \"I get it.\" Johnny really does not have the time or the patience to alleviate Miguel's inferiority complex right now. Not while he has to deal with everything else. Losing his career, his students, his self-respect, his income, his whole goddamn life. As long as he can get Miguel to back off from the fight, that has to be good enough for now. He needs to get Kreese away before this escalates further. Johnny opens his mouth, but someone else speaks first. \"Get out off my property, you bastard.\" LaRusso's got his back. And despite being the one reining Johnny in, LaRusso's hands are in fists. \" Now ,\" LaRusso growls. \"And stay the hell away from these kids.\"[Chapter 10] Miguel is tested. Miguel's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. A/N: If you tried to read this chapter immediately after I posted it, the formatting was wrong. Sorry! Chapter Ten: Mortal Combat Miguel's phone buzzes and he pulls it out of his pocket. Too pussy to fight? It's Hawk's number. He's going to ignore it. He's going to listen to Sensei Lawrence. He flicks his finger up the screen, flashing through the history of their friendship in backwards order. He knows he shouldn't, but at least it's not texting back. He looks at the crude memes they've sent each other, the boring homework questions, the karate scheduling coordination, the inside joke about Doritos they reference over and over… He stops at a selfie of them together. Miguel's making a muscle, half-ironically, his smile wide, and Hawk's sticking out his tongue, one hand slung around Miguel, one hand raised in metal horns. His blue hair is wet and flat because it was taken just after they'd showered following the tournament. Miguel remembers how good it felt, to be a champion. To be part of a powerful team. The two of them were like brothers, the day of the All Valley, the months leading up to it when they'd trained and sweated and bled together. Which makes it that much worse. He feels his stomach recoil in hatred at the sound of Hawk's words, humiliating him for his reduced lunch. He winces at the thought of Hawk crushing his crotch with his heel, the sickening memory almost as real as the first time around. His phone vibrates again, and he has to scroll all the way down to see the new text. So much for being loyal to Lawrence. Isn't that why you left CK in the first place? You're really gonna let him lose everything because you're not man enough to fight? Miguel checks to make sure the coast is clear, but of course it's clear. He's home alone. He's still not used to being home alone. Screw Sensei Lawrence's overprotective bullshit. He's a better fighter than Hawk. He can win this. He's going to destroy the bastard. Hawk and Kreese both. He's going to make sure no one ever messes with him or Sensei ever again. No mercy. I'm in. Fucking A! Hawk texts back. I knew you'd be in. Miguel rolls his eyes at the tongue-out emoji. Who does Hawk think he is? Steve Tyler? If I win, Kreese leaves Sensei Lawrence alone, Miguel types. No lawsuits. No contact. Nothing. He rips up the paperwork. That's the deal. Who's referee? We need someone neutral. Referee? Did you forget the /s? No referee. We're not fighting for points. It's FTW. What determines who wins? The person who remains standing. When and where? Lot behind CK, midnight this Sunday. Keep it on the DL. It'll just be me and Sensei Kreese. Bring a second. He can't tell Sam. He would never put her in danger. He can't tell Sensei Lawrence. He'd made it clear that he absolutely forbids him to enter this fight. He can't tell LaRusso, whose non-violence mantra is laughable. He remembers lying on the sofa, Robby handing him more painkillers than an adult would allow. He remembers the pact that they'd made to look out for Sensei. To stand up to Kreese. To keep each other informed. I'm doing it, Miguel texts Robby. You in as my second? Don't tell anyone. o - o - o - o - o Even in the nighttime November air, the stench of garbage pervades the vacant lot behind the strip mall. Miguel can feel the gravel roll beneath the thin soles of his Converse, and he wraps his arms more tightly around himself, his hoodie pulled up to block out the wind. Maybe acid-washed skinny jeans aren't the best pants to wear to a street fight, too restrictive normally, but his have become loose over the last few months. He's nearly as underweight as he was when he first met Sensei Lawrence, before he built muscle mass from his training. He hasn't been eating enough, and he isn't in his best shape, but it's too late to turn back now. He'll have to face Hawk as he is. At least he looks cool in the jeans (he'd seen a photo of Sensei in the same style) and the formless hoodie disguises most of the weight loss. Robby's walking beside him, and from the corner of his eye, Miguel can see the cautious way Robby looks over his shoulder, using his body to half-block Miguel. Miguel doesn't need a protector, and it's a little irritating, but it's reassuring, too, knowing that Robby has his back in case Kreese tries to pull any shady shit. It's weird, but he's feeling oddly nostalgic about the lot. Sometimes, before the other students signed up, he'd hang out here with Sensei while Sensei drank a beer and gave him life advice. Sensei would toss his litter into a pile next to the long line of garbage bins, never missing his shot. Miguel used to pick them up and sort them into the correct recycling containers, but after a while, he gave up on it, and there's a pile of Sensei's beer bottles and crushed cans, like a drunkard's cairn. (He was proud of that word when he thought of it – it's an SAT word.) Miguel misses that time, before Robby was around, before Aisha and the others were around, when it was just the two of them. Back when Sensei had faith in him. Now, he doesn't even trust Miguel to win this fight. He misses the old dojo, the stenciled snake on the wall, the motto, the bold colors bordering the room. He even misses the smell of stinky feet and sweat and too much Axe deodorant. He doesn't know what LaRusso does, but that place always smells like cedar and lemon. Which should technically be nice, but it's just…less real to him. He misses hanging out after class and grabbing a slice of pizza at the minimart where Sensei first saved him. How could everything have changed so much in so little time? Miguel's going to prove himself tonight. Even if Sensei has forbidden this, he'll make the man see the error of his ways. He's going to make his teacher proud. And then everything will be back to normal between them. The homeless woman who used to hang out outside the dojo's strolling around and she gives him a nod. \"Haven't seen you around in a while. Hey, are you selling?\" \"Um…no? Why would you think that?\" \"The covert midnight meeting,\" she says, and strolls past them, whistling. She's already high. \"But mostly the hoodie. Makes you look like a dealer. Got meth?\" After a brief, absurd image of a public service Got Meth? poster, Miguel thinks about his dad, and wonders who else looks at him and sees nothing but a gang banger. Nothing but a suspicious brown kid in a hoodie. He wonders how much of their prejudice and assumptions are just shy of the truth. Maybe he's never actually seen hard drugs in person, or smoked more than one puff of pot with his Yaya, but his dad's a kingpin, so there's that. Stereotype confirmed. \"You don't have to do this, you know,\" Robby says, jiggling his keys in his pocket. He's antsy, and so is Miguel. It's three minutes to midnight and Kreese and Hawk haven't shown. They'll probably show up late on purpose to psych him out. \"I do have to do it,\" Miguel says, even though his stomach's lurching and he doesn't want to. \"I have to protect Sensei. After everything he's done for me, I'm going to return the favor.\" Robby gives him a reluctant nod. \"If you're sure.\" \"I'm sure.\" \"Because he doesn't want you to do it. And I'm starting to agree.\" \"Are you losing your nerve?\" \"Maybe,\" Robby admits. \"I just…I have a bad feeling about this. I don't trust Kreese to play fair.\" \"Me either.\" Miguel swallows. \"But that's life, right? Nobody plays fair.\" Miguel jumps in place at the horror-movie creak as the back door of the dojo opens. Kreese exits with Hawk at his heels. He wonders how long they'd been waiting there, if they'd overheard their conversation. \"Well, look who bothered to show up. I'm impressed, Taco. I didn't think you had it in you. And you even brought your boyfriend. Cute.\" Miguel crosses his arms and glares at Kreese. \"There're two of you. It's only fair.\" Hawk jerks his head up at him in a \"too cool to actually speak to you\" greeting. His infamous mohawk is gelled spikey and tall, and he's shirtless, the tattoo sprawled across his back displayed like warrior paint. He'd started out scrawnier and dorkier and meeker than even Miguel had ever been, but he's been getting more and more cut since he'd first joined Cobra Kai. Now, it's just absurd. Hawk is ripped . Nobody can gain that much muscle that fast naturally. \"Last chance to back out, Miggy.\" Hawk spits out Miguel's mom's pet name for him with derision. \"I'm not backing out.\" Hawk sucker punches him in the gut, knocking him straight into Robby. \"Good.\" Robby instinctively catches Miguel and tries to help him up, but Kreese snatches Robby's arm and tugs him away from the brawl. \"One on one,\" Kreese says, at the same moment Hawk aims a sidekick to Miguel's crotch. Miguel catches his heel, twists sharply, and flips Hawk to his face on the gravel. As Miguel's readjusting his stance, Hawk sweeps his leg against Miguel's ankle, grabs his tumbling form for purchase and the two of them beat into each other, messy and raw and dangerous. Miguel gets a good one to Hawk's mouth and snarls, \"Too bad no one will notice the difference, Lip.\" \"You'll pay for that!\" Hawk grabs him by the front of his hair and slams the heel of his palm into Miguel's nose. Everything goes black for a second, and the lower half of his face is warm and wet, and then the pain kicks in full gear. His nose is definitely broken. He can't even breathe out of it. He hears Robby begging him to stop in the background. But fuck if he's going to let Sensei lose his life and livelihood to these evil shitheads. Miguel blocks Hawk's undercut punch and kicks in his knee as hard as he can. Hawk's scream is sharp and high pitched. It's not like fighting in the dojo or a tournament. There's no one to call a point or time out. There's no rules to violate, no form to show off, no guidelines for sportsmanlike behavior. It's two guys slamming into each other with all their hate, doing whatever it takes to take down the other. As Hawk comes down, he grasps Miguel's arm and jerks it out of its socket and they're scrambling in the gravel, attempting to pin one another as they knock over a trash can and the rotten waste spreads out over the ground. They roll in it, punch in it, kick in it, and Miguel's gut lurches at the stench of bad meat but he continues anyway. And despite using every last ounce of his strength, every last ounce of his energy, Hawk throws him at last, slamming the back of his head into the gravel, jamming his knee into his gut so he can't breathe at all. Hawk holds his neck down with one hand and jabs his fist into Miguel's ribcage with methodical repetition. Miguel can't focus, the pain is too strong, he can't think about anything but how helpless he is. But he needs to hold on, he needs to figure out a way to get out of this, a last vestige of strength to reverse their positions, he needs to win, the stakes are too high to give up – \"Get off him! Stop! Stop!\" Robby's screaming, and he sounds very far away. He sees Kreese standing over them, a shit-eating grin spread across his face, but the man goes out of focus and Miguel realizes he's crying from the pain. \"Is it over?\" Hawk asks, and he stops his strikes. \"I think he's had enough.\" Miguel can't believe it, but he almost sounds concerned. \"It's not over until he admits defeat,\" Kreese says. Miguel rolls his face away so at least he doesn't have to look at Kreese when he says it, and there's Sensei's pile of discarded beer, just inches away from his face, blurring in and out of focus. He blocks out the memory of the two of them together, that time Sensei showed him a block and brought him to the ground, and Miguel panicked about tetanus and Sensei laughed. He can't think of it. Not when Sensei will never be able to teach him again. It's all his fault. Sensei will be so ashamed of him. He hates himself. \"I give up,\" he chokes out, and Hawk releases his neck and sits back on his heels. Miguel curls into a fetal position, and now, he isn't just crying from the pain. \"Miguel,\" Robby's saying, \"I called my dad like ten minutes ago. I'm sorry I told him, but I had to do something. He should be here any second. Okay? Okay? Miguel?\" And as he's saying that, there's the sound of fast, heavy footsteps, and he hears Sensei's voice, calling out his name from the other end of the lot. Kreese turns in the direction of Sensei and his chin raises, like a lion looking up from the carcass it's devouring. And Miguel can see he's pleased. He'd wanted Sensei to come all along. He'd wanted Sensei to see Miguel defeated. Kreese turns back to Miguel as Senei runs to them. \"You're a pussy, just like as I always knew. Look at you, curled up and crying like a baby. Little bitch.\" He kicks his lower back and Miguel does nothing to defend himself, he just curls up even tighter. \"Sensei, look at him. He's had enough –\" Hawk says, nervous. \"And to think, you let the guy who called ICE on your grandma defeat you.\" Miguel's whole world goes suddenly still, and there's a high-pitched ringing in his ears. \" What? \" Hawk shouts. Miguel somehow manages to sit up and drag himself to a stand, and very calmly, he stares at Hawk. He's calmer than he's ever been in his entire life. All the pain he'd felt only seconds before has miraculously disappeared. \"You were the one who called ICE?\" He doesn't recognize his own voice. But of course he was. Hasn't Hawk been going on for months about illegals and taxes and job-stealers? Despite his arrogance only moments before, despite the fact Hawk won, he's terrified. He's stepping back. \"Miguel, it wasn't me, he's just starting shit –\" But it was. It had to be. Miguel reaches down and grabs one of Sensei's littered Coors bottles by the neck. It's still intact, but not for long, because he smashes the base against the gravel, and the lower half shatters. Hawk holds out his hands in supplication. \"Miguel, you have to believe me –\" With supernatural speed, Miguel grabs Hawk's signature blue hair, jerks his head back, and holds the long shards of the broken bottle against his jugular. He presses in so the glass pierces his skin. \"You're dead,\" he says, only now, the fury is back in his voice; it's choked up from the blood and tears streaming down his face. A little more pressure, and Hawk will be dead. He deserves to die. \"Miguel, put the bottle down.\" It's Sensei. He's standing right there, right in front of him. Miguel hesitates. \"He's the one who got Yaya locked up,\" he says, his voice breaking. \"She's going to be deported because of him.\" \"Don't do this,\" Sensei says, his voice firm and commanding. But Miguel doesn't have to listen to him. It would be so easy. All he has to do is strike upwards. He won't even have to do it that hard. And then justice will be served. \"Miguel,\" Hawk whimpers. \"Come on, man! We used to be friends. You have to believe me. I like to rile you up, you know? That's it. That's all it is, just jokes. I don't even really believe that shit, I just like pissing off our sheltered, shallow classmates. I would never actually do that to you! You know me. Come on, please.\" Miguel doesn't believe him. Not by a long shot. But the sound of fear in Hawk's voice sends chills up his spine. And at the mention of friends, he thinks about every time they've goofed off after practice, every stupid text they've shared, every inside joke, every study session. He thinks of the time before Eli transformed into Hawk, after school one day at Dimitri's, when Eli couldn't take the bullying anymore, and he'd cried in front of them. And Sensei is looking at him like no man has ever looked at him before, like he's scared to death. But not for Hawk's sake. For Miguel's. Miguel lets Hawk go and drops the bottle on the ground. His knees give out, his adrenaline gone. \"You fucking psycho!\" Hawk shouts, and Miguel thinks he's shouting at him, until he sees Hawk shove Kreese in the chest. \"Why the fuck would you lie about something like that? Did you want him to kill me?\" Kreese laughs and pats Hawk on the back like it's all a big joke. \"It made for good entertainment. Didn't it, Johnny?\" And Miguel realizes with revolting clarity that Hawk hadn't been lying. He'd nearly killed him, and he hadn't even done it. \"You're sick,\" Sensei is saying, and he's standing in front of his three students, his arms stretched out to the sides to cover all of them, creating a barrier Kreese will have to fight through to get to them. Robby's picking Miguel up, helping him to his feet. \"Well, I might be sick,\" Kreese says, \"but you're done teaching karate forever.\" \"No. You are.\" It's Hawk, but he sounds more like the old Eli. His voice is soft and uncertain, like it used to be last year. And still somehow, speaking those words at all is a new kind of strong. Everyone turns to him. \"What are you on about?\" Kreese demands. The humor has dropped from his voice, so all that remains is the threat under the laughs. \"You're closing the dojo and leaving town forever,\" Hawk says, \"or I'm going to tell the police you did this to me.\" He gestures to his face, which is a wreck. Miguel got his mouth better than he'd thought. \"After everything I've done for you –\" Kreese says, his voice low and gravelly. \"You tried to get me killed a second ago.\" \"It was a joke. You can't take a joke? Don't be a whiny bitch –\" \"If that's your idea of a joke, fuck you. I'm going to the police.\" \"You honestly think they'll believe the lies of some punk kid with stupid hair?\" Kreese scoffs. \"I'll tell them you beat me up, too,\" Miguel says, or tries to. It's hard to speak with a broken nose. \"Corroborating stories from honor roll kids – who do you think they'll believe? Especially when they ask the other Cobras? Think Aisha or anybody else is gonna stand up for you?\" \"I don't think you want to land in jail for child abuse,\" Robby adds, voice cold. \"I hear that doesn't go down so well in prison.\" Kreese ignores the rest of them and turns to his last student, his voice as kind and fatherly as it had been mocking only seconds before. \"Hawk, buddy, don't let these pussies influence you. Come on, man, we had a good thing going. You're like a son to me, you know that, I chose you –\" Hawk stands there silently, his arms crossed. Miguel can see the moment Kreese realizes nothing he can say will change a thing. His face shifts, from paternal, to shocked, to dangerously pissed within the time frame of a second. If the shift hadn't been so sudden, his affection would've been entirely believable. Kreese is the best liar Miguel has ever met. \"Fuck this!\" Kreese shouts. \"Every single one of you is a loser. I'm done with this town. I'm done with you pussies.\" And Kreese turns away, cursing and muttering to himself, kicking up gravel and punching the air, like a toddler in the midst of a tantrum, leaving without even a fight.[Chapter 11] Johnny schools the boys. Carmen schools Johnny. Johnny's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. Chapter Eleven: Stupid \"Stupid, stupid, stupid!\" Johnny slams his open palm against the steering wheel in time with each word, pounding out with the angry passion of a hair metal drummer. \"All three of you boys are stupid. Except you, Robby. You're only half stupid. Next time, instead of calling me after it's too late, don't be a dumbass to begin with. Hear that?\" \"You're really getting better at compliments, Dad,\" Robby deadpans. Johnny whips his neck to the shotgun seat of his car and glares at his kid, even though a part of him appreciates Robby's attempts at keeping things light. There's nothing light about it, though. Boys . Was he ever that idiotic when he was a kid? He thinks about the time he and the other Cobras pushed Daniel on his bike down a steep incline, and the unfortunate answer is yes. Yes, he was. So he doesn't technically have a right to be scolding them, but that sure as hell isn't stopping him. He's irate and relieved, and irate that the relief is getting in the way of him going ape shit on these kids. He needs to be angry enough that they'll be too scared out of their minds to do anything like this ever again. When did he become the person on the other end of this conversation? At what point did he turn into the lame adult who shows up useless and too late at the end of the movie, like in Home Alone and The Goonies ? \"What were you two thinking, fighting like that? This isn't one of your stupid video games. You don't get to start over when you die. You just die.\" Hawk, the little shit, is doing his best to look bored out of his mind by Johnny's lecture, pretending like he isn't traumatized. For all Johnny knows, he isn't. From the rearview mirror, Johnny can see him wiggling a loose tooth with his tongue. But he can't be too angry at him, not after he stood up to Kreese. Something Johnny hadn't been able to do for years. Miguel at least looks shame-faced. \"You have no excuse to resort to that level of violence in a planned match. That type of fighting is for life or death situations only. What were you thinking?\" And now he's repeating himself. \"Sensei, I had to defend you,\" Miguel answers firmly. Which is somehow so childish and so mature at the same time that Johnny doesn't know whether he wants to slap some sense into him or give him a hug. Probably both. Hawk shrugs. \"To be honest, I just wanted to let off steam. I didn't think it would go that far, though.\" His tooth pops out of his mouth and lands somewhere in the pile of fast-food trash on the floor of Johnny's car. Hawk stares at Miguel for a second, face unreadable, and Johnny's ready to abruptly pull over and stop another fight, until Hawk lets out a chuckle. \"Think the Tooth Fairy will give me a dollar?\" Whatever animosity was between them (okay, hatred), Hawk is throwing away with a friendly shoulder nudge to his companion in the back seat – the same guy who knocked out that tooth. Miguel curls up the corner of his mouth, half pleased with himself, half accepting Hawk's olive branch. Still mistrusting. \"You were pretty badass,\" Hawk continues as he wipes the blood off his mouth. \"Seriously, a broken bottle? That was a vintage street move right there. I guess you are a Jet all the way.\" After a moment of hesitation, Miguel shoulders him back. \"Damn it, Hawk, I was trying to suppress that memory. Now I'm never going to get that song out my head.\" \"That wasn't even the worst part. When Wendy Sanders sang I Feel Pretty , I felt suicidal.\" Johnny shakes his head, astonished and possibly a bit disgusted. \"Are you two seriously discussing a high school musical at a time like this?\" \"Um…\" Miguel says. \"Yes?\" \"Hawk, you're spitting out teeth. Miguel, I just set your goddamn nose.\" Johnny shakes his head. \"Natural selection is lie.\" Robby laughs, but he pinches his lips together in a firm, serious line when Johnny shoots over another glare. \"You are not exempt from my wrath either, buddy.\" He points at him and accidentally speeds through a red light. \"You're grounded.\" \"That's not fair! I called you!\" \"And that's why you're only grounded for the weekend instead of the rest of your life.\" \"Sensei, you missed my turn,\" Hawk announces. At least he called him Sensei. o - o - o - o - o He drops off Hawk and waits for him to get inside, and like a coward, he is quietly grateful for the fact Hawk has his own set of keys and there are no hysterical parents waiting at the door. Johnny doesn't have the energy to deal with another delusional mom who thinks her precious baby can do no wrong. Now that his business has been on the straight and narrow at Miyagi-do, with signed permission slips and release of liability forms and other bullshit, Johnny actually has to deal with parents. After dental work and attitude adjustment, Hawk's going to be just fine. He's cooling down some, and even though he's still pissed at the boys, he's proud of them too. Not that he'd admit it. He's proud of Robby, for coming to him when he needed him. He's proud of Miguel, for standing up for him, for reining in his rage, showing mercy, even when the kid was certain his opponent had done the most heinous thing imaginable. And he's proud of Hawk, for seeing straight after a couple months when it took Johnny years to acknowledge the truth about Kreese. o - o - o - o - o He opens the door before she even has a chance to pound on it. He's been up waiting for this, hanging out on his sofa flipping through infomercials and true crime late night TV, pretending like he wasn't looking out the window, watching the slits between the blinds turn from black to blue to pink to white as he waited for her, a tight knot in his gut. \"I'm sorry,\" he says and the slap stings his face before the words can finish leaving his mouth. Her eyes are bloodshot and she hasn't changed from her scrubs. \"How much more does my boy have to take?\" she growls. She grabs him by the front of his t-shirt and throttles him, and the door rattles as he smacks against it. \"How many times do I have to come home to him like this before I realize the problem is you?\" A sob escapes her throat and it takes everything inside him to look at her, to face this. \"He was fine before you came along. Fine. And you,\" she shoves him, \"you taught him to fight. You taught him to be angry. You, with your outdated, toxic macho bullshit. I trusted you. His nose is broken, his whole face is black and blue, he hasn't even finished healing from last time, and I can't take him to the hospital because I don't trust CPS not to steal him from me.\" \"Carmen, \" Johnny whispers, throat catching, \"you're right, you're right. I'm so sorry.\" \"You're sorry? You're going to be sorry!\" Shit, he has to hold it together. He can't show her that her angry tears are destroying him. That he'd get down on his knees and beg her to forgive him if it would do any good. \"I failed him,\" he says. \"I tried to protect him, but I failed him.\" That catches her off guard, and for a second, her fury disappears, leaving only the motherly terror that ignited it. She releases his t-shirt, but her crossed arms are only mildly better. He did this. He caused her pain. He caused Miguel's pain, if you stepped back and looked the dominos. \"What happened this time?\" she asks. The anger is still there, rumbling under a new layer of doubt. \"He only told me he got in another fight. I wanted to let him rest, so I didn't, I didn't press him.\" Johnny sighs, pulls a hand through his hair. \"It wasn't just another fight. Do you want to come in?\" Carmen's jaw is clenched and she's glaring at him, but eventually she gives him a terse nod. He makes her a cup of coffee, stale Folgers from yesterday that he reheats in the microwave. She's sitting on the sofa, her arms folded over her waist. When he hands the coffee to her, she makes a disgusted face and leaves the cup untouched in the center of his coffee table, next to, unfortunately, a spread-open copy of the latest Victoria Secret catalogue, addressed to the previous resident. He's never felt like more of a loser. \"I can make a fresh cup –\" \"Just explain,\" she snaps. Johnny doesn't bother to sit down. He couldn't remain still even if he did sit, so he paces. \"Miguel fought without my permission,\" he begins, \"trust me, I'd forbidden him, and I thought I'd gotten through to him. But even if I told him not to, he fought for my sake. So it's my fault. I take responsibility –\" \"What do you mean he fought for your sake?\" Carmen interrupts. \"I don't know if he told you much about what was going on at Cobra Kai, with Kreese –\" \"He said your old instructor was teaching there, and that you had 'artistic differences' which is why you combined dojos with another instructor. I assumed there was more to the story, but to be honest, I've had a lot on my plate, and no time to worry about something as trivial as local karate politics.\" Johnny swallows. \"It's bigger than that. Kreese, turns out he owned the Cobra Kai name or whatever. I got a lawyer – it doesn't matter. The point is, I couldn't get rid of him. I didn't even own my dojo anymore. I hate that man, but I stayed at first because…\" he pauses, straining for a diplomatic way of skirting the truth. \"Because I don't agree with his teaching methods.\" It's a cop ou. \"What is that supposed to mean?\" Carmen demands. Johnny's pacing is growing faster. \"I didn't want to leave him alone with the kids. He taught me when I was their age, and he's…he's harsh.\" \"Harsh?\" Johnny squeezes his eyes shut and forces out the word. \"Abusive.\" There's an indiscernible noise – a hitch in her breath, perhaps. He opens his eyes and stares at her, forcing himself to admit it. She deserves the truth; it's her son who got hurt. \"He was a sadistic asshole then, and he's a sadistic asshole now. He's not even physical with the kids anymore, but he… he messes with their minds. He's fucking poison – pushes them too hard, turns them against each other…\" Johnny can't hide his shame. He feels his shoulders slumping and he knows he looks pathetic, sounds pathetic. He'd told LaRusso his story, but he hadn't used wimpy, whiner words like abuse. Abuse is for victims, and he's not a victim. He doesn't want Carmen to think he's some helpless loser, or that he ever was. He can't stand for a beautiful, strong woman to sit there on his couch with her arms crossed and look at him like he's weak. \"I thought if I stayed, I could protect the kids,\" he says, and he knows he's talking too fast, repeating himself, rambling. \"I was wrong. So me and LaRusso opened up the new dojo together. Which was working fine until Kreese threatened me. He promised to leave Cobra Kai alone if Miguel beat another boy. He was just using Miguel to get to me, because he knows… he knows Miguel's my favorite. I made Miguel promise he wouldn't fight. Obviously he didn't listen. And I got there too late.\" God, he wishes he could skip past this excruciating moment of starched silence. He wishes she would get back to screaming at him, storm out in a rage. It's better than not knowing what she's thinking. It's better than her quietly judging him as less than a man. \"We can't make decisions for them, can we?\" she asks at last. She sighs, and then her words are firm. \"Miggy chose to fight, defying both of us and putting himself in danger. He's sixteen. He knows better. His anger has been out of control lately, for good reason, but… His behavior is out of line and he'll hear from me when I get home. I promise you that.\" \"Don't go too hard on him.\" Johnny finds himself immediately defending his student before his brain can catch up. \"He had good intentions. He's a good kid. Every boy his age makes dumb decisions. Besides, it's still my fault. He would have never met Kreese if it weren't for me. Don't blame him.\" Carmen gives him a long, hard look. Eventually, she turns away. \"Don't blame yourself. You're not responsible for Kreese's actions. And when your past comes back to haunt you, you face it. That's what you did.\" He knows she's not only talking about Kreese here, but her own ex-husband. He can bet she's had to give herself that speech a lot lately. She stands, grabs her purse from the coffee table, and takes a moment to smirk at the catalogue spread, where a model dressed in a turquoise-sequined bra and thong set looks more like her than Johnny cares to admit. She seems more amused than offended, though. So at least he's spared a lecture about objectification or some shit like that. She probably hates him for putting Miguel in danger, even if her tone has turned understanding. Or in that case, maybe she doesn't hate him, but pities him for what he's implied about him and Kreese, which is so much worse. They pause at the doorway, both trying to come up with the least awkward way of saying goodbye. \"Look, I care about Miguel,\" Johnny forces out. \"Like I care about Robby. Like he's my own kid. I know you think I'm a bad influence, but I tried to look after him. But I get it, if you don't want me around anymore. Trust me, I get it.\" \"I know you care about him,\" Carmen says. She looks him straight in the eyes. \"And that's a hell of a lot more than I've learned to expect from most men. It means a lot to me – what you do for Miguel.\" After the weight of a serious statement, Carmen gives him a mischievous smile that does a decent job of hiding the strain she's under. \"I'm sorry for slapping you, by the way.\" Johnny grins, a little crookedly, and tries to ease the tension with humor. \"You can slap me anytime you want.\" She's not saying anything. Her face is unreadable. Yeah, that did not go over well. And now he probably is going to hear that objectifying lecture. \"Never mind,\" he says quickly. \"It was a stupid joke.\" \"Was it?\" \"Yeah it was, okay? Stupid. Sorry,\" he shoots out, defensive. He's a fifty-year-old man and somehow she's managing to make him feel embarrassed over a dumb, crude one-liner. She didn't seem like a prude, but whatever. He gets it. He's not with the times anymore, not that he cares. \"No. Not was it stupid? . I meant, was it a joke?\" And she's standing too close to him. He can see her gulp. He can see her pupils washing out those dark brown irises, staring up at him. She smells good, that faint wisp of coconut shampoo, the coils of her ringlets falling to her shoulders, a visible impression where her hairband held it back for the twelve long hours of her shift. He doesn't care that her mascara is smeared, or that she's wearing scrubs and sneakers, or that the bags under her eyes prove she's as weary and sleep-deprived as he is. He wants her. And he knows she wants him. He doesn't know how she could, when he's acted so weak, exposing his emotions and failures. But she does. He closes the last inch between them, cups the base of her head in the palm of his hand, and leans into her. Before he can even finish leaning in to kiss her, she meets him there, and the door rattles as she wraps her arms around his shoulders and he steps off balance. When they stop to catch their breaths, an idiot grin spreads across his face, and he sees his own happiness reflected back in her. He tucks her hair behind her ear and leans in for another. He's not thinking about how this will go over with Robby and Miguel. He's not thinking about how uncomfortable it will be later, if Carmen decides this is a one-time thing. He's not thinking about how he will probably ruin it. He's not thinking about the consequences. He's not thinking. It's definitely not a joke, but it sure is stupid. There are worse things than being stupid, though.[Chapter 12] Family night at the LaRusso house gains a few new members. Daniel's POV, third person limited. Disclaimer: I don't own The Karate Kid or Cobra Kai. I'm not making money from this. I'm just a fan. A/N: Thank you so much for following this story. I appreciate every comment. It's been a fun experience, and I'm sad it's almost over. The last chapter will be posted next Wednesday, although there's a good chance I'll write a \"Season 3\" sequel. Chapter Twelve: Family Night \"God, I can't believe we have to do this,\" Anthony whines. He throws his chest dramatically down on the dining table. \"Well, you do,\" Daniel says, voice firm. \"For once, I agree with Anthony,\" Sam grumbles. She drops her chin into her palm. \"Aisha wanted to go to the movies tonight. And I'm stuck here.\" Amanda and Daniel exchange a look, and he knows his wife's not up for it either, but she being a trooper. \"Seriously Dad, Sunday family nights? What are we, Mormon?\" Anthony says. \"Next you're going to be fitting us in magic underwear.\" \"Let's just try it this once. That's all I'm asking. If it's horrible, we'll go back to living as strangers in the same house.\" Dramatic , Sam mouths to Amanda and he sees Amanda nod at their daughter. Alexa is off, every family member's phone is in a fruit bowl on top of the fridge, out of reach and on vibrate. Daniel heads over to the kitchen counter and scoops out the homemade ice cream from the ice cream maker. It's chocolate chip pistachio, which he thinks, after secretly observing his son these past few days, are some of Anthony's favorite flavors. It's honestly hard to guess Anthony's favorite foods, since he eats everything indiscriminately. He's had too little time for his family since opening Miyagi-do, and Anthony's got the brunt of it. At least Amanda is with him at work, and Sam is with him at the dojo. On Monday, when Anthony'd sarcastically pretended not to know who he was, Daniel had realized that he was falling into the same old schema of putting Anthony on the back-burner. Because it was easier, because his son has always been so damn difficult, because a thousand other things needed to be addressed, because Anthony would finally shut up when he played his video games. He's an obnoxious, entitled, spoiled brat. And a kid doesn't get like that without a parent's contribution. Or in Daniel's case, a lack of contribution. So Sunday evenings are family nights. Even if not a single one of them wants to be there. Including himself. He starts scooping out bowls of ice cream for everyone while Amanda is reading the instructions to the board game, her eyebrow cocked in ironic amusement. He's lucky she's humoring him. \" Mice and Mystics. That sounds stupid,\" Anthony says. He tosses a die up and down in his hand. \"It's a role-playing game,\" Daniel says as he drops the bowl of ice cream in front of his son. \"You like role-playing games.\" \"Yeah, online.\" Anthony shovels a huge scoop into his mouth, and it's kind of grotesque. \"Hey Dad, this is surprisingly not horrible,\" he says with his mouth full. \"Gee, thanks,\" Daniel answers, rolling his eyes. But then a second later, \"Wait, did you make this because pistachio's my favorite? I didn't know you knew.\" And Daniel doesn't know whether he's ashamed of his past failures, or proud of his recent effort. Probably ashamed. He's always known Samantha's favorites. And he's always made a point of making them for her. He's going to do better now. \"Of course I knew, buddy,\" Daniel lies. Anthony shrugs and downs another scoop. Amanda starts explaining the rules and Sam is setting up the board. Anthony is playing with two of the mice figurines, and Daniel is fairly sure his eleven-year-old son is putting them inappropriate poses, 69ing the mice right there at the table. \"Hey, I want to be the bad-ass thief mouse,\" Anthony interrupts as Amanda goes over the character descriptions. \"I wanted to be thief,\" Samantha complains. \"I called it first!\" \"Are you two kidding me?\" Amanda says, slamming down the rule book. \"Sam, you're seventeen. It's a board game with mice .\" Sam at least looks shamefaced. \"Fine,\" she says. \"I'll be the healer, Tilda or whatever.\" \"Obviously your father is the wise, magical Gandalf mouse,\" Amanda says. \"Thanks, sweetie,\" Daniel says, smugly. He takes a bite of ice cream. \"I'm glad you recognize the ancient wisdom and sacred traditions I'm passing down.\" He says it sardonically, but he kind of means it, too. \"Oh, don't thank me. I just said that because you're old,\" Amanda teases. o - o - o - o - o They're hilariously awful at the game. They keep forgetting the rules, and arguing over them, and it's been an hour and the cockroaches keep defeating them and they haven't gotten past the first chapter. They're actually having fun. To the surprise of them all. Daniel doesn't have to use his stern voice once, which is good, because he sucks at it. (Admittedly, he's getting better at it.) Sam and Anthony are clashing their figures together, pretending they're in the midst of a light saber fight when a sharp pounding shakes the front door. \"Seriously?\" Daniel groans. \"I'll get it,\" Amanda says. \"It's okay, I got it.\" Daniel's knees actually hurt when he gets up – he's really getting old, isn't he? – and he makes his way to the front door begrudgingly. If it's another Jehovah's Witness or a political canvasser, Mr. Miyagi is going to be very disappointed in how he's about to use his karate. \"Johnny?\" Daniel says. And this can't mean anything good, him showing up like this again, looking drained. At least he can't smell alcohol on him. \"What are you doing here? You couldn't have called first?\" he asks as he opens the door, even though that's probably not a terribly considerate thing to say. \"I called ten times,\" Johnny snaps. \"Then Robby called Sam and Amanda and nobody answered.\" And then Daniel remembers the phones on top of the fridge, and the Motown they'd started blaring halfway through the game. There's no way they'd hear a vibrate. Johnny doesn't give him time to explain though. \"Robby started getting all worried so here we are – you know kids these days, with their dyslexic anxiety or whatever.\" \" Robby was worried, huh?\" Daniel says with a lifted eyebrow. \"This is more of an in-person sorta conversation, anyway, so it's good we dropped in on our way to uh…dinner,\" Johnny answers, carefully skirting Daniel's attempt at getting him to admit an iota of concern. \"Glad to see you're not dead.\" \"Coming from you, that's practically a compliment.\" Daniel smirks. And by his shifty-eyed stance, there was absolutely no way Johnny was on his way to dinner. Johnny Lawrence was actually worried about him. The world is a strange place indeed. \"We're having a family night. Cell phones are off.\" Johnny's mouth curls into a grin. \"Family night? What a bunch of dorks.\" \"Do you want to come in?\" \"The boys are in the car, and I don't want to interrupt,\" Johnny says. \"But the reason I was calling… Kreese is gone. For good. I thought you should know. He left town last night.\" Johnny pulls his hand through his hair. Instinctually, Daniel checks it. His knuckles are untouched. So he didn't beat the man out of town. \"So, uh…I'm gonna go. Have fun with your kids.\" Johnny turns to leave, as if he didn't just give Daniel life-altering good news, and Daniel grabs his arm. \"Wait!\" Daniel exclaims. \"Hold up. How is that possible? Are you sure he's gone? For good?\" Johnny nods. \"For good.\" Daniel's mind is churning with flashing images of the man who turned vulnerable kids into menacing bullies, who manipulated him against Mr. Miyagi and psychologically screwed him up just to get revenge over a trophy. The man Johnny used to idolize, the man who choked out his star pupil over second place. He thinks about his past, and he thinks about the kids in the Valley and he's overwhelmed with relief. Daniel may have looked wimpy growing up, but he always had to come up to bat, always had to face his enemies head on to feel any sense of closure. He never shied away from conflict, even the fights he couldn't win. And as much as he still wants to punch the lights of Kreese, as much as he wants to be (and expected to be) the champion in another bad guy show-down, now that it's over, he's okay with the fact it never came to that. More than okay. For the first time, Daniel doesn't feel the need to be the hero. He's just glad the man's gone. He's glad that he can find some peace. That Johnny can find some peace. Maybe this is what Mr. Miyagi was trying to teach him all along. Daniel tries to gather his thoughts, control the surge of surprise and joy that's telling him to pull Johnny into a hug. Fuck it. He throws his arms around Johnny anyway. \"That's great, man. That's great.\" Johnny pats his back awkwardly and pulls out of the hug. \"Yeah, it was crazy. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow.\" \"No. No way. Tell the boys to come in. Honey!\" Daniel calls behind his shoulder. \"We've got company!\" Johnny shrugs, even though Daniel can tell he wants to come in, and waves his hand to the boys in the car. As Robby and Miguel make their way to front door, Daniel cringes. \"Christ. He fought Hawk, didn't he?\" \"That stubborn idiot doesn't listen,\" Johnny groans, but Daniel can hear the affection beneath the annoyance. Miguel looks worse the closer up he gets. And Daniel can't help but flicker through more flashbacks to his own teenage years – the boy in the secondhand clothes, the kid from the wrong side of the block with the wrong accent and wrong skin tone. Miguel's eyes shift nervously from Johnny to Daniel, and Daniel puts a hand on his shoulder. \"Kid, you've gotta stop showing up to my house looking like this.\" Miguel quirks his mouth up in something that's almost a smile. \"I'll try not to bleed out on your sofa this time.\" Daniel squeezes his shoulder and pulls him in to a tentative half-hug, and surprisingly, Miguel accepts it. \"You gotta take better care of yourself. Now get on in there and eat some ice cream,\" he says as he shoves Miguel through the door. Robby tucks his hair behind his ear, shy and embarrassed. Halting the affection he's grown to show him whenever his father's in sight. \"Hey, Mr. LaRusso.\" \"Please tell me you didn't have anything to do with this, did you Robby?\" Daniel asks, Jersey accent coming out full force at the start of a parental scolding. \"I saved the day,\" Robby jokes. \"If by saving the day you mean calling my dad to come save our asses.\" \"Come here.\" Daniel opens up his arms, in the warm, easy-going affection that comes naturally to him, and that Robby's used to be so resistant to in the beginning. After a moment's hesitation, the boy steps into his arms and squeezes him back, and it strikes Daniel as odd that it doesn't strike him as odd that he's just hugged Johnny Lawrence, his prized student, and his son back to back. That they're joining the LaRussos for family night. That in some odd twist of fate, the word family isn't too much of stretch. Amanda enters the room and skids to a halt, taking in Miguel's face in horror. \"Is that kid's nose broken?\" \"Oh, don't worry,\" Johnny says as he wrestles Miguel's hair and shoves past him into the house. He doesn't bother to take his shoes off. \"I popped it back into place last night.\" o - o - o - o - o Daniel's leaning against the countertop, watching over everyone as he waits for the kettle to whistle. He's already taken out the tins of matcha powder, loose-leaf rooibos for Amanda, and English Breakfast for Johnny. He can't imagine Johnny drinking tea, but he'd shrugged his shoulders when Daniel offered. Robby's playing Fortnite with Anthony, and it warms Daniel to see how well they're finally getting along. They're leaning in toward the TV as if they were engaged in real-life action and shooting insults at each other over their shoulders, which Daniel instinctually wants to correct, but they seem to be having a good time with it, insults and all. Robby's a good kid, seventeen years old and taking the time out to play with a chubby middle schooler. Johnny and Amanda are hanging out at the dining table, which still bears the ruins of the board game. He doesn't know what they're talking about, but Amanda is laughing and rolling her eyes, so Johnny has probably said something so absurdly bigoted and out of touch that there's nothing you can really do but laugh. He's not pleased about Samantha and Miguel, off in their own little corner, Miguel perched up on the arm of an easy chair, Sam leaning on the wall beside him. They're talking quietly to themselves, and he doesn't approve of the way they're looking at each other, like they're the only people in the room. She reaches out a hand to trace the blue bruise spreading from the center of his face and the now slightly crooked bridge of his nose. He can't believe that boy took his daughter to Golf n' Stuff, it's too surreal. What were the odds that Miguel would take his daughter exactly where he took Ali all those years ago? Only two months ago, Daniel would've forbidden Sam to even speak to Miguel, but now… He's not happy about it. But he wouldn't be happy about any guy looking at his little girl like that. Johnny's updated him on what's going on at Miguel's home, and the kid has it rough. Daniel was too much of a hothead himself for meditation in the beginning, so he can overlook that hiccup. Miguel's okay. Daniel takes the kettle off the burner and pours the tea. At the comforting scent of matcha, there's a small pang of grief that Mr. Miyagi isn't here to see this. He feels like he's come so far in such a short amount of time. He'd been so wrapped up in his business, in his obsession with finances and success, that he'd forgotten about the importance of the small things – hanging out with his wife and kids on the weekend, the casual comfort of friends stopping by uninvited. He carries the cups over to the table and takes a seat. Johnny takes a gulp and makes a face. \"I offered you an espresso instead, you know.\" \"This is fine,\" Johnny says. \"I'm taking etiquette lessons from Amanda.\" He pokes out his pinky and Daniel chuckles. \"I'm not sure I make the best Miss Manners,\" Amanda says. \"I've been known to add tequila to my tea.\" Watching his wife and his former rival/ enemy/ current business partner/ friend-thing banter, Daniel's relief is palpable. He's drawn away from the moment by the sheer overwhelming sense of contentment. He hadn't realized it, but in these past few years, an underlying sense of doom had been creeping up on him, a feeling that'd never fully surfaced because he'd kept himself so busy. Underneath his salesmanship and his cheery smile and his constant pushing for more out of life, was a fear the world would hurt his kids, that everything he'd built would fall apart. Truth is, the world's still as brutal as it's always been, even with Kreese out of the picture. This one small win doesn't make the existential dread of parenthood disappear. It doesn't save the planet. But it renews Daniel's faith anyway. He can make the world a better place. Even if it's just in his household, in his dojo, in the Valley. There's a shout from the other end of the room and Daniel tenses. Already, something has happened to destroy his brief moment of peace. He turns, and sees the shouting is Miguel on his phone, speaking fast in Spanish and gesturing dramatically. The boy rushes to his feet and jumps up and down as he screams, his fragile condition forgotten. And the relief returns, because it's not a shout of pain or danger, it's a shout of victory. Some private victory Daniel knows nothing about. Miguel clicks the phone off and says something quietly to Daniel's daughter. She wraps her arms around him and they're celebrating together. Johnny's standing up, pushing his chair back with the back of his knees. Miguel sees his sensei move toward him from over Sam's shoulder. Tears of joy are streaming down his cheeks. He shouts something to Johnny – Daniel doesn't even think the kid knows he's still speaking Spanish, he's so overcome, but Johnny seems to get it, and runs to the boy. Daniel, as removed as he is from the situation, feels a vicarious joy at another victory. It doesn't matter that the victory isn't his. What matters is that Johnny pulls Miguel into an embrace, lifting the kid off his feet (which has to hurt, considering the state he's in). What matters is his daughter catches him looking at her, and instead of shooting him a frustrated glare, she smiles, and her eyes crinkle, so he knows it's real. What matters is that Robby and Anthony have abandoned the controllers and are roughhousing, and Anthony's laughing at the top of his lungs as Robby demonstrates over-dramatic karate moves and they knock over the papasan chair. What matters is Amanda takes his hand under the table and moves it onto her lap, giving it a gentle squeeze. They're both wisecrackers, so sarcastic with each other that sometimes they forget the importance of tender moments that require no irony. Daniel puts his arm around Amanda, and everything is right with the world. Or at least, everything is right with his world. And that's enough.

SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. It was a dark, stormy night when I first met Hansel and Gretel. I was out in the woods that surrounded my mother's home when I first saw them. Me, being a meager eleven year old, didn't know that they were going to expose my mother for who- or should I put it more accurately- what , she was. I gave them only a sliver of my attention, seeing as how I was busy trying to hunt down the ever elusive starberry, something that mother put extra emphasis into when she told me what to gather. I knew of a small patch that was full of the hard to get berries, only it was past sight of my home. I paused. Dare I risk the dangerous journey? Even though I was half witch, half human, I decided to chance it. Despite the fact that the full moon was covered by dark, stormy clouds that looked angry, I began the short (by my standards) trek towards the starberry patch. I reached it, smiling when I saw that the bright yellow berries were in full bloom. I began to pick the berries, humming a little song as I did so. I popped a starberry into my mouth, giggling as the flavor blossomed in my mouth, spreading its delicious taste down into my belly. I continued to eat starberries as I quickly filled up my basket with the desserts-like berries. Once the basket was full, I turned and began to trek back towards my home. I ignored the nighttime sounds, only concentrating on my song as I lugged the by-now heavy basket back to my little home in the woods. I paused when I reached the clearing that served as our front yard. I could've sworn that I heard something… I shrugged and continued on. I reached the front door and pushed it open. I dropped the basket full of starberries, the brightly colored treats rolling across the floor as I screamed in horror. My mother had been decapitated and her fear filled eyes were staring straight at me as the man and woman who killed her turned towards me. I turned and fled, only I didn't get very far. I barely reached the woods when strong arms wrapped themselves around my waist and hosted me up, shrieking angrily at the two people who had killed my only family. \"What is your name, child?\" asked the woman as she brought her lantern closer to my face to examine me better. I could only whimper in fear as the man carried me away from my home. With every step he took, the weaker I grew until I was naught more than a rag doll. \"My sister asked you for your name,\" rumbled the man as I sobbed into his chest. \"Now if I were you, I'd answer her.\" \"Are you threatening me?\" I snapped at him, my anger for them growing. \"No, I'm just warning you,\" he answered me cheekily as I growled. My long, thick mane of unruly curls whipped across my face as I was half carried, half dragged by the man. \"How long has the witch held you captive?\" demanded the woman as we made our way towards the small city where I would go to buy things like bread and milk. \"All my life, and she isn't a witch!\" I protested, feeling my strong anger return. \"And who may she be?\" asked the man as we came into sight of town hall. But I just pressed my lips together and looked elsewhere. \"Hansel, Gretel! Welcome back! I trust that you've slain the witch?\" boomed the mayor, who was surrounded by townsfolk. Most of them I recognized. The baker who would slip my an extra pastries whenever I would enter his shop; the fisherman who would tweak my nose and ask how my day was going; the bookseller who would always have a new book for me to read… The man in answer head up the bag with my mother's head in it and tossed it to the mayor, who caught it and pulled out her head. I began to scream with fury at the sight of her face, with those eyes that I would always look into before I fell asleep, that mouth that would kiss me and sing me lullabies; those cracked cheeks that I would trace over whenever I sat in her lap… Never again. \"Fuck it, put the damn thing away, won't you?\" snapped Hansel upon my uproar. I bit his hand before raking my fingernails down his face and spinning to the side. I managed to punch his sister before I was detained by a bleeding Hansel once more. \"Shit, she can fight!\" gasped Gretel, her hand on her eye as she stumbled over to me and bent down to eye level. I just spat in her face and called her every fowl name I could think of. \"Listen, listen, shhh… it's alright, she can't hurt you, it's alright…\" Hansel soothed me before I collapsed against him, my energy spent on trying to get away or showing them just how much I hated them \"She's been brainwashed, there's no telling how long the witch had her as her prisoner,\" announced Gretel as I glared up at her. \"Hold on a moment!\" I turned my head as the bookkeeper spoke up, approaching from the crowd. I bent down so that he was at eye level with me and tucked an escaped curl behind my ear. \"How do you do, Miss Selena?\" I burst out into a fresh round of tears as Hansel awkwardly restrained me, causing for the kindly old man who sold books to put two and two together. He had been the only person in the small city to go to the university and graduate with honors. \"She was your mother, wasn't she?\" he whispered quietly so that only the four of us could hear it. I paused before shutting my eyes and nodding. Seal my fate. I saw the bookkeeper exchanging looks with Hansel and Gretel before he stood and walked stiffly over to where his daughters were standing. Hansel and Gretel also exchanged looks. Now the main question was… What to do with me?[Chapter 2] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. In the end, Hansel and Gretel decided to help me. Not that I was happy with being spared of being burned at the stake- I was. But then, I was also angry at my mother's killers. So I was taking every excuse I had to get them a hard time of getting me cleaned up. Like for example: When Gretel tried to scrub me down with soap, I splashed water at her, getting the soap in her eyes. \"Fuck it- can't you see that we're the good guys?\" she yelled, storming out of the wash room, leaving me alone to my own devices. After waiting for half an hour and letting the steaming water go cold, I decided to wash myself. After my first bath in a long time, I wrapped myself in a towel and sat down on the floor to sulk over my capture. Balling my fist up into my mouth to stop any sounds from leaking out, I began to cry again. \"Mother…\" I mumbled around my hand, fingering her many necklaces that I always wore with the other; they never rusted, or fell apart, I only realized about two years ago that she used magic to forge them around my neck. I heard the door open again; I didn't turn to acknowledge who it was, even when I was scooped off the wooden floor and carried into the room that the twins shared. He set me onto a bed and nodded towards a chair that was next to the roaring fireplace. I saw that it had a dress on it- more importantly, one of my dresses from the small cottage that I occupied with mother. He left to give me privetcy and I stood, letting the towel fall from my body as I slowly got dressed. Once I was presentable, I walked over to the door that led out into the hallway of the inn where they were staying and pushed open the door. I almost stepped into a tray full of delicious smelling food. After looking down the hallway for anyone, I pulled the tray inside and inspected it, using my inner sight to see if there was anything poisoned, which there wasn't. in fact if anything, the food was spiced with herbs and made my mouth water. I found myself giving into my sudden hunger pains as I took a small loaf of bread that was packed with nuts and retreated to under the bed to slowly pick the bread apart devour it. I had retreated four more times; for a bowl of soup, an entire plate of chicken, and a small cake. I was licking the chocolate off my palms when Hansel and Gretel reentered the room. I hid under the bed, praying that they wouldn't spot me and assume that I left. No such luck there. \"I know you're under the bed, Selena,\" called out Gretel as I saw her boots cross the room and halt a few feet away from the bed. \"So what if I am?\" I saw both twins jump as my voice sounded from behind them. They spun around, but of course, I wasn't there. \"Nice,\" whistled Hansel, clearly impressed by my ventriloquism trick. Gretel scoffed as she leaned down to peak under the bed. \"Yup, she's still here!\" she called out, reaching under the bed to grab me. I let her, knowing that either one wouldn't hurt me. \"Were you hungry?\" she murmured, placing me onto the bed so that she could braid my hair. I only shrugged my shoulders as I felt her brushing my hair with my hairbrush. She or Hansel must've returned to the cottage and gathered up my things before coming back to the city to \"nurse\" me back to health. I had always been on the small scale, even when I was just a baby. At first, mother worried for my health, but as I got older, she relaxed and simply accepted the fact that I would always be tinier than average. I heard Gretel mutter as my messy braid became undone, letting ten feet of glorious red and old streaked black curls flow down my back, onto the bed and brush the floor. I whimpered and used my hair as a curtain to hide my face, which amused Hansel to no end and back again. \"It looks like she's never cut it,\" mused Hansel, taking a curl into his heavily callused hand and rubbing the softness against his fingers. \"I daren't cut it,\" I whispered. \"Why not?\" asked Hansel, curious with my story. I raised my hand and dosed the candles, plunging the room into sudden darkness before singing. \" Flowers gleam and glow, Let your powers shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine Heal the past and hurts Change the fate's design Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine What once was mine \" As I sang that song, the streak running throughout my hair began to glow, illumining the room with its brightness. I heard Hansel grunt and drop the lock he was holding, but my hair had already healed his scarred hand. I reached out yet again and relit the candles with a finger before retreating back into myself. \"She is defiantly a witch,\" I heard Gretel state to her brother. \"She could help us!\" mused Hansel. \"Here me out, Gretel- she's already starting to trust us- it's not much, but it's a start.\" \"You're fucking kidding me, aren't you?\" muttered Gretel. \"I'm not going to play baby sitter!\" \"And nobody's asking you too, but if we had an actual witch on our side, think of how many more witches we could kill!\" I squinted my eyes so that I could see their auras better. I saw that they hadn't know that their last kill was a mother; if they had known, then they would've gone about their killing differently, but how so, they didn't know. It was then that I realized that my eyes were closing. I finally gave into sleep as I cuddled down into the blankets to sleep. I would decide what I wanted to do with mother's murders in the morning.[Chapter 3] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. The following afternoon, when I woke up, I saw that Hansel and Gretel were packing up. \"Where are you going?\" I asked them shyly, sitting up n bed and hugging my knees to my chest as I watched them with curiosity. \"We are going to our next job,\" answered Gretel grimly, checking her crossbow with an expert eye. \"And you're coming along with us. Now pack up.\" Scrambled out of bed, noticing that someone (I suspected it was Hansel) had all my clothes washed and folded neatly inside a saddle bag. The only things that were out were a pair of riding trousers and a simple blouse, along with my favorite red velvet cloak, scuffed up leather boots and my belt with my money purse, sling shot and bag of pebbles paying next to it. I went into the washroom to get dressed, leaving behind my trusty slingshot, figuring that the bounty hunters would like to examine it. Sure enough, when I came out of the washroom, I saw that Gretel was incorrectly trying to draw it. \"Give it,\" I ordered her gruffly as she tossed it to me. I quickly gave her a demonstration of how to load, aim and fire before sticking my only weapon into my belt. \"Can you ride?\" asked Gretel as the three of us approached the stables. I fought the urge to roll my eyes and spit out something nasty at her. Instead, I nodded my head. I learned to ride from the mayor's carriage driver, who bred full blood horses. \"Good, because in the next town, you and Hansel and go and look at horses,\" she grumbled, pulling out a pretty black mare, who tossed her head up when her mistress rubbed her forehead. That was fine by me. After attaching my saddlebags to Hansel's horse and getting on in front of him, we were off. I dozed off for twenty minute intervals as we rode through the evening until we came to the next stop three towns over. I hid behind Hansel when Gretel introduced us to the mayor, who apparently was too busy ogling her to even notice that we were there. \"Hey!\" Hansel finally got tired to listen to the mayor's attempts to get Gretel into his bed. \"Stop it- that's my sister, and there's a six year old present!\" Well gee, it looked like my size came in handy as I looked up at the mayor with my best doe eye look as I shyly hid behind Hansel's legs. The mayor looked disappointed as Gretel went off to secure lodgings for the night and Hansel and I went off to see what all we could gather up about the witch. While he chatted with the adults, I made friends with the children, where I heard a bunch of nonsence like, \"The witch is ten feet tall!\" and \"She can turn into a beast by moonlight!\" Eventually, Hansel called me over to him and steered me over towards a small family owned inn, where he found Gretel sitting in the bar drowning down a third whisky. \"Gretel, I'm going to put Selena up to bed; afterwards, I'll meet you down here and we can talk, OK?\" he muttered, hoisting me up further onto his hip. Gretel handed him a key, waving him off. \"Hansel?\" I piped up, speaking for the first time since I woke up early that afternoon. \"Why am I getting the feeling that Gretel doesn't like me?\" \"Oh, she's that way towards everyone,\" he reassured me softly coming to our room. He opened the door and stepped inside before sighing. \"Well it looks like I'll be sleeping on the floor again…\" I noticed that our bags had been tossed onto the bed, leaving me to wonder how many time a week Hansel and Gretel traveled. I was going to ask him when my stomach roared out displeasure about being abused. I blushed as Hansel chuckled. \"I'll be back with food- there's jerky and bread in my saddlebags- here,\" he rummaged around before coming with a small meal that would have to satisfy my stomach for the time being. I smiled my thanks at my favorite of the twins before digging in. After I had eaten as much as I could, I crawled into one of the beds and fell asleep before my head hit the pillow. I was awoken a while later by Gretel entering the small room with a tary full of food, which she set onto the foot of the bed. \"Come and get it,\" she grumbled before going to her crossbow to check it. While I stuffed myself, she fussed over her weapon, swearing when one of the bolts became jammed. \"Fuck it, this is the nineteenth time this damned thing's jammed up!\" I made a soft sound and the crossbow floated out of Gretel's hands and landed on the bed next to my plate. I made sound after sound, going higher in pitch until finally a dead mouse sprang free of the crossbow. I handed it over to Gretel, motioning for her to try it out, which she did. O her surprise, the crossbow worked without a hitch. \"Wow- this little beast is what had been giving me trouble all these months?\" she scowled, flinging the mouse into a corner of the room. \"Thanks, Lena.\" It until the next morning, after the twins slain the witch and Hansel had gotten me my own horse that I realized that Gretel had shown me kindness in giving me a nickname.[Chapter 4] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. Four months later, and I had already proven myself to be a deadly fighter with both my fists and my slingshot. I had begged for Gretel to teach me how to use her crossbow. The ending result was when I dislocated my shoulder and decided that I would stick to regular long bows. They were much easier for me to use, as Hansel and Gretel soon found out. And also, my twelfth birthday was rapidly approaching. I mentioned it to Hansel, because I was closer to him than I was to Gretel before dropping the subject. I had started to earn money for being Hansel and Gretel's book of witchy information. Whenever we were out and about and they just so happened to forget something, I would be right there with all my knowledge about witches and fill them in. Gretel didn't seem to mind at all- in fact, she seemed to enjoy having me around. True, we weren't exactly best friends, but at least she tolerated me. On Christmas Eve, I snuck out to buy some things for the following morning, which I imagined the twins to ignore. Not this time, though. I was planning on making it a Christmas no one would forget… I bought a tiny tree, some presents and three meat cakes- one for each of us to enjoy for our morning meal- before I returned to the inn where we were staying at. I entered our room quietly, knowing that both twins were sound sleepers unless a loud noise woke them up. I set the tree on the fireplace before setting Hansel and Gretel's gifts down by their pillows and snuggling into bed next to Gretel. Ever since the two of us agreed on a truce two months back, after I saved her from a river witch, we had began to share a bed to let Hansel sleep on a bed (for once). The following morning, I was woken up by the sounds of Hansel and Gretel yawning. I sat up and rubbed my eyes, waking up immediately. I ignored the sounds of both twins exclaiming over their unexpected gifts before Hansel called me over. \"Selena, if I'm not mistaken, then it looks like there's something hanging from the mantle place,\" he informed me with twinkling eyes. I looked over and raised an eyebrow when I saw one of Hansel's socks hanging from the mantle place. I was lifted up by him to grab the sock. To my surprise, it was heavier than what I was expecting. Hansel set me down onto the wood floor and the twins watched, amused as I uncovered my presents. Soft mittens. Money. Books. A diary. New strings for my slingshot. A quill and bottle of ink. Just as I thought I was done, I discovered one thing more. A doll with a soft rag body and porcelain legs, arms and head, and real human hair in the prettiest shade of gold. She was wearing a blue dress and her face was delicately painted on. I smiled as I jumped to hug Gretel, then Hansel before a knock sounded at the door, which turned out to be the innkeeper with the meat pies I brought the night before, cooked to perfection. I smiled at the looks of surprise that flitted across Hansel and Gretel's faces as we all dug into our Christmas morning meal. In the next chapter, I'll have Selena kill her first witch. For those of you who are wondering about the river witch, Selena distracted her long enough for Gretel to kill her. R&R;, pleasy snezy![Chapter 5] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. Three years later, I was fifteen years old and had worked my way up from being the tag along sidekick to being an actual witch hunter. The only problem was, Hansel and Gretel hadn't exactly allowed me to slay a witch. And yes, I had long since forgiven them for slaying my mother. Yes there were times when I missed her, but I always told myself that I had a new family with Hansel and Gretel. True, we were a dysfunctional family; Gretel was always gruff and never smiled once in the three and a half years I had known her and Hansel was like a best friend to me, always there to show me how to better my technique. And then there was me. The half witch, half human. It didn't matter where we went, my story always followed, but of course, I never defended, nor did I debuke these claims. Of how Hansel and Gretel rescued me from my mother, who was a child eating witch. Of how my magic hair could heal any injuries, just as long as it wasn't cut. Of how I could control small fires and read auras. Of how I couldn't die. It didn't matter what kind of injuries I received, my body would always knit itself back together. Sometimes, it would take more time than others, but I would always be ready for a second round when morning came. I had also somehow or other ended up with a longbow and a quiver that was always full with two dozen arrows, which I would make myself. I had proven myself to be a deadly accurate shot, even with my other weapons, which included brass knuckles, spinning stars, a cutlass, and according to Hansel, \"a kick ass attitude to match\". I had also gotten over my shy demeanor and quietness and had adopted a new persona. \"Come out and fight like the true witch you are, you maggot brained filled bitch!\" Yep, that would be me, as I battled a witch. Mind you, not by myself, but while I waited for Hansel and Gretel to collect themselves and come finish off this little pest. She hissed, causing for me to roll me eyes as I lunged at her, throwing four of my spinning stars at her. One in the head, two in the chest, and one in the stomach. She crashed into a tree, with me jumping out of the way just n time. I took my sword and beheaded her, spitting on her corpse as I bought my lighter out and set her on fire. The protocol was simple. Destroy the witch, but keep the head as evidence, if we could. As I stuffed her head into a bag, my attention was turned to Hansel, who had managed to stand up and support Gretel, who was holding her head and moaning softly. \"Looks like a concession,\" I muttered darkly, handing my braid to her to hold. I took a deep breath. \" Flowers gleam and glow, Let your powers shine Make the clock reverse Bring back what once was mine Heal the past and hurts Change the fate's design Save what has been lost Bring back what once was mine What once was mine \" Once I was satisfied that Gretel would survive the short trek back to the village, I was hugged by Hansel. \"You did good work, Lena,\" he praised me. I smiled happily as I took the twins hands and began the trek back to the village with them. I was now five inches sort of being five feet tall, and my hair was thirty feet long, unless specially braided and coiled to the back of my head to keep out of my way. Even then, my unruly curls reached my ankles. I had started to where my hair with spiked strips to teach people never to grab my hair unless they wanted holes in their hands. I had also discovered my talent with music, especially with musical insterments, singing and dancing. I didn't show it often, but I was talented. Did I also mention I had taught myself gymnastics? But along with my newfound talents, came a darker side of me- I became cocky, sassy, feisty. I would mouth off anyone who dared to call me a little girl. True, I looked like I could be anywhere in between eight and twelve (and in rare cases, sometimes even over twelve), but I used this to my advantage, which turned out to be just right for baiting a witch, which happened more times than I would care to remember. I also trained myself to have heightened senses- mainly, my eyesight, my hearing and my sense of smell. As well as this, I also trained endlessly until I had unlimited stamina, speed, strength and reflexes, which made me a force not to be messed with. As well as these abilities, I also discovered that I could communicate telepathically with children, which made our jobs a whole lot more easier for us to deal with, seeing as how nine times out of ten, we dealt with witches who would kidnap children and eat them. Needless to say, there were some stories that didn't have happy endings. Unlike today- we were called for to destroy a witch who was making the weather act all haywire, with droughts, floods, hurricanes… you name it, it happened. We walked along the overgrown path that led back to the village, with me acting too chirpy for someone who just made her first kill in a witch hunt. \"How do you do it?\" Gretel suddenly asked me, holding onto my left hand. \"Do what?\" I asked her, confused as we came into sight of the village. \"Do what we do and still be happy,\" she answered me grimly as we spotted the mayor, along with the townspeople, looking jittery and excited as we approached. I shrugged my shoulders as Hansel handed me the bag with the witch's head inside. \"Go on- it's your turn to be a hero,\" he murmured to me softly as I began to saunter up to the mayor with my head held high and my face neutral before I handed him the bag. Everyone was silent as the mayor reached into the bag and pulled out the witch's head. They remained silent as I returned to stand next to Hansel and Gretel with a huge wad of bills and a bag of coins. \"Let's go, these witches aren't going to slay themselves, aren't they?\" I muttered to them as we began to head towards the inn to gather up our stuff and ride to the next town.[Chapter 6] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. Over the following few days, Hansel seemed ill, so I worked hard at gathering up herbs to cure his mysterious illness. I mashed herbs, used crystals, everything that I could think of. Until one day, when I walked into our room at the inn and caught him injecting something into his leg. \"Hansel!\" I shrieked, marching over to him and snatching the needle from him. \"You tell me to stay away from drug, but you inject yourself? Where's the fairness in this?\" I peered at the needle with my inner eye and saw that it wasn't drugs like I thought it would be, but rather an odd mixture of herbs and potions that had gone missing from my pack weeks earlier. I had originally thought that the thieves were peasent children who didn't know any better, but now I knew who the culprit was. \"Hansel, what is this?\" I asked him carefully. \"When I was a kid, a witch forced me to eat so much candy that I became sick,\" he explained weakly. \"Now I have to take an injection every few hours or else I'll die.\" \"You have the candy poisoning,\" I quickly diagnosed him with. \"You're lucky that this didn't end up killing you! Don't you know better than to mix stuff up and then use it? You should leave this kind of stuff to the professionals!\" I scolded him, scowling as I went over to my pack in search of ginger ale. I found it, tucked away in a tiny bottle, which I handed to Hansel. \"Here, drink this. I'll make something for you to have three times a day, with meals. It'll have to do until I finish a potion that will cure your candy poisoning.\" Hansel drank the ginger ale with a happy sigh, leaning back in bed as the effect of the soothing stomach calmer took effect. I in the meantime, began to crush herbs with my mortar and pestle that Gretel got me for Christmas the year before. I ended up using the last of my herbs to make Hansel a weeks worth of medicine for him to use before heading out to find him a small meal. I returned about fifteen minutes later with a sandwich stuffed with meat and melted cheese and a wineskin with cider. I hand the meal to him before cleaning the syringe with my fire abilities to make sure that he wouldn't poison himself again before filing it with the liquid that I made. I sat next to Hansel and took his leg onto my lap before feeling for a vein. He raised an eyebrow as I carefully inserted the needle into his leg and pushed the lever that injected the medicine into his system. \"There- you have to be careful that you put the medicine directly into a vien or else you'll die,\" I explained in a matter of fact like voice. \"Also, the food can help the medicine to break down faster and spread throughout your body faster.\" \"Thanks, Lena,\" he smiled at me wearily. \"What will happen if I take it without food?\" I sighed, pushing an escaped curl from my face and tucking it behind my left ear. \"I don't want to find out,\" was all that I offered him with a glare. \"Now promise me that you wont try to make anything else out of my stuff, OK? I don't want to deal with Gretel if you're killed!\" \"I promise,\" he mumbled sleepily, rolling over and falling asleep. I sighed in exasperation as I went over to my now empty jars and pouches to go to the market and buy more herbs and spices.[Chapter 7] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. Four years later and I made myself well known for being a witch who hunts witches. I know, I know… Ironic, isn't it? I was now twenty one years old and still under five feet tall, but that was alright with me. Just as long as I had my trusty weapons and my magic, I would be alright. Upon our arrival to Augsburg, we came across a sight that I had grown accustomed to seeing. A wrongful trial. \"You know what a witch looks like!\" howled the sheriff, spittle flying from his mouth he pushed the mayor aside and continued to roar out to the crowd. \"They ride at night and make pacts with the devil! This woman will burn!\" I rolled my eyes as I followed Hansel and Gretel towards the center of the village, where the \"trial\" was taking place. I saw that Gretel had her trusty gun out and looked pissed as hell as she marched up to the sheriff and pointed her weapon at the back of his head. \"Let the girl go, or else I'll blow his brains all over you fucking hillbillies,\" whispered Gretel, by all means serious. \"I'd do as she says- I wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of the barrel if she's pissed at you,\" I smirked, drawing down the hood of my red cloak to reveal my face to the villagers. I was pretty enough, but my beauty was marred by several scars that criss crossed my face, due to a witch who I battled three months back. My skin was a fair as snow, my teal eyes fringed by luscious lashes, my cheeks were rosy, and my plump rosebud shaped lips were a bright red in color. My hair was at this point, forty feet long, so I had long since given up on wearing it in a coil, instead opting for a layered braid that fell over my shoulder like a waterfall. I still wore my spiked strips in my hair, only I had them buried deep so that if someone ran their hand over my hair, they wouldn't get spiked; but if someone grabbed my hair… I would hate to be them. I watched quietly as Hansel shooed the bodyguards away from the woman, then examined her at Gretel's order. \"When a woman truly deals in witchcraft, she cannot hide it. A nasty rot sets it. It shows in her teeth, in her skin and in her eyes.\" He turned to look at the redhead, who gave her name as Mina. \"This is not a witch; this woman's clean,\" \"I'm sure your sheriff was only trying to protect you good people,\" spoke up Gretel with a hint of sarcasm in her voice. \"But your mayor had done a very smart thing.\" \"He hired us,\" I spoke up. \"My name is Selena, and this is Hansel and Gretel,\" I introduced them; as I said their names, they each shouldered their weapons just to show the crowd that we meant business. \"We know that many of your children have gone missing,\" spoke up Hansel, his hand on my shoulder in a brotherly protective way. \"But killing an innocent woman will not bring them back.\" \"Go home! We don't want you here!\" shouted someone in the crowd. \"We don't want more evil in Augsburg!\" hollered someone else. \"We evil is upon you whether you like it, or not,\" I retorted calmly. \"Now if your children are still alive, we will find them. But anyone who harms this woman, you're going to have me to deal with,\" Hansel said loudly. \"That goes for everyone else- do not start accusing people left and right of being a witch!\" I chimed in. \"Now go home!\" shouted Hansel. \"Go!\" I turned and saw the mayor flapping his hand at the crowd of citizens who were still lingering about. I smirked as I turned to Gretel, who had stood back and let her twin do all the talking. \"I guess you're free to go,\" Hansel tolf Mina in a quiet voice that only I overheard. \"Thank you,\" she said graciously before turning. \"Hansel,\" she whispered his name before vanishing into an alleyway. \"You're welcome,\" grunted Hansel. Meanwhile, the sheriff was fuming at Gretel. \"What the hell do you think you're doing, huh? That woman is a suspect in my custady! You can't just come here and-\" \"Any man with half a brain could tell that she is not a witch,\" coolly replied Gretel. \"Now listen, sheriff,\" spoke up the mayor. \"Hansel, Gretel and Selena have been brought here-\" \"You better listen!\" roared the sheriff, spit flying from his mouth once more. \"I'm not going to have this bitch, her scoundrel of a brother and a bustard of a brat coming into my town and telling me what to do!\" roared the sheriff. That was the last straw for Gretel. She cracked the sheriff's nose with her forehead, making him fall to the grond with a loud wail of pain. \"Don't,\" Hansel shouted as he aimed his gun at the sheriff's deputies, who drew their weapons to defend their sheriff. \"Just don't,\" he sighed as they did as he advised them to. I giggled at Gretel's temper before the mayor ushered us towards where we would be working during our stay in Augsburg.[Chapter 8] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. \" There's been reports of a strange cottage in the north forest. Locals won't go near the place. A good place to start the investigation. \" I heard the mayor's words echoing in my head as I trudged through the thick overgrown path that led to the cottage. I nervously checked my weapons to make sure everything was in place, which they were. Gretel slammed open the door with her foot before entering with me close on her heels. And then we saw her. \"Move!\" ordered Gretel. But the witch had other ideas. She threw an object that looked like a chair at Gretel, which she blocked with her crossbow before firing bolt after bolt at the witch. I joined in with my throwing stars, one of them embedding in her shoulder. The witch shrieked at me before grabbing a branch and flying out of the window backwards. \"You have got to be seriously shitting me, aren't you?\" I muttered before taking off after her with Gretel close on my heels. Hansel popped up at that moment, shooting the witch off her broom with his gun before giving chase on foot with Gretel and I close on his heels. Hansel fired off a few shots from his gun, which all hit the trees that the witch was running into. The witch began to throw little balls of fire at Hansel, but they didn't affect him, until the witch made several trees block him from reaching her. \"Move!\" I barked, flicking my wrist at the trees, which all exploded into sawdust, most of it getting onto Hansel. \"Sorry!\" \"No worries!\" he hollered as he continued to give chase to the witch. I looked behind me and didn't see Gretel… Until she came flying from the trees and tackled the witch. The witch effortlessly tossed her away and kicked Hansel in the chest, leaving me up to bat. I ran at her, feigning left when I was actually going for her wand. I grabbed it and snapped it in half before clocking her in the nose. I kept her occupied long enough for Gretel to fire her crossbow and hook the witch's ankle, which she then used to hoist her up into a tree. The three of us stood there, looking up at our witch, who was beyond furious as she twisted and screamed at us. \"She looks angry,\" pointed out Gretel. \"With a face like that, I'd be angry too,\" joked Hansel. The witch continued to snarl and twist in her quest to free herself. \"Would you shut up?\" I snarled, using the hilt of my blade to knock her out.[Chapter 9] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. \"The house in the woods was a dead end, mayor,\" announced Hansel upon our return. We were now in his office, with me and Gretel changed from our trousers and shirts into dresses for comfort. I told the twins that nothing exciting would happen tonight, judging from the auras I was picking up on around the small town. \"No trace of any kids, I'm sorry,\" I added, sitting in the widow as I looked out onto the village square. \"But we found this,\" continued Gretel, rolling out a scroll. I came over from my perch to explain what it was. \"That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor,\" I explained, pointing to the diagram. \"It's an eclipse of the moon. It happens once in a generation and is a night most sacred and holy to witches.\" \"Oh my God,\" breathed the Mayor, staring at the parchment with huge eyes. \"When?\" \"According to this, three nights from now,\" I quickly calculated in my head. \"There's no doubt in my mind that all this is connected,\" pointed out Hansel. \"Children being taken in these numbers from the roads and fields so close to town; a wicth does not come out into the open like that.\" \"Not unless she has to,\" I murmured as Hansel's timer when off. I looked at the sjy and saw that it was an hour past noon as he went into a corner to administrate the shot of medicine. \"Witch activity as been increasing lately; more sightings, animal slaughters, Sabbaths,\" listed Gretel as the mayor tried to see what Hansel was doing. \"It seems the coming of the Blood Moon is dragging every damned witch from their dark hiding place.\" \"So, it seems like a good thing you brought us here, doesn't it mayor?\" spoke up Hansel, causally loping over to stand next to me as I examined the diagram further. The mayor reached into his jacket and pulled out a huge wad of bills, which he tossed to Hansel. \"Half your money now. The rest when the children are bought back alive,\" he informed us in a grave voice before a knock sounded at the door. \"Ah, here he is, right on time.\" In entered a grizzled man with a kind face and smiling eyes. \"This is Jackson, he knows these woods inside and out, and he'll take you to where the last sightings were,\" introduced the mayor. \"Yeah, we can be there in a few hours,\" he told us. \"Not at night,\" I informed him, crossing my arms over my chest. \"It's too dangerous,\" added Gretel. \"We'll leave in the morning.\" \"Yeah, she's right- it's much to dangerous,\" confirmed Hansel. \"So is there any place where we can get a drink in this hellhole?\" I sighed and rolled my eyes. Typical Hansel, wanting a drink when we had just barely even started on a job.[Chapter 10] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs. SUMMARY: Selena is a young girl with extraordinary powers and a pure heart of gold. When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. Hansel, Gretel, Jackson and I were in Augsburg's only pub, drinking. I stand corrected, Hansel and Gretel were drinking while I nursed a tankard of apple cider. Jackson every now and then took a swig from his flask. I didn't get drunk- spirits made m powers act fucked up. \"There have been abductions here, and here, on both sides of the river\" Jackson was explaining as he jabbaed at a map. Hansel was getting us another round of drinks and was flirting with the woman behind the counter. \"And on this last one, we belive a troll was involved.\" \"A troll?\" Gretel and I both asked at the same time. \"Trolls are extra,\" sighed Hansel, handing us our drinks. \"Another round.\" \"It's really unusual; look at this one,\" Gretel pointed out, pulling a report closer to read from it. \"A father and three children attacked; one child was taken, but she didn't touch the other two.\" \"Uh-oh,\" gulped Hansel. \"That's weird,\" I mused. \"That's so weird,\" Hansel grunted. \"It is strange, it is strange, okay?\" He took another sip as Gretel sighed and smacked his arm, making him spill his drink on himself. \"Yeah, yeah,\" I grumbled into my cider, smiling at the twins. \"Then again, we hunt witches for a living; what's normal, really?\" asked Hansel as a lad came up to our table, clutching a book to his chest. \"Excuse me, Hansel and Gretel?\" he stuttered. The twins looked at him, giving him the courage that he needed. \"Oh my God, I can't believe you're here. I'm Ben, Benjamin Walser. I'm really quite a fan of your work.\" \"That's great,\" muttered Hansel uncomfortably as Gretel sat back. I raised an eye at him,used to being overlooked. After all, I was the bastard child of a witch. \"It's nice to meet you, Benjamin,\" greeted Gretel, much more friendlier towards the excited young man. \"Listen, if it's not too much trouble, would you please sign this…\" And he thunked the heavy book down on the table. From my end of the table, I saw that it was full of newspaper clippings praising Hansel and Gretel's witch hunting work. \"Oh no…\" groaned Hansel before sighing. \"Okay.\" \"Oh my…\" was all that Gretel could say as she stared down at the book. \"Yeah, that's from when your found the Fox Witch of Antwerp and sak her in the moat,\" he explained happily. I raised my eyebrow- technically, that was me who did the deed. Hansel and Gretel were fighting off the pox, sending me out to do the dirty work. Evendently, the press didn't get the memo. \"And this one's from the Secret Witch Ring of Belsen, when they tried to put a gateway to hell underneath the courthouse.\" Okay, another job I did. Was I beginning to get jealous? I hope not- my eyes turned green whenever I got jealous. \"I mean, you guys certainly taught those witches a thing or two.\" \"Wow.\" Okay, I'll admit it; I snorted at Gretel- she looked like an owl with her wide, unblinking eyes at that moment. \"This is amazing. And… weird.\" \"A little creepy,\" Hansel clarified, winking at me. \"Yeah… you really keep this stuff,\" chuckled Gretel, turning the page. \"Alright, well…\" Hansel tried to shoo Ben away, only to egg him on. \"I just have so many questions; do you mind?\" asked Ben, acting like a reporter who stalked us until I lost my temper. It was his damned fault that he was spying on me while I was bathing. \"You know, we have-\" Hansel said just as Gretel said, \"Oh no, no, no, not at all! Go ahead.\" I swear, she took almost all the pleasure in tortueing her twin. \"Alright, how do you best kill a witch?\" asked Ben before looking at Gretel. \"'Lena?\" prodded Gretel before I spoke up. \"Cutting off their head seems to work, ripping out their hearts, and skinning them is also nice.\" I watched as Ben squirmed. \"Yeah, but burning them is the best way,\" added in Gretel. \"'Cause that's the best way to be safe.\" \"Burning, yeah, of course,\" smiled Ben. \"Burn them all,\" grumbled Hansel into his drink. \"Is it true that witches can't harm you?\" was the next question. \"It's true for the three of us, unless they do something that gets them hurt physically,\" I smirked, recalling when we were fighting a three headed witch who's head kept regrowing after we beheaded her. Hansel had jumped to advoid getting bitten and had rolled his ankle. \"Well no, that is horseshit, son,\" answered Hansel over me, prodding my side and making me yelp. I swatted his arm, making him dump the other half of his drink on his lap. \"Their magic doesn't work on us,\" Gretel clarified, sending the two of us glares. \"And they haven't killed us, yet.\" \"Do you think that's because of the witch you burned when you were children?\" prodded Ben. \"I guess that's how it all started for you guys, I mean, is that how you became witch hunters? How do you get your guns? How do you get your weapons?\" Uncharted territory. I never talked about that subject with either one of the twins; I knew it to be sensitive. Their past, not the weapons, that is. \"Okay, okay,\" grunted Hansel, standing and pressing the book to Ben's chest. \"There's lots of things to do. You're a really nice kid, but we have a town under attack.\" At that moment, a man ran into the pub, slamming into one of the pillers and the back wall, panting hard. \"She killed them!\" he wailed. \"She killed them all!\" \"Who killed what?\" I demanded, standing. \"The witch!\" he howled, causing for gasps and cried to sound out. \"She killed the trackers! All of them! She gave me a message for you all!\" He began to retch and suddenly exploded, body parts flying every which way. Hansel barely had enough time to push Ben and I behind him. \"The Curse of Hunger for Crawling Things,\" I muttered as I flicked a speck of blood from my blouse. \"I fucking hate that one!\" \"That was awesome!\" cheered Ben.[Chapter 11] Daughter of the Night I don't own Witch Hunters or Disney or any of the songs.

When she teams up with the legendary Hansel and Gretel to put her gifts to good use, she finds herself battling everything that her evil mother taught her. \"Hey, hey.\" That night after the three of us had crashed in our single room (Gretel and I were sharing the bed, Hansel was on the floor with his bag for a pillow), I woke up to find Gretel was talking to Hansel about something. I rolled over to go back to sleep when her whispered words caught my attention. \"I just had this really weird dream,\" she announced in a low voice. \"Oh yeah?\" yawned Hansel. \"Yeah,\" she answered. \"About what?\" grumbled Hansel, his voice thick with sleep. I felt the bed dip as Gretel leaned down to touch him. \"I think it was about our mother,\" she whispered quietly. \"We don't talk about that,\" Hansel snapped. \"Go to sleep.\" And with that, he rolled underneath the bed and let out a loud groan. I sat up when I felt Gretel leave the bed to stand next to the window. I got up as well and joined her. We were both silent for a while until I spoke. \"You wanna tell me?\" I asked her. \"Not really,\" she answered, biting her lip as she shivered from the chill in the room. I wrapped my arms around her waist and allowed my fire to warm her up. \"Thanks,\" she told me, smiling. \"What would we ever do without you?\" \"I don't know- whatever it was you were doing before you…\" I trailed off, not really wanting to say it. Gretel understood as she wrapped her arms around me in turn, where we stayed until the sun rose.[Chapter 12] I need more ideas for this fic! Kindly message me with what you think should happen.

So it happened that Ben grew up with only his mother and brother as guidance. Nevertheless they were a happy little family, even though they merely scraped by, living in one of the poorer areas of Augsburg. His mother was a very warm and gentle woman, who cared not only for her two little boys but also helped wherever she could, often without asking something in return. She would, unlike other mothers, never be caught beating her children, because she had experienced what damage this could inflict on them. Although she never talked about it, a scar on her face showed everyone that she had been badly mistreated some time in her life. When her children asked her about it, though, she replied that she had cut herself on a branch while climbing, and, not knowing any better, they believed her. Tom, who was two years older than Ben was quite a courageous boy who loved getting into all sorts of mischief and adventure. He loved Ben dearly and was excited to be an older brother, and enthusiastically embraced the task of teaching Ben all the things a boy does and does not do. As soon as Ben was old enough Tom would teach him how to climb trees, how to fish and later even how to shoot and fight. They got along very well and barely ever really fought. Ben loved and admired his brother and always tried hard to impress him, which he generally managed. However, he was not only as courageous and adventurous as his brother, but had also inherited his mother`s caring and helping personality. He loved learning how to handle the household duties from his mother just as much as he liked learning all the boy-stuff from his brother and also helped her caring for their neighbors. Additionally, he was very clever, learning quickly and coming up with ideas for new games or ways to ease the everyday work. Of course, this inventiveness was sometimes used to plan some mischief, too, and on some days his ideas just would not work out, but he never let that get him down. He was determined, although he also could be quite shy at times. All in all, Ben lived a happy life, without his father, but with a loving mother and a proud brother. No one could have foreseen the tragedy that was soon to come and change the life of this young boy.[Chapter 2] It was a mild summer`s day and the streets were full of playing children, only little 8-year-old Ben was not among them. A week ago he had climbed a very high and old tree as a dare. Unfortunately, one of the branches he stepped on broke and he fell to the ground, spraining his ankle. Tom had half-carried him back home, which, luckily, was not too far away. His mother had tended to his ankle immediately but nevertheless he had to stay at home for some weeks. When Ben learned this, it had quite a bad effect on him, as he spent quite a while outside. This time, not even Tom could cheer him up, because, even though Tom pitied his little brother, he was far too restless to stay in the house all day. Every morning Tom would go outside on some adventure and come back in the evening. Ben could not even hold it against him, as he knew that Tom soon would have to start an apprenticeship soon, so it was only natural to him, that he tried to enjoy himself as much as possible now. This summer day it had been the same. Tom had left, barely having finished his meagre breakfast, eager to throw himself into some adventure with the other boys. Ben had watched his brother leave with a sad look on his face. How he wished that he could go, too. Instead he would listen to his brother`s stories of what he had experienced through the day and try to reduce the boredom in his own day. His mother smiled faintly when she saw her youngest son frowning. He always was so impatient and restless, but she knew the remedy to that frown: Give him something to do. \"It will be only two more weeks until you can run off with the boys again. In the meantime you could come over, sit here at the table and help me fold the laundry. That way the day will pass quicker.\" With a half-hearted smile Ben hobbled over to the table and sat down. Usually he loved helping his mother, but after 2 weeks of confinement in the house he longed for nothing more than fresh air on his face and some fun. His mother entered, carrying a huge pile of laundry. \"How can this be all ours?\" asked Ben, looking at the pile. This would surely keep him occupied for a while. \"Oh, it is not. I washed the Klein`s things, because they just had a new baby and already have more than enough to do with their children.\" He remembered the Klein family; they lived only two houses away from them and already had five children, additionally to the new baby. He liked the children, especially the eldest boy, who was a year older than him, but was afraid of the father, as he often returned home drunk, yelling at and hitting everyone and everything that dared to cross his way. Folding the laundry took quite some time and when his mother left to bring it over to the neighbors, Ben reclaimed his old seat at the window and stared outside, dreaming. When he grew up he would not be found learning one of those common jobs. He wanted to travel, to invent things and, in a way, help the people, not only to take their money. He would never settle down and have children; girls were quite stupid, gross and boring anyway. They would play with their dolls and never do anything fun, like climbing or play-fighting. No, he would definitely never marry and never fall in love, either. When Ben`s mother returned, she found him fast asleep, with his head sunken on his chest. She spread a thin sheet over him and smilingly kissed his head before going out again to get water and start doing the soup for dinner. Ben woke up, wondering how long he had slept. He looked over to the fireplace where his mother was stirring their food in a pot. \"Has Tom come back, yet?\" His mother startled. \"Hey, had a nice sleep? No, he is not back yet, but he should be any minute.\" Ben hobbled over to the washing basin to wash his hands before dinner and sat down at the table. \"I wonder where Tom is staying… The food is ready, so I suggest we already eat something.\" Said his mother and filled their bowls, before seating herself at the table with her son. They ate but Tom had not reappeared yet. Ben and his mother both started to worry, so latter decided to go over to the Becker family to see, whether their son, with whom Tom had wanted to go out today, had already returned. Meanwhile, Ben started looking out of the window into the darkening streets, growing more and more restless. He knew what the parents told their children: If they stayed away after dark, witches would come and get them. Of course, he himself had never had an encounter with one, but he also knew that some women, whom he could barely believe to be witches, as they did not look evil in any way, were burned as witches. So, after a while he started wondering, whether witches were real, or whether they were simply a story to scare the children. But how could it be explained then, that children disappeared without any trace sometimes? Ben's mother returned, even more worried than before. \"I was at the Becker`s, Gerd has been back for over an hour, he came back alone, because Tom was nowhere to be seen. He thought he might already have gone home, so he just went alone and did not say anything. His father and some of the other men are going out to look for Tom, maybe he fell and hit his head.\" Ben could see that this was not what his mother really was worried about, but was too scared to say out loud, what might have happened to his brother: That he had been kidnapped and killed by witches.[Chapter 3] This night neither Ben nor his mother slept. They were huddled closely together, consoling each other and trying not to think of what might have happened to Tom. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Her face both displaying hope and fear, Ben's mother got up and hurried to the door. It was Mr. Meyer, another neighbor and one of the men from the search-party. He talked for a few minutes in a quiet voice. Ben did not understand what he was saying, but could see his mother nod from time to time. Before he left, Mr. Meyer gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. \"Tom is dead, am I right, Mama?\" Ben asked, trying to suppress the tears that started welling up. The woman turned around, wearing a half-hearted smile, but one could see, that her son had voiced her thoughts. \"That is not proved, yet. Mr. Meyer only told me that they were not yet able to find your brother in the dark and that they will continue searching by the break of dawn. So don't give him up yet, honey. \". She came over and held him tight. \"Don't worry, Ben, I am sure we will get Tom back. Try to catch some sleep now, so you will be awake to welcome him home.\" Although he was only 8 years old, he knew that his mother said this more to convince herself than to convince him. Not long after this he fell asleep and every time he woke he found his mother sitting at his bed or pacing the room until he finally woke up and the sun had begun to rise. The morning dragged along and Ben had reclaimed his seat at the window, just like the day before. He stared outside, so he would see, if there was anyone coming to their house. He thought of his brother, what might have happened to him and what a chance there was he would ever see him again. He was thrown out of his thoughts when there was another knock on the door. His mother hurried to open it and clasped a hand in front of her mouth. Ben did not believe his eyes. There in the doorway stood his brother, looking quite bruised and dirty but alive. In a rush of joy Ben forgot his ankle and tried to run the few steps towards his brother. Of course, this did not work and he fell on the floor. Their mother closed the door after thanking the men who had brought her eldest son home and locked Tom in a long and tight embrace, before she went off to prepare a bath for him. Tom had plunged into a chair, looking tired. Soon Ben sat by him. \"Are you alright? I was so worried, and Mama was too, I thought I would never see you again.\" Ben blurted out, the tears he had held back during the night, now streaming freely down his cheeks. Tom looked at him, confused. \"I… I don't remember. I…I was playing hide and seek with the boys down by the meadow and the next thing I know is that I am waking up in the forest and my head hurts and my knife was gone and then I see Mr. Meyer and some other men nearby, so I called for them. And then they brought me back here.\" Ben looked alarmed. \"So you don't even know how you got there?\" Tom shook his head. \"No, as I said… I was playing and then I was in the forest.\" Before Ben could inquire more about what had happened to his brother, his mother called and Tom left to take a bath, leaving Ben to his thoughts again. How did Tom get into the forest, why was he unable to remember anything? Why was his knife missing? He had heard about people forgetting things after hitting their heads hard, but he felt that this was not the answer. Maybe Tom had fought something or someone? Ben decided to keep an eye on his brother for the next few days, to see whether he could realize something unusual about him.[Chapter 4] Even though it had been over two weeks since Tom had been missing, Ben woke up several times at night and checked whether his brother was still there. Sometimes he even found their mother sitting on a chair at the end of one of their beds, sleeping. She had been far more protective after the incident, which was quite understandable. Neither Tom nor Ben were allowed to leave the town, not even when they were accompanied by other children, and they always had to be back before dark. Tom, however, did not even want to go outside anyway; since that night, of which he still claims to remember nothing, he was not himself anymore, as Ben would put it. He had watched his brother closely for every day, tried to talk to him and play with him, but Tom never said very much and just blankly stared out of the window for the whole day, except for mealtimes, but even there he did not eat with as much appetite as before. Their mother let a doctor come to examine Tom, but he could not help very much either, he only reassured her that Tom would be alright, once the shock had worn off. Even a month later there was not much improvement, though, and Ben wondered, whether he would ever really get his brother back. Then, one day, another child went missing, a 7 year old girl this time. She had been sent to bring food to her father and brother, who were helping on a field outside of town, but she did not return home after that. The search went on for two weeks until it was declared that she would probably be dead by now, killed by a wolf, a bear or another wild creature that lurked in the forest. The whole town felt sorry for the family and they and the little girl were included in every prayer during church. Ben, however, did not think that the little girl had become the victim of an animal. Although he did not dare to voice his thoughts, he was pretty sure that she had been kidnapped by witches and that his brother had been attacked by one, too. He theorized that the witch must have put a curse on Tom, which would explain the lack of improvement in his recovery. On the other hand, he was not sure how his brother, or anyone for that matter, could ever escape a witch. He had never met one before and was not fond of ever meeting one, but he had heard tales that they were very powerful and that no one, no matter how strong that person was, could survive an encounter with a witch, if she did not have a reason for letting them. But what reason would a witch have to let his brother live? This was the only thing about his theory that Ben could not make sense of.[Chapter 5] The disappearance of the little girl had only been the beginning. Over the following weeks more children disappeared. All the remaining children were now kept inside the house by their parents, but that did not stop the disappearances, either. Rumours spread, about witch sightings near the forest, and soon enough everyone believed that those witches must have stolen their children. How else could they vanish unnoticed from their beds? The harvest had been quite poor, too, due to a hailstorm, and many people would probably not make it during the winter, due to lack of food. Was this also the doing of a witch? Fear was everywhere in the town at that time, no one trusted anyone and many women were captured and burned or drowned without being given a fair trial. Meanwhile Tom did not seem to recover at all; in fact he rather seemed to be getting worse again. He ate even less than before, did not react when he was spoken to and started having bad dreams at night. Ben barely slept those nights either, he was waking up almost every hour, because Tom was threshing around in his bed, muttering. Ben always tried to comfort him by patting his head and talking to him in a soothing voice, just like Tom had done with him when he was younger and had a nightmare. Their mother also had sent for a doctor, who could live with them and keep an eye on Tom. He was accompanied by a girl with strawberry-blonde hair, about eleven years old. She had been living at the orphanage before, but when the doctor had been called there to help with a sick child he had found that this girl was quite useful and therefore took her on as his assistant. Secretly, he taught her everything he knew, as she was quite intelligent, very eager to learn and seemed to have a natural talent for healing. No one ever mentioned it though, especially not during a time in which women were tied to a stake and burned on a regular basis. Ben quickly befriended the girl, whose name was Mina, and found a great conversational partner in the doctor. Even though they got along quite well, he still missed the good old times he had shared with his brother and wondered if those times would ever come back; it seemed so unlikely. He started searching through the newspapers for some new hints about what might be going on, but he did not find anything that was really interesting. Then one day a woman came into town, dressed in a sleek black dress and a black cloak. She did not say a name, but she wanted to talk to the sheriff and claimed to have some information about the missing children and the witch that was responsible for their abduction and the bad harvest. Later that day an assembly in front of the sheriff's court was announced. Ben and Mina both begged to go, but they were to stay at home with Tom and Ben's mother, while the doctor went to hear what the sheriff and the mayor had to say. He came back wearing a very thoughtful and rather unhappy expression but would not tell the children what had been talked about at the assembly. They found out, though, when he told it to Ben and Tom's mother, when they thought that the children were asleep. Apparently, the woman had told the sheriff that a woman named Adrianna, who lived with her husband on a small farm outside the town, was an evil witch, who had cursed their harvest and taken their children. The citizens were now planning to march to her home two days later and burn her, and the sheriff even gave the permission to kill her husband, as the woman had said that he was possessed by the devil.[Chapter 6] Ben had trouble falling asleep after hearing those news. What if the woman and her husband were innocent, just like the other women that had been burned? Did they have children themselves? What would happen to them? Would they burn, too? And what if they really were responsible for the bad harvest and the missing children? Would they find the children alive or would they be dead? Would they find anything at all? After all, he had heard that witches eat children. All these questions kept running through Ben's head while he tossed from side to side in his bed. He had just managed to doze off, when he heard someone moving in the room. Looking up, he saw that Tom was walking to the door. Ben called him, but he would not react, he kept walking through the living room and out of the front door. He ran after him, trying to get him to walk back into the house, but Tom kept on walking. When they were nearing the last houses of the town, Ben started feeling desperate, so he tried pulling Tom back; he even slapped him, hoping that this would wake him up, nothing worked, though; Tom kept walking, heading right into the woods. He started calling for help, wondering why no one had heard them yet, and kept on running, blocking Tom's way. They were already quite a way in the forest, when Ben, who was walking backwards, trying to push Tom back, tripped and fell, hitting his head. Now he was feeling dizzy, and his head was bleeding, but he still tried to go after Tom, which was becoming more and more difficult, due to the forest's increasing darkness and the blurred vision. He had to steady himself on trees and branches, to keep him from falling again. Soon, though, everything around him turned completely black and he collapsed right there, on the forest floor. When Ben and Tom's mother entered their room the next day, she found bot their beds to be deserted. Stricken with panic, she ran through the house, calling them, waking Mina and the doctor, then ran over to the neighbours, asking them, whether they had seen anything. When they denied that they had seen any of her boys, she broke down crying. The doctor ordered Mina to make her a strong herbal tea, to calm her down and, after dressing himself, went to the sheriff to report the missing boys, who quickly put together a search-party, which the doctor joined, too. Meanwhile the news of the two missing boys had spread through the town. Many people came by to visit the devastated mother; some bringing food, others words of sympathy, but everyone assured her that by tomorrow night the responsible witch would be burning. Between those visits she kneeled at the window, her head leaning against her folded hands, and prayed for the return of her boys. She did not eat any of the food the people had brought and drank nothing except for the herbal tea, which Mina had made her. Latter had started doing the household, figuring that she could calm herself best, when she had something to do. The boys were on her mind, too, though, and although she tried very hard, she could not keep the tears from falling. Both of them, especially Ben, had become like brothers to her, and their mother had taken care of her like her own child, even though she did not have to. Why did those terrible things always have to happen to the nicest people?[Chapter 7] It was going to be another sleepless night in the Weiser household. By twilight, Mina had finished the housework and made some food, of which she tried to coax a little into Mrs. Weiser, and now sat in front of the fire, her chin resting on her knees. She thought back on how she and the doctor first came into this house, how she had met and soon befriended Ben, who had become the little brother she never had and how Mrs Weiser had asked her to stay with her, if the boys stayed lost. She had agreed, as this woman had been so kind to her, treating her like a member of the family and not just like a simple maid or assistant. Suddenly, the door was thrust open, making the woman and the girl jump to their feet, and the doctor entered, followed by another man, who carried a small figure in his arms – Ben. They put Ben on his bed, while Mina, who had read from the doctor's face that something was not right, hurried to get his bag. When she came back, Mrs Weiser was sitting at Ben's bed, holding his hand, while the doctor explained what had happened: They had been searching quite a part of the wood already, when they spotted something that looked like blood on a tree branch, so they checked the surrounding trees, in case there were more marks like this. And soon enough they found other branches. They followed the blood trail and discovered Ben, lying unconscious on the forest floor with a cut on his head. The doctor had checked for life signs, then they scooped him up and the doctor and the other man hurried back, while the remaining men would keep on searching for Tom, until it was too dark. Now the doctor was cleaning Ben's wound before he would close it with stitches. Mina had brought a clean bandage, which he wrapped around Ben's head after he had closed the wound. Then he ordered Mina to bring a bit of wine; for Ben, so he could produce new blood, and for his mother, because she had been under a lot of stress. That night Mrs Weiser did not leave her younger son's side, she stayed awake, looking at Ben and casting worried glances at Tom's empty bed. Mina, who could not sleep either, had sneaked in quietly, in the hope of not being noticed and sent back to bed. After a few minutes, though, Mrs Weiser told her to come over and sit with her. She wrapped an arm around the girl and they stayed like this until dawn, when Ben opened his eyes. Around midday the mayor, the sheriff, the doctor, Mrs Weiser and Mina had all gathered around Ben, so he could tell them what had happened. He admitted, with a bad conscience, that he had eavesdropped on his mother and the doctor, and that he was unable to sleep, because of what he had heard. When he had dozed off, he woke up, because someone was moving in the room and he saw that Tom was walking to the door and outside. He tried to keep him back, which did not work, he had called for help, but no one heard him, so he followed him into the forest, where he tripped and hit his head, but he still tried to follow Tom, when everything went black. The reactions to this story were very different: Ben's mother had rested her head on a hand, blocking her face, and wrapped her other arm around Mina, who had tears rolling down her cheeks. The doctor stood behind them, looking thoughtful, each of his hands resting on one of their shoulders. The mayor and the sheriff exchanged meaningful glances, before they turned to Mrs Weiser, trying to reassure her that they might get the children back that night, when they went to burn the witch outside of town. The sheriff's niece was one of the missing children, so it was no question whether he was trying everything in his powers to get the children back and Mrs Weiser was at least a little bit more hopeful, when the mayor and sheriff left them.[Chapter 8] At night, almost all adults went to kill the witch and bring the children back home. The doctor initially had planned to stay out of this, because he thought it was not right to harm or even kill someone without there being a proven reason. However, since Tom had gone missing, too, he and Mrs Weiser thought that it would be better if someone came along that knew him and could safely take him back home, if he indeed was there and alive. He also did not want to let Mrs Weiser go all alone and they both thought it would be a bad idea to leave Ben only with Mina to look after him, in case something happened. So, when the sky turned dark the doctor left and Mrs Weiser tried to occupy her mind with some needle work. Ben, who was not supposed to leave his bed for at least a week, had asked Mina to look out of the window and tell him if she saw something interesting. She could not see very much though, only the route which the light took, that was emitted by the torches that the crowd had brought. When they were too far away, though, she could not even see that, so she just sat there and waited for something to happen. Neither Ben nor Mina talked very much during the time they waited, but they knew that they were thinking about the same thing: What if there were no children, because the woman had been innocent? What if they did find the children and they were all like Tom had been during the past days, for the rest of their lifes? Was the magic of a witch broken when she was killed? And what if they found the children but they were dead? About three hours after Mina had lost sight of the crowd's light, the doctor returned. Mina had not seen him, as he had been carrying no light, but she heard someone enter the house and then a loud cry from Mrs Weiser. She exchanged a look with Ben and hurried to the door of the room, where she stopped abruptly. There on the floor lay Mrs Weiser, crying and sobbing uncontrollably, the doctor kneeling beside her, trying to comfort her. There was no Tom to be seen. Mina went back to Ben, who only needed one look at her face to know that he would not see his brother that night. Although he tried to suppress them, the tears started coming. It was the same with Mina, who had resumed her seat at the window and now sat crying into her apron. They stayed like that, listening to the slowly ebbing sobs of Mrs Weiser, until Ben spoke up. \"It is my fault, everything is my fault, I should have gone straight to my mother or any other adult, how could I be so stupid? If Tom stays lost, or is found somewhere, dead, that will be my fault. I should have followed him, why did I have to hit my stupid useless head and collapse? I am a man, I should be able to withstand this little bit of pain! I am such an idiotic weakling…\" Mina went over to him, sat down at the side of his bed and took his hands into hers, before she answered: \"You are not weak, Ben, really. The cut on your head is really bad; when they found you, they said that it was astounding that you were even able to walk this far, especially because you are still a child. And just imagine if you had been able to follow Tom, and he really went to a witch's lair, do you really think, the witch would have handed him back to you and let both of you go? She would have killed you both, and your mother would have lost both her children and would probably die from grieve. You are not weak, or stupid, and it is not your fault Tom is gone. It was very courageous of you to follow him into the dark forest, trying to hold him back, but if he really had been cursed, there is no way you or anyone could have managed that. No one believes that anything that happened was your fault, so you should not be so hard on yourself. I know you miss him and are worried, I am too, even though I do not really know him, but you will not get any better when you get all agitated, you will only make yourself really sick. The only thing you should worry about right now is to get well again.\" Looking at the floor she added, slightly mumbling: \"I could not stand losing you, too, because, for me you are the little brother I never had\", to which Ben replied that Mina was the best sister anyone could hope to have and that he hoped that she and the doctor would stay, even if Tom never came back home.[Chapter 9] It had been two months after Tom's disappearance and the killing of the supposed witch and her husband, but still there were no signs of the lost children. Several search-parties had skimmed the woods during daytime, but they never found anything. Everyone knew that the children probably were dead and that the witch that was really responsible for this was still alive and free, but the families of the children desperately held on to the last bit of hope they had. Mrs Weiser, who had always been rather skinny, had lost a lot of weight out of sorrow and now spent most of the day lying in her bed, unable to do much. She barely ate anything and during the time she spent out of bed she was sitting in a chair at the window, as if she were expecting Tom to simply walk down the street. Ben was feeling well again, but he no longer was the happy boy he had been before. There was so much weighing on his young mind: Tom and the other eleven missing children that probably were dead (he was quite sure about it), the feeling that his mother might not make it through the winter, all the innocent women that were burned, and his desire to kill all the evil witches regularly kept him awake. He had tried to occupy his mind by helping the doctor and Mina with their patients, but there was very little to do for him and he was not nearly as natural at this as Mina was. So, in order to earn at least a little bit of money and to have the feeling of not being completely useless, Ben started doing small jobs for the people in the city, like swiping the floor of some small shops, carrying groceries, or delivering messages. He did not earn much, but at least it gave him something to do. Of course he also looked after his mother, together with Mina and the doctor. Every night Ben would be found sitting at his mother's bedside, telling her about his day while he tried to coax some food and water into her. Sometimes he felt as though whatever had been wrong with Tom after the first time he had been gone had gone over to his mother. The only difference was that she would sometimes take Ben's face in her hands and start crying while she made him promise to stay safe, because he was the only thing she had left. Then one day a strange story was spreading around town. Two orphaned children, brother and sister, had arrived. They claimed that they had been held captive by a witch in the forest for two months, but when she wanted to cook and eat the boy, the girl had managed to free herself and attacked the witch with a knife. Together they managed to push the witch into the fire of her oven, where she died. Since then they had been wandering through the forest until they finally made it to the town. Ben really wanted to meet them; persons who had actually escaped and killed a real witch! Unfortunately, Ben's mother had suddenly become very ill. Actually it only was a normal cold, but due to the fact that Mrs Weiser had not been in a good state before, her chances were bad. She now ate even less than before and could not even move out of bed. The doctor tried everything, but as his patient would not get better, he told Ben that his mother was very likely to die. To the doctor's astonishment, Ben did not react like other children would have done, when they heard about the very probable death of one of their parents: He did not cry at all, he only looked at the doctor, said that he had known that this had to happen sooner or later and asked whether he was allowed to sit with her until her time had come, which the doctor did not deny him.[Chapter 10] Ben had decided that his mother should have as much comfort as he could give her during her last days. He took some of the money he had earned and went to the market to buy some of the things his mother had enjoyed, but rarely was able to afford: Apples, some nuts and a tiny bit of gingerbread. He would have brought her some flowers, but as they were nearing December, there were not many and those that were there were far too expensive for his few savings. However, every afternoon Ben would now slice up one apple, open up a few nuts and cut a small piece of gingerbread, which he would take to his mother's room. The first few times Ben had actually managed to coax some of the food into her, she had eaten the whole piece of gingerbread, the nuts and one half of the apple. She even seemed to smile slightly at Ben, although he might just have imagined this. The appetite for those delicacies did not last long though, and Mrs Weiser also started eating less of those, until she would not eat any of this food, either. That was when Ben actually did start crying. Even though he had known it for a while, and the doctor telling him so had been no surprise, he now felt that he started to understand what it meant that his mother was dying, that she would be gone. There would be no more warm hugs from her, no scolding over torn clothes, no tending to scraped knees and elbows, no more good-night kisses and no gentle hand to stroke his head when he was ill. He would no longer sit on the chair at her bedside, telling her about his day, while he tried to make her eat something. She would be gone, and all that was left of her were some items and memories. There would be so many memories, but even the happy ones would turn sad, because the person they concerned was unreachable. Ben did not realise that Mina had entered the room, so he jumped, when her hand touched his arm. She held a bowl of soup in her hand and smiled warmly at him. \"I knew that this bothered you more than you would admit. It is okay to cry though; you should not keep everything in. If you want to talk about it to me, I would be happy to listen to you. But first you have to eat something.\" Ben wiped the tears off his face and wordlessly took the bowl Mina had offered him. \"I never knew my mother, you know, or my father,\" Mina spoke up, looking at Ben, \"but your mother was exactly what I imagined a mother to be. She was so nice to me; ever since we came here she treated me like her own daughter. It is really sad that she has to leave this world so early. And you… you are still so young, only 9 years old, and you have to cope with all those losses… First your brother, now your mother… This is just not fair…\" Mina was interrupted by the noise of Ben's bowl hitting the wooden floor. Only seconds after that Ben ran out of the door. Mina wanted to go after him, but he already returned, followed by the doctor, who went straight to Mrs Weiser and checked first her breath, then her heartbeat. Apparently, he could not find either, because he started pressing her chest quickly with both of his hands, only stopping to listen. All the while Ben and Mina stood there, not knowing what to do. Mina had gone over to Ben and put an arm around him. She softy tried to get him to walk out of the room, but he would not be moved. He stared at his mother and the doctor, who was still pressing and listening, pressing and listening… After what felt like an eternity, the doctor stopped and closed Mrs Weiser's eyes.[Chapter 11] The day of the funeral was cold, grey, and rainy, yet quite a lot of people attended it. Mrs Weiser had always been friendly and always helped wherever she could, so the number of people who had liked her, and now felt sad about her passing, was not small. After the service some of them, mainly neighbours, came over, bringing some food and something to drink, to sit together and remember the deceased. Ben knew that this was a custom, but he wished they would just go away and leave him alone. He had enough of the sad looks they were giving him all the time and of being told, what a poor, good and brave little boy he was, before they started ignoring him again – he, as a child was not a suitable conversational partner for an adult, after all, in their eyes. When the guests were gone, Ben silently went up to his mother's room and sat down on the bed, thoughts swirling through his mind. What would become of him, now that he was alone? Would he be sent to an orphanage, where he would stay until he was old enough to start to work somewhere? Orphans had to take any position offered to them, and those were usually the lowliest paid and most dangerous jobs, that no parent wanted their child to take. If an orphan died, he or she would not be missed, maybe by one or two other children from the orphanage, but no one else would care. So, if he really went there, the probability of his survival was low and the life he would lead was far from enjoyable. After he had lost his mother and brother, he would lose everything else, too, all because of those stupid witches. Witches. It was all their fault: If they had not abducted – and very probably killed – his brother, his mother would not have become sick and would not have died yet, and he would not be sent to an orphanage, meaning that his life would probably end soon, too. Ben's sadness now made room for anger and hate towards those creatures. He remembered the two children that had been in town when his mother fell sick, they had escaped and killed a witch and were not much older than he was. They had been called to another town, though, to rescue another child, so he could not reach them now. He would have loved to talk to them, to ask them how exactly they killed that witch and whether they could teach him, too. A knock on the door threw him out of his thoughts. When he answered, Mina came in and told him that the doctor would like to see him. When Ben entered his office, he was sitting at his desk, working on some document. He only looked up, to tell Ben to take a seat and wait a few seconds. While he waited, Ben looked around. The office was not very large and quite untidy. Books were lying nearly everywhere, medical instruments on top of them and the shelves were full of flasks and pots filled with herbs and liquids. There also was a slight smell of ether in the air, coming from a piece of cloth that lay on the table. Finally the doctor put away his feather and looked at Ben. \"So, Benjamin, I know that the last few months have been very hard for you, but nevertheless this needs to be done, better earlier than later. You have no living relatives to look after you, but someone has to take care of you.\" Ben knew what was coming. His mother was not resting under the earth for a day and he, Ben, would be sent to an orphanage. He tried to hide his feelings, though, and kept looking at the doctor, who continued talking. \"There would be the option of sending you to an orphanage, but as I have seen quite a lot of those, I know that no child should be sent there. Therefore, I would like to adopt you and send you to school, so – \"Here the doctor was interrupted by Ben, who, in a rush of joy, had jumped from his chair and was now hugging the doctor. He let go as suddenly as he had hugged him, obviously shocked of the behaviour he had just displayed. He mumbled a short excuse and, flushing, returned to his seat. The doctor, who was quite amused by this small emotional outburst, now continued with a smile. \"Well, it seems, as if you have no objections to this, so I will go and sign as your guardian tomorrow. Afterwards I will enrol you at school; you will be going there every day from next week on, and I expect you to work hard. You may go now.\" Ben assured the doctor that he would indeed work hard and thanked him, more formally this time, before he went out of the room. He had just closed the door, when he was pulled into a hug. Mina had stood behind the door all the time, listening to every word that had been said and was now smiling as much as she had never done before. She looked as happy as Ben felt, now that they both knew that they would not lose the person they each had adopted as family.[Chapter 12] During the next few days Ben and Mina were very busy. Ben needed to get his school equipment and also some decent every-day clothes. The doctor had trusted Mina to go with Ben and do all the necessary shopping and even allowed them to get something nice for themselves. So after they had bought a few bottles of ink, some quills, a little book to write in, two pairs of trousers, and two new shirts, they strolled over the market, stopping at different stands and trying to decide what they wanted to spend their money on. In the end they settled for some sweet chestnuts, to warm them up on their way home. They had quite a good time together, talking about the things that would come and how happy they were, that they were to stay together for now. Mina was just telling Ben about her plans to sew him a school bag, when she realised that he was not next to her anymore. She looked around and found him looking at a yellowish piece of paper that was stuck to a wall a few metres behind her. On her arrival she could see what it was: one of the last posters of the missing children, telling the people to pass any valuable information to the sheriff at once. Ben had noticed the weathered poster out of the corner of his eye, but it had made his heart sink immediately. He was once more reminded of his brother and the other children that would probably never return to their families. Helplessness mixed with anger welled up inside him and he had to concentrate very much to hold the angry tears back. Only when he felt a small hand on his shoulder did Ben turn from the poster. Mina was standing next to him, looking at the poster with a sad expression before she also turned away and they continued their way back home. The rest of the walk was not as cheerful as it had been before, as both, Ben and Mina, were lost in their thoughts. \"Someday, when I am grown up, I will find those witches and kill them.\" Ben suddenly spoke up. \"Don't be ridiculous Ben\" replied Mina, \"nobody can kill a witch. Although I would love to get rid of them, too.\" \"You know that there are exactly two people, children even, who killed and escaped a witch. So it can be done, but I need to know how\", countered Ben. Mina had already suspected that he would bring the topic of the siblings up. She had been quite fascinated by their story, too, but she had not seen them, either, she only felt a lot of pity for those poor children, who were just about her own age but already had to experience something so horrible. The first day of school had finally arrived for Ben. He had been very excited and hardly able to sleep, scared that he might oversleep and be late on his first day. When he entered the kitchen, he found that Mina had already prepared the breakfast and even packed a little bit of lunch for him. After he had gorged down his porridge, Ben waited impatiently, checking again and again whether he had everything he needed, until it was finally time to go. He had to walk quite a while to get to the school, but he knew the way well and arrived early. Some other boys were already there, talking, playing and chasing each other around. None of them even seemed to notice Ben, and he was quite happy for that, as he suddenly felt very shy and self-conscious. When the lessons started, Ben was introduced to his class by his teacher, Dr. Harmann. To his own astonishment, Ben had less difficulty following the lessons than he had feared, and he even managed to answer a question correctly, which made him at least a tiny bit surer of himself. When the bell rang for the break, some of the boys came over to him and asked him whether he would like to join in their game of tag. Happy about the fact that he would not have to spend the break standing on his own, Ben accepted the invitation. He quickly learned, that he was not the only boy at school, who was send there by a benefactor, and found out, that one of the boys, Markus, was even living near him. When the day at school had ended, Ben had not only overcome the slight fear, that he would have a very hard time at school, but he had also found some friends. From then on, Markus and Ben walked to and from school together everyday, did their homework together and played. Markus had lost a sibling to the witches, too, so he could understand why Ben wanted to kill them so badly. Although he said he could never bring up the courage to go near a witch, he spent hours helping Ben, who had decided that he wanted to try and find out as much as possible about the siblings and their work, searching through old newspapers, cutting relevant articles out and putting them into a large book. Mina helped them, when she had the time, mainly because she saw how much it meant to Ben, but also, because she realised how Markus started blushing and behaving ridiculously, when she was around, which amused her a little. All in all, better times promised to come for Ben and his little family.[Chapter 13] It happened during the first days of spring. A father and his son were on their way back from sowing peas out in the fields, when they were attacked by a witch. She took the child with her and knocked the father out, when he tried to fight her. Of course, when the man returned home, no one really wanted to believe his story, as no one wanted to believe that the horrors were starting again. The man was taken into custody and questioned what he had done to his son. As he would neither admit that he had killed the boy, nor where the boy was now, he was sentenced to death by hanging. There were only two people in all of Augsburg who at least partially believed that man. As soon as Ben and Mina heard about the boy that was lost, they started looking for clues, especially ones that shouted witch. Ben had collected a vast amount of material about witches, their practices and all of the articles about the two witch-hunters that he could get his hands on. The articles were all chronologically and neatly stuck into a book, an idea that he had got from his friend Markus, who now lived in another town, and Ben planned to show them to the siblings, if he should ever be lucky enough to meet them. Ben and Mina still lived in their childhood house. After Ben had finished school, he had started to learn everything that was possible from the doctor, so he could continue his work, when the doctor was gone. Mina, who knew quite a bit more about medicine, helped him as much as she could without being suspicious. Although there were some rumours, the two of them never had any romantic feelings for each other. Ben had a crush on the female witch-hunter, Gretel, although he had never seen her. He had even painted a picture of her, which he put up in his room, and with which Mina teased him quite often. Mina said she was waiting for the right man to come along, but in reality there were no men that were interested in taking her as a wife. She was not ugly, her beauty was talked about by many men and even women, but they all did not want a wife that seemed to be intelligent – maybe even more intelligent than the men themselves. There even were rumours that she might be a half-witch, because of the touch of red in her hair, which made it strawberry-blonde, but as nothing had happened since the children were abducted ten years ago, those rumours seemed to prove wrong. However, the case of the lost boy was not meant to be the only one. Two weeks after the hanging of the man, another boy did not return home after he was off, playing with some children. Then there was a girl, only two days later, who disappeared only a short way from home. After two more children had been abducted and everyone who had seen witnessed anything stated that there were witches involved, both the mayor and the sheriff started to get the uneasy feeling that the man had told the truth before. The guards were doubled, parents were advised not to leave their children unattended and every woman, especially the ones that were not married or lived alone, was observed by their neighbours. Those measures did not help very much, though; during the next two months there were four more children that were taken. Everything seemed to start again; there were innocent women, young and old, burning on the stake or drowned. The atmosphere was full of mistrust; it seemed as if everyone was followed by whispered rumours. Then one day the mayor announced that there was some hope in sight, as he had asked the two witch-hunters to come to Augsburg and get rid of the witch plague for them. The sheriff was not very happy about that, as he did not trust them. Those people, who had escaped witches almost unharmed, could mean nothing good. The opinion among the citizens was just as split: Some were happy that they were getting help; others rather feared that the witch-hunters could bring even more bad luck. When Ben heard the news, he was almost ecstatic. Finally he would have the chance to meet his heroes! Maybe he could even help them defeat the witches and bring the children back? Maybe he could find out what had happened to his brother so many years ago? There was still one week to go, though, and he feared that a lot could happen until then.[Chapter 14] There were still two days to go until the witch-hunters were scheduled to arrive, when Mina came home, looking scared and slightly tousled, and locked the door behind her, before she sank down, crying. Ben, who had appeared in the room, hurried over to her and moved her to a chair. When he had made her a cup of strong tea, he kneeled in front of her, took her hands in his and tried to get her to tell what had happened. At first, she did not say anything, but when she had calmed down a little, she started to talk. She had been to the market to get some food, when she encountered Sheriff Berringer, who started questioning her about what she was doing out there, all on her own, whether she did not know, that she looked quite suspicious. When he had finished his inquiry, she started the way home, when she suddenly, in a small alley, was shoved against a wall by someone. It was no other than Berringer, who had followed her. He came close and hissed into her ear that he knew that she was innocent; but that he could make the people believe that she was the one who had brought all of those bad things over Augsburg. Of course he would reconsider it, if she behaved well. Mina knew, what the sheriff had in mind, and she also knew that the people would most gladly believe that she was the culprit, now that another child had gone missing, only two days ago. On the other hand, she knew that the sheriff, unlike the mayor, was not a noble man, in fact, he was just as bad as any drunkard, when it came to the treatment of women, and she feared that even if she did what he wanted, he would still bring her to the stake. She told him that she was not scared of him and that she would never do what he wanted. That infuriated Berringer, and he hit her head on the wall, before he came even closer, starting to grab and touch her everywhere. At that point Mina's self-preservation kicked in, and she pushed the sheriff away, with a strength that she did not believe she had, before she rammed her knee right between his legs. She used the moment in which he was diverted and ran as fast as she could, always throwing glances behind her. When Ben had heard this story, he was so angry, he could have marched up to the sheriff and killed him with his bare hands. It was only due to Mina's pleas that he stayed there with her. All evening they talked about what to do next, before they developed a plan. They would leave at midnight and take as many small streets as possible. If there was someone asking where they went, they would go to a family living outside of town, which had sent for them. They were still packing the last things, when the front door burst open and the sheriff entered with four of his men. Two of them grabbed Mina by the arms and the other two held Ben down, who had tried to attack the men holding Mina. When he would not stay still, one of them hit the handle of his gun over Ben's head. Although everything was blurred now, Ben could see Mina's arms reaching out for him, as she was dragged away by the sheriff's men. Ben wanted to yell after her that he would find a way to get her out of there, but he felt too dizzy to speak. The next morning, Ben woke up with a huge headache. His body did not feel much better, as he had been lying on the floor all night, but at least his vision had returned to normal again. Slowly, the events of the night came back to him. They had wanted to leave, but Mina had been taken prisoner by the sheriff. Suddenly Ben was wide awake. He had promised Mina to protect her from that monster of a sheriff, and he would, or his name was not Benjamin Weiser. In front of the local court, a huge crowd had gathered. Ben, who, in his desire to help Mina, had forgotten to have breakfast, quickly grabbed a bottle of milk from the milkman's stand and made his way to the front row of the crowd. Sure enough, there was Mina, and she was still alive. He did not know, whether she could see him, and it would have been quite stupid to call her, so he had to develop the rescue plan by himself. He concentrated as well as he could, and tried to block the noise of Mina's head being held underwater, but he simply found nothing he could do, which did not involve getting both of them killed. He was almost despairing, when the crowd suddenly gasped. Fearing, that Mina had died, he looked up, just to see a dark-haired woman holding a huge gun against the sheriff's head, and telling him to let the woman go, or she would shoot him. When he looked on, he saw that the sheriff's men were kept in check by another man. Ben knew, who the two of them were, before the woman introduced them: Hansel and Gretel, the witch-hunters. His heroes had finally arrived, so, everything would turn out good now, right? ","Summary":" Ben`s father had left him, his mother and his older brother Tom before he had even been born. So it"},{"Movie":"Karate Kid","Title":"End Of The Line","Author":"BrunetteMarionette","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10475480","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"This is it. This is the end of the line\" Well this is it, the day of the 'Big Move' me, my mom and twin brother Daniel are moving from Newark, New Jersey to Reseda, a neighbourhood in Los Angeles, California. Me and Daniel are seniors in high school and our mom is trying for a new job in some computer thing. \"you're telling me\" Daniel muttered to himself as he sat still in his seat not wanting to get out. I look out of the window of my mom's 1969 Chevy station wagon, which was so beyond repair, I saw nothing but palm trees and coconuts which means eternal summer which I love, I love the warm breeze, never being cold even at night and the long days but being half Italian its nothing unusual to love the summer unless your Daniel who likes the winter. \"Come on all hands on deck\" mom promoted us as we got out off the car to start unpacking, Daniel struggling with his bike and me grabbing the luggage. \" we gotta get this thing unloaded before it sinks\" she joked. I could see mom looking up at the sky smiling and smiled a bit to myself, she's finally happy with her life no looking back now. \"Look at those palm trees! Damn, do you know what that means?\" she called out to us excitedly but some of us aren't as excited as she is. Daniel looks bored and unenthusiastic as he struggles with his bike but still looks up at the palm trees at the instance of our mother. \" Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts\" he replied sarcastically making me roll my eyes. \"Wise guy, No more Newark winters!\" I could help but smile at the thought but I knew my twin would have something to say about that. \"I like winters ma\" he replied to her like he was talking to a child making me giving him a dark glare. \"I don't\" I replied bluntly giving him a challenging look. \"Oh, you like sore throats? You like frozen toes?\" Mom asked rhetorically winking at me as she knew she was always right. \"I don't like smog\" Daniel replied in the same reprimanding tone. Mom picked up one of the smaller boxes with the laundry stuff in it and gave us both a look. \"Did I tell you about the pool here?\" she asked trying to bait us into being happy with uprooting our lives, Daniel with his wierdo girlfriend Judy and me living a happy life of solitude and peace. \"Just about 100 times ma\" I told her rolling my eyes, nothing could get my mom down from this happy high she really thinks this is the best day of her life but nothing ever goes to plan for the LaRusso family. \"Okay, so make it 101\" She laughed walking towards the worn looking apartment complex \"Open your eyes, my darling twins. This is the Garden of Eden\". \"Come on. Listen, we're in apartment 20 okay? One flight up\" she shouted to us walking to our new 'home'. Me and Daniel didn't speak much less look at each other as we grabbed our own luggage, I saw him struggling to carry his bike and suitcase but I didn't offer to help as me and my older twin hadn't been the best of siblings for a long time. Daniel thought I was too much like our runaway father who was a horrible and abusive man to our mom and I thought Daniel was too weak, often cared about people to much and is always sticking his nose into other peoples business. I shut the car doors whilst Daniel pushed his ratty bike into the apartment complex I heard him yell and then a big bang, I turned to see he had kicked the wooden door open but not only that he had kicked it into someone's face. I snorted to myself but still ran over to see what was happening. \"Are you okay?\" I heard Daniel stutter and apologize to the stranger who was now sprawled out on the floor holding his nose which wasn't bleeding...unfortunately. \"Don't worry about it\" the guy laughed still tending to his wounds which you couldn't see anyway. \"Let me help you up\" my twin said still stuttering trying to hold his bike and help the stranger off the floor where he had unintentionally kicked him. \"Thanks\" the guy said still laughing which was starting to confuse me a little but I could see it shook Daniel up as he was still stuttering and looking embarrassed. \"I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid\" Daniel said trying to justify his actions. \"You must be the new people in 20 right?\" the stranger asked his rubbing his head. \"Yeah, I guess so\" Daniel answered looking up at our apartment. \"Freddy Fernandez, apartment 17\" he told us shaking Daniels hand, smiling which showed his dimples. \"Daniel LaRusso\" he told Freddy, to which Freddy looked at me as If just noticing I was here. I shook my head \"What?\" \"This is my twin, Katherine\" Daniel told him \"It's Kat actually\" I butted in rudely not sure if I liked Freddy or not. \"How you doing? Let me help\" he said grabbing the suitcase from Daniels bike and the heavier one from me which I gladly gave him but it looks like st. Daniel has a problem with him helping me. \"No, it's fine. It's heavy, man\" Daniel said embarrassed at the help but Freddy still took the suitcase. Daniel gave me an annoyed look at my willingness of letting Freddy help to which I just shrugged my shoulders. \"I got it\" Freddy told him still looking at me smiling. \"So twins, that must be cool\" he asked us smiling. \"not really\" I told him shaking my head and seeing Daniel frown at me again, Freddy started to look uncomfortable with my short answers and unwillingness to talk to him so he turned to Daniel instead for conversation which is definitely fine with me. \"Where are you from?\" he asked Daniel as we started walking to our new apartment. \"New Jersey\" Daniel replied nonchalantly, Freddy chucked a bit and I didn't know whether I should take offence or not that he was laughing about where we were from. \"What are you doing out here?\" he inquired again, making me realise I really don't like small talk. You would think that all my negativity would depress me but it really doesn't, I like being a lone wolf. \"Our mom got a job with some company out here. Rocket Computers. Flight of the Future. I don't know\" my twin told him not knowing the actual details of our mom's new job, actually that's all we knew before she shipped us out her. \"I never heard of it\" Freddy laughed again as we passed the pool which wasn't a pool as much as it was a puddle. I snorted unladylike at him and said \"i'm not surprised\" Daniel had just noticed the pool at the same time as I did and didn't look impressed, funny it the only thing we've agreed on in months other than this move. \" Is this the only pool you've got?\" Freddy nodded his head but look disinterested \"That's it. What was that, karate?\" he asked my brother excitedly. \"Yeah.\" I looked at Daniel with a raised eyebrow when he said this. \"Have you been doing it long?\" Freddy started to look really excited now when Daniel said he knew karate. \"Yeah, a while\" my brother lied making me laugh, Daniel looked at me with begging eyes as if to ask me not to tell Freddy the truth which was that he had gone to a few classes at the Y. \"Did you ever use it?\" i'm starting to think that Freddy was only talking to Daniel because of his 'Karate' skills. \"A couple of times\" he told him quietly still not knowing if I was going to rat him out but I wasn't he can learn the hard way of his lies. \"I bet you could kick some ass\" Not likely, Daniel was usually on the other end of the ass kicking mostly by me. Me and my brother do get into physical fights with each other but i'm usual the one winning. \" I'd like to learn that. Maybe you could teach me\" ah the light begins to dawn, Freddy just wanted Daniel to teach him karate. \"Sure. That's cool. Any time\" Daniel tells him enthusiastic forgetting he doesn't actually know karate and was just saying this to impress his new friend. Just as we reached the stairs to get to the apartment a voice stopped us in our tracks. \"This place is a dump. You should go back to New Jersey\" an old gypsy looking woman told us, she didn't didn't look up whist talking to us as she read her paper. I raised my eyebrow in suspicion and questioned her \"How did you know where we're from?\" she still didn't look at me while I asked her a question i'm not sure if she's rude or introverted. I think she's like me and just doesn't give a damn. \"'Cause I'm from New Jersey. I got a nose for my own\" she explained to us like it was common knowledge that she lived in the same place as us. \"Well what part?\" Daniel questioned her, I looked at Freddy to see him laughing a bit to himself and smiled at me when he noticed I was looking. \"Parsippany\" I heard the gypsy woman telling Daniel \"I never should've left\" \"Our Uncle Louie's from Parsippany\" My twin told her sounding excited, ive never noticed before how much Daniel is like a puppy dog and get excited about everything. \"Louie Martini?\" she asked us looking up for the first time since we started talking to her. I shook my head \"Louie LaRusso\" \"Louie LaRusso? Don't know him\" she waved us off, Daniel had a weird smile on his face which I couldn't place. \"Hey pup\" he said leaning down and petting the little dog that I only just noticed. \"How you doing? You thirsty?\" I saw Freddy tap Daniel on the shoulder and make a sign that the old gypsy woman was crazy he whispered something that we couldn't hear. \"What?\" we asked not quite hearing what he said. \"She's not playing with a full deck\" Freddy explained to us in what seemed to be the nicest way he could. \"She's nice\" I defended, I could be like that old lady one day talking a load if crap and not even giving a shit about what people think of her. Actually thinking about it she kinda reminds me of my aunt tessy. I shivered at the thought. Freddy laughed as if I was joking and Daniel just shook his head smiling. \"What are you two doing tomorrow?\" Freddy asked us whilst helping Daniel up the stairs with his bike. \"I don't know. I guess nothing\" Daniel replied looking at me for confirmation to which I shrugged my shoulders and muttered \"Guess so\". \"We're having a beach party. Want to come?\" he explained excitedly to us but still mainly looking at me which is starting to freak me out, I don't know what the boys are like in LA but i'm not sure I like it. \"Yeah I'll be there\" Daniel told him quickly obviously not wanted to go with me, I ruin most of his friendships and i'm proud of that. \"Sure, that's cool\" I replied with a smile on my face as I see Daniel frowning at me, Freddy grinned widely thinking I was smiling at him. \"I'll come get you in the morning\" he smiled at me and then turn to Daniel quickly \"Both of you\" he stuttered a little. \"Here's apartment 20\" we all looked at the apartment we had stopped outside, mine and Daniel's looks were a bit different to Freddy's We really didn't want to be here but we love our ma so we're trying for her. \"Should I leave this here?\" Freddy gestured to our very heavy suitcases, we both nodded our heads. \"Yeah, thanks for the help\". \"Nice meeting you. Take care\" Freddy said shaking our hands \"See you tomorrow morning\" he said before running back down the stairs obviously going to where he was supposed to be before my brother knocked him over. Daniel opened the door and we both just fell through and before we could say anything or breathe mom to us \"Don't say anything about the pool. I'll call first thing in the morning\" I hadn't really given the pool a second thought, yeah it sounded good having our own pool but we'd have to share with the rest of the complex not my idea of fun. \"Did you tell that old lady where we were from?\" I asked her putting boxes on the floor. Mom turned around quickly with a huge grin on her face \"Yes. Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy?\" Daniel laughed \"More like Uncle Louie\" even I cracked a smile at that one. \"I really think we're going to do good here\" mom told us cleaning \"I have a very positive feeling, I'm telling you kids I just know it's going to work\" how my mother can be so positive at times is beyond me. Daniel grabbed a bowl from the box I was holding and went over to the sink, only to be soaked when the water started to shoot up like a fountain, I laughed at his misfortune. I believe that nothing good can come from doing things for others, my mom just says i'm 'selfish'. Eh tomato, Tomato. \"The faucet's broken\" ma told him after he learnt the hard way. \"The real estate lady said there's a fix-it guy. See if you guys can find him\". I looked at her with wide eyes \" why both of us, why cant he do it\" I argued not wanting to spend anymore time with him then I already had to. Daniel looked me in the eye and teased \"Why, Don't you want to see your lover boy Freddie\" \"he is not my lover boy Daniel\" I told him strongly making him flinch at the sound of my voice but still pushed it further when he told mom that Freddy Fernandez from apartment 17 couldn't stop staring at me with googly eyes. My anger flared and push him \" Don't talk like that, you don't know what your talking about\" Daniel looked at me with scared eyes whilst I could hear my mom shouting at me in the background \" Katherine LaRusso you apologize to your brother right now\". \"Why?\" I asked strongly \"he started it with all his lies\" she just shook her head and explained that Freddy might like me but still made both of us apologize to each other which we did begrudgingly. Daniel grabbed the bowl of water which he managed to catch and walked to the door \"What's that for?\" mom asked trying to change the mood. \"Uncle Louie's dog\" he explained carrying the water. \"He's cute\" she told us, I knew mom would fall in love with the dingy looking dog I mean she did fall for our father. I followed Daniel to the door knowing mom would still make me go with him, its like she still thinks we're 10 years old i'm just glad she doesn't make us hold hands any more. My brother stopped in front of the door and turn to our mom who was busying herself in a box. \"I got invited to a party tomorrow\" he told her \" me too\" I added giving Daniel a look for leaving me out so I wouldn't be able to go. \"Great. You see?\" she told us smiling, looking happy that we had got invited to a party but not asking what type of party it was. \"But you wanted us to help you unpack\" I questioned, pointing to all the stuff in boxes not sure if I was even in the mood to be social tonight. \"I don't remember saying that\" she said and shrugged her shoulders \"I must have had you mixed up with somebody else\" Daniel said smiling at our mom, I walked over and kissed her cheek \"Thanks, Ma\" she grinned at my unusual sign of affection. We ran back down the stairs to where the gypsy woman was still sitting with her dog and paper but she was now smoking a cigarette and still very much reminding me of my Aunt Tessy. \"Could you tell me where the maintenance guy is?\" I asked her nicely and hey she even looked at me this time when I talked to her. \"Hey, pup\" I heard Daniel say and saw him put the bowl down by the hot looking dog to which he happily lapped up the water. \"You go in through there, turn left, not too far...then right, go inside, and you'll find him on the left\" I lost her when she began talking so I hope Daniel was paying attention to what she was saying, Daniel started walking in the direction of what gypsy aunt tessy told us. \" So I go right then left?\" obviously I wasn't the only one who didn't listen. She sighed at us \"No, left then right, then inside on the left\" We walked in the direction she told us and came to a stop a set of wooden green doors. Daniel knocked on the door and opened them to walk through and looked at me to see if I was following. \"Hello?\" he shouted. I looked around at the room and all I could see were bits and pieces its like our maintenance man was a hoarder. Me and Daniel stood side by side at a see through door. \"Are you the maintenance man?\" I asked the man who had his back to us who was doing something with chopsticks. \"We're the new people in apartment\" I told him still not getting any answer from him. Me and Daniel looked at each other annoyed, I put my hands up and gave up on talking to the man. \"Yeah The faucet's really leaking there\" Daniel said opening the door. The man turned around and I could see he was quite old and Korean looking he was also wearing a white & Black bandanna. He gave Daniel a glare and my brother just stared back and started to shut the door again. \"Could you come fix it?\" Daniel asks him quietly. \"Can I tell my mom when?\" he asks again when he got no answer. \"When what?\" the old Korean man asked us, I don't think he's even listening to a word we're saying. Are all the people in LA this rude?. \"When you're going to fix the faucet\" I asked him sharply getting very annoyed at the ignorance of the old man. I tried being polite, I tried being quiet and letting Daniel talk to him but he's really starting to get on my last nerve. \"After\" was his short and sweet reply, well not so sweet. \"After what?\" my brother half shouted starting to get annoyed too. Daniel very rarely gets annoyed like our ma but when they do they go like a volcano. \"After after!\" the old Korean man shouted at us. I through my hands up in the air frustrated again and walked back off to the apartment. I can't be bothered with this crap! Short and Sweet, Hope you like the first chapter of End Of The Line![Chapter 2] It felt like forever before we had got to the beach, Daniel and Freddy hadn't stopped talking since we left and although Freddy had tried to include me in the conversation I wasn't interested in talking to either of them. \"Here we are\" he told us pulling up to the parking lot next to the sand. I jumped out of the car and looked around I could see loads of people doing different stuff on the beach, I grabbed my bag from the car and followed Daniel and Freddy. We walked onto the beach and stopped by 3 boys who were playfully fighting \"Hey guys this is Daniel and Kat. They just moved here\" Freddy told the 3 'guys' who were now looking at us \"Daniel, Kat this is Alan, Chuckie and Billy\" we just kind of nodded to each other. I dropped my bag on the floor and lay out my pink towel just in case I wanted to sunbathe. I could see the boys looking at me except Daniel he was busy looking around. \"Hey Kat, you any good at soccer?\" I looked at Chuckie who was bouncing a soccer ball between his hands, I smirked at him \"I am the best soccer player ever\" the guys laughed taking it as a challenge. I took my Vans, cardigan and shirt off leaving me in my bathing suit and shorts \"Lets do this\". We had been playing for a while until I decided to sit out and let the boys rough around with each other as I lay down I saw them kicking the ball in to some high class looking girls who each threw the ball to each other until the blonde one Daniel had been staring at caught the ball and threw it up to Daniel who began to show off his 'skills' I heard the girls laughing as they walked towards the water still looking back at the boys playing soccer. We stayed at the beach messing around until it grew dark and Freddie decided to make a camp-fire to cook hot dogs. I had put back on my clothes and was currently watching Daniel and blondie making eyes at each other, I smacked his arm and handed him the stick with a hot dog on when Freddie came over \"I think the blonde is looking at you\" I snapped my head over to see that the blonde was most definitely looking at Daniel but he snorted in laughter \"Yeah, Right\" but he was too nervous to look Freddie nudged him again \"I think she has the hots for you\" Daniel stood up still staring at the blonde \"Who could blame her?\" if I were her I would be more worried that some weird kid was starting at me not flattered \"Why don't you make a move?\" I looked at Freddie annoyed \"If you like her so much why don't you make a move?\" Freddie looked shocked that I had said that but Daniel looked a bit relieved that I did and shook his head \"No, I'm eating, man\" the guys all laughed mockingly \"How can you think about eating?\" Alan asked him unbelieving, Daniel just shrugged his shoulders probably feeling shit to all this peer pressure \"I'm hungry\" he mumbled quietly. Chuckie put his hands on Freddie's shoulders and nodded in our direction \"Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey\" I smirked and gave him the finger, Daniel chuckled \"I got moves where I come from\" I snorted in laughter \"Yeah he's got so many moves\" Daniel gave me a dirty look probably because I had embarrassed him in front of his new 'besties'. The boys had starting laughing at Daniel again \"Let's see 'em\" Freddie kicked the ball into the girls and pushed Daniel in their direction \" Alright, Alright I'm going\" Daniel walked over to the preppy girls whom had given the ball to the blonde. I saw them start to talk and could help but stare at them angrily, I saw her try to bounce the ball on her knee trying to keep it up but failed, I felt an arm come around my shoulder and looked to see Freddie \"What's up Kat?\" I just looked at him irritated and shook my head, Freddie looked into the direction I was looking in \"Oh I see, overprotective older sister?\" he asked jokingly drinking from his beer bottle \"Daniel's the older one\" I shook his arm off me and walked over to the fire where everyone was. Every now and again I would look over to them seeing them doing 'cute' things and couldn't help but feel like something bad was going to happen. I shook it off as I heard the sound of a motor rumbling, I looked up to see a group of motorbikes \"Whose that\" I asked nodding in the bikes direction which were now riding in our direction. I saw the guys faces fall \"They're the cobra kai, a group of black belts from our school\" I nodded confused to why they all looked so worried \"Yeah and the leader is blondies ex boyfriend\" I looked up to where Daniel and blondie were canoodling, I saw blondie notice the bikes she looked scared and kicked the ball away from her, Daniel ran after it unknowingly. The 'Cobra Kai' got off their bikes and walked towards blondie as did me and everyone else on the beach. I saw one of the guys in particular walk towards blondie he was also blonde, tall, good looking but seemed pissed off to the max \"That's Johnny Lawrence\" I heard Freddie whisper to me, he told me the names of the others but I was too busy watching them like a hawk. I could hear Johnny trying to talk over blondies radio \" Ali, I want to talk to you\" Oh so her name is Ali, she looked upset and shook her head \"Leave me alone. We've been over all this. I don't want to talk\" Johnny leant forward \"I want to talk to you, all right?\" Stubbornly Ali turned the radio back on so johnny turned it back off \" What is your problem?\" he asked her softly but she just looked at him angrily \" Why Don't you just take your little Cobra Kai's and get out of here\" honestly I think she was being a bitch but I Don't know their history so I wont judge... just yet. Ali stood up and grabbed her radio, johnny stood up and grabbed it from her obviously trying to get her attention \"and that's going to solve everything\" Ali tried to grab her radio from johnny again \"give me my radio\" she asked twice trying to take it back. \"You promise you'll talk to me\" the poor lad just seemed like he wanted to sort out some of their relationship problems, I felt someone stand next to me and looked to see Daniel stood by me with the soccer ball tucked under his arm. I looked back over to see Johnny giving Ali back her radio to which she turned it back on and seemingly angering Johnny who grabbed it and smashed it on the floor. \"You just broke my radio!\" Ali screamed pushing Johnny angrily, I felt Daniel move beside me and grabbed his arm but he brushed me off and bent down to pick up Ali's radio \"Don't touch it, punk\" Johnny shouted at Daniel who picked it up anyway and tried handing it to Ali but Johnny grabbed it from him \"You want it?\" he asked Daniel sarcastically and pushed it hard into Daniel's chest making him fall over. I saw Johnny push Ali into his friends who held her so she couldn't get to Johnny. As Daniel got up I stood in front of him \"Don't do this Daniel they will kick your ass\" I heard some of the guys laughing behind me even the guys who we were hanging with earlier. Daniel pushed me out of the way embarrassed but I grabbed him and spun him to face me \"If you do this don't come crying to me I'm not helping you this time\" Daniel looked angry at me \"Like you would anyway you're a bitch to me all the time\" I knew he was angry, embarrassed and hurt but I couldn't let him get away with calling me a bitch \"Fine\" I looked behind him to see an amused Johnny \"Kick his ass\" I told him walking away. Daniel turned to look at Johnny who was laughing and ran for him but Johnny sidestepped and tripped him \"Johnny, stop it. Stop it\" Johnny looked at her laughing \"I didn't do anything\" before turning around kicking Daniel in the stomach. I winced that's going to hurt tomorrow. Johnny turned to Ali \"You started this, All I wanted to do was talk to you\" he turned and walked to Daniel \"What about you hero you had enough?\" Daniel quickly punched Johnny in the nose and stood up looking scared \" Come on man, now we're even\" but Johnny wasn't having it he looked like he was going to kill that stupid brother of mine \"No mercy, man\" he kicked Daniel in the stomach, face and then hit him in the head. Ali had broken away and starting hitting Johnny \"Why don't you hit me?\" Johnny just pushed her away \"It's your fault!\" he told her and I agree with him fully, if she had talked to him may brother wouldn't have had his ass kicked. \"Ever think it's yours?Why do you always have to fight?\" Johnny looked like he had had enough and shook his head waving to his friends \"Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys\" The boys and Freddie looked at Daniel lying in the sand groaning in pain \"You sure pick cool people to be friends with\" Chuckie said sarcastically to Freddie but jumped seeing me looking at him \"Except you Kat you're cool\" I smiled at him sardonically \"Great\". Alan was shaking his head \"Where'd you find this guy?\" I just looked at Freddie \"Come on, let's go. He'll be all right\" they all looked at me shocked \"What\" I shrugged Ali gave me the dirtiest look I'd ever seen but I let it roll off me, I wasn't bothered by her \"You're just going to leave him here hurt\" she asked me upset, again I shrugged my shoulders \"The boy has to learn when to pick his fights and not try to be a hero to some blonde damsel in distress, which might I add was all her fault\" I said uncaring. She turned to Daniel and knelt by him touching his shoulder \"Are you okay?\" she asked him quietly. Daniel coughed pushed her hand away \"Just leave me alone\" Ali looked upset that he wanted her to leave \"I'll help you\" she said trying to move him making Daniel groan in pain \"Leave me alone. I'm okay\" he told her breathlessly, Johnny must have done some real damage. Ali's friend grabbed her shoulder and pulled her away from Daniel \"Come on, Ali. Let's go. It's better if you leave him alone\" Hearing a roar of their engine we turned to see the cobra Kai get on their bikes and sped away, their bike wheels flicking sand onto Daniel. I felt Freddie grab my arm I sighed hard knowing I couldn't leave Daniel here no matter how stupid I thought he had been plus mom would kill me if I left him here. \"Just go\" I told Freddie walking towards Daniel whom let me pull him up but Freddie shook his head \"I'll take you both home anyway\" I snorted in amusement \"how noble of you\" I walked Daniel over to Freddie's car grabbing my stuff on the way, I put him into the back seat and got into the front with Freddie, the ride home was a lot quieter than the ride here. We got to the apartment complex I got out to get Daniel to which Freddie helped but I pushed him away and half carried my brother into the apartment hoping Ma wasn't awake. We walked through the door and Ma was nowhere to be seen, I shut the door and walked to my room leaving Daniel in the living/dining room area I turned to look at him \"Never do something stupid like that again especially when I tell you not to\" I then turned to go into my room to sleep. I hope Daniel has a good lie for ma in the morning I thought falling asleep. I woke up hearing Ma shouting mine and Daniel's names so I showered before Daniel could, as I got out of the shower and opened the door I jumped seeing Daniel outside of the door but then laughed when I saw his face he pushed me out of the way. I laughed all the way to my room wondering how he was going to cover this up. I turned to my wardrobe which mom had obviously packed with all of my clothes for me and put on a pair of jeans, Vans and a red off the shoulders top. When I was ready I packed my backpack with my sports kit the school had sent for me and Daniel, I walked out into the kitchen where mom was cooking happily \"Morning ma\" I said to her nicely as she put food on the plate for me and kissing my head \"Morning sweetheart, you look nice\" I smiled at her and started munching on a piece of toast waiting for Daniel to appear. \"Daniel!\" ma shouted Daniel came out of his room dressed for school with a pair of sunglasses on. \"Morning honey, how was the party?\" she asked us I looked at Daniel with a raised eyebrow \"It was okay\" he muttered quietly, Ma laughed \"Must have been more than okay. I didn't hear either of you come in\" I smirked knowing why she didn't hear us. \"Any friend material?\" she asked Daniel knowing I wouldn't have made any friends, I laughed out loud \"Oh yeah Daniel made loads of friends\" ma looked at me suspicious but Daniel just turned and grabbed his bag \"I got to go\" ma looked unhappy at this \"Sit down and eat first\" she said putting scrambled egg on his plate, Daniel grabbed a piece of toast \"I'm not hungry\". I got up with my bag and followed Daniel to the door \"Do me a favour. Take off the glasses\" Daniel looked at ma shocked she asked him that \"Why?\" ma just smiled at him but I knew she wouldn't be smiling for long. \"Because I asked you to. I want to see your baby browns\" I felt a jealous streak go through me my eyes are blue like our dads, mom never asks to see my eyes. I felt Daniel stiffen next to me \"ma come on with the baby browns\" he told her irritated but mom started to look suspicious \"Are you on something?\" I snorted in amusement our mother thinks Daniel is on drugs she is definitely a stereotypical Italian mother \"Yeah I'm on Minute Maid\" he said trying to open the door but mom just wont give up \"Why hide your eyes?\" Daniel looked like he was struggling to lie to ma \"I'm not\" ma didn't look like she believed him \"Take off the glasses\" Daniel tried arguing with her \"Now!\" she shouted I lifted my hand up and whipped of his glasses making mom gasp in shock \"My God! How did that happen?\" Ma ran over and started looking at the bruises that covered Daniels face \"I hit a kerb with my bike. I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry. It looks worse than it feels\" he said touching his swollen eye and the bruises, mom brushed his hands away from his face \"Don't do that. Can you see? You want to stay home?\" she asked lovingly \"I want to stay home\" I said waving my hand into the air, mom shook her head at me and looked back at 'her boy' seemingly ignoring me \"We've got to go\" I told mom stoically before Daniel could answer I grabbed him and pushed him through the door. I hopped off the bus noticing Daniel locking up his bike and walked towards him, I still hadn't forgiven him for calling me a bitch but getting his ass kicked in front of a girl he likes was good enough for me. I was stood next to Daniel but he hadn't noticed me he was looking in the opposite direction, I looked over to see what caught his attention and I saw those Cobra Kai's \"Don't get in their way and you'll be fine\" Daniel jumped at the sound of my voice and I grimaced at his face \"You look like shit\" he snorted \"Thanks sis\" I sighed helping him with his bike \"Daniel why don't you listen to me?\" he looked at me seriously \"Ma let dad 'help' her and look where that got us\" my grip tightened on the bike and I puffed in anger \"Don't compare me to him\" Daniel look scare like he always does when he compares me to our father. \"Hey, the karate kid\" I blanched hearing Freddie's and the other guys voices from yesterday they were not in my friend book to say the least. Daniel tried to smile at them but was still upset from yesterday. Chuckie started doing some 'karate' moves at Daniel \"Let's see the moves. He knows how to get his butt kicked\" I looked at my brothers face and just saw embarrassment as they laughed, I looked around to see people coming nearer to us to see what was happening I was surprised to see the Cobra Kai looking at us. \"I already know that move\" Freddie said laughing, Daniel ran of towards school in embarrassment but that didn't stop Freddie from laughing, I grabbed him by the collar and pushed him up against the wall \"Hey Kat, what are you doing\" he asked me sounding worried I just looked at him in disgust \"My brother may have had his ass kicked yesterday but that will be nothing compared to what I will do to you if I ever go near him again\" I felt someone trying to pull me away from Freddie who was now shouting from the grip I had on him \"Got it?\" I asked him dangerously, he just nodded quickly and I dropped him from my grip and walked away. The incident had travelled fast around the school and people were either talking to me, avoiding me or looking at me like I was crazy. I looked down at the schedule the lovely receptionist had given me and noticed it was time for sports. I changed into the sports uniform they had sent it was a green t shirt, grey shorts and a hoodie if I needed it but today I was just wearing the t shirt,shorts with some knee length socks and black trainers. I ran over to wear Daniel was kicking a ball around \"Hey\" I said he just nodded at me and passed me the ball, which we were kicking between us slowly we said nothing for ages until he looked up at me \"I heard what you did\" I wasn't shocked its what most people have been talking about all day \"Thanks\" now that is what shocked me, usually he hates when I do stuff like that. I shrugged my shoulders at him \"You're my brother, I know we don't get along most of the time but you are still my twin\" We stayed in comfortable silence until Ali bounced up to us and grimaced looking at Daniel's eye \"Hi\" she looked at me uncomfortable obviously not wanting to be around me, I sighed and walked off a little. I heard someone walking behind me and the Cobra Kai's \"Hey\" I just nodded and smiled a little wondering why they were talking to me \"I'm Johnny, this is Bobby, Tommy, Dutch and Jimmy\" \"Kat\" I said snorting at Dutch's name \"Your parents named you Dutch\" he looked angry that I asked \"Your parents named you Kat?\" he said sarcastically and I laughed \"No they apparently my dad wanted to name me Satan's Spawn but my mother thought Katherine sounded nicer\" I told Dutch laughing and heard the rest of the Cobra Kai laugh whist Dutch just gave me a look of respect. \"So you're the ones who beat up my brother at the beach\" Johnny looked shocked, \"Wait he's your brother\" I nodded in a yes motion \"Well twin brother to be more specific\" they all looked shocked we're siblings \"If you're twins why were you fighting and told me to kick his ass?\"Johnny asked confused, I looked over to see Daniel looking at me and the same time as trying to talk to Ali \"we may be twins but we've never got on, I wouldn't say we hated each other but we're getting there\" I could see Johnny looking over to Ali in anger. \"So what did she do to make you so angry you tried to cave my brothers skull in for\" I asked kicking the ball around, Johnny looked at me \"It doesn't matter now\" he told me and kicked the ball from my feet \"Hey!\" I shouted chasing him and the rest of the Cobra Kai's, we played around and talked for a bit and I found out they're actually not that bad. I heard a whistle go \"Soccer Try outs!\" I heard coach Carlson shout out as Coach Ellington called for the football try outs, I turned to the boys \"Good Luck!\" Johnny smiled at me as he jogged backwards I giggled at him but stopped when I could see Daniel glaring at me from next to coach Carlson. whoops .[Chapter 3] Watching Daniel run over to the soccer try outs I couldn't help but feel like something bad was going to happen especially since Bobby and Tommy we're trying out for the team also. I turned to look at Johnny who looked at me and winked shoving down the urge to smile I looked back to my brother who was dribbling with the ball. I watched as Daniel successfully got passed two tackles before Bobby slid and tackled Daniel roughly \"Ouch!\" I looked to behind me to see Ali watching Daniel too I looked back just in time to see Daniel straddling Bobby and throwing punches \"Shit\" Running towards him I saw people holding back bobby as he tried to get to Daniel, the coach stood in front of them \"None of that on this team!\" Daniel looked shocked \"He hooked me!\" Pulling Daniel away from them, the coach pointed in the opposite direction \"I said out of here!\" \"Come on\" I told him pushing him away from the soccer field, as we passed the football try outs Daniel ripped his arm away from me \"Why don't; you go back to them since you're all best friends now\" I looked at him angrily as he pushed me \"Don't touch me loser\" pushing him to the ground he got up and grabbed me I heard people shouting at us from behind \"God you're a bitch!\" Tackling Daniel to the ground I pulled my arm back and swung it hitting him perfectly in the side of the face \"Larusso!\" neither of us stopped as all the students ran up to us \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" I screamed as I felt someone lift me off of Daniel \"You're dead!\" I shouted to him as Coach Carlson pushed Daniel away from me \"This school sucks man! It sucks\" I turned to see Johnny holding me and the Cobra Kai's laughing next to me \"You're ok kid\" Dutch said as he ruffled my hair. \"Are you ok?\" I looked at Johnny who was looking at me in concern. I nodded \"yeah this isn't our first fight and definitely not our last\" the boys all chuckled around me and each patted me on the back \"Well as long as you're good\" I nodded at Johnny when they all started to walk away \"Oh and don't forget to ice those knuckles killer\" I raised my eye brow \"Killer?\" Johnny nodded as he jogged backwards and shouted \"that was a killer right hook!\" Smiling to myself I walked away only to be stopped by Ali \"That was a real shitty thing to do\" looking at her in disgust I pushed past her \"He started it…he always does\" Slamming my locker shut I turned to see the Cobra Kai's waving me over \"What's up boys?\" Johnny smiled at me from his bike \"Wanna hang out?\" the other boys smiled at me waiting for my answer I frowned \"Sorry but Principal Louis called my mom about mine and the idiots fight\" I nodded in the direction of Daniel getting into my moms car \"Rain check?\" I told them walking off \"Most definitely\" I heard Johnny mummer to himself. \"What are you smirking for young lady this is no smirking matter\" mom shouted out of the car window \"Chill mom it's no biggie\" I told her as she pulled into the street \"no biggie? Have you seen your brothers face?\" catching my brothers eyes in the mirror I glared knowing he already played himself the victim \"You're dead\" I mouthed and snickered seeing his eyes widen \"Katherine!\" Getting through the door I threw my bag on the floor and jumped on the couch \"Are you even listening to me Katherine\" I nodded and tried not to get angry at my brother who was pulling faces at me from behind our ma's back. \"It's not all my fault ma I tried to help him after her punched Bobby Brown in the face but then he pushed me!\" Daniel's eyes widen as our ma turned to look at him \"Daniel\" Daniel started to stutter \"uh well\" Ma huffed \"Is that true Daniel\" he nodded slowly \"Yeah ma but see Bobby started it and then Coach was unfair\" Ma threw her arms up in the air \"I can't believe you two, fighting on your first day now Katherine I believe but you I thought you knew better\" Ma turned back to me with fire in her eyes \"but that is no excuse to hit your brother Katherine\" I jumped up furious \"So it's ok that he called me a bitch why does he always get to be the favourite and I'm always the trouble\" Ma put up her hand \"I don't want to here it, I've got a big meeting to go to and I want you two to spend the rest of the afternoon out here doing something together. Maybe you'll bond again\" Ma walked to the door \"No more fighting\" I walked into my bedroom and slammed the door to get changed hoping to spare sometime before having to hang out with Daniel. An hour after being ferociously chewed out by our ma we were both in the living room spending time together to 'bond' again, So now I'm spending my afternoon watching my twin brother practice karate from a book. \"You know that'll never work right?\" Daniel stopped kick to give me a dirty look I put my hands up in surrender \"Just saying\" A knock at the door broke us out of sibling fight we both looked to see the handy man at the door. \"Come in\" I called to him as Daniel carried on kicking \"Fix faucet\" I pointed him to the kitchen \"It's the kitchen one\" The handy man bent down getting to work but kept his head above the counter watching Daniel \"Karate?\" he asked in a knowing voice. \"Yeah\" Daniel looked at me awkwardly probably wondering why the handy man was talking to him \"Very good\" I laughed as Daniel looked at me again \"Learn from book?\" Daniel glanced at the book in front of him \"And a few months at the Y in Newark\" Back in Newark our ma put us in classes to help keep ourselves safe if we were ever in a fight we both took Karate but my mom put me in beginners boxing so I could work out my anger issues probably explains why my 'killer' hook is so good. \"What happened to eye and face?\" Daniel sighed before kicking harder \"I fell off my bike\" I looked at him confused why he would cover for me and the cobras to someone we didn't know \"Lucky no hurt hand\" I laughed to myself but stopped when I saw him looking at my bruised knuckles accusingly. Pulling down the sleeve to my hoodie I avoided his gaze only to meet Daniels amused one \"Whatever...\" So how do you all like this chapter? I'm trying to change up my writing style so it's easier to read. Let me know what you think or message me if you have any questions or just wanna chat :) I'm always here x[Chapter 4] Walking into the cafeteria I picked up a tray adding sandwiches, fruit and juice, the day was half gone and I was successfully keeping myself out of trouble \"Ali with an I. How are you doing?\" I turned to see my brother talking to miss I-think-I'm-better-than-you \"Good\" pushing past them to pay I could hear Ali asking about me and my 'problem' rolling my eyes I walked outside. \"Kat!\" I turned to see the Cobra Kai gang and some girls sitting around a table \"Come sit with us\" I looked around to see everyone looking at me before walking over to the table \"Hey\" I said putting down my tray next to Johnny's \"You look great Kat\" I smiled in return before popping a grape in my mouth \"This is Barbara and Susan\" Tommy said with his arm around Barbara. \"How's the hand killer?\" the boys laughed as I picked up my hand to show them my bruised hand \"Ow looks like it hurts\" Barbara said pointing to my hand \"Nah I'm used to it\" flexing my finger I scowled as the joints popped painfully \"What do you mean?\" Johnny asked looking at me worried \"I used to do boxing in Newark\" Dutch laughed and leant forward \"I knew it! That punch was just too perfect\" I laughed along with them as we talked about my boxing and karate experience when Daniel and Ali walked out of the cafeteria laughed with each other \"Ali!\" Susan shouted waving over the blonde but Ali shook her head choosing to sit with Daniel instead \"Urgh I can't believe her\" \"So did you get in a lot of trouble?\" Johnny asked pointing to my hand when I looked at him confused \"Oh yeah big time Daniel played the victim card plus he's the golden child\" I told them rolling my eyes \"But don't worry Karma's a bitch but then so am I\" I told them all smirking as they laughed. Johnny stood picking up his pie \"Karma huh?\" I looked at him confused as he walked away. My eyes widen in shock when he quickly placed the pie on Daniel's seat just as Daniel was about to sit down. I laughed at the look on Daniel's face as he sat down on the pie, standing up quickly he turned to see the blueberry pie on his chair, the whole cafeteria erupted into laughter \"Eww gross\" A girl said passing him Daniel's face turned bright red in embarrassment. \"That was great\" I heard Johnny say in between laughs as Daniel glared at him, his white pants now had a huge blue stain on them and Ali didn't look too happy either \"You jerk\" she screamed at him and glaring over to our table as we laughed. Daniel wiped the glob of blueberries off his pants and held it in his hands looking at Johnny angrily \"Don't even think about it worm\" Johnny told him seriously before having the glob of blueberries thrown and him and wiped in his shirt. Mayhem soon erupted as Johnny dived at Daniel and all the Cobra Kai's jumped in to back Johnny up as other students tried to break up the two blueberry covered boys. Suddenly Coach Carlson walked out of the cafeteria and saw the fight \"Break it up you two\" he said pushing between the boys. Tuning to Daniel he growled \"This is the second time I've caught you attacking someone\" he caught my eye \"Actually it's three\" Daniel glared over at me as I shrugged my shoulders. \"Now you go to the principals office\" He said pointing to Daniel and then turned to Johnny \"And you go clean yourself up\" Johnny and Daniel stood glaring at each other \"I said now!\" Coach shouted just as the bell rang causing all the students to run in all directions \"Haven't you got somewhere to be Larusso?\" Coach called to me as I laughed walking to class. The bell rang and everyone cheered, putting my books in my bag I started walking to the school bus. I could see the Cobra Kai's sitting on their bike's talking so I hid behind a wall \"I don't know what it is man she's getting to me, no girl has made me feel this way\" Dutch made a fake girl ' oooh' sound before pushing Johnny's arm I smiled they were all obviously more like brothers than friends \"Just don't screw it up\" Bobby said. Walking towards the bus I hear a whistle \"Hey Kat!\" I turn to see Johnny waving at me \"What's up\" I looked at the guys who were all smirking to each other \"You know what we gotta go\" Bobby said bumping fists with Johnny \"See you at practice\" Johnny nodded at them. \"So Kat wanna ride home?\" I looked at him shocked this was the approach he was going to take \"Yeah...\" I looked up to see Ali getting into her dad's Rolls-Royce then it hit me how different we all really were I bet Johnny lives in a mansion or something and I live in a dingy apartment where the pool water is green and the handy man is kinda creepy \"You know what I think I'm gonna take the bus\" I told him walking off towards the yellow school bus. \"Hey wait!\" I heard footsteps behind me before his hand grabbed my arm \"What's wrong?\" I sighed and turned to see his confused beautiful face shaking my head \"Nothing it's just...nothing\" Johnny rubbed his hand up and down my arm \"what are you so afraid of?\" my head shot up as I glared at his perfect smirking face. \"I'm not afraid of anything\" my chin jutting out in defiance \"So lets go\" he told me nodding his head in the direction of his bike \"Hey girly are you getting on or not?\" I looked up to the overweight sweating bus driver through the open door of the bus \"No she's with me\" Johnny told him pulling me towards his new Honda \"Get on\" he told me sitting on his bike. I stood staring at his bike unsure as he looked back at me \"What you afraid?\" he taunted smirking knowing he had me. Frowning I took his hand and climbed on the back pulling the straps on my backpack tighter \"You might wanna hold on\" he told me before riding off. Throwing my arms around his waist I glared at the back of his helmet \"you did that on purpose\" I heard him laughing. Showing him the way to go my heart started to beat faster as we got closer to the apartment. \"Here\" I pointed as he pulled up in front of the complex holding Johnny's shoulder I jumped off the bike \"This is where you live?\" I looked behind me in distain \"Until I'm 18\" I laughed awkwardly as Johnny looked at the complex \"It's definitely not the hills but…\" Johnny looked at me shocked before Daniel rode up on his push bike and started at me and Johnny. \"Kat! Can I talk to you\" I smiled awkwardly at Johnny and walked over to Daniel \"What!\" I growled at him when he pulled me away from where Johnny could hear us \"What the hell! Now he knows where I live\" I looked at Daniel annoyed \"Not everything is about you!\" Daniel pointed to his face which was still littered with bruises. \"I'm the one who got his ass kicked by your new boyfriend!\" I growled at Daniel and got closer to him \"And whose fault is that?\" he looked shocked at me \"This place sucks man\" I laughed softly \"Yeah it does\" we both looked up at each other shocked \"You're a loser\" I told him \"Yeah and you're a bitch\" we both looked at each other for a second before walking away awkwardly. \"Sorry about that he's an idiot\" Johnny laughed even his laugh is perfect damn it \"well you better go\" he nodded starting his bike \"by the way the hills mean nothing to me\" he said putting on his helmet and speeding away leaving me blushing and my mouth open in shock. Hope this chapter was okay, I've got a new laptop now one that actually works so I can put a lot more time into my fanfictions now hopefully. Thanks for reading, favouriting and following! Also thanks to those who have been messaging me you're all so sweet :D[Chapter 5] Walking to the apartment \"Damn Californians with their blonde hair and hot bodies\" Shutting the door I jumped up seeing Ma and Daniel in the sitting room. \"Who has a hot body?\" Ma asked putting away some clothes I looked at Daniel who was snickering \"Uh me it was a hot day today\" Ma walked up to me and put her hand on my head \"You're not coming down with something are you?\". I shook my head laughing \"I'm fine\" Ma's look of concern turned into a frown as she turned to Daniel \"Now Daniel seeing as I got a call from your principals office again today Katherine is driving\" I looked shocked as I caught the car keys. \"Really?\" I asked in disbelief as Ma nodded and winked at me \"Good job kiddo\" I squealed \"Wait where are we going?\" I asked confused as Ma laughed \"We're going to the restaurant\" I nodded before opening my bedroom door \"let me change I smell of school\" Hearing Ma laugh I quickly changed, retouched my make up and took my hair out of it's plait so it was curly. \"I'm done let's go\" All but running down to the car I quickly opened the door and got behind the wheel as Daniel strapped his bike to the roof of the car. \"Wow Kat you've be quiet for more than 3 minutes you feeling ok?\" Daniel asked me sarcastically \"Daniel leave your sister alone, jeez it's like you've switched bodies\" Ma said looking between the two of us. \"Ok then Katherine let's go\" nodding I put the car into drive and eased on the pedal pulling out of the car park and on the way to the orient express, it was only a short drive but I was driving none the less. \"In here\" Ma called to me suddenly I quickly turned the car wheel narrowly missing the turning \"Thanks for the directions Ma\" I told her sarcastically as I parked outside the restaurants \"So how do you think I did?\" I asked her nervously as she smiled at me \"You did great princess\" Ma looked at me shocked \"I haven't called you that in a while\" Smiling to myself I opened the car door and got out, taking of my hoodie I threw it back in the car for later and shut the door and giving the keys back to Ma. I saw Daniel looking at the dojo next door the restaurant \"wanna check it out?\" I asked him, Daniel looked shocked for a minute before nodding. \"We'll just be a sec Ma\" Daniel to our mom pointing in the direction of the dojo \"okay. Not too long or we can't eat together\" We both nodded as we crossed the road narrowly missing a couple of cars. Walking through the door a lot of shouting could be heard, I looked at some of the pictures on the walls it was old war pictures. Looking in the corner of my eye I could see the students mostly had black belts here \"Wow this guy is like GI Joe\" I snickered to Daniel pointing to the picture with ' Sensei Kreese' written under it. I walked over to the chairs with Daniel who sat down quietly whist I leant against the wall listening carefully \"Fear does not exist in this dojo . Does it?\" I looked at Daniel who was awe struck \"No, Sensei!\" This was shouted 5 more times before Kreese stood quietly looking at me and Daniel before looking back to the students \"Prepare. Hei\" All of the students jumped to their feet. \"What do we study here?\" Sensei Kreese asked walking around again \"The way of the fist, sir!\" I noticed all students were standing tall with their hands behind their backs \"and what is that way?\" he was treating these students like soldiers \"Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!\" \"Right 2 minute respite and then attack training. Mr. Lawrence!\" I looked over in shock seeing Johnny and the rest of the gang standing in the middle of the dojo. \"Yes, Sensei \" Kreese looked at Johnny sternly \"When we regroup maybe you could concentrate more on work at hand and less on the pretty brunette at the door\" I blushed seeing all eyes turn to me and I looked over to see Daniel pushing past me obviously shocked to see Johnny here \"Daniel wait!\" I turned back to see the boys all walking towards me. \"Hey what are you doing here?\" Bobby asked when he reached me first \"Oh nothing just checking out the place\" I told him nonchalantly \"With Danielle?\" Dutch asked me laughing I smirked so they had saw him \"Yeah I guess\" looking at the boys smirking faces \"Although he's probably changed his mind seeing you here\" I told them laughing a little. \"Well I gotta go my mom and Daniel are probably waiting for me\" I told them putting my hands in my back pockets and walking away \"Hey Kat!\" I turned to see Johnny looking at back at me \"Wanna go out sometime?\" I laughed seeing all the boys looking at me expectantly \"Sure. Call me\" I told him casually as I walked away feeling like I want to squeal like a girl god get it together Katherine he's just a guy I thought to myself as I walked into the restaurant a great looking guy who probably has a 6 pack I smiled to myself. \"What are you looking so happy for?\" Ma asked me smiling I sat down in the booth \"Nothing\" I told her with the smile still plastered on my face picking at the food Ma must have ordered \"Oh come on it's more than nothing I haven't seen you smile like that in a long time\" I sighed and smiled \"Ok so this guy from school just asked me on a date\" Ma clapped her hands together \"Ahh! See I told you things were looking up. So do you like him?\" I nodded and looked at Daniel who was poking his food looking angry \"Yeah he's great\" Ma smiled and stroked my hair \"That's great baby\" she turned to Daniel \"And what about you? Any girl situations?\" Daniel shrugged \"It's okay\" Ma looked confused and tried to bait him \"Just okay? To me it looks like the whole world turned blonde\" Ma looked at me \"Has this guy you like blonde\" I nodded with a mouth full of food as Ma laughed. \"So you got your eye on anybody?\" Daniel nodded still quiet \"yeah he met her at the beach party he really fell for her\" I told her snickering as Daniel glared at me but Ma didn't seem to notice \"Cute? Not cute?\" Daniel shook his head smiling as I rolled my eyes she's beyond cute\". \"But she's blonde, right?\" Daniel smiled seeming more happy than before \"She's got blonde hair\" Ma laughed looking between us \"You twins and liking people with blondes\" I smiled at her as we ate \"So what's with the karate place?\" Ma asked pointing at the Dojo \"It sucks\" Daniel's said as I said it was great, we glared at each other heatedly. \"Good. We couldn't afford it anyway\" a lady walked up to our table calling for ma \"Lucille, let's go, here they come\" Ma got up but still fussed over us \"I'll see you guys later. I love you\" she kissed our heads \"Careful how you ride home and please stay with each other\" We both smiled at she walked away. \"You know that was a shitty thing to do?\" I looked up at Daniel confused \"Um what?\" I asked him confused as he glared at me \"You know what I'm talking about Katherine\" I sighed tiredly \"Ok what did I do now?\" I asked pushing my plate away from me. \"Asking me if I wanted to go see the dojo knowing that they were going to be there\" he growled at me. \"One I was trying to be nice and two I didn't know that was their dojo\" Daniel laughed mockingly \"Nice? You don't know the meaning of nice\" people in the restaurant we now starting to look at us. \"You know what? I'm done I was trying not to fight with you for once but now I don't care. As far as I care we're no longer related\" I sneered at him reaching my boiling point. Getting out of the booth I started the walk home leaving a shocked Daniel behind. Walking the back way home I had finally cooled down enough that I realized it was probably stupid for me to walk home alone especially since it was getting dark. Stopping I thought I heard a scream, shrugging I carried on walking until I heard revving turning I saw a group of bikes heading towards me I smiled seeing the guys looking at me in concern. \"Kat?\" bobby asked as I walked around the bikes to see them \"hey guys\" I smiled \"What are you doing here?\" Dutch asked seeming a bit annoyed \"I'm walking home\" I told him confused \"He means why are you on your own\" Johnny asked roughly also looking angry. I sighed crossing my arms \"Well my mom works non stop and my brother doesn't seem to like the people I'm making friends with and he's an asshole\" I told them seeing all their face's darken \"Well you don't need to worry about him\" Tommy laughed as Johnny and bobby hit him. I looked at them all confused \"What?\" Johnny shook his head \"it's nothing. We were about to go to golf n stuff wanna come?\" he asked nicely \"Yeah come on Kat it'll be cool\" Jimmy said almost bouncing with excitement. Smiling I nodded \"Sure what the hell\" the boys all whooped excitedly as I jumped on the back of Johnny's bike \"Thanks\" I whispered in his ear knowing he knew I was upset I felt his hand squeeze the one I had wrapped around his waist. \"Race Ya!\" I called tapping Johnny on the shoulder and laughing as the others rushed to start their bikes. I smiled hearing Johnny laughed and felt his back vibrate things definitely are looking up.[Chapter 6] After beating the boys and most of the games in arcade I had successfully forgotten all about everything and I was actually happy. \"Come on guys let's ride on the go karts\" Tommy shouted energetically. I walked over to the shooting game \"You coming Kat?\" Bobby asked kindly, I smiled at him he was one of the guys I could genuinely be friends with \"No thanks\" I shook my head and picked up the rifle which was connected to the machine and shot. \"Damn\" I whispered as I missed the target jumping I felt a hand on my arm and another around my waist \"You're doing it wrong\" Johnny's voice whispered in my ear gently. I coughed feeling him close to me \"I'm never wrong\" I told him without conviction I really couldn't think straight with him pressed up against me. Johnny laughed and I shivered feeling his breath in my ear \"That defensiveness will be the end of you\" frowning I knew he meant it as a joke but he didn't realize how true that probably was, sarcasm and being defensive had gotten me through a lot of tough times but it was also my downfall. \"Now aim more this way\" Johnny pull our arms over to the right a little but I was too busy concentrating on not thinking about the way our bodies were fitting together and how close we really were. Johnny's finger curled around mine and we shot the little bird target out of the sky. \"See you just needed a little help\" oh how very true but I had survived this far by being closed off but could I really do that for much longer. Johnny took the rifle and put it back in the holder as I turned and found myself trapped between his arms which were now either side of me. Looking into Johnny's eyes I smiled \"Thanks\" I whispered putting my hands on his chest making him smile \"For what?\" he asked looking confused \"For making me feel normal\" Johnny smiled widely before pulling me towards him and kissing me deeply as I put my arms around his neck. Pulling back, I smiled until I saw the time \"Shit!\" Johnny jumped as I swore \"Was that bad?\" he asked looking very shocked \"What? No…No the kiss was great\" seeing Johnny smirk confidently I pushed him a little \"I'm late home my ma is going to kill me\" I told him getting very worried. \"Come on\" he said pulling my arm he took us to his bike \"What about the guys?\" I asked as Johnny got on the bike \"They won't even realize I'm gone\" he said as he held his hand out for me and helped me on to the bike. Let's just hope Ma hasn't noticed I'm not home... Pulling up to the front of the complex I got off the bike and thanked Johnny who put his arm around my waist and pulled me into another mind blowing kiss. Walking off I smiled tracing my lips \"Kat?\" turning I saw Johnny still sitting on his bike \"Yeah?\" I asked confused. \"Be my girl?\" he asked quietly almost shyly \"I know it's quick but you're just so...great\" smiling I realized no one had ever made me feel as happy as he had managed to make me feel in just 1 hour. Nodding I kissed him again \"always\" walking away I smiled again I was the girlfriend of Johnny Lawrence Squealing like a girl I bounced up the stairs nothing could make me lose this smile I thought until I walked into the apartment where my Ma was crying and Daniel looked beat up \"what happened?\" I asked quietly as the tension in the apartment was high. \"what happened is your brother was attacked on the way home, where were you? You were supposed to be together\" Ma screamed at me as she paced in the living room, Daniel just looked at me angrily as If this was my fault. \"Ma he was the one who shouted at me and called me names in the restaurant!\" I shouted back hoping that she would see that It wasn't just my fault \"He's the one who always starts it and I look like the bad guy\" \"That's because you are the bad guy Katherine, if you hadn't walked away from him he would be ok!\" she screamed again making me angry \"Oh yeah I forgot he's the golden child he can't do a thing wrong did you ever think that he did something first that made someone attack him?\" Ma looked up at me as If I had slapped her \"You are just like your father do you know that\" I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach, pushing past Ma I shut my door and locked it. Throwing some clothes, my sketch pad, all the money and a bit of make up in my backpack I cried hearing my Ma banging on the door \"Katherine you get out here now!\" Slamming the door open I walked out with my bag \"Don't worry I am out of here\" I screamed watching as my mother's face paled \"Katherine where are you going? Kat!\" running down the stairs I pushed past the maintenance guy who just watched me go with a confused face. Looking out of the window of the bus I had caught the rain pelted against the windows It was just the right weather to go with how I was feeling right now. Broken. The only thing I wanted to do right now self-destruct. \"Hey kid\" my head shot up to see the driver waving at me \"Last stop\" he said pointing to the doors grabbing my bag I got off the bus wishing I'd been a bit more level headed back at the apartment so I remembered to grab my coat. Looking around I realized I had no idea where I was or where I was going until a man walked up to me smiling \"Hey I'm Kyle\" nodding I looked at Kyle he was the typical blonde Californian jock he looked like he was around 22 \"Kat\" I told him wondering what he wanted. \"Hey Kyle!\" Kyle turned to see some other jocks his age and it made me laugh it made me think of what the Cobra Kai are going to look like in college \"Guys this my new friend Alley Kat\" I looked up at Kyle who was now as drenched as I was from the rain \"You know but your drenched like an alley Kat\" he laughed. \"Come on let's go over here\" Letting Kyle pull me along I wondered what he wanted and why he was being so friendly \"You look down Alley Kat\" one of the guys said to me he reminded me of bobby he had caring eyes \"I just had a fight with my mom and brother\" I told them honestly. \"Here this will help\" I was soon passed a bottle of vodka, looking into the bottle I wondered if this was such a good idea but still I put the bottle to my lips and drank until I couldn't breathe making the guys whistle and whoop \"I knew you'd be fun Alley Kat\" After half an hour of more drinking I was definitely more than tipsy \"Come on let's dance in the rain\" I shouted and we all ran in the rain and jumped around like idiots before I heard a very familiar voice behind me \"Kat?\"[Chapter 7] Turning around unbalanced I giggled waving my arms in the air wildly \"Bobby!\" jumping forward I grabbed Bobby's hand and pulled him over to the guys taking no notice of the look he was giving me\"This is my best friend Bobby\" I announced to everyone as Bobby looked at me in surprise \"Are you drunk Kat?\". Pinching my fingers together I giggled again not caring about how stupid I looked right now \"Mayyyybe a little\" Bobby looked between me and the guys wearily before putting his hand on my arm carefully \"Come on Kat, you're coming with me\" Bobby said trying to convince me to leave with him. \"Hey!\" I shouted pulling my arm back dropping the whiskey bottle I held in my hand causing it to shatter \"Kat let's go\" Bobby begged as Kyle walked over and pulled me closer to him, the atmosphere between all of us changing \"I don't think she wants to go with you\" Bobby looked over a Kyle angrily before looking back at me he's eyes now pleading \"Please Kat\" he whispered softly before Kyle pushed him away from me \"Back off man!\" Kyle shouted as Bobby looked ready to defend himself. Turning to Kyle I pushed him back away from Bobby and I angrily \"Don't talk to him like that asshole\" picking up my backpack I walked to Bobby who threw his arm over my shoulder protectively before I was grabbed back roughly \"You're not going anywhere\" Kyle shouted in my face, pulling back my fist I swung it forward punching Kyle in the nose making him fall to his knees. \"Ouch!\" I shouted holding my hand to my chest as Bobby pulled me to where his bike was parked, still holding my hand I watched as Bobby jumped on the bike and motioned me to get on in front of me \"I'm supposed to go on the back\" I told him laughing as the rain continued to pour on us. Bobby smiled softly before helping me onto the bike \"Yes but that's when I can trust you to hold on\" he told me jokingly before speeding off with me sobering up every second of the way, realizing I would have to tell him what happened. Pulling up to some houses Bobby got off the bike and I turned so I was sitting sideways \"What were you doing with them Kat?\" I sniffed as I remembered my night, rubbing my face I sighed \"I left home\" I told Bobby as he looked at me confused and concerned. \"Someone hurt Daniel bad on the way home after we had an argument and he told our mom that I wasn't there and she blew up on me\" I told Bobby with fresh tears rolling down my face as Bobby looked at me guiltily \"She just kept screaming at me and saying such horrible things\" I said feeling the pain all over again as Bobby wrapped his arms around me. Laying my head on Bobby's shoulder I sighed \"Am I that horrible?\" Bobby looked at me shocked before shaking his head profusely \"No you're great\" I laughed and pulled myself away, he was probably the only one who thought that\"Plus you can trust me we're best friends remember\" he told me mockingly with a smile. Hearing a door open I looked up to see Dutch at the door \"Bobby!\" he shouted sounding happy before seeing me \"Kat?\" the door opened wider this time before the rest of the Cobra Kai saw us and began to walk to us. \"Are you having a party\" I asked as I heard music from the open door, Bobby half nodded as the rest of the Cobra Kai met us at the bike \"Kat? What are you doing here?\" Johnny asked me whilst I hugged myself to him. \"And why do you smell like vodka?\" gasping I looked up at him happily \"Vodka! Do you have any?\" Johnny smiled at me like I had just said the cutest thing before nodding and looking at Bobby \"What happened man?\" Bobby looked at me sadly before shaking his head. \"I'm homeless\" I giddily said to Johnny before telling him about Daniel and the fight he, me and our Ma got into \"And then I left\" I told them as they all look pissed off, Johnny pulled me towards him and I tried to not let any tears fall again \"And my hand hurts\" I whimpered as Bobby laughed behind me \"Definitely a killer right hook\" he said laughing telling the boys about Kyle. \"What am I going to do with you\" Johnny asked jokingly, smiling I looked up at him \"Vodka?\" the boys laughed and pulled me into Johnny's house \"Bobby call around let's give Kat a real party\" Dutch whooped as he and the other guys went on an alcohol and snack run leaving just me and Johnny. Wrapping my arms around my wet clothes I could feel his gaze on me \"I'm sorry\" looking up at him I frowned \"You didn't do anything wrong\" Johnny opened his mouth before shutting it \"I need to get changed\" I told him with a small smile. Grabbing my hand Johnny led me upstairs and opened a door to what I'm guessing is his room \"Throw your clothes in there\" he said nodding to a basket in the corner before closing the door, I nodded and walked into Johnny's room. Quickly using Johnny's shower I washed away any signs of the night I had and made myself into Kat again, the tough bitch who lives without a care, changing into my spare clothes I dried my hair and put on some makeup I had brought with me. Sighing I put it all back in my bag and looked at my reflection frowning was I really like my dad? A good for nothing bully and loser. \"Kat?\" I opened the door to a concerned looking Johnny who had also changed \"Hey\" I said smiling at him noticing how great he looked and smelled. Wrapping my arms around his neck I leaned my head on his neck and smelled \"Thanks for all of this\" I told him sincerely, pulling back a little Johnny moved my hair out my face before leaning down to kiss me. Pulling him closer to me I deepened this kiss as Johnny picked me up and sat me on the counter, his hands on my thighs, Music started to play from downstairs and cheerful voices could be heard coming into the house. Breaking the kiss I leaned my head against Johnny's smiling \"Well now I feel a lot better\" Johnny smiled widely at me before helping me off the counter and walking out of his room hand in hand, looking over the railing and down into Johnny's 'mansion' house I gasped at the sight of all the people. \"Ready for this?\" Johnny asked putting his head on my shoulders before kissing my neck, nodding I squealed when Johnny threw me over his shoulder carrying down the stairs \"Kat!\" a lot of people I noticed from school screamed holding up there beers to me in greeting. I waved as johnny place me down my a laughing Bobby \"So madam what can I get you\" Johnny asked bowing to me smiling I raised an eyebrow \"Surprise me\" the boys all stopped silent in what looked like shock. Dutch threw an arm over my shoulder \"I knew I liked you\" laughing I picked up the cup Johnny placed in front of me \"Here you go killer\" picking up the cup I drank some before grinning \"It's great\" looking to where every one was dancing I noticed Barbara and Susan waving me over. Drinking the rest of the cup I jumped from the counter and kissed Johnny before running off to dance with the girls forgetting all about Daniel and my mom. Watching as his girlfriend danced happily with her friends Johnny smiled drinking some of his beer \"So what do we do about him?\" Dutch asked darkly as he looked over at Kat \"Who?\" Johnny said looking at his very angry friend\"Danielle\" he muttered looking at Johnny. \"She was really upset man\" Bobby told Johnny as he too drank his beer. \"Rough having your only family desert you like that\" Jimmy said making the others nod in agreement, Johnny felt the anger course through him tightening his jaw he growled \"then he needs to be taught a lesson\" Tommy let out a shrill laugh as the 5 hit their cups together in a cheers motion before joining the party. A/N: okay so I know this chapter was really bad but I've had a mental block with this story, sorry :( Thank you to everyone reading this story it means a lot to me. Q: Is there anything you would like to see happen or Kat do? or is there something you would like to see another character do or say?[Chapter 8] The party was long since over leaving just me and the Cobra Kai's left in Johnny's house, I smiled as I lay on the couch with Johnny as the other guys were strewn in different places \"So Kat what did you think?\" Bobby asked smiling widely at me with very drunk looking eyes which I'm sure we all shared. I smiled as I felt Johnny twirl a piece of my hair \"It was great thanks, guys\" I laughed as each Cobra Kai puffed up like a peacock obviously feeling very proud of themselves. \"I'm so tired and I have to finish my project tomorrow or today in a couple of hours\" I muttered rubbing a hand over my face. Dutch looked over at me with a smirk \"you're still going in?\" I nodded with a smile \" I don't have the luxury of failing\" I said throwing a pillow at Dutch making the boys laugh, Johnny stood and pulled me up with him \"Come on guys let's get this princess to sleep\". I looked at Johnny confused until he grabbed me in his arms making me squeal as he carried me up the stairs and dropping me onto the bed making me laugh \"Here\" Johnny said smiling at me as he handed me some shorts and a long shirt. Looking up at Johnny I couldn't help but smile \"What?\" he asked with a nervous smile making my smile even bigger I had never seen Johnny the way I was seeing him right now and it was honestly making me fall harder for him. Leaning up I wrapped my arms around his neck and pulled him into a kiss, the kiss was deepened by Johnny running his hands down me until he lay us down on his bed. Johnny pushed himself up and stared down at me \"What are you doing to me\". Hearing a knock at the door I smiled and kissed him one more time before pushing him away from me and grabbing his clothes, locking myself into his bathroom I changed into his shirt and his shorts which were a little too big. Sighing I took a deep breath and leaving the shorts off knowing they'd just fall down when I walked, Opening the door a little I peeked my head out and blushed seeing the boys lay around the room in various places and Johnny lay in the bed. \"You ok princess?\" Bobby asked and I blushed again not only because of the shorts but because they boys had nicknamed me Princess, I had never been a Princess to anyone. I looked at Johnny and he looked concerned \"The shorts are too big\" I muttered as Johnny smiled at me before pulling back the sheets on his bed and patting the spot next to him. Taking a deep breath I quickly walked from the bathroom and jumped into the bed as the boys whistled and laughed making me blush a deeper red then I had before. \"Woo look at those legs\" Dutch called making me squeal \"Stop it\". \"Tommy hit the light\" Johnny ordered and then it hit me that I was sharing a bed with Johnny, scooting away from him as I heard soft snores coming from the floor \"what's wrong?\" Johnny whispered to me with his hand on my waist. \"Nothing, this is just new to me\" I whispered back softly \"I'm not the one who makes friends that's Daniel and now this with you I just.., I don't know\" I muttered with a small sigh, I squealed when I felt myself being pulled towards Johnny. I lay my head on his chest as he rubbed circles on my back making me sigh contently \"Well you've got us now\" Johnny says making me sigh happily, I closed my eyes feeling the happiest I had been in a long time. Groaning I pulled myself closer to the heat I was feeling next to me until the heat next to me moved and put a heavy arm around me, opening my eyes I looked over to see Johnny staring back at me \"Morning\" I whispered as he put his hand on my face and gave me a soft kiss. Getting out of bed I grabbed my bag and tiptoed over all the still sleeping bodies, closing the bathroom door I locked it and took a shower. After getting dressed, doing my hair and makeup I opened the door and laughed seeing the boys still asleep except for Johnny who was dressed and smiling at me. \"What are you doing I thought you and the guys were staying here?\" I asked him throwing my bag onto my shoulder as Johnny grinned at me \"Well every Princess needs a carriage\" Johnny says with a handsome smirk. Smiling I walk past him laughing until he pulls me into him in the hall and presses me against the wall with a searing kiss putting my hands in his hair I pulled him closer. I pushed Johnny before running downstairs giggling only stopping when I saw a very buisnessy looking woman stood in the kitchen. Johnny ran up being me before stopping and seeing the woman \"Oh mom this is my girlfriend Kat\" The woman looked up from the book she was flipping through and smiled at me \"Kat this is my mom, Eleanor\" I was shocked to see Eleanor she was a very big fashion designer around right now and I was a big fan, I smiled until I looked down at the very familiar book the woman was looking through it was my design book. Gasping I felt my stomach drop as Eleanor looked up to me with a smile \"Are these your designs\" she asked very nicely but I could only nod slowly. Walking to Eleanor I took the book of her and gripped it tightly \"You weren't uh supposed to see those\" I stammered before running off to the front door quickly \"Kat wait\" I opened the door before turning back to see Johnny looking at me confused. \"What's wrong? Where you going?\" he asked me but I just shuffled out of the door \"Uh I'll see you later,\" I told him before running to the bus and sighing as I looked down at my dress designs sighing I closed my sketchbook and shoved it back into my bag. My designs were not anywhere near good and now the most popular fashion designer and more importantly my boyfriend's mother had just been looking at them she's probably back at her house laughing at them. Putting my head on the glass window of the bus I sighed deeply how was I so happy last night and now I feel like my life has hit a wall. Closing my eyes I breathed softly before I jumped realizing that today I would see Daniel in school and my mother is probably wondering where I ran off to. Great...[Chapter 9] Getting off the bus I pulled my bag onto my shoulder and crossed my arms feeling very self-conscious as I walked, passing Barbara and Susan I walked over to my locker and opened it grabbing some of my books \"Kat!\" they both called in unison as they stood either side of me. \"Hey,\" I said giving them a smile \"We didn't think you'd be here,\" Susan said giving me a smirk making me smile \"I don't really have a choice,\" I tell them as I close my locker and leaning against it \"Have you seen my brother around?\" I ask them noticing how their smiles drop and eyes roll. \"I've seen him around with Ali\" Barbara told me as Susan looked away in disgust \"She's like totally deserted us for him, no offense\" I just nodded with a chuckle \"None taken\" I tell them as Barbara links her arm with mine \"but now we have you\" I just look between her and Barbara with an awkward smile. I open my mouth but the sound of the bell cuts me off \"Uh yeah I gotta go to class\" I tell them as I turn and walk away to class \"Kat?\" I stopped and turned to see Johnny standing in the now deserted hall looking at me confused. \"Johnny...\" I start but I get cut off by Johnny walking up to me \"Did I do something wrong?\" he asks quietly as if it wasn't his thing to ask those type of questions. I shook my head and gripped my books tighter \"No it's just... It's nothing I'm sorry\" I tell him as he pulls me in close and kisses the side of my head. \"Come on let's get to class\" Johnny says as he puts his arm around my shoulder and leads me down the hall \"Katherine Larusso!\" a shrill voice screams as we pass the principals office, Johnny and I turn around to see my mom and Daniel at the door of the principal's office. \"Do you have any idea how worried I've been over you\" She screamed again looking like she was about to cry \"Mrs. Larusso please...\" Principal Louis said to my mom quietly noticing the students starting to come out of their classrooms noticing the noise. \"Worried? You practically kicked me out\" I told her as Johnny tightened his grip on me, Mom closed her eyes and sighed, \"Daniel told me what happened at the restaurant and he is getting punished for not telling me the truth,\" Ma said as if that solved everything. \"Well isn't he a hero\" I shouted throwing my arms up in anger as I looked over at Daniel and stepped forward angrily \"Golden boy again\" I mutter as Johnny pulls me back protectively \"Come on Kat\" Mom looks over to Johnny confused \"Who is he?\". I walked towards my mom and whispered \"He was one of the only people who had my back last night, so you should be thanking him\" I told her scathingly as I walked back to Johnny and grabbed his hand. \"Katherine please\" Mom begged as I turned and looked at her emotionless trying to not show everyone my heart was breaking, I was always second best in my Ma's eyes. \"Just be home tonight,\" she asked before her eyes met Johnny's \"Thank you\" Johnny nodded stoically as Daniel let out a snort of disbelief. I looked at my brother who had his arms crossed and his face all bruised up but wouldn't look me in the eyes, he knew how much trouble he had got me into and that anything could have happened to me on the streets and yet he would even apologize to me. \"Let's go please\" I whispered as Johnny glared at Daniel before looking back at me with his eyes softening \"Sure\" he muttered as he pulled me away from the two people who were supposed to care about me the most but were the ones causing me the most pain. Pretending I didn't see eyes on me as I walked away I looked up at Johnny \"Sorry for running out on you\" I told him truthfully, I didn't want to run from him but seeing his mother the fashion designer looking through my pipe dream I panicked. We stopped at Johnny's locker and I leaned against it as he put his bag inside and pulled out some books \"So my mom wants to meet you\" I choked on air when Johnny told me that \"Does it have anything to do with this morning?\" I asked worriedly I didn't want Eleanor to dislike me. \"I don't think so\" Johnny offered a shrug as he looked at me but still looked confused \"she doesn't usually want to meet my girlfriends \"Oh great I'm just lucky\" I tell him sarcastically as we walk away from the lockers together \"Don't sweat it, it'll be fine\" Johnny comforts as he puts his arm around me glaring at the other guys staring at us. I stopped next to my sewing class where the room was practically empty, only girls who were behind or had big projects had this class \"So are you going to show me?\" Johnny questions as he leans over me \"Huh?\" I ask as I find myself losing my train of thought when he was this close to me. Johnny smirked at me knowingly but nodded to the class behind me \"Uhh no... sorry\" I told him as he looked at me confused \"it's a.. surprise\" I added hoping he wouldn't get annoyed at my secretiveness \"Okay can't wait\" he smiled showing me his white teeth. \"I totally can't see what's so bad about you\" I laugh before remembering I shouldn't have told him that \"What do you mean?\" Johnny questions looking pissed \"Nothing it was just something Daniel said,\" I told him offhandedly. \"So then tell me\" Johnny half demanded but not in a mean way \"It's just that him, Ali and those guys we hung around with at the beach said some things about you but they were obviously wrong because I've seen how you and the guys are and you're definitely not assholes\". Johnny just nodded with a thoughtful look before smiling at me and pressing a kiss to my forehead \"I gotta go but meet me at lunch okay?\" Johnny called as he ran backward making me laugh at him, was it possible to like someone this quickly? Shaking my head I walked into the class and into a smaller room behind the teacher's desk, Mrs. Hanson had kindly let me use it when I told her what my project was, pulling off the clean sheet covering my project I brought out my drawing book and began to get to work.[Chapter 10] Hearing the bed ring signaling the end of the school day I sighed happily and closed my book as my classmates ran out of the room I threw my bag over my shoulder and calmly walked out of the room singing to myself. Feeling myself being thrown over someone's shoulder I screamed \"Bobby!\" Bobby laughed and kept walking as the other students watched us with interest \"Put me down idiot\" I shouted glad that I had worn tights under my dress today. I squeaked feeling another pair of hands pull me from Bobby's shoulder but this time I smiled when I noticed I was in Johnny's arms \"Hey\" I greeted as he placed me back down on the ground so I was stood between his legs as he sat sideways on his bike. \"Hey\" He mumbled back as he brushed his lips against mine \"HI\" Dutch called as he gave me a slobbery kiss on my cheek \"Eww, what the hell\" I laughed as I rubbed my cheek free from Dutch's kiss as he and the others laughed loudly. \"You're gross\" I pouted leaning back into Johnny as the guys started talking about their bikes and I sat with them contently even though I had no idea what they were talking about but just being there with them was good enough for me. Looking around I noticed Daniel walking with Ali and Susan walking out of school all laughing until Daniel's eyes met mine and widened, I frowned when Ali looked over to us and back to Daniel who was now trying to walk in the other direction. Something was up with Daniel and it looked like he and Ali were arguing over something, Daniel's eyes drifted over to us again before looking at Ali angrily \"Get off my case!\" he shouted at her before running off back into school. Ali turned back around looking disappointed and looked up noticing my watching eyes and she glared at me as Susan gave me a small wave looking equally confused \"Whatcha lookin at?\" Bobby asked as he looked over in the direction I was. \"Little miss perfect\" I muttered before standing up as the guys notice Ali's staring \"Where are you going?\" Dutch questioned as I begin to walk over to Ali's direction before being stopped by a hand on my arm \"Don't go over there\" Johnny whispers to me as I look up at him. \"why not? She obviously has a problem with me?\" I tell him as he runs a hand through his hair when Ali stomps over to us \"Are you happy now?\" she snaps looking in Johnny's direction \"Trouble in paradise?\" I taunted as her eyes met mine and a red hue came over her face. \"Why don't you ask your best friends\" Ali sneers before walking in the opposite direction and I turned to Johnny who just smiled at me \"What was she talking about?\" I question them all but they just shrug at me looking guilty. \"Guys?\" I said hoping there was nothing going on \"Maybe he's just still upset from the beach?\" Jimmy answered as I nodded unsure \"Yeah maybe?\" Johnny wound his arms around me again with a cheeky smile \"Not maybe, he's just being sensitive\" he told me and I laughed knowing how touchy Daniel could get. \"Plus look how he's treated you recently,\" Bobby said softly and I smiled at him \"Yeah!\" Tommy shouted agreeing with him \"He's an asshole!\" the guys laughed and nodded along with Tommy \"Forget about him, you have us\" Johnny reminded me as he started his bike. Taking him outstretched hand I climbed on the back of the bike \"See when you're not drunk you can be trusted to get on the back of the bike\" Bobby laughed as he gave me a wide smile \"Yeah very funny Brown\" I glared using his last name as the guys looked at us confused. \"Where are we going?\" Dutch asked as he started his bike too \"I should go home\" I mumbled biting my lip knowing none of them were going to like that idea \"WHAT!\" they all shouted in unison making me flinch \"I can't stay with you guys forever\". \"Why the fuck not?\" Tommy shouted looking offended as I sighed looking to Johnny but all I could see was the muscles in his jaw tightening \"You know I would stay but I need to sort this out, Daniel's been the golden child for long enough\" I told them and they all nodded gently. Following Johnny's lead the guys all started their bikes and rode behind us as I held on to Johnny's waist tight and laid my head on his back watching all the houses fly by, I was ready to tell my mother and brother exactly how I felt, being with Johnny made me realise I was sick of getting into trouble because of Daniel. I noticed we were getting into the poorer part of town where I lived and I suddenly remembered only Johnny knew where I lived and my stomach dropped hoping they wouldn't judge me just like Johnny didn't judge me when he saw the run down dingy apartments. Feeling Johnny's bike halt I looked up and felt him rubbing my hands that were still tight against his waist as we wait for the others to catch up \"If you don't want to be here come back to me\" Johnny told me as I got off the bike and let him pull me into his arms. \"I mean it, baby, I don't want you getting hurt again\" Johnny whispered as he pressed a kiss to my temple when the guys round the corner whooping and laughing out loud \"Then maybe you could teach me some moves\" I say with a grin knowing the double meaning I had just given him. Johnny looked at me surprised before giving me a laugh as he tightened his grip on me as the guys stop by us \"That's not a bad idea\" Johnny said thoughtfully as he nodded \"What do you think about teaching Kat some moves\". The guys all nodded \"YEAH!\" Tommy burst out excitedly as I laughed \"Alright I gotta go\" I told them giving Johnny a kiss and walking away \"Don't forget we're setting up for the Halloween party tomorrow!\" Bobby called from behind me and I just waved over my shoulder with a laugh, he worries like a mother hen. Talking about mother hen's my stomach tightens when I spot my Ma sat at the front door like she was waiting for something \"Ma?\" I call quietly as her head jumps up and he eyes begin to water \"Katherine\" she whispers out before pulling me into a hug \"I'm so sorry baby\". I tap her on the back comfortingly as I felt her tears hit my shoulder \"I shouldn't have said those things to you\" Ma cried as she held me tighter and I noticed Daniel watching us from his spot on the couch. Pushing Ma back gently I crossed my arms and walked into the apartment with her following me \"Don't you have something to say to your sister?\" Ma shouted at Daniel who rolled his eyes \"I'm sorry\" he mumbled looking the least sorry I'd ever seen him. I laughed spitefully \"No your not\" Daniel looked at me silently he knew I was right \"I'm sick of this Ma, I'm sick of coming second because of him\" I sobbed to my mom who looked like I'd taken her breath away. \"I probably broke your heart when I left here last night but you've been breaking mine for years, Daniel has been pushing me and pushing me for years so it's no wonder I finally gave in and stopped giving a shit!\" I screamed as I paced around our living room. Ma grabbed my arms and stopped me \"I know, I know and it stops today. I'm sorry I didn't stop this sooner but I didn't know how\" she revealed and I hiccuped as we fell to the floor together \"Daniel go to your room for a minute\" Ma said over my head as she cradled me. Daniel scoffed but did as she said, Ma took my face in her hands and whispered to me desperately \"Talk to me sweetheart, Let it out\" and so I did.[Chapter 11] Waking up the next morning I lay still in my bed just looking up at the ceiling wondering what life was going to be like now I had told my mother exactly what was going on with me, with my brother and how I felt, so would today be any different? Pushing back my blanket I sat up and ran a hand over my face I had no expectations that my relationship with my brother would be any different, Daniel seemed to have some kind of vendetta against me, Johnny and the other guys. Walking to my closet I quietly picked out the clothes I was wearing today and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror \"Great\" I sighed seeing how bad I looked, talking about your childhood traumas apparently took a lot out of a person. Opening my door I peeked my head out and ran into the bathroom to have a quick shower and ran back before Ma or Daniel could stop me to talk, smoothing down my clothes and fluffing up my naturally curly hair I gave it a quick spray with Aqua-net. Hearing footsteps out in the living room/ kitchen I knew Ma was up, I breathed deeply and opened my door like nothing had ever happened \"Morning baby\" Ma called from her spot in the kitchen and turned to me with a smile looking like Suzy Home-maker. \"Morning Ma\" I greeted back and sat at the table where Mom placed a plate down in front of me before taking the seat opposite with a coffee cup in hand, she wanted to talk. \"How are you feeling?\" she asked softly and I gave small sigh as I bit into my toast. \"Better\" I answered simply looking into her eyes \"I'm glad\" Ma replied but I knew she wasn't done \"Thank you for letting me in, I know it's not easy for you\" I just nodded and continued eating this false sense of reconciliation was going to be short-lived and I knew it. Hearing another set of footprints I knew Daniel was coming and by the look on Ma's face she was apprehensive about the situation too \"Good Morning Ma\" Daniel said as he gave her a kiss on the cheek as she got up and fixed his plate \"Morning\" we both grumbled giving each other the side-eye. \"Oh, I almost forgot here\" Mom started as she opened her purse and took out some money \"What's this for?\" I questioned when she handed me half and gave the other half to Daniel \"For the Halloween dance\" Ma told us with a smile \"Go out and buy yourselves costumes or spend it on your date\" She grinned giving Daniel a wink. \"Thanks, Ma\" I grinned and stood up throwing my bag over my shoulder \"Oh and I'm gonna be late home tonight, I'm helping the decorating committee with the Halloween decorations,\" I say and Mom nods \"Do you want me to pick you up?\". I shook my head with a smile \"I'm sure Johnny will bring me home\" Ma smiled at me and crossed her arms \"When will I be officially meeting Johnny?\" she questioned and I grimaced knowing their first 'meeting' wasn't a great one. \"Uh I'm not sure, soon, I think\" I spluttered as I quickly backed up to the door and opened it \"See you later\" I shouted awkwardly as I all but ran out of the door and to the bus stop where Daniel soon joined me silently. We were the only two waiting and the atmosphere was so deadly I almost wanted to jump out into the road just to get away from it \"So\" Daniel said and I repeated it twisting the ends of my hair \"How's it going?\" I raised an eyebrow at my older brother and huffed out a laugh \"Are you trying to make small talk?\". Daniel shrugs his shoulders and places his hands on his hips \"Oh god please save it, I know Ma probably told you some sob story but don't force yourself to be kind\" I spat at him as he just looked at me. \"Ma didn't tell me anything, I heard everything you said\" Daniel muttered and my stomach tightened, if I known he was listening I wouldn't have said anything \"Even if you hate me I think we should try to be civil in front of Ma\" Daniel said running his hand through his hair. Sucking on the inside of my cheek I nodded in agreement \"I guess we owe her that much\" Daniel nodded too and I got a good look at his face for the first time \"So what actually happened to your face?\" I questioned as the bus pulled up. \"You wouldn't believe me even if I told you\" Daniel mumbled as he climbed onto the bus leaving me following him in confusion wanting to know what he was hiding from me \"What the hell does that mean?\". I questioned as I sat behind him on the near-empty bus. Daniel sighed but didn't turn to look at me \"it's nothing\" I clicked my tongue annoyed \"It obviously something if you begged mom to move us back to New Jersey\" Daniel turned to me quickly his face screwed up \"she told you?\". I nodded and looked out of the window noticing we were getting closer to school \"Yeah she wanted to know what I thought\" I told him honestly \"about moving back home\" I added when I saw his look of confusion. As the bus stopped at our school I picked up my bag and walked off the bus \"Well what did you tell her?\" Daniel called as he jumped up to follow me \"I told her I like it here\" I answered looking around for Johnny. \"Well of course you do. You've had it really easy since we came here, fitting in great with the top dogs, doing good with the work, oh and don't get me started with Johnny and the rest of those guys\" Daniel fumed as he stood in front of me. \"What the hell is your problem? Don't forget that's exactly how I felt back in New Jersey, no one wanted to be my friend because they wanted to be yours\" I shouted back at him certain we were drawing a crowd. \"and leave Johnny out of this, he's done nothing to you,\" I told him as I walked into school passing a confused looking Ali \"Nothing, you think beating me at the beach is nothing?\" Daniel growled at me as he grabbed my arm. Snatching it away from him I let out a laugh in disbelief \"You started it, well she started it, if you'd kept your nose out their business you would have been fine. Don't blame me for that, blame the princess!\" I argued pointing over Ali who looked at us shocked as I walked away grumbling to myself \"What an asshole and they say I have a bad attitude\".[Chapter 12] Walking into the gym I smirked when a round of wolf whistles rang out \"shut up\" I laughed knowing exactly who was whistling \"Hey guys\" I greeted giving Johnny a quick kiss and wrapping my arms around him. \"So, you had another fight with Daniel\"? Barbara asked giving me a look as I frowned \"How did you know?\" I questioned taking some ribbon from Tommy \"Well Jenny told Hannah, who told Emily, who heard it from Sally who saw you and Daniel arguing earlier\". I just blinked at Barbara trying to figure out what she had just said \"Uhm, yeah\" I admitted as Barbara nodded before walking off probably going to gossip \"What about?\" Bobby asked blowing up a balloon as I moved from Johnny's arms and curling the ribbon. \"Uhm you guys\" I muttered knowing they were all looking at me \"What about us?\" Dutch questioned furiously as I turned with a sigh \"I don't know he was being really weird\" I confessed confused \"Talking about what happened at the beach with you two\" I added looking at Johnny who looked deep in thought. Curling more ribbon I noticed the boys were talking among themselves in hushed tones but I knew it was probably about what I had just told them so I kept out of it, I warned Daniel at the beach not to get involved and he didn't listen so I'm not getting into it with him. \"So, have you guys got your costumes?\" I questioned turning to the guys who look back at me with wide grins \"Oh god, do I want to know?\" I laugh as Tommy lets out a loud shriek \"We're gonna be skeletons baby!\". \"What about you?\" Johnny wondered tickling me with a plastic skeleton arm \"I'm not sure, I'll have to make something\" I muttered blowing up an orange balloon and passing it to Jimmy who tied the ends up for me. \"Why are you making it?\" Bobby asked looking confused \"Well I used my money on material for my Sewing class\" I sheepishly admitted as Johnny gave me a knowingly smile \"Well I can buy you...\" I quickly cut him off \"No, no way. I can make it\" I said putting my arms around his neck and giving him a sweet kiss \"Thank you though\". \"Ohh is it going to be sexy?\" I heard Dutch ask from behind me \"Will it be tight? Is it a catsuit?\" I turned with a raised eyebrow as Johnny chuckled beside me not taking his friend seriously \"You're such a pig Dutch\". Dutch threw a toy spider at me and I rolled my eyes playfully as we all continued to help decorate the gym, playing around with each other every now and then. I let out a loud laugh after making Tommy scream by putting a spider on his shoulder, loving the feeling of just being with people who like me for me. Looking over Johnny's shoulder I noticed Daniel watching us all mess around but he also had his eye on Ali who was helping Barb and Susan decorate, giggling to themselves they were having just as much fun as the guys and me. I knew Daniel and Ali weren't talking right now but that's because Daniel's avoiding her from some reason, he pines over the girl and then ignores her when things get tough, Daniel turns to see me watching him and backs out of the gym shaking his head. \"are you okay?\" Johnny asked looking over in the direction I was looking before turning back to me as I nodded slowly \"Yeah just thought I saw someone\" I said giving him a small smile \"So my mom wants to meet you again but for real this time\" I told Johnny nonchalantly I didn't want to spook him. \"Yeah?\" he asked looking at me surprised \"Yeah, we talked about some stuff and were all okay now, I think\" I explained as he nodded before grinning at me \"I'll make you a deal\" he started making me frown wondering what his deal was going to be. \"You come and meet my mom, then I'll meet yours\" Johnny bargained twisting the bottom of my curled hair looking as nonchalant as I did \"Deal\" I agreed putting my hand out and he took it giving it a shake before pulling me in for a kiss making me giggle. After finishing up the gym Johnny offered to take me home like usual \"I was wondering if you want to be my date tomorrow\" he asked sheepishly sitting on his bike as I stood by the side of him \"I know me and the guys are going in the same costume but I want people to know you're with me\". I grinned and nodded \"Mom's driving me and my brother but I'll meet you there?\" I said as he agreed pulling me into him before putting on his helmet and speeding off \"boys\" I muttered with a grin walking up to the apartment where Mom and Daniel sat talking. Sitting on the couch opposite them I let out a happy sigh \"Someone's glowing\" Ma commented with a grin \"life is great Ma\" I answered looking at her \"Well I'm glad baby but I think someone could use a little of your positively\" she said tapping Daniel knee getting up. \"What's up with you?\" I asked looking at Daniel's upset face \"Nothing\" he answered shortly playing with the band-aid on his head \"If you like her so much just talk to her, stop being such a boy\" I advised crossing my legs looking at my older brother. \"It's not that easy\" Daniel mumbled quietly making me sigh heavily \"life is not easy Daniel but if you go back to her with an uncertain heart, there will be drama and disaster for all\". Daniel over to me with a small smirk \"When did you get so wise\" I flipped my hair jokingly like a valley girl\"I've always been wise, you just never listen to me\" I laughed as Daniel nodded looking thoughtful \"Ain't that the truth\". Mom slowly tried to creep by us but stopped in her track when she saw us both looking at her \"You don't mind me, you two go back to being nice to each other. Pretend like I'm not even her, you know what I'm just going to...\" Ma walked back the way she came looking sheepish as Daniel and I share a look \"Moms...\".[Chapter 13] kimberly gaugh- I have no idea if i'm going to follow the second movie or not yet. Katherine won't be joining the Cobra Kai but she will be like an honorary member through her friends. Yes I have seen the trailers for the new series and already thinking about adding it to this story when it's released. Mom noticed Daniel and I were back in our not talking stage so we are once again ordered to spend time with each other, more brother and sister twin bonding time for us, that's how I was currently sitting in our maintenance man's home or shed it kinda looks like both. Mr. Miyagi was more than happy to let me in this time after Daniel pushed me into apologizing for my earlier behavior \"Happy Halloween. You like?\" The old man whose company I was enjoying more than I thought I would have said holding up a large pumpkin. \"Yeah, that's nice\" Daniel smiled before Mr. Miyagi turned to me and silently holding up the pumpkin with a smile on his face \"It looks great\" I agreed with a small smile unable to contain the joy the older man radiates. \"Passed school today. Lots happening\" Miyagi mentioned look between Daniel and me \"I gave Betty a list of things to do today, if she screws it up I will kill her\" I muttered crossing my arms thinking about the dull blonde cheerleader who was all too happy to help. \"Not literally\" I added quickly getting a look from Mr. Miyagi as Daniel rolled his eyes going silent \"What's the matter? You're not going?\" The older man asked my brother who folded his arms and shrugged \"No\". \"How come?\" Miyagi asked taking off his bandanna and put the pumpkin by two others \"I'm not into dancing that much\" Daniel answered walking over to us \"I don't feel like it, anyway\". I squinted at Daniel reading his expression as Miyagi hummed \"You're too much by self. Not good\" I smirked as Daniel gave me a small glare knowing something sarcastic was on the tip of my tongue. \"I'm not by myself. I'm with you\" he muttered taking a soda out of Mr. Miyagi's red mini fridge before literally throwing one at me as I muttered a small annoyed \"thanks\". \"To make honey, young bee need young flower, not old prune,\" Miyagi told us as I let out a loud laugh \"Daniel is not a young bee, more like an annoying pest\" Daniel pushed me off the chair I was sitting on as I laughed. \"I don't have a costume, anyway\" Daniel muttered as I frowned at him \"What about the money mom gave you?\" Daniel looked over at me sheepishly \"spent it\" I smirked knowing how true that was, Daniel was not good with money. \"Have you got one?\" He asked me quietly almost as if he thought I didn't want to talk with him \"Yeah I made one, it's nothing special\" I told him taking a sip of my drink as he raised his eyebrows at me \"Where's your money?\" I grinned from behind my soda can \"Spent it\". Daniel gave me the first genuine laugh and smile I had seen for a while \"Guess we're more alike than we thought\" I bit my lip and gave a small nod \"Yeah I guess so\" I answered clearing my throat awkwardly. Mr. Miyagi walked over to us looking deep in thought \"If have costume...you go?\" Daniel shrugged offhandedly \"If I went as the Invisible Man\" I looked at my brother confused, why would he want to be invisible? \"Invisible Man?\" Mr. Miyagi asked Daniel before looking at me for guidance \"You know, invisible, so no one would see him\" Mr. Miyagi just ahh'd before walked around throwing things onto his worktable. \"What are you doing?\" I asked him as he muttered to himself collecting more things, I looked at Daniel but he just shrugged looking as confused as I felt \"making invisible man\" Miyagi answered pointing to the stuff lay on his worktop. I nodded slowly \"Yeah he can go as a pile of garbage\" I laughed sarcastically getting another glare from my brother as Miyagi shook his head \"Katherine good at costumes\" he insinuated pointing the to pile of things he'd picked out. \"Oh no, I am not...\" I stopped when I saw the look on Miyagi's face and released if I wanted to get a normal relationship with Daniel like we've kinda had today then helping him with a costume might just do that \"Okay\". I sighed and started rifling through the junk as Daniel looked at me shocked \"You're going to help me with a costume\" I nodded silently picking up the spotty shower curtain having no idea what to make. Mr. Miyayi walked away as Daniel stood by my side \"Why are you helping me?\" I looked at him with a frown \"because you're my big brother\" I noticed Daniel's eyes water a little before he sniffed and looked away. \"I know I've been a shitty sister and shitter person but you're still my big brother, however much you may hate me right now you need me,\" I told him as I picked up a gold plated shower head. \"I didn't...I don't hate you\" Daniel whispered as I looked at him blankly \"I hated you\" Daniel gulped as I spoke to him honestly remembering everything we've been through, all the rough patches, the physical fist fights \"and now?\". I glanced up at Daniel whose jaw had tightened looking like he wanted to cry \"I don't\" I answered simply as I looked over at the shower head again suddenly getting an idea \"An invisible man huh?\". Gathering all of the things in my hands I went to walk passed Daniel and up to the apartment but I stopped looking back at him as he looked less defeated \"If you want the girl Daniel you need to go and get her, stop ignoring her like a child or else someone else will treat her the way you should be\". Daniel looked over at me surprised \"and whatever is going on with you right now, why you're being secretive and coming home with bruises, I've got your back. All you have to do is ask and I'll be there\".[Chapter 14] Groaning I stood in another pose as Ma squealed aloud \"Okay, one more picture guys. You two look great\" Daniel and I rolled our eyes as we smiled widely for Ma's camera \"No, get closer this time\" I looked at Daniel who looked back at me as we place an arm around each other before smiling again. \"I can't believe you made those costumes Katherine, they look really good\" Ma complimented as she finally put down her camera \"Yeah she did a great job\" Daniel nodded from inside his shower costume, I made it so he could pull the curtain around himself whenever he didn't want to be seen. Ma smiled at the two of us before pulling us in for a big hug \"I've got a good feeling about this\" she whispered making me laugh \"You said the same things about the palm trees\" Daniel rolled his eyes with a smile \"I really should've watched out for the falling coconuts\". \"Right, one more\" Ma giggled snapping a picture of us again \"I haven't had a picture of the two of you since you were babies\" I sighed heavily \"Okay let's not get sentimental, I have a dance to check up on\" I said clapping my hands hoping our Ma would move quicker. \"Betty?\" Daniel guessed as I rolled my eyes \"how hard is it so curl some extra ribbon and make sure everything is in order\" I sassed as we walked to the car carefully so our costumes didn't bend or break \"How did you even get on the committee\" Daniel asked turning to me. \"Principal Louis likes my 'tenacity' and thought I'd get the job done\" I answered as Ma opened the car for us \"What's tenacity?\" Daniel questioned as I looked at him silently \"You seriously need to pay attention in class\". Getting closer to school I could see Daniel shuffling in his seat \"You'll be fine, whoever you're avoiding won't know it's you unless you want them to\" I told him as I heard music coming from our school and decorations were put where I told Betty to put them \"Oh thank god\". Getting out of the car I made sure my wings and halo were okay as Daniel awkwardly shimmied out of his seat \"You two have a nice night and no fighting!\" Ma called through the open window as we nodded at her. Walking over to the door I stood by my brother as we both breathed deeply \"Well are you ready?\" I asked him as he nodded \"Wait let's not go together\" I frowned at him until he answers me \"Everyone will know it's me I here\". I let out a laugh and pulled his curtain across \"Have a nice time invisible man\" I smirked pushing him into the building as I hear Ma calling my name from where she still sat in the car \"I'm glad you and Daniel are making up\". I smiled softly at my mother knowing how hard it must be to have your only children fighting with each other and being at war everyday \"I'm trying really hard\" I whispered as she smiled at me tearfully \"Thank you\". Tapping on the metal of the car I said goodbye to Ma and walked into the gym revealing at how good it looked and how well of a job I had done setting it all up with the others \"nicely done miss Larusso\" I turned to see Principal Louis smiling at me \"Thank you, sir\". I turned to see everyone in their costumes and giggled aloud seeing the lone shower swaying back and forth to the music, hearing a whistle I grinned knowing who it was coming from and turned to see the guys dressed up like skeletons, makeup and all \"Oh my god you guys look awesome!\". \"Wow, Kat you look great,\" Johnny said to me as he pulled me closer to him as I noticed he was the only one with his hood down showing his blond hair \"Thank you\" I grinned as Johnny twirled me around and the guys all wolf whistled making me giggle. \"This place looks amazing\" I tell them as I look around noticing how much better it looks with the lights down \"Well you did a good job of ordering everyone around\" Bobby laughed pushing me gently \"I guess I'm a girl who knows what she wants\" I told him smiled when Johnny winked at me. \"And what do you want?\" Johnny asked me as the guys joked and laughed among themselves ignoring us \"Well right now I want to kiss you but I can't\" I admitted as Johnny grinned at me \"I never knew skeletons could be sexy\" I playfully flirted playing with the zip at the top of his costume. \"You keep talking like that and you'll be covered in black paint,\" Johnny told me huskily as his grip tightened on my waist \"Hmm maybe I don't care\" Johnny smirked at me whispering, \"I think you're wearing the wrong costume\". I looked up at him confused as the smirk never left his face \"I think a devil would be more fitting for you\" I laughed and wriggled my wings \"attitude of the devil, looks of an Angel\" Johnny laughed plating a kiss on my neck that would be black. The guys turned to see my neck and sniggered \"You're all jerks\" I grinned knowing they wouldn't take me seriously \"I don't think you really believe that\" Johnny laughed as he looped both arms around my waist as we lightly swayed together. \"Well there is one thing that could change my mind,\" I told them feigning innocence as they all looked at me expectantly \"Let's dance\" I called out as everyone in our radius whooped as me and the guys started to jump and move to the music. I laughed seeing them dance and noticing how funny it looked with 5 skeletons partying and having a great time as a high school dance, I was surprised how much fun I was having at the dance but I knew things were different now. I had friends and a boyfriend who cared about me, I no longer had to be the girl who hated everyone and hated life, I could just be me and I was just hoping that nothing was going to change that.[Chapter 15] Daniel smiled as he danced alone in his shower, his sister had really come through for him, something neither of them were used to but he felt sick that she didn't know the person she kissed every day is the reason he has to hide away in the first place. \"Help me, my flower needs water\" A voice called as a hand holding a flower was pushed into his shower, he smiled knowing exactly who the voice was and he was about to take his sister's advice, again something he wasn't used to. Daniel opened the shower curtain with a grin as Ali stood on the other side looking beautiful \"You've come to the right place, stranger\" Daniel replied letting Ali in with him. Just before closing the shower Daniel couldn't help noticing his sister dancing with some girls laughing and having fun but where were the Cobra Kai? Not knowing where his tormentors has only fueled his anxiety. Closing the curtain quickly Daniel and wrapped his arms around Ali \"I've never danced in a shower\" she told him with a laugh looking around his costume in awe \"Yeah, Kat made this for me\" Daniel admitted as she looked up at him in shock \"Isn't it great?\". Ali nodded with a smile looking happy \"So where have you been hiding?\" she questions as Daniel looks at her with a shrug \"I haven't been hiding\" Ali frowned confused \"I haven't seen you around\". Daniel grins at the blonde glad she had noticed \"You been looking?\" Ali shrugs her shoulder cutely \"Sort of\" Daniel laughs at her blase answer \"Sort of?\" Ali nods with a pout \"I thought you were still angry with me\". Looking at the gorgeous blonde in front of him Daniel frowns \"Why?\" Ali sighs remembering the last time they talked and how she had even argued with Kat \"Because of what I said last time I saw you\". Daniel shook his head immediately \"I've been thinking a lot about that\" Ali quickly interrupted him with a sad shrug \"I should learn to mind my own business\" she knew calling Daniel out on his business was a bad idea but she did it, anyway... \"No, I think you're right about facing things. I feel the same way and Kat kind of pushed me to make things better.\" the pair stood and looked at each other before Daniel placed his arms around Ali \"I just kind of forgot for a while. Thanks for reminding me,\". Ali gave Daniel as bashful smile as she lay her chin on his shoulder \"You're welcome\" they swayed together for a bit until Ali lets out a sigh \"He thinks he can do whatever he wants to people\". \"Who?\" Daniel asked pulling back from Ali as she looked up at him with wide eyes \"Johnny. I'd love to see him get some of his own medicine\" Ali mumbles thinking about her previous relationship with the blond Cobra Kai leader. \"What goes around comes around,\" Daniel says offhandedly as he thought about his sister and how happy she seemed with Johnny, how could he be so nice with her and treat him as if he was less than dirt. \"I'd love to be there when it does\" Ali agrees as Daniel's mind wanders, thinking about how Johnny could get a taste of his own medicine \"Me, too\". Ali grins and pulls back \"You want to go outside?\" Daniel pretends to think for a while \"You talked me into it\" pulling the shower curtain back they both laughed seeing a chicken costume running around egging people. \"That chicken is wild!\" Daniel exclaims happily as he watches the chaos in front of him \"That guy's using real eggs!\" Ali shouts as more people are egged \"He's great!\". Daniel's eyes widen as the chicken takes notice of him \"No!\" he shouts before an egg is thrown into his hair making Ali let out a loud laugh \"I'll be right back\" Daniel said with a grimace as the egg yolk dripped down his face. Walking into the men's room Daniel washed out the egg as best as he could with a smile thinking about how well tonight was going \"Johnny!\" A voice called out causing Daniel to freeze. Looking through the mirror he could see Bobby dressed up as a skeleton banging on the stalls \"Johnny!\" leaning over to look in the last stall Bobby banged on it heavily. Daniel stomach clenched as he saw Johnny stand up from inside the stall \"Got that number rolled?\" Bobby questioned as Johnny moved his headphones out of the way and nodding \"In a minute\". \"I'm going to get the guys and find Kat. Hurry up\" Bobby exclaimed as Daniel turned away quickly hoping he hadn't been seen, waiting for the bathroom to go quiet Daniel thought about his options. Walking over to the janitors sink he noticed a water pipe connected to the tap and suddenly he had an idea, it might get him beat up but he knew he had to try to stand up for himself. Seeing Daniel walking off to the toilets I slowly made my way over to Ali \"real eggs, huh?\" I asked as she gave me a small nod looking awkward \"I'm sorry for shouting at you yesterday\" she apologized make me laugh. \"no problem, it was like being barked at by a chihuahua,\" I joked as she blushed \"You know my brother really seems to like you,\" I started as she looked back at me \"but you don't,\" she said boldly. I raised my eyebrows in surprise before giving a small chuckle \"That's not on you, trust me. I've got a lotta issues, and you got caught in the crossfire\" I admitted as she just looked at me shocked. \"I'm not saying we're going to be besties now but for Daniel's sake I'll try not to be such a bitch,\" I told her as she gave me a bright smile \"thank you, not just for this but he said you talked to him about us,\". I nodded playing with my bracelets \"Just don't break his heart\" I warned as she promised me she wouldn't \"Hey wait, do you know anything about his bruises and stuff or who gave them to him?\" I questioned crossing my arms waiting for a name. Ali looked back at me like she was wondering whether or not to tell me something and just as she opened her mouth I heard screams and shouting coming from the guy's bathroom \"what the hell?\".[Chapter 16] I watched in shock as my brother came speeding out of the bathroom as the commotion behind him doesn't stop, glancing at Ali she eyed me nervously as Daniel runs towards us \"Daniel, what's wrong?\" Ali called to him as he gave her the shower head from his costume. \"It's coming around,\" Daniel said mysteriously as he looked at me nervously before running off again, hearing Johnny and the other guys shouting I frowned when I saw them running to looking furious. Ali leaned down with the shower head tripping Johnny up and the other Cobra Kai's fall down with him as I looked on in shock \"Get up!\" Johnny shouted as they all stand and run to the door leaving us all behind in shock. Turning to Ali I felt like a fish out of water \"What's going on\" I questioned as she just bit her lip like she couldn't tell me \"Ali!\" I shouted as she looked towards the door nervously and I suddenly knew. My eyes glanced to the door too before turning back to her \"No, no way\" I babbled \"No, no, no\" I chanted as I ran towards the door hoping it wasn't true. Pushing my way out of the gymnasium I looked around noticing a 4 car pile up. Running that was I slid over a car as a guy honked his horn at me, I just waved him off disinterested I need to find Daniel and hope Ali was wrong about all of this. As I passed the remnants of Daniel's costume I had a feeling she wasn't wrong at all. Following the sound of shouting and hollering I ran across a field which let to the back of our apartment building, as I ran closer to the building I watched in horror as my brother was getting his ass handed to him. \"Stop!\" I shouted as they all looked at me in shock, running forward to get to Daniel I was stopped by Dutch who held me tight in his arms as my brother looked like he was about to pass out. \"Get off me\" I squirmed as Dutch's arms tightened \"sorry Princess\" was all he said as Johnny looked at me regret in his eyes \"What the hell\" I questioned trying to fight against Dutch. \"It was you all along?\" I screamed as Johnny walked closer to me \"it was him, he couldn't leave us alone\" Johnny tried to explain softly as he held my face \"I tried to leave it alone for you but he just kept pushing it\" he continued looking at my brother disdainfully. I watched as Tommy picked my brother up and hit him as I fought harder against Dutch \"Let me go!\" I screamed as Bobby came over and grabbed my arms \"Stop it, Kat, just stop\" he tried to reason as the three of us fought. Feeling a sharp pain on my face I groaned realizing Bobby had hit me \"Oh shit Kat\" Bobby said as I stopped fighting \"I'm sorry, you were moving too quick. It was an accident\" he babbled horrified as I held my eye knowing he wouldn't really hit me on purpose. \"Just tell him to stop Bobby\" I sighed as Bobby nodded and walked over to Johnny as I felt my eye throb \"He's had enough\" Bobby called to Tommy who frowned at Bobby as he held my brother up \"Shut up Bobby!\" \"He can't even stand up\" Bobby argued again as I looked at my brother's slouched form knowing he wouldn't be able to put up a fight anymore \"That don't mean squat\" Jimmy called out as Johnny held my chin looking at my eye. Ripping my chin from his hand defiantly his eyes darkened \"Johnny, he's had enough\" Bobby chastised as Johnny turns to him breathing heavily \"I'll decide when he's had enough man!\". \"What's wrong with you, Johnny?\" Bobby questioned as I tried to move from Dutch again but he just shushed me gently and pulled me in tighter \"Johnny stop! Please!\" I screamed as he the others watched on. \"An enemy deserves no mercy\" Johnny chanted as the others minus Bobby shouted out in agreement \"Right!\" noticing movement out to the corner of my eye I looked over to the see our Japanese neighbor climbing the fence. \"You're crazy, man!\" Johnny started for Daniel but his kick missed Daniel when Mr. Miyagi jumped from the fence and pushing Tommy away, I gasped as Daniel's body hit the floor. I quickly made my way over to my brother when Dutch let go of me in favor of trying to hit Mr. Miyagi, kneeling down by my older twin I put a hand on his head in comfort \"I'm here Daniel, you're okay\". I watched as Mr. Miyagi made quick work of my friends and turned to me as I heard Daniel let out a harsh breath \"Daniel-san\" Miyagi shook my brother's shoulder as he dropped down next to us. \"Come,\" he said again and I had no idea if it was aimed at me of my brother but I spared no time in helping the older man lift my brother off the floor and pulling an arm over my neck as we pulled him up together. Mr. Miyagi unlocked the fence and we pulled Daniel over to the green doors that led to his home, as Miyagi carried Daniel through the door I looked back over to the prone bodies on the floor sadly. \"Friends of yours\" Miyagi questioned as I heard the familiar groans fall from the Cobra Kai's lips they were obviously in pain, glancing at the shorter man I had no idea what to say. They were my friends and my boyfriend, I had been so content for once and happy that I had found people who like me for me that I had no idea if I was supposed to hate them now for what they did to Daniel. \"I don't know\" I answered simply as I shut the door behind me and walked over to Daniel as he lay on a small cot a white bandanna lay on his head \"why not know?\" Miyagi's voice questioned. I shrugged not used to talking alone with him or anyone else for that matter \"They didn't hurt me, they actually made me really happy\" I answered honestly, I found it hard to lie to the Japanese man when he gave me those fatherly eyes. \"but Daniel is my brother\" I finished as my hand found Daniel's and I held onto it tightly like it would give me an answer for my pain \"Blood thicker than water\" Miyagi replied as he sat opposite me. I looked into his eyes as I felt my makeup start to smudge under my eyes, I probably looked terrible \"but what about love?\" I questioned as he just eyed me silently as if he was looking into my soul \"what about trust?\".[Chapter 17] Sighing, I looked in the small mirror hanging inside my locker as I gingerly touched the painful-looking bruise that surrounded my eye, although Bobby didn't mean to hit me on purpose it still hurt like a bitch, physically and emotionally. I heard from Daniel that he and Mr. Miyagi had gone to the Cobra Kai dojo to straighten something out with the guys and their Sensei but it hadn't gone to plan and now Daniel was involved in some tournament, the good thing was the guys had to stay away from my brother until then. Daniel had mentioned that all the guys looked battered and bruised from their run-in with Mr. Miyagi and he told me they all looked miserable which I think he hoped I would be happy knowing but since the dance, I feel like I've had a hole punched through my gut. \"Kat\" A familiar voice called from behind me and I turned to see Daniel walking up to me looking as bruised as I did \"Hey, you okay?\" I questioned following him to his own locker \"never better\" he replied sarcastically making me laugh. \"Have you seen them yet?\" He asked nonchalantly as I leaned on the locker next to his \"nope\" I said with a pop trying to act indifferent \"well stick close by, they can't get to you if you're with me\" he mumbled putting his bag in the locker \"sure\" I shrugged noncommittally. Seeing a hand tap Daniel on the shoulder we both turned to see Ali smiling widely \"I've been looking all over for you. Where've you been?\" Daniel questioned the blonde who looked between the two of us in disbelief. \"I don't believe it\" she gasped as Daniel and I glanced at each other \"What?\" I asked as she turned on her heel and walked away \"Where are you going?\" Daniel shouted as he ran over to her with me following slowly behind them. \"I'm going to find that idiot\" she announced as Daniel ran in front of her putting out his hand \"No, it's been taken care of\" Ali stopped and crossed her arms \"Until next time\". My brother shook his head quickly \"There isn't going to be a 'next time'\" watching the two of them I couldn't help but see the guys walking up behind my brother \"there they are\" Ali proclaimed obviously seeing them too. \"Watch this\" Daniel murmured to his girlfriend as I took a step back away from them all \"Hey, guys, it's good to see you\" Daniel called as he sauntered up to the Cobra Kai's as Ali timidly follows him obviously not knowing what to think. \"Sorry about your eye, Johnny. Your shoulder okay, Tommy?\" As Daniel said those words, I noticed just how beaten down the guys had been \"You guys be careful not to step in front of any more buses\". As Daniel and Ali walked away laughing Johnny threw down his books and tried to take a step forward until Bobby stopped him with his arm \"Hold it. Remember what Sensei said? Wait for the tournament\". \"It must be 'Take a Worm for a Walk' week\" Tommy shouted over to my brother and Ali who just ignored them and continued to walk away as Johnny picked his books back up. I froze as they all turned back to me and looked just as shocked to see me as I felt to have their attention on me, we hadn't talked since they beat up Daniel and forcibly held me back so I couldn't help him. \"Kat\" Johnny whispered looking unsure, but it was Bobby's face who seemed the most lost, after all, he was the one who caused me to develop the giant swollen bruise around my eye. \"Your eye\" He stammered moving towards me but I took a few steps back making all of them give me an upset or hurt look \"I don't wanna talk to you\" I informed them as tried to walk around them. A hand grabbed my arm pulling me to a stop \"Kat, wait\" Johnny begged as I pulled my arm out of his grip \"Don't touch me\" I hissed clutching my books to my chest feeling like I wanted to cry. \"It's not our fault Princess,\" Dutch began gesturing to the others as they all nodded along with him \"It's just like Johnny said, he was always the one finding us,\" I frowned at him knowing it was probably true \"then how come he was the only one getting hurt,\". They didn't try to talk that time \"I know my brother can be annoying and an instigator but there's five of you and one of him\" sighing to myself I gave them a helpless shrug I had no idea what to do right now. \"He's my brother,\" I said lamely as Jimmy looked up at me questioningly \"and what are we?\" A few tears sprung to my eyes \"I'm not sure\" I sniffed seeing their disappointed face. \"I had it all sorted out. Everything was simple; I hated Daniel, and I had you guys but now...\" I stopped as they hung on my words waiting for me to finish but I couldn't, I really didn't know what I was feeling. \"You still have us,\" Bobby promised as he finally met my eyes \"Do I?\" I fumed as a feeling of loss hit me \"because right now I'm having to choose between being there for my brother or choosing you guys and I can't do that\". Johnny and the guys looked upset as a tear rolled down my cheek, they knew I wasn't the type to be this emotional in front of other people \"It will be expected of me to choose Daniel, my mom will kill me when she finds out\". \" If she finds out,\" Tommy called out trying to look hopeful \"Have you seen our faces, Tommy? I think my mom will know something is up as soon as she looks at us, you can thank your previous assaults for that. If I'm lucky this time, she won't kick me out,\" the guys all flinch at my harsh words. Hearing the bell ring for class I visibly deflated I felt like there was a huge weight on my shoulder, letting out a pissed off laugh I saw them looking at me in worry \"I finally get friends who care about me and I'm going to be forced to give you up. Even when we've made up Daniel is still somehow ruining my life\".[Chapter 18] Tapping my pen against my desk I sighed holding my head in my hands it was the last lesson of the day and I was getting sick of everyone either staring at my face or asking what had happened to me, I had successfully avoided Johnny and the other guys even resorting to sitting with Daniel and Ali at lunch. Holding my lunch tray my nails scratched into the plastic as I looked around the seating area, I knew I was being watched by my friends as well as the other students who were still talking about my black eye it's like they'd never seen one before. Feeling a hand grip the sleeve of my shirt I turned to see Ali standing by my side a tray in her hands too \"come sit with me?\" I swallowed roughly wondering why she was being nice to me I mean we talked at Halloween but we hadn't really buried the hatchet. Looking over to the Cobra Kai's who starred back at me I nodded at the blonde girl who just smiled happily before leading me over to a table where Daniel was already sat, I guess this was my decision and by the look on Johnny's face I knew it was one I'd probably regret; it seems the only people happy with this situation was the couple sitting in front of me. Looking up at the clock I watched as the hand ticked closer and closer to 3 o'clock with every second, I knew if I wanted to keep up my avoidance of my friends I needed to leave quickly, once the bell rang I grabbed my books and bag getting up with everyone else \" Miss. Larusso !\". Grimacing, I mentally swore the one time the teacher held me back was the only time I really needed to leave \" dammit \" I whispered looking at the door hoping that the boys would have gotten the hint to leave me alone but after nearly being cornered all day I knew it was unlikely. Walking over to Mrs. Wilson's desk I pulled my bag over my shoulder and crossed my arms over my books as the middle-aged teacher eyed me in wonder \"How are things , Katherine?\" I frowned at the question and shrugged \" Fine ?\". Mrs. Wilson's eyes roamed my face, and I knew what she was looking at \"it's nothing\" I commented as she looked at me shocked \"just an accident\" I added when she looked at me skeptically but I was in no mood to be questioned at my life, or my home life \"and your brothers bruises?\". \"Look my mother is a broke single parent of twins, one who can't keep his mouth shut and the other who is a raging bitch with daddy issues but we're making it through. My mother is nothing but good to us and yes sometimes it's shit but that's life, can I go now?\" I gritted my teeth as I felt like I had laid myself bare for her to see and I hated it. She slowly nodded in shock and I huffed a thank you before walking out of the door but I soon bumped into something or someone and my books fell to the ground \" sorry \" I mumbled bending down to pick them up. Watching the other person mimic my movements I grimaced seeing Johnny silently looking at me with a frown on his face \"Hey\" he greeted softly as he helped me up \" Hi \" I whispered back unsure of what to say, I wasn't used to this kind of awkwardness. We stood quietly for a few moments before Johnny grabbed my hand \"Say something \" he croaked looking desperate as I huffed a laugh \"what do you want me to say?\" taking my hand back I felt my eyes watering \"what could I possibly have to say to you right now?\". Turning around, I began to walk away until I felt Johnny catch up with me \"let me go !\" I demanded as I was pulled back into Johnny's chest as he held me tightly \"Johnny!\" I shouted fighting against him as his hands latched onto my arms trying to hold me still. \"Just let me talk and I'll let you go\" Johnny promised as I stopped struggling against him \" okay ?\" he questioned making me nod in agreement \" fine \" I mumbled waiting for him to start so I could leave, just being next to him was hurting me worse than when I saw him pummeling Daniel. \"I didn't want it to be this way\" Johnny said as I felt his chest rumble against my back when he sighed sounding tired \"that fight on the beach was supposed to be a time thing but then he attacked Bobby at tryouts\" I nodded remembering that day, it was the day I officially met the Cobra Kai. \" Yes , we hurt him but he always came looking for us ,\" I turned around when Johnny's grip loosened \"we were done with him until that night of the party when Bobby found you, you looked so broken and beaten Kat and we all hated it,\" my jaw tightening as I remembered that night. Looking up at Johnny's face I knew he was being honest, and I also knew my brother wasn't as innocent as he seemed but I was still lied to and I knew for the sake of my relationship with Daniel I needed to try to distance myself from my friends \"You still lied to me, you both did\". Johnny nodded and crossed his arms \"so what now?\" I knew he wasn't used to this situation, being open and out on a limb just like I wasn't used to being totally head over heels for someone especially a guy like Johnny. \"I just need some space and time to think\" I whispered sadly hating that I was doing this, but I didn't want the only good thing I'd ever had to be broken by my brothers shitty choices in life, Johnny nodded as he gave me a weak smile \"I'm won't give up Kat, not on you\".

This is the end of the line\" Well this is it, the day of the 'Big Move' me, my mom a"},{"Movie":"Hansel & Gretel","Title":"A Fate Worse than Death","Author":"DevinBourdain","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9784482","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: The Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters characters are not mine, just borrowed for this story. Warnings: language and violence. Reviews are always welcome Sequel to Red in Tooth and Claw A Fate Worse than Death Edward shifted back and forth a little to allow the rough bark of the tree he was leaning against, tend to an itch that refused to be silent. He watched as the soft orange flames flickered, casting their light on the three sleeping beings curled around the small fire. The flames were just big enough to ward off the slight chill that had griped the air, warning that fall was fast approaching and not long behind it the cold sting of winter. Out of the three trusting souls counting on the troll to keep the night watch, Edwards eyes were drawn to Hansel curled at the end of the row behind his sister. Images of their last great battle ran through his head, particularly the moments Hansel had fought with Katja in the barn. The display of latent magic hadn't repeated itself in the jobs the group had taken since and as far as the troll knew Hansel hadn't breathed a word about what happened in the barn to Gretel. The hunter hadn't mentioned it to anyone, and the troll was certain that he believed that no one knew what happened, hell Hansel himself probably didn't completely understand what had transpired. Edward knew though; a burden he was now plagued with. A terrible fate was destined upon the hunter; it wasn't a matter of if but rather of when. His interference would probably be unappreciated and what good would it do in the end? Hansel had made his stance on magic perfectly clear and Gretel had made her devotion to her brother equally as clear. Knowing what evil lurked on the horizon wouldn't change what was about to happen; the question before Edward was would it be better for them to know the end was coming or be blissfully unaware? There was always a chance that Hansel's display of uncontrolled, unintentional magic had gone unnoticed in the world, a fluke mistake never to be repeated or possible again. The troll would keep his eyes peeled for any evidence that others might pick up on. There was no need to destroy Gretel's happiness unless he had to; there was always the off chance he had been mistaken. She was so relieved to have Hansel back, beside her, that Edward couldn't find it within himself to darken those moments, especially if there was a possibility it would be their last. As he watched his friends drift in the throes of peaceful sleep, he hoped they would never have to learn what became of those males cursed with witches' magic. \"I've got her,\" yelled Ben bringing his rifle to bear. The bullet whizzed through the air, hissing as it sliced through it, only to embed itself in the thick bark of the tree behind the witch. Bark rained down and Hansel gave his head a shake to dislodge the debris. \"Could we not kill me in the process?\" he choked out, the witch's arm impossibly tight around his chest. Ben gave an apologetic grimace while searching for another way to free his friend from the witch. The raven witch's dark eyes darted over her opponent as her razor sharp talons dug into Hansel's neck. The hunter let out a hiss of pain; there was no need for appearances, he was on his knees at the hands of a witch they should have been able to take out in their sleep; pride left when she got the jump on them. A low throaty growl passed through her beak like lips as her muscles tensed, arm slowly forced Hansel to his feet. Ben could see the witch was about to go in for the kill, ripping her prey's throat out with her massive jaws. A slight tremble ran through him as he tried to keep the gun steady. The window of opportunity was small, his opponent had placed the hunter in front of her making it almost impossible to hit her without taking out the man struggling in her arms. Ben did owe Hansel for shooting him in the shoulder when he was at the mercy of Muriel, but as much confidence the younger hunter had in his skill with a rifle, he didn't feel sure enough to risk the other man's life. He stood there frozen, watching the witch's hand squeeze tighter, her mouth getting closer to snuffing out the life in her grip. Ben jumped back, his finger slipping off the trigger as both Hansel and the witch toppled forward. A flash of brown and black pulling the demon free from the stunned hunter as three figures tumbled in the dirt. Hand still tightly wrapped around the thick branch she had used to knock the witch down, Gretel took every opening available to slam the hard wood into the soft flesh of her enemy. She was sore and bloody but she couldn't stop yet. This witch was crafty, strong and well versed in physical combat; not what they wanted to cut their teeth on after what happened in Sage. Gretel knew it was too soon to take on a job; they were still trying to find their balance again, build reserves back. The simple jobs they had taken were mostly misunderstandings, the wrongfully accused and those that had required actual skill, had been for a skill level far beneath theirs. But Hansel had been insistent and after everything, Gretel couldn't deny him something he clearly wanted, needed. It was a decision she was going to regret, she thought as she found herself flying through the air. Every bone in her body came alive with pain, eclipsed only by the sound of the thud as she slammed into a tree. Gretel opened her mouth to try and pull in a desperate gasp of air but her lungs refused to work. Her chest heaved in vain as her fingers curled in the dirt. Finally the spasms in her chest ceased and she pulled in a mouthful of air tainted with the taste of fresh dirt. \"Gretel look out!\" shouted Hansel, concern dripping from the words. Gretel lifted her head enough to see Ben picking himself off the ground while Hansel stumbled to get his feet under him and over to her. She was going to tell him not to worry about her, to pay attention to the witch but the dark shadow looming over her caused the words to tangle in her throat. The witch towered above, head cocked to the side as metallic black eyes danced over the prone body. Her feather clad back arched like a cat as she threw her head back to build enough momentum to slam her beak like lips down on the human's neck. \"Gretel, no!\" came the anguished cry from Hansel at seeing his sister at the mercy of the creature. Panic rose up, clawing his insides apart as he struggled to get his feet under him; he had to get up, had to move, had to save the most important person in his life. He had been failing in many things lately, spotting Gretel's secret foray into magic, the enemy that had been his right under their noses, the fact that not all witches were born to evil and now as the witch moved in for the kill, he was going to fail Gretel. The thick pit of desperation gluing him to the earth changed to a burning tingling sensation that welled up from deep within his being. It surged through Hansel, curling around his bones and down his outstretched hand that was too far away to offer any help to his sister. Like a tidal wave, a crackle of blue light emanated from Hansel's hand spreading out across the forest and slamming into the beings engaged in battle. The force of the energy knocked Ben off his feet, sending him tumbling back to the rocky ground, his head connecting with the hard surface with a sickening thud. Gretel felt the energy flow above her but the greatest evidence of its presence was the howl of pain coming from the witch who was no longer looming over her rather beside her writhing in agony. The witch spasmed and choked, the energy crackling around her, boiling her skin. The stench of rotting flesh flowed off of her in waves as the burning skin flaked onto the ground. A pressure built inside of her, pressing impossibly hard against her chest until she imploded, scattering her charred remains across the forest floor. Gretel closed her eyes as the smoking body parts rained down upon her. When the muffled plopping sounds ceased, she tiled her head to try and get a line of sight on her brother. Hansel, still frozen in the same pose before the wave of energy hit, seemed to be unscathed by the event, until his eyes rolled in the back of his head. Gretel swallowed back her alarm as she watched him flop down in a boneless heap. \"Hansel,\" she whispered as she surrendered to the fatigue forcefully pushing her towards the darkness clouding her vision.[Chapter 2] The firm, large hand resting on her back brought Gretel back to the world of the living with a start. Flinching away from the unknown contact, every muscle radiated with white hot agony. She frozen in place with a sharp gasp in an attempt to appease her body's protests and quiet the pain. Edward lowered his head into her line of sight, his eyes conveying concern more articulately than his words ever could. \"I'm alright,\" she pressed through clinched teeth. Looking around she took in the state of her two other companions, both unmoving on the ground. \"Help Ben,\" Gretel managed, surprising herself with how even her voice was. The troll looked at her as if to argue, but the determined look in her eye caused him to move over to the youngest member of their group as asked. He stopped short at the blood painting the rocky surface and steeled himself for the worst. Humans were very fragile and delicate, not the best for this line of work. With a gentle finger Edward poked at Ben's shoulder; the body moved limply but no measurable response from the soul that was supposed to dwell within. With great care he slipped his hand beneath Ben's neck and raised the boy enough to lean against the troll's massive body. Ben's hair was matted with blood that seemed to be still oozing freely. The bigger motion caused the injured man to scrunch up his face and turn into Edward's warm hand but still he didn't open his eyes. Edward's eyes paused on the red painting his hand; this was his friend's blood spilt. He never thought he would have people, human's no less, to call friends, let alone three and his silence had caused them harm. Quickly his hand roamed to the bottom of his shirt, ripping a stretch of fabric to wrap around Ben's wound and keep some of the precious liquid where it belonged. With great determination, Gretel pulled her left leg underneath her. It was slow, agonizing work that left her panting but she managed to do it. Bracing herself with a deep breath she got her right leg underneath her, her hand coiling in a tight fist to give her something to focus on other than the pain. Finally on her knees she began to crawl towards Hansel. Carefully she moved each limb, trying not to aggravate them further and cause her to stop before she reached his side. Hansel was eerily still and the familiar worry of losing him pressed upon her like a mountain. Her hands fluttered over every inch of him, frantically searching for any sign of injury, anything that would explain why he was unconscious. In the back of her mind she had a theory but it was too horrible to let see the light of day. She tried very hard not to replay events, Hansel's worried cry, the bright blue light that seemed to come from… It didn't happen like that, it couldn't have happened like that. A relieved sigh filled the silent space, as Gretel found nothing more than scratches and small bruises on Hansel. One horror was eliminated and the steady rise and fall of his chest promised to keep her worst nightmare at bay. Without turning her head she called out, \"How's Ben?\" The troll gave a throaty growl, pausing in his clumsy wrapping of the young man's head. \"Not good. Alive.\" It was all Gretel needed to hear at the moment; everyone was alive, that was something she could work with. \"Hansel,\" she barked at the man in her arms, hoping to see those pale green eyes that offered her so much comfort whenever things were going so wrong. No response. Her heart hammering in her chest she slapped him across the face hoping to knock him back into this world. The unconscious hunter's brow creased minutely but he remained dead to the world. \"Hansel!\" louder this time, the urgency tingeing the name with desperation. Gretel's hands coiled around his chest pressing him even tighter to her as though she could keep him in this world through sheer force. The weight of his prone body against her kept her grounded, reassured that maybe things could work out. They had survived worse before and lived to tell about it but what if they had used up their allotment of miracles already? \"We need to get them to the next town, see if they have a doctor…\" Gretel voice shook, the words on the verge of cracking as they left her lips. She flinched, tightening her grip on Hansel as Edward's voice hit her with a force uncharacteristic of the gentle giant. \"No!\" echoed off the weeping trees and stone cold cliffs. Gretel wasn't the only one startled by the shout, birds and other small woodland creatures that had taken refuge in the mighty trees when the fight began, risked fleeing their sanctuaries. Edward turned sharply to look at his friend. Her eyes were blurry with unshed tears and a look of fear he hadn't seen since she woke in his arms at the pond when they first met flashed across them. In a more subdued tone he added, \"No towns, no people.\" \"They need help. This is no time to worry about people's reactions to us or you,\" she hissed through clenched teeth. Every second they wasted could mean the difference to both men. The troll frowned and shook his head. She didn't understand, she couldn't understand, more importantly he lacked the words to make her understand just what was lurking on the horizon. This would not go unnoticed, it couldn't. They would sense it and come; the villages and towns would be the first places to look. Very gently he scooped Ben into his arms and ambled over to where Gretel was still kneeling on the ground. Slowly, as not to jostle the damaged boy anymore, he laid him next to the pair of hunters. Gretel's eyes were glued to him, following his every movement with a wariness he'd never felt before. There was tension between them, where none had existed before and it weighed on Edward. \"Take care of them,\" he said. His voice was remorseful; there was more he wanted to do, to say but it had to be this way. With a heavy heart he took his first step away, moving through the darkening forest and away from his friends. Gretel watched in horror as Edward started to walk away. Her anxiety began to rise as she looked at Ben then back to Hansel. She wasn't sure she could stay on her own two feet right now, let alone move either of her companions and the troll was just leaving? \"Edward! Where are you going?\" she cried, but the retreating figure didn't look back, didn't even stop. \"Edward,\" she whispered into the twilight; a silent prayer, that like all others she had made, went unanswered. The young woman slumped forward, defeat coating every fiber of her being. A feeling of loneliness unlike anything she had ever felt poured into her chest, stealing her breath. She had to do something, Hansel and Ben were counting on her but the constant throb that ran through her body made it hard to think. The vastness of the forest dwarfed them, leaving Gretel feeling small and week in its wake; her best hope had just abandoned them. There was no way she could carry one of them let alone two, assuming she could find her way to the next town. The area was unfamiliar and regretfully she hadn't been giving Ben her full attention when he was prattling on about the area, future work and the distance to the next town. A crack of thunder rattled the sky before the harsh whispers of the wind foretold of the coming storm. Ignoring the sharp, almost violent protests from her body, she managed to find her feet once again. Using one of the only skills she remembered from her father, one that was well honed through years of vagrancy, she began to fashion a shelter in the crock of a nearby rock formation. It wasn't anything to be proud of, but it was a shelter, something to keep them warm through the night until Gretel could come up with some sort of plan to get them out of the mess they so often found themselves. The last of her strength gave out just as she dragged Ben's body in the shelter. Darkness had descended blanketing the forest in dark nothingness which was held at bay by the modest fire the hunter had managed to start. Gretel fell asleep to the pitter-patter of rain, wedged tightly between her two companions as she huddled them together for warmth.[Chapter 3] It was like a strong wind blowing, the disturbance felt by all; a distinct shove announcing the arrival of another into the universe, one that must be quickly sought out and destroyed. It was an instinctual call felt by all those who were Lamiae, the need growing like an unquenchable thirst demanding they start the hunt. Closing her eyes, Helaina tapped into the bond between her and her sisters, searching their collective knowledge to see if anyone had laid eyes on the disturbance. The male witch needed to be found before the consequences were felt by creature and human alike. None had laid eyes upon him yet and so the search began. Using the telepathic bond that formed between all Lamiae, the few scattered in the region closest to the disturbance divided the land into manageable search areas. With her orders received Helaina began her quest. The only thing that would satisfy the thirst would be for one of the tribe to feast on the witch's blood, drain him dry and absorb the magic that threatened to be unleashed upon the world into their collective life line. There was a certain satisfaction that came from performing the kill yourself and Helaina was hoping that this time would be her rite of passage. No longer viewed as a child she would be a warrior in her own right, a first kill would cement her status as a hunter and earn her the respect of her peers, all of whom had already made their claim and sacrificial offer in the name of their sisterhood. Using her inhuman speed, she began to comb the country side, listening and smelling the air for any lingering trace of the magical wave that had rocked the world. All traces were faint and hard to pin down; the magic exuded still to fresh and new to pack a real punch, but it was coming. Male magic grew at an impressive rate which was one reason it was so dangerous. The Lamiae believed the covens were becoming too smart to let their mistakes live; the males often killed at birth to help stop them from exposing their craft to the mortals that seemed to be over populating the world, crucifying those who were different and magical. This soul had been allowed to live and most likely left on his own. There would be no one to protect him from the hunting pack. Helaina smiled, it would be too easy, all she had to do was track him down. The muffled thud caused Gretel's eyes to snap open, her hand desperately searching for Hansel's until her fingers coiled tightly around the lax hand. Shooting to attention, her focus narrowed in on the terrified man sprawled out in the dirt next to them. She immediately turned to the troll so casually standing over them as though he hadn't abandoned the group in their hour of need. Her sleep fogged brain failed to produce the question of clarification that she needed to voice before Edward leaned over the stranger, pointed to the three hunters huddled together and snarled, \"Heal.\" The man's wide eyes sought out Gretel's but she had no words for him, being in the dark about what was transpiring as much as he was. He trembled in the wake of the troll's forceful voice but made no movement. Edward leaned even closer; his face mere inches from the man and reemphasized his point. \"Heal them.\" The troll's hot breath tingled against the strangers face and the man clutched the black sac in his hand tighter before giving a short jerky nod. Satisfied that he made his point, Edward took a step back allowing the middle aged man to crawl towards his friends. The man went to Ben first, unwrapping the hastily bandaged head to examine the wound buried beneath. Gretel watched warily, tightening her grip on Hansel's hands as she watched the stranger the troll had brought tend to her friend. Seeing that Ben and Hansel were in no immediate danger from the intruder she launched to her feet, a frown passing over her face as muscles still not recovered from past abuse shuddered in pain. \"What the hell Edward!\" she shouted, getting right in his face. \"Why did you leave? Where did you go? And who the hell is that?\" The questions tumbled out of her mouth with the force of a series of well placed blows. A part of her was relieved that Edward had returned, that their group was whole and in the face of the strange and weird it was a small comfort but the feeling of abandonment, of loneliness that had surrounded her last night needed to be exercised. The troll's stoic features took on a small twinge of remorse but he didn't back down in the face of her despair. His massive finger pointed to the stranger he had brought, \"Doctor.\" It was simple answer that somehow mitigated some of the betrayal felt from the night before. \"Where did he come from?\" she asked, somewhat warming up to Edward again. Gretel had thought the worst when she watched him walk away without an explanation. Maybe seeking help hadn't been his intention upon leaving, perhaps having a change of heart along the way but whatever transpired to produce this outcome, the gesture was appreciated. Edward cocked his head to the side. \"Next town over.\" \"I thought you said we couldn't go to a town?\" She looked expectantly at her companion. Edward was crafty in his own way and capable of warmth and humor that most would never take the time to unearth behind the unconventional exterior. This was clearly a situation where he knew more than he was willing to let on. \"Gretel,\" croaked Hansel, panic setting in when he didn't have eyes on her rather a stranger with something foul smelling in his palm. Gretel turned, moving over to where Hansel lay, leaving the question unanswered in the wake of more pressing issues. \"I'm here. I'm right here,\" she soothed, kneeling next to him and grabbing his hand as it blindly fluttered over the ground. Hansel twisted his head out of the doctor's grasp to get a good look at his sister. Her smile was genuine and bright despite the cuts and scrapes that marred her face. \"What happened?\" \"Is he alright?\" Gretel asked ignoring her brother's pressing question. The doctor looked warily at his captor, fear of the troll evident in his face. \"I can't see anything wrong,\" he replied, \"your other friend on the other hand…\" \"Anything you can do for Ben would be appreciated.\" Her words were warm but forceful and filled with sincerity. The man nodded and moved back over to his first charge. \"What's wrong with…\" the words died in his throat as Hansel followed the doctor with his eyes, finally catching sight of the unconscious friend beside him. He snapped his head back to Gretel, an untamed fear dancing in his pale green eyes. Gretel's stomach rolled. How was she going to explain something she didn't understand? He wanted to know what happen and the truth was she did too but even after time to replay what happened over and over again in her head, she had no explanation. Hansel was always the strong one, the one who put on the brave face even when things were hopeless. To see him panicking, absolutely terrified her. Hansel closed his eyes and swallowed hard as again no answer was forthcoming from Gretel. \"It's my fault, isn't it?\" The words sounded so small as though spoken by a child and not a fierce hunter of witches. For all that she had witnessed, what transpired the other day, she couldn't say what actually happened but somewhere deep in her soul she instinctually knew the answer. \"It wasn't your fault.\" The lie comforted neither of them and like sand through their fingers the sense of completeness and peace that had enveloped them since coming to terms with their heritage fell through their fingers.[Chapter 4] Hansel sat next to the fire, his legs pulled tightly to his chest as he stared blankly at the flickering flames. He should have been listening more intently to what the doctor was saying, after all it was his fault Ben was in that condition. He just couldn't seem to get his brain to focus on anything other than the blinding blue flash that occurred just before everything went black. The feeling that had preceded it was eerily familiar. The same thing had happened when he thought Katja was about to kill him in the barn. It was an instinct that kicked in rather than a conscious thought he had employed. The whole scene wasn't unfamiliar, he'd seen the aftermath of what happened a dozen times before; witch's magic was somewhat unmistakable. Gretel spared a few seconds to glance back at her brother. He had been distant since regaining consciousness, verging on being down right cold towards her. She would expect the behavior towards strangers, even a little towards Edward and Ben when things hit a little too close to home for him but never towards her. Things were just starting to right themselves after the whole Andria incident and now it seemed like an even bigger wedge was being forced between them. The conversation around her came to a pause and Gretel turned back to the group surrounding Ben. \"So he's going to be alright?\" she asked. The larger man nodded slightly, looking down at the patient who was looking a little green around the gills. \"Yes, eventually. For now, expect dizziness, loss of balance, nausea…\" As if on cue, Ben turned over and lost his lunch. Wiping his mouth with his shirt sleeve he rolled back over and smiled. The dopy look was skewed slightly by his constantly drooping eyes but he seemed to be in a bubbly mood despite everything. Edward placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder as his head lulled to the side. \"M'good,\" slurred the young hunter, \"s'fine. Rrrr'we there yet?\" Gretel looked back at the doctor questioningly. \"Confusion is also common with a head injury like that. It too shall pass as long as he gets plenty of rest.\" The doctor reached into his bag and pulled out a small vile, passing it over to Gretel. \"Laudanum,\" he nodded towards the bottle in her hands, \"will help with the pain and allow him to rest.\" \"Thank you,\" replied Gretel, her voice flushed with gratitude. Hesitantly the man looked at the troll, who was showing the injured man compassion far beyond what his rough exterior would suggest possible. It was certainly more than what the doctor could have envisioned given the terrifying abduction from his home the night before. \"Can I… if that's all… am I allowed to leave now or are you going to kill me?\" Not willing to argue the sentiment about how they were the good guys, Gretel just nodded. \"Yes, you can go.\" The doctor began to back away slowly, keeping his eyes trained on the monster amongst them when an ear piercing howl tore through the sky. Everyone tensed immediately in the silence that followed. An icy wind blew through the trees causing the branches to moan like old men required to move in ways they no longer could. Hansel raised his head off of his knees, ears straining for any sound that would identify what evil lurked in the forest. His hand subtly slipped along his leg towards the knife tucked in his boot, the handle familiar in the way most people felt about home. Gretel let out a slow measured breath. They had too much on their plate, they didn't need whatever this was on top of it. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled in anticipation, her mind already calculating how many steps to close the distance between where she stood and her gun resting against the stump near Hansel. Nostrils flailing, Edward sucked in a lungful of air, the sweet taste of flowers in full bloom and wet dirt assaulting him. Underneath that was something else, something rotten. Before he could turn to warn the others of what was riding on the wind, a dark streak flashed across the camp. Gretel felt something move past her, her hair fluttering in its wake, but it moved too fast to lay eyes on it. A soft thump pulled her attention back to the center of the group, her breath catching in the back of her throat. Gruesome things had long lost their impact upon her but this one came as a surprise. The head of the doctor stared back up at her from where it came to rest on the ground, the body eventually crumpling to the forest floor beside it. She had been looking right at him when the creature streaked past them and hadn't seen it lay a hand on their guest. \"Gretel get down!\" shouted Hansel from behind her. She turned at his panicked plea, coming eye to eye with something she had never seen before. Its physical structure looked human, more so than any witch they had come across. Its eyes were a metallic purple which contrasted her flawless skin which had the barest hint of silver, perfectly. For the first time in years, Gretel froze for half a second. It wasn't much but enough for the woman before her to backhand her fiercely, sending Gretel to the ground. The second she hit Gretel, Hansel curled his finger tightly around the trigger, sending a perfectly aimed bullet right through her shoulder. At the same time Edward moved forward to slam her into the ground. The creature, though wounded, tossed the troll aside like he were nothing more than a bale of hay that needed to be chucked on the back of a cart. Hansel took a second shot, aimed more towards the head of the creature but its lightening fast reflexes allowed her to dodge the projectile with ease bringing her to stand directly in front of the hunter. With an impressive strength, she twisted the rifle free from his hands, letting it carelessly drop at their feet. He managed to slip his right hand free, his left hand still in the creature's painfully tight grip, and wrap his fingers around the handle of the blade he pulled out earlier. With practiced movements Hansel jab his hand forward towards her midsection burying the weapon deep within her soft flesh. The creature's eyes glowed, accentuating the hard line of purple that encircled her irises but she stood her ground. Hansel was helpless to move away, her hand crushing his arm as the other deflected his halfhearted attempts to hit her. The creature's lips parted as she tilted her head closer to her prey, revealing two rows of sharp pointy teeth. With a snarl she grabbed a fistful of hair on the back of his head, pulling to expose the hunter's neck. She latched on to his neck, teeth cutting through the soft flesh giving her access to the exquisite and satisfying blood beneath. Hansel let out a protesting grunt as she bit into his neck and began to suck. He could feel trickles of warm blood escape her lips and run down his throat to pool against his collar. Almost immediately a tiredness washed over him, zapping his energy and will to fight back. His head fell limply against her shoulder, but still she continued to drink, to feed, and with it he could feel her strength begin to increase. A warm peacefulness began to spread through him as his eyes drooped close; it almost felt like contentment and part of him wanted to forsake the pains of daily life and give into the feeling completely: heart, body and soul. Out of the corner of his eye, Hansel caught Gretel trying to get to her knees. The pitter-patter of blood dripping from her split lip to the ground echoed in his head like a church bell. He was suppose to look out for her, protect Gretel from harm, and though he knew he had never been very successful at his life's mission, no one messed with his sister and got away with it. The all too familiar tingling feeling sprung up, moving from his chest to his extremities. It gave way to a burning sensation, like someone had poured liquid metal over his skin, running and flowing over every inch before hardening and cracking to expose the burnt raw flesh underneath. The intensity of it was so great it tore a pained scream from his lips; the sound muffled against the creature's shoulder as she continued to feed unperturbed by her victim's plight. Finally the pressure reached an apex, surging from him like a tidal wave, washing away the world around him. Hansel fell forward, no longer supported by the mass of the creature that had been pressed against him; instead he collapsed in a pile of ash. A small smile played on his lips as a cold emptiness swept over him, cooling his skin and relaxing his still spasming muscles. The hunter wanted to respond to his sister's desperate cries for his attention but he couldn't find the words to explain how tired he was, how satisfied.[Chapter 5] Gretel's heart threatened to stop beating in her chest as she watched Hansel collapse to the ground, a bright red spot weeping blood down his neck. Her hand pressed against it instinctively trying to keep some of the precious liquid where it belonged. The wound didn't look life threatening but who knew how much the creature had taken from him. With her other hand, Gretel reached over and pinched her brother on the shoulder. It was part of a game they had played when they were children; if one thought the other was faking sleep, they were pinched for their deception. She knew he wasn't faking but the connection the action brought might reach Hansel. It had the desired affect and Gretel smiled as she caught sight of green eyes through narrow slits. Motion to the left of the hunter pulled her attention away. Edward was scooping up Ben and several of their packs. There was an urgency in his movements that sent a chill down Gretel's spine. The troll rarely did anything without purpose, his moves careful and thought out, but now he seemed to be rushing, fuelled by what appeared to be fear. \"What are you doing?\" she asked, watching as Ben passively allowed Edward to carry him in his arms. \"Need to leave,\" huffed the troll. \"I can see that, but what's going on? I know you know something,\" snapped Gretel. Edward took a large step forward. \"Need to leave now!\" He stamped his foot down hard to emphasize his point. Gretel shot to her feet, spitfire dancing in her eyes. \"What's going on?\" The pair stared at each other waiting for the other to blink or concede; neither happened. The tension in the air was almost alive and for the first time in a long time, Gretel remembered exactly what Edward was capable of if he so chose to pick a fight with them. His gentle nature masked the strength underneath and their friendship had served as a warm blanket masking the potential danger they all could potentially pose to one another should those relationships crumble. Releasing some of the tension building within her, Gretel changed her stance hoping that backing down slightly would help decompress the situation. They needed each other, more importantly she needed what the troll knew. \"Edward,\" she whispered, a quiet plea giving shape to her desperation. He let out a grunt, shifting his weight back and forth while scrutinizing every inch of the woman before him. After some consideration he said, \"Can't out run what's coming.\" It was a warning as well as a promise but Gretel could still hear the underlying sorrow in his voice. Gretel glanced back at Hansel, trying to thaw the cold feeling ripping through her. Horrible things had been hunting them their whole lives, it seemed that was never going to change. \"What's coming?\" she asked, her voice more forceful then she felt, though the words still lacked the fierce drive that she usually put into hunting. The big brute paused as though speaking the words would bring the threat to life, bring it upon them without mercy or respite. \"Lamiae.\" Giving name to the threat didn't provide either any comfort. Rather than the truth setting him free, Edward felt as though it was a chain, wrapping him tightly and pulling him down in to the murky depths of death. If anything it made the inevitable outcome more real. The name was foreign to the hunter who had the unfortunate pleasure of being well versed in things that went bump in the night. Based on appearances, it hadn't been anything they had come across before and as she wracked her brain for all the stories and legends she had come across, none of them mentioned Lamiae. They hadn't wronged one in their journeys, set out to hunt or kill one, so why would they seek out the hunters? More importantly, why Hansel? \"Who are they?\" \"Hunters of witches,\" grunted the troll. \"We hunt witches,\" protested Gretel. Edward shook his head like a wet dog. \"No. Male witches. Won't stop until they kill them.\" Gretel's eyes shot back to Hansel. The creature had seemed more interested, hell focused on Hansel rather than the rest of them. Her heart started to pound in her chest. How was she going to protect him from something she knew nothing about. Their brief encounter had proven that the Lamiae had a strength that the hunters had never faced before; what other tricks would they have up their sleeves? \"There has to be something we can do Edward.\" \"Never stop. Destroy everything in their path to get what they want,\" he assured. \"You should leave,\" croaked Hansel, struggling to sit up. He swayed slightly as he achieved a more vertical position but his gaze showed a strength and determination he wasn't quite capable of demonstrating just yet. Edward looked apologetic, but reiterated, \"Never out run them. More will come, many more.\" \"We'll seek out a coven of white witches, get them to help,\" tried Gretel desperately. The troll shook his head in disagreement. The Lamiae were whispers, a dark shadow that lurked on the edge of the supernatural world. They were the monsters that monsters warned their children about. \"No!\" protested Hansel, slamming his fist hard into the dirt. \" You leave, all of you. He said they were after me. It'll be safer if you all leave.\" He knew something wasn't right, not since the barn but he had selfishly tried to ignore it. Hansel had just wanted things to go back to the way they were before, before revelations that their heritage was the same as those they hunted, before the evils of the world sought fit to use them in their wicked plans. That desire to hold onto the small comfort of family they had pieced together was going to cost the most important person in his life theirs. Gretel flinched at her brother's outburst. Desperately she tried to come up with some alternative to what Hansel was suggesting, some way to appease him that was going to keep them all safe. \"Someone has to know a way to stop them, something that hurts them…\" The siblings stared at each other, neither wanting to address the elephant in the room; that particular concern would have to wait for another time, or at least a less heated moment, even if it had taken out the Lamiae. \"Everything can be killed.\" Snorting, Hansel rolled his eyes. \"You for one. Edward for two. And how about Ben there? That one's solely my fault or have you forgotten my little party trick?\" \"Hansel.\" Gretel aimed for it to sound disapproving but the tremble in her voice contorted her displeasure into something akin to pleading. \"Scary monsters aside, I'm the biggest threat to everyone here. I can't control whatever this is and I'm not going to be responsible for hurting you. I can't.\" There was a dark edge in Hansel's voice that threatened extreme measures, should his warning not be heeded. Gretel's shoulders slumped as she resigned herself to the situation. \"You're right, it's not safe to be around you.\"[Chapter 6] Hollow satisfaction filled Hansel as he watched his troop, his family, disappear down the road and out of his life. It was the right thing for everyone. He didn't have a desire to die alone, hell, despite what his lifestyle would suggest, he didn't want to die, but he wasn't going to be the cause of everyone that mattered to him being slaughtered at his hand or because of him. He was selfish enough to desperately want them around him, to feel the safety and security they would offer even in this hopeless time but he couldn't let himself be selfish enough to have them share his sentence. Not giving into that need would be the one thing he could do for them, to repay them for all that they had unknowingly given him. Hansel would self-destruct alone. \"You were supposed to go with them,\" he scolded, hiding his desperate need to have the one soul that truly understood him stay close by. He hated himself for needing Gretel so badly, for not fighting harder to get her to leave with the others. \"Your smelly feet and pigheadedness haven't driven me away yet, what makes you think this is going to be the thing that pushes me away?\" teased Gretel, trying to inject some levity to mask the growing terror plaguing her. Hansel turned and grasped her hand in his, preventing her from packing their things and taking away the constant motion that she had been using to delay the inevitable realization of the situation they were currently in. \"Gretel,\" he forced out from around the burning lump in his throat. The other words weren't as easy to force out, bunching in his chest and threatening to consume his very being with their animalistic need to escape his lips. Gently she cupped his face in her hand, her gut clenching in protectiveness as he leaned into the small comfort. \"We'll find someone who knows exactly what's going on,\" Gretel offered. \"Oh yeah? Where are we going to do that?\" snarled Hansel. In all their years as hunters they had never crossed paths with anything like this. It was safe to say that Edward had a fair understanding of supernatural things and the most he could offer was whoever they were after was a walking dead man. Even if it was some sort of mistake and these things thought he was a witch, Hansel doubted they could be convinced they were wrong. The troll had been afraid, knew they wouldn't stop until they claimed their prize; anything they did now was going to be delaying the inevitable. Worse yet, there was a dark voice that whispered in the back of the hunter's head that the Lamiae were right, he was destined to become the very thing he swore to eradicate. Witches were evil, they did evil things. White witches, that was something Hansel was still trying to wrap his head around, but something he wasn't faced with everyday. He could deny them, make his world right again by putting them all back into the one category that had ruled his life; maintain the black and white of it all. Gretel was a little harder to reconcile with his world view but the unspoken understanding to keep that part of her, that part of their past out of the forefront of their daily lives allowed him to live the lie, that it wasn't who she was. How could he look himself in the mirror if this was true? He didn't want this for Gretel and he certainly didn't want this for himself. The low-lying anger Hansel felt for their mother simmered within. At first it had been based solely on the siblings' abandonment; what kind of person left their children alone to face the big bad world like that? Harsh reality and resentment turned those initial feelings into self doubt and hatred. What had she seen within Hansel that made her throw him away like that? Later it had turned into hate and fear that she had passed on an evil that would haunt and consume them for all their days; now, those feelings were morphing in a realization that the evil was within. Hansel had felt something stir in him the moment the creature sunk its teeth into him. It wasn't fear, concern or even acceptance; it had just felt right, almost destined. Like always, Gretel was there waiting to put up a fight for him when things would be so much better for her if she just left him to his fate. It was one more burden the young man wasn't sure he could carry anymore. Without him, she could settle down, live like normal people. In the beginning it would seem like it was forced upon her, like the lack of a hunting partner prevented her from waging war on the unholy, but after she found someone to love all the little things about her that someone should, after she had a family to give all the love she mistakenly wasted on Hansel, she would be happy. Gretel tipped Hansel's chin up gently, pulling him from whatever thoughts were plaguing him. Her voice was sweet and coated with familiar casualness as she explained, \"If these things seek out witches, we'll find a coven. They'll have to know something, some way to stop them, otherwise there wouldn't be any witches.\" Pulling away Hansel jumped to his feet and began pacing back and forth. \" Male witches , they go after the males. That makes sense, cause when was the last time you ran into witch that wasn't female? And which coven are we going to go to? We don't exactly make friends with witches. The whole hunting and killing them puts a damper on that,\" snapped Hansel. Gretel let out a sigh. Her brother was angry at the situation, at yet another curve ball life felt compelled to burden them with, not her. Swallowing her frustration down, she tried to bury it and keep the focus on the problem and not her brother's attitude, no matter how much it stung her or how much the situation called for it. \"There's never been a shortage of evil witches, I imagine there isn't a shortage of good ones. We've just never bothered to look before,\" she countered. \"Good, bad, I don't think it matters. I'm dangerous!\" \"Hansel,\" Gretel called, causing him to pause in his frantic pacing, \"I don't think our mother would have risked everything for us if there was no hope, if we weren't worth saving.\" A myriad of emotions flashed across the hunter's face at the mention of their mother, all of them breaking Gretel's heart as she stood there helpless against her brother's turmoil. \"I'm not a witch, I can't be,\" whispered Hansel. Defeat swept through him sapping all his energy until he had to focus on taking his next breath. Part of her wanted to let Hansel live in his denial. Learning the truth had filled her with peace, while getting a handle on the magic within made her fell complete. Hansel just seemed to become more conflicted as their heritage became clearer and clearer. \"Our mother was one, that means a part of you….\" Hansel's hands curled into tight balls of rage. \"No. I'm not a witch! Witches are hags not men.\" What if their mother knew exactly what she was doing when she sent them out into the woods; two birds, one stone. Gretel would have been safe from Muriel and Hansel would have been left to the tender mercies of whatever creatures saw fit to prey upon him in all his unnaturalness, wiping clean the burden of dispatching him from his mother's hands. Gretel frowned at the unintended dig against her. \"You know what I mean,\" he corrected, before letting his shoulders slump in defeat. He could pretend and deny all he wanted but at the end of the day it was still going to be true; the only monster in the family was him. Sounding more broken than Gretel could ever recall hearing he whispered, \"I can't be this Gretel, I can't.\" Without thought, she found herself suddenly next to her brother, wrapping her arms tightly around him and whispering soothing sentiments in his ear while she tried to ignore the silent tears rolling down his cheeks. \"You should leave,\" he reminded her. \"You didn't abandon me to Muriel and you stuck by me despite how you felt about magic. Do you really think I wouldn't do the same for you, you're my brother.\" \"No, I'm some sort of freak that's going to doom us all.\" Gretel had always had an optimism and strength that he envied. Despite their abandonment, she had always held out hope that their parents were going to swoop in, confess their mistake and take them home and in the absences of that dream, that they would find some happiness and turn their horrid lot in life into something special. She had had the strength to deal with the witchcraft that lurked within; Hansel didn't think he had any more fight left to deal with what he was destined to become. \"We're going to find a solution to this, get those Lamiae of your back and then meet up with Edward and Ben, just like I promised them,\" Gretel assured him, her voice full of authority and determination. Hansel opened his mouth to refute her claims but Gretel continued, \"We'll get through this, even if I have to carry you to the finish line kicking and scream. I promise.\"[Chapter 7] Cocking her head to the side, Helaina strained her ears to pick up the soft subtle sounds of someone approaching. Her hand tightened around the blade strapped to her hip but she resisted the urge to pull the knife from its sheaf. The moonlight danced on the pale silvery skin of the approaching figure and Helaina felt herself relax at the welcomed and familiar presence. \"What news do you have to bring,\" Helania asked her fellow Lamiae. The witch they had been sent to hunt down and destroy was proving difficult. Not only was he more powerful than they had assumed but he wasn't alone. Even without having any control over the power growing within him, the two that were still together possessed an impressive skill in combat, one that was proving to be a thorn in the hunting party's side. They had already lost four sisters to the human's hands and though they would do whatever it took to wipe this threat from the world, the price was becoming far too high. Rosalinde reached up, slipping long delicate fingers under her eyelid until her finger could curl around the fleshy tissue of her eye and extract it from its socket in one swift motion. The muffled plop was the only sound as the eyeball was removed and passed over to her sister who offered one of hers in exchange. Helaina plucked the eye from the outstretched hand slipped it into her now empty socket with practiced ease. She blinked a few times as the eye slipped into position before closing both eyes and allowing all the images her sister had witnessed to pass through her mind. It was like watching events as though she had been there. The death of her fellow hunters played out as she watched Hansel and Gretel move through the forest. Helaina studied her foe, memorized their movements and resources. Soon all their tricks would be known and they would stand no chance against the coming storm. \"They're good,\" Helaina offered as she watched the last bit of information play out. The Lamiae had been bestowed a rare gift, like the Fates with the all seeing eye, these watchers of magic could share knowledge learned by each sister by sharing their windows to the soul. \"They can't run forever and they're running out of places to go,\" reminded the older hunter. Rosalinde had had the privilege of participating in two hunts first hand, though the prey had been mere children and didn't offer the same resistance that the party was experiencing now. \"No one will shelter them, they cannot hide.\" The younger Lamiae nodded. This victory would prove all the more sweeter because of the challenge. \"Ursula wants us to adopt more sisters,\" informed Rosalinde with a reserved gleam in her eye at the prospect of expanding their family. \"It's not my place to question our matriarch,\" whispered Helaina as though she was afraid the woman herself would hear her protests from so far away, \"but even if we find those worthy of integrating into our sisterhood, they will be too young and not yet blessed to our family to join us in this hunt. Would it not be wise to send experienced warriors to help with this task before replenishing out numbers?\" \"You're right, it's not your place to question,\" Rosalinde snapped. \"Those are our orders and we will follow. Report back once you have searched your quadrant for the witch. We lost him by the river and they were heading in this direction,\" she commanded before slithering back into the shadows of the forest. Helaina sniffed the air searching for any scent of the human before taking off into the night to stalk her prey. Hansel's lungs burned with exertion. The bone deep exhaustion that had set in from barely getting a wink of sleep before the hounds of hell were nipping at their heels each night was making it difficult to think, let alone move but he knew they had to keep going. The Lamiae had been relentless despite taking out four of them in the last month. One had been killed during another random display of concentrated evil disguised as magic emanating from the young hunter despite his desperate attempts to keep his powers buried where they had been carefully hiding for the last twenty-five years. Another had been purely accident and more due to the wrath of Mother Nature in the form of a rockslide, than any effort on the siblings' behalf. They weren't witch hunter for nothing and through painful attempts, had found ways to despatch the silver creatures from the world. The Lamiae first appeared to be impervious to weapons, healing from gunshot and knife wounds in mere minutes. Their supernatural powers were no match for a shotgun blast directly to the head as long as the blast effectively blew their head right off. With that discovery under their belt, well handled piano wire decapitated like a knife through butter. Proximity was proving to be the real bitch in the whole beheading equation. Gretel was hiding it well but the tell tale stiffness of past beatings was getting harder for her to hide from her brother's watchful eye. Every wound, every pause to take a breath was another 'I told you so' moment from Hansel and though he never said it, it was clearly written on his face, breaking her heart. If it wasn't for her constant pushing he would have given up long ago. It was getting harder to be the rock, to know that one moment of weakness on her part would be exploited by Hansel to give in and stop running. She pushed her burning limbs harder, gaining one more mile after one more hard earned mile. She knew they had lost their pursuer three hours ago but any distance they could put between them and the relentless creature would translate in a couple extra precious minutes of sleep further down the road. Hansel stooped suddenly, doubling over with his hands on his knees. Gretel's heart pounded wildly as her gut clenched painfully at the sight of Hansel, a thousand scenarios tearing through her mind. Had she missed an injury after their last scuffle and he was slowly bleeding to death? Was it magic related? \"Hansel?\" she wheezed, trying to get her breath back as she placed a hand on his shoulder. \"This is stupid,\" he replied, flopping down into a sitting position and giving into his body's demand for rest. \"No more right now,\" he pleaded, wrapping his arm around her leg as Gretel began to gently comb her finger through his hair. Her throat closed painfully around the sob fighting for release. \"Okay. We'll take a break here for awhile.\" They had been running both literally and figuratively for so long that she didn't have it in her to deny him this one request; not when he sounded so broken and defeated. A distressed cry in the distance brought both siblings to sharp awareness. Instinctively hands latched on to weapons as both found their legs and headed into the fray. No matter their personal problems or situations they found themselves in, the desperate cry of a child always trumped everything. It didn't take long to close in on the scene. There in the forest clearing were two Lamiae and several young girls. The youngest was in the clutches of one of the creatures, its death like grip refusing to relinquish the child to the older teen frantically trying to pull the child away. The other silver beast was standing over the dead body of another young lady while dodging the wild swings of a tree branch being welded by another of the older girls. \"Hey!\" shouted Hansel, swinging his shot gun off his back and bringing it to bear on the Lamiae holding on to the child. The second the creature turned his finger depressed against the trigger sending the projectile hurtling forward, shredding everything in its path and showering the young child in a mess of blood and bone. The other huntress stop short in her advancement on the other children, turning towards Hansel with a wicked smile. Recognition colored her face as she moved swiftly towards the ultimate prey that had offered himself up on a silver palter. With the threat distracted the two older children grabbed the younger two and ran towards the tree line. The innocent children out of the way, Gretel unleashed a hailstorm of arrow from her cross bow in a bid to give Hansel enough time to line up his second shot. Several found their mark in the fast moving creature but it managed to dodge Hansel's shotgun. Hansel grunted as the full weight of the Lamiae slammed into him, knocking them both into the grass. She pinned his arms down before bearing her sharp teeth and tilting her head towards his neck. Hansel closed his eyes as he prepared for the piercing pain of the creature sinking her teeth into his neck; instead he got a mouthful of warm thick liquid and dead weight covering his body. Coughing to expel the mysterious liquid, Hansel twisted to the side and managed to wiggle free of the weight pressing down on him. He wiped the substance from his eyes before turning to see what happened to the Lamiae. It took his sluggish mind a moment to connect the liquid as blood, not his blood, there was too much to be his. Hansel's eyes darted up to see Gretel, wire wrapped around her blood cover hands kneeling beside the freshly decapitated body. \"That was different,\" mumbled Hansel around a glob of blood he spat on the ground. \"They think baiting us was going to give them the upper hand?\" Gretel wiped some of the splatter from her forehead. \"I don't think they were using the children to lure us out. If the kids were bait, they wouldn't have killed one,\" she elaborated, pointing at one of the other bodies on the ground. \"Well that doesn't exactly fit with what we've learned. They were all girls and anyone who's bothered to give us two seconds of their time before slamming the door in our faces has said they only kill males.\" \"They wanted the girls for something and we should probably figure…\" she trailed off, getting to her feet and moving slowly towards the forest edge, her focus pulled to the sound of rustling leaves. \"Gretel?\" asked Hansel, slowly following behind. \"Shhhhh.\" She pointed up to the large tree and began to move around the trunk to get a better view of whatever was concealed high in the branches. With her brother standing a little further back, weapon at the ready, Gretel found an angle to catch a glimpse of who had been disturbing the branches. \"Why hello there,\" she said sweetly.[Chapter 8] The woods were terribly quiet in the wake of Gretel's discovery. A chilling standoff had presented itself and the hunter tried to make herself as nonthreatening as possible to try and elevate some of the tension. \"Are you going to come down or not?\" snapped Hansel, hefting his shot gun onto his shoulder. His voice was irritated offering no room for sympathy to the plight of the individual taking refuge in the tree. \"Hansel!\" hissed Gretel, turning sharply on her brother. He shrugged at her scowl and took a couple of steps back; kids were never really his strong suit. All traces of her annoyance vanished as she refocused on the young girl tucked up high in the tree, holding on with a death grip. \"We're not going to hurt you.\" For added reassurance, Gretel wiped some of the blood and grime that inevitably ended up sprayed across her face. The little girl looked through tear clouded eyes down at the pair; apprehension and mistrust rolled off of her in waves and her little fingers that were painfully gripping the rough bark refused to relinquish their hold. The monsters that had descended upon the small group of girls out berry picking for their families had been the thing nightmares were born from, but could people that killed such creatures be trusted? Monsters were by default bad, these people that had shown up and challenged them were a variable that hadn't presented itself to the child before. She bit her lip under the weight of indecision; stay in the tree or climb down to the strangers that had managed to scare away the beast? A sharp howl echoed through the land and all three flinched slightly. \"Staying up or coming down kid? We can't stay here much longer; you won't like what's going to be following us,\" warned Hansel with his usual brashness. \"She's already scared, she doesn't need you making it worse,\" Gretel criticized, giving Hansel a slap upside the head. This wasn't just about saving a young girl, this was the first time that the Lamiae had attacked someone other than Hansel. More importantly none of the children in the group had been male. Hansel hunched his shoulders at the hit but didn't hesitate to return the gesture, taking a half hearted swat at his sister's shoulder before pointing back to the tree. The little girl had shimmied down in record time, fear driving her from her previous place of refuge. She hugged the trunk tightly, not venturing closer to the siblings but the decision to trust them over the coming threat was clearly present on her face. Hansel resisted the urge to crow about being right. Sweetness was nice and all but in a jam, fear was a motivator that produced results. Gretel could be sweet enough for the both of them. Gretel kneeled down just within arms reach of the child. \"My name is Gretel and this oaf is Hansel,\" she started, her calming tone indicative of someone who would be a great mother some day. What's your name?\" Small hands picked at the threads in her dress that came loose climbing the tree as she rubbed her toe in the dirt. \"Mary,\" murmured the tiny girl around a trembling lip. Her voice was so quiet it could be mistaken for a whisper on the wind. \"It's nice to meet you Mary,\" Gretel returned with a warm smile. \"What do you say we get out of here before more of those creatures show up?\" Mary warily looked past Gretel to Hansel who was fidgeting, his hand tapping along the barrel of his gun. Eventually she nodded, allowing Gretel to scoop her up in her arms, though her gaze never wavered from Hansel for very long. Even without trying he had that murder you facial expression that made people uneasy. \"You wouldn't happen to know where home is from here would you?\" asked Hansel. It definitely wasn't an area the siblings had traveled before and only having a vague sense of the direction the other children fled wasn't going to keep them ahead of their foe. Wrapping her arms tighter around Gretel's neck, Mary nodded again, pointing down one of the trails. Hansel gestured for Gretel to proceed before he followed in line putting one tired foot in front of the other. It felt good to be helping someone again. The problem with the Lamiae had been unrelenting and all consuming, wearing both hunters to the bone simply to keep one step ahead. Any satisfaction that could be taken from their line of work had been forfeit to saving their own hides instead of others. It was almost enough to begin to recharge Hansel's energy had he not been pushed past the point of utter exhaustion. It was Gretel, her safety and refusal to give up that had kept him putting one foot in front of the other, fighting against the silver creatures that managed to get a little too close, a little too often lately. He was just about to ask for a break when Mary began to squirm frantically in Gretel's arms. The small blonde fidgeted like a person possessed, forcing the hunter to release her grip on the child. Immediately survival instincts kicked in and both siblings were mentally preparing for battle. The action to grab weapons was aborted however as a group of women ascended the hill ahead of them. \"Mommy!\" cried Mary as she ran towards the group, practically lunging into the arms of one of the women. Mother and daughter embraced in a tearful reunion smothering each other in kisses. One of the other four women took a step forward, placing herself between the happily reunited pair and the two outsiders. It was a defensive position that also spoke of authority over the group. \"Thank you for returning her to us but you must leave.\" The hunters stood their momentarily stunned at the reception while the remaining women began to shepherd mother and daughter back over the crest of the hill. \"Wait,\" implored Gretel, \"my name's Gretel and this is my brother Hans…\" \"We know who you are,\" snapped the woman, her cold hard eyes boring into Gretel's. What had started as a warm reception, the unification of a mother with her child which always hit close to home for the hunters, had quickly turned arctic. \"That is why you must leave, now!\" Hansel let out a huff before rolling his aching shoulders. It was more of the same. They had been turned away at every turn, firmly cementing the idea that they were well and truly alone. They couldn't in good conscious take refuge in any of the towns; they had no right to bring the Lamiae down on anyone and the creatures had made it very clear they would let nothing stand in their way to get their claws into Hansel. That had left them sleeping with one eye open under the stars along the backwoods trails that were conducive to anything but a goodnight's sleep. With the recent revelation of white witches, the small remote communities that the hunters had often passed through without notice or incident had turned out more often than not to be entire or partial sanctuaries to covens of witches; all of which had steadfastly refused to help or allow the siblings to stay, no matter how short their respite might have been. \"You know who we are?\" questioned Gretel. Their reputation often preceded them but she doubted it had traveled that far north that they would be recognized by sight alone. \"The whole magical community knows of the witch hunters Hansel and Gretel. Knowledge of threats to our safety is important to our coven's continued survival.\" The woman refused to back down an inch, maintaining her ridged stance before them. \"Please, you clearly know about the Lamiae. You can give us information,\" pleaded Gretel, though the woman's hard exterior seemed unaffected by the young hunter's pleas. \"They were after one of your children; perhaps we can help each other.\" \"They're after our children because of him!\" she shrieked, pointing a long boney finger towards Hansel. \"Me?\" Hansel choked. He was use to being blamed for a lot of hardships in people's lives but this was the first time it had been by a community he had had no previous contact with; usually they waited until after they started their hunt before blaming the hunters for their troubles. \"You're the one they seek and now you've put all our youth at risk. Leave now or I'll offer you to them,\" warned the woman brandishing her wand. The magic wouldn't do anything but frightened and anger people had a way of being dangerous. Hansel steeled himself for their continuous journey to nowhere but Gretel didn't seem that willing to let it go. \"We're just looking for some help. We…\" \"We're not going to beg, Gretel,\" barked Hansel. It was frustrating watching his sister give the situation her all, only to come up empty handed every step of the way. She was only forestalling his inevitable demise but watching hope being constantly dangled in her face was what was breaking Hansel's heart. \"But…\" \"But nothing. If they want us gone then we'll go.\" Gretel's hand clenched in to fists. No one was willing to help and worse yet, Hansel seemed complacent in the fact that there was no hope; he was giving up. Perhaps he had been giving up for a while and Gretel just wasn't willing to accept it, but she certainly wasn't going to. The woman had retreated back down the hill during their brief discussion and Gretel had never felt more alone in her life. There was no skill she possessed or idea she had that was going to keep her brother safe. \"Wait,\" called someone in the distance. Both hunters turned and looked towards the crest of the hill. Mary's mother paused at the top to catch her breath. She looked hesitant as she glanced over her shoulder at the way she came before speaking. \"You saved my little girl and I don't know if I can ever repay you for that but I want to try. I can't help you and you'll be hard pressed to find anyone brave enough, but there are rumors of someone who can.\" \"We'll take whatever we can get,\" injected Gretel, rather enthusiastically as the sparkle made its way back in her eyes. \"The Lamiae are charged with destroying threats to the delicate balance of magic. Males who are cursed with their family's magic can't control it and so the Lamiae hunt them down and destroy that magic. You can't stop them and you can't out run them; many have tried. That is why many covens have taken up the practice of killing the male children that show signs of processing magic,\" explained the blonde. \"So not all children of witches have magical abilities?\" Despite hunting witches their whole lives, Gretel had to admit, their knowledge base was solely comprised of curses and how to kill them. \"No. It's rare for a girl not to take after her mother but it happens. The first born male is most likely to be cursed but that's not a certainty. Some poor women have several sons doomed to a short life, which brings me to how I might be able to help. There is legend of a boy that survived his coven's attempts to spare him a death at the hands of the Lamiae. This story is forty years old making him the oldest living male witch in existence.\" Gretel perked up at the new information. If someone survived the Lamiae then there was a possibility that Hansel could as well. \"They say he found a way to hide his magic from them. If they can't sense it, they won't hunt you.\" Gretel's voice trembled in the face of possibility. \"How do we find this man?\" Mary's mother turned and pointed towards the daunting blue mountain in the distance. \"He's said to dwell at the top of the mountain.\" \"That's going to be a hell of a climb,\" Hansel scoffed. They were still several days from reaching the base of the mountain that covered the forest in the shadow of its might, let alone the days it would take to make their way up such rough terrain. \"But be warned,\" the witch cautioned, \"you'll find no friends amongst the covens, even if your mother was a grand white witch. The Lamiae don't have children of their own, they steal ours. That's why they were after the girls this afternoon; they were looking for children to alter magically and make theirs and replace their numbers.\" \"Great, so it is my fault they're going after other people.\" Hansel knew he was tired; he usually did a better job of hiding his miserable self introspection. Turning away from the group, he fought back the burn of threatening tears. His own mother didn't want him and everybody they met afterwards seemed equally excited to have him leave. Having another reason to see him as nothing more than a problem darkening their door certainly would never endear him to anyone. \"Then that's where we'll go,\" covered Gretel, taking the attention off of Hansel. She offered the witch a genuine smile, probably the first one she felt in the last month. \"Thank you.\" Unable to ignore her motherly instincts, Mary's mother reached out to place a gentle hand on Hansel's shoulder. \"I'm sure she had hoped you'd been spared. You are far too old to have shown no signs by now. It's a mother's greatest fear and a terrible burden for a witch to watch for signs in her son. I'm sure she thought you were safe,\" she whispered. \"How did you..\" stammered Hansel. He never spoke of his mother or the fears he had in regards to the subject, especially his newest crop of demons that had surfaced in light of his current predicament, yet this woman seemed to know. \"A mother can tell and you look so lost child. Now go, it's a long arduous journey and they'll be on your heels shortly. They say his territory is guarded by birds. Good Luck.\" Hansel and Gretel stood in silence taking in the task that lay before them. It looked to be quite the undertaking and they had already travelled so far. \"Last time I checked we weren't part mountain goat, Gretel.\" \"Well close your eyes and wish really hard, maybe hooves will appear because we're doing this.\" With a determined nod, Gretel took the first step towards their new destination.[Chapter 9] The rocky terrain of the broken mountain trail was lit in a dim blue hue from the pale moon over head. It was barely enough to keep the shadows at bay but gave enough to light their way, at least one footstep in front of them. Hansel's slow nonsensical ramblings had ceased half an hour ago, though the slow trickle of blood down the side of his head did not. Gritting her teeth, Gretel hefted her brother's arm further over her shoulder to support his increasingly growing dead weight as they mechanically put one tired and aching foot in front of the other. The numerous cuts and scrapes that littered her body burned and pulled with every breath, but still they had to go on. She just wasn't sure what they were going to accomplish except putting off the inevitable. Gretel was hopeless. She knew helplessness when their father left them in the woods. She knew it again when a witch chained them up in her candy house and again when Hansel became ill before a gypsy passing through town taught them how to keep the sugar sickness at bay. It was the only thing she felt when she watched Hansel fall through the hole in the floor at their childhood home after Muriel stab him and yet again when Andria had taken him. This was different; this was undoubtedly hopelessness in all its ugliness. The Lamiae were relentless, unlike any enemy they had faced before. At this rate, Hansel and Gretel would be the story parents told their children at night. A cautionary tale for those who thought to stand against the monsters that hid under the bed. One day these stories would have happy endings but as she continued on, she was hard pressed to think of any modern tales that didn't end in death and misery; theirs would be no different. The journey had been difficult and the terrain unforgiving. The beaten path had long since detoured from them, leaving a broken trail of birds carved into trees. They couldn't even say if the symbols really meant something or if they were chasing an illusion until fate could finally catch up to them. The symbols were based on stories and legend about the one they seek, passed down with gossip about neighbors and relatives until most of the story had been lost, except that the symbols lead the way. With no other options available Gretel had forced them to continue on, to follow a path to nowhere. The Lamiae weren't deterred by the difficult path chosen. The silver creatures continued their raids against them, inflicting more damage with each attempt. The hunter's weapons had little effect, nor did their skills which were rapidly decreasing as injury and fatigue set in. Gretel had even resorted to trying magic. Like spells cast by witches against the siblings, it had no effect. The only thing that seemed to hurt them was the unpredictable and uncontrollable magical outbursts exhibited by Hansel. Each time it happened, it bought them precious time and distance, but the toll it was taking on Hansel was undeniable. They were getting beat, both physically and mentally from the Lamiae and Hansel was being torn from the inside out by something Gretel knew he never wanted. Gretel never had any feelings towards magic, sure there were spells she hated but the craft itself wasn't the problem. She hated witches and all the other things that went bump in the night. It was the uses and the innocent lives that were affected by them that hit home for her but not the craft itself. Maybe it was her then unknown heritage that tempered her view on the subject from such a young age or maybe it was the distant memory always lurking at the back of her mind of her mother using it to protect her and Hansel. Hansel hated magic and its users. He had always been vocal about his feelings towards it from the get go. In his eyes it was the enemy, the reason bad things happened to good people. After Muriel's revelation, Gretel watched his hatred for it grow even more. There was no denying the roll it had played in tearing apart their family, it set them on a course that given the option, neither one would have picked for their future. Now the thing he hated the most was flowing in his veins to and Gretel could do nothing to ease that pain, like there was nothing they could do to escape their fate. The pounding thud of their pursuers echoed like a drum behind them but still Gretel kept putting one foot in front of the other, dragging Hansel along with her. They were out of ammo, not that it had been effective when they had it. It pissed the Lamiae off but there was a certain level of satisfaction in firing a few rounds into the silver devils. They weren't in any physical condition to offer more than token protest and Gretel was the only one still fighting mentally. If they were going to die, they were going to do it on their feet, working towards a goal. The hunter let out a long breath before steeling her determination to keep moving. They started this together and if she had anything to say about it, they would end this together, as a family. Gretel cried out as a pair of claws sliced into her leg. The sheer pain and force of the blow knocked her off balance bring both her and Hansel to the ground. Out of the corner of her eye she could see three pairs of feet circling them like vultures, poised and ready to feed off of the dead. Two descended on the pair, quickly subduing Gretel's wild, frantic punches and attempts to claw, bite and kick with the last of her reserves. An animalistic cry tore from her lungs as she felt Hansel's hand be pried from her steel like grip. She had given it everything she had and it wasn't enough; she had failed to protect her brother. The fear and sense of loss was lost in a river of pain and blinding light. The once dark mountain side lit on fire under the harsh and all encompassing golden glow that swept through it. It was so bright, Gretel had to squeeze her eyes shut and still it did nothing to lessen the intensity of it. The cries and screams of agony from the Lamiae, sweet as music, were lost against the pounding of her heart. If the creatures were scared, then what was coming was something to be feared. Gretel clawed at the dirt in a feeble attempt to get away from the light. The screams stopped and the light faded back into darkness but the slight buzz in the hunter's ears remained. She waited, tense for a blow or a fight that didn't seem to be coming. Slowly, Gretel lifted her head and blinked away the spots dancing before he eyes. Her hand frantically glided over the ground searching for some part of Hansel to latch onto. She came up empty, like the night. \"Hansel,\" she croaked, barely above a whisper as he throat burned with the effort. The silence swallowed up her plea and offered nothing in return. Gretel tried to suck in a deep breath but her lungs refused to cooperate, nothing wanted to cooperate except the tears curling down her face. She wanted to howl and rage at the loss but her body was too stunned and too numb to full process how completely alone she was, just how much she failed. A soft thud near her head helped ground her in the present. With a sly smile curling her lips, she snapped her head up to greet Hansel only to be confronted with a pair of unfamiliar shoes. Her smile disappeared in a flash, replaced with confusion and resurfacing agony. The cloaked figure stood there like a statue taking in the broken woman on the ground. The brown hood provided enough shadow to mask the stranger's features from view before bending over to get a good view of Gretel. The hunter strained her eyes to get a good look at the person before her, not quite sure what to make of the discovery. The man looked to be in his mid forties with soft brown hair and eyes that seemed to have seen more than his years would suggest. The thing that stole Gretel's breath was the thin black line that coiled its way across his face like a rouge vine. It was a start to the tell tale sign of witchcraft. \"You're a witch,\" she breathed. The world suddenly began to swim as darkness rippled over her vision. \"So are you,\" he replied before Gretel lost her fight to stay conscious.[Chapter 10] Gretel let out a soft sigh, reveling in the soft comfort that surrounded her. She nuzzled her face deeper into the pillow unwilling to forfeit the warm embrace of the blanket for the roughness of day. Any inn was better than a night spent on hard ground in the open night air, but it was a rare thing for the siblings to find an inn with this nice of a bed. Whatever evil thing brought them to such a nice accommodation could surely wait ten more minutes; it would be the least she could do in exchange for this rare luxury, after all, it didn't sound like Hansel was chomping at the bit to get going. Hansel… Gretel shot up in bed fighting the tangle of blankets. Her heart pounding wildly as the memories from before she passed out ripped and tore her former calm to shreds. They had been making their way up the mountain when the Lamiae attacked again. The pair had been over powered, Hansel's hand torn away from hers and… The young hunter looked around the unfamiliar surroundings, praying for some sign of her brother. The small room only contained a bed, a side table and a dimly glowing oil lamp. A spike of fear pierced her heart as her world crumbled beneath her. She blinked in surprise as he bare feet hit the floor. Taking stalk of herself, she realized, not only were her boots gone, but so were her clothes, replaced with a large grey shirt that was long enough to fit like a dress. Humility and anger ran through her at the thought of someone bold enough to disrobe her and the face that she had not woken for a moment of it. Like Hansel, her things were not in the confines of the room. Quietly she slipped out of bed, ignoring the goose bumps that prickled her legs at the sudden loss of warmth. Slowly she crept towards the door, nervousness making her rigid. Gretel had no idea what was beyond the door and worse yet, she'd have to face it without any weapons. Her hand cautiously wrapped around the door knob, turning it ever so slowly. To her surprise, it clicked open. Was it over confidence or stupidity that led the enemy to such and oversight of leaving it unlocked or was it perhaps a sign of a potential ally dwelling within these walls? Gretel slipped through the crack in the door the moment it was large enough, her senses heightened as she slid along the wall. The hall was dark except for a faint glow from the room at the end. She bit her lip; she needed to find Hansel but she also needed to know what she was up against. Pushing herself forward, Gretel stuck to the shadows. She peeked around the corner to the room with the light. It was a well sized living area with a large fireplace in the center of the opposite wall. The large flames danced within, painting the room in a pleasant glow while licking the edges of the pot hanging over the fire. Puttering around was the man in the cloak. He moved easily from the fire, to the book propped open on the table, to the shelves of jars and back again in an endless loop. Gretel watched for a few moments, waiting for the right moment to scurry into the room and duck behind the row of bookshelves near the end of the room. As he made his move towards the jars to retrieve another and add the contents to the pot on the fire, she made her move too. \"It's rude to lurk in shadows,\" stated the man without looking pausing in his task nor looking at Gretel. Part of her wanted to stay where she was. Maybe there was a chance he hadn't seen her, that this was some kind of trick to get her to reveal herself? That thought was quickly rendered useless as the mysterious man curled his hand with a flick of the wrist, causing the candles in the corner to cough and sputter to life while a chair slid out from the table. The man starred at the chair expectantly. There was no point in trying to pretend, Gretel was out matched at the moment. The man practiced magic with an ease that put most of the witches they had met to shame and she wasn't exactly on her A game physically or mentally at the moment. With as much fake bravado as she could muster, Gretel stood up and walked boldly to the table. She would show no fear in the face of his intense stare, even if it all reminded her too much of a house made of candy nestled in the woods and their captivity there. The hunter sat down, tense and full of nerves. Silently the man picked up a bowl from the side, blowing in it and rubbing at it with the corner of his shirt before filling it with the contents boiling over the fire. Gretel flinched at the sharp clunk as he not so gently placed the bowl and spoon down in front of her. \"Eat.\" There was no room for argument as he moved back to his book. It wasn't said sharply enough to be an order but not gently enough to be a suggestion. Instinctively her hand wrapped around the spoon and she hated herself for it; she wasn't that small girl anymore. She didn't have to take orders from anyone, especially one that was probably going to kill her. \"Where's Hansel?\" she demanded, eyes cold as ice. \"Eat it or starve, but I assure you, it's much better warm,\" he rebutted. In a display of childish petulance, Gretel swept her arm over the table, spilling the contents of the bowl and knocking the dishes to the floor. \"Tell me where my brother is!\" The man was a blank slate. If Gretel had angered him, she couldn't tell. Keeping his eyes on her he moved back to the table and picked up the dishes from the floor. \"What, were you raised by dogs?\" he asked conversationally, and Gretel hated him more for it. \"Most people are grateful for hospitality.\" \"Most people would answer the damn question.\" \"I don't know who Hansel is but I assume he's the man you were with.\" Gretel didn't reply, just sharpened her gaze. \"He's in the other room.\" The hunter's head snapped towards the closed door across the room. \"He's resting,\" informed the man with a little more force to his voice. \"He was substantially more beat up than you.\" \"Is he going to be alright,\" she practically begged. Mentally she counted the number of steps it would take to get to her brother. \"I imagine not,\" he snorted, sitting down across from Gretel with a bowl of his own. Hear head twisted back in the man's direction as cold panic began to set in. It was tempered only by the heat of her rage that the stranger could stuff his face while her world threatened to collapse. \"The Lamiae are after your brother; he's never going to be alright again,\" he elaborated, \"but I suppose that's why you decided to come here and darkened my door.\" \"But he's not severely injured?\" \"No.\" Gretel's shoulders slumped in relief. As long as Hansel was alive there was hope. \"We were told you could fix this.\" \"Well you were misinformed,\" he answered. He snatched Gretel's empty bowl before leaning back in his chair so it balanced precariously on two legs and filled the bowl once more. \"But you practice magic.\" Frustration began to build again as the man rolled his eyes dismissively. \"Don't pretend you don't. I can see the signs.\" A thin black line curled across the young man's face. As far as disfiguration from the dark arts went, the mark could be considered beautiful but it was still the sign of powers used. \"Doesn't mean I can help you.\" Pushing the now full bowl a little closer to Gretel he stated, \"Eat. You're no good to him half dead.\" This had been their last hope, the thing she had dragged Hansel half way across the county for. This was what she used to push her brother to take one more step and like everything else in life it was riddled with disappointment. Failing to keep the venom out of her voice she snapped, \"What do you care?\" \"It's inconvenient having to remove dead bodies from my house,\" he retorted with something reminiscent of the banter Hansel often plagued her with. \"Are you threatening us?\" \"You'll know when I'm threatening you.\" He locked eyes with Gretel. \"For someone needing my help, you're certainly hostile. A little appreciation would go a long way.\" \"For?\" \"Saving you and your brother from our friends back there for starters.\" The hard edge of Gretel's voice softened as she mumbled, \"Thanks.\" Her index finger tapped against the spoon on the table gently. \"I don't even know your name.\" \"Kaspar,\" he answered before turning his attention back to his soup. She needed to know for sure that this wasn't some weird coincidence, that they had found who they were looking for but what if he really couldn't help? She needed a way to save her brother. \"And you are the male witch from the stories?\" A small smirk played on Kaspar's lips. \"The one and only.\" \"Not anymore,\" corrected Gretel. \"A situation that usually corrects itself in time.\" \"Are you trying to tell me that there's no hope?\" \"I guess that depends on you.\" \"Is that some sort of proposition, because if you like certain appendages where they are, you'd be wise to cease your advances,\" she warned. There was something so infuriating about the man across the table from her but she wasn't in a position to alienate him for fear of retribution. Kaspar choke on his mouthful of soup. \"As thrilling as a romp with you in the hay would be, I'm not interested.\" His nervous laugh caused the threatening silence to disappear. Hansel and Gretel had made it a point to never need anyone in their lives. Everyone had proven they couldn't be counted on except one another except they needed someone now. She didn't know where she stood with this strange witch but she needed the kindness of a stranger now, she need him to be able to help. \"I should go check on Hansel.\" Slowly she got up from the table. \"Take him a bowl of broth and if he's awake see if he can keep it down. If not, let him rest and do the same. You're both going to need it,\" he instructed with what sounded like genuine concern. Gretel spun around to face Kaspar, he hands clenching into fists. \"Is this some sort of game to you?\" One minute there was concern out of her companion then next she was regarded with indifference or humor. It was too much for her to try and balance right now. \"It does get lonely here, and I do have to make my own entertainment but if you must know, it's not a question of if I want to help you but rather if your brother wants help.\" That knocked the wind out of Gretel. Hansel was as stubborn as a mule, forcing Gretel to make him do things for his own good. Here they were on the edge of possible help and it was going to come down to Hansel's desire for it. Normally there wouldn't be a question in her mind that he would dig in and do whatever it took, especially if it was for her. But lately he had been dragging, brought along by Gretel's determination alone. \"We can discuss this more when he's on his feet and know what he wants because I can tell you it won't be easy. Until then, you're free to help yourself to anything you find but word of the wise, if you don't know what it is, I wouldn't touch it.\" Gretel nodded before ducking into the safety of Hansel's room. She relaxed as she laid eyes on her brother asleep in the bed. He was pale and covered in cuts and bruises but he was still alive, still with her. She sat down next him and gripped his hand tightly trying not to think that perhaps she had just gotten in league with the devil.[Chapter 11] Hansel held his breath, not wanting to disturb Gretel. Worry gnawed at the edge of his resolve as he debated between the need to open his eyes to check what danger they'd gotten themselves in now, and getting lost in the warm feeling of Gretel curled behind him. Gently carding her fingers through his hair was a habit she had taken to when she was worried about him. They must surely be up a creek without a paddle for her to be so gentle and motherly in a way she only showed when he was sick. The revelation caused him to stiffen as he remembered that he was indeed plagued, not with a simple cold, but something much darker, much worse. \"Hansel?\" murmured Gretel, her fingers pausing as she felt the shift in his formerly relaxed demeanor. His breath ghosted over dry and cracked lips as he pried his eyelids open against the gritty feeling of his eyes. \"'m still 'ear,\" Hansel slurred, not sure if he should be pleasantly surprised that they weren't dead or just putting off the inevitable. \"Where's 'ear 'nyway?\" Gretel slipped her hand from Hansel's hair, shifting his head gently from her lap to the pillows. Though there were no serious injuries, he still looked like he had been through the ringer. Black and blue really weren't his colors. His eyes darted around the room but before he could voice his concerns, she grabbed a spoonful of the now cold broth and pressed it to his lips. Hansel scrunched his face at the overly salty broth but gratefully took it to sooth his rough throat. He could see the toll their current predicament was taking on his sister; the dark circles never seemed to go away, unlike her warm smile that never seemed to come anymore. The light in her eyes and joy in her voice had long been replaced with pale skin and worry lines. It killed him to know he was the cause; he always seemed to be the cause. After they had escaped the witch in the candy house and Hansel had started to show the first signs of the sugar sickness, it was Gretel that stayed with him, held his hand and promised that they hadn't survived the monster to have it all end that way. Hansel swallowed hard. He should have sent her away then, spared her from wasting her time. \"Stop that. We're going to get through this,\" scolded Gretel, giving him a gentle but firm smack on the side of the head. Somehow she always knew what thoughts were lurking in the dark recesses of Hansel's mind. He snorted. \"Been saving up for a miracle?\" \"No,\" she confessed, \"but stranger things have happened.\" Gretel paused, thinking about how she ended up hunting witches for a living with her brother, a troll and a boy that had practically made the siblings his religion, before choosing her next words carefully. Kaspar was a wildcard she didn't know how to read yet. \"We might have found someone who could help you with your… problem.\" \"Yeah? Who?\" Hansel's skepticism hung off every word. He had a solution to the problem. Hell, he had an endless supply of solutions he could load into his gun, if only he could convince Gretel to just let him go. He needed her understanding and her blessing or at the very least, her acceptance, otherwise she was liable to do something stupid. Hansel really had no desire to spend eternity as a member of the undead or something equally as horrible, should Gretel prove crazy enough to seek out someone who could do something so rash. And Gretel had proven herself to be just that crazy when it came to him. For both their souls, he needed her to let go. \"The guy who claims to be the only surviving male witch. At the very least, he can kick the Lamiae's asses and seems to be offering us shelter,\" she answered, almost daring to hope that salvation was upon them. As if the stories weren't enough to convince Hansel of his impending death from the silver creatures' hands weren't enough, the foreboding ache in his gut assured him of the one possible outcome to his story. \"And at most?\" \"He has a way to help you.\" Gretel clinched her fist as Hansel rolled his eyes. \"He's obviously survived, which means it can be done,\" she protested. \"At what price?\" snapped Hansel. The thought of running forever was as appealing as selling his soul and becoming the very thing he hated. Nothing was worth preying on innocent children to live, nothing. \"I don't have control over this thing Gretel! I've already hurt people, friends, who's next? You? I can't let that happen. I won't! I didn't want this Gretel. I'm not going to become like…\" \"Like who?\" she demanded, hurt burning every fiber of her being. \"Me? Our mother? Who Hansel?\" Hansel lowered his eyes. It was the same fight come back to haunt them. The inescapable truth that no matter what, this was who he was: the monster parent's warned their children about; the monster pretending to be a man. \"Like them!\" Gretel slammed the bowl down on the side table by the bed with a resounding thud. They had been on the same page for so long, and now the last year, they just seemed to be in completely different books. It wasn't like Hansel's hatred was anything new or some secret he had kept to himself. The truth was she couldn't even blame him for his attitude because somewhere along the line it wasn't Hansel that had changed, it was her. But still there was something just under the surface that she'd never taken the time to notice or question. It was a self-loathing that had only began to take root after their brush with Muriel. \"Why do you feel you have to be punished?\" The temperature in the room felt like it dropped a few degrees as Hansel stared at his sister. Denial and lies danced on his tongue begging to see the light of day and he desperately wanted to tell her she was wrong. Terror rippled across his face from to a combination of being discovered, and fear, that maybe she believed it as much as he did. Hansel dug deep, searching for the strength to offer some reassurance but he came up empty. He was just so tired and the truth came bubbling out. \"Because I've failed! I failed to protect you from this life. I failed in making sure you had a family, a safe place growing up. How many kids did we not get to in time?\" His hands were forever stained with the blood of those he failed. Witches were relentless and no matter how many they killed in righteous anger, more always seemed to slither from the cracks and kill more innocent children. And now he had to factor in the good witch angle. How many white witches had he killed in his haste to rid the world of magic? How many witches like Gretel, like his mother, like Mina, who had no greater desire than to protect their loved ones and live in peace, had he killed blinded by hate? \" This, this is a sign that I'm no better than the monsters we tried to save people from. In fact I'm worse. I was just pretending to be one of the good guys!\" \"Hansel, this doesn't change who you are. You're still the stubborn, idiotic, oaf of a brother you've always been,\" offered Gretel in a soothing yet taunting tone. \"And along with all of that is a loyal, brave, courageous man who's made it his life mission to save others from all the horrors and suffering he's had to endure.\" A small speck of confidence wormed its way through Hansel's cracks. Despite everything, and there was no one that had seen him at his lowest or darkest than his sister, Gretel still had faith in him, still believed he was worth saving. It was hard to ignore. \"You forgot ruggedly handsome,\" he added shyly. Gretel smiled, her first genuine smile in months. \"I haven't lied to you yet. I'm not about to start now.\" \"In the spirit of full disclosure,\" started Kaspar from the shadow of the doorway, undeterred from interrupting the tender sibling moment, \"You should know that the task you're about to set on should not be taken lightly. It takes a certain type of individual to rise above the magic and not let it consume them. Though I guess if it was easy, everyone would do it.\" Yeah, easy, thought Hansel as he took his first look at their supposed savior and the telltale lines of dark magic that decorated his face. He had a terrible feeling his struggles were just beginning.[Chapter 12] Five Weeks later Hansel staggered into his little room and collapsed on the bed. He was exhausted and hurting in places he didn't even know he could hurt. Kaspar, the fascist slave driver, was relentless in his supposed training, which if Hansel was being honest, was not going well. Maybe it was because he felt absolutely ridiculous doing the man's stupid exercises, both physical and mental. Really, where did the man come up with some of this stuff? Meditation? Hansel was pretty sure there weren't a lot of thoughts in his head to clear to start with, but being told to think about nothing seemed to spur every thought he ever had to come and overload his brain. It hadn't stopped the weird magical outbursts, but they hadn't increased in frequency either; a small victory among the many and endless amount of losses. At least he had a better sense of when they were about to erupt; the feeling becoming uncomfortably more familiar. Understanding of their forewarning had kept Gretel out of the line of fire and their host, though Hansel couldn't conjure up feelings about the latter, one way or another. The fact that the people he did care about weren't being hurt anymore was one of the only things that kept Hansel from wandering past the magical walls protecting Kaspar's attempt at paradise. Out of the two of them, Gretel seemed to be more interested in what Kaspar had to say, the wisdom he decided to grace them with. Then again, she had always been the one to show more interest in understanding and studying the monsters they were hunting. Hansel just wanted a good weapon and someone to point him in the right direction. His survival had always been attributed to Gretel's brilliant and inquisitive mind. It still sent chills down his spine at how fast she picked up what Kaspar was spewing out. If he wasn't sure this was his only chance, he would drag his sister from this place and this man, so obviously not squarely on the side of right, kicking and screaming, if only for her own good. Hansel wanted to be grateful, at the very least for saving Gretel from sharing his fate at the hands of the Lamiae, though there seemed to be an undercurrent of ulterior motive to be too grateful for Kaspar saving him. Still, he had promised Gretel he would put the effort in and so like a trained animal, he instinctively reached for the thick, black, leather bound book that was permanently located on the side table in his room. The pages well worn before he even received the book, becoming creased and tattered with his repeated use. The secrets within the black book, written in Kaspar's hasty scrawl, documented his own struggle from the same position Hansel found himself now. The literature was clearly written by someone blessed with an education far greater than anything the hunter was capable of, let alone could dream of acquiring had he had every advantage in this world, and when the man got on a roll, Hansel's understanding dropped from every third word to every tenth, but he muddled through all the same. Days all followed the same pattern. Mornings were for chores around the house and the only time Hansel felt particularly useful. Hard labor he could do without question and it was a nice break from the constant torment of the supernatural world he was being submerged in. It was the one time of day he didn't feel like he was drowning. Gretel had been tasked with the cooking, much to her distain and Hansel couldn't help but smile every time she not so subtly dropped their plates of subpar food in front of the men. Hansel dredged the afternoons and their apparent nothingness that stretched on until the sun began to set. Kaspar called it progress and gaining self-control, while Hansel called it a lot of sitting around chanting and performing ridiculous exercises that never produced the same results as when Kaspar did them. The nothingness, however, always left him exhausted and aching. The hunter placed his leather bookmark between the pages and set the book back on the side table. Barely summoning enough energy he leaned over and blew out the candle plunging the room into much welcomed darkness. The nightmares were the worst, not that Hansel's dreams had become anything other than weird. They varied between being roasted alive at the Candy Witch's house, to Muriel peeling off his flesh, to Andrea's cave, to being drowned in bright green light. The latter always left him breathlessly tangled up in the sheets with Gretel gently trying to wake him. He had always had the occasional nightmare about the work he had devoted his life to; usually they decreased in frequency the further away they travelled, but these ones were different, more relentless, more vivid, more real. Stifling a yawn, Hansel stumbled to the kitchen table and plopped down in the nearest chair. The shining sun of moning and chirping birds a stark contrast to how he felt. Kaspar didn't bother to pry his nose out of a rather large and ancient looking book he had propped in his lap but Gretel paused in setting Hansel's breakfast down. \"You look like shit,\" she mused. \"Didn't sleep much,\" muttered Hansel. Pushing his plate of Gretel's attempt at oatmeal aside, he pillowed his head on his arm and let his eyes drift close. \"We're going to need some supplies from town,\" informed Kaspar in his usual cold detached voice. \"I thought you had everything you needed up here?\" asked Gretel, joining the men at the table. \"I'm self sufficient in most things but there are a few things I have to procure from town.\" He picked up the rather flat looking biscuit from his plate and tapped it against the edge of the table to demonstrate its hard inedibleness. \"Besides, it might be nice to have some fresh bread by someone who can cook.\" Gretel scowled and took a bite of her own breakfast. It took some effort but she wasn't willing to let it show that she felt the same way about the food. She was a witch hunter, not a housewife. Baking fresh bread wasn't exactly a skill she needed to perfect. \"How long will you be gone?\" \"I'm not going, you are,\" Kaspar corrected. Hansel had only been partially following the conversation and snapped his head up, clearly having misheard. \"Who's going where?\" \"Your sister is going to town and get us some supplies,\" clarified Kaspar, enunciating each word as though Hansel was being especially stupid. Gretel looked surprise but it was Hansel who bit out, \"The Lamiae are out there.\" \"They're not looking for her, in fact, they want nothing to do with her . Where ever you are, that's where they'll be lurking, as long as you stay here, they'll stay in the area; kept out by my magical barrier of course.\" Hansel clenched his jaw. It was one thing for Gretel to treat him like a child sometimes, it was another thing when Kaspar did it. \"It's too dangerous for her to go alone!\" Kaspar placed his book down on the table and looked Hansel square in the eye. \"You can't go for obvious reasons and I can't leave you alone, so that leaves on option. She got you this far, surely this task isn't beyond her. Besides, there's a trail known only to me that leads to an off the trail village. They're happy to supply me with what I need and Gretel shouldn't run into any problems. It's the least she can do for the hospitality I've shown you two.\" Hansel wanted nothing more than to punch the smug man sitting across the table from him and tell him where he could shove his hospitality but Gretel's hand on his arm stopped him. Gretel looked at her brother imploringly. \"It's fine Hansel. I can do it.\" The ' we need his help' went unsaid. Hansel hated being indebted to anyone but he especially hated Gretel being indebted to anyone because of him. It always came down to the same problem, Hansel had to take Gretel away from here but if he did that before he had his curse under control, then he was a big a threat to his sister as anyone else. He resolved to work harder, to try harder. \"I'll show you which mule to use to pull the wagon,\" offered Kaspar, rising out of his seat and heading to the shed that housed the animals. Hansel leaned against a fence post watching Kaspar hook the mule to the wagon. He couldn't hide his glare and part of him didn't want to. He softened slightly at Gretel's touch. Gretel let her hand slip off Hansel's shoulder to help hoist her bag that was slipping down. Her smile was bright in an attempt to reassure. \"It will be alright,\" she whispered. \"It's not like I haven't done things on my own before,\" she added, gesturing to her bag and the weapons undoubtedly hidden within. Hansel tried to conjure up a smile but it didn't reach his eyes. \"Just be careful out there. I have a bad feeling about this.\" \"You always have a bad feeling,\" she teased. \"And I'm always right. One day there and one day back Gretel. Any longer and I'm coming to get you, Lamiae be damned.\" Gretel ruffled her brother's hair before walking over to throw her bag on the cart. Grabbing the mule by the reigns, she began her long walk down the mountain through a trail in one of the crevasses Kaspar had carved out. Hansel stood there ignoring the feeling of unease turning his stomach, until he could no longer see any sign of Gretel. She was right, under normal circumstances he wouldn't' have thought twice about her going off on her own but then again, he never had such a foreboding feeling before. \"Now that your protector has left,\" started Kaspar as Hansel turned towards him. Before the hunter could say anything a bright green light enveloped him setting every nerve on fire. His legs buckled as the ground rushed up to meet Hansel and then he knew nothing but black. \"We can begin,\" finished Kaspar as he stood over Hansel's unconscious form.[Chapter 13] Hansel awoke coughing and sputtering as the ice water ran in rivets down his body and in his mouth. He felt fuzzy and slow, but his memory was crystal clear. The second his muscles could bare weight he shot to his feet, anger fueling his movements and unrelenting glare. Kaspar was casually leaning against the fence, empty bucket dangling in his hand and looking bored. \"What the hell?\" Hansel choked out, still struggling to find his equilibrium and make sense of the situation beyond having been attacked by someone who didn't feel the need to finish the job. He was both thankful and insulted. Kaspar pulled a loose thread from his shoulder and absently dropped it in the dirt. \"Calm down, or don't. I think I might get the reaction I'm looking for if you stay all riled up.\" There was a clinical detachment to his voice and Hansel felt like a specimen in a display jar at one of the local doctors the siblings had first sought out when Hansel had become sick as a child. The words didn't seem to permeate Hansel's brain in a way that made sense and a silence stretched between the two men, framed only by the hunter's raged breaths. He never considered himself a man of many words but even Hansel's few words seemed to be failing him. \"What the hell?\" he repeated, with little hope of receiving an answer he could make sense out of. Shaking his head dismissively, Kaspar flicked his wrist bring his hand palm side up with his index finger pointing directly at Hansel. It was like a bolt of energy smashing into Hansel's left leg. The pain was brief but intense and his knee buckled under the strain. Dropping to his knee, he clenched his hands in to fists by his side, grinding his teeth in a vain attempt to distract himself from the agony and lingering numbness. Kaspar tossed the bucket to the side, letting it hit the ground with a muted thud. Without urgency or apparent purpose he sauntered over to the kneeling man. Undeterred by the hostility radiating off of Hansel, he smiled. \"Your sister coddles you too much. More importantly, despite your promise to her to try, I think you're holding back.\" \"And what would you know,\" snarled Hansel, barely getting his breathing back under control. \"I know you should have made more progress by now. Did you know the first born male witch is almost certain to inherit their mother's magic and demonstrate it within the first year of their life? A second born male witch will demonstrate their power, should they inherit it, by age five and after that should any other male heirs be produced and possess magic, they will demonstrate it by their twelfth year. The most rare and latest case I have ever heard of is sixteen, but you… you're older than that. Why?\" Hansel snorted as he stood back up. \"Just lucky I guess.\" \"I doubt that. Your sister's not practiced enough to have done it, perhaps mother?\" \"Done what?\" Of all the times for Hansel to be caught off guard without a weapon, he'd never so desperately wanted to bash the end of his rifle into someone's head so much. The riddles and games were tedious and getting him nowhere. At least regular witches were transparent in their desire to kill you. \"Your magic has been suppressed and by someone rather powerful. Without this spell, I think you would have been Lamiae fodder long ago. It would also explain your belief that witch's magic doesn't work on either of you.\" The words sunk like led in Hansel's gut. The only other person who could have possibly had the power to do such a thing would have been their mother, the one person Hansel had spent years hating more than anyone else. He had hated her for abandoning them, for leaving them to the lives they would take up in their family's absence. Then Muriel had happened and that hatred had softened slightly. Hansel had spent his whole life looking out for Gretel and he could forgive their parents for sending them away in order to protect his sister, but he couldn't forgive their mother for the evil that followed in his veins. The potential of this revelation threatened to turn his whole world upside down and make a mockery of his beliefs. His hatred gave him strength, without it where would he be? The world had been black and white and in the wake of numerous revelations it was painted in far too many shades of gray for him to make heads or tails of. The hunter was snapped back to the present with a sharp jolt radiating up his arm. \"Seems like your magic's working rather well,\" protested Hansel, trying to shake the numbness out of his arm. Andrea's evil had worked on him too when so many others had failed because deep down inside, he wanted it to. Surely he didn't have some deep seeded desire to let Kaspar remove him from this world, did he? His anger was rising up, demanding to be released on Kaspar for everything he had done and everything others had inflicted upon Hansel. Kaspar chuckled, \"Hardly. My magic is very powerful. If something wasn't deflecting most of it, you'd be dead. Hansel's glare sharpened. \"You knew that before hand?\" The thought of some smug son of a bitch gambling with his life for their own general amusement was as off putting as Kaspar's ability to seemingly know everything. \"I suspected, and now I'm sure,\" he offered casually. \"You son of a bitch!\" Hansel could feel something swell up inside of him and instead of fighting it, stomping it back down to the depth of hell in which it was born, he just let go. The display of magic was unlike anything he's yet produced. While his aim was practically nonexistent, he still felt like he made his point, if only to the now smoldering remains of the former large pine tree. Over the rapid pounding of Hansel's heart, he could just make out the high pitched wails of the Lamiae in the distance as they fruitlessly tried to breach the barrier and acquire their prize, like a grizzly that finally got its first taste of human blood and hungered for more, magic was in the air. He could feel their hunger and desire too, like someone had told them their prize pig was ready for slaughter and a most bountiful meal was due. Where Hansel usually felt weak and spent, now he felt energized and alive. His hand tingled in anticipation as he experimentally rubbed his thumb across his fingers, leaving a magical oil slick in its wake. The pressure was back, begging to be released, demanding to be put on display and then freed into the world like the living thing it was and Hansel obliged. With a wicked smile he extended his hand toward Kaspar and reveled in the bright green flash that followed. Like many of the witches they young hunters had come across, his target seemed to possess lightning fast reflexes. Much to Hansel's dismay, his attempt missed the mark. A childish smile curved Kaspar's face, his eyes shining with the glee of a young boy enthralled in a riveting game of chance. He ducked past several more attempts to repay his unorthodox lesson for Hansel while delivering a few more shots of magical encouragement himself. After several failed to make contact with his intended target, Hansel found himself with his back against the side of the house, nowhere to go that would put him out of the way of Kaspar's next shot. As the ball of yellow energy accelerated towards him, Hansel raised his hands to try and absorb most of the shock and spare himself some of the impending pain. He screwed his eyes shut and clenched his jaw in anticipation but nothing happened. Hesitantly, he cracked on eye open and then the other, his jaw gaping slightly at what he saw. Floating before him like a giant bubble was a sphere of beautiful color. The yellows morphed into golds and oranges but remained in a perfect sphere shape outlined in electric green. His fingers twitched and the bubble flinched slightly, bending to his command. Hansel let out a shaky breath as he realized, he had done that, he was in control. Ever so slowly, Hansel reached out with one hand, his fingers brushing the delicate lining of the bubble. Applying a little more force to his touch, he pressed against the magical sphere. The light molded around the hunter's finger for a moment before it finally burst, letting loose like a bucket of water dumping. The light within splashed to the ground, painting it with a yellowish tinge. Applause echoed through the space which now seemed so miniscule and yet so vast to Hansel. His eyes flicked over to Kaspar, who seemed happy; the first real emotion the man had expressed besides indifference towards the hunters since their arrival. \"I knew you had it in you,\" commended Kaspar. \"Now you can really begin. Follow me.\" Hansel stood deathly still as Kaspar walked into the house. He felt lost at sea, unable to pin down any single emotion that was stirring within him. Parted of him wanted to run after the witch like a lost dog that had finally found its master, another part craved more, to learn more, discover more. The part that had made Hansel the man he was today hesitated at the threshold of the door. He considered his limited option for a moment, then ducking his head in shame, stepped inside the house. Kaspar struck a match against the rough grain of the work bench causing the tip to burst to life in a flash of light that quickly muted to a more stable level. The nearby candle coughed and sputtered it's acceptance of the fame, throwing enough of a glow to push the darkness back. As the flame lapped and licked at the wick the shadows cast on Kaspar's face highlighted the think black vines of magic that curled across his features. It was a sobering reminder of just who's company Hansel was keeping. In the exhilarating rush that had followed each burst of magical release the harsh lines of reality had melted away. This man was not his friend, this man was a witch who learned to keep the beast at bay. Sure he had offered to impart that wisdom upon the hunter, but he couldn't help but feel as though he was on the edge of a slippery slope and the fall would be treacherous if he slipped. \"Know that we've seen you're potential, we can explore it and then learn to control it,\" said Kaspar as he perused though a stack of dusty old books Finding the one he sought, he pushed the others off the table with a thud and began fervently flipping through the pages. \"Here,\" he exclaimed, practically shoving the book into Hansel's chest. The hunter to the book trusted at him, turning it around to read the script painted on the page. \"I don't even know what language these words are supposed to be,\" confessed Hansel. The few letters he could identify in the fancy scrawl didn't form any combination to any words he had picked up. While his vocabulary wasn't expansive by any means, he could always pick out something he recognized. \"It's an ancient tongue, you shouldn't recognize any of the words but say them anyways.\" Kaspar looked at Hansel expectantly. \"Um.\" Kaspar took pity on Hansel's bewildered look and read the passage out loud taking care with each word. The hunter dutifully repeated with only a few stumbles here and there. The words were few but the sounds unfamiliar enough that his tongue didn't curve around them with the same grace as Kaspar. The candles that adorned the small house ignited all at once and Hansel had to shut his eyes against the sudden change ambiance. It didn't take a genius to figure out what had happened. It wasn't prefaced with the same swell of pressure or warmth or the subsequent green light but he knew what or rather who had caused the candles to burst to life. The exhilaration and tingle still followed and Hansel let his eyes slide shut as he got lost in the feeling. It was warmth and safety while at the same time it felt like standing too close to the edge of a cliff, with the wind running its finger through his hair. It was the edge of a knife in which he could tumble back to safety or oblivion and he loved the feeling. \"Come let's try another one. We don't need grandiose displays to learn to temper your hand; simple children's spells should help you gain control.\" Excitement radiated off of Kaspar Hansel found his new found enthusiasm infectious almost as much as the feeling he got when he stopped trying to hold back what was so desperately dying to get out. One spell turned into two, turned into ten; the minutes to hours as time slipped by without notice. As Hansel collapsed into bed that evening, black book all but forgotten, the feeling that he had spent the whole day chasing lingered in every extremity and curled deep in his gut with belonging and longing. He felt complete and sated.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 The lone call of morning came far too early for Hansel. As the rooster announced the beginning of a new day, the hunter felt as though last night should have been far more thrilling than he remembered it being. There were no casks of ale, odes of bravery, or friendly bar maidens wandring around to justify the splitting headache and the aches that seemed to have aches, just a barren bedroom and a rumpled bed. He rubbed his head and squinted against the rays of light creeping in through the old battered shutters. It wasn't enough light to chase the shadows of night completely away and Hansel let out a curse as he stubbed his toe against one of the many discarded books strewn across the floor. Hopping on one foot he tumbled back into bed. Needing to illuminate the modest bedroom in order to traverse the cluttered floor, Hansel pawed at the side table hoping to find something to light the oil lamp sitting idly on the table. \"Son of a bitch,\" he mumbled, coming up empty. He wasn't prepared to deal with the day if everything was going to go wrong and he had to feel like this. Grabbing the pillow he dropped it over his face in a halfhearted attempt at suffocation. As he lay there weighing the pros and cons of actually attempting to navigate the carelessly discarded book minefield, he realized he had a solution to his problem. The words had seemed so foreign yesterday, yet today they felt like old friends. Upon completion of the few lines, the oil lamp ignited, alleviating the darkness in the space untouched by the rising sun. A small smile graced the hunter's face as he reveled in his accomplishment. Carefully, he stepped around the minefield of strewn books to head for the kitchen for something to drink, in the hopes of maybe dulling his raging headache. The house was still and quiet, Kaspar nowhere to be seen but the door to his room was still closed. Hansel fumbled with the knickknacks on the shelf, trying to find a cup before dipping it into the bucket of well water left from the day before. The lukewarm water quenched his parched throat and it occurred to him that the headache that had been so prominent when he woke, had completely disappeared. In fact, he felt terrific. It wasn't the euphoric feeling of yesterday, but it wasn't the 'too much ale the night before' feeling anymore either. What he was, was starving now. It had been a long time since Hansel felt that famished. It was a type of hunger that made itself known when they siblings were too consumed in the hunt to stop to eat for a few days or the hard days when work was hard to come by and their money reserves ran too low to stay in a town and game had made itself scarce. The odd part was he had eaten the night before, in fact, the pair had feasted on wine and pheasant that Kaspar had magically captured. He continued his rummaging through every possible cupboard in the kitchen area in search of something that would sate his hunger. The cupboards weren't bare but the jars, bottles and other vessels occupying the shelves contained questionable items that didn't look like they fell anywhere near the margins of what constituted food. \"Gretel better hurry up,\" Hansel muttered. She wasn't due until later that night, but if she showed up early and rescued him from his relentless hunger, he would gladly take on all the less favorable chores they performed on their travels for at least a month. Hansel flinched at a sudden and loud thud behind him. Turning sharply, muscles coiling tightly in anticipation of a fight, he glared at the intruder. Kaspar stood unfazed near the table. The hunter looked from him to the larger book he had so unceremoniously deposited on the table. \"Since you're up, I figured we could move on to something… more productive,\" explained the witch, gesturing to the book. \"Why not,\" sighed Hansel resigning himself to going with the flow. The sooner he gained control, the sooner he and Gretel could leave all this behind and get back to what they were good at and with any luck, put this whole magic thing behind them, never again to see the light of day. The successive pop of each vertebrae snapping back into place went unnoticed in the quiet of Kaspar's makeshift library as Hansel stretched and twisted to alleviate his stiffness. The pair had been pouring over a new set of books that Kaspar had pulled from the depths of the library, complete with an healthy layer of dust adorning each, and had engaged in testing Hansel's abilities to make the spells works for most of the morning. It seemed easier today than it had yesterday. Even the words seemed less foreign, both on the page and flowing over his tongue. Each new venture and every page turned took the sting out of what Hansel was doing. No one was getting hurt by what he was doing. Kaspar hadn't insisted they sacrifice and children or living creatures to fulfill any spell requirements. It was all seemingly harmless. It was that sentiment that directed Hansel's thoughts as he sat there alone, Kapsar having muttered some excuse to excuse himself for a moment. Mena had used her powers for good, to help Hansel even though she knew his feelings on witches, Mena, who he had misjudged in all aspects from the very beginning. Perhaps he had misjudged the fate that had befallen him. Gretel had used magic to fight witches and she was still the same sweet soul he had always known. Letting go and embracing what he had inherited from his mother, as long as he could control it might not be as horrific as he had imagined. Still there was a voice inside his head, growing smaller by the hour but relentless nonetheless, that screamed that he shouldn't be doing this at all, let alone so freely. It was muted by the euphoric rush that washed over him every time he gave into the ever increasing need to let his power free into the world. It was a rush, like hanging by a rope over a ravine, the intoxicating thrill of defying death while being precariously perched upon its sword. He could pull himself up or slip and plummet to his death; either way it would be momentarily exhilarating. \"Here,\" offered Kaspar, plopping a plate with something resembling meat wrapped in pasty in front of Hansel. \"Have some dinner.\" \"Dinner?\" questioned Hansel. \"When you walked out of here it was noon.\" Kaspar scrunched up his face. \"That was several hours ago.\" Confused, Hansel turned to peer through the small crack in the shutters over the window. The small stream of light that had curled its way in with the morning sun had since vanished, leaving the murky darkness of early evening in its wake. The hunter paused for a moment, wondering how time had seemed to escape him so easily and with a task that he normally abhorred and struggled with. More importantly, he wondered how he could have missed Gretel's return for keeping his nose glued in a book. This wasn't him; he was usually more focused on the things going on around him, a hazard and life saving skill developed from years of hunting things that could use any moment of distraction to their throats out. It should have bothered him that he didn't quite feel like himself but he couldn't place a finger on what was different either. Keeping his concern and little voice of concern to himself, he asked, \"Where's Gretel?\" He peered around Kaspar, trying to get a glimpse of his sister beyond the door. \"She's not back yet,\" corrected Kaspar. He sat down across the table to begin working on his own plate of deliciously smelling dinner. A moment of panic flared in Hansel. He tried to think of why that news was troubling, but anything that didn't involve his recent studies seemed to be blanketed with a thick layer of fog that his mind had trouble traversing. \"But,\" he protested ineloquently and gaping slightly while gesturing towards the plate of food,\" there wasn't… there's no food in the kitchen.\" It wasn't the point he wanted to make, wasn't the nagging dread burrowing deep in his gut but the point still stood. A devilish half smirk appeared on Kaspar's face as he snorted in derision. \"You'll never want for anything when you have mastered the mystery and art of magic.\" Hansel froze in his movement to grab the cutlery on his plate. He may have been more willing to embrace his magic as long as it created momentum towards controlling it, but both men knew he wasn't yet willing to partake in indulgent and apparent forms of personal gain. Rolling his eyes, Kaspar divulged, \"It's called baking. You mix ingredients in a bowl then put it in a pan and cook it in the oven. I hear you're familiar with ovens.\" \" Right ,\" mumbled Hansel, shoving in a huge mouthful of food. \"I had to produce something, your sister isn't going to make it back tonight.\" Before Hansel could swallow his bite and declare his intent at some fool hardy attempt to track Gretel down, Kaspar elaborated, \"A storm has been blowing in all afternoon. It hasn't hit here yet but I bet it did hit the village early enough that if Gretel was smart, she'd stay there for the night and make the journey tomorrow in better weather.\" It made sense. The siblings were no strangers to poor weather condition, often changing their plans to accommodate the worst Mother Nature had to offer. Another day wouldn't even be the longest the two had spent apart and Gretel was capable of looking after herself. \"She'll be here tomorrow then?\" \"I would imagine,\" confirmed Kaspar. He gestured to the book Hansel had gotten half way through. \"We should keep going.\" Hansel let out a long breath. He couldn't find a fault in Kaspar's logic, but there was something within him that demanded he toss the book aside, grab his coat and march down the mountain to meet Gretel. With every spell uttered and small magic conjured the nagging feeling began to die behind a rush of euphoric bliss.[Chapter 15] Hansel woke to a pins and needles feeling in his arm that was hanging awkwardly off of the bed that he had barely flopped onto before passing out the night before. His eyes had no sooner cracked open then he rolled over and promptly threw up. It was becoming an uncomfortably familiar pattern over the last seven days. Absently he flicked his wrist towards the open shutters to command them to shut out the harsh light of morning with the added benefit of not having to crawl out of bed. Life had taken on a tolerable numbness in which the days just floated by. Anything that didn't have to do with the witchcraft or the books Kaspar was always eager to dump in front of him and Hansel went along with it. Things were just better when he wasn't fighting against his destiny, hell he even felt better physically. He wasn't so far gone that he didn't have a vague sense of what was happening; the reassuring warmth that swept through him every time he embraced his inherited gifts just made it easier to accept, to embrace. The little foreboding voice, that had served him so well in the past, promised the path to ruin lay ahead, but the euphoric feelings that silenced the voice were addictive to stop. It didn't take long, but what was now a simple magical command to close the shutter was just enough to take the edge off and quiet the rolling of his stomach. His uncoordinated limbs had to work hard to roll him over so Hansel was lying on his back with a better view to contemplate actually getting up for the day. As the silence of early morning filled the room, leaving a soft buzz in his ears, there was something that Hansel felt he was forgetting, something so important it wouldn't allow him completely let go and enjoy the thrilling rush that came from the world he was slipping into. Perhaps it was some small kernel of his soul that couldn't let him enjoy his new found happiness. He still knew that witchcraft was wrong but it wasn't like he was one of the many monsters he had devoted his life to hunting down and eradicating. Innocent people weren't paying for his crimes, in fact, there didn't seem to be a victim of any sort in the harmless exercises he engaged in. He hadn't had any desire to seek out children and sacrifice them to some demonic god in exchange for favors; he could keep this in check. If Hansel worked hard enough and got his powers under his control, then he could leave Kaspar's hut on the mountain and rejoin the world to do as he wished. Leaving had been Hansel's goal the moment he first woke up in this bed and it was still the thing that pushed him to improve each day, but after mastering his craft and leaving this place was no longer the crystal clear vision it had once been. He was going to leave and after that… it was mostly a question mark hanging over his future. It had involved someone else, someone with a soft smile and steel determination. Every time Hansel tried to picture that person, tried to make out the features that seemed similar to his but slightly different, he only came up with a faceless ghost who refused to let him have peace. Sitting up and halfheartedly smoothing out his rumpled shirt, he pushed the thoughts aside. If the ghosts of the past wanted to be elusive, they could be buried with the rush of an exhilarating future. Whoever the woman in his memories was, if she was important enough to haunt him, surely she would be there to help him. \"What's this?\" asked Hansel holding up a particularly decorative vial. Most of the jars and vials Kaspar kept around the house were simple glass vessels filled with odd colors and unique smells that Hansel didn't want to ask to many questions about. There was one cupboard that Kaspar had kept under lock and key, which after the hunter had finally begun to delve into his birthright without hesitation, Kaspar had started to pull from. The vials were porcelain with hand painted designs adorning them. Hansel never considered himself someone who appreciated art in any of its forms, but these fell squarely in the beautiful category. This one was different still. Buried deep in the back behind the vial Kaspar had asked him to fetch, was a metallic black bottle with gold and jewels encrusted around the neck. Kaspar looked up from the book he was flipping through, in search of a spell Hansel absolutely must try. \"Not what I asked for.\" It felt heavy in Hansel's hand and the temptation to open it was surprisingly strong. Biting on his lip, he reluctantly put the mysterious bottle back in exchange for the one he was supposed to acquire. He moved back to the table, placing the white bottle in front of Kaspar. \"Yeah, but what is it?\" he insisted. Looking slightly annoyed, like a school master having to deal with a particularly unruly child, Kaspar didn't even look up from his book. \"It's a potion for removing magic and magical abilities from a person,\" he explained with no more concern or emotion as though he would at mentioning the weather. Hansel felt as though he had been gut punched and he was left speechless as his brain tried to make sense of what Kaspar had just divulged. \"Removes magic?\" \"Yes.\" Hansel stared blankly at Kapsar. Surely he had heard wrong. \"So if someone takes it, then they wouldn't have magical abilities anymore?\" \"Yes,\" confirmed Kaspar in a voice that failed to capture the revelation and betrayal Hansel was feeling at those words. \"So I could just take that and all of this would go away?\" The bite to Hansel's voice barely held back the rage that was beginning to burn. It was confusing. Part of him remembered not wanting any part of this and it flared with hatred for a man that he had never real trusted. Another part craved to continue what he was doing, to pursue it at all costs and thus was thankful an easy way out wasn't possible. \"Then why are we just starring at it?\" \"It comes with grave consequences.\" The warning was clear as was Kaspar's desire to not argue the point. \"Such as?\" pressed Hansel. Salvation was mere steps away and he needed to grab it with both hands before the fog of bliss removed all common sense within him. \"Far reaching consequences.\" With a skeptical look from the witch hunter, Kaspar asked, \"Is the threat of grave consequences not enough? Surely you're not that weak?\" Hansel countered, \"You're trying to goad me into something.\" \"Perhaps,\" he offered with a shrug. \"You must have some inner strength, after all, you hunt witches.\" \"No. I protect…\" The name was on the tip of his tongue but wouldn't come to him. The ghost remained elusive. \"Gretel,\" supplied Kaspar, noticing Hansel's pause. \" Gretel . No, I protect Gretel. Hunting witches is more her thing.\" The name was so familiar, he couldn't believe he had forgotten it. His sister was the reason he did everything, his one purpose in life and a couple of spells had clouded that. Pushed her out and taken her place and his devotion. He was drowning in a pit of tar and some broken and twisted part of him was alright with it. \"I think lying doesn't become you.\" \"She's into helping the helpless. If it was up to me, I'd say fuck them all. The only good witch is a dead witch.\" \"Undoubtedly. Taking what appears to be the easy way out is beneath you, otherwise you wouldn't have come this far. Trust me, this way may seem hard but it's far better than what will happen if show weakness and seal that deal with the devil,\" cautioned Kaspar. \"Because that isn't what I've done so far,\" retorted Hansel, pushing his chair back harshly before storming out of the room. The cabin door slammed shut in his wake as he headed beyond the tamed grounds of Kaspar's homestead for the wilds of the nearby forest. He moved with determination and speed, letting his anger push him further away from the house. He needed space, a calm place to think that wasn't going to offer the temptation of anything Kaspar had to offer. His head was spinning. Recognizing the gentle babbling brook as the furthest the hunter could safely go without forsaking the safety of Kaspar's magical boarders, Hansel flopped down in the tender moss. Crawling on his hands and knees towards the stream, he plunged his face into its chilly waters. The shock of the coldness cleared his head a little and thinned the fog that had been plaguing him. He came up coughing and sputtering, water running in rivets down his face. Wiping the water from his eyes, he caught sight of his wrist and his heart stopped. Breath seized in his lungs and for a moment it seemed like his body had forgot how to function. Disbelief drove his other hand to pull at his sleeve, yanking it as far back as the fabric would accommodate. His fingers raked over the skin, desperately trying to remove what he saw, to prove it was a mistake, a smudge of dirt, not vine like black lines curling up his arm exposing his dirty secret to the world. He plunged his wrist into the water, desperate to wash away what he knew deep down in the very pit of his being was the permanent and irrefutable evidence of the rotting of his soul. There was no denying it and no hiding it now, he had let himself fall. Shame washed over him as he stared down at the mark, deep and dark against his pale skin. As far as the usual witch disfigurement went, it was rather beautiful, not the distorted disfigurement associated with those the hunted. It was still hideous in what it represented and Hansel had done it to himself. He couldn't put the blame on his upbringing, abandonment or the inherited stain left upon him by his mother's lineage. He had brought this upon himself the moment he traded the cold metal of a bullet for hope at managing this. While the mark and subsequence fallout was his alone to bear, he knew Gretel would try and take responsibility for it or at the very least, try to talk him out of any solution he would devise for it. Hastily he ripped off a piece of fabric from his vest and wrapped it around his wrist concealing the evidence from the world but not his soul. Hansel hated magic, it had destroyed their lives, it was a plague, a curse and yet for some reason, it only took one push from Kaspar for him to open up and embrace the uses of it. He cursed his weakness for giving in so easily but he was damned if he did and damned if he didn't. It wasn't that long ago that he was willing to let the Lamiae finish what they started. Their mother who had abandoned them, even if she had her reasons, had left her stain upon Hansel, and though he would gladly bear its mark if it meant Gretel wouldn't have to. The world said male witches weren't meant to live and he was happy to oblige, for it would spare him the path he know found himself on. Now he had a taste for the very thing he hated and it was hard to let go. Hansel knew what he had to do. He'd let himself be blinded to the dangers, to everything that was truly important. Kaspar hadn't lied to his face, but the omission of facts had had the same impact, allowing Hansel to get lost in a world he had initially wanted no part of. Now Gretel was out there and Hansel didn't know if she was in trouble or not. Time had gotten away from him, clouded in the exhilarating rush that pushed everything real out of his mind. He needed to find her, but beyond the magical barrier lay the Lamiae, a foe he knew he couldn't beat with either witchcraft or his good old fashioned witch hunting skill. The only chance he had was evasion, but that was impossible with an enemy whose sole purpose was to both litteraly and ifuratively sniff someone like him out. There was also another problem, one so terrifying Hansel didn't want to admit it to himself. He felt great when he and Kaspar were testing and pushing his limits or even when he indulged in magic for his own benefit, but when he stopped, the need, the craving took over. It left him almost as bad as the moments he missed a dose of his medication. Even the few moments he was taking for himself now, he could feel it, the more he wanted to go crawling back and beg Kaspar to teach him something new, something that required a greater use of his abilities. Hansel made up his mind. His sister was more important, consequences be damned, whatever they were.[Chapter 16] Hansel waited for the cover of darkness to perpetrate the crime. Already his body was beginning to protest his complete lack of magical use. The headache that always lingered threateningly in the background had descended in full force, causing the world to wobble in its almost too brightness, despite the dim of the hour. It felt like he should have been recovering from the greatest night of drinking in his life or the worst tangling with a witch in recent memory. The contrast between the aching desperate need and blissful intoxicating numbness was almost enough to make him reconsider what he was about to do. Magic may have a hold on him, but he could control it enough not to slip completely under, couldn't he? Hansel had seen the book containing the spells to erect magical barriers, he could take it, run away to the middle of nowhere and set his own place up to practice as freely as he liked. He could indulge, and being away from anything and anyone would prevent him from falling off the magical cliff into human sacrifice and hunting children. It would be so easy to give in, to finally stop fighting what was inevitably in his nature. Hansel placed his hand against the wall to brace himself as a wave of nausea rolled over him. Whether it was a result of his pathetic and disturbing train of thought or the withdrawal of magic that seemed to relentlessly claw and scratch at him, making his skin itch and pull, he didn't know. His eye caught the smooth and shiny surface of the mirror on the wall. Through the cracks and dirt caked on its surface from years of neglect he managed to make out the haunting image taking up real-estate in its surface. He realized he no longer recognized the man in the mirror. The sad despondent soul staring back at him couldn't possibly be his. Swallowing back the bile, he shakily pushed off the wall and slowly put one foot in front of the other, careful to avoid the loose and squeaky floor boards that would shout out his secret to the world. It wasn't long before he found himself standing in front of the cabinet, doors pried open to reveal the contents within. Of all the bottles and vials clogging the shelves the sole onyx one stood out from the others. Its metallic nature caught the shafts of moonlight that dared to cut through the night. The sparkle of the jewels wrapped delicately around the bottle neck, were mesmerizing in their beauty and rarity. If not for the potential contents, Hansel could believe it was something that should adorn the shelves of royalty. Just holding it his hand felt like a violation against its beauty. The rough hands of a tramp seemed unworthy to hold it, let alone steal the contents from within, but still the young hunter pulled the wax sealed cork out with a pop. He raised the bottle to his lips and paused, the lip of the bottle hovering dangerously close to his mouth. His certainty wavered as Kaspar's words echoed through his memory. \"It comes with grave consequences.\" Hansel and Gretel had stood in the presence of many impressive foes and still beat the odds. They had tangled with the harbingers of hell and triumphed over all their magic, tricks and curses. How horrible could the consequences be to saving himself from such a dark fate? He knew the consequences if he didn't take it and even though he was well versed in hard to imagine things, he couldn't conjure anything that would be worse than not being able to save his sister. Taking a deep breath, Hansel tipped the bottle forward and swallowed the contents in one gulp. It was cold and smooth like swallowing a chip of ice. He stood there for a moment, waiting for some sign that the potion had worked. Nothing. He didn't know what he was expecting, what sign there could possibly be for destroying something so vile. There was a fleeting moment of panic, what if it hadn't worked, what if it was just the product of old wives' tales that turned into legend? The question was quickly answered as a wave of molten agony exploded from his center coating every nerve and muscle in his body. His legs buckled and he collapsed on the floor gasping for breath with lungs that refused to endure the pain. It was like being burned alive from the inside out, the irony which wouldn't have been lost on Hansel if he could focus on anything other than the pain. His limbs flailed uselessly in a desperate effort to find relief. Hansel might have been screaming but he wasn't sure, it was hard to hear anything over the pound of his heart. Something touched his shoulder, wrapping around his arm to turn him over onto this back. His natural instinct was to fight but he just didn't have it in him to mount any resistance. Hansel pried his eyes open to see Kaspar leaning over him, lips moving in a pattern that should mean something, but the hunter couldn't put it together. If he thought the pressure of his mystical abilities expanding and bursting to be released upon the world was painful, he had been sorely mistaken. Hansel's vision began to grey around the edges promising merciful death; he would take it greedily, with both hands if it meant an end to the agony. Just when he was sure the he reached his breaking point, that he couldn't take anymore, the haunting darkness that had been lurking at the edge of his vision melted into an electric purple that permeated everything, growing brighter and brighter until he had to shut his eyes against the light. The burning sensation slowly pulled back from his extremities, coiling in a tight ball in his center and just like a bubble that floated too high, it burst. Hansel cracked his eyelids open just in time to see a purple wave of light emanate from within him and spread out like a ripple in a pond. He laid there for a moment watching the as the ripple moved outwards in all directions, unopposed by anything in its path but leaving everything undisturbed. It continued to move out past the wall of the home where the hunter lost a direct line of sight with it but the eerie glow from outside the window proved the ripple wasn't going to stop. \"Do you have any idea what you've done?\" shouted Kaspar. Hansel had no words, he couldn't even move his tongue if he did conjure anything to say. The warning about consequences was well deserved, but it was over now and as long as it worked, that he didn't now have some vague impression of what it felt to be either burned alive or have one's flesh flayed from their bones for no reason, then he was fine with what transpired. \"You'll regret this. Those you care about will regret what you've done here,\" raged Kaspar, standing up abruptly and storming out of the room, leaving Hansel a quivering mess on the floor. Hansel pulled himself into a tight ball, trying to protect himself against the now phantom pain that still lingered. His mind raced with what ifs. Kaspar seemed to believe it had worked and if what Hansel had witnessed was any indication, then it had to have worked, but what if he hadn't purged the curse from his blood? He needed to know but the effort to try any sort of magical display seemed beyond him at the moment. His tongue darted over his horribly chapped lips as he tried to find enough spit to form words. He fought to pull in sufficient breath and mumbled the first thing that came to mind. His voice was practically no existent and he prayed it would still count. When the room remained unnervingly dark and no candles burst to life, Hansel cautiously held onto hope. It could have been a fluke, too weak to perform any unholy feats witchcraft. Hansel's fingers began to claw at the makeshift wrap he had tied around his wrist to his mark. He fumbled, but slowly his fingers began to follow his direction. Lifting the frayed edge of the wrap, he exposed a small snippet of his wrist's pale skin and his heart sunk. The black vines still curled and twisted around wrist, as bright as it had ever been. Dishearten, the hunter whispered every spell he had committed to memory; one after another, then repeating them all again and again. As the first rays of sunlight found their way through the cracks and glass, Hansel realized none of the spells had worked. Nothing had happened. He was free, regardless of the mark that marred his skin.[Chapter 17] The house was quiet and empty as Hansel pried himself off the floor. He tumbled over as he tried to get his uncooperative legs underneath himself. After several failed attempts he managed to pull himself up with the aid of the nearby table. Clutching the worn wood edge, the world tilted and swirled trying to defy the death grip the hunter had on the table. With the memory of the agony that burned itself into him a fading memory, Hansel felt remarkably better. The all encompassing need was gone. With determination he strode out of the room to gather what few belongings he had with him; he had a sister to track down. There was no sign of Kaspar anywhere and Hansel had no clue as to where he stormed off to, but it didn't matter. There was nothing he could offer the man now and nothing he required of his odd host anymore. Kaspar's absence tickled the back of the hunter's mind as something that should garner more thought but Gretel already had a head start on him. He hastily shoved his change of clothes and spare ammunition in his sack. He pilfered a blanket out of the wardrobe, and while theft wasn't the sibling's first choice for acquisition, Hansel's current situation left little recourse if he wanted to survive the elements. That led to a stop in the kitchen as well. Hansel wasn't greedy, taking a small loaf of bread and a chicken leg to not diminish Kaspar's supply. He wasn't a fan of the man or his methods, but Kaspar had put him up and in a strange and unique way, helped the hunter. Tying the top of his sack closed, Hansel's eyes drifted to the door to Kaspar's study. So much had happened within those walls, the small room was practically bursting with memories, most of which Hansel would give anything to forget. Still the hunter was the consummate student and wasn't going to leave an advantage lying around. As a small boy, Hansel had attended school and for the most part the only thing he remembered about the experience was being abruptly pulled out of the small one room school house to take his studies at home. He had protested the action, his mother's strong grip firmly around his wrist dragging him from the school house and the only other children beside Gretel that he had ever known. Their mother had taken up the sibling's lessons making time for them between their chores. Any mention of the siblings' removal from the nearby town's school house was done with hushed whispers that ended with remorseful eyes falling on Hansel. Gretel had flourished under their mother's tutelage often reinforcing the lesson for Hansel at night long after their parents had tucked them into bed. While he was slow to pick things up, the important life lesson that had been thrust upon him, always stuck. Wrapping several bottles tightly in any rag he could find, Hansel stuffed them deep into his sac. No longer needing anything the small cottage on the mountain top could offer, he set on his lonely journey back down towards Gretel's last know whereabouts. The early morning twilight bled the soft purples of night with the beginning rays of morning; promising another day of life to the rustic colored leaves that had curled and huddled in anticipation of their coming wintery demise. The village, if it was even big enough to qualify for that small title, was as sleepy as the vast tracks of farm land that lay fallow. The tiny community nestled in the shadow of the mountain looked to have everything required to support the inhabitants without the constant bustle of well traveled trade routes. Hansel pulled his jacket collar higher to ward off the early chill of impending winter as he traipsed across the fields; the billowing chimney's of the small collection of cottages his guiding star. The only souls brave enough to be outside with Hansel were the cows huddled together in fields. The sweet smell of baked goods drifted down the worn path that was passing for village's main road. Believing it a good a place as any to start, Hansel pushed open the weathered wooden door to the only building displaying sellable wears in the windows. \"Morning to you,\" chirped a young girl, no more than twelve years of age, carrying a tray of fresh rolls over to a basket sitting on the counter. \"Felizitas!\" ordered a large man with a blood stained apron, emerging from the back. \"Go help your mother with the butter.\" The girl dipped her head giving Hansel an apologetic look before acknowledging the man. \"Right away father,\" she mumbled before gracefully fluttering out of the room. The father, large butcher knife in hand, waddled behind the counter depositing the knife with a large thud as it sank into the chopping block. Never taking his eyes off of Hansel, he haphazardly wiped the evidence of his morning's work onto a discarded rag. \"What can I do for you stranger?\" barked the man. There was tension in the air as the man scrutinized every inch of Hansel. \"I'm looking for someone, maybe you could help me,\" started the hunter. \"We don't need any more trouble around here,\" interrupted the man, folding his arms defiantly across his chest. \"Any more?\" asked Hansel. \"What trouble was there to start with?\" \"The kind we don't need strangers sticking their noses in, now leave!\" The order was emphasized with a large meaty finger pointing towards the door. \"Please, I'm looking for my sister Gretel and if there was trouble, I'm sure she went out of her way to get involved,\" countered Hansel, raising his hands in a nonthreatening gesture. \"No! Turn around and leave,\" ordered the man, hand wrapping around the handle of the butcher knife to pry it from the block. Hansel began to take a step back. Normally common villagers weren't a threat but this guy was a human sized Edward and the hunter wasn't exactly at his best. \"You're Hansel.\" Felizitas poked her head from around the corner. \"Gretel said you would come.\" The large butcher stopped in front of the counter, keeping himself closer to the stranger in their midst. \"Felizitas, go back outside with your mother.\" \"But father, he can help Gretel. She said he would help,\" pleaded the young girl. \"I have to find my sister. Tell me what happened.\" Hansel tried to keep the frustration out of his voice and invoke a tone of helpless need that might garner him the kindness of strangers. The girl looked desperately at her father. \" Please. If they can really help Verena, shouldn't we let them?\" Tears threatened to spill down her pale cheeks. The butcher rolled the knife handle in his huge palm, shifting its weight back and forth. His gaze flicked between the young girl and back to Hansel several times before he slammed the knife back in the block with a huff. He left the small shop without a word but the glare he shot Hansel said more than words ever could. It was quite possibly the scariest threat Hansel had ever received. Not wanting to squander his opportunity, Hansel asked, \"Gretel was here?\" \"Yes,\" assured Felizitas. \"She came to our village almost two weeks ago.\" \"Two weeks?\" Hansel rolled the words around his mouth trying to make them seem real. Surely he had miss heard; Gretel had just left, hadn't she. Felizitas nodded enthusiastically. \"Yes, that right. Two weeks ago just before the storm.\" Gretel let out a weary sigh as the never ending wall of forest and rock finally gave way to the flat farmland surrounding the quaint village. She was exhausted after the long day's journey and looking forward to getting a good night's sleep. Hopefully someone would be able to provide her with a room for the night before loading up the wagon in the morning. Just thinking about the uphill half of her journey was exhausting. Villagers offered her half glances as she got closer to the buildings but no one seemed concerned enough to stop what they were doing. She headed to the building that seemed the focal point of the comings and goings in the town, tying the mule o the hitching post out front. The aroma of a hearty stew danced around the large room that seemed to double as both the general store and the tavern. \"Can I get you anything?\" chirped a bubbly little girl from behind the counter. Gretel offered a warm smile in return. \"Yes, I'm looking to procure some supplies.\" She slid the list Kaspar had written out towards the young girl who nodded as she read each of the items. The girl's smile vanished as she reached the bottom of the list. \"Just a moment.\" She excused herself before darting towards the back room. Gretel tried to keep her uneasiness in check. Kaspar had claimed to have done business here on a regular basis and she wouldn't receive any trouble with any of the villagers. For first appearances they seemed like a group of quiet townsfolk, certainly nothing she wouldn't be able to handle if push came to shove. Gretel had to reevaluate her last thought as an impressively larger man came towards the counter, supply list in his hefty mitt. \"This is your list?\" grumbled the large man. Gretel licked her lip, suddenly feeling very alone. \"It is,\" she said firmly. \"Kaspar said you sell to him, unfortunately he wasn't able to come himself.\" She reached into her pocket and pulled out a handful of folded currency notes. The large man looked Gretel up and down and then back to the worn stack of money on the counter. \"He sent you?\" \"Yes.\" Pocketing the money, he gestured to the young girl from earlier and another little girl that had joined the first. \"Felizitas and Verena will show you where everything is in the morning but you'll have to load it all yourself.\" \"That's fine,\" answered Gretel firmly, leaving no room for any notion that she wasn't up to the task. \"Is there a room available for tonight?\" she added, pulling out another note and displaying it tightly in her hand. \"Felizitas, find our guest a place to stay,\" commanded the large man, leaving the two girls alone with Gretel. \"Yes father,\" responded Felizitas. \"Would you like a bowl of stew before we take you up to the loft?\" she asked Gretel. Gretel pulled the last rope hard to remove any slack before tying it securely to the cart. Leaning back against the load she let out a deep sigh. Even with the two young girls helping her as best they could, the large sacks and barrels still took a fair bit of effort load. She had forgotten just how much work some things were since they had Edward doing all the heavy lifting for the hunters. \"You should really wait,\" whispered Verena, shyly scuffing her shoe in the dirt laden hay. \"Storm's coming in. It's going to be a bad one.\" Gretel turned to look out the open door of the barn. The sun was still shining, doing its best to warm the earth but grey clouds were hanging threateningly in the distance. There was a chance it could change direction or that she could even reach Kaspar's cottage before the worst of it reached the mountain. \"She's right you know,\" confirmed Felizitas. \"You should give some consideration to staying to staying the night. Kaspar says the trails get quite dangerous when the weather gets bad.\" \"You know Kaspar?\" The thought of Kaspar interacting with anyone, let alone a child, in a manner in which they would speak his name fondly, was hard to comprehend. \"He gets all of his supplies here, in exchange he does wonderful things for the village.\" Gretel's next question died on her tongue as the raised voices in the makeshift town square drifted towards the barn. Slinking towards the barn door, she peered around the edge to inconspicuously observe what the commotion was about. The villagers were gathered together on one side of the square while five figures stood on the opposite side. It wasn't the best angle to see or spot to listen from but there was no mistaking who had arrived in the town. The sunlight picked up the more purple hues in the Lamiae's skin unlike the moonlight which gave then a hauntingly silver tone. Four of them stood in a rigid square with the fifth one in the middle. It was the fifth that was addressing the villagers in an eloquent voice that was softer than any other Gretel had heard from the enemy before, even if it still carried their authoritative arrogance. It wasn't the only thing different about the apparent leader of the group. Her clothing had an autocratic flow unlike the tighter and more combat appropriate wardrobe of the other, and silver horns that curled up on her head to form a crown like crest. \"They're not supposed to be here,\" whispered Verena, clinging tightly to Gretel's leg. The familiarity in which the children gazed upon the intruders gave Gretel pause. There was a wariness unlike the all out fear that usually happened when someone so young and innocent lay eyes upon evil incarnate. Even the adults demonstrated reservation more so than first time fear. Trying to play catch up, Gretel remained tucked away, straining to hear any clues she could. \"What do you want?\" demanded the town blacksmith. \"Our agreement forbids you from venturing here.\" \"Our deal?\" hissed the crowned Lamiae. \"It's only a deal if it's honored and we find you lacking. But fear not, I have conceived away for you to be useful once again.\" Her eyes narrowed dangerously on the children tucked into their parents' embrace within the crowd. \"You cannot have the children,\" protested the blacksmith. \"I can have whatever I desire,\" snapped the queen Lamiae. The men of the village tightened their grips on farm implements turned weapons, raising them in preparation. The queen raised no weapons only here voice. It started out as a hummed melody before turning into a song reminiscent of the most saintly choir. It was unlike anything Gretel had ever heard, both in its beauty and its use. Spells had a certain rhythmic quality but they were never sung like a tender love song. It quickly became apparent the song packed the same punch as any well crafted spell. The villagers, misguidedly prepared to defend themselves against an evil that made Gretel tremble, were stiff like statues. Their expression conveyed a desperate need to move to protect the young girls the warrior Lamiae were plucking from their grasp, but none could move a muscle. Gretel turned to the two girls in her company, kneeling down before the youngest and placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Stay here and stay out of sight.\" \"What are you going to do?\" asked Verena. \"This is what my brother and I do. We save children from monsters.\" The odds weren't in her favor and Gretel lacked anything to fight such a formidable enemy but she couldn't stand by and do nothing. Her own family had been torn apart by the evils of the world; she couldn't stand by and watch it happen to anyone else. \"Where is he?\" asked Verena. \"Hansel? He's coming, he'll be here to help, don't you worry. Now stay out of sight and everything will be alright,\" promised Gretel, transferring Verena's tight grip to her sister. Taking a deep breath to steel her nerves, Gretel stepped out from the barn. The Lamiae stopped in their tracks, surprised at the sudden movement. The queen's eyes landed on Gretel and a feral smile put all over her sharp teeth on display. \"What do we have here?\" she snarled, her mystical song having no effect on the challenger. \"I'm not going to let you take these girls,\" countered Gretel, with all the fake bravado she could muster. In a flash, the queen was standing in front of Gretel, her chest pressed against the hunter's forcing her to take a step back. \"I've never encountered someone immune to my charms before,\" she cooed, words dripping with curiosity. \"It's pretty normal in my world,\" snapped Gretel, throwing a vicious right hook that firmly found its mark. The queen's head snapped with the blow but quickly snapped back to look at the hunter. \"We're going to have fun with you.\" Before Gretel could land another blow, she felt something slam into her from behind knocking her to the ground. Soon all four of the warrior Lamiae were on top of her providing her with many opportunities to kick, bite and scratch but it wasn't enough to fend them off. The world faded to grey and to nothingness. With Gretel slung limply over one Lamiae's shoulder and several children in hand, the warrior Lamiae disappeared into the coming storm. The queen looked on at her captive audience, pacing back and forth in front of them. \"I think such bravery should be rewarded, don't you?\" The Lamiae placed her palms together moving them back and forth in a slow caress. A red ball appeared, fluid like water, splitting into two balls. They hovered over her palm before flying like a humming bird straight into two of the villagers, disappearing into their skin. Verena's sudden scream pulled the queen's attention towards the barn. Before either girl could blink, the silver nightmare was standing before them with a blood curdling smile. \"I think you're just what I'm looking for little one.\"[Chapter 18] \"The people she infected with those red orbs are going to die,\" informed Felizitas with a sincerity and conviction no one that young should know. \"It's happened before, a long time ago. After a month they start to get very sick and then they just die. None of the healers could do anything about it.\" Hansel didn't know anything about this new addition to the Lamiae's power arsenal, but he was aware of some of the truly despicable capabilities of spells. His line of work focused on the prevention of magical curses, rather than the remedy, but it still didn't make the helplessness abate. \"So can you save Verena? Can you help like Gretel said?\" This was why he let Gretel deal with the children. His brashness and non parental instincts were ill placed with such young people and he always seemed to fall victim to the wide hopeful eyes of young girls who needed to be saved. The words were leaving his lips before he could stop them. \"I promise.\" It was absurd to make such a promise. He would do his damnedest to rescue the children and more importantly his sister, but given the foe, he wasn't sure it was an accomplishable task. \"I will bring your sister back safely.\" Felizitas face lit up with salvation and delight, unaware of the severity of the lie Hansel had just cast. \"Thank you,\" she said, relief evident in her voice. Hansel could imagine what the young girl was going through, watching her sister taken away into the unknown by the scariest of monsters. It was something Hansel had to endure a time or two before; it was a fear that haunted his nightmares. There was always some small, minuscule, inconceivable chance he could pull this off. And if he did fail, he wouldn't be alive to see that disappointment destroy the sunshine that just lit up her face. \"I'm going to need a few things first.\" It wasn't his gun, but it felt familiar and safe all the same. Normally, Hansel would have been more prepared and stocked for whatever might be thrown his way, but the village had supplied him as best they could, more importantly, they gave him a rifle and ammunition. The Lamiae had a large head start and an uncanny ability to hide their trail, but they weren't prepared for Hansel's unnerving attention to detail. There were just enough little clues that Hansel was pretty certain he was going the right way. It felt like old times again; the sweet smell of forest all around, a loaded weapon on his shoulder with a destination of certain death. For the misery it brought, there was nothing like the life he had, and going down swinging sure beat old a forgotten. While it felt like the good old days, Hansel couldn't help but keep one eye over his shoulder. The last time he was out in the world, the Lamiae had been ruthlessly hunting him and Gretel, running them both ragged. It was difficult to shake the feeling that it wouldn't happen again, except it couldn't; the magic that allowed them to home in on Hansel like a blood hound on a fox, was gone. The tension and fear that had come with it remained, as did the desire to use. The feeling of control and power that came with embracing his powers had been intoxicating and unlike anything he had experienced before. It would have had to have been to push his utter reluctance and hatred of witchcraft out of mind the way it had. Hansel still hated magic, more importantly, he hated what it had done to him but there was still some small sliver that craved to be a part of it again. This test would be more than just getting Gretel back, this would be the moment he decided if he could rise above all of his short comings, both inherited and learned. This would be the moment that defined is he was stronger than his destiny or just another cog in the machine of life. As he made camp and put another day between him and what had transpired on the floor of Kaspar's cottage, he felt a little more sure footed. Hansel's feet were already beginning to ache by the time the sun broke over the mountain. It was risky to start hunting at such a dark hour but sleep was too elusive to hold onto for long. The forest was wet with the morning mist and as silent as the dead; the morning chill as cool as the cold steel the hunter gripped tightly in his hands. His nerves were on high alert with the hairs on the back of his neck rising in anticipation. His left hand fell from his rifle to the knife fastened to his belt. Years of experience had instilled the instinct to wait for the right moment to strike, to let the enemy make the first move. He was not disappointed. In a flash of silver and purple he felt one of the creatures move past him. As quickly as it appeared, it disappeared into the safety of the forest cover. The steady pitter-patter of the blood droplets falling from Hansel's blade were the only sign that the creature had even made an appearance. Satisfaction forced a smile on his face. No longer on the defensive, he could see just what these foul beasts were made of. The betrayal of a snapping twig to his left pulled his attention and his rifle. He thrummed with familiar excitement as each shot rang out until the telltale screech of a bullet finding home. The wounded Lamiae wasn't going to go down quietly, spring out of the bushes, claws out and tearing through Hansel's flesh. The tug of torn flesh across his back caused him to stagger back, his finger sliding off the trigger. His opponent was just as lightening fast as he remembered but without the bone weary exhaustion of running for his life, the task of taking her out didn't seem as impossible. The Lamiae sprang up, digging her fingers into his shoulders while wrapping her legs tight around his waist. The weight of the beast and the momentum in which she threw herself at him sent both of them tumbling to the ground. She bit and scratched like an angry wolverine, refusing to let go of the prey pinned beneath her. Straining tense muscles, Hansel managed to twist, shifting the Lamiae underneath him. Now in the top position, he slammed his fist into her face repeatedly. The upper hand didn't last long as the pair began to tumble over one another, constantly changing who had the dominate position in an equally violent and bloody struggle. They finally came to a rest, Hansel's blade buried deep in the Lamiae's gut. He laid there, chest heaving under the weight of a body that would fight no more as warm blood crept along the cool metal and curled around his wrist. Though it was just his imagination, it burned as it soaked into the bandage hiding his mark from the world. His victory didn't last long. As quick and as silent as the Lamiae were, their speed betrayed them as leaves whispered their movements. Hansel could hear he was surrounded long before he saw their formidable features. They stood there, in a loose circle surrounding him; heads cocked in confidence, like a cat deciding how best to eat a mouse. \"Well what do we have here?\" demanded one of the Lamiae, her silver, crown like horns sparkling in the early morning light. She boldly stepped toward the hunter, mindless of the blood glistening blade clutched tightly in his hand. Hansel stared back defiantly, blood in his smile. If he was going down, he was taking the bitch with him. He just had to wait for the opportune moment to strike. The queen leaned in close, taking a deep breath and sucking in his scent. She followed the line of his neck down to his shoulder before pulling back. The disappointment was evident in her face; the prize had been lost. \"What have you done?\" she asked, already knowing what actions had transpired to rob her of the glory that would have been sucking Hansel dry. Hansel's wrist twitched in anticipation and his muscles coiled in preparation to strike. The queen's hand clamped down hard on his wrist before he even raised the blade past his waist. His face contorted in the pain that his voice refused to acknowledge. Tighter she squeezed, never shifting her eyes from his, and then, she began to hum. Hansel let his anger fester. First at the fact that such monsters roamed the earth, bringing misery to all those who lay eyes on them and then at the fact that she would waste his time with cheap parlor tricks that never worked on the siblings. Except, maybe things really had changed since drinking Kaspar's potion, because suddenly Hansel found himself unable to move. It was just like Felizitas had described, only to experience it first hand was terrifying. Hansel always had the ability to fight if he just dug down deep enough, there was always that last reserve he could pull from to fight for one more inch. He couldn't move at all, he was completely at her mercy and she would show none. Slowly, one by one, the queen pulled back Hansel's fingers and relieved him of his knife. She tossed it to the side like a stray loose thread, formerly inconvenient but now a forgotten memory. She pressed her lips against his ear and in a sing song voice, whispered, \"No more magic to protect you.\" A sharp pain exploded in the back of his head before everything went black.[Chapter 19] \"Hansel.\" Silence. A little louder, \"Hansel.\" \"Mmmmm.\" Hansel's head lolled to the side as the great debate to open his eyes waged in his head. \" Hansel!\" hissed Gretel, pulling her legs back as best she could in the small space of her confinement to kick the joining wall of their cages. Hansel flinched, eyes snapping open as he tensed for the coming threat. Blearily he glanced around his tiny dark world framed with wooden bars chopping up his view. He paused and lingered on Gretel as her soft smile filled him with gentle warmth. Her hair was a mess, dirt and dried blood caking the soft lines of her face, but the light of her smile was hard to diminish. His hand drifted towards the confines of his cage, testing the materials that were locking him in. As far as cages went, it was well crafted, the smooth bars unwilling to budge even an inch. They weren't going to be breaking through them with sheer strength and long gone were the days that they might be able to slip between the bars. Slowly, Hansel pulled himself into a sitting position, mindful of the low ceiling and very aware of every bruise and scratch he had earned on his journey to this place. \"Just like old times,\" he sighed, fingers snaking their way past the bars to entwine with Gretel's. She huffed a small laugh; the universe a little less scary now that the other half of her world was in sight. \"At least you came. Better late than never I suppose.\" She gripped his hand tightly, the closest to a hug they were going to get at the moment. It had never crossed her mind that he wouldn't do everything on his power to come, even as the days drew on. If there was life in his body, Hansel would come and if he never showed, Gretel knew it wouldn't be of his choosing. Whatever fate befell her after that would be far more welcomed than a life without her brother. They only had each other in this world and one would never leave the other behind. She studied him, tracing every line she knew so well and every new testament to the hell her brother had been through recently. There was a bone weary tiredness that had settled beneath his skin, tinged with a new shade of self-loathing that he was so quick to grab a hold of. Hansel protected her from the world as best he could, like he was making up for the shortcomings of their parents. If often caused him to do things he hated, things that blackened his soul so they wouldn't touch Gretel. She always found out, but out of respect for the sacrifices Hansel was so willing to make, she held her tongue. He was hiding something now. \"They took some of the girls from the village,\" Gretel reported, falling into the familiar role of business first and piecing Hansel together later. \"I heard. They cursed the villagers that tried to stop them, it was… effective.\" People died all the time, it was a fact of life. In their world, people died horribly; there was only so much they could do but sometimes it pierced the hard outer shells the siblings encased themselves in. Sometimes the misery of the world became too much and they could do nothing but feel for the people they were unable to protect. They shared a moment of silence, each slotting the carnage into the box of 'cost of doing business' in their minds. \"They're doing something to the girls. They're not eating them or using them for magic, rather they're doing magic on them.\" The words sent a shiver down her own spine as she thought about the peculiar behavior she had witnessed, locked away in her tiny cage. The glimpses she caught between the bars, and the screams that pierced the night, were the stuff her nightmares were founded on. \"There are others, other girls from different towns…\" The ones taken from the village had been young, probably younger than she and Hansel had been when they happened upon the candy house of torment. She hadn't seen those children since waking up in her cell, the unfortunate souls she had laid eyes upon had been slightly older; the images forever seared into her brain. The older children wandered around in a daze, lead on a leash like farm animals to their slaughter by the Lamiae; obedient puppets waiting for their masters' bidding. The real horror were the patches of silver that marred the girls' skin, spread out like a rash or infection of a gangrenous wound. \"I think they're changing the girls into Lamiae.\" Black magic consumed witches, rotted them from the inside out, but it was a choice made by the user. The witch chose to walk down the dark path of the black arts, any and all side effects were just collateral damage, but these girls hadn't chosen this. It was being thrust upon them, changing them from the inside out until there were only the monsters the Lamiae created; children sentenced to a living death. Gretel's voice filled with sincere determination. \"We have to stop them Hansel.\" Hansel looked around his cage nestled in the thick of the Lamiae nest. He didn't disagree with his sister's assessment but his first priority in their daunting situation was getting Gretel to safety. \"How do you propose we do that?\" Gretel slid closer to Hansel, her voice dropping to a whisper, \"They leave at night, most of them. They take the girls and they don't come back till dawn. The numbers will be more in our favor.\" He tapped the wooden bar with his foot. \"Doesn't matter if we have the numbers or not, if we can't get out of here.\" \"I've been thinking about that.\" She had been relieved of any weapons both actual and possible before she had woken up in her cage and hadn't been able to acquire anything useful in the days that followed. \"I'm hoping you have something useful in your repertoire for a magical assist.\" \"Gretel…\" The word hung in the air, a silent apology. It was a request for forgiveness, for being too weak to master his gifts, for not being strong enough to keep them when their value could produce their freedom. She held his gaze, trying to navigate the stormy grey of his eyes to find the secrets buried within them. The sinking feeling that started in her gut spilled out onto the floor, threatening to steal the floor out from beneath her. She had left her most prized possession in the hand of a man she barely knew, knowing that it was Hansel's only chance to get his powers under control. Really looking at him now in the muted glow of torch light, he didn't look like a man that had a gift under control; he looked remorseful, like he had somehow personally failed her. Her heart started to pound as her brain tried to reconcile the facts as she knew them. Hansel was a danger to himself and those around him if his abilities were left unchecked. Kapsar had promised to help him with that, offering safety until Hansel demonstrated control yet here her brother was, looking anything but a master of his heritage. \"Hansel, what happened?\" She was hesitant to ask, afraid of one more chip against them. \"Gretel, I tried… I…\" The words got caught behind the lump in his throat as her fingers slipped from his to dance up his hand on their path to his shoulder when they stopped abruptly at the tattered remains of the cloth he had tied around his wrist. He desperately wanted to pull his hand back as she began to unwrap the fabric but she needed to see the monster he had become, even if he couldn't bear to see the disappointment in her eyes. The cloth slipped off his wrist as easily as it went on, no longer strong enough to contain the lie Hansel was trying to perpetrate. For a moment he forgot how to breathe, his eyes cast down unable to watch disappoint over take his sister's smile. Her hand hovered over the mark for a moment before swiping over the skin. Harder and harder she rubbed, trying to remove the stain but it refused to budge. \"What did you do?\" she demanded, fear and anger putting more of a bite in her words. Before he could answer the door to his cage was forcibly removed and rough hands wrapped around him yanking him from his captivity. Gretel could only look on in horror as two warriors latched onto his arms holding him securely in place in front of their queen. The queen's head dipped in close to his neck as she took a long whiff of the exposed skin, switching to her sense of taste as her chin reached his jaw line. Her tongue slithered from his chin to his ear as she reassured herself of her earlier findings. Hansel struggled in the tight grip of his captors trying to put any sort of distance between him and the lead Lamiae, but their claws refused to allow him to move and inch. \"So it's not a trick,\" the queen hissed, her fingers seductively making their way from the top of his head to his chest. \"I had been promised the feast of a lifetime and now I find you severely wanting. You're just another mongrel now, a deliciously handsome one, but useless to me none the less.\" \"My queen,\" interrupted a Lamiae walking into the room. She bowed her head in submission upon standing before her queen. Raising it, brought her features under the full scrutiny of the flickering torch, giving Hansel a very clear and up close encounter with what Gretel had been talking about. This wasn't a Lamiae standing before but a teenage girl, her skin a patchwork of silver, like the scales on a snake. Her hands were gnarled with the razor sharp claws of the Lamiae erupting from her fingers, while one eye was swollen and oozing as swirls of purple wormed their way through the white parts of her eye. The queen snarled but didn't shift her piercing eyes off of the hunter. \"Kaspar wishes to speak with you.\" A twisted grin carved through the menacing marble of the queen's face as her eyes danced with delight. \"All of my problems and disappointments in one place. Bring him and her,\" she ordered, turning to Gretel left forgotten in her cage. \"I could use some entertainment this evening to make up for what has been denied to me.\" The queen stalked out of the room, her warriors obediently following with the siblings firmly in their grasps.[Chapter 20] \"We had a deal!\" raged Kaspar the second the queen came into view. The hall was carved out of stone, a representation of the Lamiae's sheer strength and resilients; a vast room of intimidation, not unlike the queen herself. Her look was of disenchantment as she took the only seat in the large cavern. Settling upon her throne, Hansel and Gretel were forced to kneel off to the side, their guards maintaining their iron tight hold. \"Yes we did,\" she replied coolly, \"and you failed to deliver.\" \"We've never had a timeline before. I'll find you someone else,\" retorted Kaspar, ripples of panic fraying the edges of his words. \"I'm tired of waiting and this one has cost me a lot of resources, which brings me to why I had to replenish our numbers.\" \"You can take girls from anywhere, our agreement was you'd leave my village alone. I'll find you someone else.\" Desperation was written on Kaspar's face, almost enough for Gretel to feel a tiny bit of sympathy towards the man if his betrayal wasn't becoming so apparent. The queen leaned forward, placing extra emphasis on each word. \"Your pet project was instrumental in lowering my numbers. I needed to replenish and your little village was the closest one and just ripe for the picking.\" \"I've supplied your sisters with enough magical boys over the years, I've earned the safety of that village!\" The corner of his eye twitched with anger and Hansel had to give credit for the balls Kapsar had to have to be so brazen in front of such a creature in her own territory. He was well seasoned in dealing with the weird and magical, and the Lamiae had given both him and his sister a good, hard run for their money. Hansel couldn't say he was surprised by this turn of events; he considered Kaspar shifty to begin with and no one ever did anything for nothing. Generosity wasn't something he's encountered in his life of chasing impossible things, there were always strings. Still, it was hard to ignore the disappointment radiating off of Gretel. Despite the evils of the world, she still had faith that there was decency in the world. He made a mental note to extend Kaspar's beating to make up for any heartache Gretel was feeling as a result of the man's betrayal. \"Then let this be a lesson in the price of failure and motivation for future success. I suggest you make yourself useful and find me someone worthy or I'll lay waste to the entire village and dine on you. \" Her teeth glistened with the sincerity of the threat and the Lamiae lining the room promised to succeed should the queen fail in that threat. Kaspar shrunk back, adopting and more submissive stance. Everything he had worked so hard to protect was teetering on the edge. His own mother had conceded to council law and agreed to drown him at the tender age of five when he first presented his inherited abilities. There standing in the stream with her hands firmly pressed on his shoulders, she had a change of heart or rather a lapse in judgment. Told to run and never stop for fear of imminent death, he ran, ran until there nothing left and his small body collapsed from exhaustion at the base of the mountain. It seemed nature was going to finish what his mother couldn't as night set in and the wolves began to howl but an old farmer and his wife happened upon the weak boy. They cleaned him up and fed him in their village, the one place Kaspar would grow to call home and protect at all costs. When the Lamiae finally caught up to him, sensing his magic from that far reaches of their territory, the villagers defended him. The old lady brought him up the mountain while the village distracted the Lamiae, and though it cost them dearly, and the life of the old lady's husband, she swore she didn't regret saving him. To ensure the future safety of all, the old woman sought out a local gypsy in search of something that could conceal the boy. She gave her life to get Kaspar to the gypsy woman who offered him a potion to remove all magic from his being, but at a price. The answer seemed obvious, but the more he thought about it, the more he couldn't let the sacrifices to protect him be in vain. Opting to keep his powers, he vowed to use them to protect the village and the people who had embraced him as one of their own. He had devoted his life to that promise and now it was threatening to be taken away, and all because he had a moment of weakness. And yet, glancing at the hunters kneeling in forced submission, he didn't want to let go of what he tried to obtain. He had given so much of his life to protect the village, it was hard not to want either and companion or a replacement. The tenuous balance he had struck with the queen had seen him deliver any boys displaying magical powers that he could track down; strangers sacrificed for the innocent lives of the villagers. Kaspar wasn't a fool, he studied his craft until he was sure he could be considered a threat. Hansel had been the first in a long time that had the potential to take his place, his burden, allowing Kaspar to pursue a life, a happiness all his own. Then there was Gretel, so willing to do anything to save her brother, a kindred spirit. She above all others could understand everything Kaspar had done. He had seen the way she looked at her brother, without judgment or disdain for what he was. Kaspar might protect the village, be treated like the protector he was, but there was always the underlying not one of us, different, dangerous voice that whispered to him even if the people wouldn't actually form the words. Gretel could be his one chance to not be alone anymore. Perhaps she could grow accept him. \"What are you going to do with them?\" he asked pointing towards the hunters. Their glares of contempt and hate were almost a physical thing beating down on him. \"What does it matter to you?\" questioned the queen, her annoyance growing with each word. \"He's no longer of value to you. There is no magic there.\" \"He has cost us dearly and deprived me of something I wanted. My satisfaction will come from flaying the flesh from his bones. He will be a message to future chosen not to deny the Lamiae what is their right, their duty.\" Gretel pulled against the hands holding her down. No one threatened her brother and got away with it. The lack of magic, was news to her and Hansel didn't seem to be in any hurry to deny the claim. No longer having his powers was as much of a solution as getting them under control, perhaps even better because the Lamiae would no longer have interest in him but she couldn't help the foreboding feeling welling in her gut that promised it wouldn't end there. The fact that Hansel wouldn't meet her gaze didn't ease her fears any. \"What about the girl? She's too old for your purposes and thus is of no use. I'd be willing to take her off your hands…\" \"Would you now?\" interrupted the queen, coming to stand in front of Kaspa; her sharp eyes scrutinizing ever inch. \"How magnanimous of you.\" Hansel knew Kaspar's intentions weren't pure, certainly not considering his blatant betrayal, but he wasn't fool enough to think he and Gretel stood a chance against a whole nest of Lamiae. Against Kaspar… Gretel could handle one man, even if he did practice the dark arts. \"Let him take Gretel.\" His voice sounded small in such a large space but it commanded everyone's attention. \"Let him have Gretel and I'll give you anything you want,\" promised the hunter. \"No,\" hissed Gretel, struggling even harder to get free. The queen rose from her throne and sauntered over to Hansel. Running one of her sharp claws down the side of his face she asked, \"And what could you have that I could possibly want?\" \"You want magical boys right?\" Determination filled in the holes of confidence in his voice. The queen's sickening smile was answer enough. \"I can find them for you. I know where they'll be.\" The queen cocked her head in intrigue as she considered the hunter's words. Having two minions to aid her sisters in their hunting would increase their spoils and both seemed to have a weakness for people that were easy to snuff out. At the very least she could replace her current servant. If she could read the subtle signs of body language amongst humans then the key to controlling both men might just be one woman. Of course, there were other ways to ensure Hansel's compliance and unyielding fidelity \"You amuse me hunter. You'll stay here, of course, and the little bitch can go with Kaspar.\" Her demeanor took on an even more threatening tone. \"Where she'll stay until you prove you're going to be useful.\" Gretel glared at Hansel, desperately trying to get her feelings on the subject through his thick, stubborn skull. If there was one thing they should have learned over the years, was they were better when they faced things together, never mind the insult that Gretel could be passed around as property to be 'looked after.' There was a special ass kicking in this for Hansel when they got out this situation. Hansel bowed his head. He messed up so badly, he messed everything up. The hole he had plunged them all in was so deep, even the strongest ray of sunlight couldn't find its way to him now. His first mistake had been placing witches into two categories: alive = bad, dead = good. Then at the first test of loyalty, he'd shut Gretel out when she threatened to prove his beliefs wrong, when she wanted to embrace her birthright. He'd let Mina die, he'd hurt Ben. He was born a threat. Gretel blessed with the gifts of their mother left him cursed with them. He didn't even handle that well. He had so easily fallen prey to the trappings of the black arts and took the first easy out without thought for the consequences. It was time to man up and start making amends. \"Agreed.\" \"Hansel, no!\" protested Gretel as the Lamiae hauled her to her feet. She scrambled to find purchase against the ground, anything to break free or slow things down. She needed a moment, a moment to think, to find a weapon, anything to stop her being separated from her brother, who was so clearly hiding something from her. Kaspar watched in fascination. He understood sacrifice, could sympathies with Hansel's position but it was something else to be the one he was handing his sister to. Desperate times and all that aside, Kaspar might have been the best of a series of lousy options but the hunter had still agreed to allow Gretel to go with him. \"Get her out of here,\" Hansel hissed, his heart breaking at the sight of Gretel struggling so hard to stay with a sinking ship. He tried not to resent Kaspar as he wrapped his hand around Gretel's arm, whispered in her ear and took the lead as he and the two Lamiae holding her escorted her out of the room. He let his eyes linger until the last sign of her disappeared out of sight. It was the right thing to do, not another mistake. She could take care of herself, and do that even better against only two Lamiae and Kaspar, who would probably be stupid enough to underestimate the strength that lay beneath her natural beauty. Sauntering back to her throne, the queen retook her seat. \"Bring him to me.\" Hansel relaxed into their strong grip. There was no use in struggling; he was where he wanted to be. Each step forward, furthered his resolve. His mistakes started when he began to doubt who he was. Yes, he didn't truly understand who he was until Muriel exposed his family's secret, but deep down on some level, he knew. He was almost within reach of her sickening claws when he twisted and jerked suddenly. It wasn't enough to free himself of his guards but enough to get a hand free, and really that all he needed. Continuing his momentum, he plucked the knife attached to one of the creature's belt, completing his turn by slicing off the hand still tightly wrapped around his other arm. The creature let out a sickening howl as she tumbled to the side, thrown off balance by the loss of the appendage that was still wrapped around Hansel. Knife dripping with blood, he didn't hesitate to drive it deep in the other guard's neck. The body fell heavily, pulling the blade from Hansel's grasp and tumbling to the ground with the dead. The queen sprung into action bringing her claws down and tearing through the hunter's already shredded back. He stumbled, dropping to his knee. She moved into position to offer the final striking blow to remove a thorn in her side, when Hansel sprung up. Her forward momentum ceased and she looked at him for a long moment trying to determine what he had done. Hansel stood there, chest heaving and heart pounding as he waited for the queen to put the picture together, for realization to dawn on her. He, the lowly mortal had run her through, the claws from the hand he pulled off his wrist carving out five perfect holes as the claws appeared on the other side. \"What have you done?\" she snarled. \"I killed you without magic, bitch.\" He brought his foot up, pushing her off of her impalement to collapse boneless on the floor. There was a certain satisfaction in watching his tormentor twitch in agony. The tell tale sounds of the rest of the nest coming to avenge their fallen rang out, but he would take this moment, this small victory before it all went to hell. \"You think you've won anything?\" she choked out around a mouthful of blood. \"Another will rise up and take my place. Unlike you we serve a purpose. We protect the world from your kind's natural defects and megalomania. You'll pay for this.\" \"Probably. But you won't be around to see it.\" A red orb appeared in the queen's hand, fluid like a ball of flame. It took a second to catch Hansel's eye and another to move from her hand to his body like a possessed firefly. \"Neither will you.\" He grunted as it hit him square in the chest, a warm feeling spreading over him like wax from a candle. It through him off balance, knocking him to his knees. Witch's magic never worked on them, it usually passed right through with no ill effects. She smiled at the hunter's bewildered look with blood stained teeth. \"No magic remember. No protection.\" As realization dawned on the man kneeling next to her, life left her body.[Chapter 21] Gretel made her guards work for every step, pushing when they pulled and pulling when they tried to push. She could see right through Hansel's promise and knew she had precious moments to get back to her brother before he did something rash; something permanent. \"You know,\" offered Kaspar casually, falling behind the group, \"I made a deal with the devil because the devil seemed to have all the tricks and the better hand. Then, one day there was a moment when I realized the mountain wasn't so insurmountable anymore but complacency made it easier to continue on with the status quo. Had your Queen not broken the tenuous terms of our agreement I would have continued abiding by our terms.\" The two guards struggling with Gretel stopped to glance back at their ally; curiosity coloring their faces as they tried to decipher the drabble spewing from his lips. The element of surprise played against them, their lightning fast reflexes and sheer strength failing against the streaks of black smoke that sprung forth from Kaspar's hands. Striking forth like birds of prey with the sharpness of a blade, they shredded the Lamiae's necks open releasing geysers of blood to paint the walls. Gretel staggered in her release, the oppressive grip of her captors going uselessly slack around her harms. She pulled a blade free from the corpse crumpled at her feet and whirled around. Kaspar hit the wall with a thud, her forearm pressing tightly against his throat while her other hand brandished the blade dangerously close to his exposed artery. \"Give me a reason to not kill you where you stand for what you've done,\" she spat. There was fire in Gretel's eyes that would have stole his breath if he wasn't finding it so difficult to breathe with her arm pressing painfully against him. He tried to choke out an answer, but nothing intelligible passed his lips. The hunter wanted to press harder, to punish the man before her that had betrayed them so completely. Kaspar had not only played her for a fool but put the person who mattered most in harm's way. Every fiber of her being screamed for vengeance for a brother she would protect at all costs, not unlike the man before her had done for the people and place he held dear. She eased some of the pressure from her arm. \"Make your words convincing or they will be your last.\" His shoulders rose as he sucked in a deep breath. \"You'll never get your brother out of here without my help,\" he croaked. \"I don't need your help,\" Gretel snarled, defiant. \"I think you do.\" She hated to admit it, but her odds were better with someone watching her back. \"One wrong move, and it will be your last,\" she warned, stepping away from the wall. She tipped her head back the way they had come, willing to take Kaspar's help at face value but unwilling to turn her back on him. \"After you.\" He pried himself off the wall, dust and dirt shaking loose as he began to walk. He took the lead without protest, able to ask for no more than the small leniency he'd been granted. Together they moved through the corridor, Gretel unleashing untamed fury aided by Kaspar's formerly tamed magic. The formidable might of the Lamiae was no match for a thoroughly pissed off sister on a mission; there was nothing left to lose and only one goal: get to Hansel. An influx of soldiers flooded the halls with a horrible cry only to meet a bloody and horrible end. Cuts and hard hits did nothing to deter Gretel, proceeding forward as though nothing had touched her. Kaspar stopped short as he entered the Queen's cavern; the scene not quite what he had predicted. The surrealness of watching Hansel impale the Queen with a hand of one of her own warriors filled him with both hope and dread. The one that had saw fit to hurt the people Kaspar had tried to protect was punished, but the rest of the nest would rise up to destroy the threat to their clan. His shock was broken as the Queen gave one last parting gift to Hansel, sealing the hunter's fate as well. Gretel, a few moments behind didn't hesitate, running towards the crumpled heap of a brother. Her knees hit the ground hard as her frantic hands ditched her weapon and sought purchase to wrap her brother in her arms. \"Hansel! Hansel, look at me.\" Blood slicked her hands as she pulled him closer; the open slashes on his back still seeping. Her voice trembled as she mumbled, \"You're okay, you're okay.\" Hansel opened his eyes. \"Gretel.\" He clung to her tightly, reveling in her presence. His heart slowly returned to a normal rhythm as his mind reconciled what he had seen and heard in the village after the Queen had unleashed her powers on the people there and what the Queen had imparted to him. He spent his life hating magic and had finally found a way to purge it from his life only to be left weak and vulnerable in a new way. \"Are you alright?\" she asked, searching every inch of Hansel for anything life threatening. The gashes and minor wounds could wait until they were out of the caves but first she needed to know if they could even move him. Hansel fought back the rolling nausea. Denial was rearing its ugly head as he wracked his brain for anyway to dismiss the red orb as something benign, a trick of the light and nothing more. Witches' magic didn't work on them, not because they were special but because of a spell their mother had cast to protect Gretel and he had gone and purge himself of all magic, never thinking of the one good thing magic had given him. The relief in Gretel's eyes, held Hansel's tongue firmly in place. \"They'll rally around a new leader and come to finish us off. We should put as much distance between us and those that remain as we can,\" offered Kaspar, not wanting to press their luck any further than they had to. They may have inflicted damage to the clan but a poked bear was just fired up to get into a real fight. \"We have to Hansel,\" soothed Gretel as she pulled him to his feet. He let out a small groan as the movement pulled uncomfortably at his back, leaning a little too heavily on his sister. It was awkward but the siblings managed to find a rhythm that Hansel could manage as they followed Kaspar back through the winding corridors to freedom. Gretel felt a surge of satisfaction as she took in her handiwork of death and destruction strewn along their path. The Lamiae had put them through hell when they already had their hands full with magic and its collateral damage. Now, that those who thought they could lay a hand on her brother and get away with it were in pieces on the floor, she could finally put a genuine smile on her face. Things were going to be alright now. \"Ouch,\" hissed Hansel, squirming on the chair. \"Don't be such a baby,\" chastised Gretel, \"and hold still.\" She plunged the cloth back into the bowl of water to rinse it before continuing to clean Hansel's wounds; keeping one eye on Kaspar as he moved around the small cottage collecting books and vials. The witch was a flutter of activity to Gretel's new found calm. \"Are you almost done?\" protested Hansel, having his fill of being poked and prodded. He wanted to lay down and sleep for a week; a bone weary tiredness relentlessly pulling at him. He told himself it was the usual exhaustion from a fight and nothing more, but he knew what was coming; he'd seen the village. \"I could get done faster if you'd hold still,\" scolded his sister; it was playful, filled more with relief that Hansel was alive and more or less unscathed, than irritation at an uncooperative patient. \"I need to grab some more bandages. Stay still.\" Hansel could feel Kaspar's eyes on him the second Gretel left the room. \"Are you going to tell her?\" he demanded. Hansel opted to play dumb, it was the best way to figure out what lie Kaspar was referring to. He didn't mean to lie to Gretel and truthfully, they weren't outright lies, simply lies of omission. He couldn't bear the look of disappointment that would color her face if he told her about his weakness with magic or just what lengths he had gone to to purge himself of it. Then there was the magic used against him by the queen. How was he going to tell her that he wasn't going to walk away from this one? \"Tell her what?\" \"I saw what happened back in the cave.\" \"Is there a cure?\" the hunter asked, knowing deep down that his fate was sealed. \"None that I know of. For all those I've seen inflicted, I've never seen anyone survive.\" The last little piece of hope he'd been holding onto shattered. He hadn't been aware of how badly he needed Kaspar to tell him it was going to be alright until he was told it wasn't. All he had left was denial. \"Well, we don't know if it worked so there's no point in worrying Gretel.\" His voice shook a little and by the look on Kaspar's face, the other man didn't buy it either. \"It takes about a month, if that's any consolation.\" There was almost a hint of sympathy from Kaspar and Hansel snorted with disinterest. \"It starts like many other sicknesses. Tiredness, loss of appetite, pain, escalating to vomiting blood, feeling of being cold and delirium.\" \"Sounds like fun,\" the hunter spat bitterly. He'd seen his fair share of illness and curses; he could imagine all too well what lay ahead. \"Do you even know how to have fun?\" teased Gretel returning with an armful of bandages. She raised his arms to make wrapping his back easier and made a mental note to force him to take it a bit easier for the next couple of days. \"What are we going to do about the Lamiae?\" \"They won't be after you brother anymore and those that are left will disappear until they can replenish their numbers. Besides, they won't be after you, I'm a more desirable target should they return,\" answered Kaspar. Gretel turned to protest; the only way to be sure was to see them all dead herself and not leave it to chance in the hands of another, especially one that had started their friendship with the intent of betraying them. Hansel grabbed her wrist. \"Let's just go home Gretel.\" The request shocked Gretel. Hansel was never one to run from a fight, even to save himself and they certainly didn't have any place they called home . \"Home?\" \"You should listen to your brother,\" interrupted Kaspar. Hansel shook his head. \"Home, or go find Ben and Edward, anywhere but here.\" \"Alright,\" she agreed, unsure what to make of the sheer oddness of his request. \"We'll catch up with Edward and Ben. Are you alright?\" There was something about her brother, something different that she couldn't place. Hansel sucked in a deep breath, committing to the lie. \"I'm fine, just really want to get out of this place.\" Rain clouds threatened to spill as the siblings made their last preparation for their journey to meet up with the other half of their group. Gretel was outside grabbing a few apple from the tree outside as Hansel crossed the threshold of Kaspar's home. From behind Kaspar asked, \"Are you ever going to tell her?\" \"No. She'll put all her energy into trying to find a cure and I'd rather not waste my last days on something foolish. We'll meet up with our friends and keep doing what we do until I can't do it anymore then Gretel will have Edward and Ben to continue on with. No use making her miserable with something that can't be changed.\" He walked away before getting a reply. Other people no longer mattered. He had a small amount of time to reunite their weird makeshift family and make sure Gretel was going to be taken care of. That was the only thing that mattered now. The end. Epilogue The forest was dark and silent. The ruins of the house, the last testament to the inviting greatness that had been built there, were as forgotten as the former occupant. What was now laid to waste after a brief surge of life had brought battle to its front door had stood quietly for years and planed to continue that ominous shadow over the forest. A bright purple wave flooded the forest; light spreading everywhere in a ripple effect that quickly moved past the house, continuing on its journey to parts unknown. The signs of age and weather slowly pulled themselves back from the wood and candy that had made up the home. The stove, long gone cold burst to life with a start, the black flame springing forth. It began to die as a pitiful moan echoed out of the stove. Carefully a gnarled hand stretched out, fumbling for purchase. Gradually the being began to pull itself out of the fire, the flames giving birth to a life it had formerly snuffed out. The candy looked around the sad state of her home, a place that had been a triumphant of her ingenuity in the hunt for children. She would restore its greatness, and the strength of her powers and then she was going to hunt down the bastard children that had dared defy her. The witch was back and going to eat those horrible brats if it was the last thing she did. Hansel and Gretel were going to die. Thank you to everyone who read this story and especially those that stuck with it through the years (Yes years, sorry about that). A special thanks to those that took the time to review. They're appreciated. I do have plans for a sequel to this story if there's any interest but I don't have a timeline on when that would be ready to start being posted. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: The Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters characters are not mine, just borrowed for this sto"},{"Movie":"Crimson Peak","Title":"Blind Monster","Author":"JoleneMarselis","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589951","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Thomas Sharpe knew he deserved this… this cage-like existence. Prison would have been too kind for him. No – he deserved this eternal night as penance for his deeds. Or lack thereof. Blind as he was, he saw his past clearer than ever. He had let his sister get away with murder, because... well, that was the one thing that was unclear to him. He should have stopped her but somehow he couldn't. She had been in so much pain all her life, at the hands of their parents. She had always protected him... taken care of him. It had never occurred to him to question her actions, or go against her will, even though her deeds had been gruesome and made his stomach turn, far before Edith ever helped him realise this. He had been weak, and this had led to the death of more innocent people than he liked to think about, including in the end, Lucille's. If he had forced her to get help, somewhere safe, somewhere that was not like the institution their heartless father had sent her, then maybe she could have, in time, become happy, rather than the hateful creature she had become. This blind prison had put his life in a new light, and it was filled with regret for what could have been. So much harm had been done... harm that he could have stopped if had just stood up... If he was sure of one thing, it was that he deserved this punishment. When the village children called him a monster and threw stones at him, he knew it was but a small price for the hurt he had inflicted on others. He knew not what he looked like, but he was sure that, whatever it was, it was less frightening than the man who lived within. The doctors had said it had been a miracle that he had survived the attack, but it was not. He simply had not deserved to die. He deserved to suffer. He deserved this black emptiness. Even though only one eye had been destroyed, the nerve of the other had been damaged, making him lose his sight completely. He had not fought it. He did not have it in him to fight. He never had. Maybe if had been stronger, all of this would never have happened. But he only had himself to blame. Lucille... Poor Lucille. She had always protected him from harm, whether it was the corporal punishments of their father or the mental torture of their mother. Their parents had hated each other and, since they could not hurt each other without fearing retribution, they had redirected their anger towards their children, who were powerless against them. Lucille had gotten the brunt of it – unlike him, she had never backed down, no matter how much they punished her. He was the one who had been the weakling, hiding in cupboards for hours until the worst of their anger was over. Hiding, being unobtrusive, trying not to be offensive or noticed in any way... his childhood had been one of invisibility, until his parents had sent him away when Lucille went to the asylum. He missed her, even though he knew it was wrong. But for all those years, they had only had each other to love. He now knew they had gone too far... Part of him had always known, but he had been so hungry for love, just like Lucille had been. He should have stopped her. But when the only other touch you knew was pain, a touch that was pleasurable was quite intoxicating. All she had done was try to protect him and love him – but somehow it had all gotten perverted. He had not fought her when she first revealed her plans... it hadn't sounded too bad. Marriage often was not much more than a mutually beneficial arrangement this day and age, so to find a rich heiress that could help them save the house and fund his inventions sounded like a plan. The girl had been nice enough, not at all like their mother. The fonder he became of her though, the more jealous his sister became. Lucille started poisoning his mind: according to her, his wife had taken lovers to her bed and they had given her syphilis. He saw his wife growing weaker and more ill, but by then he no longer cared for her. Her death had been a relief. Soon he had found a new wife. It had no been until his second marriage started falling apart and his wife started to show the same symptoms as his first that he realised that his sister had been poisoning his wives as well as his mind. At that point, he had confronted her, but somehow she had convinced him that this was the only way and they could not turn back now. From there on... well... he only had himself to blame. He could have saved them all, but instead he had stood back and did nothing. Like always. The blindness had given him much time to think. There was little else to do, now that he had lost sight in both eyes. Edith had been very generous. She had wanted a divorce, which he had granted without question. Who could be married to someone weak like him? The marriage had been unbound on the grounds that it was never consumed, which was untrue; but, as they both swore to it, who was ever going to check? He hoped she had found happiness now, perhaps with Alan. She deserved it. He had not heard from her in five years now. Edith had taken care of him though. As he had been unconscious for a month, she had kept him free from prosecution. By the time he had woken up, it had all been arranged and he was free to go. It seemed unfair to pin it all on his sister – he wanted to do his penance – but Edith had said he had suffered enough. Again, he had been weak. He should have insisted. That was why he was in his own prison now. He had asked Edith to take care of Allerdale Hall – sell it, burn it to the ground – he did not care – he could not imagine anyone wanting to live in that house of horrors. She had turned it into a quarry that was being mined by the machine he had invented. It had made a pretty sum of money. At first, he had insisted that she take it all. He did not care for the money and he certainly did not feel like he deserved it. To be a blind beggar on the streets, living in the gutter, seemed much more befitting. Edith wouldn't hear of it, though. She had bought him a small cottage in a rural area and found him a nurse who could see to his everyday needs. Solitude, that was to be his confinement. Edith had meant well, though. The scandal of what happened had reached all the papers – everyone knew of the terrible Sharpes. There really weren't many places left where his name would be unrecognised and, after that, his scars would confirm the rest of the story. So that was it – he was cast to the edge of society, where no one would pester him, except the young lads from the village; every now and again, they would challenge each other to sneak into the house of the weird man that lived atop the hill. Dark stories were told at night by the fire about what had happened to the lone man to land him in such a position, but none were darker than the truth. Although, he was not completely alone the nurse, Mrs Allsop, lived with him. She was a taciturn woman. He suspected she knew his history and despised him for it, for there was something rough in her treatment, but he was fine with that. It added to his punishment. His days consisted of sitting in darkness, one day sliding into the next. She would feed him and clothe him but otherwise leave him alone. He did not venture out; the yard was as far as he came for his exercise, just so he would not completely lose his mobility. He could not wait till the day he wasted away into oblivion, just like he had never had been. Maybe by then, all would be right with the world again.[Chapter 2] He could still see in his dreams... not that that was much of a relief. They were filled with death and haunting. His sister, his three wives, his mother... Sometimes he'd even dream Edith had died, and she would look at him with such hatred in her eyes. Then she would turn into Lucille and gauge his eyes out, but strangely enough he could still see as she fell down with her skull all caved in. He'd wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. Come morning, Mrs Allsop would complain about his screaming but she would never come in at night to comfort him. Not that he deserved comfort. Daytime was no better. He was dressed with the help of the nurse, fed his oatmeal with a spoon and then sat in his chair, where he would spend most of the day. Whenever he got up to stretch his legs, she would shout at him, telling him it was far to dangerous for a blind man to be running around on his own, and that she would not nurse him if he was to fall and break something. Not that she ever took him out on her own accord. So he sat, and listened at the sounds the house made... the creaking of the wood... the bustling of Mrs Allsop as she went about her daily chores in the house. A few times a week, a merchant would call with supplies. Thomas would listen to them talk... the merchant talking about the weather and the affairs of the village, Mrs Allsop complaining about everything – especially him. He did not want to be a bother to her, but he couldn't help being dependent on her. So he remained quiet, bothering her as little as possible, spending his days in isolation and contemplation... one day sliding into the next until it was hard to tell what day it was. All he knew was that it was spring now, but this was more clear by the fact that the faint smell of flowers was coming through the window than that he actually knew the date. The day of the week was a mystery to him – he tried to remember when it had last been Sunday, the day Mrs Allsop went to church and left him on his own for a few hours. The one day he could sneak outside and sit on the bench at the front door, listening to the sounds of nature around him. It was his guilty pleasure – the only one he allowed himself in this morose existence. He realised though that she had not been to church in at least a week, although he was not sure how many days had passed. He wondered what was wrong – no matter what happened, that woman usually went to churchbeing of a very devout disposition. Well except for the swearing. To make up for this she went out of her way to threaten him with hell and brimstone. He didn't fear Satan...If he even existed he could not possibly be worse than his parents. Still it was best for everyone not to antagonise her. By the sound of, it she was doing something, God knows what, upstairs. He had never been there, not in the five years he lived here. He had hardly even visited the other rooms downstairs. His life consisted of this one room – of which he knew every inch. His bed was here, as well as his chair. She did not allow him to be in any other. It was like he was a little boy again. But it didn't matter. Society was not for him, it never had been. If mrs Allsop only knew his days were spent atoning for the sins of the past, then she would have known there was no need threatening him. He already was in hell, and it was dark and lonely. There were days that he wondered if he maybe already died, and this perhaps was limbo, since not even God knew what to do with him. He would wonder whether or not Lucille had gone to hell. He hoped god was merciful, because no matter what she had done, she did not belong there. She had been confused and in pain for most of her life until had driven her insane, but it not her fault. If she was in hell, and he was not, he hoped he could take her place. At those moments he would pray, to the utter confusion of mrs Allsop. Yes, he was sure she knew who he was, and thought him the devil incarnate. Other days he wished the ghosts of the past would come to haunt him. Edith saw them... why couldn't he? After all, they were his family. His mother, his sister... even his father... why had they forsaken him? He wished for their presence, even if they were only there to taunt him. Anything but this loneliness. Once he believed he had heard his sister whisper his name. But it seemed that the harder he tried the further away he was. Maybe they did not exist after all, and after death there was just a big black vacuum, much like the one he was living in now. Maybe Edith was delusional as well, just not in a malicious way. \"Time for lunch, Master Sharpe,\" Mrs Allsop rasped, coughing, Interrupting his thoughts. She dropped a plate unceremoniously beside him. He reached for the spoon that had hit his hand, but was slapped away. \"I don't think so! I am not washing your clothes just because you got goop all over yourself.\" She started jabbing the spoon in his mouth at a rate that barely left him time to swallow, getting her chore done as quick as possible. The food was bland and being fed was humiliating, but that was how it was. Another few hours, and she would undress him, put him in bed... and another day would have disappeared in oblivion. Mrs Allsop coughed again. Her cough was getting worse, he decided – he had heard it get gradually more chesty over the past few hoped whatever she had, didn't rub off on him, there was nothing worse than being sick in this prison of a body, with no distraction from his illness. \"Madam, if you need a doctor I am sure I can manage a few hours on my own I think,\" he remarked. \"I'm fine!\" she rasped, coughing even more,andhe screeched, muttering swear words about him under her breath. He heard every word, his sense of hearing having become heightened over the past years. He tried again, not just for her health, but also because her short absence would give him some much-needed freedom. \"I don't think you should neglect this, Mrs Allsop.\" \"Stop sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong, you blind bat.\" This time she did not even try to cover up her insults. \"There is nothing wrong with me, do you hear me?\" Grabbing his ear, she pinched it so hard he winced in pain. Protecting his ears from more of her malice and huddling into a small ball, he heard her leave the room. Fine, hopefully she would die of that damn cough, so he would be rid of her altogether. Yay, reviews, I love reviews! Duelladent: You hit the nail on the head, he is lost... And far from found, but that is why I love him. knightphoenix2: Thomas has never been bad, just weak. And Edith saw that in my view. She loves him, but he is not the man she thought she married.[Chapter 3] Something was wrong this morning. Mrs Allsop had not woken him like she always did, and he was pretty sure it was morning by now. It was not easy to tell time when it was always dark, no matter what time of day it was, but he had not had any dreams tonight, and he had the feeling that at least eight hours had passed since he had gone to bed. Just to be sure not to invoke Mrs Allsop's wrath, he had closed his eyes five times already, trying to get some more sleep just in case... but sleep wouldn't come, and he was wide awake now. He wasn't sure what to do. If she found him out of bed in the middle of the night, she would surely get mad... but he couldn't just stay here forever. Furthermore, his stomach had started growling, a sure sign it was no longer night. He made his way to the window and opened it. Birds were singing and the air was pleasantly warm. It was day – it had to be. He started making a bit more noise. Surely, if Mrs Allsop was awake, she would have come and found him by now. She would probably bite his ear off for getting out of the bed himself, but that was fine. After all, he couldn't just stay here in his nightshirt, could he? The house was absolutely quiet though – even the wood had stopped creaking, it seemed. Feeling his way to the door he opened it. \"Mrs Allsop, are you there?\" Nothing. Crossing the landing, he made his way to the kitchen. He had only been there a few times, so he crashed into pots and pans, making enough noise to wake the dead. No Mrs Allsop, though. The stove was cold and so was the hearth. Finding his way to the pantry, he stumbled upon some cheese, which he ate to settle his growling stomach. He hadn't even know they had cheese. Back in the hall, he opened the door to call out, before realising he was still not really dressed. The wind lifted up the hem of his nightshirt, and he felt the breeze caress his bare bottom. There was no answer here, either – so, embarrassed, he quickly closed the door. It wasn't likely anyone was out there, but still... he had so little decorum left, having to be dependent on others. The idea of exposing himself to the world was not a pleasant one. He went back to his room, found the antechamber where his clothes and other belongings that had long since lost their meaning were kept and, with a bit of difficulty, found a pair of pants which he put on, tucking his nightshirt in as well as he could. At least he would be semi-decent now, as his search continued to rooms he had never visited before. Most of the shelves here were full of dust – he could feel it on hi fingers. Mrs Allsop clearly only came here to get his clothes now and again. He remembered that her bedroom was upstairs, but the hall he was in had no stairs. He remembered where the sound of her going up came from, though. Making his way there, he found a door. Going though it, he could then feel a balustrade and stairs. A bit nervous, he started climbing the stairs, step by step. It was a spiral staircase – the steps wound around tightly and seemed very steep – or maybe it was just the fact that he hadn't climbed any stairs since leaving Allerdale Hall. At the top, he took a break. He tried to memorize where the staircase was were so he wouldn't fall down it later. Next, following the wall, he started exploring the rooms. There was a lot of furniture up here which he kept bumping into. He called out for Mrs Allsop again, with no answer. He hadn't expected one though – the rooms were too quiet. He crashed into a desk and things spilled to the floor with a loud clinking sound – the kind of sound coins made when they fell on the floor. He bent down and felt his way around. It felt like money, too – and there was a lot of it – on the desk, and on the floor. What was Mrs Allsop doing with all this? It seemed a lot for the daily expenses they had. He moved on though to what felt like the bed... And there she was. It was her hand he found first, and he shook it. \"Mrs Allsop! Wake up! Mrs Allsop!\" The hand was stone cold, though – and stiff. He felt her face – her mouth was open and so were her eyes. Panicked he started to back away, tumbling over several chairs. He needed to get help... But how? He had no idea in which direction the village was. Either way, it was too late – the woman he had depended on was clearly dead. He was – truly – all alone now. Strangely it didn't frighten him. He found his way back downstairs, back to his room where he sat down and thought. Practically. He needed to come up with a plan or he was gonna starve to death. No wait, that was impossible. Mrs Allsop did not go to the village for groveries much, almost everything was delivered here. So one of these people was bound to visit him soon, all he needed to do was wait for the doorbell to ring. After all it could only be a matter of days, and the pantry he had been in earlier had been well stocked. Carefully he made his way back to the pantry. Most of the food he found needed to be cooked, and with the stove out, he had no idea how to turn it back on. Finally he found a basket of apples. Grabbing one, he went outside, sitting himself down in front of his door. Anyone passing by had to see him, and then he could ask for help. Even those boys that liked to pester him would do at this point. It was a fine spring day, and he could feel the sun on his skin. The birds were singing to their heart's content, and bees buzzed around his head to get to the sweet smelling flowers around him. It felt glorious, such a shrill contrast to the woman laying dead in the attack. He wondered if they would blame him? He had a reputation, and surely once this became a police matter it would all be dug up again. Would he have to move again? Would they throw him in jail this time? Convicted for the one death that was not his fault. It seemed poetic justice. Chewing his apple he waited on what was to come. Knightphoenix2: The man Edith married does not exist. They therefor don't belong together. So it's only fair he divorced her. Guest: I love your theory of innocence. I think we can have a blindspot when it comes to those we love. It's not like we do't know, just admiting the truth is too painful. Because you need need to betray them. So it easier to live in the illusion. I think that was Thomas problem, to admit his sister was mad meant having to act, and condemn her to a fate worse than death. So he closed his eyes to that which he could not face. Guest2: It's Thomas who feels he should suffer. I would disagree personally. Letting her die was my pleasure *she said cackling like Lucille* Princess PrettyPants : only temporary LadyBookworm80 : I have said this before where it considers Tom Hiddleston, and I think it applies here as well. Get in line! LOL But well... help is on it's way megumisakura: Thank you[Chapter 4] It took three days before Thomas was found. By the end of the second day, he had managed to turn the stove back on without setting fire to himself. After all, he reminded himself, he had been an engineer when he could still see. Getting a stove to work was a breeze compared to assembling a steam engine. So, he had sought what he had needed and, with a bit of difficulty, got a match to light. After that, he had peeled and boiled himself some potatoes. It filled him with a sense of pride to be able to do something for himself. He was almost happy Mrs Allsop had died and so was no longer there to tell him off. And then he remembered his wish the night before she had died. Had he wished her to death? It filled him with disgust about himself. He had wanted her to die, wanted to be rid of her. And now she was – another victim of his selfishness. It was enough to make him toss his hard-made dinner across the table with a scream. He really was a monster, after all. The next morning, he had been woken by the ring of the doorbell. He had hurried outside quickly. His appearance must have been shocking, because the poor coal delivery boy stammered over his words even before Thomas had said anything. Thomas had needed his help though, so he started telling the boy what had happened. This only resulted in frightening the boy more, especially when he told him Mrs Allsop was dead. Getting back on his cart, the boy rushed out of there, leaving a bewildered Thomas who felt help might never come. He was wrong, though. An hour later, the village descended... They had left their pitch forks at home... for now... but the situation certainly was not cosy. A group of men approached him – he could hear them, but none spoke. Finally, one had been pushed forward. \"What's going on 'ere?\" a coarse voice asked. Thomas explained the situation. After that, they had followed him into the house, up the stairs. There was a definite odour of death up here now, Thomas could tell. The men had gasped – they were probably looking at the body – and, for a moment, he thought they would turn on him, lock him up in prison or worse. Instead, he got sidelined. The same man that had first spoken to him took him back downstairs, saying it would be safer if he stayed out of the way, in a most threatening way. Thomas had not objected... Had he ever, really? His cowardice resurfaced; he locked himself up in his room, the only room he had a key for, and waited while he cursed himself. But really, what else could he have done? As a blind man, he could not even see his opposition, let alone fight it. Mrs Allsop was already dead, so they couldn't hurt her any more. So, he let them. He let them roam free through his house whilst he sat huddled against the door, afraid they would break through. They made a lot of noise. Furniture was moved, broken even, by the sound of it. They cursed and they fought. He heard his name, followed by a lot of laughter. They knew exactly how weak he was and took advantage. He had no idea what they were doing exactly, but it sounded like a lot more than moving the body and taking it away. By nightfall, they were gone. And so were several kitchen chairs. He checked upstairs. The money that had been there was gone, but the body was not. The smell was becoming putrid, especially to his hypersensitive nose. He had left quickly, hiding back in his room. His nightmares that night had been worse than ever before. The next day, the women of the village came. They had seemed nice, making him the first decent breakfast in four days. The coroner came and took the body away. But the women had whispered... about guilt... about his ghastly appearance... about evil things. He heard how they planned to rob him, somehow thinking he was deaf as well as blind. The longer he sat there at the kitchen table, the bolder they became, until he finally slammed his fist on the table. The room fell into a deathly silence. Frightened by his own aggression, he fled to the one place he felt safe and bolted the room. The women had seen their chance, grabbing everything they could get their hands on and left. Later that day as he went to check, most of the cutlery was gone, as well as pots and pans. He didn't check upstairs. What did it matter? He was alone. They would come back every day to rob him further until there was nothing left, and no one would come to help him. Closing the door of his room, he laid down on his bed. If only he knew where the house keys were. He woke up several times that night, not sure of what he had dreamt but with a heart that was racing. The house seemed to whisper... the wood creaked... there were scratching sounds on the floor. Was it real, or was he finally losing his mind? Maybe he was becoming like his sister after all. His only solace was that he wasn't likely to harm anyone in his state. In the morning, all was calm again. The birds sang. He decided to get out. Leave. For good. If they were gonna take everything, he would not be here. But first, he needed some provisions, which meant seeing if those women had left any, Touching the walls, he made it there... and stumbled over something that yelped. What the hell... \"Pilot, it's ok. Good folk,\" a gentle female voice said. \"Hello... Mr Sharpe? My name is Janey Peregrine, I arrived late last night. \" They were already here. He tried to make a hasty retreat to his room, but the lack of food made him unsteady on his feet, and his head spun. \"Who are you? Are you from the village? I don't need any more of your help. I had enough!\" \"No, no! I just arrived last night. I'm from the agency. They sent me once they got word of what happened. I came as quick as I can but, it is still a day of travelling to come here from London,\" she explained. He didn't believe it. It sounded like another lie. \"Leave.\" \"I'm sorry, Mr Sharpe, but you look like you need my help. Why don't you tell me what is wrong?\" Was she that stupid? He was the one who was blind... surely, she did not have such an excuse. Perhaps she was just humoring him. \"Everything... Don't you see? They took everything. And now you will try to take what little I have got left. But I won't have it. Go!\" he said in as threatening a manner as he could master. It didn't work... and really, why would it? She was not a school kid scared of the blind monster in the lonely cottage. She didn't sound like she was easily frightened. And she did not sound naive.\"I promise I am here to help you. Why don't I make you something to eat?\" she spoke firmly. \"No! Just leave,\" he made one last desperate attempt. He was starting to sound more feeble already. Weariness was setting in. A new Mrs Allsop. No more freedom. He hadn't realized he had missed it so much that he had even considered becoming a beggar. \"I can't do that, sir. I'm hired to take care of you. Why don't you sit down and I'll make you some soup.\" And that was it. Thomas resigned himself to his fate. Why... why hadn't he just died? marissa-chihero67: thank you megumisakura: It will get bettr[Chapter 5] Mrs Allsop had been a terrible nurse – that was Janey's first conclusion – and Mr Sharpe had been seriously neglected. Janey had arrived the night before and had slept at the kitchen table, so her back was as hard as a board this morning. It had been a hard journey – she had done the last few miles on foot in the dark, as none of the villager had wanted to take her, not even for money. So, she went on, with a carpet bag containing all her worldly belongings in one hand, and a lantern in the other. Pilot followed her dutifully, like the big loyal dog that he was. She felt safe with him around. He would always protect her, no matter what. Dogs were so much better than humans in that respect. Luckily, it was the only cottage on the end of this road, and it was a moonlit night, so she found it fairly easily. Shining the light through the window, she had seen him lay asleep in his bed and had decided against calling out to him. She knew from experience blind people were easily spooked. The front door was open, so she had found her way into the kitchen, where she had fallen asleep on the kitchen table. She now understood why the villagers had not helped her. At daybreak, she had gone to explore. The house looked ransacked, although some of the deterioration dated far beyond the five days this man had been alone. The house was dusty and dirty, except for the rooms upstairs. They had been stripped of most of their belongings, except the bed that the woman had died in. It was eerie... the forgotten pillow, the dent of where once somebody had lain... There were more dents in the carpet, and outlines on the wall where the sun had not been able to bleach the wallpaper – these made it clear a lot of furniture had once been here, but it was gone now. It was a huge space up here, spanning the width of almost the entire house, divided into two rooms and a balcony. Thomas's room downstairs was tiny in comparison, from what she had been able to make out through the window the night before. Peaking through the window again this morning, she had found him still sleeping. The room had been locked. Poor man – he had to be exhausted, fending for himself. She didn't understand why he had agreed to this arrangement, though. He was the master of this house, blind or not. He didn't strike her as scared or weak when he had spoken to her, even though Edith had insisted that he was. Edith Cushing was the reason Janey was here. Four years ago, they had struck an unlikely friendship – the writer and the working class girl. Janey had gone to Miss Cushing's book signing, together with Mrs Withington, her charge at the time, who was a blind woman of 86 and whose health had already started to deteriorate. The woman had been adamant on going though – she had loved Miss Cushing's books, all read to her by Janey, and wanted nothing more than to hear the author's voice. Janey had been happy to go along. Miss Cushing had been lovely, and seeing that the woman Janey was accompanying was blind, had given them front row seats so Mrs Withington could hear every word. Afterwards, Miss Cushing had taken Janey and the old lady out for tea. She had been so kind and candid with them, like a breath of fresh air. She didn't treat Mrs Withington like an invalid either, which was much to her credit. Most people seemed to think blind people were deaf and stupid as well, but not Edith. They had such a wonderful conversation that by the end it felt like they were friends, the three of them. After that, a correspondence started. Mrs Withington had dictated a letter to Janey to thank Edith, and to her surprise the – by this point – famous writer had taken time to reply in a lengthy and very amusing letter. Janey felt moved that somebody like her would take time out to reply to an old lady; so, the next time Mrs Withington sent a letter, Janey had added in one of her own. And from there on, it had continued. Edith 's letters were a treat in the Withington household, and she replied to Janey's and Mrs Withington's letters separately. Sometimes, Janey would share her letter with Mrs Withington, but as her friendship with Edith continued, sometimes the letters were just too intimate to share. It felt good to have a friend her own age to share things with. Despite their differences in class, the women were very alike. Mrs Withington's death six months ago had been an extreme blow to Janey. Not only had she lost a friend – for indeed, Mrs Withington had been one of the nicest employers she had ever had – but also her home. All she got was a small severance pay... And Pilot, the poor dog. Nobody in Mrs Withington's family had wanted the beast, and he had been about to be put down. Janey wouldn't have it – Pilot was smart and he was sweet, and her link to her former employer. It had not been easy finding lodgings that would take her and the dog, and finding work had proven even more difficult. Edith, sweet as she was, had immediately offered to help, but there was little she could do to help her friend from across the pond, except send money, and Janey refused to be a charity case. Things had started to look bleak though, when Janey had reached the bottom of her savings. Then, two days ago, a telegram had come from Edith, asking for her help. Thomas's nurse had suddenly died – Edith had just gotten word from an acquaintance in the village that kept an eye on Thomas. Through the years, Edith had told her everything about her life, including her marriage to Thomas Sharpe and the disaster that had followed.. Janey had told her about the hardships in her life in return. These were the letters she did not share with Mrs Withington. Edith felt like a sister to Janey, and Janey would not betray Edith's secrets. The request had surprised Janey, though. Edith knew all about Janey's trouble with the male gender. The telegram therefore also seemed to stress the fact that Thomas was absolutely not dangerous. Janey could hear her friend's desperation. Besides, Janey was pretty desperate herself at that point – by the end of next week she would probably be out on the streets anyway. So, she went. And now here she was, sitting at the kitchen table, looking across at the man she was to work for. He looked unkempt – his hair and beard were long and tangled. Not what you would expect to happen over the course of a week. How long had he lived like this? And why had no one done anything about it? She was going to have to inform Edith. The stuff that had been stolen was not coming back. Janey would need accommodation as well – she was NOT sleeping in the bed of a dead woman. As soon as she had fed Thomas and gotten him clean and presentable, she was going to send a telegram to Edith.[Chapter 6] She had helped him to the table ever so gently and given him a spoon, so she obviously trusted him to eat by himself. Her food tasted great, even though, with the kitchen plundered, he was sure there wasn't much left in the pantry. Her voice sounded nice, and her words were pleasant... Something wet was bumping against his hand that made him disoriented. He dropped his spoon... What the... \"Pilot! Bad dog! You know you can't do that. Sit! And stay!\" Janey scolded. She had sounded fierce. For a split second, he thought she had spoken to him, and he had involuntarily cringed. Bad memories resurfaced. He heard his mother's voice and didn't dare to move. Janey gently patted his shoulder as she gave him a clean spoon.\"Sorry about that. Pilot knows better. He used to be a companion to a blind lady. My former employer, Lady Worthington. He hasn't been the same since her death though. Neither of us are... But he is a great dog. Big dog, too.\" \"Dog? You brought a dog?\" He didn't like dogs... Not after that mutt. More memories resurfaced. \"Yes. I had been assured it was ok. He is very gentle but large. Come Pilot. Come say hello to Mr Sharpe... He will probably lay his head in your lap. It's what he has learned to do. You don't have to be scared,\" she reassured him. \"I'm not.\" His quiver betrayed him, though. He didn't like dogs. Suddenly, a weight fell into his lap. \"Stroke his head,\" Janey encouraged. \"I can't. I might hurt him. I might poke his eye out.\" \"He is used to blind people. If you are worried, look away in the distance. He thinks you can see because you look at him. You're not blind that long, are you? You still look at the sound, even though you can't see.\" \"Five years.\" Five years of nothing but darkness. It felt a lifetime. But, then again, he had spent a lifetime in darkness. Only, in the past few years, he couldn't actually see as well. He carefully stroked the dog's head carefully. \"He's massive. Are you sure he's not a lion?\" \"Quite sure – he is harmless. You tripped over his tail when you came in, you know, and he hardly whimpered. But he can guard us with the proper commands.\" The dog started to grunt. \"No, Pilot. Down.\" A small whimper and dog laid his head back in Thomas' lap. \"As you see... Sorry, hear... He is very smart, and listens well. With him around, neither of us have anything to fear. \" \"He won't attack me?\" \"No... Well, unless you plan on attacking me. I was almost robbed once... That was, until Pilot came out of nowhere, and grabbed the man's arm...\"she said, lovingly. \"And that is why I love you, don't I, boy?\" The last bit was obviously said to the dog, and not to him. The dog's head was now off his lap and probably showering his mistress with attention, since his tail was wagging against Thomas' leg. \"Do you think the villagers will be back?\" she asked. \"I don't know. They might be if they think there is anything more they can take away. I wish I had a key for the doors. All I have is the one for my room,\" Thomas sighed \"I think I will have to go to the village this afternoon to get provisions. I'll see if I can find a locksmith whilst I am there. It's better if that front door is secure – the villagers were not exactly friendly to me upon my arrival. Do you want me to leave Pilot here to keep the place safe? Usually one look at him is enough to keep anyone at bay.\" \"No... Best if you take him with him. You are new here, and they might take advantage of you, otherwise.\" Besides, he wasn't sure if he wanted to be alone with the huge beast. \"Don't worry, I'm not that easily fooled. Now, did you enjoy breakfast?\" she said cheerfully as he had finished. \"Yes. Very much so. Thank you.\" She had no idea how much. No idea of Mrs Allsop's treatment of him. \"Then I think it's time we get you cleaned up. I hope you don't mind me saying, but you are looking a bit unkempt.\" It didn't sound like an insult, just an observation. And she was right. He looked like a downright monster, he was sure. Whether cleaning him up was going to help though... There was not enough soap in the world to clean his soul, that was for sure. \"I apologise...\" She interrupted him immediately. \"No need, I am sure the last few days were a harrowing experience, and getting a bath was not a priority. But what would you say if I start running you one now and I cut your hair whilst we wait for the water to boil?\" They had a bath? Mrs Allsop had occasionally brushed him off with a rough cloth and that was it. He realised he had to smell awful, where Janey... smelled of jasmine as she brushed past him, clearing the table. \"I'll put the bath in the hallway if you don't mind. Easier to drain.\" \"That's fine.\" He was not going to make a fuss. \"Alright, water is getting to the boil. If you could come with me and sit on the chair in the middle of the clearing, then I can get to you from all sides and not cut your ears off.\" She grabbed his arm and guided him to the chair. Then he could feel her going to work. He had not realised it, had not thought about it, but his hair had gotten long, and so had his beard. Mrs Allsop had not touched it once in all those years... He probably looked like a caveman. It was literally like a weight was falling off him. \"Alright, that was the big bit... now I'm going to try and shape it. Your hair is a bit tangled, so I'm first going to try and cut it, before I comb it. I'll try not to hurt you.\" It moved him, to be treated so kindly. Gathering his hair, she took her first snip, and a weight was lifted from his shoulders. She was ever so gentle, but his hair was VERY tangled. There had not been a comb run through it for years, he knew that. Yet, he didn't feel more than the occasional tweak. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to have her around. \"I don't know if you want your beard shaved but I don't have the equipment... I also don't really know how to. So, maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea for me to try.\" There was a little giggle. He laughed as well... It was the first time he had done so in years, and it took him by surprise. \"Sorry,\" he apologised. \"For what?\" She had started cutting his hair again. He could hear the scissors snip away. \"I did not mean to laugh at you.\" \"Well, that's my own fault for suggesting something so silly. Anyway, you look quite handsome with a small beard.\" Her hand was steadying his chin \"You don't have to say that. I know I must look awful... With the scar and the eyes.\" \"You look fine. Your eyes are a bit curious, being two different colours, but not scary. And the scar is hardly visible underneath the beard... Done.\" She meant the hair, he realised. \"I'll go and get your bath ready\" He wasn't... a monster? Perhaps she was just being kind. She had been kind so far. Far kinder than the villagers... far, far kinder than Mrs Allsop... kinder than he deserved. He could hear her bustling around the kitchen, filling the tub. \"Ready.\" She sounded like she was smiling, not cursing like the old woman had every time he asked for something. She came and took his hands, leading him to the bath. Suddenly, he felt shy. He was going to have to undress in front of this woman... He realised Mrs Allsop had seen him naked. But, somehow, she hadn't mattered. She had been old... and mean. He hadn't cared for her opinion, and she certainly had not cared for his. But Janey... she sounded young... her voice was light and soft. Surely, he could not... \"You can leave your clothes on the pegs here and here,\" she said, guiding his hands again. \"I'll leave you to wash by yourself. If you need help, just call me. Where can I get you some fresh clothes?\" He sighed with relief. At least she wouldn't see him naked and helpless. Maybe things would be different with her around. He got the key from his pocket. \"The armoire in my room. It might be a bit messy... I had to rely on myself these past few days.\" \"Don't worry, I'll get it all sorted. You just enjoy your bath.\" No, she was not bad to have around. I forgot to thank you kind reviewer last time, sorry... But here to make amends: Princess PrettyPants : Janey has indeed...

Edith is very much out of the picture at this point though.[Chapter 7] The room he lived in was even worse than she had imagined. It was more of a hovel, really, and very stuffy. She opened a window to let some air in but that just kicked up the dust. Everything in here was in piles and looked as if it had been untouched for the past few years. It was like Mrs Allsop had thought she didn't need to do any cleaning, that it it didn't matter anyway, as Thomas couldn't see the mess. But still... Janey knew what had happened – Edith had told her everything. It had been a strange experience for her. To her, man was the aggressor. But Thomas... He was a victim. It was his sister that had been the aggressor, and he... it sounded to her like he had been paralysed, too scared to move. That strange sense of loyalty you felt to family, even when they were horrible. She knew that all too well. Though Thomas's situation was far more complex, she did understand his way of thinking. She could even understand his sister. How often had Janey wanted to take her father's belt and strangle the son of a bitch with it when he hurt her or her mother? She could understand how the abuse, in time, could have led to insanity. It had left her mother far from sane – it had turned her into a bitter woman that spread her bile out over everyone. And still Janey loved her... Despite all the harsh words, she loved her mother. So, Janey understood Thomas... Probably better than Edith had ever done. Edith had known the pain of loss, but never abuse. Her father might have been brunt, but his actions had been to shelter her. But Janey did not begrudge Edith this... No one should grow up the way she had done. The way Thomas seemed to have done. And he seemed to have loved Edith despite all this... Why else would he have saved her from his sister? Janey wasn't sure if she could still love humans. They only seemed to hurt each other. Mrs Worthington had been different though... and Edith too. But, in general, Janey hated people getting too close to her. She kept her distance, even if that made her seem cold and heartless. Here, though, was a man abandoned. And he touched her, somehow. Edith needn't have worried about Janey – Janey had wanted to help Thomas from the moment he had entered the kitchen. She had seen the fear in his face and his hopelessness – she recognised it. It had touched a nerve in her, something she had hidden so deep within herself that she did not think it would ever resurface. But it had. She wasn't running away, though; she could help him – and would. Starting with finding him something to wear. She began to pull clothes from the closet, but she had trouble finding something clean enough and, especially wearable. On close inspection, the clothes were incredibly threadbare. She continued looking, but every piece of clothing was the same. Around the room, she saw other signs of neglect. Again, it had not been cleaned, or even tidied, and absolutely everything was threadbare, from the curtains, to the carpet, to the blankets on his bed. He had to be cold in winter, because these did very little in warming him. He was rich, Janey knew – his invention had made a fortune. Edith had said he did not want it, but to live in poverty like this... It had to be set right. Not golden taps... But a real bathroom, new clothes, new furniture. Not a mansion, even though he could afford it – just a comfortable, cozy home. The one thing this room had no shortage of was books, which seemed cruel for a man that could not see. Maybe Mrs Allsop had been meant to read them to him but, seeing she had not done any other chores, Janey thought it unlikely she had read to Thomas. Well, that would change as well. She would make a list of all the things that needed changing and make sure they would get done. The cottage itself was sound, and in fact quite lovely. It was build in red bricks with large windows that let in the light. The room that was Thomas's life in fact contained two decent reception rooms, each with their own fireplace. There were beautiful details throughout the house – elaborate ceilings, cornices, stained glass windows – they had just been neglected. If the place was done up again, it would make the most lovely, cozy home, even for a blind man. But that was for later She would need Thomas's permission for that, and she would start to work on that as soon as he was done in the tub. She knew she could probably do it anyway without his permission – if she asked Edith for the money, she was sure she would get whatever she needed – but it was time he was put back in charge of his own life. She hung his fresh clothes on the pegs and then looked back at him... The foam had gone and she had a very good look at the male anatomy. Better than she had ever had before in her life. A blush rose to her cheeks... He must have heard her.\"Janey... Are you there?\" \"Yes,\" she said, even more startled. She needed to pull herself back together. If she was going to work for a man that was blind, then were probably going to be times that she would see him naked, seeing he could not see where she was. Plus, there might be times he needed her help in... awkward situations. It wasn't like he was threatening or repulsive... In fact, it was giving her other feelings that she had no idea what to do with. And then she saw the scars. After all this time, they were still red and menacing. She knew what had caused them. Edith bore her own scars from that day, Janey knew, but if they were as raw as these... They looked as if it had just happened. Alright, she had to snap out of this. \"I hung your clothes up for when you are done. How are you feeling?\" He smiled. \"Like I'm human again.\" Princess PrettyPants : He has done redemption, now let's hope he finds salvation (wait, I'm in charge of that, ain't I?) smithsbabe65 : Don't worry I sometimes get tears in my eyes writing it too.. Or goosebumps... I'm a sap. But the hair cutting just seemed a moment to share intimacy without it being strange. Some hairdressers can be rough so it was the moment to show her opposite behaviour. And yes, all will be well with Pilot. I don't even like dogs, especially big ones but I have taken a shine to him Nibaloo: Yes it is Thomas x OC TheRealTayler13 : Alright, alright...[Chapter 8] With Janey taking care of him, Thomas started to realise he had not deserved the way Mrs Allsop had treated him. She had made his life miserable, abused him and stolen from him – and the money she had stolen had now been taken by the villagers. He did not feel bad that they had taken the money. The kitchen silver was a different matter, though. It had come from his home – from Allerdale. It had been his last link to that place, besides the scars... Perhaps it was for the best – his home was cursed. All the memories that came from there were tainted with pain and blood. Janey had replaced anything that was stolen, and more. He probably didn't deserve Janey either, but for opposite reasons. He had landed in heaven and he felt happy – truly happy – for the first time, without a dark threatening cloud hanging over him. He knew he had not earned it to be this blessed, but Janey gave him little time to think about it. She had gone like a whirlwind through the house, cleaning and redecorating. It was like a cloud had been lifted. The first day she had started, she had gone upstairs with him and somehow had gotten him to agree to move his bedroom up here. It had proven a great decision – there was so much room, now. Over the next few days, she had gotten builders and a plumber in to make two bedrooms and a bathroom. His bed and closet had been moved upstairs, while she furnished the other bedroom for herself. Downstairs, he now had of course the kitchen, but also a dining room he could not remember visiting, and his old rooms were turned into a sitting room and a library. Five years before, Edith had sent him some of his possessions from Allerdale Hall when he moved here and had included lots of books from the library. Thomas hated those books – to him, the library represented the worst of his and Lucille's punishments. Edith loved books, though, and so did Janey. The library here though was nothing like his father's. Yes, the walls were lined with books, but the smell was completely different. His father's library had smelled of old cigars. Here, it smelt of fresh flowers that Janey changed every few days. Every inch of the house had been cleaned, and it was like it had come to life. He had helped Janey in getting the rooms in order. Unlike Mrs Allsop, Janey liked getting him involved in as many tasks as possible. So, when she was cleaning, she got him to do tasks that could be done by touch only, like polishing a table or dusting off all the books. She would make sure nothing was in the way and trust him to it when he started to tackle harder jobs. He had a constant companion to look out for him, though. Pilot would sit by him and keep him safe. The first time the big dog had pulled him back, keeping him from bumping into a table full of glass objects, Thomas had been startled; but, since then, he had learned to rely on the dog, and even had started to like the massive beast. There was plenty time for fun, too. Together, all three of them went on large walks in the afternoon – rain or shine. Janey would take him by the arm and lead him round any obstacles that came on their path. He loved it – the feeling of freedom, of being outdoors. So much of his life had been spent indoors – his parents did not like him and his sister getting dirty, 'like the rabble in the village' as they said. Janey didn't mind – if he got dirty, she just got him to change. She had only raised her voice once to him – he had been standing so close to the stove that she feared his sleeve would catch fire – and then she had pulled him back. He could tell that it had scared her more than it had him, as she stood panting beside him, arms around him to hold him safe. Though startled, he had been moved that she had cared so much about his well-being. Surprisingly, even after that incident, she had not banned him from the kitchen. In fact, she encouraged him to help there too, having him peel and grate vegetables. It was not like Janey was lazy – she bustled around him as he was working away, and together they made dinner. It was so nice to be useful again. To do something... Anything. To know he could still perform simple tasks and that he was getting better and better at them. He could walk through the house now without having to feel his way along the wall and without bumping into things. It gave him back his dignity. In the evening, she would pick out a book, and read to him as they sat by the fire. Her voice was light and melodious, and the stories beautiful. He had not realised that he had owned such novels, books that were not sordid and dark. He started to wonder what else was in his library, and prayed to God Edith had not packed some of the horrible books that had belonged to his father. Tonight, though, there would be something different. A parcel had arrived earlier that day, and Janey had said she would look at it after dinner. Many parcels had arrived in the last few weeks, containing household items, furniture and clothes for him. He had the money, so he should look after himself, Janey had said. It made him wonder how much Mrs Allsop had taken from him over the years... how much the villagers had taken. He had not told Janey about the money he had found on the table as Mrs Allsop had died. Janey clearly spent every penny on him, making his life better. He started to wonder whether he should tell her to buy something for herself as well. Maybe she had. There had been something in her voice recently, like she was not telling him something. It didn't sound malicious, though, so he didn't worry. If she had bought something for herself with his money, well, she had certainly earned it. She had been quietly tinkering with something for the last half hour, not saying anything, and he was getting curious. Suddenly he heard music – Chopin. \"Yes!\" Janey cheered. \"It works!\" \"What is that?\" Thomas asked, confused. He had not heard Chopin since... \"I bought a gramophone player. So you can do more than just listen to boring old me read to you.\" \"But I love it when you read to me,\" he protested. \"That's very kind of you. But I thought you might like a change, though.\" \"It's been a long time since I heard music. My sister liked to play. I usually danced. Waltzed.\" His best memories were from when he was dancing. Edith... Why were there so few happy memories to choose from? \"Don't let me stop you.\" He could hear Janey was grinning. She was challenging him. Two could be that clever. \"What do you mean? Dance? But I can't even see where I'm going. And I need a partner.\" \"I can't dance,\" she protested. \"Never learned how... never even went to a country dance.\" \"That's a shame... Alright, then. Come here, if you dare. I'll teach you to dance, as long as you keep us from bumping into things. Deal?\" \"Deal.\" She placed her hand in his, and another on his shoulder. He beamed. How could life possibly have turned out this good after all? Sparky She-Demon : A corner has been turned for him, now it's up to him Princess PrettyPants : Janey is a good woman, she takes care of him. Sallydanz13 : Glad you like it. Smithsbabe65 : And I am loving your reviews. Your feelings are matching mine as I write it, and I love that you are enjoying this so much... Though I did almost choke on your mention of the assets, ROFL They are in fact quite...charming, lol Guest : Thank you[Chapter 9] Thomas was a wonderful dancer. Well, as far as Janey could tell... she had never danced in her life. That intimate contact with a man... it wasn't something she had ever wanted. People were safer at a distance. Still... It had been wonderful. They had bumped into the couch... and the coffee table... but it hadn't mattered. For the first time, she had seen him blossom, truly blossom, and seen a side of him she didn't know existed. Strong, but without being overbearing. He had taken the lead and twirled her around the room. It had been... magical. Most days weren't so easy, though. He needed her help – not so much physically as emotionally. She had never met a man this lost. Many people were lost, but most hid that loss behind a mask of arrogance. Not Thomas, though. It was all out in the open and gut wrenching, which left him open for abuse, just as had happened with Mrs Allsop. In some ways, she admired his forgiveness – most people that had been through what he had would blame the world, growing terribly bitter. Thomas wasn't bitter – he didn't blame anyone, although life had been horrible to him. He blamed only himself. That had led to inertia, and he had let himself be abused... Because he thought he deserved it, perhaps. She had not asked, and they had not talked about it, but it was clear he was trying to punish himself. Each time she tried to help him, tried to do something fun for him, his initial reaction would be to refuse. When she asked him to go on a walk with her the first time, he said he would only slow her down. When she first had started reading to him, he had told her not to make a fuss for him. She had easily changed his mind but it was clear that he tried to avoid happiness. Knowing what had happened, she understood why... But she wasn't sure how to breach the subject. He did not know that she knew, and she wasn't sure how to tell him or if she should even tell him. If he felt so much guilt already, what would he be like if he knew she knew? He was making improvements and that was all that mattered. Janey had never thought she would be this comfortable living with a man, but she and Pilot had fit right in. She had felt at home here in a matter of days. Thomas was not threatening, unlike so many men. He went along with everything she said... which wasn't right of course, but she was very careful not to abuse this gentle nature. Yes, she let him help with dinner, but this was more to keep him busy and give him independence in case he needed it. He had told her a little bit about how Mrs Allsop had treated him, basically not allowing him to do anything, not even move. He had been a prisoner, not just of his blindness, but from her behaviour as well. Janey would not let that happen again. It was why she had pushed him to change his living arrangements in this manner. First of all, it was his house, and he deserved to enjoy his life in it, not be a prisoner in one room. But also it was more accessible to him this way. He had the money – in fact, he was a millionaire. He just had refused to use the money. It was another sign of him punishing himself, she thought. Like he did not deserve happiness and living the good life. Janey would have none of it, though. So, she had bought him everything he needed. Thomas had given his purse strings to Edith, and Edith now had given them to her. She was a bit cross with her friend that she had never gone to check up on Thomas. So much pain could have been spared for him. Edith had told her how much she had paid Mrs Allsop, a wage now Janey got, and it was a handsome salary, even when you did not count 'expenditures', which came in addition to the salary. All together, it was about 700 pounds a year, but Mrs Allsop had not spent a penny on Thomas. It made Janey furious. She had no particular respect for the rich, those born with a silver spoon in their mouth, that behaved like they were superior to everybody. But Thomas was not like that and, according to Edith, he never had been. Mrs. Allsop had been the villain here. Of course, most of her possessions had been stolen by the villagers, and the money too probably. A stash of it had been put in the one place no one had dared look: the old woman's mattress. Janey had used it to pay the locksmith and the workers. Thomas now had a good room to sleep in, and Janey was right next door when he needed her. Not that he needed her much – with a little help, he was more than capable of doing things himself. She knew the work she was doing might in time make him so independent that he would not need her any more. He was young, unlike Mrs Withington, who had needed Janey's help not just because she had lost her sight but also because she was getting on in years. Thomas would in time fully adapt to being blind, especially since he was doing so well already. All she really needed to do was lay out his clothes... and sit by him when he had nightmares. Well, she did not have to, but when she heard him cry in terror in the middle of the night, it pierced right through her heart. There was such pain in that cry. The first night she heard it, she had been frozen with fear for a moment. Pilot, however, had not been, and had immediately crawled into bed with Thomas, who was still sleeping downstairs in his old room at that point. Janey sat with them, and a little while later she could see that, although Thomas hadn't woken up, he had relaxed. However, now Thomas had moved to the upstairs rooms, and Pilot was not allowed upstairs – the old boy was getting on in years, and walking up stairs was no good for his joints. So, now she would simply get up when she heard Thomas call out and then sit with him until he calmed down. He would sleep right through it, so she had no idea if it helped, but he would not complain of bad dreams the next morning... Than again, he did not complain much at all. He was beautiful when he slept, a raven angel, despite the scar. She could stare at him for hours... Which was wrong of course. But he did something to her. She liked being around him, which was … impossible, almost. She didn't trust people in general, but men especially – men only stood for violence in her book. When she had first agreed to the job, she had not been planning to stay for long. Frankly, she had only intended to get him back on his feet and then hire someone else to take care of him. She could not have seen herself serving a man for years to come, no matter how gentle and meek Edith said his character was. Janey knew abuse, and how it changed you. His gentle nature was even more surprising because of it. Not one bad word had come from him so far. No bitterness... just guilt. She didn't want to leave him now. She loved being around him. As he became less shy, it turned out he had a brilliant mind to boot. They talked on their walks about poetry and literature. This man... He gave her jitters. \"Isn't it about time for Pilot's walk?\" he asked gently. \"It's pouring out there... I'm hoping it'll clear up a little bit in a minute.\" \"Well, that's what umbrellas are for.\" He pulled the umbrella from the stand, knowing exactly where it was. It filled her with a sense of pride that he had come that far in such a short period. Pilot immediately rushed to him, hearing the sound of 'walkies'. Both of them were looking at her expectantly. How could she undermine such determination, not to mention the puppy dog eyes from both of them. \"Alright you two, let me just get my scarf.\" Thomas beamed at her. Butterflies fluttered through her stomach as she took his arm, and she shivered involuntarily. \"Are you sure you are warm enough? You can always borrow my jacket, if you want,\" Thomas offered. \"I'll be fine,\" she assured him, patting his arm. She would be. As soon as she got these feelings under control. Esmem83976: That's why I started writing this … I get what Thomas' sacrifice represents... But I don't like it. So he lives! CrimsonKitsune333: Errrrrmmm errr... You're psychic? Got some chapters to go before that though. And it only will be a little hiccup Princess PrettyPants: Yay, confetti! I'm sure Pilot loves that. *Imagines a big dog jumping in confetti* Smithsbabe65: You know, I don't even like dogs, but I felt the story needed one somehow needed Pilot. And I have fallen in love with him... I already was in love with Thomas... Cute puppy Nibaloo: I try to update regularly, I promise. IluffsNicoDiAngelo: Thank you I have written a Loki Advent poem, but I am posting that in parts on twitter. So if you want to check it out check out: TomsKnittedTie is my name... (and you can find out the full extent of my madness (you've been warned)[Chapter 10] Janey... She was like an angel from head to toe. She lit up the room, even though he lived in complete darkness – her kindness radiated through. She took care of him... better than even his own sister had. Lucille had taken care of him... But some days she could be cruel and mean. Some days, she would even hurt him – she was a master at inflicting pain without leaving marks. He had still loved her though, despite of what she had done. He knew the pain she had been through, and he had always felt guilty. Much of her pain had been because of him – things he had done, for which she had taken the blame. But he now also started to see how his sister had goaded him into doing things – forced him, even – often things he did not want to do. Even when they had been little, she had made him do things that he knew were forbidden. Sometimes unjustly so.o. The toys... It had been a cruel move by their father not to let them play with them. But they had... And they were caught. Or rather, Lucille was caught – he had hidden away. But it had been Lucille's idea to go there in the first place, even though she later had said it was his fault they were there. It was the first thrashing that he could remember... and the start of his inventing career. Lucille kept wanting to go back to the toy room, but Thomas had been too afraid to let his sister get hurt again. So he started creating things, trying to replicate the toys they had seen in order to keep his sister away from that damned room. It had been the start of his inventing career. Of course, Lucille soon had found other ways to defy their parents. Looking back on it, it was almost like she relished it... She wore every lash like a battle scar. If anything, every beating made her even more determined to defy their parents. That had been part of the reason he had gone along with her plans so easily. If anything, he knew that, when defied, Lucille hit back twice as hard. Convincing her Edith was the better choice had been his first act of real defiance. If only he hadn't... Lucille might still be alive... But some other girl would have died... He realised that too. He could not help missing his sister, though. Lucille had been so much part of… him. The sudden realisation came to him that he and Lucille had been like one person all along. He had been the human face, the one that tried to put everything right, to please people. He had tried to please their mother and father by being exactly what they wanted – invisible. Lucille had been everything he did not dare to be – but, with that, she had lost her humanity. She never cared who got hurt. In fact, she derived pleasure in seeing the pain of others. She had nursed their mother because she had liked \"seeing the old hag in pain\", she would tell him at night when they lay in bed together. The delight she had shown in it gave him chills. He had known it was wrong, but at the same time he had thought their mother deserved it. Never had their mother expressed kindness to them. He hadn't felt sad when she died... nor when his father died. They had deserved it. His sister confirmed this, or rather, she had constantly convinced him of this fact. When his first wife died, it had been a relief... Had sadness touched him? Not really. With the second... Well he realised what Lucille had done and he was mortified … but not about his wife... About himself, and how he had not stopped it. Still, he had let Lucille bully him into taking a third wife... And a fourth. All the times he could have objected, and yet... Why hadn't he? Lucille would have been furious, yes. She might have hurt him. But it would have been the right thing to do. And she might have still been alive now. In an asylum, yes, but he would have found her one where they treated her gently. Maybe he would have stayed with her, too. God knew he was far from sane. But then again, where would they have found the money? All they would have been able to afford was some second-rate quack who would have made matter worse. Lucille would have probably bludgeoned him, and turned him into mince pies. That image made him laugh... and immediately he felt guilty. How could he laugh about someone dying, even if it was just a hypothetical person? Maybe Lucille was right – maybe he was wicked. Maybe he was just as crazy as she was. How couldn't he be, with those genes? Mother had been cold and cruel, and his father an ill-tempered hot head that coud blow up over nothing. He was their spawn, as was Lucille. How could he be anything but bad? How could he care for anyone? Still.. He knew what love was... Didn't he? He cared deeply for Janey. He couldn't imagine ever hurting her. He'd rather die than seeing her get hurt. Even though he had only known her for a short period of time, he had grown very fond of her... Very fond... Why she would stay with a broken man like him, though, he did not understand. He still loved Edith, in his own way... though the passion was gone. She had shown him the way to the light, and he would have gladly joined her there, only the hold of the darkness had been too strong. She had been right in saying he was tied to the past, and his past was so dark that it had him in a hold...even to this day, he could not get rid of it and he probably never would. He had loved Lucille. He still couldn't come to face with the fact she was dead... Their relationship had been twisted in so many ways, but all he had ever wanted to do was protect her, make her feel safe, feel loved in a way their parents never had. It had all become so muddled up, though. So much so that she had tried to kill him... And very nearly succeeded. And yet... he still loved her, he still cared for her. He forgave her for what she had done. He understood. And that worried him. How? Someone who had done such evil things? He would have let her gotten away with worse if Edith had not stopped him. And if that did not make him certifiable, he didn't know what would. He wondered if in time he would hurt Janey... He never had hurt anyone, but... With his genes, could he take the risk? What had made his parents the way they were? Lack of love? Isolation? There had been so much anger... He couldn't understand. He just felt pain... A hand was laid on his shoulder. \"Would you like to come with me to the village? It's a lovely day, and I would like the company.\" No... There was nothing there for him. The villagers hated him. He was a monster that they should ban from society. But had he not been hiding long enough? Was it not that, which had driven his parents over the edge, and Lucille as well. In company she could be carming but alone.. The demons had come out. Maybe he should go out there. Maybe it was time to stop being afraid of everything. Maybe by going out there, he could change his destiny, not becoming a bitter recluse like his parents. \"Alright... let's go.\" ILuffsNicoDiAngelo : I'm glad you do Angel Flying: Thank you Smithsbabe65: Yup, I'd jump his bones to and freak him out. Thank heavens Janey is more patient. And Pilot... He is going nowhere Sallydanz13 : Thank you[Chapter 11] Thomas was doing much better - but sometimes he would suddenly just cloud over for no particular reason. Janey could only imagine what he was thinking about, as his face would turn dark and sad. She wanted to put her arms around him, but that was not proper behaviour, was it? So instead she would pull him out of it by doing something else. Like a walk. She had planned to go to the village herself this afternoon, leaving Thomas on his own, but on second thought perhaps it was better if he came with her, than sit here by himself. So she had invited him along, and now they were slowly making their way to the village. It was a route they had never taken before so progress was not very fast. But that was fine. The weather was lovely, and he seemed to be enjoying himself, although he looked a bit apprehensive. She couldn't blame him. Last time he had met the villagers, they had not exactly been friendly. But that wasn't all of them. By keeping her ear to the ground she had a pretty good knowledge of who had taken advantage of him. And they were no longer supplying Mr Sharpe. She had found better, sometimes even cheaper suppliers, that were honest and kind. In case anyone did try to hurt them, Pilot was there. Thomas and the dog really had gotten attached to each other. Pilot was happy he had someone to guide again, and Thomas was happy someone was looking out for him. The only thing Janey needed to worry about was Pilot getting fat from too many treats. Lastly, he looked in nothing like the savage they had seen last time. His hair was now decent, he was looking clean and very smart. He was dressed in new clothes, not the threadbare rags he had owned. Janey had gotten him a new wardrobe which was functional, fashionable and made him look an utter gentleman. Beside the fact he was blind - and that wasn't really that noticeable either if you didn't know - there was no reminder of the man she had first seen. \"We are here,\" Thomas suddenly said. He was right, they had just passed the first house.\"Yes, how do you know?\" \"I hear people's voices, and we are walking on pavement rather than a dirt path.\" \"Indeed. Well done.\" She was amazed at how well he had adapted. He was nervous though, the grip on her arm had tightened. \"What are we here for?\" \"Well, I need to go to the post office and the haberdasher's for some ribbons an thread to mend my dresses. And it's market day.\" She softly rubbed his hand, trying to calm him. It seemed to work. As he smiled. \"You know we could buy you a new dress. Or two. You bought me an entire new wardrobe,\" he suddenly offered. She blushed at his generosity. \"With your own money, Thomas. I am here to take care of you, and that is what I did. You needed those clothes. Your old ones were so worn they were practically see-through.\" \"Well, that does not mean I can't buy you a dress as a thank you.\" He almost looked hurt. \"I appreciate it, but it really isn't necessary. I can mend and make do,\" she assured him. \"I'd be happy to...\" he protested. \"But it would not be right. You pay me quite handsomely, you know. I can more than make do with that. So if I need anything I will buy myself. You don't need to worry...\" She didn't want to take advantage of him. That had happened enough. The had arrived at the post office, where she had a letter for Edith to post. She gave her weekly updates of ho Thomas was doing, as well as personal things. Though lately she had been holding back. She had no trouble talking about Thomas well-being, but when it came to their relationship, and how she felt about Thomas... It just was weird. By liking one, it was like she was betraying the other. She knew Edith no longer had feelings for him... besides pity and Janey found that rather unfair. Yes, she felt a certain amount of pity for Thomas, but she admired him even more for staying so kind and caring. Edith saw a weak man... But he was not... Not if you considered the burdens he had to carry. Most people would have crumbled under that and grown bitter. Janey had... It took a very special and patient personality to change that. And Thomas was that person. Janey found herself more mild in her judgments because of him. She left Thomas for a moment on a bench to handle her affairs both at the post office as well as the haberdashery. He and Pilot seemed perfectly happy sitting in the sun as she joined them again. No one had bothered them, though a few girls were looking at the handsome stranger they had not seen before. She heard them whisper, and had to bite her cheek not to giggle. \"Are you boys coming with me?\" she smiled. \"Of course.\" He let his arm slip into hers, and to the outside world they looked just like a normal couple going for a stroll. Well, as long as you did not listen to their conversation too closely, which mainly involved her talking about the obstacles in the road ahead of them. It was a lot harder than it was at home, because she also needed to look out for traffic. \"Can you wait here a minute whilst I buy some fruit?\" Navigating between the crowds at the stall was going to be difficult enough without having him to worry about. So she left the pair of them waiting on the corner as she went across the street to get what she needed. Suddenly a carriage came crashing right through the crowd... Heading directly at Thomas. She saw him look bewildered, he could hear it, but had no idea in which direction to turn. People were brushing past him, which unsettled him even more. Instead of moving with them he was stepping into the road, whilst Pilot was pushed back by the mass of people, and couldn't help him. The carriage just pushed ahead not caring who was in the way. Could nobody see Thomas? Dropping her groceries, Janey ran across the road to pull him out of the way. As she did, she clipped her heel... Princess PrettyPants: Yay, you noticed! Yes it seemed a befitting to give a wink to Sweeney Todd. Smithsbabe65: Thomas is still very much connected to his past, mostly because he feels guilty of for his own crimes. So I don't think he will be over it soon. CrimsonKitsune333 : Thank you darling Samantha Michaelis : Glad you like it Elsie girl: There is more, I hope you like it Esmem83976 : I got my ending planned, don't worried.[Chapter 12] It all happened in slow motion, much like it had when his sister had stabbed him, only this time he couldn't see it happening. There had been a swelling sound of rattling wheels, as people started to brush past him. They were so rough though that he lost his sense direction. He franticly tried to recompose himself, but the crowd spun him around several times until he no longer knew which direction he was facing, or where Janey had gone. He felt himself slip off the pavement as the sound of wheels kept rushing towards him. Suddenly someone grabbed him and he was pushed. They took a few steps and tumbled. There was an anguished scream. Janey! She was on top of him but obviously in pain. Stupid idiot that he was, she had obviously tried to save him, and now she was hurt instead. Silly girl. He would rather have died, than let her get harmed. A crowd gathered round, he could tell by the way the voices gathered round them. Once more he was the center of attention. Previous encounters with such gatherings always resorted in misery. The quicker they got out of here, the better. \"Maniac!\" someone yelled, and he winced before realising it had been said in the direction of the retreating wheels in the distance, and not him. Janey was moaning, and he tentatively searched for her, gathering her in his arms. \"Are you alright?\" \"My ankle...\" she groaned. \"Why didn't you step aside, sir?\" someone asked in the crowd. \"Because he is blind,\" Janey bit back. He could hear the strain in her voice ,and he felt nervous. He was fine, besides a hard impact on the stones, but he could tell she she wasn't. She was trying to get up, but each time she tried, she cried out in pain, and sank back. He needed to be strong though. For once in his life, For her. \"Janey, calm down, it is going to be alright.\" Gingerly he got to his feet. No lasting damage except a few sores that would probably turn into bruises later it felt like, and since he wouldn't be able to see them anyways, it didn't matter. \"Where does it hurt Janey?\" \"My ankle. I think the carriage ran over it. It twisted. Ouch.\" \"Anywhere else... Your head?\" \"No, I fell into you... Are you alright? Did you slam your head into the pavement. I shouldn't have left you there,\" she started to apologise. \"I'm fine. Put your arms around my neck.\" She did, and as he gathered her in his arms, lifting her up in his arms. As he got up, he could feel Pilot brush up against his leg. There was a soft bark from the dog, to let Thomas know he was there. At least the dog seemed ok. \"Thomas, what are you doing? Put me down!\" she protested immediately. \"I'm carrying you, and I'm not putting you down, because you are obviously in pain. Now could someone point us in the direction of a doctor please... This lady needs medical attention.\" He had no idea how he was gonna do this, but he was not going to let her down. The crowd was still gathered round them, and he silently prayed that for once they wouldn't turn against him. \"I'm fine Thomas, let's just go home...\" Janey whispered in his ear. But he couldn't. She was not fine, she was hurt, and somebody needed to look at it. \"What is going,\" an authoritative voice asked. \"Good afternoon officer. I got hurt by the carriage that came through here...\" Janey softly spoke. She was curled up against his chest, clinging to him. It made the blood rush through his veins rush a little faster. He berated himself. Her hurt should not feel this good. A woman from the crowd started speaking. \"It was what maniac from Thorsbrock Hall that ran them over, he did. That man is a menace... He didn't even stop! He will kill somebody one day, I tell you. He nearly ran my daughter over the other day. \" The others seemed to agreed with her as far as Thomas could tell by their murmurs. It didn't matter much to him at the moment. The only thing he cared about was the woman in his arms. She was being brave, but he could tell she was hurting by the way she was clinging to him. At least she was conscious though. \"Sir, my... Janey hurt her ankle. The coach ran her over as she tried to push me out of the way. She needs medical help.\" \"Alright... Come with me sir,\" the police man said and started to walk away as far as Thomas could tell. \"Officer, he is blind, he can't see where you are going,\" Janey protested. \"What?\" the man asked confused. \"I... Was stabbed... a few years ago, and I lost my sight.\" It was the first time he had said it out loud, and it stung more than he liked to think about at this moment. \"Janey explained to me that I still automatically look at a sound as an automatic reaction, even though I am blind. But even though I may look at you that doesn't mean I see anything.\" The police man walked over bruskly, Thomas could tell by the creaking off his boots. \"Alright... Get away you mutt!\" Pilot growled defensively. \"No, Pilot I with us!... Down boy, it's alright, this man is gonna help us. Stay close and guide me,\" Thomas commanded the dog. He needed Pilot more than he needed the police officer at this moment. Pilot barked as if he understood. He probably did. That dog was a genius. The officer sighed, he probably had enough of them already. \"Take my... I'll take your arm, and if you follow me, we will get your wife some help.\" \"She isn't...\"Oh what did it matter, as long as they got help. It wasn't proper to carry Janey like he was out of wedlock, but what did he care for convention. \"Lead the way.\" The doctor was more accommodating and took them right into his office. Although... He wanted to send Thomas away. Janey would have none of it. \"I want him here.\" \"But madam, it's not proper! You will need to undress...\" \"Just my ankle I trust, I won't be stripping any further. Doctor or not. I'm stripping for no man. And besides that, he can't see it anyways. He stays.\" Thomas smiled. Janey was obviously starting to feel better, if she was starting to sound so fierce. \"Alright, but the dog stays outside. I'm not a vet!\" the doctor bristled. \"Stay Pilot,\" Thomas said, patting the dog on the head, before joining Janey in the doctor's office. As the doctor took off her shoe, he heard Janey gasp in pain. He automatically sought her hand and she squeezed it hard, refusing to let out another squeak. He heard her laboured breath though as the doctor examined her ankle. \"It's not broken, but severely sprained. You must not stand on it for the next few weeks and if the pain doesn't stop, or worsens , come back to me... I will bandage it now to keep down the swelling.\" \"Fine,\" Janey sighed. Thomas wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her, but he realised he couldn't. If anyone found out they weren't married... He did not want to cause her any more scandal. \"Madam. I should really be checking all of you. Your corset may have shifted, and you might be hurt without knowing it, \" the doctor tried to convince her. \"I don't wear a corset. I find them nonsense. So don't worry, I am fine. A scrape on my palm, and a tear in my dress. That's all,\" Janey said. \"So you are one of those women..\" the doctor said. Thomas did not like his tone. Neither did Janey. \"What kind of woman is that?\" \"A suffragette.\" There was disgust in his voice. \"Oh no, sir. I won't suffer by the hand of anyone... Especially a man,\" she spat at him. \"Now are you done, sir?\" The man was obviously shaken by such a candid answer. \"Y-y-yes,\" he stammered. Thomas fought a grin. That was his Janey. \"Let's go home,\" he said gathering her up in his arms again. It's a bit faster than I had planned, but I got so many complaints/requests that I couldn't leave you on a clffhanger... So here it is! CrimsonKitsune333, Esmem83976, Samantha Michaelis, Smithsbabe65 & Guest: I get it... I left you on a cliff hanger. Sorry (Though, to be fair, I'm probably gonna do it again) Esmem83976: Janey did not have an easy life, we will learn more about that soon. Smithsbabe65: You don't honestly think I would hurt her that badly, would you? I think Thomas is finding his strength though, rather than getting weaker.[Chapter 13] Thomas had carried her in his arms all the way home, despite her protests. The journey home had gone amazingly well, she had to admit. Despite the fact he was blind, despite she knew she wasn't exactly light he had insisted on carrying her home. She was happy to be away from that overbearing doctor, but she realised halfway through that she should have insisted on finding another method to get home. He hadn't complained once though, not even sighed, though his breath had gotten more and more laboured as they went along. He wouldn't give up though, not even when she had urged him to sit down and take a break. He wouldn't put her down either... She was sure she could have hopped along with his support for part of the journey, but he wouldn't hear of it. And she also had to admit, she liked it. Despite everything, the pain in her leg, the fact he was a man that was holding her very intimately... the fact he was her employer which she didn't even want to think about, because this was wrong on so many levels... she had never felt safer cradled in his arms. It was strange... and wrong... and yet. When the police officer had her Thomas' wife, and Thomas had not objected, but held her closer instead, it did something to her. She had always been determined to be a strong independent woman, and yet today she has easily given into Thomas' ready arms. He had been so sweet and kind to her though... And strict, which surprised her. But it wasn't malicious. Just by no means would he let her stand on her feet for even a second. When they got home he had immediately offered her to make a cup of tea, but she had ordered him to sit down and get his breath back first. \"You have done great. Thank you,\" she said, grabbing his hand. \"It was my fault you got hurt in the first place. I should have taken better care.. I'm sorry.\" Poor Thomas, of course he would blame himself. \"No it was my fault. I shouldn't have left you in the middle of the street where the crowd could push you around. You don't look blind, on the face of it it's like nothing is wrong with you, so people don't take in account they should be careful. I should have been the one to realise that, not you.\" She could kick herself for being so stupid. \"Still, I'm sorry you got hurt. And I will do anything to make it up to you,\" he promised. Now she felt even more guilty. He would do anything he could for her, she realised. \"You don't have to. You're the master, and I am the servant, remember. Perhaps we should get some extra help in for the moment. I won't be able to do much.\" He immediately shook his head. \"No, we'll manage. I can do what is needed as long as you are my eyes. I don't like the idea of strangers poking round here... \" If she was honest, neither was she. \"Alright. We shall see how it goes. But promise me you will be careful. I don't want you to get hurt.\" \"I will do anything you say, \" he promised gently. But then his face changed. \"Janey, I got to know. You are really not wearing a corset?\" It confused her. What was he asking? \"And why would you need to know that? Are you gonna judge me like the doctor did?\" \"No! I don't care of you are a suffragette or not... Which doesn't mean I do not care about that cause... I think women should be equal... But you seemed very determined to get rid of the man. Please tell me you didn't do that at the expense of your own health?\" He looked so worried. She smiled. … of course. This was Thomas. All he cared about was her safety. He really had no idea how special he was. \"I'm really not wearing a corset.\" \"Promise?\" he asked again. She grabbed his hands and put them round her. It was a wicked thing to do, not proper at all, and she knew it. \"Does it feel like I'm wearing a corset. Do you feel any bones?\" He blushed a deep crimson. It was kind of cruel of her to do so. But his hands felt so good on her. She had never even considered letting a man close. Thomas was different though. She wanted him closer, and she couldn't quite explain it. But it wasn't right... \"I need to get some stuff, so if you don't mind...\" She tried to hop past him on one foot. \"Where do you think you are going?\" he asked, grabbing her by her waist. There was no fooling this blind man, he had very keen hearing. And he wasn't going to let her hurt herself. She needed to get out there though, and not just to clear her head.\"The garden.. I need to pick some herbs\" \"What do you need? I'll get it,\" he said ever so helpful. \"Comfrey. It will help heal the sprain. I'll need to find it myself, because I'm not sure where it grows...\" She wanted to go past him, but he swept her up in his arms again. This was getting ridiculous... Especially if she considered how good it felt. \"Thomas!\" \"Yes, madame. As you wish,\" he said, carrying her outside, and completely ignoring her protests. She sighed. \"Aren't you getting tired of carrying me around yet? I'm not exactly light.\" \"You're like a feather. And I'm fine. Now where to?\" he asked stepping outside. Janey looked around.\"I think there is a patch by the gate... Yes.. Put me down here.\" He didn't. He just kept holding her. It seemed he knew her too well already, and knew exactly how stubborn she was. And he was right... But if he insisted, she would listen. At her terms.\"Please. Just put me down on the ground. I promise I won't stand on my foot but it's growing among nettles. You can't do it without hurting yourself.\" He put her down ever so gentle and she crawled to the patch. \"I'll get you up when you need to. Do you need anything else? Scissors? A basket?\" he offered. Pilot, her other hero already came to her rescue. \"We are good... Aren't we Pilot?\" She cuddled the dog. Her two men... Alright, time to gather some herbs, the sooner this ankle was healed, the sooner things would be back to normal... Though it really wasn't that bad being carried around. No one had ever done such a a thing for her. She picked the comfrey leaves to make a foot bath later on. It would help her Thomas came and sit by them on the grass, letting the sun seep into his skin. It was like he was watching her, which of course wasn't possible. \"Yes, the rumours are true. I am a witch.\" She didn't know why she said it, it just came out. He sat up. \"What? Who says your a witch? Why would anyone say that? You are lovely.\" \"Loads of people, ever since I was little. I usually keep it under a bonnet, but have bright red hair you see, so I must be the devil's spawn.. I probably am...\" she said casually. She had stopped caring about what other people thought about her a long time ago. \"No you are not. You are the nicest woman I have ever met. You are not evil... Don't you ever think that of yourself, do you hear me?\" His speech had become so passionate that he was almost shaking. She had never seen him like this. Esmem83976: I would never hurt them... much Sparky She-demon: Yes Thomas is finding his groove. Princess Prettypants: Handsy? You mean pompous ass? :p Smithsbabe65: Without telling to much, yes, yes, he'll be fine, yes, sorta, but he cares to much to ask directly. Something will happen though that makes it all come out. Annie: Thank you. And thank you Isi for liking my LokiAdvent project \"The Frost Giant that Stole Christmas\" that is now complete and I also put the text on fanfiction.[Chapter 14] Thomas didn't know why it got to him so much, but it did. He didn't mind getting abuse, it barely even registered these days. Comparing to what his own family had done to him, what anyone else did to him was nothing. He carried the burden of the Sharpe name on a daily basis. The idea of anyone wanting to hurt Janey though... It stung. He wanted her happiness more than anything. And he certainly didn't want her to think ill of herself. He sought her shoulder. \"Janey, you are wonderful, do you hear me?\" \"Thomas, it's okay. Their words don't hurt me now. So what if they think I'm a witch? They give me a wide berth and I'm well rid of them. I really don't mind,\" she assured him. \"But I'm not. You don't deserve to be treated with contempt, certainly not over the color of your hair. You're so sweet.\" She grabbed his hand. \"And so are you. If the world doesn't want to see that, that's their problem. It doesn't bother me. I'm happy where I am right now... Here... Working for you. \" It made him wonder about the hardships she had been through. There was something she wasn't telling him, but he wasn't going to ask her. Nobody liked to be reminded of the darkness in their past, he knew that only too well. Poor Janey, she was so kind. She deserved better than being locked away in this house, with him, serving him for the rest of her day. Not that he wanted her to leave... \"You're not sick of working for me yet?\" \"No, if I was, I would go work somewhere else...\" Janey sounded strained as she said it... And then she cried out. \"Are you alright?\" he asked, crawling towards her. He had no clue what she had done exactly, just that something was wrong. She seemed to have fallen over, he found her foot, and then an arm. Gentle he tried to help her up, but accidentally touched her breast. \"Sorry.\" \"It's alright. I was stupid. I tried to pick a leaf out of reach, and fell over... I wasn't even standing up. Don't worry, I'm still in one piece... What do you want for dinner. Darn... I forgot the groceries in town. And the ribbons. Though my dress is ripped now. I will have to do a lot more mending than hide it with a ribbon. Maybe buy something new. Something practical.\" He heard the doubt in her voice. And something else... Insecurity. \"Something beautiful. I'll pay for it,\" he immediately offered. That seemed to upset her. \"No, I can pay for it. You don't need to trouble yourself. After all you are my employer... I get paid enough to take care of myself.\" But he want to be troubled. He wanted to take care of her, care for her. She deserves someone like that. Not him perhaps, but at least someone that was there for her. That loved her, \"There is more to life than work, you know...\" If Thomas had understood that sooner, lives may have been saved. \"Don't you want a family, a husband?\" \"I'm too plain and too opinionated to ever get a husband according to my mother,\" she put herself down again. Her statement had been very matter of fact. He raised his eyebrow. How could she think so little of herself? \"Is that so?\" \"She may be right. I don't want my life to be in servitude of a man.\" \"Unless you get paid for it.\" The words had slipped out before he knew it. She was so much more than just his maid... But it seemed that all he was to her was an employer. \"Yes, well... I have to make some money so I can live. I'm not some rich heiress that can just live off the wealth accumulated by my ancestors. This is my best shot at freedom. I can always quit here if I don't like your tone, and it is not like you are gonna demand marital relations from me... Are you?\" It was a very candid question that made him blush. \"It had not crossed my mind,\" he whispered. That wasn't quite true. Lately he thought more and more about kissing her. But why would she want to be with him? Especially if she knew the whole truth about him. No, he was gonna be single for the rest of his life. But she... She shouldn't be. She had too much love to give. \"Surely there must be someone out there that would love a fiery little sprite like you.\" \"To tame and break me, yes. I had several offers who all wanted to break my spirit along with several bones by the sound of it. And I'm not little. My mother says I'm like a weed, I was always taller than half of the boys in my village. I still am. It's horrendous,\" the pain in her voice was tangible now. Her mother was wrong. Yes, Janey was tall. And not exactly light as a feather, though he would carry her to the moon and back if need be... She deserved to be loved... in all the wonderful ways there were. \"Your mother sounds like quite an opinionated woman herself. And she seemed to have snagged herself a husband. Wouldn't you want that? You really think marriage is so awful?\" \"Do you want to get rid of me or something?\" she asked suspicious. \"Not at all. You have a very pleasant voice and you are...\" So worthy to be loved - He couldn't say that though... \"...much nicer than my previous maid. Despite your obvious misgivings about my gender, you treat me like a person, rather than an object, so I hope you will stay and work for me a long long time. Just... You deserve more than me. You deserve your happiness.\" \"Thank you...\" There was a deep sigh. \"To answer your question, my father was a drunk that liked to beat my mother and me for no reason, and there was nothing I could do about it. He died when I was ten but I will forever have his markings on my back. My mother acts like it never happened, but I want no other man to ever wield such power over me. So no, I plan on never marrying, if you don't mind.\" It cut him like a knife, to know she too had been hurt. And to make it worse, he had reminded her of this hurt. \"I'm truly sorry that happen to you. Humans can be cruel to one another for no reason it often seems. I promise you will be safe as long as you are here. After all, there is little to fear from a blind man.\" Janey kept quiet, and he couldn't decide if she was crying. He hoped not. He moved closer but wasn't sure what to do. Finally she spoke...\" That is very kind of you. Don't put yourself down though, you are more than your blindness. And what I see is a good man, that has been nicer to me than most people in my life have been.\" Thomas was quiet. Somehow being called nice hurt more than being called a monster. After all that was the truth... After all the horrible things he had done no one in their right mind would ever call him good.. She didn't know that however and the day she found out she would most likely leave. Finally he started stammering \"I.. I wasn't always... like this. It took for me to become blind to truly see...\" \"That is as poetic as it is sad.\" Her hand stroked his face. It was the first real gesture of human kindness since he had gotten since becoming blind, of comfort. Edith had not touched him after what happen, and he couldn't blame her. He had betrayed her in so many ways that he fully understood her wanting to have nothing to do with him. Janey had kindly taken care of him, but this was different. It was not jut his cheek she touched, but hi soul. A tear rolled down his face, and soon more followed. It was like a damn broke, he wasn't even sure what he was crying for, just all the misery seemed to pour out of him. Arms cradled him, and he pulled her closer as well. Their cheeks touched, tears were rolling down hers as well, he could feel the wetness, and he heard her sniff. \"Sorry,\" he whispered. She was the one that pulled it together. \"Listen mister, you really need to stop apologising for things that are not your fault, do you hear me.\" She hugged him tightly as she said it. It helped. \"Sor... Yes, ma'm. I'll try,\" he said forcing a smile. Esmem83976: Janey is just awesome, what can I say PrettyPris: Well Janey has some issues that make her crave independence Smithsbabe65: I was depending on you to get it, only the big blind oaf himself doesn't quit grasp it. I'm glad you liked my LokiAdvent, I hope you looked at it on twitter as well, with 25 delectable Loki pictures.[Chapter 15] Thomas was so fragile... And yet so strong. He had completely taken care of her the last two weeks. Carrying her wherever she wanted to go, being her legs, but also her hands, whenever she needed it. He did her all chores, under her strict supervision. She had been so worried he'd hurt himself, that she had insisted on being within sight when he did things, just in case he ran into trouble. She hadn't needed to. Everything had run perfectly, Thomas knew his way around the house now and he had even dealt with the tradesmen when they came with their deliveries. He had become more open to the outside world, talking to strangers without fear. In the morning, he would carry her down to breakfast and, in the evening, after she had read him his book, which was the only thing she could do for him right now, he would carry her back up again. He was so sweet, so kind – and he did it all without a single complaint. Never in her life had she been this well taken care of, by anyone. The day she had sprained her ankle, she had seen him break down, though. It was not uncommon for him to have dark moods but, up to that point, she had never seen him cry. It had been hard for her, too. The only one she had ever opened up to about her childhood so far had been Edith, and that had been in a letter, not face to face. That had been different – there had been no direct reaction, and she had been able to contain her emotions. With Thomas... she didn't know why she had told him. He had kept going on about how she should get married, and she had... snapped. She had never been happier than she was here with him. What she had considered impossible a year ago had happened – she felt utterly comfortable in the company of a man. So much so that she did not want to leave. So when he had told her she should find herself a husband... she had wanted none of it. She did want him, though. As he had cried in her arms, and she in his, she had wanted nothing more than to kiss him. And not just to comfort... She wanted love – passion – and everything that came with it. She wasn't sure what to do with those feelings. They were so alien to her. She had never been anything but repulsed when she looked at a man. To want to kiss him, to want to feel his hands on her body – that feeling was so strange, she hardly knew what to do. Besides... he was her employer. It wasn't right. And yet he was carrying her around like she was his princess, all with a smile on his face. She had tried to stop him, even though she loved the protective way he held her. But every time he did, she wanted him more, and it became hard to resist him. She was watching him now as he was cooking. He was doing fine and didn't need her help at all... It frightened her... What if indeed he decided he didn't need her? Still... she would not undermine his self-confidence to keep him down. She was so proud of him. Getting up, she took a small step to stand next to him. He immediately put an arm around her waist to support her. \"Hey, what are you doing here? That ankle needs rest.\" \"That ankle is is almost healed, by your tender love and care. It doesn't hurt any more when I stand on it.\" \"You shouldn't overdo it, though.\" He looked ready to carry her back to her seat. \"Like you would let me,\" she smiled. Dinner was ready, and they ate together. Rain was lashing against the window. Poor Thomas was going to have to walk Pilot later on in that weather. She would have to make sure he'd wrap up well. It was a pity she couldn't go with them. But Pilot would never let anything bad happen to Thomas. The silly dog had fallen completely for the blind guy... as had she. Her boys didn't stay out long. Janey had hardly even picked up her knitting needles before they came back in. It was really pouring down and even Pilot had found that it was no weather to be out and about. \"He pulled me right back in,\" Thomas said, brushing his coat off. \"Well, it does look pretty awful out there. Ready for some reading?\" she asked, putting her needles aside. \"Yes... we had finished our last book, hadn't we?\" \"We had... Do you want to pick a new book?\" \"But I can't see what I am picking.\" \"Well then, it will be a surprise for us both. Go ahead and pick one... Unless you want me to get up?\" she teased, knowing he would not let her get up. \"Alright, stay... I guess we can always pick another one if it's bad.\" There was a insecurity she couldn't place. \"Of course, just pick one.\" He came back and handed her the book. \"Interesting... Not sure if it's good for reading.\" Thomas fidgeted. Something was definitely wrong. \"Janey, my father's library had some books... They are not meant for tender eyes. If you find such a book, just burn it.\" She had no idea what he kind of book meant, but she doubted it was the he had just given her. \"Thomas, what are you talking about? I've got a book called The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla. \" \"Oh... Goodness. I always wanted read that but I never found the time. He is an amazing inventor – I admire him so much! Yes, please read it to me. I don't know if it will do me much good now that I'm blind, but... It would be amazing.\" It was great to see him excited. \"Gladly. You were an inventor, weren't you? Before you went blind.\" \"Yes... I miss it sometimes. But without my eyes...\" There was a flash of sadness. \"Well, let's start by reading this. And who knows... maybe you can teach me to be your eyes.\" It would be a fair trade, after all he had done. And at least she would not become completely redundant to him that way. \"You would do that for me?\" Thomas beamed like she had never seen him smile before. \"Gladly.\" After that, she started to read. It did not make much sense to her, if she was honest. But then again, she never had taken an interest in engineering before. For Thomas though, she would gladly learn. They stayed up late – the smile on his face when she read to him was so precious she didn't dare stop. Finally, though, he suggested they call it a night and then carried her upstairs. She couldn't sleep. She had seen yet another side of him tonight, and it had made her love him even more. The inventor Thomas was a passionate and confident man without fear, though still as sweet and caring as the rest of him. She would do everything to everything to coax that side out, even if it meant learning a whole new profession. Then, suddenly, Thomas screamed loudly into the pitch-dark night. Getting up, Janey immediately went to his side, ignoring her ankle which twinged in protest. It was nearly healed – she would manage. \"It's alright, Thomas. It's ok. No one will get you,\" she said, soothingly. She didn't know what demons he was fighting but he seemed to be in torment over something. Surely that talk about inventing had not brought on the bad dreams? It was part of his old life – maybe it had triggered something. It was chilly in Thomas's room, and the fact that she was tired did not help. Quickly, she slipped under the covers, cradling him in her arms. It was not like he would know – despite the scream, he was still asleep, and she would be gone before the morrow. She would just stay with him until he calmed down... Esmem83976 -There is more to Janey's hardship, but that will be revealed soon. PrettyPants -And they are working on it smithsbabe65- Adorably broken... I like that term! And... not much longer, I promise. Writingbliss36 – Glad you started, I hope you continue reading! belladu57 – Thank you And thanks to KatyForYou for liking my smutty OLLA one shot. Yes, my dear other readers, it is rated M so you have been warned.[Chapter 16] As Thomas woke up that morning, he felt an unfamiliar weight on his shoulder. There was someone in bed with him... Janey. The smell of jasmine was unmistakable. But what was she doing here? Not that he minded having her here. It was just unexpected. He had been dreaming of her. Well, he had been dreaming of a beautiful woman with red hair, and somehow he had known it was her, though he really had no idea what she looked like. She had been laying on a bed before him. He had kissed her... And done some quite inappropriate things... Now that he was awake, he had to remind himself that she was his servant and, more importantly, his friend that he did not want to lose... though there were certain parts of his body were not helping matters. Her closeness felt so good. It was hard enough to ignore this fact during the day as he carried her around, but now, still half in a slumber... No! There was nothing sexual about their relationship, and he should not wish to make it so. However much he loved her, he was damaged goods. Besides, she had told that she did not want a relationship, not with any man. He couldn't blame her. And yet... Softly, she whimpered \"No... no, please... Don't hurt mummy... Please. I'll be good.\" Those words, so familiar, cut like a knife. How many times had he begged his mother not to punish his sister? It never made a difference. With his father, he hadn't even tried... if the man had an audience, he would hit harder, as if it was a show. Vague images of other dreams from last night started coming to the surface. He had been chased... first by his father, then later by his sister, calling him a wicked boy. She had tried to stab him, not in the eye this time, but in his private parts, which had been aroused. He felt disgusted by himself, but his sister had just laughed, crying out \"There is no pleasure without pain.\" His nightmare was over now, but Janey was in the middle of hers, and the more he tried to calm her, the more she started to thrash and whimper. There was only one thing for it. \"Janey... Wake up. It's alright, it's just a bad dream. No one will hurt you.\" He hugged her close, kissing the top of her head. It woke her up... and startled her. She pushed away from him and nearly would have pushed herself out of bed had he not been holding on to her. \"Thomas...\" she said, crawling back into his arms and finally settling against him. It was the sweetest sort of torture ever as he tried to keep his half-awoken manhood away from her. \"Janey, are you ok?\" he gently asked. \"Hmmm...Yes... You had a bad dream. You screamed... I must have fallen asleep... sorry,\" she murmured softly. He gently stroked her head. \"You were having the bad dream, Janey.\" \"No no no... Last night, you were having a bad dream and screamed. So I came to see you. It was cold, so I slipped under the covers and I must have dozed of. I'm ever so sorry...\" Sweet Janey. Sweet, sweet, sweet Janey. She even took care of him in his sleep, chasing away the ghosts. He loved her even more for it. \"It's fine. Thank you, in fact. You had a bad dream as well just now. Are you ok?\" \"Yes... Yes I am, now.\" She curled back up to him. He liked having her there by his side, it made him feel... like a different man – but he wasn't sure that was a good thing. Feeling stirred, feelings he had been trying to ignore, for they were far from appropriate. \"Is it morning, yet?\" he said, just so he would have something to say. What he really wanted to do was cuddle her closer, kiss her... \"I don't know... it's darkish, but it's raining. It could be anything between 5 and 11 am. You don't have a clock. But I suppose I could get up and check,\" she yawned, getting up. He yanked her back more forcefully than he had been meaning to do, and she landed back on his shoulder wth a yelp. \"Sorry... I didn't mean to hurt you. Are you ok? What I meant to say was that if the weather is awful, why should we get up?\" \"I'm fine, you didn't hurt me, just surprised me, that's all. But we need to have breakfast at some point. And, besides, this is not my bed. It's not appropriate. I should not have imposed myself on you like that. Really, I'm so sorry,\" she apologised. \"Don't. Who cares? There is no one here to judge us. I'm glad you came. I haven't had a nightmare since you have been here.\" All he felt was grateful. Grateful that she cared. There was a slight hesitation. \"You have had them... several. I heard you scream, so I came over the second night I was here... I went to you and sat beside you till you calmed down. I've done it several times since.\" She was... doing this on a regular basis? All so he could sleep in peace? \"Janey... You shouldn't. What about your sleep?\" \"It's ok. You sound so tormented sometimes... I wouldn't want to be alone either,\" was her simple answer. \"Thank you. But I still don't think you should waste precious sleep time on me.\" He pulled her closer, kissing the top of her head. She lifted up her head from his shoulder and scrutinized him... Or at least, that was what it felt like, as she said nothing and did not stir any further. Then, before he knew it, two of the softest lips pressed against his. He was too stunned to reciprocate. For so long he had convinced himself that he was unlovable, especially now that the outside matched his wicked inside. She was kissing him. It was a dream come true, and yet... He knew was a wicked boy, just like his sister had said. There was a darkness there he could not shake and he could certainly not expose Janey to it. Not in a million years could he be worthy of love, especially from someone so pure and kind. When he thought of the things he wanted to do with this innocent girl... He knew he should not. It would not be fair to her, and he doubted she would be able to handle it after what she had told him. If he kissed her back, it could only lead to hurt for her in the long run, when she found out who he really was, what he had really done. He had failed the people he loved all his life. Why would anyone want to be with a monster like him? Yet, if the kiss was anything to go by, she wanted him... and he wanted her so badly... it was torture of the sweetest kind. Why had he spoken about love and marital relations? It had been excruciating for them both, and probably sent her head in a spin. What kind of evil man was he to tempt such an angel? Still, he loved her so so much. The idea of her ever leaving him was excruciating. He wanted nothing more than to hold her, forever. She deserved love, even if he did not, and he felt a cad for denying her. He was about show her the beauty of love,and kiss her in return with all of his might, when he felt her waiver. And then she ran from the room... With David Bowie and Alan Rickman dying in one week I gotta say I felt sick to my stomach, and in no mood to write, so it took some effort to pull myself together. I loved them both... And that was exactly why I combined their two most iconic roles when I created Green Eyes. It made sense, they are connected, and similar in a way. It's not finished, but I'm more than ever determined to do so, though I need a while to get over their loss. They will be missed. Sparky She-Demon : Yes, of course. Else these kids will never get it. And glad you liked Cold Blood Princess PrettyPants : Actually, no. Not more than usual anyways, haunting his dreams. Harlequin Shadow: Welcome, and glad you like it. Smithsbabe65 : I actually make a point of making Janey as far from Lucille as possible, but also from Edith. Thomas had woman upon woman rule his life with an iron grip, and it is time to be himself. For the twist in Cold Blood I suggest you read up on Lilith. Jim Jarmush did not mean the biblical Adam and Eve with them, but I'm telling you he made a mistake there (oh dear, Tom don't kill me please) See there is a whisper of another wife for Adam, before Eve there was Lilith, created not from the rib of a man, but equal from the same dust. She was not submissive enough for Adam though, they argued and in the end, she walked out. Adam was none too pleased, and neither was God, they tried to get her back by threatening her, but she refused. And rumor is she became a night demon... Perhaps the first vampire. Yes Jim, you missed out there, what better revenge than turning Adams and Eves throughout time. Ravenstag : Thank you for all the reviews, I loved reading them. I hope you have caught up. And don't worry, I fell for Thomas too because there is such a fragile side to him... And so did Janey. Belco: I'm glad you liked it.[Chapter 17] What had she done? Janey was in her room, pacing back and forth... which made her ankle hurt. She didn't care. She felt lost. Why... Why had she kissed him? Her boss... He was her employer, not a friend... and certainly not a lover. And yet, she seemed to have totally forgotten that... forgotten convention... imagining all sorts of things between them that just weren't there. Worse, she had taken advantage of him. Of a defenceless blind man. Could she be any more pathetic? She hated herself right now. And yet she loved him... But he obviously he did not reciprocate her feelings. She heard a knock on her door. \"Please Janey, we have to talk.\" How long could she stall – and pretend this wasn't happening. It felt gut-wrenching – as if someone was sawing her in two. If she could just go back... \"I'll be right down and make you breakfast. After that... I'll wire to have me replaced, alright?\" \"Replace you? What are you talking about? Please Janey, don't leave. I love having you here. You love being here. Let's talk. Let me in.\" He tried to turn the doorknob, but it was locked. She stared at the door indecisively. If she let him in...That would be the end. One last conversation, until he reached the same conclusion she had. She couldn't stay, not after the way she behaved. And she wasn't sure if she could stop herself if it happened again. Well, maybe that wasn't such a problem. He did not want her, after all. Why else had he not kissed her back? She still loved him though, and far more than she had realised. How could she be with him, day in and day out, if her love weren't reciprocated? How could she cook for him, care for him, touch him, all without feeling? She also couldn't let him just stand there... she could hear the desperation in his voice. So, she opened her door. \"Sorry... I don't know why I did that. I shouldn't have.\" He reached out for her, taking her in his arms, holding her close to him. It hurt – she wanted it so much, but she knew it wasn't possible. \"Janey, Janey, I love you so much,\" he whispered into her hair. \"Just not like that,\" she murmured, pushing away. \"I understand.\" She was on the verge of tears, but she would not allow herself to give in. The last thing she needed was his pity. A clean break, that was what was needed. \"I know I went too far this morning. So, I will pack my bags, and be out of your way.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He looked genuinely confused. \"I'm sorry I kissed you, alright? I know you don't find me desirable. Why would you? I'm just plain Janey.\" She tried to leave but he wouldn't let her. Instead, he pulled her back in her arms. \"Let me go, Thomas. Please!\" she cried. This was torture. Part of her wanted to melt away in those arms that felt so safe. But it meant nothing, she reminded herself. \"Not before you listen to me. You're wrong. It's me who is ugly. You are a beautiful woman. The most beautiful I... never saw. I love you more than words can say. You have a beautiful heart, Janey. But... I do not. I'm a horrible man. I'm not right for you – or anyone else, for that matter. You don't know my past, Janey. And I don't know if you will want to know me once you do. You probably won't.\" Was that it? His past? His guilt? Was that what it boiled down to in the end? Was that why... She hardly dared to hope. But if that was all... \"I know who you are. I know what happened up there in that house. Edith told me everything. We became friends three years ago. She is a wonderful woman, the closest thing I have to family, even though we only met a few times. She told me about you, her, and your sister, your childhood in that horrid home, your wives, the ghosts, the horrors... \" \"You know what I did?... And you still came?\" he asked. His face was clouded over. He looked more defeated than ever. \"I'm a monster. Luckily, I'm blind now, so I can't harm anyone any more. She wanted to hug him, but right now she wasn't sure what to do. All she could do was talk. \"You're a victim. You didn't hurt anyone. Your sister murdered those people.\" Thomas shrugged. \"I lacked the will to do anything. Their deaths are as much my fault for keeping silent. I knew... Not everything maybe, but enough to know what was going on was wrong. I could have stopped her. But I didn't, which makes me as guilty as she is.\" \"She was family. And, by the sound of it, the only one you had. The only one who cared. It's so hard to go against that.\" She knew that better than anyone. She still loved her mother... despite everything. \"We did things together... Things that were not right.\" It sounded like a apology. She knew horrible things had happened. Some had appalled her. But that was before she had met him and learned what a wonderful and loving man he was. She had forgiven him a long time ago. \"You mean the fact you were lovers. Edith told me that, too. I'm not going to pretend I understand that part. But you loved her. You did not force yourself on her, did you?\" Thomas violently shook his head. \"Never! She was my everything. The only person that had ever loved me. She needed me. Even if it was all so twisted... I would never have hurt her. She already was in so much pain. There was so little love in our lives that when she touched me... It felt good to feel love... Pleasure. That was such a rare thing in our lives. So, I did what she told me to do... to make her happy... even though I knew somewhere it was wrong. That you did not do this with your sister. But I was wicked anyway, and so was she. So, it did not matter.\" \"I understand, Thomas.\" She could not help herself now – tears started rolling down her face. He continued his story, unaware. \"She always took blame for me, took the punishment. I owed it to her to give her some happiness at least. She was beaten... So violently. Whilst I would hide... till it was over... I'm still hiding, aren't I?\" She stayed quiet for a while, thinking about it, furiously wiping the tears from her face. \"Yes... But, in my own way, so am I, probably.\" She had hidden away from everyone that had tried to come close. And now she was planning to run away from the one man that really mattered to her. Could she really do that? Especially... if there was hope? \"You? But you are brave,\" he said disbelievingly. \"No, I'm not. I keep everyone at arm's length, afraid they will hurt me. Because they will – they always have. I love it here, because I don't have to depend on anyone, except you. I trust you.\" Even if she couldn't explain it, she felt safe with him. \"I'm not right to be around. Maybe you are right to leave. If you only knew how many people I let down..\" No... not now. \"But you didn't let Edith down. Not when it mattered. You never let me down. Your only fault is that you are too sweet. You care so much that you let people walk all over you. You let Mrs Allsop terrorise you, didn't you?\" \"Yes... How can you stand to be with a man that is so weak?\" \"Because you make me feel safe. I know you'd never hurt me.\" \"I'm not much use when it comes to protecting you, though.\" She saw him pull away again. It was now or never, or she'd lose him for good. \"But you'd do it anyway.\" She knew he would – no matter the consequences, he would keep her safe. He had changed in that respect – she had seen him change these past few weeks when he had been taking care of her. He wasn't afraid to stand up to people any more. He nodded. \"Yes. I'd sacrifice my life to save you.\" \"And that, Thomas Sharpe, is why I love you.\" It felt like her heart was breaking all over again. She threw her arms around him and held on for dear life. \"I love you too.\" His hands found her face, forcing her to look at him. He sought her lips and kissed her. It was like a burden was released from her shoulders. \"I loved you from the day you walked in here.\" That surprised her, and she took a step away to take him all in. \"But I boss you around. Like your sister did.\" \"You?\" He laughed through his tears. It felt so good, she started to smile as well. He loved her. \"You do nothing of the sort. You made me live again. Actually, no. You made me live for the first time. Free from fear and darkness. You are nothing like my sister.\" \"I tell you what to do,\" she argued. \"Yes, but if I said no, would you still make me do it?\" \"Of course not. You never say no, though.\" Not as far as she could remember. \"Because I never need to. I love the things we do together. The walks. The reading... the dancing, though I'm sure I look ridiculous.\" \"Surprisingly, you don't. You look quite dashing. I feel like a princess.\" \"Kiss me.\" His tone was quite demanding. More so than she had ever heard him use before – but she wasn't scared. \"Are you ordering me, Mr Sharpe?\" she said, although her tone was begging him to do just that. He held out his hands for her to grab. \"Never.\" \"I guess that's ok then.\" She sat him down on the bed and then climbed onto his lap. Then she kissed him until he fell backwards. Her man. Esmem83976 : I wouldn't say weird. Yes I know you are doing a happy dance right now. In fact you all probably are. Elsie girl : Yes Pilot is one of the winks to Jane Eyre Belco : He is getting around to it as you see-through TheLadyBookworm: Your mind needs to be in writing mode... But it's back smithsbabe65 : You knew Lilith? Have I told you yet I absolutely adore you? HUGS! For Blind Monster: We got off the snail's pace. Certain things needed to be said, but now they are out in the open... all bets are off.[Chapter 18] He did not deserve to be this happy. But he was. Janey was in his arms, showering him with kisses. She had not let him go since this morning – and neither had he let go her. It felt so good. Breakfast had been made whilst she leaned back against him, and they had walked Pilot hand in hand. He had carried her home, as her ankle had been playing up. And now she was sitting in his lap on the couch. Nobody had ever loved him like this before. No lies, no parading around like he was someone else. She loved him. How had he gotten this lucky, after all the horrible things he had been part of? \"Why the frown, Mr Sharpe?\" Janey suddenly asked, tracing his brow. It pulled him from his dark thoughts. He hadn't realised it had been showing. \"What?\" \"You are frowning.\" There was some accusation in her voice, but also playfulness. He sighed. \"It's nothing.\" \"I'm just a terrible kisser?\" She tried to sound light, but he could hear the hesitation and uncertainty in her voice. He could kick himself for being so stupid... Anything but hurt her. \"No! You are a wonderful kisser. Why would you say such a thing?\" She shrugged, wobbling on his lap. \"Well, I don't have much experience. I have no experience, really. The one guy that did kiss me, I kicked him in the balls. Deservedly so, I might add... He tried to...Get a lot further... And he was a bully.\" He wanted to hit the jerk himself, but what could he do? \"Was he one of the men that wanted to break you?\" \"Yes.\" By the way she was moving, he could feel she was trying to pull away. He had reminded her of hurtful events, on top of making her insecure. Maybe he was the jerk. Or at least an idiot. \"I'm so sorry...\" She cupped his face. \"What did I tell you about apologising for things that are not your fault?\" \"That was not an apology. I just... Someone hurt you. I want to... I don't know... Do something to make it better.\" \"You are doing something to make it better. Well, you will do if you stop frowning, and teach me how to kiss you properly.\" She wasn't scolding him him, but he still felt bad. \"Believe me, you are a natural. Kissing you is heaven. I just... You know everything. How can you still love me?\" He couldn't understand how she could do that when he could not even forgive himself. Now she sighed. \"Do we have to talk about that? It brings up so much hurt.\" \"I can deal with that.\" His past was dark but, by reminding himself of it, he made sure he did not become that way. He needed it, in order to stay sane. Her tone sharpened. \"But I can't. I don't like thinking of what happened to me. It's over, I'm safe now. I don't want to dwell in that past, or it will pull me under. And I'm not going to let him win.\" It confused him. \"Let who win?\" \"My father. Let's just say that, when Edith described your father to me, I recognised a lot of my own in him. He was a cruel drunkard that liked it when we suffered and shivered in fear of him.\" Only at that moment did he realise that she had been talking about her own darkness. He knew so little about her. Because he had not wanted to talk about himself, afraid she would hate him, he had not dared to asked. But now he wanted to know. No skeleton in her closet could possibly match his. Just like her father, his father had constantly blamed his mother. It had broken her, and his sister... And him too. He started to understand Janey better. \"Is that why you push men away?\" \"Mostly. The rest of them weren't very nice either. Like I said before, I got taunted a lot for my red hair. And then there was this man I kicked. He thought he owned me, because his father had married my mother. My mother remarried after my father's death, you see. We were dirt poor, so she had no other choice. And she married a good man, even though he was a lot older. Old enough to be my grandad. But he treated us good. He sent me to school, made sure I got a proper education. When I was nineteen, he got sick, though, so his son came and took over. And his son wasn't kind at all. He tried to force himself on me several times... Luckily, we were interrupted every time. Until the last time, when he had me locked in a barn. He looked just like my father, dark and looming. I kicked and clawed my way out of there. I remember his jaw bleeding as I scratched his face... When my mother found out, she was furious... Not at him though, but at me. She said I had ruined everything. I left that night, and I haven't seen her since.\" She had started to weep, and Thomas could kick himself for pushing her so far. \"I'm sorry... I wish I could take away the pain.\" As he pulled her in his arms, he felt her tremble. \"You're not the one who hurt me. I know you would never do such a thing,\" she murmured in his shoulder. Again he was touched by her faith in him. \"I wish I was. I live in daily fear of turning out like them. My mother, my father, my sister. They were all cruel in their own right. How can I be any different?\" She dried her tears. \"Because you care. And you never stopped caring. My mother, she stopped caring... I don't want to talk about that right now, though. But you did what you did because you cared for your sister...\" \"But not for my wives. Not enough, at least, or I would have stopped my sister. I knew it was wrong. But I was too weak... Too weak.\" He shook his head. The guilt would always haunt him, he feared. \"You are free of that now. Stronger. And you're not to blame. You haven't hurt anyone.\" \"I hurt many people with my weakness, I hurt Edith.\" And it pained him that he couldn't change it. \"She is over that. And it made her stronger,\" she said soothingly. \"No one should become stronger like that.\" He felt tears starting to roll down his cheeks and cursed himself for his weakness. Janey needed him this time round, and yet she was there for him. \"You are right. Neither should you. But it happened. And you came out on the other side a kind and gentle man. I'm not afraid of you Thomas, and neither should you be,\" she hugged him. \"I wish I could be that certain. I want you to be safe with me.\" \"I am. I know I am safe with you. You won't harm me.\" There was no uncertainty in her voice this time round. How could he ever be worthy of the faith she had in him? \"I don't deserve you.\" \"Too bad, you'll have to make do with me.\" She curled up close to his chest. \"You know I don't mean it like that. I love you, Janey. More than anything,\" he said pressing a kiss to her forehead. Sparky She-demon: And even more happiness to follow Esmem83976: No no, not the end. Not by far. PrincessPrettyPants: Yay! See, you you would be happy. Smithsbabe65: More revelations, and more acceptance to come. It feels good to have them together. And important to show their love is real, and not build on false impressions like with Edith, where I get the idea that they both just had an ideal image of the other one, which turned out false.[Chapter 19] All Janey's dreams had come true it seemed – dreams she hadn't even known she had. Love had never been in the cards... but here it was. But, even thought she loved him, and was happy he was so loving, she wished he would stop being so insecure about himself. If he truly had that evil inside him, it would have come out by now – she was sure of that. In contrast, he had only become more loving. And that couldn't have been easy. However, as much as she tried to reassure him, she couldn't take away his fears. It was time to go to bed... She wasn't sure what to do as they reached the top of the stairs. Was she going to her own bed? Or was she going to join him? \"Goodnight Janey,\" he said, softly kissing her neck. It felt so good, she didn't want to move. \"Goodnight, I suppose.\" \"What is wrong? Don't you want to go to bed?\" he asked as he noticed she hadn't stirred. \"Not without you.\" \"I could come with you.\" The kiss moved to her mouth. Feelings stirred inside her. It felt confusing. She wanted him, but... it scared her at the same time. \"But... I'm not sure I'm ready for... more than kissing. Could we just sleep?\" she asked, seeking a compromise. \"Of course... I would never push myself on you. But I would love to hold you tonight... I still don't understand how you can be so understanding... of me. Of all that what happened. Are you sure Edith told you everything?\" It was the question that had been hanging between them all day, and she still wasn't sure how to reassure him, other than confirm her love for him. \"Yes, Thomas. You are lovable, trust me. Very lovable. You make me feel safe.\" Maybe she had to tell him everything after all. Maybe she had to make him see he wasn't alone in his pain. She took her top off. It was brazen, but it needed to be done \"I want to show you something. Well, make you feel something. Put your arms around me.\" \"You're naked,\" he said, shocked as he touched her bare skin. \"Yes. That's not what this is about. Feel my back.\" It was time to tell him everything. He recognised it immediately as he put his hands on her. \"You... you were lashed. My sister's back was like that. My father would whip her to pieces.\" \"My father lashed me regularly. One time, he nearly killed me. It was over nothing. He said I hadn't closed a gate properly, so stock had gotten out. In fact, it turned out afterwards that he had been the one to leave it open. He wasn't sorry either. The next week, he was dead.\" She felt strangely calm. It felt so far away now, as if it had happened to someone else. \"How?\" he asked. The next part of the story she had never told to anybody. \"Well, everyone turned a blind eye... But my mother killed him. Put a pillow over his head and suffocated him when he got drunk again. Everyone knew what he was like. No one did anything. So, when he nearly killed me, something in her snapped. She murdered him. Unfortunately, it never snapped back. She became cold after that... distant. I lost them both that day. My father, but also my mother. She still took care of me, but it was like she wasn't really there. So, from there on, I was alone.\" He pulled her close to his chest. \"Oh Janey... I'll always be there for you – do you hear me? You'll always have a home here.\" She smiled with relief – he had reacted just as she had hoped he would. With him, she was free – there was no need to keep secrets. Here she was safe, enveloped in his arms. \"I love you so much.\" He kissed her shoulder, gently without urgency. It caused her earlier feelings to flare up. She suddenly decided she wanted more and started untying his cravat. She loved him, and he loved her. There was nothing to be afraid of. \"Janey? What are you doing?\" he asked, startled. \"I want you, Thomas.\" The doubt melted away. \"Are you sure? I don't want to force you.\" \"You and force? I should be asking if I am forcing you.\" \"Do you have any idea how much I want you?\" His arms tightened around her as he pulled her closer. She moved her lips up to his ear and whispered, \"Show me.\" He lifted her up, carrying her to bed without bumping into it. Gently, he lay her down like she was more precious than gold and then started to undressing. \"My work is done. You don't need me any more,\" she said, watching his sure movements. \"Are you kidding me? I need you more than ever. I love you. In fact, will you marry me?\" He kneeled beside her, taking her hand. Janey was quiet. \"Sorry, Thomas... I can't... I don't want to lose... I just can't. I do love you.\" \"I know. You're scared. It's alright. Maybe I'm not the best husband anyway, not with my track record. I love you either way. To live in sin... I've sinned worse.\" \"Our love is not a sin,\"she said adamantly. He shook his head.\"It isn't... Of course it isn't. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Our love is real, and nothing can change that. I'm not going to push you into something you are not ready for. So if you want to, we can stop this right now, and I'll simply hold you as promised.\" \"I don't want to stop. I want you. Just marriage...\" It scared her. Even though he was nothing like her father. As long as she was unmarried, she was in control. \"I really love you. And I want to be with you... all the way.\" \"And I love you.\" Thomas stayed on the floor though. There seemed to be hesitation on his part. It made her nervous. \"Don't you want me?\" \"Of course I do! I just... I'm blind. I... It's going to be different. And I don't want to hurt you.\" His fingers toyed deftly with his cravat. \"I'm not afraid of that. Let's do it like we always do. Use your hands, and let me guide you.\" She pulled him up until he was on the bed with her. \"H-have you been with a man before?\" He was nervous... So was she, but she wasn't going to give into that. Not now. \"No. I'm the girl that let no one come close, remember?\" Except for him. From the moment she had come here, she had felt this bond, like that of two lost souls that had finally found each other. \"I feel privileged.\" Gently, he stroked her back. \"Yes. I want you.\" She kissed his neck and continued to undress him. \"You know I can do that myself, right?\" he smiled. \"I do.. But I want you now.\" It was like unwrapping a gift. She bared his chest, revealing not just the pale skin underneath, but also the scars. She had seen them before, but never like this. All she wanted to do was kiss them all away. Every hurt, every pain... and then he pulled her close to him again. Only two reviews? I hope you still like it because there is more to come, you know... Things are getting... heated. Esmem83976 : It's only going to better for them now thy are together. Sparky She-Demon : Both of them are their own worse enemy, but luckily they are also very understanding towards eachother.[Chapter 20] Her lips were on his chest, and Thomas shivered. Lust and love were pulsating through him, but he couldn't rid himself of the feeling that this was wrong. Even though Janey had said she wanted him, it still felt like he was taking advantage of her. How could a monster like him ever be worthy of an angel like her? \"I have made many mistakes in my life, and I know I don't deserve you...\" A finger was placed on his lips. \"Shhh, it doesn't matter. I don't care.\" She placed more kisses along his collarbone, her naked body pressed against him, stirring up feelings that were hard to deny. She should not be trying to comfort him. He wanted to be there for her. To protect her as best he could. \"It does. You need to know I love you more than anything. I promise you, I will never fail you.\" Janey sighed and turned away. \"That's a promise that's impossible to keep, Thomas.\" He could have slapped himself. \"I will do my best to honour you every day of your life, though. I want you to feel safe.\" \"Thomas, you make me feel safer than I ever felt in my life. Now please...\" There was desperation in her voice. Make love to me, that was what she was saying. He felt nervous... he wanted to take charge but, more than anything, he wanted to do this right – for her. He kissed her neck, taking in her scent. \"You're beautiful.\" \"How can you tell?\" It sounded defiant. Why couldn't she believe she was gorgeous? \"I can feel it,\" he whispered softly in her ear. He did not need eyes to know she was beautiful. She smelled beautiful... the softness of her lips was beautiful... the curve of her breasts... the gentleness of her touch... the sound of her voice. But most beautiful of all was her soul. Where everyone else saw a monster, she could see goodness. She had faith in him where he had not. So what was holding him back? He rolled her onto her back and trailed kisses down her chest. He was going to do this right. He was going to make her squeal with delight. Because he loved her. As he kissed her breast and then sucked her nipple, he heard her breath hitch. Her fingers got tangled in his curls. He kissed further down. As he reached her belly, she giggled, so he stopped for a moment. \"Don't!\" The grip on his curls tightened for a second. \"Don't what?\" He grinned as he looked up. Well, he couldn't see her, but he wished he could. He was sure that there was no more beautiful sight on earth. \"Don't stop... Please?\" She sounded so insecure... He had never heard her like that. Like she thought he would leave her now. Reject her. He could never do that. \"I wasn't planning to.\" She was still dressed from the waist down. He hooked her fingers in her skirt and the layers underneath and gently peeled them off her body, following the curve of her hips. As he let his hands run over her body, he tried to imagine her creamy white skin, set off by that flaming red hair. \"My little sprite,\" he whispered hoarsly. \"I feel so naked.\" Her hand tried to cover the breast he had been kissing. Her shyness was endearing. \"That's because you are... Close your eyes.\" \"Then we will both be blind.\" \"Just feel. Trust me.\" \"Always.\" She got the gentlest kiss right on her sex for that, which made her shiver. It was all new to her, he realised. Who was he to take her innocence? On the other hand, who was he to deny her, when she was practically begging him to love her? She wanted him, she had told him time and again. She felt safe with him. And he loved her more than he dared to think about, afraid it would all be taken away again. But not tonight. Tonight he'd show her love. His hands caressed her buttocks, her thighs as he wrapped her legs over his shoulders. She was so soft, so sensual, and she had no idea... It made him strain against his trousers. But, as much as he wanted her, he wanted her to be ready, to enjoy it without pain. To relax, for he could feel the tension run through her body. As much as she claimed she wanted him, she was also nervous. So he let his tongue caress her clit, until she started bucking against him. Her moans grew louder – it was like music to his ears. He couldn't help but smile as her hand found his and she squeezed it, first gently, then harder as an orgasm took over and she shuddered. The straining of his manhood grew intolerable now, and he took off his trousers. This was it. He gently hovered over her, positioning himself. He had to ask one more time, even though he was almost at the point of no return. \"Are you sure?\" he softly whispered. His cock was already pressing against her opening, and it took everything to restrain himself. Her arms went around his neck and she kissed him passionately, wrapping herself around him. It wasn't an answer though and he was not moving without her permission. Finally, she said yes, and he thrust himself inside of her. She went rigid, which frightened him. What if he had been wrong, and she wasn't ready.? Of course... She was a virgin, clueless... She probably had not fully understood what he asked permission for. He was robbing his angel of her innocence, and hurting her in the process. He dared not move, either way. \"Thomas, are you alright?\" she asked, sounding a little scared. \"Yes... Yes. Are you?\" He softly stroked her back. She clung to him.\"Yes.\" \"No...No pain?\" \"Not really...It's supposed to hurt a little, isn't it?\" As tight as she was, it wasn't a surprise, but he didn't want her in pain. The ultimate bliss for him, but not when she was hurt. \"Let me kiss it better.\" As his lips sought hers, her legs closed around him, and he couldn't help but thrust. She whimpered, which made him want to stop again. \"Don't stop,\" she urged as if she knew. So... That was a good whimper. He did it again, eliciting another moan. Slowly but surely, he started building up a rhythm, as her moans grew louder. Finally, as he could no longer hold back himself, she shouted his name, and he found a release he had never felt before, free from guilt or sadness. There was no one but her in the moment. Janey, sweet Janey, her scent, her softness, her warmth. He wanted to stay there forever... but, before long, his body started feeling heavy and he had to roll off her to avoid crushing her. She whimpered. \"Come here, my lovely sprite,\" he said, beckoning her towards him. She nestled on his shoulder. \"Thank you.\" \"No Janey. Thank you... For taking pity on an old wretch like me.\" This made Janey sit up. \"That was not pity! I love you.\" \"Sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I love you too, Janey. And I want nothing more than to make you happy.\" He pulled her into another kiss. Her body formed herself to his, holding him tight. \"You did Thomas, you did.\" Princess Prettypants: They love eachother enough to let the other free. That is enough for now Sparky She-Demons: The ghost in CP are warnings from the past... I don't think they need that right now. Belco: Glad you like it. Smithsbabe65: Glad you are back. It's not even so much the freedom than the fact that he understands how hard this must be for Janey which makes him act so carefully. He loves her and he wants her to find true happiness, give her the experience of a lifetime. Basically it's another tender way of expressing his love and respect to her, although he does also take charge, which I found very important. Lucille and Edith initiated their physical relationship, Lucille when Thomas was still to young to understand, Edith did it with his consent but still was the one taking charge. This time it's Thomas' choice and responsibility, one he takes very serious. TheLadyBookworm : I'm sorry to hear about your pain, but glad I can offer some distraction. Consider this chapter dedicated to you.[Chapter 21] Janey woke up in his arms. Warm, safe, comforting, bliss. No bad dreams had haunted her tonight... Or Thomas. She was sure that, if he had stirred or cried out, she would have woken up... but there he was, looking more peaceful than she had ever seen him. Last night had been wonderful... magical…. beyond words really. Thomas was tender yet passionate, as a lover and as a man. Too perfect almost, though she couldn't imagine him being any other way. And that was why she loved him. And why she found it hard to believe he loved her. Janey had all but resigned to become an old spinster. Love had never been an option – the danger that came with letting people close was just to great. Men especially. Until she met Thomas. He had shown her that it was possible to believe in goodness without knowing it. And she admired him greatly for it. He looked beautiful, slumbering like this. The face of an angel. She kissed him gently on his cheek. His eyelids fluttered. \"Hello beautiful, finally awake?\" he said, slowly opening them. \"Hey, you were the one with your eyes closed. I am fully awake,\" she said, putting her arms around him. He immediately pulled her into a hug. \"Maybe I fell asleep again... I was just listening to you in your sleep,\" he yawned. \"No bad dreams tonight, eh?\" \"Only wonderful ones of you... Make love to me again… Please.\" Janey wanted more. She wanted him to possess her. Never in a million years would she have thought that she would ever want anything of a man, but the feeling of him inside her... It filled her with desire. He kissed her... and her stomach growled. \"After breakfast. I promise,\" he said, turning to get up. \"But I want you now.\" Her stomach, though, definitely had other ideas. \"Ignore that.\" \"I most certainly will not. I will feed you, and only then I will make love to you.\" His tone was strict... But there was a smile on his face. He was taking care of her, and she liked it. Even if it didn't get her what she desired. \"When did you become so demanding?\" she complained. He wrapped her in his arms. \"Since I fell in love with a very stubborn woman. She is lovely, but she demands things go her way, even if that is not in her best interest, because she insist on taking care of me. So, I decided to look out for her, whether she likes it or not. Because I love her more than life. You mean everything to me, Janey.\" She frowned. \"You make me sound very pushy.\" \"In the best possible way, trust me. I want to spoil you, Janey.\" \"You know I don't want that. I'm not some leech that takes advantage of you. I'm with you because I love you.\" \"I know, and that is exactly why I want to make all your dreams come true. So, what do you dream of, Janey?\" \"You, making love to me,\" she said trying to coax him into another kiss. \"I told you, after breakfast. Or during, if you are good...\" he held her in his arms. \"You have no idea how much I want you, but I won't let you starve.\" \"Alright, I relent,\" she said, grabbing her robe. \"It's just because I love you.\" \"Then it's probably a good thing I love you too. What else would I do with a stubborn man that insists of taking care of me in every possible way,\" she said, getting up. Her ankle hurt a bit this morning but she wasn't going to let it stop her today. Life was... Too good to be true. It was frightening. Things like this did not happen to girls like her. How did she end up with her own handsome, loving prince, who was rich to boot? Not that she cared about his money. Alright, there were some scratches on him. He was scarred, body and soul... but it was what made him even more perfect to her. And, despite his scars, he was still very beautiful. With that alabaster skin and fine toned muscle, his was like the body of a god, the ones the Romans had carved out of marble. Before, she had never felt anything but contempt for the male body... until that first time she had seen him in the tub. There had been something... a stirring she hadn't dared to formulate. It was a miracle she had been able to resist him as long as she had. Of course, it was easier if he had something on, and not standing naked before her, that gorgeous cock of his standing to attention. Didn't that mean... \"What is wrong, beautiful?\" he got up, pressing his naked form against her. She rolled her eyes, \"Put something on.\" \"What, don't you like my naked form?\" He was joking, teasing, smiling. She hadn't ever seen him this happy. It filled her with warmth, knowing it was because of her. \"No... It's far too distracting... I want you so badly.\" He let a hand wander under her robe, to her hot centre She knew she was wet, and it had been solely from watching him. Was she really that wanton now? Well, she supposed she was.. And she didn't care \"Alright. A quick one,\" he finally relented. He pushed her against the wall, kissing her neck, his heat radiating through her. \"Are you ready for me?\" Her \"Yes\" was more of a whimper, but it had the desired effect, as he lifted her up, wrapping her legs around him, and shafted himself deep inside of her. \"You have no idea what you do to me, Janey,\" he whispered hoarsely. It looked as if he was trying to restrain himself for her benefit. \"You do the same to me. Take me.\" She clung onto him as he drove into her, again and again, until she exploded, shouting his name. It indeed was a quick one, but it had been exactly what she had been after. She didn't need his riches. She needed him. \"For the first time, I don't mind being wicked,\" he smiled, leaning into her as he got his breath back. \"You're not wicked. You are the loveliest, most wonderful man I ever met,\" she said as she sought his mouth. Their kiss was cut short by the bell ringing in the hallway. Janey felt a shock go through her body. \"Oh my god, it's ten o'clock,\" she realised, looking at the clock on her nightstand. \"Then that is probably Catherine.\" Catherine was their potato supplier, a lovely lady that brought the potatoes every Thursday. \"We are not dressed. We can't go like this.\" \"Well then...\" He kissed her deeply, before going to his room. \"We can't leave her waiting forever.\" \"I'll go,\" Janey yelled after him, frantically trying to find some clothes she could open the door in. She could see, surely she could be faster than Thomas... Before she even had her shoes on though, she saw him going down the stairs, perfectly dressed and totally in control. It was the complete opposite from the man she had seen that first day, although... \"Thomas, your hair.\" His curls were a gorgeous wild mess. He quickly ran his hand through them. Janey realised she didn't look much better. In fact, she looked utterly and truly ravished... Which she was. Xitlali : Glad you like it... This is not smut, this is true love... Lol Biddle29: Great you are enjoying it! Well, I try to keep them coming. smithsbabe65: I think the lovely thing about Thomas is that he doesn't push her, he lets her know the door is open, but he doesn't push her into marriage. It's up to her, and he just feels lucky for what he has. Oh and since Fanfiction does not have a High Rise category, I had to resort to posting my *smut* story on Archive Of Our own. Same pen name, title: \"Guilty Pleasures\"... Well good evening Mr Laing...[Chapter 22] Thomas knew he needed to see Catherine alone for a minute, without Janey there. If he was correct, she was carrying a parcel that Janey had no idea about. It would be perfect after last night to present her with this, even though he wasn't sure if she was going to like it... In fact he was pretty sure she was bound to protest, but he had bought it for her anyway. Janey deserved something gorgeous that made her shine and, if she was not going to buy it for herself, he would do it for her. The fact that this was probably the most rebellious thing he had ever done made him smile. But then again, Janey was different, and she gave him the sort of confidence he had never known he had. She put herself down a lot though, saying she wasn't worth it. She could be immensely fierce, but once it got to her appearance, she would start to depreciate herself. It wasn't just false modesty, he noticed. She was genuinely convinced she was not beautiful. And Thomas was genuinely convinced it wasn't true. Catherine had confirmed it, calling her a diamond in the rough but, even if she hadn't, he knew Janey possessed a kind of beauty that most people could only dream about. Her appearance was not why he loved Janey... He had loved her from the day she stepped into his life... But it had set him on a quest to make her see her outside beauty. With her dress torn because she had saved him, he had been determined to get her a new one. One that did her justice, rather than make her look dowdy. Which was where Catherine came in. She was a lovely, funny woman that had kindly greeted Thomas from the first day she came round with her potatoes. She acknowledged him, made a conversation which included him, and never ignored him like many other people did as soon as they noticed he was blind. When she had learned about Janey's accident, she had immediately been round to see if she could help – not for money, just to be a good friend. She was the ideal person to help Janey get a dress. And not something dowdy and practical... though not too impractical either, as he knew Janey would never wear it otherwise... but something to make her shine. \"Where is Janey?\" she asked carefully as she greeted him. \"Upstairs... For now. Do you have it?\" He so hoped she did... He also hoped this morning's activities could not still be read on his face. Then again, not everyone had the mind-reading skills Janey seemed to possess when it came to him. \"I do. I had a peek and it's as gorgeous as we hoped. Where do you want me to put it?\" \"Give it to me, I'll put it in the library, where I am sure she will find it later.\" The package was thrust in his hands. \"And what will you tell her? The pixies left it for her?\" Catherine chortled kindly. Thomas laughed with her. \"Actually, that's not a bad idea. It's probably the only way she will accept it.\" \"She is too nice for her own good.\" Catherine said, and Thomas wholeheartedly agreed. He smuggled the dress in just before Janey came down. Catherine left her wares in the pantry, and had a cup of tea and a chat with them before setting out again. Neither of them had the heart to tell Catherine they were starving because they hadn't eaten yet. As she left, Thomas sank him teeth into an apple, feeling absolutely ravenous. \"You were right, we should have eaten first,\" Janey giggled as she followed his example. \"Sorry, I should have offered you one first.\" Thomas berated himself on his lack of chivalry. The lack of sustenance was affecting his brain, as was her nearness. He wanted her. He got a kiss on his nose.\"Not to worry...,I can handle myself, Mister Sharpe,\"she said playfully, which made his desire only grow. Food. They needed to eat. \"Let' go straight for lunch and have a big luxurious picnic.\" \"I don't know, it looks like rain. Pilot will want his walk, but I don't think we should be out so long or we will get drenched.\" He imagined peeling off her clothes after she had gotten all wet, breathing heat into her cool wet skin. This was so not helping \"Picnic on the living room floor then... I might just make love to you again, my gorgeous girl,\" he whispered in her neck, leaving a peck there. \"Alright, I can live with that.. Whilst I'll make lunch, can you walk Pilot?\" she suggested. \"I thought we'd make lunch together.\" He didn't want to be separated from her for more that a second if he could help it. \"You like cooking, don't you?\" She snuggled against him. He nodded.\"It gives me a chance to make something again, however menial. And the importance is taste, not looks, so I don't need to see exactly what I am doing.\" Creating something was part of the man he once was, though he honestly had never done more than boiled a kettle before he had met Janey. \"I like having you in the kitchen too. But my ankle is a bit dodgy this morning, I don't think it's up for a long walk. I can still cook though. So we can eat once you get back.\" He wondered if had pushed her too far last night and this morning. It was hard to hold back when she was in his arms, though. \"If it's too much, I can do both.\" \"I'll be fine...\" she promised. He wasn't sure and gave her a doubtful look. \"If I can't stand up any more, I'll take a seat and wait till you get back to let you finish, alright?\" she assured him. He kissed her deeply once more. \"I'll be back as soon as I can, gorgeous.\" He really wanted to stay, but poor Pilot needed his walk, and he loved the dog almost as much as it's mistress. Luckily for Thomas, Pilot was quick about his business and wanted to go home straight after. Neither could wait to get back to the woman they both loved. Janey, however, had found the package in the meantime.\"Thomas, what is this?\" \"What is what?\" he said, playing dumb. There was, of course, always a chance she had found something else. But it didn't help that he felt a blush rise to his cheeks.. He couldn't lie, not to her. \"There is a dress on your desk in the living room. Thomas...\" She was waiting for what he had to say for himself. It was almost like she was asking him whether he had bought it for someone else. \"I know what you are going to say, but you deserve it. Your dress got ripped saving me, and you deserved something new. And since you turned down all my offers, I had to take matters into my own hands.\" It wasn't much of an excuse, but there it was. \"So this is not some sort of payment for last night? I thought...\" she wavered. \"What?\" He was usually pretty good in judging her mood by the sound of her voice. \"That you were paying me off or something. Like one would do with... a lady of loose morals.\" How could she even think that? \"Of course not! I can never repay you for last night... for making me the happiest man on earth. This dress is a thank you for all you have done, apart from last night. Your dress took careful planning. I had Catherine go to the village haberdashery has your sizes and let her order a dress that she thought would look beautiful on you. I have no idea what it looks like, except that it should be green... You do like it, I hope?\" \"It's gorgeous... Far too pretty for the likes of me.\" He shook his head. \"Nothing is too pretty for the likes of you. I would buy you a dozen more dresses if you let me.\" She immediately started protesting. \"I won't be a kept woman. I don't want your money. I don't want to be beholden to anyone.\" \"Janey, my sweet Janey. I know you don't want me for my money. And you don't owe me anything. I just … love you. I want to take care of you. I want to do anything to make you happy.\" \"It's not right...\" He so desperately wanted her to understand why he did it. So he pushed her. \"Why not? You take care of me..\"Why not? You take care of me. \"That's different. You pay me for that.\" \"Is that the only reason you do it? Would that stop if I ran out of money? Would you just run away and leave me?\" He knew the answer before she said it. \"No, of course not. I love you. And if we had nothing, I would still love you.\" \"I've been poor. Not any more though, as you have pointed out more than once. And so far I haven't done much with my wealth. All I ever wanted to do when I dreamed of getting rich was treat the people I loved. Which is you now. So let me treat you as well as love you. It's a selfish thing. Nothing makes me happier than you being happy. Please. Go try on your dress for me, and feel pretty in it. Don't care about practicality. Enjoy it. I can always buy you a dozen more. But I'm NOT buying your love, understood? When I give you something, it comes with no strings attached.\" \"You... You're... impossible,\" she breathed. \"I'll consider than a compliment,\" he smiled. After all, he had been called far worse. BineysThomas: Yes, I think we all would have liked for Thomas to make it out alive. Though I get the symbolism of it. TheLadyBookworm: I'm very glad you liked it, and yes we would all love our own Thomas... or Tom, I'm not fussy. I already suggested cloning. Smithsbabe65: It's very important to me Thomas finds his strenght, seeing it has eluded him for so long. I feel Lucille's torment was physical, where Thomas was mentally, and for him it did not stop when his parents died. Lucille may have meant well in the beginning, but she kept him down just as much as their parents did. So, did you like Laing?[Chapter 23] He really was impossible – impossibly kind, that was. She hugged him tightly, berating herself for her behaviour. \"Thank you.\" Going upstairs, she changed into her new dress and looked at herself in the mirror. The effect was astonishingly dramatic. Softly, she caressed the deep green satin. The fabric flowed, though it hugged her at the same time. It was no good for housework – she would be too afraid to spoil it. But she looked... absolutely beautiful. She had never felt like this – she was a lady, not a maid, in this dress. She could hardly believe it when she looked at herself. At the bottom of the stairs, Thomas was waiting for her. Even though he couldn't see he was beaming at her. \"Does it fit?\" \"Yes, perfectly. Thank you. It's gorgeous,\" she said, hugging him tightly. His arms encircled her waist.. She felt so feminine, so pretty. \"I wish I could see you. You sound gorgeous. But the dress is mainly down to Catherine. Come on, time for breakfast – you must be very hungry.\" He had finished making tea for her and put everything on the floor in the living room, like a real picnic. They finally ate.. She had to admit she was famished. And a bit exhausted maybe, too, after two weeks of doing nearly nothing because of her ankle, and then having the night of her dreams with this sweet angel. He did everything for her. She needed make it up to him She had been so… unkind. When all he wanted to do was make her happy. \"Thomas... I really mean it... Thank you so much. I'm sorry, I'm not used to people caring for me...\" He wrapped an arm around her as he drank his tea with the other. She loved being this close to him and couldn't suppress a need to be even closer. Was this love? Not being able to get enough of the other person?\" \"It's alright. I wasn't that used to it either, until you showed up and gave me my life back. And made me far happier than I deserve,\" he whispered in her ear. She turned around towards him, cupping his face.\"Thomas! Listen to me! You are very much worthy of happiness, and more.\" \"And so are you. So please, let me take care of you? I don't expect a commitment of any kind. I can understand fully why you don't want to get married. It's alright, I love you no matter what. Let's just be happy, together.\" There was a kiss placed on her bare shoulder, which the dress so beautifully framed. She felt like a princess, and he was a prince. Then again, she had felt like a queen in his arms last night. \"I don't need dresses for that though, or anything else. I just need you.\" \"And I you. But I like taking care of you, and spoiling you.\" She didn't know what to say, so she just kissed him. Happiness. It had always seemed so distant – so much so that she had stopped thinking about it, stopped seeing it as even a possibility. But yet... She was undeniably happy, here with him. Had she made a mistake by rejecting his proposal? Was she going to regret it in the long run? Was he going to use her and then spit her out? No, not Thomas. His only fault was too much loyalty, to people that had not deserved it. Had she deserved it? All she had done was her job... With great love and care, true. She loved this man – she could not help herself. From the moment she had walked in here, his gentility had been overwhelming. He might not have been what Edith had looked for in a man. She sought someone strong to oppose her, to fire her up and set her aflame. Thomas was nothing of that. He was terrible at opposing anybody, afraid of crossing them. Not because he was afraid of someone hurting him, but of him hurting someone else. And it was exactly that which had attracted Janey to him. Others saw a coward, but he was not. He was the bravest man she had ever known, and the kindest... and the most passionate. He was kissing her neck, letting his lips roam gently over her skin. There was no haste, though there certainly was an urge – she could feel that pressed against he thigh. How could she have ever conceived love could be this beautiful, with the examples she had had. She didn't fear him, even though reason almost demanded she should. She knew all the terrible things people thought he had done. She knew he had abandoned three wives to the mercy of his sister, and yet... he had done that out of love as well... and she knew what that felt like. She would have done anything for her mother, right up till the point she had been kicked out of the house. The fact was, though, that, after murdering her father, her mother had lost the power to love – not that there had been much to start with, but up till then, she had always protected Janey, like a wolf guarding her cub. Because of that, Janey had never really learned what love was. What if it turned out she was incapable? \"Janey, what's wrong?\" Thomas asked. See, it had already started. He was giving his affection and she had turned to thoughts of a horrific nature. \"Nothing.\" Her voice was strained, though, and, of all people, he would be able to tell. Of course, he was. \"You can tell me. You can tell me anything.\" He was looking at her with a pained, pleading expression. \"My mother wasn't able to love... What if I'm not either?\" she whispered, her eyes nearly watering. To her complete bewilderment, he started to laugh. \"What? Why are you laughing?\" He hugged her as tightly to his chest as he possibly could.\"Janey, that's nonsense. If I am certain of one thing, it is that you are very capable of love.\" \"But... I don't know how to love,\" she protested. \"You do know.. You love me. No one else did. I have been loved for my title, my looks, excitement, even for the man they thought I was. My sister... I believe more and more that I was a possession to her, rather than that she loved me. SHE was incapable of love, too filled by hate instead. You though, see me, for all that I am, and you still see a man you can love. You are more capable of love than anyone I know. You did not give up because you saw a broken man, you loved me in spite of it all.\" \"I loved you because of it. You are no more broken than me. But I carry a lot less resentment. I don't know how to forgive people.\" Good people didn't do that. \"You forgave me. Most people couldn't.\" \"You never did me wrong. Why should I hold a grudge?\" \"Ask the villagers that had ransacked this house before you arrived. I carry resentment too. I feel angry that people act like that. That's why I am afraid to let them. You are not, though. You go out there and...\" \"Give 'em hell?\" she interrupted him. \"Oh Thomas, I'm just as scared as you, most of the time. I just hide it differently. You though... You gave me back my faith in humanity.\" \"And you did the same for me. Don't we make a fine pair?\" He was still smiling at her. He was her strength, and she was his. Janey felt choked with emotions, so she could only nod against his shoulder. She held on to him tighter, which put him off balance, and his foot knocked into the side table. The table wobbled and then fell over, taking with it Thomas' digger model. Janey screamed and tried to catch it, but was too late. It crashed to the floor and was smashed to pieces. Thomas first reaction was to pull her closer, to shield her. \"Are you alright, Janey?\" \"No!...\" she cried out confused, \"I mean, yes. But the beautiful model you made... It's broken... Oh Thomas, I'm so sorry.\" \"It doesn't matter. Now, what did you say again about saying sorry for things that aren't our fault?\" Now he was repeating her words back to her? It was like their roles had been reversed – he was a force that was strong and steady, whilst she felt in utter turmoil. But he was right. No one knew what the future would bring. However, they both were more than capable of dealing with adversity. What she now needed to do, though, was to learn and to live with prosperity, for however long it lasted. \"We will try and mend it, alright?\" Just like their souls. Sparky She-Demon: I don't think Thomas needs to stay weak. And in some ways he never was. He survived all those years. That alone takes strenght. Zoe: Well I think you won't get your heart broken this time... Probably... Most likely Smithsbabe65: I like to think that because Thomas is so used to pain he is quick to spot it in others and he allows room for it. He is grateful for the love he gets from Janey, and is not gonna pressure her.[Chapter 24] Could life get any better than this? Thomas had finally let go of his feelings of imminent disaster. They didn't help. Yes, he still had a hard time believing Janey loved him. But she was there when he fell asleep... and was still there when he woke up in the morning, waking him with a kiss. She was so loving... she had no idea. More loving than all of his wives and his sister put together, though he hated comparing them. Janey was pure. She wasn't innocent. Too much had happened to her to call her that. She knew the dark side of life too well. Or, rather, she was innocent but not naive. Pure fitted her perfectly though – she was honest and truthful. Now that they could openly talk about what had happened to them in their lives, it took away the tension... It even slightly eased his guilt, though he still knew he was at fault for not putting a stop to it sooner. Janey had taught him, though, that what was done, was done. If he wanted to truly make her happy, he had to strive for happiness himself. He put his arms around her, kissing her neck. She let out a tired sigh, and he had a pretty good idea of what was the matter. \"What's wrong?\" he asked anyway, kissing her neck again and again until she turned around. She had been looking at the broken model all morning, trying to fix it. It was sweet, but it wasn't necessary. \"I don't know how to put this back together again, Thomas. I'm sor... Well, I …\" she stumbled, trying not to apologise. He smiled, hoping it would rub off on her. \"Hard, isn't it? Not apologising.\" \"Your machine model was beautiful, and it was something you had made. So, it was dear to me. I loved watching the detail of it. Even though I didn't know what it was for.\" \"It's a digger to pull up the clay. It is what I made my fortune with. Edith took it in production after... well, everything. Our divorce, my... accident.\" You couldn't really call it an accident, but it was too hard to call it an attack. After all, it was still his sister who had done it. Janey put her arms around him and kissed him, like she knew... Well, she did, of course. And she still loved him. \"Edith paid me very well for the machine, as well as for mining the clay at my ancestral home,\" he continued to explain. \"I know. Well, then it's even more important this model gets fixed. It represents how far you have come through hard work. It's something to be proud of,\" she said, turning back to the table. \"Let me try. I made every part of that machine. Maybe I don't need to see it to mend it.\" If he was honest, the machine did not mean much to him. It was part of his old life... the hardship... the pain. He had loved making it –,he loved creating things – but, without his eyes, it had little value. It was but a mere trinket. In touching it though, it was like he could see it again. He knew every little part and where it belonged. The images flowed together in his mind in three-dimensional shapes, Before he knew it, he was putting it back together again bit by bit, explaining every little detail to Janey as he went along. She had to be bored to death, but every time he stopped, she started asking more questions. She cared, so much... And he cared so much about her that he wanted to give her everything she wanted. Yet, all she seemed to want was him. He took a minute just to take her in his arms and kiss her breathless. The sound she made, the yearning moan, it was music to his ears... he loved her almost too much. The day she would leave him, he would die. But she was here, in his arms now, he reminded himself. \"Don't ever leave me...\" he whispered softly. \"Why would I leave you?\" Because he wasn't worthy. Because he had allowed monstrous things to happen. Janey seemed to have forgiven him for it, but he would never be able to do that. Still, he would not let it taint her life. As long as he could make one person happy, make her happy, that brought him more happiness than he had ever imagined he could find. If only there was a way to secure that happiness. As long as she did not marry him, if anything happened to him, she was entitled to nothing. It worried him and, even though he didn't want to push her, he wanted to do something to protect her. But what could he do? He had no idea of the state of his financials. He was well off, Janey had told him. He shuddered to think what Mrs. Allsop had done with his money in the years she had lived with him \"How rich am I?\" \"What do you mean?\" she asked, confused. \"Well, you told me a few times I could afford anything I wanted, live in a castle even, but I have never asked how rich that is.\" \"Why do you want to know? Do you want to move away?\" There was worry in her voice. \"Not really. I'm very happy here. The happiest I have ever been. I have become quite fond of this house lately, since you made those changes.\" He couldn't imagine himself living anywhere else any more. This place had become part of him. And not like Allerdale, which had felt like a hangman's noose. This home was a happy home. \"Good, because I love it here too,\" Janey hugged him in relief. \"I was just thinking, though. My needs are simple. You... Well, every time I try to spend money on you, you refuse me...\" \"I'm perfectly happy as I am, here with you,\" she cut him off. \"I know... I would like to make some provisions for you though, in case something happens to me. I want you to be financially sound so you wouldn't have to worry. I understand your reservations about marriage, but I want to make sure you are taken care of.\" \"Are you alright? You're not ill, are you?\" she asked worriedly. \"I'm fine. Never been better.. Never happier. Happiness without impending doom. It feels alien... It's like I'm waiting for...\" The words stopped there. If he said it out loud, it might happen. \"The other shoe to drop...\" she added. \"I feel it too. I always thought I didn't care what my mother said to me. She called me unworthy for so long, in so many ways. But I thought I had risen above that. I had told myself that she was a spiteful old woman, and she was wrong. But... I'm scared now that she was right. And that you won't find me loveable.\" He could set her heart at ease –,that would never happen. \"I love you more than words can say, Janey. You are all that matters to me.\" \"For now,\" she softly whispered. He hugged her tightly. \"Forever. Neither of us is perfect. But I think you'll find that I have many more faults than you have.\" \"No, you don't. You just had more things going on in your life. Your parents... They make mine sound like nice, civilised people. And I didn't have a sister who was...\" \"Crazy,\" he finally admitted. \"You can say it. Looking back, I feel like such a weakling.\" \"You're not. You survived it all...Without becoming like them. That makes you stronger than anyone I know.\" She kissed his cheek and he held her close. Whatever would he do without her? He hoped he would never need to find out. Sparky She-Demon : I get the reason for his death. It's kind of a death of innocence. When he finally open his eyes to evilness of his sister, his innocence is lost and with that he signs his own death. But still... It could have gone differently. Writingbliss36 : Glad you like my story and I hope you catch up soon Princess PrettyPants: Things are definitely looking on the up for them. Zoe: Alright I wont break your heart. But this story is about more than just sex, you know. lol smithsbabe65 : Babysteps for now, but bigger steps later as Thomas finds his stride. I am proud of my Thomas, I am.[Chapter 25] Janey had written to Edith to ask for Thomas's financial records. She knew his funds were more than sufficient, but she didn't know exact amounts. He deserved to know, and she was glad he was finally taking an interest. He needed to take his life back and this was a good step. She wasn't sure how she felt about him wanting to provide for her, though. She didn't want him to think for only one moment that she was only out for his money, but if something were to happen to him... Well, the first thing that came to mind was that she'd rather be dead herself. Did she really love him so much that she couldn't live without him any more? Yes. As incredible as it sounded, she could no longer imagine her life without him. He had brought her something she did not even know had been missing. Joy. And it made her blossom. She could see the changes when she looked in the mirror. She would probably never consider herself beautiful, but there was something there now, a twinkling... and, if she lost him, that spark would dull forever. Which scared her. Of course, she was moved by the fact that he offered to see her provided for... That she was important enough to him that he worried about what might happen to her after he had gone. But she didn't want to think of him dying – just the mere thought made her want to hold on to him tightly. \"Hey, what's the matter?\" he asked, laughing. He was in the middle of fixing up his model, doing way better than she had. With the little precision things, she would help guide his hand, but mostly it seemed his hands knew exactly what to do. To someone that didn't know better, it was like he could see again. \"Nothing. I just love you.\" Her lips sought a bit of exposed skin above his collar. He squeezed the hand she had wrapped around his waist. \"Am I boring you? I've been working on this model for hours now, and all you can do is sit and watch, mostly. If you want to go do something else...\" \"No, I love watching you work – it's amazing. And the precision you manage to work with... You are blowing my mind, my handsome man,\" she continued, kissing his cheek. He blushed. She noticed he did so every time she complimented him on his looks. But it was the truth. He was the most handsome man she had ever met. She could only imagine what he had looked like before... Not that he would have looked at her twice, back then. \"Yes… yes. It's surprising me too. But the machine – it's like it's etched in my brain. I know it so well that, when I feel the parts, it's almost like I can actually see them and where they belong in the model.\" \"That's wonderful.\" If she could give this man his vision back, she would gladly lose her own. It was like magic, watching him work, seeing him piece this delicate machine back together. He had such skill, such a gift, that it was a shame he could not continue his work for lack of sight.\"Why did you start inventing?\" He fell quiet, and she saw a slight tremble in his hands. Had she made a mistake? She hated seeing him pained like that. Demons of the past rearing their ugly heads. \"If you don't want to talk about it...\" \"It's ok... As kids, we weren't allowed to have toys. There was a toy room, but we weren't allowed to go in there.\" Janey gasped in shock. Not that she had ever had any toys. Anything of value would be converted into booze as soon as her father found it. The only possession Janey had managed to hold onto through the years was a bedraggled picture book of fairy tales. It had been so stained that it was worthless and, anyway, try as he might, her father had never been able to pry it from her. In fact, she still had it. She imagined what it was like to have toys but not be allowed to touch them. She knew about the violence that had happened in his home, but this… \"That's beyond cruel.\" \"Oh, our parents loved to find new ways to torture us, and each other. Mind games were just part of that. In fact, I can't remember a day in my childhood that I wasn't afraid. Not until they were both dead, anyway. And even that only lasted a week or so. After that, there was boarding school...\" \"Thomas...\" She clung to him, not knowing what to say for comfort. \"It's over. I know I'm safe now. But I started inventing because we didn't have any toys in the nursery. Just rubbish. My sister, she was more bold than I was. She used to sneak into that toy room and play with the toys, sometimes with me in tow. But my father could always tell – it was like he had rigged them so he could see when they had been moved. And then, when she finally got caught, he would thrash the life out of her. Which didn't stop her – she would go back the next day, even when I begged her not to... So I started inventing toys, so she would stay up there with me. To keep her safe.\" To keep his sister safe... And now he was trying to keep her safe. That was Thomas, always loving and kind. That was why she loved him so very, very much. \"I'm alright, Janey...\" he said patting her arm. \"Allerdale Hall is a long way away.\" The name was so familiar that she felt stunned. \"Allerdale? Near Workington?\" \"Yes. You know of it?\" \"That's where I was born. Workington. We moved away after father... died.\" Now it was her turn to look pained. Every time she talked about it, her stomach would still lurch, even after all this time. \"He worked in the mine... Your mine. How did I not realise this? You have a clay mine... my dad was a clay miner.\" It was incredible. \"You are from Workington?\" The shock on his face mirrored her own. \"I'm sorry.\" \"What for?\" How could he have possibly known she was from Workington? She had never told him \"I can't help but wonder... My dad poisoned the lives of those who worked for him. Made them miserable. Probably drove most of them to drink as well. I wonder if your father might have been different if he never met mine.\" \"That's not your fault… And I doubt it would have mattered. Even sober, he was mean. He had a huge cruel streak… he loved laughing about the pain of others. Liked causing it too – if he could play what he called 'a trick' on someone, he would be ever so happy.\" She felt bitter just thinking about him, and a shiver went down her spine. \"Mine too. They could have been friends, by the sounds of it. If my dad actually had friends... All he had was people that feared him. The word was that, the day he died, there was a huge fest in the village pub. Of course, by the time of the funeral, everybody pretended they were so sorry, but you could see them smirking.\" Thomas let his head hang, but his fingers interlaced with hers and she gladly squeezed them. \"I remember a funeral... I remember you! And your sister. There were lots of black banners hung around the village... a black coach... and you both were wearing black too, though your sister had a bright red flower pinned to her chest.\" \"My mother's funeral,\" Thomas confirmed. \"It was the first time she wore it, as defiance, because she had finally gotten rid of them. It would do her little good. The next week our uncle put her in a sanatorium.\" \"I must have been six or seven, and there was a procession through town. There was a carriage and behind it walked you. You looked like royalty. A dark prince... I was mesmerised. When you looked at me, I was sure you were there to take me away, and I tore myself loose from my mother to follow you as you turned the corner. She was ever so angry and came running after me.\" She couldn't believe it. That boy – that she had instantly fallen in love with – was now here. Was hers. The thought filled her with joy. \"I... I don't think I remember. Sorry... I don't remember much of that day. My sister and I were about to be split up. It was rather all a blur,\" he apologised. \"Don't be sorry. You probably didn't even look at me, but just in my direction.\" Suddenly, she remembered the eyes... blue, like the sky. One was duller now, while the other, the one above the scar, was black as the night. But they were still beautiful. He scratched his head. \"I wish I could remember you.\" \"Don't beat yourself up about it.\" She needed to change the subject... they had dwelt upon the past long enough. It was over, and here they were, together and happy. \"Are you alright, working on your machine? If it's bringing back bad memories, it's fine if you stop.\" \"Yes. I'm actually enjoying it more than I thought. When I did it in the past... I was always doing it for someone else. My sister... our home... the workers, many of whom had died in mining accidents. I wanted that to stop. I never really enjoyed it, because there was such pressure on me then. But here, tinkering away... It's just a shame I can't see it.\" \"Oh Thomas.\" She kissed him gently. He hugged her back. \"My life now is the best it has ever been. And I would gladly lose my sight all over again, just to be here with you. My worst regret is not being able to see you.\" \"Well, you are not missing much there,\" she replied with a dry laugh. \"Janey... I know I can't see you. But I know you are a stunning beauty.\" And that made her blush from her cheeks to her toes. Sparky She-Demon : Well they deserve happiness, so it is time they got some. Fandomenforcer : I can honestly say I have never thought about that. They would probably get it so right, so they would not return to earth. But Lucille deserves a chance to be reborn in a good loving family. Kaelmona: Glad you like it. Lucille was keeping him on a tight leesh to control him, but to me it was always clear he is bright and compassionate. And I am glad I get to write that part. Zoe: I gotta say it is always a bit weird to write love scenes, but I am glad you like them. I can't give you any spoilers though, so you will have to keep reading biddle29 : Glad you like it! .52: Thank you so much![Chapter 26] Thomas couldn't sleep. Somewhere deep in his brain, an image of Janey was buried, and he wanted it out. Even if she had been only six years old. He so desperately wanted to put an image to that beautiful voice. Janey was sleeping peacefully on his chest, cuddled up to him. No more nightmares so far, which he was very happy about. He hated seeing her miserable. She wasn't always as strong as she pretended to be – sometimes things got to her more than she liked to admit. But that was alright – he would always be there for her when she needed it. No matter what she looked like, she was beautiful to him. He simply wanted to know. So, it didn't really matter. But the fact that he had seen her... That there was a possibility of putting a face to her voice. He had imagined her so often... dreamed about being able to see her. And it turned out she had been in his head all along... a little girl looking up to him... reaching out to him. Well, there had been nothing he could have done for her at that age. He hadn't been able to stop any of it – his father's abuse... his mother's cruelty... his sister's murderous ways. What could he have possibly done for a little girl, whose father beat her and her mother... And then – suddenly – he remembered... There had been a little girl, with flaming red hair and big brown eyes. While everyone else had turned away their eyes in disgust when he and his sister had passed, she had not. She had smiled at him – a smile that carried hope, a connection... And now she was here, in his arms. Slowly, the image became clearer. There had been a woman too, her mother. She had red hair like the girl, but it was tucked away mostly, much like he imagined Janey wore her hair now when she went out. Her mother had been trying to make the girl turn round like everybody else, but Janey wouldn't. She had radiated like the sun in an otherwise dim landscape. It was like she was from another world... A sprite. Janey – it had to be. The grown-up Janey was murmuring. Not a bad dream, as far as he could tell... just unrestful. Still. He needed to know... Gently, he shook her until she woke up. She yawned loudly. \"Yes, dear?... Had a bad dream? Are you alright, Thomas? … Thomas?\" What had he done... This could have waited till morning. He had been selfish, just thinking about his own needs... he could have kicked himself. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. Go back to sleep.\" A hand stroked his cheek. \"You're lying...Tell me what is wrong.\" She knew him too well. \"It's stupid, really,\" he admitted. \"But it is still keeping you awake. Tell me what is wrong, Thomas.\" She kissed his cheek. He was so lucky to have her. \"Nothing is wrong. Just... Was your mother a redhead, like you?\" \"Yes she was.\" \"Do you look anything like her?\" \"Spitting image, apparently...Or so I have been told.. Except she wasn't as tall.\" There was something bitter in her voice. He understood. \"You are nothing like her on the inside. She was broken – you are not. You are so strong.\" \"Not always... Why do you ask?\" She rested her head on his chest. \"I have been thinking about that day my mother was buried. I think I remember you.\" He smiled. The picture of her was becoming clearer by the minute. \"You were the only one looking at me. Everyone looked away like my and my sister were... monsters. I guess they were right. But... as much as I hated my mother for the horrors she had put us through, I was immensely sad that day. We had become orphans and, though my sister was relishing the fact, I felt so alone. She didn't understand, and she even got angry at me. I needed a friendly face, if only just one. But everyone turned away, as if by looking at us they would take on our sins. And then, there you were. Radiant, with your flaming red curls, bright eyes, heart-warming smile.. you weren't listening to the poisonous words of others... You are beautiful, Janey Peregrine. You have the most beautiful and kindest smile I have ever seen. My own gorgeous sprite.\" \"I haven't used it much, though. There haven't been many reasons to smile over the years. Not till I met you... My handsome Prince Charming.\" \"I am not a prince.\" \"Well, if you keep insisting on calling me 'Sprite', we'd better find a pet name for you, my prince.\" \"Why? Does it hurt you when I call you a sprite?\" \"Oh no... I know you don't mean it in a negative way. Not in the way people used to call me witch... I feel flattered, magical even, when you call me a sprite. Just like you should feel when I call you 'Prince'. The six-year-old me lost her heart to that prince. And she was right. If only I had known then what I knew now, I would have run after you, hugged you, and never let you go.\" And little good it would have done. He had been shipped off to boarding school the next day, and Lucille to \"finishing school.\" It had finished her, alright – the last of her humanity had been removed there. He imagined what it would have been like if the little girl had put her arms around him. A warm feeling spread his chest... followed by an icy cold shiver, as he thought of what his sister would have done if she had seen that. He had been hers, and hers alone, after all, and she would not have stood for competition, no matter the size. \"Thomas?\" she asked, unsure. He realised he had been lost in contemplation. \"I'm alright.\" There was a shiver, though. \"Maybe we should be thinking of happier things than funerals. Like the fact that we are here, together. My six-year-old self couldn't be happier than knowing she got her prince after all.\" She kissed his neck and started pulling up his night shirt, crawling on top of him. \"I doubt your six-year-old self had that in mind, though,\" he smiled as her kisses grew bolder and bolder. \"True... But this girl wants you very, very much. Make love to me, Thomas.\" She pressed herself against him, grinding herself against his crotch – and he couldn't help standing to attention. There would never be a day he wouldn't want this woman. So, he relented. He let his hands wander under her nightdress, following her contours. She moaned and, grabbing his face, she kissed him. She was so different... so much more loving than he had ever experienced. Just like that six-year-old girl, she had a big heart and didn't care what the world thought about her. He wanted to keep her safe… to love her… to make love to her, forever. Just like this. She guided him into her. There was no rush, just gentle lovemaking, kisses and caresses. As he turned her to her back, he remembered the dream where he saw her, red hair spilling over the pillow. Red curls, brown eyes. It had been her, he realised. Somehow the image of the girl at the funeral had grown up. As if he had known it was her. Or maybe it just was because that girl was one of the few people that had ever shown him kindness, without asking anything in return. And he loved her. He had loved her from the first time he had seen her. Kaelmona : In the movie I very much got the feeling Thomas stayed in his own world to survive. That is why he never stood up to Lucille.. But this one has grown Zoe: Thank you so much! Biddle29: It's only getting better![Chapter 27] Janey was not feeling very well today. Not quite sick, but queasy. It had to be due to lack of sleep. Not that she regretted even a second of what had happened last night. Making love to Thomas was always fantastic and she couldn't imagine ever not wanting to be in his arms. She still couldn't believe this was the same boy she had lost her heart to so many years ago. The only man she had ever dared to love. It was silly – the boy she had only seen a minute at most as he had passed through her village had been her idol for years. When she was a little girl, she had thought so often about him, fantasizing that he was the prince that would come to rescue her from all her misery. Then, as she got older and learned more and more about the cruelty men put women through to feed their own pleasure, she had mostly forgotten about him. She had sworn off all men – off nearly all of humanity, in fact – letting only a very select group of people close. Mostly, though, she had kept people at a distance. It had left her lonely without realising it. And then she had come here, at Edith's request. A few weeks at the most, she had told herself beforehand. Just long enough to find her new employer a good nurse that could take over where Mrs Allsop had left off. From the moment she had seen him, though, she hadn't been able to leave. The fragility, but also the resilience in him, moved her. And she hadn't been able to help being attracted to him. Had that been because he had reminded her of that boy? His hair was just as black, and now the boy's silhouette started melting into that of the man before her. It was like it had been meant to be. Was that possible? She had never believed in fate, let alone love at first sight. Truthfully, she had not believed in love at all. But she loved him. \"Janey, is everything alright? You're so quiet this morning,\" he asked, tinkering away at his model. \"I'm fine, just a bit tired. Someone kept me up last night,\" she teased gently. He let go of the flywheel he had been working on to turn to her. \"I'm so sorry. I knew I shouldn't have. I just... I couldn't let it go. I know it's silly but to know I had met you... It's so important to have that image of you, knowing I will never see you.\" \"It's alright. I don't mind. I enjoyed myself quite well, thank you.\" She kissed his neck and let her head rest on his shoulder. The world was... not spinning, but uncomfortably wobbly, like she was at sea. \"I'm just feeling a bit off today. I'm sure I'll be fine again tomorrow.\" He pressed his lips to her forehead, not to kiss her this time, but to measure her temperature. \"You don't feel feverish... If you want to go and lay down, I'm fine with that. And if you think you need a doctor...\" \"No! I don't need a doctor.\" The words came out more resolutely than she had meant them to, but the man who passed himself off as doctor in the village gave her the creeps. \"Really, it is nothing... And last night was totally worth losing sleep over. If it doesn't pass, I'll go and lay down this afternoon, alright?\" \"You're important to me. You know that, right? So, I need you to take care of yourself,\" he insisted. She sighed, glad for his concern but unsure how to convince him she was fine.\"I will, Thomas. I don't feel that bad. Why don't we eat lunch outside today? The weather is lovely, and the fresh air will do me good.\" He got up from the table. \"I'll help you in the kitchen.\" \"No, you finish that model. You're almost done. And it works! I'm amazed of what you did...\" And there she became lost for words. Her stomach gave another lurch, and she clenched his arm. He gently finished her sentence.\"... without sight. You can say it. Thank you for giving me the confidence to explore the world around me again. You gave me life.\" She smiled. \"You did all the hard work yourself, do you know that?\" \"But without you, I wouldn't have even started.\" \"So, why don't you finish that piece. Then I'll make some sandwiches for lunch. I promise I won't strain myself.\" Janey wanted some time alone anyway, to compose herself until her stomach settled. Finally, he relented, and she went to the kitchen as he continued tinkering. A little helping of bread cut through the nausea and, once she was done making the sandwiches, she called Thomas to pick up the tray, not feeling quite steady. The realisation hit her that she now depended on a man that a few months ago couldn't even tie his shoelaces... She smiled, proud of his achievements. \"I made a mistake...\" he said, though, as he put the tray down. It startled her. \"Or rather, not a mistake, but I could have made it better. If I had angled that shaft differently, it could have taken a bigger load and dug deeper.\" Now she felt simply amazed. \"I have no idea what you just said, but why don't you try it? That... whatsit piece is broken anyway, so it needs to be remade.\" Once this project was done, this man would needed another challenge, she thought to herself. How he could have simply put all his genius on hold these past few years, she had no idea. \"I don't know if I have the tools or the materials,\" he sighed. \"There is a whole box of tools and materials in the shed – in a box that is marked with the emblem 'Sharpe and Son' – yours, I presume?\" she said, excitedly. \"It must be. I'm amazed Edith packed those, seeing the likelihood I would ever use them again was slim.\" Melancholy washed over him. He went back to a dark place... she could see it in his eyes. She caressed his cheek, trying to tease back the smile. \"She must have known they were important to you.\" He shrugged. \"To the old me, perhaps... It's not like I had much use for them lately.\" \"But you have now. Seeing what you have done already, I'm sure you can do this. And I can always help,\" she offered. He turned to her. \"What about your dreams, Janey? I'm sure being an inventor's helper was not on your list of dreams.\" And just like that, the tables had turned. He was trying to change the topic, but he also had a point. Her dreams... She had always been struggling to make it from day to day. She hadn't really thought about... dreams. \"I... I don't know. I love to learn. Anything, really. So, I like it when you teach me about your machine. So many men wouldn't, saying it was not a woman's place.\" Passion flared up in his face. Not sexual passion, but the one that came when someone truly immersed themselves in a subject. He had no idea how handsome he looked when he got like that. \"That's nonsense. You are bright and capable, and I value your opinion above anyone else's. And not just because I love you. I admire you for everything you are – smart, kind, compassionate... So... if you want to do more for women, fight for women's rights, I would gladly support you. I noticed how you stood up to that doctor, who was horrible… And I understand if you don't want to go back to him – though you are not going to ruin your health, understood?\" She laughed. \"You know me too well, Sir Thomas Sharpe.\" \"And I love learning more and more about you on a daily basis. Your dreams are my dreams as well so, if you need any help pursuing them, I'm here... Edith was very passionate about women's rights, too. Still is probably...\" he ended pensively. Janey wondered what he was thinking as he seemed to drift off. It struck her that he had not heard from Edith in five years. Did he still love her? Edith was her best friend, but... The quiet was getting painful, so she started speaking again. \"Yes, she is. And they are taking her seriously too, as one of America's biggest employers.\" \"Biggest employer?\" \"She took over her father's company,\" Janey explained. \"I thought she had become a writer. That's one of the few things Mrs. Allsop did tell me. I think she read the book and drew her conclusions it had to be about me and that I was a monster...\" He bit his lip as his face contorted in pain. That confused her. \"But the book isn't about you. It's about ghosts. There is a man in there, but he is nothing like you. Well, except that he is kind. But I don't think she particularly based him on anyone.\" And if she had, it was probably on Alan – not Thomas. \"She didn't mention me? In her books?\" He looked surprised. \"She writes fiction. Which means she might use experiences in her life occasionally, but the story is not based on real events. She told me your story in her letters, but never in public\" Janey wondered if she should read the books to him. Something had stopped her from doing it before. It was just too strange. Even talking about her friend with Thomas felt weird. Actually... it was more than that. Janey felt jealous, because Edith had had a part of him that she would never have. And that, in turn, made her feel guilty. Very guilty. After all, Edith had been married to him. And now... It kept Janey up at night sometimes, wondering how Edith would feel about her friend sleeping with her former husband. She didn't know how to tell Edith how she had completely fallen for the man Edith herself had once loved. She wondered how Thomas felt about it but feared the answer. After all, how could she ever compare to Edith? \"So, Mrs Allsop was mistaken?\" Thomas asked, timidly. Mrs Allsop – now there was a woman Janey had clear feelings about. And, if that wretched woman hadn't been dead already, Janey would have gladly wrung her neck. \"That woman was just a mean old bat that used and abused you. I read all three of Edith's books, and none are about you.\" \"And you say Edith is running her father's company, in addition to being a writer?\" Janey could not miss the admiration in his voice, and the beast of jealousy stirred within her breast. It wasn't fair. Still, even she admired her friend. \"Yes. It's her legacy, she claims. And the only way she can guarantee that her workers' lives will improve... I couldn't agree with her more,\" she said, suppressing her inner turmoil. \"I always admired her passion. I'm very happy for her that she finally gets to make a difference. If only I could do the same,\" he sighed. And though she admired Edith, Janey thought to herself that any difference Edith would make would never be as much as what the man before her could do. A clear sign that she had lost her heart for good. Well, she could live with that. \"You could make a difference... We could do it together, if you wanted...\" \"I'd like that,\" he said, emphatically. \"Where does one start, though? Who would I help, and how?\" \"May I remind you that you are a rich man? We will figure it out together.\" Her dark prince had turned into the kindest man in the world. What more could she ask for? Biddle29: Thank you... And ehm, no comment, absolutely no comment... Not saying a thing, nuhhuh Zoe: I love reviews, really. Can never have too many! So please continue. Smithsbabe65: Yay, you are back! And you still like me! Our lovebirds will be fine... eventually. I.C.2014: Glad you like it, but to know more, you just have to keep reading, dear.[Chapter 28] The alteration on the digger was so easy that he didn't understand how he hadn't seen it when he had first made the machine. He had tested whether the alteration worked... Well, he and Janey had. Very carefully, they had stoked the engine and then stood back as it reached full steam power. A repaired boiler was always tricky, even in miniature. The pressure steam created inside was strong enough to make it explode if there was a weak point, which could have easily been made in the fall. So, they waited a safe distance away for the machine to heat up and, when he was sure it was safe, he told Janey put it in motion. It worked like a dream, and Thomas was sure it would be able to dig far deeper with less effort. They had to tell Edith... So, this morning, they were writing a letter with a technical description of the changes that needed to be made. It was difficult. Normally, he would have made a schematic with measurements. He knew Janey was doing her utmost best to make a drawing and to write it all down, but it was hard for her. Not that she complained, of course. She was so dedicated. If anything, she encouraged him to tell her even more, questioning him, trying to learn everything he told her. It seemed unfair. He wanted to do something that was for her and her alone. If she would only let him. A charity was great, and he knew he owed something back to society he grew up in. His father had treated them like slaves... worse than slaves, even. Janey would tell him that it was not his fault what his father had done, but still... Once Thomas had finally gained ownership of the mine, he had done little to improve their lives, as he ran the estate. It had been hard times. Yes, he had a title and lands, but the Sharpe estate was near bankruptcy. He hadn't trashed his workers... But he had let them go to bed hungry many a night, when he couldn't pay their wages. The Sharpe siblings had been hungry themselves too, but was that an excuse? It was what had first sent them on a search for a wealthy heiress. And they had found one, who had been looking for a title to inherit. She had not been extremely wealthy, but rich enough to keep them comfortable if they spent it wisely. The problem was that his bride was not very wise and was very frivolous, spending her inheritance on every whim she could think of, before Thomas could stop her. Thomas wondered if his sister had planned to kill her from the start, or if she had been driven to it when half of their fortune had been blown by the silly girl. It didn't matter much in the end, he guessed. There was another reason he felt guilty. So far, he hadn't thought much about Edith. He had pushed any thoughts he had about her away since Janey had arrived. But now, writing the letter, there was no getting around it. He felt almost like he had betrayed Edith. She had divorced him, that was true. And he wasn't sad about that, not at all any more. Which was the problem in itself. How little had he loved her that it almost felt like he had forgotten her already? He had fallen for her goodness and kindness, and by god, the strength she possessed. Perhaps he had chosen her because she was so strong, that he had instinctively had known that she would be the one that could stand up to his sister, unlike Eunice, who had been as silly as they come. Had it ever been true love? It had felt nothing like the feelings he now felt for Janey. It was almost like Edith had been a childish infatuation, although he had been far from a child. It made him feel guilty towards Edith. He had put her through hell, and for what? But his biggest concern was that, in time, his love for Janey might also pass. Was it possible? Janey felt like part of him. Her feelings were his. There was an understanding between them that needed no words. It was deeper than anything he had ever experienced. She understood him, and he could tell her anything without fear she would judge him. It had liberated him in ways he could have never imagined. But still there was fear that it would all go away somehow, because he didn't deserve this. And he didn't want to put Janey through that. She deserved all the happiness in the world and he was already so inept in giving that. A darkness was passing over him, and Janey, ever observant, noticed. She kissed him and pulled him into her arms. \"Let's go for a walk this afternoon. We could both do with the fresh air,\" was her loving suggestion. \"Yes...\" he agreed. \"This letter needs posting, after all.\" \"You... you want to go back to the village?\" The surprise in Janey's voice was evident. He would have thought she would like a longer stroll, now that her ankle was fully healed. Of course, their last visit was the reason she had gotten hurt in the first place... \"Unless you are scared? I promise I will take much better care than last time. But you are right when you say I shy away from life too much. I want to… live again. Well, live maybe for the first time. With you... Lucille and I lived in a cocoon –-of a big black hellish moth probably, but a cocoon none the less – that shielded us from reality, fed her madness and blinded me from it. I won't go back into that trap. I want to take part in life, however much it scares me.\" \"I told you, I'm just as scared as you. And I haven't been I town since the accident...\" There were nerves in her voice, even. \"I'll hold your hand, if you hold mine,\" he said stretching his out. \"Alright, let me fetch my bonnet.\" She got up to get it, but he stopped her. \"Let your hair loose, my fiery sprite.\" His fingers combed through her soft locks. \"Thomas...\" Insecurity, again. How he wished he could see her and confirm what he already knew. That she was ravishingly beautiful. \"If anyone dares to tease you about your hair, I'll take them on.\" \"It's not proper for a woman my age to walk around with her hair loose. They will call me a harlot,\" she pointed out. He knew she was right, even if he didn't agree. \"Fools... Alright. I don't want anyone to hurt you. But know that I love running my hands through your beautiful soft hair.\" Janey laughed, and let her head rest on his shoulder as she hugged him. \"I love that too. Alright, no bonnet, and a simple updo. Let them say what they want about my red hair. If they want to call me a witch, well then may boils grow on their noses! You are right – we should both come out of our shell more.\" Fierce Janey – how he loved her! And he wanted to keep her safe. \"If you feel too uncomfortable about it, I don't want to push you.\" Maybe he had already pushed her too far today? \"No, you challenge me. And that's a good thing. You are not the only one that has past demons to battle. I just had them so well hidden that I had almost forgotten about them.\" \"I'm sorry for reminding you,\" he sighed. \"No, it was necessary. It was holding me back without knowing it.\" There was a little strain in her voice. She wanted to go, but he held her hand just that little longer, indecisive about whether he would let her get on with things, or if he would pull her back in his arms. Then she sniffed. \"Are you alright, my love?\" There was another sniff. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" He ran a hand over her cheek, which was wet with tears, and pulled her into his arms. She had gone from laughing to tears in mere minutes, and it worried him. This was not like Janey – she was definitely the more level-headed of them. \"No, you're not... you are crying.\" \"Just feeling a little emotional. I don't know what's wrong with me. It's just... getting to me today somehow. I'll be fine in a minute.\" She didn't sound fine though. She sounded exasperated with herself. He cuddled her close, gently pressing his lips against her skin.\"Let's have a cup of tea before we go. And, if you want to wear that bonnet, you can.\" \"No it's ugly, and you are right. No more hiding away. Neither of us has anything to be ashamed of. We survived. Nobody can hurt us any more, unless we let them\" She was now nestling herself in his arms, burying her face in his shoulder, and he let her be. He could feel she was wrestling with her demons... his taunted him on a daily basis as well. Suddenly, he was certain that he loved this woman... And that he would keep on loving her until the day he died. Sorry for the big gap, I started up a Night Manger fanfic called The Devil You Know on AO3 (because again, fanfiction does not have the category) But don't worry, Blind Monster will be finished biddle29: Thank you darling Hekka: Who said Alan married her? Not me! TapTapAlways: There is a real contempt by Edith for Thomas by the end of the story, I don't think that could have ever been mended. Zoe: Thomas is a liberal thinker. He was already very supporting towards Edith's writing career, and now towards Janey, so yes I would definitely see him support the feminist cause. Also being suppressed his whole life, I would think he knows the value of getting one's voice heard.[Chapter 29] What was wrong with her? Janey felt like she was changing. She didn't mind the changes – much good came from them. The loneliness that had haunted her throughout her life was gone. Thomas was there for her, and she was starting to trust him –something which frightened her to no end – but still, it was a good feeling. The thing was, though, that her emotions were going up and down, like a pendulum... They were sometimes overwhelming, which made her feel weak and vulnerable. And she didn't like feeling like that. She was safe with Thomas, she knew that. He would take care of her – protect her, even. He understood her pain... maybe even better than she did herself, at times. His own scars ran so deep, that hers seemed a mere trifle at times. She wished she could just take his troubles away, like he did for her. If only... The choked feeling returned again, and she blinked, willing the tears to go away. These emotional breakdowns had to stop. The cup of tea had helped, though. So had Thomas's strong arms around her. And now they were outside, slowly strolling to the village, the warmth of the sun seeping into her. She was feeling much, much better already. The world was pretty, the birds were singing, and the meadows they were passing were in full bloom. Next to her walked a man that loved her more than anything in the world and who was handsome and kind. Then why was there a sense of impending doom pressing upon her? Something big was about to happen, something that would change their lives, and she couldn't decide if it was for the better or worse. She just hoped everything would be all right. Lost in her thoughts, she stumbled, and Thomas caught her. This walk wasn't quite going as it should. Thomas was leading her, and Pilot… he was leading them both. She really had to get her head together before they reached town, because else she would put them all in danger. \"You are feeling better, right? Else, we can just head back and let the letter be collected by the next mail man that comes along,\" Thomas asked, worried. \"I'm fine... the fresh air is doing me good. Let's sit down for a minute,\" she said, feeling a little out of breath and out of sorts again. They sat down on a stone wall. All this nausea she had been feeling these past few days couldn't be good, either. And then there was this metallic tang in her mouth that made it worse. She probably should go see a doctor just to be sure nothing was the matter. But the idea of that man in town checking her out did not appeal to her. He was an ass. She had been drinking lots of chamomile tea, which kept the worst of the nausea at bay, but especially first thing in the morning, when she hadn't had any yet, she would be sick. It was like someone was kicking around in her stomach, making waves. Suddenly, she started to get an inkling of what was wrong. Of course, she couldn't know for sure, but it fit... If it was that, she could definitely not go and see the local doctor about it. Thomas kissed her cheek, which startled her. \"Are you sure you don't want to go home?\" \"Yes... the letter needs to be posted, and the walk is doing me good. Plus, I can't avoid the village forever.\" Last time they went though, everything had been different between them. She had still been his maid, not his lover. Looking back, she already loved him but had been far from ready to admit it. That had been a little over a month ago. Now perhaps... It was a frightening idea. How was she going to tell him? How would he react? She needed to think about it. Thomas in the meantime had picked up on her inner turmoil, she could tell, as he tried his utmost to cheer her up. \"Alright, let's make it memorable than. Let's do something nice. You could get a few extra new dresses to really shine. My treat,\" he suggested. She shook her head. \"Thomas! You know how I feel about that.\" \"And you know I just want to spoil you, make you happy, make you shine, and show you how much I love you. I have no ulterior motive. I don't want anything in return, except to see you smile... so to speak.\" It was so sweet. \"But I just need you for that.\" She grabbed his arm firmly, looking for something solid to hold on to. \"Listen, you got me spruced up. According to Catherine, I look quite dashing...\" He winked as he said it. She couldn't help but giggle. His antics were doing the trick – she was feeling better already. \"You do. You are very handsome,\" she confirmed. \"All I ask is that you do the same for yourself. And not worry about the cost. If you were my wife, I would buy you a thousand dresses. So please... Just one... Or two. I want you to feel beautiful.\" He was nearly begging he, and her resistance was diminishing. \"You already bought me one...\" she tried. It sounded stupid. He only wanted to do right by her. And maybe she was just hiding in her old dresses. The old Janey hated attention of any kind. Invisibility was safe. The new Janey... Well, she felt like she should make more of an effort to be worthy. Even if it was just for Thomas' sake, and he couldn't see it. It made him happy. And he looked so good, she should at least try to do the same. Plus, if she were honest, she really liked the dress Thomas had bought. When she put it on, she felt beautiful – for the first time in her life. A princess worthy of a prince... Of Thomas. Worthy? She hadn't even realised that she felt an inequality between them until just now. Where did that come from? Not from him, surely. He treated her with the utmost respect. \"Thomas, what do you think about me?\" she asked, nervous and unable to stop herself. \"I think you are the most amazing woman I've ever met,\" he answered without hesitation. It was the answer she was hoping for, but still that niggling voice of doubt in her head would not shut up. \"I am... from a very different social class than you are, though. My dad was a miner. Your dad was his lord and master.\" \"You know I don't care about that. Janey, where is this coming from? This isn't like you.\" He was right, it wasn't... and yet she couldn't let it go.\"I don't know. I just... I really don't know. We have led such different lives.\" \"Yet so similar... Janey, I love you. You and I... We are the same. You understand me better than anyone...\" \"But I am beneath you,\" she whispered, almost ashamed of her own insecurity. \"You know that isn't true. I am nobody. If anything, I am beneath you. You are so much better than me. Yes, I may have a title, but by the time I inherited it, we were as poor as church mice. And it means nothing to me now. Allerdale – my name. All it represents is misery. Is my title why you won't marry me? Because I would gladly get rid of it.\" Was that it? \"No. That's not necessary. I love you, Mr. Sharpe.\" The reasons for her fear ran much deeper and had nothing to do with social status. And yet... The idea of marrying him was getting less scary every day. This was Thomas, and she knew he would never hit her. \"So, can I please buy you a dress? Update your wardrobe, just like you did for me? I'll even let you pick it, seeing I'm not much use in that area,\" he grinned. \"Alright, one dress. I guess I'll have to...\" Though, if her suspicion was right, she wouldn't be able to fit in it for long. \"You don't have to, if you don't like.\" His eyes were begging her to give in though. \"I'm just trying to make you happy. Make you shine, because you deserve it.\" There wasn't anything wrong with a dress... She would look for something she could grow into in the next few months. \"I would like it. After all, with a handsome man like you, I'd better spruce up, or someone else may run off with you.\" He kissed the top of her head. \"Now that is something I would never do. I love you, Janey. No matter how you look, you are always beautiful to me. Now that may be an easy thing to say for a blind man, but it is the truth.\" \"Love you too.\"[Chapter 30] The carriage Thomas and Janey were in was rattling towards Allerdale Hall. About four more hours the journey would take, – they would arrive by nightfall. Edith was already there, waiting for them. She had arranged lodgings and would be there personally to meet them. It felt surreal. He hadn't thought this day would ever come but, as soon he had gotten her message, he knew he had no choice other than to go. Two days after they had sent the letter with an explanation of the improvements that needed to be made to the machine, an urgent telegram from Edith had arrived, telling him about the disaster that had struck the Sharpe Clay Mine. With the demands for the red clay running high, the dig had gone deeper and deeper, until finally... According to the telegram, there had been quite an accident. Ten wounded. Amazingly, there had been no deaths, but one man had lost a leg, meaning that he could no longer work in the mine – another family left without a provider. Thomas made a mental note that, once he was there, he would make sure the man was compensated. The incident had happened over two weeks ago, and the mine had not been in production since, which meant no income for the other families, either. Repairs were being made to the machine, but … it wasn't going as well as expected. Edith, who at the time had already been in London – he wondered if Janey had known this – had gone down to the mine to see if she could help, but there was little she could do, except reassure them their jobs weren't lost... and she couldn't guarantee that, to be fair. Not if the machine had been lost. Most of the clay deposits now lay deeper than Thomas had reckoned with when he had originally build his contraption. Plus, mending the machine was much harder than they had expected. Of course, this was not the standard machine that was now being produced in the Cushing factory and shipped all over the world. There were no spare parts – everything had originally been handmade by Thomas, so every part had to be remade like the original, and the one man that knew how – Thomas himself – was blind. He had no idea how much help he would be but, seeing Edith had personally asked for him, he was going to try to do some good. Plus, he owed it to his workers. Yes, officially, the men were employed by Cushing Co. but these were the men that had worked for his father... Thomas owed them a debt, and he was going to do his utmost to repay them. That was why he had come. It frightened him. It gave him nightmares – they had been terrible the past few nights, although he had tried to spare Janey, who seemed to have her own demons to deal with at the moment. She clung to him at night, thrashing and talking in her sleep.. Gibberish mostly, but it was clear that she was afraid of something. He could only imagine what she was dreaming about... It had started before they had known about Allerdale, and, when he had asked her about it, she had not answered him but changed the subject... which worried him even more. He wondered if he had done something to set them off. Maybe he shouldn't have dragged her with him to Allerdale. She had plenty of demons herself waiting for her once they reached Workington. But he needed her, in more ways than one, and he couldn't go alone. The accident had been on the same day the model had fallen. It had been a sign... he was sure of it. Allerdale was calling him back. And this time, he had to conquer his past, or it would forever haunt him. He was not the man he had been back then. He had grown, though most of that growth had happened in the past few months since Janey had come. Five years he had spent repenting his sins, but nothing constructive had come of it. He had wallowed and hidden himself in guilt and shame. How had that made the world any better? Because he was blind, he had considered himself useless. Without Janey, he probably would still be. But her encouragement had made the difference. And with that, he had gained a confidence he never knew he had. The blindness was almost a blessing. Without it, Janey would never have come into his life. She was huddled close to him in the carriage, holding his hand. He counted his blessings, with Pilot lying at their feet. The dog didn't like the cramped space and softly whined. Still, they couldn't have left the poor beast behind. \"Are you alright?\" he asked softly, barely audible over the rattling of the wheels. The carriage was plush – at least, it felt like that, and it had been sent to pick them up by Edith. \"I'm fine,\" she whispered \"You weren't sick again this morning, were you?\" She had been sick all week, which worried him, but she had insisted nothing was wrong and would not see a doctor. He wasn't going to push it but still... Maybe she should have stayed home. Maybe he should have gone alone... Though leaving her when she wasn't feeling well would not have been an option either. \"I'm fine, really.\" \"Are you scared?\" \"No.\" It sounded too sure. \"It's alright, I'm afraid too,\" he comforted her. \"Thomas, I don't know how to tell you this...\" The carriage lurched over a particularly large hump, and she couldn't finish her sentence. \"Don't worry. I'm not looking forward to this. So many memories... so few of them good. But I need to do this. I owe it to those workers to fix it. It's my duty. But, once it's done, I'm taking you home and spoiling you rotten. And you'll be fine. Edith is there too, and you are friends, right? She will be delighted to see you.\" \"Yes...\" Even more doubt. \"What's wrong?\" Suddenly he realised what it was. And he was worried about it too. \"How do I tell her that I'm in love with her husband? It feels like a betrayal.\" \"I'm sure she doesn't mind. Ex-husband. We are over, remember?\" Still, it was the same guilt he was struggling with himself. He expected Edith wouldn't mind but, for the off-chance she did, he didn't want to hurt her again. Even more, he didn't want Janey to lose one of her few friends. \"If you want to, we don't need to tell her, though. I love you and I am proud of you. But I don't wish to cause you or her grief.\" \"No we should tell her. I will do it... Gently,\" Janey said determinedly. \"It's better coming from me.\" \"I'll keep my distance until you do. For now, though, come here.\" He sought her lips. The carriage rolled on, though, and they nearly bumped their heads together. Janey giggled. \"Thomas?\" Janey asked. Something was clearly still on her mind. \"Yes, my darling?\" He safely kissed her hand this time. \"Never mind. It can wait. Just know I love you extremely much.\" He wondered for a moment if he should pursue it further but, as she snuggled up against him, he decided to let it rest. Past demons would soon resurface. She would tell him when she was ready. Sorry for the long silence, working hard on other things totally unrelated to writing. But I am back! And this will get finished.[Chapter 31] Janey couldn't tell him, not now. Thomas had been fretting for two whole days now, from the moment they had gotten that darn telegram. He wanted to do the right thing. And yet, he was so scared – she could tell by his whole demeanour. He didn't need her worries on top of that. Plus, she still needed it confirmed. Edith's friend Alan was with her, and she knew he was a doctor. She wonder if he could perhaps check her over. Janey had never met him, but Edith trusted him completely, so she knew he would treat her with respect. At the same time, he was Edith's friend... Would he keep quiet? Doctors were bond by an oath, but she could not be sure this man would keep it, seeing his close relationship with Edith. Which meant Janey was going to have to tell Edith herself, before telling Thomas. Women talked about these things amongst each other. Maybe it wasn't so strange when you told your best friend before your man. But, then again, Edith had been married to that same man. It was all so complicated. She wouldn't change a thing, but... When exactly had her life turned into a farce? She laughed despite herself. It was all too ridiculous. \"Feeling a little better?\" Thomas asked immediately, hearing her laugh. \"A little.\" What else could she say? There was no doubt in her mind, though, that she had to tell Edith everything. And Thomas too, as soon as she knew for certain she was indeed with child. But not now. He was about to face his past demons, and she could see the tension in his face. He wasn't the only one. Workington made her nervous as well, she had to admit, but it had been a long time ago. A lifetime ago, it felt, though she could still hear her father's hard words... could still hear her mother's cries. For Thomas, it was much fresher. Much more brutal. He had lost his sight here. His family had died here, their restless spirits still wondering about. The stories Edith had told her about the house being haunted sent shivers down Janey's spine. At least the weather had been fair today, and hopefully it would stay that way. The world looked cheerful, and the summer blooms in the field were waving at them, their glorious colours taking her mind off what was to come. Yet, those ghosts were just around the corner. Janey started to recognise the terrain and had to try hard not to ask the driver to turn about. It was useless anyway; they would need to stop soon The sun was going down now and, even though it was just a few more miles, it would probably be dark by the time they arrived. Perhaps it was best they arrived under the cover of darkness. She was worried about Thomas. He had not been sleeping well. His past ghosts had not been leaving him alone. Still, it was the ghosts of the present she worried most about. How were the town's folk going to react to the return of their former landlord? He was there to help them, but they didn't know that, and even if they did, they might not believe it. People here could be harsh. They hated people sticking their nose into personal business. They loved a scapegoat though. As if her home situation wasn't bad enough, people had loved calling her a witch and a devil's child, blaming random misfortune on her red locks. She had gotten chided for things beyond her fault for as long as she could remember... And it had all started here. She wondered if the villagers had changed, now that no Sharpes presided to watch over it any more. Not that she imagined that, when Thomas had been lord and master, he had been anything like his father... If anything, he was more like her, and the villagers had probably blamed him for all that was wrong in their lives. Rumours of what had happened up at the house surely had made their way to the village in distorted terrible versions. And now an accident with the machine he had built... they were likely to say he had done it on purpose – a flaw set to kill them on a later date. She knew their way of thinking and it terrified her. Thomas was the perfect scapegoat for their anger and, if they were to go after him, he would never see an attack coming. She feared for his safety. She loved him too much to let anything happen to him. She would stay with him, no matter what. Pilot would protect them both. \"Janey, are you sure you are alright? One minute you seem fine, and the next... You're shaking. I'm not beyond turning this carriage around and going back home if you're not well.\" \"No... It will pass. Besides, we are almost there, and it's almost dark now. It would take us all night to get back. Edith has arranged rooms for us. We will just get some sleep and we will see in the morning, alright?\" That seemed the sensible thing to do. \"Whatever you want.\" he assured her. She sighed and let him cradle her in his arms. It was another twenty minutes until they arrived, and Edith was waiting for them. She hugged Janey immediately as they came out of the carriage, greeting her long-lost friend. \"It's so good to see you Janey! Your rooms are ready. Did you have a good journey?\" Janey noticed Edith hardly paid any attention to Thomas. It was like she was wilfully ignoring him, even though Thomas was the reason they were here. Strangely, it hurt Janey – she felt torn between her friend and the man she loved. She nodded to Edith, grabbing Thomas by the arm, involving him. It was only natural, considering that was the job she had been originally hired to do. \"Good evening, Edith. It is evening, isn't it? The journey was fine, thank you for sending us a carriage – I don't think we would have made it here in a stagecoach,\" he said as if he had been addressed. Had he noticed Edith's cold demeanour towards him? He probably had – that man heard every intonation of voice, and he could probably sense the icy silence that followed as well. A blond man Janey had never seen came bounding out of the house as well and started to take down their luggage. \"Thomas, thank you so much for coming. I hope you can help us. We are in rather a pickle, as you English like to call it,\" he said, sounding overly amicable and, well... fake. It gave Janey shivers, and she wanted to stand in front of Thomas to protect him. \"Alan?\" Thomas asked, rather curtly. \"So, you're still around.\" It had been in the letter, but Janey had not read it out, deeming it unimportant. \"Someone has to look out for Edith's best interests.\" There was an undeniable chill in the air now. \"You're Alan?\" Janey asked, surprised. Edith had talked so much about him over the years, and with such fondness, that she had expected him to be... different. Nicer. Of course, so much had gone on between these two men. There was bound to be bad blood. But still... she didn't like the way he looked at Thomas. StaticMissi : Yesyesyes![Chapter 32] When Thomas got to the mine, he realized he was glad to have Pilot with him. Not only did the dog stay close to him and guide him, but it was a comfort to have him there. Thomas had never thought of Allerdale in terms of smell... If he thought about his old home at all, it was always in pictures... it was like the place was etched in his mind. But now... it was all so familiar – the earthy smell of the soil, the juniper hedges, the rusty tang of the machinery, the petrol, even the smell of dust and decay on the wind. He hadn't remembered them but, being back here, it all hit him, and all the memories came flooding back. Thomas fought back tears... he fought back nausea. Why had he come here? What good could it do? \"Thomas, are you alright?\" Alan asked, grabbing Thomas's shoulder in an affirmative and what should have been calming manner. It spooked Thomas, and Pilot barked. Thomas sat down by the dog and wrapped his arms around the great hairy body. Whether it was to calm the dog or to calm himself, it wasn't clear. Pilot immediately licked his face, and Thomas felt himself relax. \"It's alright boy. I know this is a strange place, but we will get through it.\" He wondered if the dog could see the ghosts that haunted these grounds. Because he was sure the ghosts were here. Despite the sun on his skin, there was a chill in the air. But he had come too far to turn back now. He was here to help. He wanted to put the past behind him and leave a legacy of good, after all that his family had put the workers and their families through in all those centuries. \"I still don't see how you can help, if you can't see a thing,\" Alan scoffed. This man certainly was no comfort to have around. \"I know the machine like the back of my hand. It's all there in my brain. And, as a doctor, you should know that, once you lose your sight, other senses kick in.\" \"Well, by the sound of Mrs. Allsop's reports, they didn't kick in until now. So, you get a beautiful new assistant and all of a sudden you learn to 'see'. I don't buy that.\" \"Beautiful new assistant?\" Thomas asked \"Miss Peregrine. You don't fool me, Sharpe. There is nothing wrong with your sight. I see you walking around here. You can see just... fine.\" The last words came out strained. Thomas felt something swoosh past him. Had Alan just tried to land a blow on him? Surely, he wasn't that childish. \"She is beautiful. Inside and out. Incredibly intelligent. She gave me back my independence.\" \"So why is she hanging around with the likes of you?\" \"I don't know. I care for her very much...\" \"Like you cared for those other women? The ones that died only because they loved you? Does she know about what you did?\" \"Those days are over. Lucille is dead... Janey knows everything that happened. Edith had told her already before she came, and I have answered any questions she had.\" \"And made her fall hopelessly in love with you...\" The disgust in his voice was clear, but he wasn't wrong. He could not deny it. \"That... just happened. Her past... we just have an understanding. Don't tell Edith yet... Janey wants to tell her. Don't ruin their friendship… she has so few friends already.\" Alan raised his voice further. \"And whose fault is that? Her father's death. Marrying you. Divorcing you. She is a social pariah, even though it is all your fault. She tells me she is happy this way, that she doesn't need fake friends, but how can she be?\" He did not understand. \"What? Oh you are talking about Edith. She IS happy that way. She never cared about social convenience... she does what she wants. You of all people should know that by now.\" \"Edith, yes – your wife. Have you any idea how hard it is for her to see you?\" Thomas could not see Alan's face, but he could hear the anger in his voice. \"My ex-wife – she chose to divorce me,\" Thomas corrected Alan. \"Which I fully understand, but that is besides the point. She asked me to come here and that is why I came. Because I owe it to her, and to the workers down that mine to fix this problem. It was Edith's choice to be here – I would have been fine with just Janey by my side.\" In fact, he would have been better. Everything was unnecessarily complicated because of this situation. Which probably needed to happen at some point. He knew they have to tell Edith about their love someday. But now it was all the more difficult. \"You fancy that red-headed tart, don't you?\" Alan snarled. \"Don't talk about her like that. She is Edith's friend, remember?\" Thomas felt so useless... Janey was being insulted but he just stood there uable to defend her. \"Some friend she is, running off with the likes of you like a common slut,\" Alan continued. This finally made Thomas snap. In one sudden move, he managed to throw Alan to the ground. Pilot, beside him, was barking like mad. Thomas held Alan by the neck. \"You want a piece of me? Then hit me! Don't hurt her. You don't know what she has been through.\" He was breathing hard. Realisation struck about what he was doing. The man beneath him was breathing hard as well, so at least he was still alive. As Thomas loosened his grip, though, the tables were turned. \"YOU NEVER LOVED HER! NOT LIKE ME!\" Alan shouted, moving so that now he was sitting on top of Thomas. He felt the weight shifted as if he was getting ready to throw a punch. Edith. He was still talking about Edith, Thomas realised. Pilot barked, and Thomas realised he needed to talk Alan down, or the dog would attack. \"I loved her, but not as I should. My loyalty was torn from the start, and she deserved better. I can never amend that. That's why afterwards...\" He paused. \"I did everything she wanted, so she could move on. I want her to find happiness. I really do.\" \"Like you have? You don't deserve that girl. You don't deserve anyone,\" Alan spat at him. \"I don't...\" Thomas agreed. \"But Janey does. And if there was anything I could do for Edith, I would.\" Alan's voice turned desperate. \"She... doesn't want anyone. I try to let her know I am there for her. I try to help her. But every time I do, she just pushes me away. Insists on doing it herself.\" The grip on Thomas was released, and the weight lifted from his body. Alan helped him up to a sitting position and sat next to him. \"She is like that – she is independent. If you truly love her, you have to accept that,\" Thomas stated. \"I just want to help her. She is all alone in the world, and a woman. She needs someone to protect her. To look out for her,\" Alan said quietly. The fight was out of him now. Thomas sought Alan's shoulder and patted it. \"And she has that in you. But you have to accept the fact that she is an independent and strong-minded woman. That is what makes her who she is. That is the woman you fell in love with, and you don't want to change her. Do you?\" \"I love her for who she is, but I sometimes fear for her safety. She is a woman, in a man's world that does not always look kindly upon her feminist ways. I want to protect her.\" \"And let me guess, she hates that?\" Thomas knew Edith well enough, to know that she would not like that. Neither would Janey, for that matter. \"She does. She tells me to go away, in no uncertain terms. How do you accept that, knowing she might get herself hurt?\" \"Acceptance of my fate has never been a problem. If anything, I was too complacent. But I am learning to get over that. And I know what you mean. It's harder when you are trying to protect someone. But at least you are not in the middle.\" \"Then you haven't heard yet how my mother feels about me being with Edith. She says I have thrown away my life and my reputation by associating myself with 'that woman', as she calls her. It's horrible. If only Edith would say she loves me back.\" Alan sounded defeated. \"She hasn't?\" Thomas started to feel sorry for the man. When he had left Edith, he had always assumed it was only a matter of time until Alan and Edith would get together. \"She... she lets me feel like she does sometimes, when she isn't cross with me. We have been... intimate – I can't believe I am telling you this...\" \"It's alright.\" Thomas wasn't sure if he wanted to hear this, though. He felt no jealousy, but it was awkward. \"She never said she loved me, though,\" Alan admitted. \"But you still love her.\" Thomas could hear it in the way Alan spoke about her. Alan sighed deeply. \"I would marry her tomorrow if she would have me.\" It struck Thomas how unique his relation with Janey was. \"And if she wouldn't marry you? But still loved you?\" he asked \"I guess...\" There was doubt in Alan's voice, though. \"I put her through a lot. I can understand her not wanting to give up her independence again, to any man,\" Thomas said. Maybe Edith and Janey were more alike than he had realised. \"I don't want to take that from her,\" Alan protested. \"But you would anyway – it's how the law is arranged.\" \"I wouldn't... But I understand. Um... sorry for attacking you.\" Alan got up, dusting off his clothes. Thomas could feel Pilot brush against him. All was calm again.\"It's alright. I probably had it coming.\" Alan started laughing, softly first, but then louder and louder. It was infectious, and Thomas started to laugh with him. The whole situation was just too absurd. \"I can't believe I just took advice about my love life from you.\" Alan sounded astonished \"I can't believe you took it... And about Edith, no less. I always expected to fight you over her one day.\" Thomas cleared his throat self-consciously. \"Well, we almost got there. And you are right. So, you are over Edith? Completely?\" Alan still sounded insecure. Thomas paused a moment, trying to come up with the right words. \"Yes, I am. Don't get me wrong, because I did love her, and I still care for her well being... So don't think you can go breaking her heart, cuz you'll have me to reckon with, young man,\" he said, adopting a fatherly tone for effect. \"But I am not in love with her. Alan laughed again. \"I wouldn't hurt her. Ever. Not after having waited so long. I just want her to be happy.\" \"So do I. And if that is with you... It pains me to say it, but you are a good man, Alan. Better than me. So make her happy.\" \"I'll try. I'll try my darndest.\" Alan stood up from the ground and then helped Thomas up, brushing off the dirt as they continued to the mine. They made quite a pair... Quite a pair indeed. Hint: Don't read all quietly... I still like reviews![Chapter 33] \"So, what is going on between you and Thomas?\" Edith asked as soon as the men had left, which made Janey conveniently choke on her cup of tea of tea. Of course, choking was never good but, as she was coughing, at least she had time to think of an answer. She had to tell Edith everything, but simply blurting out 'I'm in love with your ex' seemed rather harsh. She could feel the heat of her embarrassment rise through her cheeks and hoped Edith wouldn't notice. \"Are you in love with him?\" Edith pried further. Janey had meant to tell her as soon as possible, but not like this. In her mind, she had run through hundreds of scenarios, but none of them had been this confrontational. Maybe she should have expected it from Edith. One of the qualities Janey admired in Edith was, after all, her blunt honesty, but still... She tried to gauge her friend's mood. She looked so… happy. But Thomas had been hers. How could she be? \"We have... Fallen in love.\" There, it was said. She couldn't even look Edith in the eye as she said it, though. Edith clapped her hands, before embracing Janey tightly. \"That's wonderful. You went so quiet there for a moment that I was worried you weren't getting along even. I'm so happy! I knew you would be perfect for each other.\" Wait... Janey pushed her away, staring at her friend. \"You did? Did you... set us up?\" \"Well, not like that. I just thought that, when I asked you to work for him, you two had a good chance of understanding each other, since you both had difficult childhoods. And maybe something might blossom eventually. By how protective you are of him, and he is of you, it looks I was right, wasn't I? Oh Janey, you of all people deserve some love. And Thomas, despite his many faults, does know how to give that.\" Janey couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"So you did set me up.\" A bitterness filled her. She didn't like the idea of someone trying to run her life. It reminded her of her mother... And that was never good to think about. Thomas was her choice, nobody else's. The idea it was all pre-arranged filled her with disgust. \"Only with the best intentions. And only ever as a vague possibility. You just seemed to fit together. As friends at least. And maybe more.\" Edith had clearly meant well. Janey knew that, but still her friend had no right... \"So what did you think? Let's put the two broken people together, maybe they will make one whole person?\" The idea made her sick. And yet, it was what had happened – better even – both were healed. Mostly. Some scars would run too deep for even time to heal them. But she could deal with that, as long as they had each other. Thomas wasn't here right now, though, and her best friend did not feel like her friend at all right now. \"No, that wasn't it.\" Edith protested. \"I don't know why, but you two just seemed to fit. I thought you would be happy there. Safe. Thomas would never push himself on you, I knew that. He is way too weak for that, especially now.\" Edith might have gotten it right that they belonged together, but she clearly didn't know either of them. Janey's mood darkened further. \"He isn't weak. He is a survivor.\" There was a scornful laugh. \"By taking the easy route, closing his eyes for the things he doesn't want to see,\" Edith said, dismissing the remark. Janey shook her head bitterly. She had never seen Edith as a privileged princess, but that was exactly how she was behaving. She had been in that house – had she not seen how it had infected them, poisoned them... had she no mercy? \"Sometimes that is the only way to survive. You truly don't know what it is like to be put down on a daily basis. To get blamed, even if you have done nothing wrong. There comes a point where you are left with two choices: you either think, to hell with it, and go your own way, damn the consequences, or you become invisible. Neither way is right. But that is what you do.\" \"And they were? Different sides of the same coins. They couldn't help themselves. Is that what you mean? Lucille the extrovert, Thomas the introvert. Well, Lucille tried to kill me, and Thomas did little to stop her. Whatever their past, it does not absolve them.\" Edith was cold and haughty, and Janey was feeling desperate. Why did Edith hate Thomas so much? And if she did, why had she sent Janey to him? \"But he did stop her. Or tried to. Against everything he had ever known.. Everything that was safe. Against the wishes of the one person he had loved all his life. Have you any idea what kind of sacrifice that was for him?\" \"She was a monster. Has he told you about her?\" \"Some, not much. Enough to understand what it was like.\" \"You have no idea. She was crazy. Killing everyone in her way, including my father. She smashed his skull in on the sink with what Alan called inhuman strength.\" It was obvious Edith blamed Thomas for that as well, even though Janey knew he had only known about it when he saw the body. \"But she was crazy. Thomas told me how their father hit and abused her. How their mother struck her and put her down. They sent her away for shock treatment! It would drive any person crazy in time. Yet, through it, all she tried to protect her little brother.\" \"So, what makes you think Thomas isn't crazy? He lived through all that with her,\" Edith pointed out icily. Janey bit her lip.\"Who says he is sane? Who says I am? We live with the scars of what happened to us in our youth on a daily basis. We fight to stay alive, experience happiness, whilst the shadows of the past constantly lurk over us, trying to pull us back. We survive, because that is all we can do. But somehow... Somehow Thomas managed to keep his humanity. I sometimes feel dead inside, you know. I could care less about the world. But he cares. Always. And he made me care again. He makes me feel alive.\" Edith looked at her friend with wonderment. \"You truly love him. More than I ever did.\" \"I do!\" Tears were streaming down Janey's face. \"I loved him from the first day I saw him, not knowing the connection. So, I guess you were right.\" \"Janey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.\" Edith rushed to her side, placing her arms around her. \"I think I'm pregnant.\" The words came out before she realised she had said them. \"Thomas?\" Edith asked, surprised. \"Of course. Who else?\" \"You slept with him?\" \"Yes... Sorry.\" Great. Now she felt guilty after all. \"No... That is fine. It's a relief.\" That made Janey mad. Now it all of a sudden sounded like Edith had pimped her out. A feeling of discomfort crept back again. She didn't want to speak out, though, so she shrank into a ball. \"It means he has moved on,\" Edith continued. \"No longer stuck in a past that cannot be. He is finally over me.\" It sounded haughty, like all Thomas had been doing in the past five years was pine over her... Had he been? Thomas had been wasting away before. For the first time, Janey regretted not asking him about Edith before. Thomas told her he loved her all the time, but did he still harbour feelings for his former wife? Would he want her back, given half the chance? \"I should have known it. You are looking so much better than the last time I saw you. Look at you... you are radiant. Really...\" Edith said distantly, stroking Janey's back. Janey wanted to push her away. It felt like they were actors in a play. Still, this was her best friend, whose husband – ex-husband – she now was in a relationship with. \"I haven't told Thomas yet. About...\" \"I see. Are you afraid how he will react? I doubt he will be angry,\" Edith responded. Angry? Janey hadn't even considered that reaction. But what if he was? With his background, she could understand if he never wanted children. Janey had never wanted children, up till now. But, knowing a piece of Thomas was growing inside of her, blossoming despite all the anguish they had both gone through, made her want to protect and cherish this life. Thomas, though, was so afraid his family's madness would spread... What if he didn't want the child? She needed to tell him and soon.

Eli: Yes, we are almost there.[Chapter 34] \"So, the safest entry for the miners would be under the house?\" Thomas asked again, speaking to the men standing around the table in the working shack. The mechanics on-site had easily understood the alterations he wanted made on the machine, and they assured him that they could now handle the repair themselves, which was a relief. They had come up with a different problem though... The entry shaft for the mine had become unstable, and the accident had made it unsafe to continue digging from there. The shaft had weathered away, much like Allerdale itself, only it didn't have the mansion's solid granite walls to hold it up. As the men had suggested the idea of tearing down the houseever so carefully, Thomas knew they were right – Allerdale was the safest point of entry. The walls in the basement had been fortified – it was probably the only reason the mansion had not sunken away in the mud. Besides, the house had been placed on top of the mountain, which meant having the entry there would make flooding in the shaft nearly impossible. There were actually old tunnels from the mansion into the mine already and these were, according to the men, more stable than their current entry shaft. \"But... we would need to level the mansion. It isn't safe to enter, and the work we would need to do would only destabilise it more. We are very sorry, sir, but, if we go that way, the building has to come down,\" the foreman explained to him. \"Right...\" Thomas couldn't have cared less about that. In fact, he would have been happy to tear the place down. But, he couldn't help worrying about Lucille – he was sure her ghost was still there. Lucille had always been so attached to this place. Despite the horrors, or maybe because of the horrors, she had insisted on staying here. It was like she wanted to let the house know she had mastered it... But the fact was that it had always been the boss of them. No matter how they tried to repair it, it only fell apart faster, even with all the money they poured into it. Lucille had sacrificed three of his wives to this cause and would have done the same with Edith. Thomas had always seen the house for what it was – a pile of misery. He had been happiest when they were away from it, seeing the world. His sister would get so miserable, though, that she literally would make herself sick so they would need to go home. Now she was dead, rotting away in the dirt much like the house was. \"It's your home, sir. There may not be much left of it... Most of the windows are broken now. That freak hail three years ago left the roof full of holes, like God tried to shoot it down himself.\" The other men mumbled, and Thomas had a feeling they were crossing themselves. Thomas would not have been surprised if the Lord had taken his wrath out on the old mansion.\"Freak hail?\" he asked, wanting to know more. \"Yes – luckily, it didn't reach the town, or lives might have been lost. Happened one night just after we had clocked off. Most of us had already gone home but me and Pete were still clearing up, you see... We hid underground until the sound of pelting stopped. When we came out it looked like a battlefield. Icy stones the size of a child's fist. The machine didn't have a scratch, but the house... Carnage. Sorry, sir... it mustn't be nice to hear that about your home.\" \"It's alright... Can I still get in?\" A resolve started to form in his mind. He would let the house be demolished, but not without saying goodbye. He owed Lucille that much. And the other ghosts that dwelt there. He had to give them the opportunity to leave. \"In what, sir?\" the man asked, bewildered. \"The house.\" \"Well, I suppose you could, but I wouldn't advise it, especially with your… condition. It isn't safe.\" By the tone of his voice, it was clear the man considered Thomas mad to even consider it. \"I know every inch of that house. It won't be a problem, I can get around by touch. You can demolish the house, but I would like to visit it one last time... Lay some ghosts to rest.\" He had the feeling Lucille had been with him since he he had come, anyway. \"Let me come with you,\" Alan offered. \"No, I won't risk anyone's safety, including yours,\" Thomas replied determinedly. Unaccompanied he made his way into the house. He ordered Pilot to stay outside, afraid that the dog might hurt himself .Even though he couldn't see, he knew exactly where he was as he made his way around. Th smell... he had never noticed them whilst he was living here, but now they were so familiar... It was the smell of... decay. And it had been part of him for so long. But not any more. Whatever happened, he never wanted to live in Allerdale Hall again. The place had only caused misery and grief, since the day it had been built. Even the ghosts would be better off – they would be free as soon as the building was demolished, Thomas reasoned. It had been cold and damp here for as long as he could remember. The attic they had been banished to had been draughty and, as he had been little, Thomas had been sick often. It was amazing he had made it to adulthood. And, if it hadn't been for the loving care and attention from his sister, he probably wouldn't have. She had not always been a monster. There was good in her. When he had been sick, she would be by his bedside around the clock to take care of him, feed him, wash him, read to him... do anything a loving mother did for her child. Only, he wasn't her son, and their mother wouldn't even check up on him. One time, he had heard his mother speaking to the doctor about his health. She had asked him if her son was about to die. When the doctor had told her that Thomas was, in fact, on the mend, there had been a disappointed sigh. Thomas loved Lucille. He probably always would. She was his sister, and she had loved him when no one else had. She had taken care of him and, in her own sick and twisted way, she had always done what she thought was right for him. She had started becoming possessive at one point though, and it had been so gradual Thomas hadn't even noticed it. He saw it now, and he saw the damage it had done to both of them, but still... He couldn't blame her. As he made his way up the stairs, he heard a rumbling in the distance but paid no heed. Thunder seemed to belong to Allerdale, especially in summer, though it usually only came in the evening. The stairs were proving harder to climb than he had expected. Even these boards had started to rot now that they were no longer in use, and he carefully needed to find his step. The house was even colder than he remembered – the cold was wrapped around him. As if... Lucille had her arms around him, her head resting on his shoulder. Whispering her name, he made his way from room to room, tears streaming down his face. He wanted her to haunt him... he wanted to talk to her. Bumping into a desk, he finally stood still. And then he realised where he had gone. This was the last place he had seen, before... He had known she was going to lash out at him before he had entered the room. Deep in his heart, he hadn't expected to survive. He had betrayed her and had been willing to pay the price for that. Still, there had been no other choice. Edith had not deserved to die. Nor had any of his previous wives. It had taken him far too long to take charge of the situation, but finally he had, and it had cost him his sight. For a long time, he had wished it had cost him his life... but not any more. It seemed there was a plan for him after all. He could atone for his sins, make a difference... with Janey. \"Brother... I need to see you,\" a very familiar voice whispered. There was a loud crash. And then the floor gave way. Eli: Well ehm... Obviously? I don't think I could end the story without her... But not there yet. Princess PrettyPants: I can only say... Sorry? Guest: I'm so glad you like it.[Chapter 35] Thomas woke up but, as soon as he did, he noticed something was amiss. This world didn't feel right. It was a dream... Or worse. He was still in the office, and his sister stood before him. He could see her... He could see, he realised,! but the things he was seeing were not possible. Lucille was dead... but there she was. Pale and slightly see-through, like a ghost, though not the horrible ghosts Edith had described. There was no blood, no gore – Lucille looked as beautiful as she once had been, only not quite corporal. \"Am I dead too?\" he asked. His sister shook her head but did not speak. \"Is this a dream?\" he asked again. She shook her head again. It made no sense, but nothing here seemed to. The fact that she seemed unable to speak worried him, as if she really were a prisoner in this house. Thomas looked around him. He recognised Allerdale, but it no longer looked the same. The house looked ghostly as well. The walls were there, but they were no longer solid. They shimmered. He could see from one room into the next, yet he could not. All in all, the house looked much better than he remembered it. No more broken windows, wallpaper that was coming down, or wisteria eating up the walls. The gilded mirrors had regained their shine, and the furniture was no longer looking frayed. It looked like the house Lucille had wanted it to be. However, it still felt extremely cold. Even though the signs of decay had been there since Thomas had been little, now the house seemed returned to all its splendour. This was how it once must have looked, long ago when it was first built. Perhaps it was a reflection of how the house saw itself – young and beautiful – not the old and decrepit mansion it had become, like an old woman who could not reconcile herself with the image she saw in the mirror. He noticed there were other people there as well, moving through the house on different levels. His mother. His father. His wives. But also unknown men and women, who seemed stuck in this place. Some were dressed in clothing that seemed as old as the house itself, which made Thomas wonder if it really was the house that had poisoned them all those years. It wouldn't have surprised him – as a child, he had gotten many a nightmare where the house was a large black moth, sucking the life out of him. There were no moths here, though his parents, dressed in brown and black, looked just like the dark winged creatures of the night. He ran through the house, yelling at the people. \"Why are you all still here. Go. Leave!\" He felt like crying, but no tears came. It was like a stone lay on his chest. The ghosts heard him, and all turned towards him one by one. As they stared at him, there was no expression on their faces, as if all emotion had been sucked out of them. All but his sister. She didn't look as maniacal as he remembered, though. There was concern in her face, real concern. This was the face of the little sister that had nursed him for weeks at a time. When she had still been pure and innocent... before their parents had beat it out of her. \"Am I really still alive?\" he asked, worried Lucille shrugged, then gave a small affirmative nod. \"You have to leave this place, you know that, right? It's doing you no good. It's making you unhappy. Just like...\" when she was alive, he wanted to say, but he couldn't. \"Just like it always has. It poisoned us as we were kids... And then we let that poison seep into us. We did horrible things to keep it going. No wonder the soil is red... this house really is build on blood. No good can come from this place. Let it go, Lucille. Find happiness. I'm free now, I found happiness beyond these walls. Break this bond. Take my hand and I'll come with you.\" Lucille shook her head and pushed him back. Then, something happened he had never expected to see. Enola came forward and took Lucille's hand. The hatred between the women seemed gone. Pamela came and did the same. So did Margaret. The women seemed to have united. One by one others joined. Everyone took each other's hand and formed a chain. Everyone except his mother and father, who refused to move. Lucille opened her mouth and seemed to shout at them but there was no sound. They didn't listen either. Both started to make their way to the centre of the house, to the grand fireplace. As they saw each other, their neutral expressions changed to hatred. The fire in the hearth started burning brighter and brighter, until it fully engulfed their parents. And then suddenly it was gone, and so were they. Turned to ashes, it seemed. Thomas looked at his sister and smiled. They were gone. They really were gone. The first ghosts moved towards the door... and left. They wandered down the hill, out the gate where they disappeared into the light. One by one they all disappeared, as Lucille and Thomas watched them. \"You should go as well. There is nothing here but pain.\" Enola, who was last to leave, nodded and took Lucille's hand. He had wronged Enola so much by marrying her. She had not been the prettiest girl, but she had the kindest heart out of all of his wives. Even when she had found out about the baby, she had tried to help. And now she and his sister were finally free. He walked with them out the door. As they left, he turned to look at the house one last time and saw that the walls had started to collapse; one by one they fell, until there was nothing but rubble. It was like a weight was being lifted from his chest. He turned around to his sister, ready to leave with her, but she stopped him. \"Go,\" she motioned. \"Go back.\" Thomas wasn't sure what to make of it. There was nothing to go back to – the house had been destroyed. A woman with red hair and following a large dog ran past him, into the wreckage. He recognised her instantly. Janey! He ran after her but his head started to feel different. It throbbed and he fell down as everything went black once more. Weight was put back in his body, substance. Then, all of a sudden, it was like a blockage was removed. He opened his eyes... And there was light... Searing light – it hurt his eyes, and he blinked. People were yelling, but he couldn't make it out right now. There were shapes, colours... a fiery red standing out above the rest. \"Janey... You're beautiful,\" he smiled. His body was in pain but he could not feel it. She was there. There was a frown on her face – she looked worried. \"Thomas, are you alright?\" \"Fine... More than fine. It's a miracle. I can see, Janey! I can see you.\" He wanted to reach out to her, but his body did not want to comply, and his vision was blurred for a moment. Janey came closer. \"What are you talking about?\" she asked in disbelief. He grabbed a strand of her hair. \"You're even more beautiful than I imagined... I'm not dead, am I?\" \"No, you're not. What are talking about?\" she asked again. The words did not seem to register with her. A flash of blond and blue – it was Edith, pulling Janey away. \"Let Alan have a look. He is a doctor. It's not safe for you here.\" Alan came into view as well now. \"I'm fine, really,\" Thomas tried to push him away. He wanted to see Janey. He had tried to picture her every night, and now he could see her. No one was taking that away from him. The doctor took no heed. \"No, you're not. Your leg is still trapped and that beam was on top of you.\" \"But, I can see!\" Thomas did his best to look past Alan. He didn't want to see the golden-haired doctor. What he wanted to see was his red-headed sprite. \"Stay still,\"Alan pushed him down. \"Janey!\" Thomas cried out again. \"She is here, but at a safe distance. Hold still.\" \"I need to see her.\" He had no idea how long his sight would hold. If this was his only chance, he needed to make the most out of it. Alan continued checking him. \"You can't. The building isn't safe and could collapse at any moment. There was a lightning strike that started a fire; it miraculously put itself out, but there isn't much left of the building. It isn't safe to be here, certainly not in her condition. You don't want her to get harmed, do you?\" Thomas fiercely shook his head, so much it made him see stars. He wondered what was wrong with her that Alan spoke of a condition. Had she hurt herself trying to find him? Either way, harming Janey in any way was out of the question. \"Just get me out quick, please.\"[Chapter 36] When Janey had heard Thomas had been trapped in the house under all that rubble, her heart had nearly stopped. A lightning strike had hit the mansion and, fragile and decrepit as the building had been, it had crumbled down entirely. Nobody had been supposed to go into the building, but Thomas had anyway, to say goodbye, apparently. Janey could understand that – there were plenty of ghosts she would like to put to rest, if only she could muster the courage. However, she could not understand why anyone would have let a blind man go in that house alone. It wasn't safe and, as soon as she had arrived at the site of the collapse, she had scolded Alan for allowing Thomas to go by himself. She didn't trust the man... she hadn't liked the way he had looked at Thomas over breakfast and sneered at him. However, Alan had looked as shocked as anyone – maybe even more so – and had already been digging through the rubble, looking for survivors. It had all happened a little after midday. Janey had felt sick to her stomach as she had heard the loud crash of thunder, which brought back vague memories of last night's nightmares. She had dreamt that Thomas had been hurt, and… something else… oh, why couldn't she remember? The sound outside had been so abrupt – she had known something was wrong. Lightening makes a different sound when it strikes something, and she could tell that this bolt had found a target. However, it had not been until she had seen Pilot that fear had really grabbed hold of her heart. The dog had come back to the inn alone, running back and forth, barking like mad. Her heart had leapt into her throat, and she had dashed after the big dog, with a bewildered Edith in tow. Although she hadn't seen Allerdale in years, as she ran up the hill, she could clearly see that something was wrong. The house had fallen in and there was smoke coming from the pile that was left. Some men were staring at the pile, others frantically moving about. She had spotted Alan, who immediately ran towards Edith, apologising to her. \"Thomas went into the house alone. I should have never let him go, but he wanted to say goodbye before it was torn down. He insisted no one went with him. And then out of nowhere, lightning... Oh god... I'm so sorry...\" Edith had looked at Janey with big eyes, but Janey had pushed her friend aside, wanting to know only one thing: \"Where's Thomas!\" He was hers. Nobody else's. Edith didn't care about him – Janey did. And she wanted answers. No one knew what had happened to him, though, except that he had been inside as the building collapsed. They were searching but had had no luck so far. Janey had felt at a loss, wanting to cry, wanting to search, wanting it all to be untrue... She could not lose the only man she had ever loved. And then Pilot had ran off into the mayhem. She had called him back but he had held his ground on top of the rubble and barked again. She had instantly understood that Thomas was there. Running up the mountain that once had been a house. she had pulled stone after stone away... and then, there he was. People had been yelling at her to come down, that it wasn't safe, but she didn't care. She had seen him – his eyes had fluttered a moment before opening fully and then... He had seen her. Not just looked at her, but seen her. The realisation needed time to sink in. She still could not believe it now as he sat in his bed and stared at her with big eyes. She was actually in the hallway, as the doctors had told her he needed to rest, but that didn't keep him from staring at her through the window in the door. He had not taken his eyes off her since the accident. When she was in the room, he looked at her like a man possessed... drinking her in. So much so that the doctors had asked her to stay away to speed up his healing process. She had done what they had told her, staying mostly in the hall of the hospital as Thomas lay there, his eyes begging her to get closer. She felt like a monster, and all she wanted to do was be with him. The doctors had no explanation for the sudden return of his sight – mystified, they were afraid that he would revert to his blind state. Although they said he needed rest, they kept doing test after test. What did they think they were going to achieve? Janey was feeling more and more aggravated by the minute. Thomas had his sight back – for now. If he lost it again, she doubted the doctors could do anything about it anyway, given they had not been able to fix it the first time around. It was amazing how well he had come out of the wreckage of the mansion that once had been there. Even though the ceiling had collapsed on his head, he had no broken bones – just scratches and bruises. For once in his life, Thomas Sharpe had been lucky. And so had she. If she had lost him... she shuddered at the thought. She needed to talk to him, even though she was afraid of his reaction. Now even more than before. After all, he had his sight back... why would he want to stay with her? She knew she wasn't beautiful, and the way he gawked at her probably meant he was wondering why he had fallen for her in the first place. She was, however, carrying his child. Being in hospital, she had made full use of the opportunity to have her pregnancy confirmed with some simple tests. She was having a baby, just like she had thought. Edith knew... as did Alan. It seemed Edith had told him as soon as she had arrived at Allerdale, which had angered Janey immensely. Edith said she had done so for Janey's own good, as seeing Janey claw through the rubble had frightened her, but Janey didn't care much about Edith's excuses. It was bad enough that Edith had known before Thomas, but Alan? She didn't even like the guy and neither had Thomas, though they seemed to be getting along now. She could see another doctor was attending to Thomas now. How much longer was this going to take? How long were they planning on keeping her away from Thomas? She just wanted to see him, to know where they stood. But how could she if she was condemned to wait endlessly in the hallway? To hell with it. She barged into the room, determined not to let anyone stop her this time. The doctors looked at her. Thomas looked at her. \"Hello, beautiful,\" he said, smiling and looking straight at her. She blushed, feeling uncomfortable in his presence again. Would she ever get used to this? She hadn't realized how safe she had felt in his blindness, when she was not being judged for her appearance. Of course, his words just then were a positive sign, but still... She knew she wasn't pretty... not with that red hair, and limbs that were just too long. She wasn't like Edith, who was petite and dainty in a way that made grown men protective of her. Of course, Janey could take care of herself – she had been doing so for years. But the way Thomas had taken care of her when she had hurt her ankle had been wonderful... beyond what she had ever imagined. His arms were safe... sheltering. It was a feeling that was so unfamiliar to her... she had fought the world for as long as she could remember but, with Thomas, she didn't need to. He was there for her... protected her... accepted her for who she was. And that man was still in there, she reminded herself. Still, she couldn't help being terrified that it would all change now. What would a man like him ever see in a girl like her? Still, he was there… his hand stretched out to her... motioning for her to come nearer. \"Don't worry, I won't break,\" he assured her. In contrast, she felt like she might shatter into a thousand pieces at any minute. Still, she sat down on the bed next to him. If only all these doctors would go away so they could talk. \"What is wrong? You don't look yourself.\" \"And you know what that looks like?\" She smiled a little. With a soft chuckle, he grabbed her hand.\"No, I don't – you are right – but I know what you sound like. And you sound like there is something wrong.\" \"I...\" She hesitated. There was no way she could tell him with all these people around. \"I just want to go home.\" \"Me too.\" Thomas looked at his doctors. \"When can I be released? It's been three days and I still have my sight. There is nothing wrong with me except from a few bruises.\" \"Well sir... we would need to deliberate...\" one coughed. At that point, the doors opened and Edith barged in. \"Thomas, can we talk?\" Edith asked. \"In private.\" She threw a deliberate look at the doctors who all scampered. \"You too, Janey. You can come back later.\" Janey fell speechless, being reprimanded like that. She bit her lip, wanting to say something, but nothing came. Not knowing what else to do, she shuffled towards the door. And with that, Edith had managed to do what Janey had been trying to do for days. Guest (and everyone else reading) : Sorry for the delay. My editor was very busy helping me with another project and she had a huge workload on top of that so things took slight longer than expected Princess PrettyPants: Well, *whispers very softly*, I was hoping for a happy ending... But if you insist? The Raven May Fall : No amputatition needed[Chapter 37] Thomas felt rather cross. He had finally managed to get Janey to sit with him, and Edith had just driven her away. He had been terribly afraid to close his eyes these past few days – fearful that, when he opened them, his sight would be gone again. So, he had stared at Janey every time she was near, imprinting every detail of her in his mind – her soft green eyes, her copper curls, the blush on her cheek, the curve of her lips. He could stand going back to being blind as long as he had her image printed into his soul. But Janey seemed to be keeping her distance, like she was scared of something. Of him. He hated to see her like that. He want to hold her, take her in his arms and drink in the sight of her, but she was hardly there and, when she was, she stayed on the other side of the room. So, he was quite ticked off with Edith. Whatever she had to say, she could have done in front of Janey, he thought. \"What do you want, Edith?\" he asked, trying to keep the irritation from his voice. \"Alan said you wanted to demolish the house. Are you sure?\" Edith asked. She seemed slightly nervous, though Thomas couldn't for the life of him understand why. \"Yes. It's my past and it's no longer part of me. Besides, there isn't much left of it now, is there?\" He had not been able to take a good look when they had pulled him out of the wreckage, but he had seen enough to know the mansion had collapsed entirely. He had been lucky to make it out alive. Or perhaps it wasn't all down to luck. Lucille had done what she always did – protect him. And Janey had taken over after that. His guardian angel. \"What about the ghosts? Wouldn't the miners be at risk?\" she asked. He shook his head. \"Lucille is all right with it. She left, and so did the others. No one that visits the ruin now will be at risk. Not from ghosts anyway.\" \"How do you know?\" There was a worried frown on Edith's face. Thomas knew that, if anyone would understand, she would. So, he told her what had happened. Most of it. \"As I was buried under the rubble, Lucille visited me. She was at peace. I have never seen her so calm. She looked like she was ready to move on, and so were the others. It was like the house was holding them, but as it fell down, they were freed... And so was I. I never knew how... it was like it was holding us all back. Do you think that is possible?\" \"With Allerdale Hall... Probably. Being here is hard, you know? So many horrific memories.\" She pulled her arms around herself defensively. He was starting to feel sorry for her. \"So, why did you come here? You could have stayed home and saved yourself a lot of heartache.\" \"I had to be here after the accident. I'm not the kind of boss that doesn't care. And I also wanted to know if Janey was alright with you. Which she clearly is. You love Janey, don't you?\" The look on her face was so intense that it made him shiver. He had no idea how far Janey had gotten in telling her, but there was no use lying. \"Yes, I do.\" \"I'm so happy for you.\" She was smiling now, relieved, which made him relax as well. Thomas was as surprised at this statement as Janey had been. \"You are? You're not mad?\" \"No. Why would I be? We were never meant to be. The more time passes, the more I realise that I might care for you as a friend, Thomas, but I stopped loving you a long, long time ago. You two are perfect for each other. I knew that when I asked her to take care of you. So, when are you marrying her?\" She looked pleased, almost smug. Thomas sighed. \"I don't know if that will ever happen.\" \"Is it because of me? Do you still have feelings for me?\" \"No... I... When you and I fell in love, it was with the illusion of each other, not the real person. I see that now. All the secrets... They ruined us before we even got the chance to know eachother. With Janey, there are no secrets. I would love to marry her. I don't think she wants to marry me, though. I can understand why...\" Edith looked confused. \"But she told me herself your past doesn't matter to her.\" \"It's not my past that is preventing her from marrying me. It's hers. She does not want to be bound to a man. I understand. It's not a big deal. I love her no matter what. If she needs her independence to feel safe, then I happily will give it to her... Though I could use your help with making sure she is provided for if anything happens to me. She doesn't want me to – she doesn't want to think about it. But I could have died in that house, and she would have been back where she started, penniless.\" \"I promise that will never happen as long as I live. You should sit down with a lawyer to arrange something like that. I can arrange that.\" \"Thank you. It would be a great relief to know Janey was provided for. I know she won't like it, but I want her to have it all if anything happens to me. My family, what is left of them, really doesn't deserve a cent. They could have helped us as children, but instead they raided Allerdale of it's valuables. Janey... I know she would give most of it away, which is fine, but see to it she keeps enough for herself, please?\" \"You're not dying just yet, you know.\" Edith patted his hand. \"No... But I could have. Life is so fragile. Janey can lead her life however she wants but I want her to be able to be independent. I'd give her the money now if she would only take it.\" Edith sighed deeply. \"I wish Alan was as liberal as you.\" Thomas shook his head. \"Edith, you should really give Alan a chance, you know. Either that or cut him loose. That man dotes on you. Follows you like a puppy. It's not fair on him to let him hang like this. It's been over five years. If you can't love him, let him be free to choose someone else.\" \"But I do love him. He just… After all this time, he still treats me like a child. Like I'm not capable of making my own decisions. It... argggh... It drives me mad.\" Edith paced the floor as she spoke. \"I know he loves me, but he can't stop babying me. I'm a famous author and I run a successful company besides that. It wasn't easy taking over my father's company, you know. No one would take me seriously. But I did it anyway. And I made a success out of it, partly because of your invention, but partly because I am my father's daughter as well. It's in my blood. And now I'm at the head of one of the most profitable companies in America. But when Alan sees me, he treats me like a weak, feeble-headed woman. Everything I do, he tries to interfere with. I know it is because he wants to protect me, and I love it when he takes care of me, but he can't belittle me. It's utterly ridiculous and it undermines my authority, completely.\" \"Have you told him that?\" It was a simple enough solution, and Edith was a smart woman. She looked surprised though. \"No.. Do you think I should?\" \"The man isn't clairvoyant, Edith.\" In fact, Thomas found Alan rather thick at times. But the one thing Thomas was sure of was that Alan was devoted to Edith and loved her with a passion. And he was a good man. He had moved heaven and earth to save her, and Thomas was pretty sure he would do it all again if it was called for. Alan deserved some credit for that. \"Talk to him.\" Edith giggled. \"When did you get so wise?\" \"Janey has opened my eyes in more ways than one.\" He thought about where he would be now without Janey. So many times he had almost lost the will to live, only his cowardice holding him back, but now... The world was new, and he had gotten the second chance he had never deserved. \"You two are perfect for each other. You are absolutely fine with her not wanting to marry you?\" The way she said it, made it sound like Edith could not believe men were capable of such a notion. \"Why wouldn't I be? I don't need to own her. All that matters to me is her love. And I know I have that.\" Edith shook her head. \"Alan would never go for that. He wants a good little housewife, like Eunice is. She has gotten married, by the way. Three children they have already. Spoiled brats... even Alan thinks so.\" \"Talk to him, Edith. He might surprise you.\" He thought about the passionate way Alan had spoken to him at the mine. He had sounded like a man that would do anything to win her love. \"But what if I lose him?\" Edith worried. \"He crossed an ocean to save you, even though you had rejected him by marrying another man. He stayed with you for five years after that, even though you never told him you loved him. You are divorced, which is scandalous enough. Knowing his mother, he must have gotten a lot of flack for that. The boy is persistent. He won't give up on you now, trust me.\" \"You're right... So, I should tell him?\" Was she asking him now? \"Yes, and be gentle. He loves you, but he may need some time to get used to the idea of taking a step back. Like you said, he is just trying to protect you.\" Edith threw her arms around Thomas. But it wasn't a lover's embrace – it was the hug of a good friend. \"Thank you, Thomas. Now, go find that lovely lady of yours. I know she wants to talk to you. I'll talk to the doctors and get things ready for your release. And I'll contact my lawyer today so you can set up that will. But if you ever do get married, I expect to be invited.\" Thomas was so relieved – everything that had weighed him down through the years had been resolved. The scars were still there, but he could live with them. All he wanted was to be with Janey right now. He smiled at Edith. \"I'm so glad you're alright with us.\" \"She makes you happy and, more importantly, you make her happy. Just know if you ever hurt her, I will hunt you down and kill you,\" she said, raising a finger in warning. \"I wouldn't be able to live with myself anyway. Janey is special... Not that you weren't, but...\" It wasn't Edith's fault that she had not been the one. \"We were never right for each other. I fell for a man that was never there in the first place. I should have never made you into my champion.\" She sounded so… defeated. \"I'm sorry about that.\" He didn't know what else to say. \"Don't be. It wasn't just your fault. I was blindingly naive at the time. You were like a dream, a handsome prince coming to sweep me off my feet. I swore I never wanted any of that, and yet when you came along I was like a lovesick puppy. \" \"I'm sorry,\" he said again. \"Its alright. Just promise me you will keep on making Janey happy. She so deserves it. I led a golden life compared to hers. I was always loved. You two, you never had that. That's why I asked her to go to you. If anyone was going to understand her, get her over her fears in life, it was you.\" Thomas couldn't believe it. By sending Janey, Edith had shown more faith in him than he had in himself. \"You weren't afraid I was going to hurt her?\" \"No. It took me a while to realise it, but you were innocent during that time. You were just stuck trying to make the people you loved happy. Lucille took advantage of that.\" That wasn't quite fair. His sister wasn't a monster... Or perhaps she had been at the time of her death, but... \"Lucille didn't know any better, either. If you knew the things Father did to her... And Mother. And, through it, all she tried to keep me safe. And succeeded, mostly.\" \"I didn't know.\" There were tears in Edith's eyes, now. \"I do feel sorry you know... That I killed her.\" \"You had no choice. She wouldn't have stopped until you were dead.\" He hated to admit it... But that was also what had cost him his sight. \"I know. But that doesn't always make it easier. It still gives me nightmares.\" \"As it does me.\" He took Edith in his arms to comfort her, softly stroking her back. She soon pushed him away, though. \"I'll be fine in a minute. I feel relieved, in a way. I'm glad we had this conversation. It's like a weight has gone.\" He felt the same way. For the first time in his life, he felt true freedom. No more house, no more obligations from the past. He could go where he pleased. Do whatever he wanted to do. But there was only one thing he really wanted. \"You're sure?\" he asked, not wanting Edith to be in distress. \"Yes. Be with your love and make her happy,\" she smiled through her tears.

We are fiv years after where Crimson Peak ends and they have not spoken since. Issues have festered between them and they are getting resolved finally.[Chapter 38] With Thomas talking to Edith, Janey had gone for a walk to let Pilot get some necessary exercise. The dog felt cooped up and uncomfortable – and, frankly, so did she. She had watched them for a minute, Thomas and Edith, wondering whether she should go back in. But Edith fitted so much better with Thomas than Janey did. Edith and Thomas were from the same class, had the same level of intelligence. And Janey? Janey was just a servant, just like her father had been to Thomas's father. A miner, a maid... People in the upper class only used people in the lower classes for basic needs. Sharpe Sr had never looked twice at her father... But Thomas was different, wasn't he? He cared... he truly cared. He didn't see things like social class... Of course, so far he hadn't seen anything at all. Even if they had gotten disapproving looks, he would have been none the wiser. But now... All she wanted to do was hide in his arms, but everything seemed different now. She had hardly spoken two words to him since his accident and his miraculous recovery. And just when they had been about to, Edith had sent her away. Janey was feeling quite angry about that, and angry that she had let herself be sent away. Pilot snuggled closer, sensing his mistress's discomfort. \"Let's go back, shall we?\"She rubbed the dog behind his ears and kissed his snout. At least he would always love her. Slowly, she walked back to the hospital, this time more determined than ever to speak to Thomas. He was going to be a father... he needed to know that, at least. As she reached his room, though, she saw them through the glass. He had his arms around Edith. Her stomach turned as her fears were confirmed. Letting go of Pilot, she ran to the open courtyard, where she had to sit down because she had become dizzy. Tears streamed down her face. Her mother had been right all along. No one could love her... certainly not someone like Thomas. She had been a diversion, no more. Now she would go home, pack her things and be on her way. She couldn't face him, not even to say goodbye. Never had she felt weaker. Pilot dashed past her, and then she heard that familiar voice: \"There you are. I've been looking all over for you. If this old boy hadn't come and found me, I might not have found you at all. Have you been crying?\" \"Just go.\" She kept her eyes at Pilot as she spoke, who darted happily at Thomas's side. Traitor. \"What?\" he asked, confused. She wiped the tears off her face before answering. \"You've come to tell me you're leaving me. So, just go already. I'll be fine. I always am.\" \"What are you talking about, Janey?\" \"You have your sight back, so there is no reason you two can't be together. I saw you with your arms around her.\" \"Who?\" \"Edith.\" Was he really going to deny it? \"Janey... I was comforting her because she was crying. All that has happened... it brought up some unpleasant memories.\" \"I know I'm not right for you. And I am not pretty or sophisticated like she is. I'm just Janey. Even my name is common.\" Why wouldn't he just let her go. \"Janey, you are anything but common. Stop putting yourself down. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. And this time I can say that with the fullest of confidence. You have a rare and unique beauty… you a fiery gem that a man finds only once in a lifetime. You are more beautiful than any woman I've ever met... I love you with all my heart. In fact, Edith and I were talking about you, and about how lovely you are.\" He pulled her close and kissed her. Janey struggled... she couldn't believe it. \"I love you and only you,\" he whispered softly. \"Why?\" was all she could utter. \"Why?\" he repeated. \"Janey, you are beautiful. Inside and out. I wish you would see what I see. I know people have put you down in the past, but let me tell you: no one comes even close to you. You are not only strong but kind. I can't imagine my life without you.\" \"Me neither,\" she muttered into his shoulder. Why had she doubted him? \"So, I don't have to go? Because I really don't want to. I want to stay with you for the rest of my life. You know, Edith asked me why I hadn't married you yet...\" \"Did you tell her why?\" \"Yes – I told her you did not want to be bound to a man, and that I was fine with that, as long as you are by my side.\" He kissed her hand. \"I may have changed my mind...\" Janey muttered. \"In what way?\" There was insecurity in Thomas voice. \"I... I wouldn't mind marrying you. If you still want me, that is.\" \"Really?\" he said excitedly. \"You know, you could make me no happier man than in agreeing to become my wife!\" \"There is more... I think I'm pregnant.\" \"Oh...\" Thomas looked shocked. Scared. She bit her lip. \"See. I know you wouldn't be happy.\" \"That's not it. I am happy, but also... Did Edith also tell you about my son?\" She thought back but couldn't remember. \"What son?\" \"Lucille... became pregnant... by me. The baby wasn't born right, though. It died a few days after it was born... There is so much wrong in my family. What if I'm …\" He couldn't even continue, and he couldn't look at her. \"Oh. No, I didn't know that.\" No wonder he was scared. Would her baby be alright? \"Sorry. I know it's one thing knowing Lucille and I were intimate... but quite another knowing that we had a child. When it died, I realised for the first time how wrong it was what we were doing. It was God punishing us once more. But I couldn't leave Lucille... her whole life, she had been in so much pain. She told me that the only thing that made her happy was me. So, how could I walk away? Anyway, I know it's a lot to take in... You have forgiven me so much. I shouldn't be telling you this. I understand if this is too much for you to forgive.\" He looked so desperate, much like the first time she had seen him. \"I love you Thomas. Whatever happened in the past is in the past. I would be lying if the things you and your sister did... did not... did not...\" It was more the idea of him having been with another woman that brought out a jealous side she had not been aware of... But, with four wives, of course he had been. She didn't like to think about it, though. \"Repulse you... You can say it... Looking back at them, they repulse me too. We were so young though, when we first sought comfort with each other. It didn't feel wrong at the time... Sorry, you don't want to hear all this.\" He wanted to walk away, but she stopped him \"It's alright, Thomas. I love you, no matter what your past is. I know there are demons there, but there are demons in mine as well. You've got to leave all that guilt behind, though. You are a wonderful, caring man.\" After all, he cared for her. \"I have. But I don't want to return to the man I was back then.\" \"I don't think you ever will.\" He nodded, looking pensively. \"I want you to see a doctor for our baby. Get the best medical treatment. Maybe we should rent a house in town, close to a hospital...\" Men looking at her every day... the mere notion gave her chills. \"Thomas, I'll be fine... I don't want to move. I love our home.\" That was what it was. Not a roof over her head, not a house, but the home she had never had, \"I don't want you to get hurt... Or the baby. If you lose it...\" He looked desperate. \"We will deal with it. Together. I honestly don't think it will come to that. But I can't stand the idea of being prodded for nine months. Have some faith everything will be alright.\" She would do the worrying for him. \"One more thing... I would be honoured to be your husband, but you don't have to marry me if you don't want to. If you are just doing it for the baby... we will find another way. I want you to be happy. It's not like we are ever going to be a conventional couple.\" He really loved her and would do anything to make her happy. Janey realised what a fool she had been today. After all, this was Thomas and, sight or no sight, he was still the same man. She smiled as she spoke, though there were tears in her eyes. This time they were happy tears, though. \"I want to marry you, though. If you'll still have me.\" \"For now and forever. But are you sure you want me, with all my scars?\" he said, giving her a last option to refuse. She stroked his cheek, tracing the white line below the eye that would never see again. That was alright, though; now, the other was functioning again. \"It's only a minor one. Want to see mine?\" \"Later. Let's go home. There, I want to kiss every one of them until the hurt goes away.\" The lines on her back ran much deeper than the scar they had left behind, though. \"That might take a lifetime.\" \"Well, that is what I plan on spending with you.\" He got down on his knee. \"I don't have a ring, but please would you marry me, Janey Peregrine?\" \"Yes. Yes, I would.\" Princess PrettyPants: Just a one more chapter, and it will be finished Belco: Thank you Guest: Sorry someone spoiled the movie for you. To be fair, I hadn't seen it yet when I started writing. Had read the book though. Happy you like it.[Chapter 39] It was in the middle of the night as Thomas woke up, Janey firmly wrapped up in his arms. He kissed the top of her head. They were home again, and no one could ever separate them now. \"She is beautiful,\" a voice whispered beside them. Thomas looked up, and there was Lucille, hovering over Janey. For a moment, he was worried his sister would harm her. After all, Lucille's jealously had been boundless when she had been alive. \"Don't worry. I'm not staying. Your lovely bride is safe. I like her. She takes good care of you, in ways I never could,\" she smiled, as he realised he could see her as well as hear her. \"You can stay, if you like,\" he offered. She deserved to be in a place where she was happy. \"No. I don't belong here. Not yet anyway... You were right. It was time to leave.\" \"Are you happy where you now, Lucy?\" \"Yes. Almost... I'm at peace. I see where I went wrong, and I'm so sorry. I hurt you. I hope one day you can forgive me for that.\" She sounded genuinely regretful. \"I have always forgiven you. I hurt you as well. If I had been stronger...\" \"But you weren't. You were weak, because I made sure of it. I was afraid you would leave me otherwise. And you did... Once you found your strength, you were ready to leave with Edith, and you were right.\" \"I wasn't leaving... I was going to give Edith the papers for her inheritance back and I was going to stay with you. You needed me. She never did. Edith never needed anyone. Unlike us.\" It was hard to think about. \"Oh Tommy... That would have been wrong though. I would have only made you miserable.\" \"You've changed a lot,\" he noted. The old Lucille would have never been able to see, let alone admit, the error of her ways. \"Yes... Much too late, though. I was a monster, blinded by hatred and jealousy... But no more. Marry that woman in your arms, Tommy. She is going to make you happy,\" Lucille said, confirming what he already knew. \"She already does. Whether we are married or not.\" \"But you are marrying her now. Tomorrow. And you are going to have a beautiful son... He will live, Tommy. A gentle and smart boy like his father. And there will be others,\" she promised. \"Can I love him?\" Like Janey, he worried about that most. He was terrified that somehow he would turn into his father. \"Of course you can. And so can she. You will have so much love. Everything we missed.\" Tears sprang to his eyes. \"I wish you could stay. You deserve happiness too.\" \"Don't worry. I'll be back soon. And, in the meantime, you will be much too busy to miss me.\" \"I don't understand...\" \"You will, in time. Give her the ring. It will look beautiful on her.\" She took the ring from her finger. As she placed it in his hand, it lost its eerie appearance and he could feel the cold metal press into his palm \"Your ring? Mom's ring? Are you sure it isn't cursed?\" he asked. \"Not now they are gone. I would like her to have it. I know you don't want anything that is connected to your old life any more, but... Please, think about it. I would like her to have it. With my blessing.\" There was a serenity about her that he had never seen during her life. \"You have found peace.\" \"I have.\" She kissed his cheek, it felt like a whisper of air, before disappearing. \"Goodbye Thomas.\" He woke up startled, waking up Janey as well. Had it just been a dream? Coming to terms with his past, he had missed his sister in these past few weeks more than ever. She had been a victim of circumstance, even more than he had been. He wished he could have made it right somehow, even though he knew that was impossible. \"You're crying,\" Janey stated as she hugged him tight. He had not even noticed the tears on his cheek until she mentioned them. \"It was just a dream.\" Janey rubbed his tears away, softly smiling at him.\"A bad one?\" \"Not quite. Just... Something that can't be.\" It was a great comfort to have Janey in his arms, though. \"Was it about your sister?\" she asked as if she knew. Had he talked in his sleep? \"Yes... Why do you ask?\" \"I think she came to visit me a few nights back. Was a very strange dream. She gave me her blessing. She was kind and warm, not like... I imagined her.\" \"She has found peace. Why didn't you mention it?\" \"I thought it would upset you. And well... you might think that I was crazy.\" \"I would never think that. You're no more crazy then I am.\" \"Well, that is reassuring,\"Janey laughed. As he wrapped his arms around her, he heard something small tumble to the floor. Looking down, he saw it – a red teardrop. The ring. He had not seen it since the day his sister had died, and he was sure Edith had not brought it. So, she had been here. And she had given her blessing. Getting out of bed, he snatched the ring off the floor. Then he looked at Janey. She looked so beautiful... she had no idea. He loved her more than he had ever loved anyone. Even Edith. Even Lucille... but somehow he knew his sister was all right with that now. And now, new life was growing in this beautiful woman. Life that they had made. It scared him. It humbled him. But it also made him immensely happy. He could not imagine his life without her. A white dress, which he hadn't seen yet, lay in the other room. Her room, though she hadn't slept in it since they had come back. This was now their room and, even on the night before their wedding, she had insisted on being with him there. \"It's getting light,\" he said, looking at the window. Janey yawned. \"But it's still early. Come back to bed.\" She stretched her arms out to him, and he could do nothing but comply. Quickly, he pocketed the ring as he tried to decide what to do with it. It belonged to Lady Sharpe and, by this time tomorrow, that would be Janey. But there was so much blood sticking to the ring. Still, Lucille wanted her to have it and that meant a lot. He would need to think about it. Holding Janey in his arms, he went back to sleep. As he stood before the mirror, getting dressed for church, he couldn't believe that Alan was going to be the best man at his wedding... and that his ex-wife would be the maid of honour. Edith was currently helping Janey to get ready in the other room. The dress had been kept a secret, which had been a lot harder since he had his sight back. He had actually been asked to close his eyes as the dress had been carried upstairs when Edith and Alan had arrived the day before. Finishing his tie, he checked himself in the mirror. The scar was there but it was far less visible than he had imagined all those years when he was blind. It wasn't red, just a faint white line under his eye. Yes, his eyes were different colours now, due to the damage to the pupil artery, but even though it looked strange, it wasn't scary, which was a relief. He didn't want to be that monster any longer. Janey deserved a good man, and so did their future child. A boy, Lucille had said. One that would live. He took her ring from his pocket, wondering what to do with it. And then he noticed the gemstone. No longer was it red. The ruby had been drained of its colour and nowit was almost clear, with a white hue, as if a spirit lingered inside. It was beautiful. He checked again...This really was the same ring, there was no doubt about it. Was this a sign that the curse truly had been lifted? Was happiness within their grasp? \"Thomas, it's time to leave,\"Alan called. \"We want to get there before the ladies do.\" The church was not as empty as Thomas had thought it would be. Well, he had never expected to marry again, frankly but, even when Janey had finally agreed, he had never expected there to be more people there than the two of them and the dog. Sweet Pilot still hadn't come to terms with the fact that his master could see now, and still stayed close to him, leading him where ever he needed to go. But Pilot was far from the only familiar face that was there. Unwittingly, Janey and Thomas seemed to have made several friends in the village. Mostly, they were the suppliers that faithfully brought them the goods they needed, week in week out. Catherine's husband was also there, and Catherine would be there later, as she was actually the one bringing Janey to the church on her horse and cart. This would not be a glamorous wedding, but neither had his others been. This one, however, was filled with love by all who attended it. There were no hard feelings left between him and Alan. Both he and Edith seemed to have taken Thomas' advice to heart, and they were now together. Well, they had been for the past five years, but finally the distance between them had been bridged. He had caught them kissing in the garden after they had been for dinner last night and, truth to be told, he couldn't feel happier. All those thoughts left his mind, though, the minute Janey stepped into the church. She looked a vision, floating on a white cloud. She looked as beautiful as... the ring and, with that, his decision had been made. As he promised to be hers forever, he gently slid it on her finger. There was a look of surprise on her face. \"Moonstone? That's my favourite. How did you know?\" she whispered. \"I didn't.\" But someone watching over them obviously had. And she was smiling down at them. Thomas and Janey could not help loving each other. So, two years later, they had another baby, a girl. In fact, they had several more children after that, but Lucy... well, she lived up to her aunt's name. They had thought long and hard about naming her but, in the end, it seemed no more than right than to honour his sister in this way. And even though she had her mother's red locks, he could not help seeing his sister in this little girl, whose stubborn nature could test his patience like none of his other children could. But that was alright because, in the end, she knew she was loved and, whatever she did, her parents were always there for her, to love and protect her. So this is it... The end, and I hope a better one than in the book. I get why Del Toro made him die, as he finally saw the truth about his life, the last of his innocence died and with that he did as well. His life was a lie. He was Lucille's reason to justify her actions, and with that justification no longer valid, he was marked for death. So I understand why. I thought however the choice was too easy. For Thomas to live with his wrongdoings, knowing his sister had died would have been far harder on everyone. And he deserved a chance to redeem, not just in words, but in actions. So a \"what if\" scenario popped in my head. I started writing, and 39 chapters along the line, this is the end result. I hope you liked it. I hope you will let me know that you liked it, even if you read this two years from now. I really like reviews, you see...lol. Thank you for reading this, and I hope to surprise you with another story soon. Because I will always keep writing.
