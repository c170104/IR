[{"Movie":"Hedwig and the Angry inch","Title":"Departures and Arrivals","Author":"MewWolf5","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10544696","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"…Goodbye, wicked…little town…\" Tommy Gnosis sang the notes of a melancholy tune, a tune he no longer claimed as his own. As the sound of his guitar faded out, he could hear the cheers at Hedwig's concert. Their roles had been reversed. The large venues where he once played were now where she played, him being left to the smaller ones as his popularity dwindled, the public turning on him for stealing the songs that the two of them had written together. Maybe it was wrong for him not to give her credit, but they were his songs as well as hers. Tommy looked at the small audience. They didn't even fill half the seats. \"I don't know why you guys still like me,\" he said into the microphone. \"But for whatever reason it is, I hope you do realize that everything Hedwig has said is true. I'm the one who lied. I hope you're here because you can forgive me for my mistakes. It's more than I can do.\" Tommy turned to his drummer, telling him which song they'd play next. The drummer was his only band member who hadn't left him. \"Now I'm going to perform a song I'm sure you already know, but I'm going to sing it the way it was meant to be sung…before I…ruined it…The way she'd want you to hear it.\" He nodded to the drummer before playing the opening notes on his guitar; the same guitar Hedwig had decorated for him. With only his voice, his guitar and the drums, the sound of the song was shallow, but Tommy still poured his emotions into each note; all the pain he knew he had caused for Hedwig and himself. He had to correct his mistakes, if it was possible. \"And Osiris and the gods of the Nile gathered up a big storm...\" He sang and sang, exhausted by the time he reached the end of the song. At the end of the concert, he bid his remaining fans goodbye before heading backstage to pack up. He was heading back to his hometown of Junction City. While he may not have had the best home life, he thought it might be the best place to start over. He needed to start somewhere familiar. \"That's the last of it,\" Yitzhak said as he closed his suitcase. He paused as he looked at Hedwig, who was standing on the other side of it. \"I'm sorry it didn't work out.\" \"I know,\" Hedwig said after a moment, before picking up one of the bags to take it to the car. At the end of the band's short recent tour they had come back to Junction City to prepare Yitzhak for his trip to Polynesia. Hedwig had decided to let him go. She had realized how much he had gone through for her. The least she could do was let him have his dream. He loved \"Rent.\" Together, they walked through the airport to Departures. When they got to the security line, they knew it was time to part ways. Yitzhak faced Hedwig and placed a hand on her shoulder. They stood in silence, not needing words. They knew it was goodbye, but not whether it was goodbye forever. \"Maybe you can write sometime,\" Hedwig murmured. Yitzhak nodded before taking his bags and moving through the line. With a sigh, Hedwig turned to slowly walk back through the airport. She wasn't sure what made her look up as she neared Arrivals. Perhaps she still recognized his gait and maybe it was because she still waited and looked for him. Whatever it was, she looked over to see Tommy. With his guitar case in one hand and the other pulling his suitcase, he seemed almost lost in the crowd. A few months ago, he would have never walked by unnoticed. As was reflected by the amount of belongings he now carried, he no longer had much. His days of popularity were over. It seemed fitting for them to meet in Junction City where it all began. Just like it had started, Hedwig noticed him and then he noticed her. Moments after she had looked at him, Tommy caught her gaze and they looked at each other, neither of them moving before Tommy timidly approached her. Much like the last time they had seen each other, they were both at a loss for words. Hedwig looked into the blue pools that were Tommy's eyes, reminded of what had captured her attention all that time ago. \"I'm sorry,\" Tommy said, finally breaking the silence. \"I was foolish and I did things without understanding what I was doing. I took so much from you.\" This was true. They both knew it. \"Y-you look good…\" Tommy said. Big rock and roll fame and he still had an awkwardness about him. He may have grown up, but he still wasn't completely through with being a boy. The corners of Hedwig's mouth turned up slightly, reminded of the strange charm that she had seen in Tommy. \"Can't say the same about yourself,\" Hedwig joked, patting Tommy on the shoulder. Playfully, Tommy hit her back, starting to smile with that boyish grin of his. They laughed together for a moment before quieting down again. \"So what is rock icon Tommy Gnosis doing here, by himself, in Junction City?\" \"Haven't you heard?\" Tommy replied with a melancholy tone and shrugging. \"I'm all washed up.\" They went quiet again. \"I brought it on myself,\" Tommy murmured. \"I deserve it.\" He looked down at the floor. \"Well, maybe you do,\" Hedwig said. It hurt Tommy to hear it straight from her, but he knew she was right. \"But part of me never let go of you, so the least I can do is give you one small favour. You've gotten skinny. How about I take you home for some dinner? What do you say?\" Tommy looked at Hedwig. He was surprised, but grateful. They left the Arrivals area of the airport and went back to Hedwig's place. They both knew they wouldn't be able to go back to the way things were before, but they were willing to go from there in some new direction. \"What were you doing in the airport?\" Tommy asked once they had sat down. \"I thought you would rather be performing somewhere more interesting than this town.\" \"Well,\" Hedwig began. \"I was sending my backup singer off. He got another job and I was saying my goodbyes.\" \"How are you going to perform without him?\" Tommy asked, surprised at the risk Hedwig was taking. \"I'll start looking for a replacement. I'll need one soon, since I'll be starting another tour.\" Tommy thought about playing with Hedwig again, joining the band as a backup singer. But he knew it wouldn't work, not after what had happened between them. They couldn't act like it had never happened. When he finished eating, Tommy looked up again. \"Say…\" he said hesitantly. \"Before I go, maybe we could jam some?\" Hedwig looked at him. Leaving the dinner dishes on the table, she got up and led him into another room. Tommy took his guitar out of the case, the gold paint still shining like the day Hedwig had given him his now infamous name. He ran his fingers over the jagged letters. Who was Tommy Gnosis, really? He thought that when it came down to it, Tommy Gnosis was just a coward. Tommy slipped his guitar strap over his shoulder and started played \"Tear Me Down.\" He let Hedwig begin before joining in at the chorus. \"Enemies and adversaries…they try and tear me down…\" They sang on and on, their voices getting more intense as they continued. By the time they had stopped, Tommy knew it was too late to impose onto his family, so Hedwig let him stay the night, though it seemed strange. Tommy left the next morning, but on good terms this time. \"We should do this again,\" Tommy said as he carried his things to the door. \"I never forgot you, Hedwig,\" he added, facing her one last time. \"And I never forgot you,\" Hedwig replied. Tommy smiled and turned to leave. Albeit with a bit more frequency than either of them expected, Tommy did come around now and then, and the two of them would play. Tommy fell into obscurity, playing for small bands, always credited as Tommy Speck. But one day, he and Hedwig played a one-night concert; \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch – with special guest Tommy Gnosis.\" The crowd cheered as the two of them sang. They were very happy.

He didn't care about what they had to say. There was something deeper going on inside of him Her name was Hedwig. Hedwig. As if God was doing this to mock him, to punish him for what he did so long ago. Abandoning his family, leaving them to fend for themselves. And in East Germany, of all places. He didn't even know if they were still alive, if they were doing alright, if - The band was packing up, and everyone in the diner was resuming business as usual. Hans stood up, walked right up to the lead singer, to Hedwig. He had to ask. He had to. Because he could tell from her accent that she was German, and perhaps there was the slightest chance that maybe she knew them, maybe she knew if his family was alive or not. Maybe she could tell him that everything was okay, that they were fine. He coughed. \"Um, Miss -\" \"Just Hedwig is fine,\" she flashed a quick smile at him before resuming packing up her microphone. Hans rubbed his palms together. \"I was just curious, where are you from? You sound German.\" Oh God did he really just say that. She was still. \"I am German,\" she said slowly. \"I grew up in East Berlin. Why?\" \"Well you see, my wife was named Hedwig just like you, and my son was named Hansel, and I was just wondering if you knew them -\" She dropped the mic. \"OH\" \"Well?\" \"I...\" she looked down at the floor. \"Of course I knew them. I knew them better than anyone else in the town.\" \"So how are they?\" \"How come you left?\" He blinked. \"Pardon?\" \"Why did you leave your family? Why did you leave your wife to teach sculpting class to armless children? Why did you leave your son to sing along to rock songs in the oven? Why?\" It was his turn to be still. \"I... I never... I had to leave Berlin. I couldn't stay.\" \"So you left your family ? Do you have any idea what they've been through? No, of course you don't.\" She threw the mic to Yitzhak and stormed out. Yitzhak shook his head at Hans. Hans went back to his seat, ignored by the diner, internationally ignored by everyone because nobody cared to listen. He put his head in his hands and rested all his weight on the table. He didn't notice five minutes pass, ten minutes pass, half an hour, closing time come, a person slip into the seat in front of him. It was Hedwig. \"Hansel doesn't exist,\" she told him. He popped his head up to look at her. \"W-what do you mean? He's my son!\" \"Hansel died the day he married Luther. Hansel died the day Luther left.

But happy New Year you guys! Tommy Gnosis sat in his booth alone. It was a rather crowded dinner, but it was better than half of the other ones in New York. On New Year's Eve. Where Hedwig was playing time square. Sighing, he picked up his coffee mug and took a sip. He was lucky that no one recognized him any more. Once the word got out he stole her songs, he was trashed by the media. Hell, he was trashed anywhere. Even at his own home. Of course, that was a different type of trashed... This was, what, the first time he'd been fully sober in a year? Two? He didn't know. The only thing he knew was after his last concert, he started drinking, and never stopped. But Hedwig was playing Times Square this year. Who knows what she was going to play. Her normal set? Auld Lane Syne? One of his songs, on his album that failed, that she's only played once? He smiled, remembering the good old days. He fingered a couple of notes on the table, from Long Grift . He hummed a few notes, but stopped, in fear he would cry. He couldn't cry. His reputation had been trashed enough. Hedwig trashed him, giving out horrible stories about why they left each other. Tommy was a confused, teenage boy. Why was he attracted to a woman with no breasts, with a deep voice, and hairy legs and underarms? An adam's apple, a male jaw line! He loved her. He really did. He was just shocked. Anyone else would be too! But everyone took her side in the argument. No one even listened to him, that he sill loved her, that she shoved him out, that she over reacted, that he lost his origin of love. Just because of a stupid hesitation. He was scared. He was. If she had just told him it was okay, he would have stayed. Asked questions. Instead, the woman who gave him a hand-job while his baby brother was laying on the floor... She was out of his grip. Vanished. His head spun as the dinner started counting down from ten. He pulled the flask out of his jacket pocket. \"Here's to you, Hedwig.\" The crowd cheered as he took a big swig. He watched the small television monitor, as the ball dropped, and Hedwig sang Wicked Little Town . Tommy's version. His mascara ran down his face as he made his coffee Irish.

I think Yitzhak is gorgeous in every way but especially in the newly on BROADWAY play with Lena Hall! You can envision Yitzhak here in either version but I feel we can see some more love from Yitzhak in the movie so I'm putting this under the movie category. Seriously, I'm in love. I really hope you like it and if you've read it please review so I know because I'm guessing there aren't many people who look for this category just because of the low fic rate. Thank you! Yitzhak was in their shoddy motel room, brushing all of Hedwig's flamboyant wigs. By now he felt no more sorrow for the microphone incident. Well, not really incident. She just felt threatened I was robbing her spotlight. Stupid. The room already felt gloomy, barely any room for them all to sleep in. Her absurd amount of wigs only added to the cramped feeling. Still, she did look very striking and, as usual, Yitzhak could not look away. At times he was unsure if he wanted to be her or be with her. He stared at the beautiful shine of the blonde hair in his hand. He could try it, he could be just as picturesque as Hedwig and maybe then, she would… I could just – \"Hello!\" – Too late. Yitzhak tore off that wig quickly and shielded his sheepish face. He sighed; Hedwig, as usual, always strutting over into the spotlight. If she had seen that wig on him… Yitzhak tossed the idea, feeling a chill run through him. Noticing the lack of usually drunken, cheery responses, Hedwig's own tone lowered – her entrance ruined, \"where is everybody?\" \"Out,\" Yitzhak responded curtly. He went about brushing that hair, avoiding eye contact with its owner. \"Why are you in such a mood?\" Yitzhak ignored her question although it went unnoticed as Hedwig followed immediately. \"I was having the most wonderful time with – do you remember that um, that forty five year old divorcee with the hair and the-and the-the mean look?\" Yitzhak finally turned to face her; she was drunk or had drunk at least. Being the good husband he was, he sat and listened to her. She didn't pay heed to his lack of answer and went on, \"Well, she came up to me after the show and I thought: this lady wants a piece of me. So, I didn't know-you know- I was alone, I had nothing in my hand, I was gonna go for the eyes and she came at me from both sides somehow and she just gave me a fucking hug . She gave me a fucking hug.\" Yitzhak could deal with this; little chats, just the two of them. He was grateful for moments when she spoke to him kindly. Hedwig, too, was tired after a long day, she couldn't even laugh properly and it just came out as a little huff of breath from her nose. Yitzhak searched her face, she'd been so clumsy with her drink and she'd gotten a bit of her lipstick smudged. \"Fucking beat that, I also got a few drinks out of it as well which was not…\" Yitzhak gently grabbed her chin and had her face him. He'd fix it up for her. \"Bad.\" She was so beautiful. It wasn't just her makeup or her wigs, it was her. She was already beautiful like a woman, her features were soft and without all the makeup she had this almost innocent like face – If she were still a man she would be a perfect drag queen that Yitzhak would cherish – with it, she was just like those temptresses Yitzhak's mother would warn him about. He dabbed along her upper lip, carefully removing the ruby-red cosmetic she loved so much. He let the napkin fall, raising his other hand to brush her soft skin. Her blue eyes met his, it was barely a caress, he was careful not to over step her boundaries. When no push of disgust came, it encouraged him to keep on. His gaze drifted to her faded lips. He drew in closer and closer, relieved to see her mimicking him. When their lips touched, Yitzhak felt like an easiness slip through him. Their breath mingled, he didn't pull too far back. The smile that stretched his lips was smothered when they dove in for more. He was more confident, cupping her jaw and caressing her face while their mouths molded together. She certainly seemed to like it which was unreal to believe. She wasn't abusive or cold. She was the source of the warmth sprouting in the pit of Yitzhak's stomach. It was going so well until the familiar beat of drums played from the television. Fuck, she's watching fucking Tony Gnosis sing our- well… her song. Yitzhak tried to turn her head, she could forget about that little shit if she was with him. But no, she was always so invested in that brat. She pushed him away and Yitzhak felt a gush of fury run through him. He pushed back, throwing her hand off of him. He knocked over something he didn't care to look at. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\" \"Why can't we-!\" Yitzhak spun around, prepared to actually unleash his feelings on her. She doesn't care. \"Why don't you write a new song!?\" He kicked one of her Styrofoam heads and rushed out, slamming the door preventing her from ever answering. She didn't go after him but he didn't go too far. He just kicked the cheap wall of that hallway, unsympathetic to whoever was staying in the room behind that poor wall. Stupid Hedwig… stupid Yitzhak, she wants to keep following him. He slid down the door, looking down at his left hand with regret. The gold band had lost all its shine, just like their relationship. So fucking tired… He didn't know how long he sat out there, fuming out his emotions until he heard the click of the door and fell back when it was swung open. Hedwig got out of the way before Yitzhak would fall on her heels. He grunted as his head hit the dirty, carpeted floors. He stared up at her in wonder, she on him with that fierce expression that he was never good at reading. Her golden, synthetic hair framed and tumbled around her. She looks like an- \"Get the fuck inside, Yitzhak.\" - angel.

Hedwig put down her makeup brush and answered. \"Hello?\" she said into the receiver. \"Hansel?\" The voice that answered back was a voice that Hedwig hadn't heard in such a long time that she could hardly fathom what was happening. Hedwig never thought she'd see her mother or hear that voice again. \"Mother?\" Hedwig said incredulously into the phone, at a loss for words. \"Yes, my son,\" the voice said back. Hedwig could hear her choking up on the other end of the line. \"How did you get my number?\" Hedwig asked. \"I came to America after news of you made it to Europe…is it true you had an affair with that boy rocker?\" Hedwig didn't know how to respond to that but her mother didn't give her the chance. \"Never mind, we can go over everything later. Where can I meet you?\" After confirming that Mrs. Schmidt was in the right city, Hedwig gave the name and address of a local restaurant. \"I'll meet you outside,\" Hedwig said before they hung up. After setting the telephone down, Hedwig took a deep breath and held her face in her hands. Nothing could have prepared her for this. She had no idea what her mother would say. Would she even recognize her? Surely she had changed into someone different than the son her mother once knew. She had the rest of the day to anticipate the meeting. The band members noticed her preoccupation during their practice that afternoon. \"Miss Hedwig,\" Skszp tried to interject during their run through a set. She didn't respond. \"Miss Hedwig,\" he repeated. \"What, Skszp?\" Hedwig finally said. \"Your mic isn't on,\" he said. \"And you're singing the song too slowly.\" \"Oh,\" Hedwig replied, still in a daze. \"Just keep going.\" With a shrug, Skszp gestured to the band to keep playing. Hedwig corrected her mistake, but kept becoming out of synch with the band as her mind wandered. Finally, it was time for her to get ready to go meet her mother. She took off her wig and sat down in front of the mirror to fix her makeup. She wiped off her glittery lipstick and replaced it with a more neutral tone. She drew her eyebrows in so that they were in less harsh of a line than she had worn then earlier. She then chose one of her more modest wigs that didn't have any outrageous curls. Throwing on a light jacket, she was ready to go. Or at least, as ready as she'd ever be. She went out the door and tried to control her breathing. She felt another pang of anxiety as the restaurant neared on the horizon. As she got closer, she could see the figure of an old woman standing in front. As Hedwig started coming up the walk, she saw it was indeed her mother. It took Mrs. Schmidt a few moments to realize who the person standing in front of her was, but when she did her face brightened like the sun shining through the clouds after a rain storm. The lines that had been etched into her face with age became deeper as she smiled, recognizing her child. \"Mother…\" was all Hedwig was able to say before her mother had wrapped her arms around Hedwig's middle. \"My son…\" she said as she hugged her tighter. As they stood there in their embrace, Hedwig forgot the bitterness that she had held for her mother for so many years and was overcome with happiness. After a minute, Mrs. Schmidt looked up into Hedwig's face with tears in her eyes. \"I never thought I'd see you again,\" she said. She tenderly reached a hand up to Hedwig's face, gently caressing her cheeks, then feeling the wig. She stood there for a few more moments, examining Hedwig's features before they went inside the restaurant. This joint was less tacky than Bildgewaters and was much more respectful of Hedwig and her crew. The server welcomed the two of them with a smile before they were seated. \"So,\" Mrs. Schmidt asked as she perused the menu, \"how's Luther?\" Hedwig took a moment before answering, not wanting to think about it but knowing that this topic of conversation was inevitable. \"He left me years ago,\" Hedwig finally said. Mrs. Schmidt studied Hedwig's face for a moment before asking, \"Is that where that rocker boy comes in?\" Hedwig sighed before telling her mother the whole story; building herself back up after Luther had abandoned her in the trailer park, meeting Tommy, how she thought it would last forever until Tommy left her too, all the way until where they were now. \"And part of me was always mad at you,\" Hedwig continued. \"You and Luther, for dragging me into it, for bringing such mutilation upon me.\" A single tear rolled down Hedwig's cheek from her clouded eyes. She tried to get a hold of herself, but it was futile. \"I'm sorry, Hansel,\" Mrs. Schmidt said. \"I could never have anticipated the pain you would have gone through, and at the time you and Luther were so very happy.\" She reached across the table to hold Hedwig's hand, which was clenched tightly. \"You took a piece of me,\" Hedwig said, her voice still sounding choked. \"You and Luther…and Tommy. Everyone I've ever loved, they all took a piece of me; they all tore me apart!\" \"Shh…it's all behind you now, Hansel –\" \"Hansel's gone!\" Hedwig snapped, cutting Mrs. Schmidt off. \"Hansel was gone after the operation, after I crossed the ocean to come to America, after Luther left!\" \"Hedwig, then; it's all behind you,\" Mrs. Schmidt tried to continue. \"You can move forward –\" \"No, I can't!\" Hedwig shouted, interrupting her mother a second time. \"Not with the constant reminder every day when I turn on the radio, when I turn on the television, when I take off my clothes! Every day I'm reminded of what's been taken from me!\" \"Hansel, you have to keep moving forward, they don't control you –\" \"I told you, Hansel's gone!\" Hedwig cried before getting up to leave. With surprising quickness for her age, Mrs. Schmidt grabbed Hedwig's hand before she could go any further. \"Hedwig!\" she shouted. Hedwig stopped. Neither of them moved or said anything for a few moments before Mrs. Schmidt spoke again, this time in a lower tone. \"I came all this way to see you,\" she said quietly. \"Please don't go.\" Hedwig slowly turned and sat back down. They both had tears in their eyes. Hedwig used her napkin to wipe her eyes, knowing it would smudge what makeup she had put on. \"Maybe you have changed since I last saw you,\" Mrs. Schmidt said, \"but I'm still your mother and you're still my child. I only acted the way I did back then because I wanted you to be happy. I wanted a better life for you. Under the circumstances, I believed in what we needed to do at the time. You may have been hurt, but you are fee, creating a life for yourself that would not have been possible in Berlin.\" \"What if we had waited, Mother?\" Hedwig asked. \"What if we had waited? The wall would have come down and none of it would have been necessary.\" \"Perhaps,\" Mrs. Schmidt replied calmly, \"but recovery doesn't happen overnight. It still would not have been the same as the opportunity you have here.\" Hedwig thought for a moment. Her mother had stayed in Europe when the wall came down and afterwards; of all the people Hedwig knew, her mother would know the most about what things were like. Maybe her actions were motivated by a kind of love only a mother could express. They ordered their food and their conversation moved on to other topics. Mrs. Schmidt shared stories about her time in Yugoslavia. Hedwig talked about how she had met the people who now formed her band. When they had finished, they slowly made their way out and down the street to where Mrs. Schmidt was staying the night. They stopped outside the front entrance to the hotel. Mrs. Schmidt spread her arms wide and they wrapped their arms tightly around each other. \"My son…\" Mrs. Schmidt said quietly. \"Hansel… Hedwig ...I don't know when I'll ever see you again. I'm sorry I couldn't have stayed longer, but I leave tomorrow.\" \"You can come hear the band play if you have time,\" Hedwig said. \"It's the kind of music you'd make me play in the oven, but maybe you'll like it knowing that it's me singing it.\" It wasn't certain, but even if this was it, it was enough. Her mother may have taken a piece of her, but was only because she wanted what was best. Hedwig still felt broken, but she could forgive her. Just this once.

But, after a bedtime story like that, you couldn't think! You could barely think into your adulthood. You hadn't found your other half yet. Maybe he was on the other side... It was the sad story how we became lonely two leg creatures. And what were you? A child of the sun? Possibly. A child of the moon? That one wasn't psychically possible. Or of the earth? Maybe... That's the pain that cuts a straight line through the heart. And then, one day, you see them. And you came from the sun. You're destined. He's your Sugar Daddy. Hey Sugar Daddy, Hansel needs some sugar in his bowl. The timeless tale, The Origin of Love. Hansel and Luther, rolled up into one, children of the sun. But not all can find their Sugar Daddy... No, sometimes you just get The Long Grift. If you've got some sugar, bring it home. Mama doesn't like him. She didn't like you much at the moment either. Not after he produced a ring, an application for American citizenship, And a wig. But was the plan so crazy it just might work? Sweet home über alles, lord I'm coming home! No. You ended up with an Angry Inch. Six inches forward, five inches back. The train is coming, and you're still tied to the track. And then, you're left with a sideways grimace on an eyeless face. Stay undercover until the night turns to black... You get all you wanted, with a few... Misunderstandings. You're there, you're just alone. He left. You've got music, but you're in coffee shops. Not stadiums. You see the very reason you fell apart, falling apart itself. They tore it down. Feel on the verge of going mad, and then it's time to punch the clock. You tear the wig he gave you, before everything, off, you look at it, squinting. There it lies, feigning shock. Your personal hell. Your Hedwig. Okay, everybody! You put on some make up, Turn on the eight-track, Pull the wig down from the shelf. Suddenly, you're this punk rock-star, from stage and screen. Until you wake up, and turn back to yourself. Your short set is almost over at the coffee hut, and you thank the audience. All... Well, both of them. You see a friendly face, pretending not to know you. But, the band starts to play. The only song you've written. You smile at him. And they're so twisted up, they'll twist you up, I fear. You take him under your kind, but slightly dented, wing. Your musical lessons were the hard part. Six months of rock history, lyrics, grooming, and vocal training. Yes, like mother made you, you stuck his head in the oven, and made him sing. Look what you've done... You see the friendly face again. But not so friendly this time. His cool, seductive, serenade, was just a tool of his trade. Singing backup, with your husband who loves you, is nice. Out of the spotlight. Now you ought to know, that this fool can no longer be swayed. It seems like no matter how hard you try, you end up black and blue. When you rose from the doctor's slab, you lost a piece of your heart. You gave a piece to your mother, your man, And you gave a piece to the rockstar. He took the good stuff and ran. Inside, you're hollowed out. Outside, a paper shroud, and all the rest's illusion. The automatist's undoing, the whole world starts unscrewing, Time collapses, and space warps. You see decay and ruin, I tell you: No, no, no, no, you make such an exquisite corpse. You look in the mirror again. You've gone mad. You've become that not-so-friendly face. And you remember that day in the coffee hut, so many years ago. It seems the stranger's always you, alone in some new Wicked Little Town. You look around. It's what you've always wanted. The people, millions of people, here for you. You look back at the small band, always have been here for you. You look to the ground, and sing, letting yourself, and them go. So hold on to each other, you gotta hold on tonight...

Hansel chewed on one blissfully while he lay next to Luther and a slow rock and roll song played on the radio. As he watched their chests slowly rise and fall in unison, a thought that had crossed his mind years before returned. Have I never been mellow? Hansel was sure he had never before felt as happy as he did in that moment; the beautiful song, being close to someone he loved and who loved him, the taste of a sweet confection filling his mouth. Yes, he was mellow, and he felt that he had power. Maybe not just power over someone, but emotional power too. Maybe Luther had a bit of power over him as well, but that was because he had put his spell on Hansel, who was enjoying every moment of it. Luther lifted his hand and slowly ran it down Hansel's body, caressing the gentle curves from his shoulders to his chest to his hips. Hansel reached his hand over to Luther's, lacing their fingers together. He turned his head to look at Luther. They stared into each other's eyes as the song played on, the moment feeling like it would never end – immortal. The love in Luther's gaze seemed that way to Hansel, and he was sure that moments like these would never end. Luther loved him. The look in his eyes made the fact even more clear than the last month had. They stayed that way until the song ended, when Hansel slowly sat up and pulled his legs over to the edge of the bed. The next song on the radio was one of Hansel's favourite upbeat tunes. He quickly grabbed a gummy bear before standing up. He began to dance. Perhaps not as wildly as when he was a child, but there were still some elements that remained from back then. He tried his own rendition of his favourite rockers' moves, moving to the rhythm of the song. He swiveled his hips sensually to the music, bringing Luther's attention to a body that had attracted him from the day he met Hansel. Damn, Hansel. I can't believe you're not a girl. You're so fine. Hansel kept dancing without a care in the world, getting fully into the song and enjoying himself without holding back. He danced over to the package of gummy bears, popping another one in his mouth as he began humming along to the song on the radio. \"Oh, baby,\" said Luther, turning down the music. \"Something's crossed my mind.\" \"Yeah?\" Hansel replied, a little disappointed that his dancing could not continue. \"What is it?\" \"I was thinking,\" Luther said, \"you'd look so fine in a velvet dress, with heels, and an ermine stole.\" \"Oh, Luther darling,\" Hansel denied teasingly , shoving Luther with the gummy bear package that was still in his hand. \"Heaven knows I've never put on women's clothes.\" Luther raised his eyebrows. \"Except for once my mother's camisole...\" Hansel said bashfully, his eyes shifting before he looked back at Luther and laughed as he leaned towards him. They kept laughing with their faces close together before Luther pressed his lips against Hansel's. They stood there for several moments, suspended in their embrace. As their lips parted, Luther took Hansel's hands in his own. \"I have to go now,\" he said, before kissing Hansel's hands. Luther grabbed his things before going out the door. Hansel followed him out. \"See you tomorrow, Hansel,\" Luther said. \"Bye, honey,\" Hansel replied, leaning against the door frame as he watched Luther walk away. Hansel waited at the same time the next day, knowing that Luther would be back. His thoughts wandered back to what Luther had said the day before. Would he really look good in a dress? Like he'd said, he'd tried on his mother's clothes before when she wasn't home, but that was mostly out of curiosity. He may have been a bit of a girly boy, but did he really want to be a woman or dress like one all the time? And did that matter? His thoughts were interrupted by the familiar knock at the door. He got up to let Luther in. Under one arm, Luther carried a box and in his other hand he held something in a Styrofoam package. It smelled good. \"I brought you some more presents,\" Luther said as he smiled at Hansel and walked in the door. \"What's that?\" Hansel asked, gesturing to the strong-smelling package, forgetting about the other box. \"I brought you lunch from the McDonald's on the other side,\" Luther said, handing the object to Hansel. He opened it, and the smell wafted out even stronger. A round bun with a beef paddy inside topped with cheese, lettuce and tomato sat neatly inside. Hansel tentatively picked it up and took a bite. He'd smelled the scents blowing down from the restaurant for so long, and now he finally got to taste its food. It was another bold reminder of what he was missing in East Berlin. And that familiar feeling came to him again; power. He only smiled at Luther once, with a mouthful of burger, before he finished the rest of it. \"You like it?\" Luther asked while Hansel was still chewing his last bit. Hansel nodded and swallowed. Luther then handed him the box. Hansel sat down to open it. Inside was a black velvet dress. \"Luther, I...\" Hansel didn't know what he was supposed to say. \"You were serious when you said...\" \"Why don't you try it on?\" Luther said. A little embarrassed and unsure as he watched the words form on Luther's lips, Hansel walked into another room. He quietly slipped out of his clothes and put the dress on. The material caressed his body in a way he had never felt before. It felt odd to him, yet somehow it seemed like it might be alright. He hesitantly walked back out for Luther to see him. When he came back out, Luther didn't say anything. He just looked at Hansel, who kept tugging uncomfortably at the dress instead of walking normally. Hansel could feel where it was loose around his flat, male chest. He walked over to the kitchen and grabbed two tomatoes. With a laugh, he stuffed them into the bodice of the dress. The tomatoes did a reasonable job of filling the dress out, though he was careful not to have them slide out of place. Still feeling a little uncomfortable, he walked back over to Luther, turning around once. \"You look...so fine,\" Luther said, holding Hansel's hands. Hansel got closer until he was near enough to Luther's face to kiss him. Luther's words had perfectly described how Hansel felt about the kiss. So fine. But Hansel felt that there was still something that wasn't quite right. \"Is it that you think only a woman can truly love a man?\" he asked once Luther pulled back from him. Luther didn't say anything; he just kept looking into Hansel's eyes. \"If that's what you think, I'll be more woman than a man like you can stand.\" Luther smiled and let out a quiet laugh. In only a moment, Hansel began to laugh, too, as they stood with their heads pressed close together. \"This is velvet, right?\" Hansel said after they had parted from that moment. \"I've never felt a material this nice before.\" \"Only the best for you, baby,\" Luther replied. \"What are you going to bring me next time?\" Hansel asked. \"Whatever you want, honey,\" Luther said. \"Versace blue jeans?\" \"If you want.\" \"A hypoallergenic dog?\" \"Not so fast; you're still living in East Berlin.\" Hansel's smile vanished with that last statement. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"Of course I'm still living here.\" \"Well,\" Luther said. \"You want to get out, don't you? Don't you want to be free to buy whatever you want, outside of the communist East?\" \"The communists gave Mother a job,\" Hansel replied. \"This is my home, even if it is a bit limited.\" \"But you're dissatisfied, aren't you? Don't you want to see what's on the other side of that wall?\" Hansel hesitated for a moment. Luther wasn't wrong. He did want to get out, and felt that there was a lot left to be desired in East Berlin. But how would they be able to get out? Luther was American and could travel as he pleased, but Hansel − he was East German and had to register just to go on vacation. \"I've got a plan, Hansel,\" Luther said after Hansel failed to come up with a response to his question. \"It involves me getting you out. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\" \"But how, Luther?\" Hansel asked with a combination of eagerness and confusion. \"You'll see,\" he said. \"But right now I've got to go.\" Luther came back the next day, and this time Hansel was waiting for him in his new dress. He thought Luther would like to see him wearing the gift he gave him, and the more time Hansel spent wearing it the more he liked it. Maybe he wasn't a woman, but dressing in clothes that were meant for one could be nice. Sometimes it felt like a fantasy, and sometimes it felt liberating and powerful. Luther smiled when he came back to see Hansel. \"I knew that dress would be perfect on you,\" he said as he came in the door. Hansel got up and wrapped his arms around Luther in greeting. \"How long can you stay today?\" Hansel asked. \"I was wondering if I could stay for dinner tonight,\" Luther replied. \"I'll have to ask Mother when she gets home,\" Hansel said, trying not to sound like Luther would be imposing, but not wanting to make any promises, either. His mother wasn't always strict, but she did have control over the household. \"I can wait,\" Luther said, smiling at Hansel before bringing him back into his embrace. They stood that way for a few moments before slowly wandering over to the small sofa. Luther ran his arms up and down Hansel's body, rustling the velvet fabric. \"I love you...Hansel...\" he said when he took a breath before Hansel shoved his mouth back onto his own. They kept at it for a while longer, before stopping to catch their breath. After calming down, Hansel glanced at the clock on the wall. \"Mother will be home soon,\" he said, standing up and smoothing his dress. \"I'll go change out of this.\" He changed back into his usual clothes and put the dress back at the bottom of his drawer. That evening, when Hansel's mother came inside, Luther and Hansel were sitting at the table, playing a game of cards. It was something that would be much less suspicious to her than what they had been doing earlier. \"Mother,\" Hansel said, looking up from the game, \"can Luther stay for dinner tonight?\" She paused for a moment. \"I don't mean to impose, Mrs. Schmidt,\" Luther said. \"If it would be better for you, I'll go.\" \"No,\" she replied. \"I don't see why not. You've been so generous lately; I don't see why I can't return the favour in some small way.\" She may not have known about the dress – that was a secret between Hansel and Luther – but she was aware of the other gifts that Luther had brought. Near the end of their meal, Luther produced marriage papers, a ring, and a wig and asked Hansel to marry him. He explained his plan. They could get married and by doing so Luther could get Hansel out of East Berlin. Hansel could see his shining future reflected in the wedding ring. He was going to do it. He was going to get over the wall. He was going to see the free world. Luther loved him and was going to take him there. And it was going to be so fine .

It has a few homosexual themes- I guess. But if you have a problem with that, than why on earth would you be reading fanfiction about a transsexual? Also, this is actually my first relatively serious ff story, so excuse if it's not up to your tastes:D Enjoy! Tommy Speck sat in a café in New York. Speck, not Gnosis, not for a few hours at least, just Speck. It had been a week since he had re-united with Hedwig, had a near, near fatal crash into a car and finally said goodbye to her, he was still thinking about wether what he had done was good or bad. It was raining heavily outside, despite the fact it was late August, but Tommy sat it the café booth, sipping his coffee in his warm trench coat. He hoped to God that none of his fans would recognize him, or worse, a news reporter. Someone asking him about his past events with Hedwig was the last thing he needed right now. It was Tommy Gnosis who had made a complete fool of himself, who had the brief unification with his ex-lover, who CD sales had slumped, who had watched helplessly as she rose to fame, the fame that was rightly hers, as much Tommy had disagreed, he knew deep down that it was true. The \"rock icon\" was gone; it was now just Tommy Gnosis- the musically-naïve boy. It was Tommy Speck who offered refuge from the flashing camera lights, the screaming fans, the masses of fan mail, or more recently, hate mail. A young man walked through the doors of the café, soaking wet. Tommy watched as he walked up towards him. \"Do you mind if I sit here? Every other booth is full.\" Tommy knew this was a lie, it was relatively quiet in the small café, and he could see at least three booths empty. But nevertheless, he let the man sit across from him. Drops of water fell from the man's face and hair. His face was relatively androgynous, a slim, pale face, long brown hair, large hazel eyes with dark rings under them, arched eyebrows, big lips, long neck and long nose. There was an awkward silence between them for a few moments, as the men looked at each other, both intrigued with the man sitting across them. \"So- uh… What's your name?\" Quick! Make something up! Tommy thought. \"Uh- Steven\" \"James. Dozo yoroshiku\" \"Huh?\" \"It's Japanese for 'pleased to meet you'\" \"Oh, well, dozo yoroshiku to you too\" James and Tommy smiled at each other and shook hands. As their smiles slowly faded, James reached into his shoulder bag and pulled out an issue of Uncut magazine. On the front, Tommy could see his name in bold letters in the corner of the page, his stomach lurched. Underneath is name he read the words Song theft, car crash and slumped sales… What will become of Gnosis? Pg. 24 A waitress came towards the two men, holding a pen and a notepad. \"Can I get you two anything?\" She asked, batting her eyelashes towards James' direction, who was immersed in his magazine \"Strong black, please. And a few chocolate biscuits.\" \"I'll have the same.\" Said Tommy. The waitress looked at Tommy strangely. \"You know, you look a lot like that To- Oh never mind, forget it.\" The waitress took Tommy's empty cup off the table and left both of them alone. Tommy breathed a sigh of relief. Way too close! James looked up from his magazine. \"Heard what happened to that Gnosis fellow?\" Fuck! \"Uh, no…\" \"Seriously? It's been all over the news for a whole week!\" James exclaimed. Tommy laughed weakly. \"Well, that's me. I may as well live under a rock.\" James laughed. \"Well apparently, he stole all his songs off some tranny, then she stalked him all around the US, then they met up again in a car, then they crashed, and now he still won't admit to song theft. What a fucking prick!\" Tommy laughed and put on a fake smile, though inside he felt sick. He tried, inconspicuously, to shrink into his seat. \"Guess you're not a big fan of him, then?\" Tommy asked. \"Can't stand him. He has good songs, but his voice is so whiny! And the songs aren't even his! \"Rock icon\" my arse!\" Tommy felt worse. No, Tommy Gnosis is another person. Gnosis is the fucking prick. I'm just Tommy Speck, plain old Speck . He tried to comfort himself, but he still felt so horrible. \"Speaking of Tommy Gnosis. You look a lot like him! No offence, of course. Even though I don't like his songs, I have to admit- I'd root him, given the chance.\" Tommy perked up at the sound of that idea, but tried to hide it. \"Yeah, a lot of people say I look like him.\" He lied. \"Except for your nose, your noses look completely different.\" Tommy smiled, his fear now gone. The waitress reappeared with their drinks and biscuits. They sat quietly, sipping their coffee. \"So Steven, what brings you here?\" \"Uh-Just relaxing, you?\" \"I've just come here for a few days to see my sister and I had a bit of jet lag- thought some coffee might do me good.\" \"Where do you come from?\" \"California.\" \"You're a bit pale for a Californian\" Tommy smiled. \"The miracles of sunscreen!\" James laughed. For hours, James and Tommy talked about themselves. Where they were from, how they got here, and where they planned on going in life. James told the story about how he was kicked out of his house after coming out of the closet to his parents when he was only 16. Tommy told the story of how he had met the most brilliant person, but had thrown it all away- not the complete truth, he thought, but truthful enough. James quickly gulped down the last of his coffee and looked outside. \"The rain's gone,\" he muttered quietly. He stood up from his seat. \"Where are you going?\" Tommy asked. \"I think it's time for me to get a taxi to my sister's.\" \"Will I see you again?\" Tommy asked- hoping the answer would rhyme with \"mess.\" \"I hope so.\" James smiled, which Tommy returned. James turned towards the door of the café and walked a few steps, before turning around and walking back to Tommy. \"By the way, what's your last name, Steven?\" \"Speck.\" Then, James did the un-expected; he bent over towards Tommy and kissed him right on the lips. All too son, James drew back again. \"Steven Speck,\" he whispered. \"That's a nice name. Dozo yoroshiku.\" James walked out of the café in confidence. Leaving Tommy Speck blushing in his seat. \"Dozo yoroshiku.\" Tommy whispered. AN: So there you go! I'm still wondering if it's going to be a one-shot or not..

Will Abbey and Larten stay together or will Kaname Kuran intervene? Abbey goes on an adventure with her brother Harry on a quest to bring down the person who murdered their parents. Find out more inside…. Abbey Jasper 5/20/2011 The best treasure of them all! Chapter 1- Graveyard= (Set in a graveyard) As we walked across the dark, gloomy graveyard we heard a groaning behind us. As Larten, Vampie and I turned around the only thing or monster was Darren. \"What? Why is everyone staring at me?\" said Darren looking puzzled. \"Darren were staring at you because well, are you hungry?\" asked Vampie. \"Well yeah I am hungry.\" Darren said. \"Well at least we know what the noise is, so can we please get moving! Were losing the night!\" I said angrily. \"Okay, Okay.\" Darren said annoyingly. (Now set walking in a street full of people) So we walked on towards the Weasly's house, I and Larten hand in hand, Vampie beside us and Darren behind. As the night wore on we finally reached a hotel to stay in just for the morning so that we can leave at night. Whilst Vampie was asleep snoring his head off, I and Larten was talking away, when out of the blue he said, \"Abbey you know if I die, I will love you know no matter what.\" \"I love you too Larten.\" I said kissing him. After when I kissed him; he thought for a couple of seconds and kissed me passionately lots of times. After the kissing he pulled back and smiled. Then after a minute starring into each other's eyes, we were just about to kiss again when Vampie woke up in a dizzy sleepy mood. \"Oh sorry was I disturbing something?\" Vampie asked. \"Oh no Vampie you weren't disturbing anything!\" Larten said sarcastically. \"I'll leave you two in a minute, just let me get dressed and I'll be out of your way.\" Said Vampie. As Vampie was getting dressed I and Larten was pretending to be asleep. I on his stomach, and him stroking my hair ( romantic or what!) When Vampie left the room I and Larten both got dressed, and went into the living room, where Darren and Vampie were. Darren prepared food for me, Larten and Vampie it was rare steak! This was really nice as it has lots of BLOOD! After waiting for our food to settle, so that we can get to the Weasly's house and discuss about the Lord of the Vampenze and Lord Voldemort . So when night fell we set out again to the Weasly's. Darren was on Larten's back (as Darren cannot flit as he is not a full vampire) I and Vampie just flitting as normal without anyone on our backs. After a while of flitting we reached the centre of town, when I spotted Dobby so I shouted, \"Dobby, Dobby come here!\" When Dobby saw me, he ran as fast as he could, as he finally got near us, he squeaked, \"Miss Potter you is here, you is here, you must leave immediately as deatheaters approach!\" \"What! Deatheaters where?\" I started to sound worried. \"Don't worry miss, I've already told the order you will be safe.\" Dobby squeaked. \"Okay thank you Dobby.\" I said sighing with relive. Just as I said that Sirius Black ( my godfather), Remus Lupin, Tonks and mad-eye moody all popped up at once. Lupin and Tonks running towards me, with Sirius and mad-eye running behind them. When Lupin and Tonks reached us, they both gave us all hugs, and then they both said, \"Abbey as Dobby has already told you, you ALL need to get out of here, there's a portkey waiting for you in the pub just round the corner to send you to the Weasly's.\" \"Okay we'll go but what about you guys would you be okay?\" I said. \"We'll be fine, don't you think we can't handle a couple of deatheaters!\" Sirius added. \"I think you can, I'm just worried that's all.\" I added. \"Okay then we'll see you at the Weasly's okay?\" Sirius asked. \"Oh ok then we'll see you there.\" I agreed. When we all parted we set off for the pub. After a couple of minutes we reached the pub and went upstairs. When we stood in front of the portkey, we all stood back and took a breath, then I stepped forward and told everyone to grab on to the portkey... Chapter 2- The Weasly's= When we finally fell, we fell on our backs and we could all see that we landed into a kitchen. BUT WHO'S! We found that out in a couple of seconds. \"Abbey is that you?\" asked a familiar voice. \"Ow my head.\" I said getting up and rubbing my head. \"Oh hey Mrs Weasly, yeah it's me Abbey.\" I said back. \"Oh ABBEY. I thought you were hurt or something by how long you took.\" Mrs Weasly said hugging and crying on me! I heard Fred and George's voices say Abbey's here, and Harry, Ron, Hermione and Kyra say no way and came running down the stairs. As soon as Kyra spotted Darren she blushed and giggled, \"Hi Darren.\" \"Hi Kyra.\" Darren sutured. \"Oh hi Abbey, Larten and Vampie.\" Kyra said just noticing us! We just nodded. \"ABBEY!\" Harry shouted giving me a big, hard hug. \"Hey Harry.\" I said only managing to breath. I coughed. \"Oh sorry Abbey.\" Harry laughed. \"That's alright it didn't even hurt.\" I lied. \"Right...\" Harry said sarcastically. I punched Harry in the arm laughing. \"Hey Abbey do you want me to show you to your room?\" asked Mrs Weasly. \"Oh okay then.\" I said uncertain. \"It'll be okay.\" Whispered Larten hugging me around the waist. (Going upstairs/ in the bedroom) So I and Mrs Weasly walked up the stairs towards the room that I'll be staying in. \"So you and Larten are pretty serious now right.\" Mrs Weasly asked. \"Yeah we have been for over 250 years now why?\" I asked. \"Well I thought you no... You and Larten were going to get married.\" Said Mrs Weasly. \"Oh erm... well the vampire way doesn't work like that. When you're with the one you love you can only stay with them for 10 maybe 20 years, and then we have to take a break for 10 years, but me and Larten don't do that as we are madly in love and has stayed with each other before we even became vampires.\" I said sadly. As there was a couple minutes of silence, I was thinking about what I said about love the vampire way. I thought how unfair it was, when I go back to Vampire Mountain, I must speak to Paris (who will come in later, Vampire Mountain is another story for another time.) \"Well here's your room and if you want Larten in here you can.\" Mrs Weasly said. \"Thanks Mrs Weasly.\" Abbey said. When Mrs Weasly went back downstairs, Abbey went into the room it look really romantic. I closed the door and went back downstairs, when I heard Vampie say to Larten, \"Larten you know you've only get a year left together.\" \"I know but I love her so much, I don't want to have a break.\" said Larten truthfully. I started to cry when I heard this. After a couple of minutes of crying I finally stopped and went downstairs. \"Hey Abbey.\" Vampie said as he spotted me coming down the stairs. \"Hey.\" I said. \"So what are you going to do today then?\" Vampie said. \"I'm going out shopping with Mrs Weasly.\" Abbey said. \"Oh okay, so what are you going to buy?\" Vampie asked. \"It's for me to know and for you to never find out.\" Abbey said. \"Oh okay then.\" Vampie said thinking hard. Abbey thought that he's thinking about how he can sneak into the room that she's staying in and see what I've brought. \"Abbey are you ready, oh and Tonks and Harmony are coming as well.\" Mrs Weasly shouted up the stairs. \"Yeah I'm ready.\" Abbey replied. After about a minute Tonk's, Mrs Weasly and Hermione can downstairs. \"You ready?\" Tonk's asked. \"You bet.\" Abbey replied. As Abbey said that Larten gave her a big hug and a passionate kiss to say goodbye. After they all said goodbye to Vampie, Darren and Larten we set of down the town to have some girl fun. Chapter 3- Hogsmead= (Downtown= Hogsmead) As me, Tonk's, Mrs Weasly and Hermione went into the Hogsmead (I am a wizard and am one of the vampire princes) and got some butter beer's in the three broomsticks. We saw Kyra coming over to our table. \"Hey Abbey.\" Said Kyra, ignoring everyone else on the table, which I think is a bit rude. \"Oh hey Kyra.\" I said annoyed. \"Is it alright if I ask you something?\" asked Kyra. \"Sure, shoot.\" I said wanting to know what all of this was all about. \"Erm... In private.\" Kyra said. \"Oh okay.\" I said in an uncertain voice. As I followed Kyra upstairs to a room where no one can listen, I was thinking about why she needs to talk to me. After a few seconds of thinking about it, it clicked to me! Back when me, Darren, Vampie and Larten came to the Weasly's and how she was talking to Darren. Oh no I think she fancy's him! Awww that's so sweet. After going up four flights of stairs we finally got to the room. She closed the door and locked it, at this moment in time it felt like she was going to kill me or something. \"What I wanted to say was, can you give me some advice on how to get Darren to notice me that way.\" Kyra said. \"Oh I never knew you felt that way about Darren, why didn't you talk to me about it before?\" I asked. \"Whever or not I wanted to, you were always with someone but you were never alone.\" Kyra shrugged. \"Oh okay well the best advice I have for you is just be, yourself in a friendly and flirty sort of manner then he'll notice you.\" I said. \"Thanks for the tip Abbey I'll keep that in mind.\" Kyra said. \"No problem.\" I said. After that chat with Kyra I actually don't take my own advice which is kind of stupid, I think I should try it out on Larten. I also think that Harry should go out with Ginny, but they can't not when Lord Voldemort is alive. (Later on in the day). When the shopping trip was finally over we all headed home (which was the Weasly's house); after a couple of seconds of dissaperating and reappearing we finally came to the Weasly's house, by this time it was night. Out of nowhere we saw Sirius and Snape (a professor I'll tell you about in the story later) were having a proper fight with fists and everything! Finally I decided to break them back with a lovely spell I like to call, \"STUPIFY!\" I shouted. They both got hit with the spell, and went flying thorough the air an eagle with a broken wing, it was actually very funny. Both looked at me with mixed faces, Serius with pride and glory, and Snape with anger and announce. \"Sorry I had to do it, otherwise you two were going to rip each other up and I didn't really want to watch that.\" I said admitting my true feelings. \"Well I never...\" Snape said practically shaking with anger. As he said that he stood up and dissaperated into thin air. \"Are you going to tell me what all that was about?\" I asked Serius. \"Not yet, later okay.\" Serius said in a husky voice, whipping off the blood from his mouth. Suddenly out of the blue, we all heard a very dark spell being cast; all the wizard's looked up at the sky and saw the dark mark (it means that Voldemort is coming back from the dead), terror on our faces we all ran inside to discuss what we have just seen. (Inside the Weasly's house) \"What was that thing Abbey?\" asked Darren and Harry at the same time. \"That mark up in the sky, was the sign of Lord Voldemort rising up again and it looks like he's growing stronger and stronger the longer we don't find those horcruxes Harry.\" I said looking out of the window remembering the day when I watched my parents die right in front of me. \"Abbey, I'm going to ask you something very serious. Have you been feeling weird, having weird visions or bad dreams?\" Asked Sirius seriously. \"Well yeah, in the matter of fact I have they've been really hurting my head when I'm sleeping, so then I wake up and my scar hurts. Why what does all this mean?\" I asked. \"Don't worry, just sit down and I'll explain everything once it is all over.\" Sirius said. I closed my eyes, and waited for the spell to hit me. As it hit me, a very warm but a cold feeling swept through my body, then out of the blue I could see the first time me and Larten kissed, when I saw my parents die, when I was at school and Larten, Darren and the cirque du freak came; then blackness as I came rushing back to reality I felt dizzy as in proper dizzy like the type of dizzy that you can't get up from. \"Abbey, Abbey can you hear me?\" Sirius said shaking me. \"Urgh my head... Why am I on the floor...? And stop shaking me\" I asked in a daze. \"You're on the floor because you fell off the chair, and before you ask yes I can explain what that was all about okay?\" Sirius said in a calming voice. \"Okay...\" I said still in a daze but a bit better. \"Come on let's get you back up on the chair, add a girl.\" Said Mrs Weasly putting me onto the chair. \"What I just did was, well I was trying to get into your mind just like you-know-who when you're sleeping but I'm going to teach you and Harry to block him out is that alright?\" Sirius said getting down to my height. \"Yes that's alright, but don't EVER do that to me again you can do it to Harry instead.\" I said getting myself a bit worked up but finding what I said about Harry a bit funny. \"Sure I'll use Harry next time instead.\" Sirius said laughing. \"Hey, I'm right here I can hear what you guy's are saying you know!\" Harry said sounding angry. \"Come on let's all just get packed for Hogwarts, I think the cirqu du freak is coming back I don't know.\" Said Mrs Weasly... Chapter 4- Hogwarts school= \"No, no, no Abbey you have it all wrong Wester wouldn't do that he'll do it in style!\" Emphasised Larten. \"Okay fine I agree with you but who always won a fight between me and him?\" I asked giggling. \"Okay you did, but I don't really see what the point is, what is the point?\" Larten asked. \"Who cares about a stupid point, god can you two please stop having a debate we're almost at Hogwarts!\" Said Harry sounding annoyed. \"Yeah, your voices are starting to get really annoying.\" Ron said with a mouth full of every box of every flavoured beans. \"Fine! We won't talk to each other then, we'll just sit side by side! Oh and Ron, you've got dirt on your nose.\"I said leaning on Larten's stomach. \"Thanks for embarrassing me Abbey, god your soo annoying!\" Ron said exaggerating. \"Shouldn't you be getting ready, we're nearly there.\" Abbey said smiling. (Insider the great hall). \"Wow, the hall hasn't changed at all.\" Said Abbey in amazement. \"And how long have you not been back here?\" Harry asked. \"Over 50 years why?\" Abbey asked suspiously. \"I'm just wondering.\" Harry said looking at Ron with a nod. Dumbledore then spoke. \"Welcome to a new term at Hogwarts, I hope you all had a good summer. Now down to business, we have two messages to get through. The first one is, the new defence against the darks arts teacher has now been fore filled by, Professor Umbridge now for-.\" Everyone now turned to Professor Umbridge, who got up from her chair and started to make her way to Dumbledore. Abbey was speechless and so were the rest of the staff, no one, no one , has ever interrupted Dumbledore when he was speaking even if they wanted to! \"She was at my hearing, Abbey.\" Said Harry leaning closer. \"You had a hearing with the ministry! We will discuss this later!\" Abbey speaking through her mind giving Harry the most dirty look possible for a vampire. \"Well Professor, would you like to speak to the students?\" Said Dumbledore, already knowing the answer. \"Oh yes, Dumbledore if you don't mind.\" Said Umbridge walking up to the stand. \"Hello students, as you heard from Dumbledore I am the new defence against the dark arts teacher. I also work with the ministry of magic, so be warned, one seriously wrong move could get you sent up to Azkaban. I'm just kidding. But I would like to say that some of the ministry is going to be taking over some of the school as well as some of its rules. We all hope that each and every one of you smiling at me right now, should be getting 'A' to 'A*'s.\" No one was smiling when she was done. Only about three, one including Dumbledore clapped at the most horrifying speech anyone has been forced to listen too. \"Well now, what a really good speech, please students I hope you give Professor Umbridge the warm, caring welcome that she deserves.\" Said Dumbledore looking at Abbey, Fred and George Weasly and gave them a small wink that only they could see. \"Well now for the second message, the Hogsmead trip letter signed by your guardian should be handed into Professor Magonical.\" Dumbledore said. \"Oh no, I forgot.\" Harry moaned. \"You forgot what Harry?\" Abbey said suspiously. \"The letter to Hogsmead, Uncle Vernon didn't sign it...\" Harry sighed. \"And why's that?\" Abbey said gritting her teeth. \"Well... I sort of blew up Uncle Vernon's sister.\" Harry said innocently. \"You what!\" Abbey gagged when she was drinking her drink. \"Now let the feast begin.\" Dumbledore said rising his arms.

Author's Note: If you are planning to review, please read my profile first. Might save you some time. I just saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch performed live, and I feel it is probably impossible for me to do justice to something so amazing and inspiring. Still, I do enjoy my escapism. I apologize in advance for what must certainly be an unworthy tribute, and extend that apology to any other stories I may write in this fandom. I borrowed a few background details from im36degrees, and I am grateful to that writer for coming up with them. Impressions Krystal stared at her reflection in the big dressing room mirror, looking for flaws. She decided the lipstick was too red. A darker rose shade would be better. Frustrated, she began wiping it off. \"Take it easy, sweetheart\", Tabitha said, puffing on her cigarette. \"You look beautiful.\" Tabitha was perched on a folding chair in the nearest corner of the little room, and she took care to smile encouragingly every time her friend met her eyes in the mirror. She wasn't working tonight, but when she'd heard about Krystal's crazy idea she'd decided to come along. Krystal was too optimistic for her own good, and far too sensitive. As her best friend, Tabitha would be there to comfort her and make sure she was okay when this plan inevitably failed. \"Five minutes!\" the stagehand called. Krystal took a deep breath, composing herself. She had been performing since she was 17, and she usually wasn't nervous at all. But tonight was different. Everything depended on tonight. Tonight she was opening the show for an American rock band called Hedwig and the Angry Inch. The lead singer had managed to escape from Communist East Berlin. She would understand what it was like to be trapped in a bad situation. She would understand, and she would help her. \"I've got to go.\" Standing up, Krystal faced Tabitha. They clasped hands, because a hug might mess up Krystal's hair or dress. \"I'll miss you, Tabby. Thanks for everything.\" \"Don't start composing your farewell speech yet, sister.\" \"This will work. I know it will.\" Tabitha sighed. \"Well, just in case it doesn't, you know I'll be waiting for you.\" Krystal nodded and gave Tabitha a last long look, trying to memorize every detail. Tabitha had been her best friend and surrogate older sister for three long years. When they'd met, Krystal had been a newly homeless teenage boy wandering the streets of Zagreb with no idea where to go or what to do. Tabitha had taken him home with her, and helped him become the woman he was meant to be. Leaving Tabby was hard. Turning away, she strode out onto the stage. Under the bright light, in front of the crowd, Krystal was in her element. She was beautiful and sexy and alluring. Her voice conveyed innocence and passion mixed together into something which seemed to hold the audience spellbound. She sang two songs, and left the stage to loud applause and whistles. Backstage, she got her first look at Hedwig. Krystal stood back against the wall so as not to get in the way of Hedwig and her band when they went on. She thought Hedwig was breath-taking. Then she heard what Hedwig was saying. Hedwig was arguing animatedly with a woman in a pants suit. The woman looked flustered and responded in a cajoling tone that became ever more pleading. Behind them, four men who were obviously the other band-members watched Hedwig with expressions ranging from incredulity to resignation. \"I'm not following that show-boating lounge singer!\" \"Please, Hedwig, you're every bit as good as-\" \"As good? As good? I'm a hell of a lot better ! That applause should be for me!\" \"It is , dear! You're the main act! You're the one everyone's here to see!\" \"Well that's too bad, because I'm leaving.\" Hedwig cast a furious look at her band, and two of the four quickly moved to follow her. The other two (temps that Phyllis had hired to play with them while they were in Croatia) stayed where they were, staring. \"Is she serious?\" one asked the other in an undertone. Tabitha nudged Krystal. \"Come on, honey. Let's go home.\" Krystal looked from Tabitha's kind face to Hedwig's retreating form. \"She's horrible, isn't she, Tabby?\" \"Yeah, she kind of is.\" Krystal's heart was racing. She knew her only chance to get out of Croatia was rapidly disappearing. They'd only have to be married for a month or two at most. Hedwig would probably reject her anyway, but she had to try. She couldn't keep living like this. \"Bye, Tabitha,\" she said, and hurried away from her friend before she could lose her nerve. She caught up to the group outside. \"Ms. Hedwig?\" Hedwig spun around, glaring. Her manager looked nervous. Trying to sound bold and confident, Krystal looked Hedwig in the eyes and said the lines she'd practiced for the last week. \"Please, Ms. Hedwig, I have to get out of this place. Will you marry me?\" Hedwig's glare slowly faded. She laughed, though not unkindly. \"You're not my type.\" \"We don't have to stay married. I just want to get out of here. Away from Croatia.\" \"An… interesting proposal,\" Hedwig said, eyeing Krystal speculatively. \"What's in it for me?\" \"I'll do whatever you want. I don't have any money, but… anything else you want,\" she finished, looking at the ground now. The confidence had died out of her voice. Hedwig was silent for a long time. At last she said, \"Let's discuss this somewhere more comfortable, just the two of us. Don't wait up, boys.\" She turned and walked away without waiting for a response. Krystal followed her. They found an all-night diner and Hedwig ordered them both coffee. They sat in silence until the waitress brought the cups and left. Hedwig took a sip, set her cup down, and said, \"What do you look like as a guy?\" \"What?\" Krystal asked, hoping she had misheard. Hedwig rolled her eyes. \"Don't waste my time.\" It's only for a couple of months , Krystal reminded herself. She couldn't shake the feeling that Hedwig was toying with her. \"I have dark brown hair\", she said uncertainly. \"Let me explain something, baby, before you get yourself into something you can't handle. Let Auntie Hedwig tell you the facts of life. I won't have another queen traveling with me. You have a good voice, Krystal, but that's all you have. And it's not enough. If you were a man, I might let you come with me. Or maybe not. But,\" and she leaned forward across the table, \"I'll be damned if I'm going to marry a fucking woman .\" \"I guess I could be male while we were together. Um… I don't think I can… you know?\" Krystal finished in a whisper. She hadn't expected this to be so degrading. \"I think I can live without… you know ,\" Hedwig said, her tone low and mocking. She crumpled her cup and left it on the table as she stood. \"Let's go.\" Krystal obediently followed her from the shop. She didn't ask where they were going.

If you're in Arizona I'll follow you If you're in Minnesota I'll be there too We'll have a million chances To start anew Because my love is endless for you He stole her songs and in so doing, stole her soul.

He has such a beautiful, fucked up relationship with Hedwig that I should love him, but... meh. This is the story of my favourite of Hedwig's love interests, and the only guy that wasn't a complete bastard. Obviously, I don't own anything. I also tend to refer to Yitzhak using male pronouns and Hedwig using female pronouns. I don't really have much of a reason for doing that, other then, well, I had to pick definitive genders for the purpose of writing this and in my mind that's the best fit for them. It's not a big part of the story and if it doesn't agree with the way you think of them try and ignore it :) oh and flashbacks= italics! Now, finally, enjoy! \"It is clear that I must find my other half. But is it a he or a she? What does this person look like? Identical to me? Or somehow complementary? Does my other half have what I don't? Did he get the looks? The luck? The love? Were we really separated forcibly or did he just run off with the good stuff? Or did I? Will this person embarrass me? What about sex? Is that how we put ourselves back together again? Or can two people actually become one again?\" -Hedwig It was lucky really, him being a girl. Amazing how much of an impact genitalia can have on our lives. When I said yes to his proposal the only person more surprised than me was him. He talked a good game- that was part of what attracted me to him- but he had no idea what he was doing. \"Hello,\" he said awkwardly, staring up at me from the bottom of the stairs. \"My name is Yitzhak. I'm your biggest fan. Will you marry me?\" ... \"Please. Take me away from this living hell.\" \"What's your name?\" \"Yitzhak, ma'm.\" \"Do you believe in fate, Yitzhak?\" I asked. He hesitated for a second. \"Not really, no.\" \"Neither do I,\" I said with a sarcastic smile. After an awkward second of silence, he laughed, a genuine, heartfelt laugh that made his eyes sparkle-yes, they fucking sparkled- and the deal was sealed. He was cute, he seemed sane and he was right there, looking straight at me, one hundred percent honest. He fucking needed me, and I needed to be needed for once. Not to be the hot but silly little girly boy relying on their lover for everything. He made me feel powerful again. \"Well then,\" I told him, smiling, \"I guess we're meant to be.\" And that was that. Really, how perfect could a courtship be? No drama, no bullshit. It all just fell into place rather nicely. I didn't love him then, of course. Honestly, I'm not even sure I do now... no, actually, that's a lie. I love him. How could I not? He's kind, gentle, unique and incredibly hot. I'm just not in love with him. My heart's otherwise engaged, shall we say. But when me and Yitzhak try and put ourselves back together it feels pretty perfect, for a bit. And when we lie together afterwards, just whispering the first things that come into our heads into the other's ear... I can't say there's nowhere else I'd rather be, but there are very few places for sure. We got married later that week. I'd like to say that it was an important day, but it wasn't, not really. An old man with a balding head read out vows and filled on forms; we recited them and signed our names on dotted lines. \"I do,\" he said impatiently, checking the time on his watch. And then, a couple of minutes later it was my turn. \"I do,\" I said with a wry smile, wondering what I was really promising. Sure, I'd heard the vicar's fancy words numerous times, but how about in real life? When you look into someone's eyes and say those two words what are you telling them? That they can have your love? Your body? A part in your future? I realised then that I didn't really know, and for the first time since Yitzhak's proposal felt a bit guilty that we were abusing the sanctity of marriage like this. The whole affair was a bit of a letdown to be perfectly honest. We didn't even fuck on our wedding night- we hadn't made love at all by that point, actually. Imagine that, me waiting until marriage! No, instead, we caught a plane to America at two in the morning, me with a trolley full of stupid clothes, wigs and junk that had no real value to anyone but me; him with a single, heavy bag that he slung over his shoulder and neither of us with much money, but that didn't seem to matter. I can't remember much of that night, but I know that the sky looked really pretty. So big and dark- not in a scary way, just... an enormous way. And it looked so close, as if I could reach out and touch it if I tried, although when I did it only resulted in me breaking a pair of my favourite heels falling into Yitzhak's arms off a huge brick wall. \"Hold my handbag,\" I told him, hitching my skirt up and tucking the sides into my panties-ever so ladylikely of course! He took it from me but put it down on top of all my other bags rather than holding it. Then, as if he knew exactly what I was planning, grabbed my hand with both of his firm, strong ones and steadied me as I skipped onto the waist high brick wall running across the car park. He had to stretch to keep hold of me then, especially with my heels, but he didn't let go. I walked along it for a couple of meters until we got to the wall running around the outside. Squeezing his hands, I pulled him up onto the smaller wall and let him hoist me up, scrambling and fumbling as I tried to get my hands over the far side to pull myself up with. When I was stable I positioned one foot on each side of the wall- for it was one of those irritating structures that doesn't have a flat top but a pointed one- and straightened my legs. \"It's kind of a shame,\" I murmured too my new husband, \"that I'll never get to stand like this on top of the Berlin wall, don't you think?\" He shook his head. \"We already have, baby,\" he smiled up at me. I laughed and reached up to the sky, screaming excitedly as I almost lost my footing. \"Careful, Hedwig.\" \"Never,\" I replied jubilantly as I twisted to face him, but this time when I stumbled I didn't get my balance back immediately and instead tumbled towards him, my ankle twisting and my swearing loudly. Perhaps it would be romantisizing it a bit to say that he caught me- it really was more about breaking my fall, to be honest- but either way I ended up in his arms. \"Are you okay?\" He asked me, alarm filling his voice. I pouted and put the foot with the shoe on which the heel had broken on his lap. He laughed and squeezed me tight. \"Take them off. We'd better run if we want to make sure we catch the plane.\" He could sing. He wasn't a show off like me, wanting the attention on him all night-makes you wonder how he managed to do drag for so long-but if he had wanted it he could have had it, for sure. I didn't realise quite how good he was, though, until I heard him sing me to sleep one night on an almost empty bus... You'll be given love You'll be taken care of You'll be given love You have to trust it, Maybe not from the sources you have poured yours maybe not from the directions you are staring at, Twist your head around it's all around you all is full of love all around you, All is full of love you just aint receiving all is full of love your phone is off the hook all is full of love your doors are all shut all is full of love All is full of love All is full of love All is full of love All is full of love All is full of love I was glad when he offered to sing back up for me in the new band, and, only a couple of days after I'd agreed, came to me with a list of mediocre musicians that would be willing to join us. I told him that he could pick which ones we'd take. It didn't really matter much to me. He did a pretty good job. Skszp, Jacek, Krzysztof and Schlatko. Our audiences didn't have a chance in hell of remembering their names, but they were good people, mostly. Good fun too. They've always been able to irritate me like no other group of people on the planet, however. I'm not sure if it's their fault, my fault or the fault of too much time spent locked in cheap hotels together. A bit of both, I suppose. Yitzhak wasn't perfect either- just a person bumbling through life and trying to make the best of things. But that was okay, because I didn't expect him to be anything else. My only regret is that I'll never be able to love him in the way that I'm just realising he loves me. As much as he means to me, he's not my other half, but somehow it seems as though I am his. The song Yitzhak sings to Hedwig is originally by Bjork, but I was listening to Death Cab for Cutie's version. Thanks for reading and I hoped you enjoyed it :) this is really different to the usual generic Twilight fanfic I do so if you have any comments I'd love to hear them! xoxo ","Summary":" AN: Tommy never really did much for me.

Author's Note: If you are planning to review, please see my profile first. Might save you some time. This story takes place about a month after the events shown in the movie. I concede that Yitzhak may well have become Krystal permanently after that, the way Hansel was Hedwig all the time. But in my version, he is only Krystal on stage and remains a male the rest of the time. I base this on the belief that Hansel/Hedwig would not be attracted to a woman, as well as my own preference for writing male characters. Also, I'm assuming Hedwig went back to using the name Hansel but continues to use Hedwig as a stage name and the name of his band. I used an online translation site for the German and Croatian words, and I apologize for any errors. The Other Shoe A lot had changed in the last month, and it was hard to believe that Hedwig no longer existed. She was gone, completely replaced by this man, Hansel. Not that Yitzhak minded. Hansel was much kinder and gentler than Hedwig had been, much happier. Hansel deserved that after all this time, but that didn't mean it wasn't hard to get used to. Yitzhak had never once seen his wife out of drag during the first eight years of their marriage. Not even once, and he had known better than to ask. It had been over a month, and most mornings he was still startled when he turned over in bed and found a man sleeping next to him. This morning he opened his eyes, looked around their hotel room (a nice room that they had all to themselves) and made a point of remembering where he was and whom he was with. When he thought he had it sorted out and felt okay about it, he turned to face Hansel. Hansel was beautiful. Yitzhak had always felt that Hedwig was the single most glamorous person he had ever seen, and when he would lie there silently in the mornings and watch Hansel sleep it was impossible to decide which one was more breath-taking. But as soon as Hansel woke up, there was no question about it. For years he had been resigned to the fact that Hedwig would never really be happy with him. In the most important sense, he had never been her husband. He had been a valuable asset to her band, and she had been his only way out of Croatia. She'd soon become more to him, but he'd never become more to her. Hansel, though… When Hansel turned that warm smile on him, or embraced him after a performance and kissed him right there on the stage, Yitzhak could actually believe for a few minutes that Hansel loved him. That was very nearly blissful. It never lasted; he still deeply believed that he wasn't good enough to be really loved, but for some reason his amazing, beautiful, talented partner seemed willing to pretend. And he could make due with that. Slowly waking up, Hansel stretched and murmured, \"Good morning, meine liebe.\" Noticing Yitzhak's admiring gaze, Hansel asked innocently, \"What are you thinking about?\" \"You're perfect.\" Yitzhak shook his head. \"You're too perfect. I keep thinking I'm going to wake up.\" Rolling on top of him, Hansel playfully pinned his shoulders to the bed and kissed him deeply. When they broke the kiss they were both slightly breathless. \"Awake now?\" \"God, I hope so.\" Hansel laughed and got up. \"You go ahead and shower first. I'll order breakfast\", he said, slipping on one of the robes the hotel provided. Yitzhak got up and headed for the bathroom. He turned around in the doorway, hesitating. \"What's wrong?\" Hansel asked, a bit of concern creeping into his voice. \"It's just… well, it's… nothing.\" And he turned and went into the bathroom, closing the door gently behind him. Once the door was closed, Yitzhak leaned against it and closed his eyes. He'd come close to saying, \"I love you.\" He'd wanted to say it for the past month. But actually doing it would be stupid. All of this, Hedwig getting over Tommy; Hedwig, who looked at him with such disdain, becoming Hansel, who seemed to love him; the band finally making it, going from playing in front of a couple dozen embarrassed or overtly homophobic diner patrons to playing real concerts in front of over a thousand cheering fans. All of it was just too good to be true. He was sure it wouldn't be too long now before it all fell apart. Hansel would find another man, a better-looking one. Yitzhak knew his voice was good, but he also knew he wasn't the only guy with a good voice. To use an American idiom, Yitzhak was waiting for the other shoe to drop. After a moment, he pushed himself away from the door. Hansel would be waiting to use the shower, so he'd better hurry. He quickly undressed and turned the water on as hot as he could stand. Closing his eyes, he tried to pretend this would last forever. Hansel would always love him. When they weren't on tour, maybe they could have a house somewhere. They'd write knew songs and sing them together. Things would never revert to the way they had been for so many years. He was abruptly jolted out of his daydreaming when a pair of hands touched his shoulders. Someone was in here with him! With a half-choked scream he jerked away, slipping on the wet floor. A strong arm caught him and pulled him back against a firm, smooth chest. Someone was speaking loudly ( angrily ). He clawed at the restraining arm, terrified. A hand came up in front of his face and he bit it. There was a muffled curse from his attacker. Then he was forced around to face the other man and shoved back against the shower wall, pinned there. Desperate, he drew in his breath and screamed. The other man slapped him and then clamped a hand over his mouth. Still speaking loudly ( aggressively ), although Yitzhak could not understand any of the words, the stranger used his weight to force Yitzhak to the shower floor. He slapped him again, lightly ( tauntingly ). Curling up, Yitzhak began to cry. The arms were around him now, and fuck , he didn't want this to happen. For a long moment nothing did happen. Maybe he'll go away! Forcing himself to speak, Yitzhak pleaded, \"Ugoditi ne nanositi povredu mene. Ugoditi. Te mogao pravedan dopust! Ja nece reci bilo tko!\" A hand was gently stroking his back. He focused on that, and gradually the voice sounded less angry and threatening. The stranger was singing, now, a slow, sad song that Yitzhak usually sang lead on during shows. \" Hedwig? \" \"Close, meine liebe.\" \"Hansel\", Yitzhak corrected himself, looking up at his mate. His relief was too great for words, but Hansel understood. They held each other as the hot water continued to fall down on them both.

Notes: An attempt at Hedwig's point of view. Disclaimer: Don't own. Midnight Radio Crisscrossed and thickly woven polyester fabric grates against my bare thighs as I stumble back into the cheap loveseat pushed up flush against the faux wooden paneling of my trailer. Old squealing springs and moldy cushions give way beneath me as my knees knock together. Sweet breath slips from my smudged lips, the taste of viscous pink gloss suddenly poison in my mouth. It is the same air that he pressed inside my body from his own only a few seconds prior, so fleeting and intangible, a small attempt to make us whole for maybe a moment before it inevitably slips away. My meticulously manicured fingernails chip and splint, tearing apart into tatters as I twist the course fabric beneath me. The beautifully constant pitter-patter racket of the rain continues its steady downpour, undeterred. Thin metal collides with the frame, the backdoor still rattling from where Tommy tore it open to flee, ashen face and disgusted. How can he be the one? How can he not? It was so fucking perfect. An astonishingly crystallized emotion was suddenly emblazoned so completely in his clear blue eyes. Shining so open and waiting for me to reach out and grasp it. Looking into his eyes I could do anything, he could become anything, we could build something together that was not there before. Sweet and pure creation, devoid of the complexity of procreation and messy recreation. It was in that moment I knew. When his thin lips finally touched mine, his intoxicating breath swirling about in my lungs, I knew that he, Tommy Speck, my own Tommy Gnosis, was my other half. The long lost piece of myself I had been desperately searching for all the way from East Berlin to America. Along the way I found false promises and a broken marriage, everyone taking bits and pieces of my body and soul. A debris of painful love loss. But none I had met or come upon could begin to compare to the divine sense of completion that crashed through my body, shooting up my spine and wrapping, embedding itself so absolutely in my mind. He was the one who had been so wrongfully ripped from my body upon my metaphysical birth. He held the sacred, ancient knowledge that had been lost so long ago. This sweet, endearing Jesus freak of a boy held all the answers to my questions. Tommy, he could finish the senten— No. A discordant note cutting through the heavy air. Oh, no, no, no. The slip slide, ghosting of his fingertips grazing against the sharp bones of my thin hip, roughly shoved lower by my own hand between my legs to fin— \"My mom…\" Not Little Tommy Speck. This child, this boy , is too bound to the physical, the sickeningly commercial appearance. He is unable to reach beyond to the painfully metaphysic reality of a transcendent love—bringing us truly together, beyond the limiting mechanics of our God-given bodies. One being, one body, one voice to croon the other half of our heart to sleep in the all-encompassing darkness of eternity. Forever one, the eternal paradise regained. The sweet twinkling sound of finely shattered glass manages to drown out the unending noise of the trailer beside mine belting out a \" multi platinum single \" on loop for a scant moment. Smashed against the opposite wall, discounted vodka drips down the old paneling before pooling on the carpeted floor alongside the broken novelty glass I flung across the trailer. A thousand tiny pieces. Before I know what it is that I am doing I find myself on hands and knees. There are suddenly perfect little cuts and scraps littering the flesh of my palms and legs as I try to sweep up ever last shard of glass. I stop. The sharp fragments, stained a faint red, are glinting in the fading sunlight that pours in from my window. The brilliant Sun fades over the thin line of the horizon, just barely missing the sight of its old sister Moon. How could I expect him to be the missing piece when he is just a boy and I am so much more? Maybe there is no other half for me. Or perhaps I am my own, neither man nor woman, a great divide between blissful unity and agonizing separation. Or even more so, maybe I am the bridge linking the two, spanning across age, sex and all physical limitations and inhibitions. Though it really will not matter or make a difference. I had already given a piece of myself to Tommy Speck, who will take it and run, becoming the ever stylish ' rock and roll icon ' Tommy Gnosis.

Author's Note: If you are planning to review, please see my profile first. Might save you some time. To New Experiences! \"Yitzhak! Where are you, hon? I brought candy!\" Hedwig proclaimed, laughing, breezing through the door of the motel room and not bothering to close it behind herself. Yitzhak watched her warily from across the room, making no move to get up. Let her come to him, if she wanted to. Whatever she was talking about, the amused, almost mocking tone of her voice promised it wouldn't be pleasant. It didn't look like she was going to make it all the way across the room. Swaying with each step, she changed course and headed for the nearer of the two beds, then tripped over nothing and went sprawling. Yitzhak stood up, alarmed, and hurried over to her. She was still half laughing as he helped her to her feet and guided her over to sit on the bed. Once she was settled, he quickly closed the door she had forgotten about and locked it. \"Come over here, hon. Come- come join me on the bed\", she managed, and dissolved into laughter again. He hesitated, then went and sat down beside her. \"Are you drunk?\" he asked cautiously. She wasn't, though. Hedwig got morose when she was drunk, not like this. \"Don't be such a buzzkill. Brought you a present. Wait a minute.\" She was pawing through her purse, and then she pulled out a small plastic bag about a quarter filled with white powder. Dropping it between them on the bed, she looked at him expectantly. \"What is it?\" Hedwig stared at him for a long moment, enough time that he started edging carefully away. Then she fell back on the bed, shrieking in hilarity. Yitzhak got up and headed for the door. He could probably find Jacek or one of the others. \"Oh, fuck, don't be such a drama queen. Come here. I'll show you what it is.\" Then, with a hint of anger, \"Come here , you ungrateful thing.\" Like she was calling a dog. Shoulders slumped, he obeyed, because if he left now she would remember it. Hedwig took a mirror out of her bag and poured some of the powder onto it. Yitzhak watched dully as she made lines out of it. Then she took a rolled up dollar bill and handed it to him. Gesturing to the lines, she said, \"Snort it.\" Yitzhak briefly considered refusing, but she was looking at him contemptuously again. It was his least favorite of her expressions. So why the hell not? Tucking his dark hair behind his ears, he leaned down and snorted one of the lines. It was intense. Yitzhak lay back on the bed, breathing rapidly. The room was spinning, and all he could hear was a muffled roar, like wind rushing past the windows of the van. Now would be a good time to go find the others. Yes, he definitely wanted Jacek. Lots to talk about, lots of really important, frightening things. Something had to be done about them before someone died or disappeared or was attacked or got arrested- He sat up quickly. Whatever this stuff was, it was probably illegal. He cast a disbelieving glance at his companion. Didn't she know what would happen to her if she was caught? Then he realized he was looking at one of her wigs. She was gone. \"Hedwig?\" he called, looking around the room. The door was open. She had left and he hadn't even noticed! Oh god, this was bad. They'd catch her, and he knew all too well what would happen if some homophobe found her like this. He had to find her first, and make her come back to the motel before her little \"present\" got them both killed. He rushed out the door, barely noticing that he wasn't wearing shoes. No time, no time. He wanted to get the others. Shlatko would be more help in a fight than he could ever be. But there wasn't time. She could be dead right now! He took off running along a sidewalk littered with broken glass and beer cans. Meanwhile, Hedwig was looking for a convenience store. She felt wired. She'd hoped Yitzhak would want to do something fun once he was high, but he had kind of zoned out. Rolling her eyes, she had settled in to wait for him to snap out of it. She felt like running a damn marathon, he should at least be up to talking. After about 45 seconds, she had decided this was taking too long and left. Now she was vaguely thinking about bringing him bagels or donuts or coffee. Very strong coffee. Frankly, he was more fun sober. At this point, she noticed that she had forgotten her purse. This would be infuriating if it weren't so oddly hilarious. She started back, singing softly. She was halfway through the song, and really not paying much attention to her surroundings, when something hit her hard and knocked her to the ground. Sitting up, she was startled to see Yitzhak on the sidewalk a couple of feet away. He had run right into her, and she was briefly angry. \"Damn it, watch where the fuck you're going! You've ruined my dress!\" Then she realized that he had apparently moved past staring at the motel ceiling like a zombie and come looking for her. Maybe he wanted to do something fun, now. Yitzhak sat up. \"Hedwig! Come on, we have to go back!\" He got up and extended a hand to her, and she took it and stood up, too. Surprisingly, her dress wasn't torn. She'd have to have it cleaned, though. She allowed him to hurry her back to the motel, using the time to look him over. \"Why aren't you wearing shoes?\" \"No time! Please, Hedwig, we have to hurry! They're coming!\" \"Who's coming?\" He didn't answer, just pulled her wrist in an attempt to make her walk faster. They were approaching the parking lot already, for they had only been a couple of blocks away. Becoming annoyed again, she jerked her wrist away. There was blood on her sleeve. Now the dress was ruined. That would never come out. As soon as they were in the room, Yitzhak shut the door, locked it, and put the security chain on. Then he turned to Hedwig. \"Are you alright?\" \"Of course I am! What's the matter with you?\" Then she realized what was going on. So this was what he was like when he was high. His palms were scraped up from the fall, and he had left a trail of bloody footprints across the carpet. Now he sat there looking at his hands, or maybe the floor. Hedwig got up and he grabbed her sleeve again. She slapped his hand away, even though the dress was a lost cause. Like her. Like him. Like this whole relationship. \"Sorry\", he said quietly. \"Just- don't go, okay? They'll find you, and no one will stop them. I'll leave, if you want. Just please stay here.\" \"Don't move. I'll be right back.\" She went into the bathroom and returned with a wet cloth. Handing it to him, she said, \"You shouldn't go out without shoes. I don't have any peroxide.\" She walked over to the window and stared out at the parking lot. \"Look at us\", she mused quietly to herself. \"We don't even get high the same way.\" She turned back to her husband. \"Do you think we're met for each other, Yitzhak?\" \"No,\" he answered, miserably. \"You deserve better.\" Surprised and touched, she returned to sit next to him again. \"Lie down, go to sleep,\" she said gently. \"Things will be better in the morning.\" Late into the night, she thought about his reply to her question. You deserve better. She watched him as he slept, curled up as far over on his side of the bed as he could get without falling out. \"I was going to say the same thing to you,\" she whispered.

Death, the final curtain,nit was an impossibility growing realer by the moment and the pain ofnit was all sharp hooks and brutal knives. There was only darknessnaround him. The moon did not even dare penetrate the curtains. Thennight and its darkness – mirrored the well of pain that consumednHansel. He could not breathe; half of him was dead and gone now. Yes,nhis other half and his sworn enemy both the same boy with one facenand two terrible moods. The love of his life was a terrible boy, annothing boy who he himself had named Tommy Gnosis – and in so doingnhad created a rock and roll demigod. There was also a smallnTV. in this kitchen and it was now that Hansel reached across thentable at which he sat and switched it on. He sipped from the bottlenwith little thought as he flicked through the channels till he foundna late night news program.. Rock and Roll IconnTommy Gnosis 25 died today of a self inflicted gun shot wound to thenhead. Police are still investigating however, friends of the fallennstar have commented that Gnosis had been distraught since hisnrelationship with transsexual rock goddess Hedwig Robinson came tonlight early this year, when it was proven that Robinson had writtennmany of Gnosis popular singles including the international hit Originnof Love. And on and on the whinynvoiced news lady droned. Hansel had heard enough. He reached over andnswitched the TV set off and put his head upon the table. The sorrow he felt wasna raw, electric mass ripping up veins and ligaments and buryingnitself deep in his belly – were it turned on itself and festered.nThe pain was so awesome and huge it dwarfed all other tragedies andnills of Hansel complicated life. Why had he done it? Why thenbetrayal? Why did he just give in and give up without saying goodbye? He thought back to antime when he and Tommy had been in love.. He felt like an outsidersnas he looked back into his memories to spy on Hedwig and Tommy lyingnside by side on Hedwig's small bed. Their arms wrapped around onenanother. The air around them perfumed with the scent of musky perfumenand vanilla incense. \"Your hair smellsnlike youth.\" Hansel saw Hedwig's mouth say. The cherry red lipsnmoist and hot in the ear of her young lover, her long brilliantlynhued nails thick as thieves curving up around the edge of Tommy'snjeans and the young boy's mouth, a small O of pleasure replying innthe softest of moans. \"Hedwig… Hedwig.\"nHis voice had whispered over and over again – till the words were anmere chant and they dissolved into one another – searing andnmeshing their very souls into one complete being. It had been only anmoment - but it had been beautiful. I may not be whole butnI am whole – became Hedwig's mantra and it was all because ofnTommy. It was all for the love of a boy. But, as Hansel knew nownlooking back, He realized that they were never meant to be. He shouldnhave known back then when he was determined to become the woman thatneveryone wanted him to be – that he would fail. The charade couldnonly be kept up for so long and one day there would be only the ruinnof a half lived life. He had known this but even still he had nevernimagined that it would be destroyed over the love of a simple teenagenboy. A sweet innocent boy with huge eyes and a nervous laugh who henhad taken under his wing and molded for greatness only to be rewardedn– with lies and betrayal and down right robbery. Yet, now even still,nafter it all was said and done. The love was there and it was mockingnat the woman Hansel had tried to become. It said: Silly girl wantingnthe impossible, what young boy could love you… you have nothing tongive. What would Hedwig do?nWould Hedwig rise from the pain of this loss decked about in thenpaint and the sequins – the feathers and furs and the attitude?nWould she think that now even still after Tommy had done thenunspeakable that she would carry on the war she had waged with thenthieving child/boy she had once mentored and loved? Who was the onenwho lived and breathed it? Brought over from communist Germany? Or were all bets off? Now that the boy wasndead and all that was left was the ruined remains of a bleedingnheart. \"Somehow we werensupposed to come together again,\" Hansel whispered to the nearnempty bottle beside him. \"My Finest Crush –nMy beautiful boy.\" He sang in a throaty voice, raw with pain andnliquor. \"Must – I come backnnow – make some music and tell them our story.\" He whispered tonthe silence around him. In the dark of this room, he felt a smallnbreeze at his back and with it the awesome presence of someone. Tommy? The answer was clear;nit had been spoken straight from the mouth of that child/boy who hadnwith his huge dark eyes destroyed rock and roll. Hansel nodded tonhimself and stood, his feet unsteady. \"Yes that is it beautiful boyn– I must tell our tale – all of it – through the rock and thenroll – the music and I must bring back Hedwig – the woman whonloved you.\" The silence was of theneerie kind, and Hansel was sure now that it was in fact Tommynlistening in among the shadows, nodding in agreement. \"My finest crush –nmy beautiful boy – Do you know what you have done to me?\" –nHansel sang softly to himself as he stumbled down the hall towardsnthe telephone. He needed his band now – He prayed that they wouldncome and help him.

My name is Elizabeth Mary Fortis. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New york. My mother and father had me during their teenage years. Or more likely \"accidentally\" had me. My father was of course shocked to hear that he knocked up his girlfriend but, he was kind of glad. He was in love with my mother and wanted to \"live happily ever after\" with her and I. But it didn't turn out like that. The stress of responsibillity over a family was too much for him. He dropped out of school and started to work at a pizza resturant with a crappy salary. My mother tried to sell her art to get more money to help my father but, her paintings were only worth 3 to 20 dollars. They got desperate and asked my grandfather for money but, he just slammed the door in their faces. After two months of living of a small amount of money, my father became a drug dealer. He asked his friends for help and they made meth in a garage. Which, of course, is dangerous. But my father took that risk so he could take care of me and mother. He and his friends succeeded and sold the meth at secret clubs. He came home with the money and lied to my mother that he got a raise at his work. Of course, my mother trusted him and they could pay the rent. But, after a while my father started to take meth himself. He got addicted and wanted the meth alone. His \"customers\" got upset and told the cops about his drug making and they arrested him. My mother was heartbroken. She found out that my father was sentenced to 15 years in jail and wasn't allowed to be with her during the birth. She sold the apartment and saved the money my father had made from the drugs and moved in to my grandmother. Seven months later on a late winters night I was born. I was a small baby with big light blue eyes and coal black hair. My mother fell in love with me right away and named me Elizabeth. After Queen Elizabeth I, also known as \"The Virgin Queen\". She named me after her for her independence and wisdom. My middle name, Mary, is from Jesus's mother Mary. Because she's a saint. Or, what my mother says, an angel. She also thought it fitted due to our surname \"Fortis\", which is latin for \"Strength\". My father died in jail three years later from a fight in the cafeteria. My mother was crushed and mourned for many months. She was too upset to take care of me so my grandmother took care of me. My mother had locked herself in her room crying, refusing to eat or even sleep. She wouldn't let my grandmother in. Even if my grandmother cried outside her door and begged her to let her in but she refused. One day my grandmother didn't hear anything from my mother's room. No cries, no praying, no nothing. She knocked on my mother's door and asked if she was asleep but my mother didn't answer. After a long while banging and screaming on her door, she called the police. The police arrived and broke down the door. The room was empty and smelled foul. They saw that one of the wardrobe's door's was slightly open. They opened the wardrobe and inside was my mother, dead, hanged by a cable. My grandmother, Diana Fortis, is a strong woman. She was crushed by my mother's sudden death but, she still managed to collect herself and take good care of me like nothing had happened. My grandfather, Alekaej Fortis, divorced her when my mother was 12. He moved away but, close enough so my mother could visit him every now and then. He was furious to hear about my mother's pregnancy and shut her out. But, when he heard about my mother's suicide he regretted his selfishness. He was too upset to stay so, he moved to Michigan. Me and my grandmother lived alone in the house my mother grew up in. She taught me how to count, how to tie my own shoes, how to ride a bicycle and how to braid my hair. I didn't really care about not knowing much about my parents but, that changed when I started in Middle School. I got jealous of my classmates having parents that dropped them off with a goodbye-hug and later picked them up. Of course, my grandmother did this too but, it wasn't really the same. The parents had heard about the story of my parents and everytime I walked by with my grandmother they would whisper things like: \"There's the girl who lost her parents when she was a baby...\" \"That poor thing...\" \"I wonder if she even knew her parents...\" My grandmother would just tell me not to listen to their gossip but, I just couldn't help but feeling empty on the inside. In High School I was the left out dork. The girls would laugh at the way I dressed and point out my flaws. But I didn't really care since I was used to hear people talk behind my back. In school, I was the top student. I had straight A's and was never afraid to answer a question. But, that changed when I met him. Him, the boy who stole my heart by just five simple words: \"Can I borrow your pencil?\" And his name was Matthew Frick. A tall, broad shouldered young man. His hair was coffee brown in thick short curls. His eyes were as blue as the midnight sky with long curly lashes shadowing his cheekbones. And his skin was slightly tanned. I was so shocked by his apperence I could barerly talk: \"S-Sure.\" \"Thanks. Elizabeth, right?\" \"Uh, Y-yeah... I'm sorry but, what was your name again?\" \"Haha, I actually never mentioned my name but, it's Matthew.\" He reached out his delicately shaped hand and I shook it with my shaky and sweaty hand. The rest of the day, I kept thinking about that strange boy. Where did he come from? Is he new? How could I miss him? How did he know my name? When I came home from school I was so deep into my thoughts I almost walked past my grandmother sitting in the kitchen with a strawberry and whipped cream cake with my name on it saying: Happy Birthday Elizabeth! I was so shocked that I had forgotten my own birthday just because I was thinking about him ... My grandmother started to sing: Happy Birthday to you~ Happy Birthday to you~ Happy Birth- She stopped to sing when she saw my shocked expression. She looked at me for a while and then said: \"Sweetie, I was meant to surprise you. Not shock you.\" \"Oh, sorry. I had just forgotten that it was my birthday today...\" I said. She stared at me for a long time with a very shocked expression and said: \"What? You forgot your own birhtday? You NEVER forget anything! Did something happen in school?\" I started to think about Matthew again and said: \"No, nothing happened. I had a test today so I was probably concentrating on it so much I just forgot.\" She looked at me for a bit until she clapped her hands together and said: \"Oh well! That happens sometimes! Well, let's eat some cake now, shall we?\" The rest of the week I kept on thinking about Matthew. How sculpturedly shaped his face and cheekbones was. How mature his voice was. He was like a dream prince, minus the white stallion and armor. Soon it'll be Valentine's Day. Should I ask him out? No, why would he go out with the dorky orphan girl? He probably already have a girlfriend. But still... How did he know my name? My thougths got interrupted by a familliar voice: \"What are you so deep in thoughts about?\" the voice said. I turned to my left where the voice came from and there sits the same prince from last week. Matthew. I felt my cheeks start to blush and my hands started to sweat. \"O-oh, nothing...\" I said. He looked at me with a cute crooked smile. \"Nothing? Didn't look like nothing. Tell me. Or am I not allowed into your mind?\" he said. \"Uh, no. I mean, I was just thinking about the... Uhm. Finals.\" I said. \"The finals? You're such a smart girl, you don't need to worry about the finals!\" he said. I let out a nervous laugh: \"Ahaha... Thank you. I just want to get into my dream college.\" I said nervously. \"Oh really? Which college? Harvard?\" he said. \"Ah, no. I was thinking of New York City College of Technology. I want to be a Doctor.\" I said. \"Wow, really? You'll make it!\" he said. \"What about you?\" I said. \"I don't know. I'd like to be an Architect I guess.\" he said. \"Oh, cool.\" I said. I looked down at my book and started to think about something funny to say. Something, anything! \"Hey, I know this is sudden but... Do you want to go out on a date with me?\" he said. OH MY GOD! I felt my whole body shaking and my heart racing. Did he just ask me out? Me? The dorky orphan girl? I looked back at him and saw him looking at me with eyes full of hope. \"Uh... Uhm... Yeah, sure. It would be nice.\" I said. \"Great! How does Friday sound like? 6pm? I'll pick you up and we can maybe go and grab some pizza?\" he said. \"Yeah. That sounds great but, I have to ask my grandmother.\" I said. He looked at me with a confused expression. \"Your grandmother? Don't you mean your parents?\" he said. \"It's just that...\" I said staring down at my book again. \"It's just what? What is it?\" he said looking at me with a concerned look. \"My parents died when I was really young.\" I said. \"Oh shit! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean it like that!\" he said. \"No! It's okay! I'm used to it!\" I said. \"Sorry again... I didn't know.\" he said. \"It's fine.\" I said smiling at him. \"If we're still going out, I might need your number.\" he said \"Oh yeah! Sure.\" I said. We both picked up our mobiles and exchanged numbers. TO BE CONTINUED... ","Summary":" Chapter One: My name is Elizabeth Fortis. My name is Elizabeth Mary Fortis.

Stop it!\" Kristina screamed at the mongoose. \"Damn you!\" Without warning, she grabbed the gun out of the sheriff's hands. She aimed at the mongoose and pulled the trigger. Bang! The mongoose lay still as blood pooled around it. Kristina ran over to the snake. It lay quietly on the floor, wounded but still alive. \"David! Oh my God, David! What did Dad do to you?\" Kristina's hands shook as she knelt next to the cobra. \"David?\" Deputy Bock repeated. \"Wasn't your dad's assistant named David? Did your dad name the snake after him?\" He chuckled as the sheriff gave him a dirty look. \"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" he mumbled. \"I know this sounds crazy. I can't even believe it myself. This cobra is David. My dad...\" She hesitated, and looked directly at the lawmen. \"My dad... experimented on people. He turned Tim into a snake. Or tried to, anyway. I saw Tim at the carnival sideshow.\" Kristina covered her mouth with her hand and shook her head. \"It was just awful. I guess the experiment didn't work. Tim was caught somewhere in between.\" She stood up. \"David...hadn't been feeling well. Then Dad wouldn't let me see him for a few days. He sent me town to pick up an Urutu snake. I guess it was a fool's errand, since the freight manager had no record of it. I stopped at the carnival on the way back to see a 'snake man' I'd heard about. It was Tim. I recognized his face! Then I knew that David was in trouble. I drove back as fast as I could, but I was too late.\" Deputy Bock scratched his head. \"So what are you telling us, ma'am? That this here cobra is David Blake?\" \"That's exactly what I'm telling you!\" Kristina's voice broke on the last words. Sheriff Hardison and the deputy exchanged a look. Hardison put his hand on Kristina's shoulder. \"Miss Stoner, you've had too much excitement for one day. You just need a good night's sleep.\" His words were kind. \"I'm sorry about your father. He was a good man. Don't you worry now. We'll take care of everything.\" He walked toward the door. \"Do you have a phone here? I need to call the coroner.\" Kristina motioned toward the house. \"In the kitchen.\" \"Thank you. Now let me take you inside.\" Kristina shook her head. \"No, thanks. I'd rather stay here for now.\" \"All right. You'll need to come into town tomorrow. We need to fill out some paperwork. David and Tim have both been reported missing.\" Kristina sighed. No use trying to explain to them. She thanked the men and walked them to their car. As she walked back toward her father's lab, the tears streamed down her cheeks. \"Why, Dad? Why?!\" she screamed into the warm summer air. Her dad, and her first love. Both gone in one day. She closed her eyes as she thought of David. Her first real boyfriend, with his bright blue eyes, winsome smile, and gentle ways. She'd fallen for him right from the start. Her father had always been a little eccentric, but experimenting on people ? \"What made you do it, Dad?\" She would never know the truth now.

Maybe you're still in there somewhere.\" Her heart hurt, and there was a lump in her throat. Mixed emotions overwhelmed her. She had always been afraid of cobras, but this was no ordinary cobra. The snake slithered closer to Kristina, and looked at her as though it understood. \"I have to believe you're still there. Some part of you is still human!\" She was certain she could feel David communicating with her. Please help me . Kristina held her breath as she gently touched the cobra's head. \"That's right, I won't hurt you. I promise I'll take care of you, David. I love you, and I always will.\" ","Summary":" \"No! David!

Il est dit de certaines entités qu'elles ne peuvent pas mourir. Et je suis l'une d'elles. Retenu prisonnier par la main de l'homme, je suis l'un de ces grimoires anciens, fortement enchaîné, recouvert de poussière et de moisissure. Un livre qui ne peut pas mourir. Je suis magique et secret. On ne peut me garder sous peine d'infortune. Du fond de ma prison de fer et de pierre, je peux encore percevoir et me manifester. L'homme qui se croit supérieur ou différent parce qu'il sent le fluide magique couler dans ses veines n'a rien d'extraordinaire. Les opérations de magies font appel à des éléments psychiques tout à fait normaux, des données inconscientes de l'âme, ou de collectif tout entier, stimulés dans l'hypnose et la suggestion. Ainsi l'Homme accède-t-il aux transformations d'envergure et aux portes de l'Autre Monde. Mais est-il prêt ?à Au-delà des pierres de taille, des insectes aveugles et des relents fétides de la terre moisie, j'éprouve de loin le contact d'un pauvre fou qui est à la recherche de l'inaccessible. Il est si loin ! J'entends à peine l'écho de ses appels à travers le temps. Et le temps est justement mon allié le plus féroce. L'homme s'imagine savoir ce qu'est le temps parce qu'il peut lire l'heure. Mais en fait, il parle du temps comme un aveugle parle des couleurs. Le temps est un phénomène mystérieux. Il ne s'écoule que dans un sens, même dans des dimensions tout à fait différentes. L'Homme a bien sûr conscience que le temps passe, mais il ne peut pas le sentir passer, car il ne possède aucun organe sensoriel ayant cette capacité. Tandis que moi… Dans l'antiquité, on se représentait le temps comme une roue. Les jours se succédaient, tout comme les saisons, puis les années. Tout finissait toujours par recommencer. J'affirme encore que le temps ne peut s'écouler que dans un sens, de façon linéaire et non cylindrique. Ce qui m'a mené à une découverte fascinante dont je ne pourrai jamais me lasser : l'expression de terreur qui se dégage du visage d'un homme sachant qu'il va mourir. Au dernier moment, les regrets l'emportent sur la peur; il sait qu'il perdra tout sans aucune possibilité de retour. Le temps constant est une illusion. Il est élastique. Il peut se contracter, se dilater, donc peut être manipulé. On a fait grand état jadis du seul homme parvenu à cette conclusion. Un natif de la Germanie. Mais malgré la justesse de sa grande théorie de la relativité, il mourra sans jamais expérimenter le pouvoir réel du temps. Ainsi vécut-il lui aussi de lourds regrets au moment de pousser son dernier souffle. Bien enserrées entre mes couvertures de cuir imputrescibles, les pages du vélin dont j'ai la garde, et qui me donnent vie, renferment le moyen d'expérimenter le temps. J'ai été conçu dans ce but unique. C'est dans le temps que réside mon pouvoir à moi ! Je suis l'un des livres qui commandent l'asservissement. Je suis l'Agrippa ! Le pauvre fou dont je peux sentir le contact et auquel je donnerai les moyens de me retrouver, me tirera bientôt de ma prison. Il viendra, j'en suis convaincu. Il livrera père et mère pour acquérir la maîtrise du temps, aussi bien pour lui seul que pour perdre des armées. Grisé par l'ambition et pour se couvrir de gloire, il voudra montrer à son prince le moyen d'écraser ses ennemis. Et je serai libre.

We all wait for you. You decent man. You and Señor Rodrigo sleep in same bed, we look other way. Pairings: Derek Bliss/Rodrigo Warnings: Spoilers for Vampires: Los Muertos . Overtones of a male/male sexual relationship. This story is not politically correct. In the canon, Sancho's mother wrote him a permission slip (still snickering over that) for him to go on Derek Bliss' vampire hunt. It was in broken English because Spanish is her first language. I have carried that over into this story. If that little slice of potential reality is going to offend you, it'd probably be better if you didn't read the story. Beta Thanks: Beta'ed by my friend Sammie. Author's Notes: They never gave Sancho a last name in the movie, so I gave him one. I also gave him a big family and a name for his mama. Similar details were filled in for Rodrigo. Written for Tigerlady in the yuletide 2009 challenge. Rodrigo began to chuckle to himself when he saw Derek in the Santa hat as he crossed their little efficiency in Laredo. Always the cynic, Derek just glared at him over the Styrofoam cooler in his arms. \"What are you laughing at?\" Rodrigo was still under the covers, wearing only boxer shorts. Lounging in bed was about all he planned to do during the week before Christmas. Watching Derek drop the cooler on the small, rickety kitchen table, he replied, \"I didn't think Santa brought his presents until Christmas Eve.\" \"Huh?\" Derek pressed a finger down on the edge of the table. It rocked once... twice... three times before he seemed to be satisfied that whatever item he had placed under the short leg was no longer doing its job. The pile of napkins had significantly deflated, or perhaps Sancho and Zoey had stolen some when they were in the apartment eating fried chicken the other day. Fried chicken... that was a napkin food for sure. \"What about Santa?\" Rodrigo, amused, rested his head on his hand and pointed to it with the other. Derek looked confused for a moment before looking up, rolling his eyes, and removing the Santa hat. He tossed it on the table. \"Zoey put it on me.\" \"She and Sancho finish their shopping yet?\" \"I guess so. You know Zoey; always remembers something just when she thinks she's done.\" He picked up several envelopes from off the top of the cooler and began to sort through them. \"Mail came. Christmas card... Christmas card... Christmas... you know, I should buy stock in Hallmark. It's a lucrative business this time of year.\" Derek tossed the unopened cards on the table like he'd done the Santa hat. Rodrigo frowned. \"Why are you always so cynical?\" Derek looked at him quizzically from under several strands of light brown hair that had fallen in his eyes. \"Isn't that just something you love about my sparkling personality?\" Rodrigo pressed him. \"It's Christmas.\" Rolling his eyes again, Derek kicked off one shoe and used his foot to work off the other. \"Zoey and Sancho didn't have enough nauseating Christmas spirit for you?\" \"They were fine. I was just hoping I could get some from you.\" \"Don't hold your breath.\" Derek came over to the bed after grabbing his box of Oaties cereal from off the top of the fridge and sat down. Although an outsider might take his words for a bad mood, Rodrigo knew him well enough to know the difference, and he ventured that it was safe to run his fingers absently along the small of Derek's back while he snacked on handfuls of Oaties and read the more important mail. \"Zoey and I got our pills,\" Derek remarked, holding up a bulky envelope. \"That's good. Things have been easier since the doctor started the mail order program.\" \"Yeah. Don't have to make the constant runs to Mexico City.\" Derek read the return address on another envelope and tore into it. \"Brody,\" he said simply. \"What does he have to say?\" \"Uh, lessee... 'Derek, Bogeys have been spotted trying to cross the border from Tijuana into Cali. Hunters there might need your help. Will keep you posted. In regards to your question, the...' \" Falling silent, Derek read the rest to himself. Rodrigo felt the lower back under his hand tense a bit. \"What is it?\" \"Nothing.\" He folded the letter and tried to put it back in its envelope. \"What did Brody have to say?\" Leaning forward, Rodrigo grabbed the corner of the letter. Derek attempted to pull it away, but the letter was still yanked out of his grasp, a little crumpled for it. He sighed, but made no effort to take the letter back. This gave Rodrigo the chance to read it. A gentle, touched smile came to his face before he started to read it aloud. \" 'In regards to your question, the general consensus is that as long as you keep taking your pills, you shouldn't have to worry about passing vampirism through sex. It isn't exactly like HIV and other STD's anyway, but it's not like anyone's ever had the chance to conduct a study. You'd have to worry more about your blood and saliva if you were fully infected. As things are now, I think you can relax.' He ends with, 'I told no one of your condition. The boys in the office thought we were having a simple philosophical discussion about the hazards of the job.' Hm.\" Rodrigo reached up, taking Derek by the back of the neck, and pulled him down for a long, lazy kiss. He could tell by the half-lidded cast of Derek's eyes that it would be well received. \"You were concerned about me?\" Derek laid down and allowed Rodrigo to kiss him several times, some long and lingering, some short but passionate, his hand cupping Rodrigo's jaw. Between kisses, he said, \"I can't let you catch this from me. You don't deserve to have to deal with the shit that I do on a daily basis.\" \"As long as you keep taking your pills, what do you have to worry about, Derek?\" With a sigh and a shrug, Derek responded, \"What happens if the pills run out.\" That gave Rodrigo slight pause. One more kiss and he said, \"Don't worry about things that may not happen. But I suppose you cannot help it.\" \"No... I can't. I have to think about it. What kind of man would I be if I didn't?\" Lying back with an arm resting under his head, Derek opened another letter one-handed. \"This one's from Sancho's mom.\" \"Is that who sent the cooler?\" \"Yeah.\" He nearly destroyed the envelope getting it open with just one hand, but finally the letter came free, and Derek was able to shake it open. While he read the letter, Rodrigo reached into the box of cereal and snacked on it in imitation of his lover. \" 'Dear Señor Bliss, I receive money you pay my son for work on last hunt. Bless you for the help. Myself and Sancho's nine brother and sister pray for you day an night. You are decent man. You take care of my son an keep from harm. He allowed to hunt with you always. I send fresh lamb for your dinner.' \" Derek looked at the cooler. \"Is that what that is?\" Rodrigo considered it, noticing the water dripping from one corner of the cooler and the condensation forming around it. \"You better get that in the fridge.\" \"Do we even dare eat it?\" He examined the shipping label from across the room. \"Looks like she overnighted it. Besides, you know Sancho will insist he at least eat it.\" With a nod, Derek continued, \" 'I know you look after my Sancho so he come home one day and marry nice girl in the Catholic church. We pray for you this Christmas. You come visit? I have daughter who fight like Sancho. She kill many vampire. We keep garlic and cross at door like you say but still they come around church, look for trouble. Our faith keep most away. Still, my Camila kill many. Maybe she hunt with you too?' \" Derek couldn't help but chuckle and shake his head. \"Soon she'll have her whole family hunting with us.\" Rodrigo nodded and laughed too. \"Is that all she has to say?\" \"No, there's a little more. 'Please bring my son home for Christmas. We all wait for you. You decent man, Señor Bliss. You and Señor Rodrigo sleep in same bed, we look other way.' What?\" Rodrigo laughed hard at that one. Derek sighed, covering his face with the letter momentarily. Then he finished it. \" 'You all invited, come home. Love, Rosa.' I'm getting the feeling she wants us to come to Mexico for the holidays...\" \"What gave you that idea?\" They snickered and shared a kiss. \"So why don't we go?\" Derek did a double take at him out of surprise. \"You want to spend Christmas with Sancho's family?\" \"Sure, why not?\" \"Because... we got a whole lamb to eat.\" He gestured to the cooler. \"There's several days for that.\" \"But I don't wanna spend Christmas listening to Rosa's sales pitch,\" Derek said with a roll of his eyes. Rodrigo couldn't help it; his face visibly fell in disappointment. \"Alright, I guess if you don't want to...\" Derek remembered Rodrigo talking about his village, how there were many relatives and how they all gathered together for the holidays and feasted for days; that was until the vampires came. How many families in that part of Mexico had suffered the same fate because of the rabid strain of vampirism that turned people there into wild animals with human faces? And then Rodrigo made a new family among the monks, men who had taken Derek in as well, gave him food and shelter... things hadn't turned out well for them either. Sancho's family was lucky to still be all together and alive, especially concerning their size. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that was due to his association with Derek Bliss and the Van Helsing Group. A large Hispanic family, full of brothers and sisters, with a spitfire for a mother... they had to remind Rodrigo of his own family. An instant after he'd seen that disappointed look on Rodrigo's face, Derek realized why he wanted to go. \"No, no. You're right. We should spend Christmas with Sancho's family.\" The light came back into Rodrigo's eyes. \"Really? What changed your mind?\" \"Well...\" Derek grinned, his own blue eyes twinkling. \"...it just wouldn't be Christmas without a big, decorated tree and little ones running everywhere, and Rosa Vera Cruz trying to squeeze money outta me.\" They both laughed. \"Next she'll try to convince you of what a great vampire hunter she is.\" That only made them laugh harder. The two men cuddled close, putting their foreheads together, and said at the same time, \"She need the money real bad.\" Two days later, the group packed up Mt. Grace and headed south, a cooler full of lamb kabobs and roasted leg of lamb in the back.

Kim Chaptern1 Schoolntrip...me and Michael are going on this trip, it sounds amazing. Thengreat outdoors... adventure at every turn, and Michael's there...nromance and moonlight and Michael's there, Michael'snthere ...oh! Sorry got a bit lost in thought there; Michael's mynboyfriend and what a boyfriend he is! His hair, his eyes as you cannimagine spectacular, his figure well...it's ok. Inmean he isn't fat but he is not skinny - he's just ok. Anyway I can'tnbelieve tomorrow we'll have thenfresh clean air, brushing against our cheeks and the cold, dampnforest, thriving with life. Inhonestly can't wait! I mean, me and nature haven't seen eye to eye innthe past, but I have hope this time. Howncan someone expect me to sleep? Injust keep thinking about Michael and the breath taking adventures wenmight be about to have. I told my bestnfriend Kayly, about all the adventures me and Michael were having innmy dream. Shensimply kissed her teeth and returned to her geography H/W, the shensaid... \" Wisenup...,\" she continues after a short pause \"he's NOT thensuperman you think he is.\" I tut then daydream some more.nEveryone is so against me being with Michael! What's their problem?nIs it any of their business? So why do they get involved? With theirn'he isn't good for you' or 'he'll hurt you!' they don't know him likenI do! He's sweet, he's kind, and he's handsome and sensitive. Wenknow each other and love each other and that's all that matters... Pgn2 It'snfinally the day!! I haven't stop talking and thinking about itnnon-stop. I wonder will our relationship get stronger or weaker afternthis he promised me stronger. I hear the crunch of pebbles under newnpumped car tyres and the ferocious roar of the engine. This eithernmeant two things my step-dad had finally brought a new car or it'snMichael!!! I rush into my bathroom and apply some quick dry,nwaterproof mascara and eyeliner, I hear footsteps approaching myndoor, and I open the bathroom door just as my mum step-dad andnMichael come through my bedroom door.(without knocking..._) \"Hi...,\"nMichael says really coolly my heart was to one side of my chest andnback again. \"Hi...,\"nI beam an embarrassed smile as he quickly grinned and winked at menwhen mum and Greg (step-dad) were fussing over my luggage. \"I'llntake those...,\" he says lifting my suitcase with no realndifficulty. \"Awwnhe's such a gentleman if only all men were like you, huh?\"Mumnadmires. Greg pulls a face at me and I giggle mischievously. \"Comenor me and Michael will be late!\" I say. I stroll beside Michaelnas we walked down the stairs, occasionally flashing a look over tonhim which, is always returned. Henloads my suitcase into the boot of his convertible Mercedes. I slideninto the front passenger seat and deeply inhale the 'new car' smell.nI love that smell I guess I'm just a freak like that. Carefully Inwind down the window and say all the 'love felt' good-byes to my mum,nstep-dad and to little may-I-say adorable sisters as they weptnferociously on mum. They hate it when I go somewhere for more than anday. \"Bye...seenyou soon! Gosh I'll be back love you!!!\" I say to my sister.nThey come over to the car and give me my final kiss goodbye. My stepndad then taps the top of the roof, that's our signal to go!! I waventhem goodbye, not knowing, really how long it'd be until I saw themnagain. Pgn3 Anfew dreary hours pass and me and Michael reach the Forest Lukkanii.nWe unload the luggage in Michael's boot, and then register at thensign in centre. We meet up with some of our mates and chat then wenare given a map by someone called Jake who if I can say so... veryncute. Finally we took off on our way to our suites yes, suites! I andnMichael stroll behind everyone on the path, holding hands and in ournown world. \" Kimnlets go,\" Michael says eagerly. \" Gonwhere?\" I cough. He stops abruptly and holds my hands. \" wellnyou wanted adventure right?\" he asks. \"Wellnyh...,\" I smile uneasily. See \"Looknat this...,\" he says as he points the map. \"We are here andnlook at the route we are taking.\" I look then look at him. \"Erm...\"nI say unsure of what I was supposed to be looking at. He laughsnlightly at me and I swoon. \"looknwe are taking the overly long route when we could cut through thenforest this way and get there early enough to choose rooms closenenough to each other.\" he says waiting for my response. Closenenough to each other for what exactly? \"Bu...,\"nMy voice trails away as I see his face.\" fine! Let's go.\" hengrins and he sneakily leads me away. We wonder deeper into the densenbushes. As we wonder I think about what's going to happen next me andnMichael swinging through the trees like Tarzan and Jane. \"Hmm...nthis is strange...,\" he mutters dragging me back to reality. \"What?\"nI say dreamily swinging my arms and enjoying the cool breeze againstnMr bare shoulders, while he stands looking at the map puzzled. \"Well...nit has a river here but on the map there isn't one...,\" he saysnfrazzled. I for one am not worried at all. \" Wellnif you don't know where we are then let's go back to the path justnfollow the way we came. \"NO!nI mean no... I know where we are.\" he says reassuringly. Henpoints at the step stones and walks towards them, I sigh and follow,ngosh boys and their ego, even this forest isn't big enough for his!nHe indicates for me to go first. I jump on the first step wobblingnfrom side to side... wow this rock is pretty soft. I step onto thennext one giggling like fool. I nearly lose my balance. I...I swearnthat rock just moved up ahead... Ohnmy gosh it DID!nSlowly I look down to where my feet are and I see scales and itsnbreathing and suddenly the scales open its eyes. I scream at the topnof my lungs and the crocodile swish's, me knocking off it and to thenworst place possible the water. I feel the water smack across my backnand a swirl or browns and blues, till I hit the bottom with antremendous force that I blackout. Pgn4 I awake with anspinning head, slowly my senses returned to me. I could feel thenroughly softness of whatever was on top of me and I could hear thentwitter of birds around and the silent whistle of the wind, as itnmeandered through the trees. I debate on whether I should sit up ornnot I decided I had to know where I am. SonI unsteadily sit up and get a better look at my surroundings. It wasnlike those story house hut things people talk about, the people whonlive in woods or something. What...what if they are barbaric? Andnthey want to eat me? Oh come on stop being stupid ....or...ornwhat if they want to make me their new tribe wife? Why am Inthinking like this? Intry to get up but it was useless! So I just sit on the bed its covernresting against me making me feel itchy. I try to walk or at leastnstand up again. I used my hands to give me a boost up, a triumph I'venstood up! Crap! My knees are swaying like London Bridge...damn! Intumble over accidentally knocking a few things over. Oh no! I cannhear the scrape of feet... I sit up to see the blondest hair I'venever seen...like hay and blue eyes that are as deep as the ocean. AsnI stare, they stare back at me. Then I notice the cheeks turn a deepnshade of red or was it pinker? But I know it is glowing. He turnsnaway...I look down to see my clothes practically hanging off me,nshowing off my blue and pink bra. I sit up straight so it didn't hangnand forced words out of me. \"Whonare you?...Why am I here? What happened?\" I say breathlessly asnif I'd just done a bleep test. I think he is still blushing and toonshy to say anything...that's why there is a short silence. He took anfew steps towards me, but I retreat, I mean I don't even know thisnguy! He looks at me with a warm slightly embarrassed smile. He holdsnout his hand... there is a long pause all that can be heard is thenwhistling wind, the twittering birds and the sound of my heart as itnpumps blood faster around my body. Finally I decide to take it. Helpsnme up very shakily and steadies me. \"I'mnLucas...,\" His crystal clear voice soothes. \"I'mnKim...what happened? Why am I here?\" I ask confused. \"Youngot attacked by a crocodile...,\" \" Huh?nWhat?... What happened to Michael?\" I ask expecting the worst. \"Michael?...Younmean the guy who ran off?\" he says. \"R....rannoff?\" The word echo's through my head no it can't be Michaelnhe...he just wouldn't do that to me... \"Yeah...hensaw it and was off like a gun.\" He says slightly seething. \"Really...but...andnyou saved me?\" I ask trying hard to remember. \"Inwouldn't say saved you, you weren't in any real danger...,\"hensighs. \"Sonlet me get this straight, a crocodile ready and hungry attacking menis no real danger??!\" I say trying hard to remember, gosh Inwouldn't like to see what he calls danger... \"Itnwas only defending itself...,\" \"Defendingnitself?\" I say in disbelief I can't believe I'm hearing this. \"Yes...nyou know you was standing on its back it was only using itsninstinct!\" he says a little rattled. Silence fills the air andnpoisons it. \"SonMichael just left...you helped me brought me here and nursednme to health?\" And here I am having a go at him... \" Yeahnbasically.\" So Michael left that's it? He just left me... tondie? Maybe he was going to get help... yeah right I'm justnkidding myself, he left me...ME...to die in the claws of a crocodile.nI snap out of my trance to see Lucas staring at me as if he wasnlistening to what I was thinking...I feel a little uneasy...andncold...no really I'm freezing...I didn't even notice I am shiveringnbut he had. \"Younwant to put on some clean, dry clothes?\" He asks. Pgn5 Intold him I am fine but he insists so I change into one of his topsnand dark baggy trousers. I stared out his window I hate to admit itnbut I was thinking of that no good idiot that ditched me...we werenmeant to have exciting adventures...beautiful romance...well there'snLucas...Lucas? Yeah right he must think I'm a bloody retard gettingnditched like that. \"Younok?\" he says \"Yeahnwhy?\" I reply defensively, although I don't know what I amndefending. \"Don'tnknow...you just...,\"he stops and takes out tobacco papernfor...tah dah wrapping tobacco in it. He takes great care in wrappingnthe right amount of tobacco and licking the paperthen finallynlighting it with a match... when he saw my curious face he silentlynlaughs and says... \"Nevernseen anyone smoke before?\" he teases me and it working. I rollnmy eyes ... he draws. \"Ofncourse! I'm not stupid!\" I say annoyed \"Didn'tnsay you were...,\" I finally understanding what he was saying. \"nI wasn't staring at you...I...I was just... staring past you at thatnpicture someone's drawn...as a artist myself I take great interestnin other artists work!\" He raises his eyebrows and blows out. \" Indrew it that's the river... I draw when I'm bored...,\" \"Sonwhat are you?\" I ask \"Anboy...human... a teenager...,\" He says looking slightlynconfused. \"NonI'm meant are you a traveller?\" I say in a patronizing way \"No,nI live here.\" \"Bynyourself? You must be lonely, well now you have some company for anwhile.\" Hengrins. I don't know whether he was laughing at the thought of me ornat me. \"You'reneyes are deep blue you know...yeah... you probably do know, stupidnquestion...,\" \"Whatndo you think they look like?\" They look like whirlpools of thenshimmering deep blue sea, they look beautiful. But I can't really saynthat can I? He probably doesn't know what the sea looks like! \" Ifnyou have ever seen the sea then you'll know what I'm talkingnabout...,\" I say \" Tellnme what you think...,\" I try reading whether he's joking ornserious but his facial expressions were as blank as my history book. \"Theynlook like blue Sapphires they're very rare and beautiful...,\"nCrap...he probably thinks I'm a freak...I place my hands over mynface. Completely and utterly embarrassed. He takes my hands away fromnmy face, holding up my chin, his hands are so soft, caressing has antinge of an earthy smell to them. \"Letnme see yours...dark as the night sky... but as fresh as the soil andnas deep as the 'deep blue sea' ...as appealing as a diamond...,\"nhe says...a big grin crawls across his face...what this??!! I'mnmelting like chocolate! Because he's holding my cheek still... Innever got such a rush from Michael... so why him? I don't know him... \"W...wh...Whenna...are you...err going to take me...back?\" \" Indon't know where you're camping out...,\" \"So...wherenam I going?\" Pgn6 \"Youncan stay here...,\" \"Really?\"nhe shrugs his shoulders like it was no big deal. It was to me...anvery big deal. \"T...thanks...yournbeing a real good friend to a stranger...,\"I hugged him henstiffens up then relaxed and enjoyed the company of someone huggingnhim. Is it wrong to think about more than hugging a completenstranger? I hope it isn't because it's how I feel. I slowly stoppednhugging him and looked into his eyes; it is like looking at magic, sonunpredictable, beautiful...fascinating...the curiosity or the mindnwandering...what's behind those eyes? What's he thinking? Is henthinking of a person? If so who? A voice rose slightly above thenothers and said, me...maybenit's me ? I thinknI'm starting to like him in the most peculiar way... Pgn7 CHAPTERS 2 Itsnmorning and the sweet smell of tobacco swooned in the air but, itndidn't hang like an odour it...it's... I don't know it's hard tonexplain. I liked the smell for some reason; I groaned and sat up...nseeing he wasn't inside here... I stood up and saw a note on thentable saying... GonenFishing Back soon won't take long.... Lucas Oh...sonI'm here alone?... again? Right don't panic, calm down, I startednwalking around the home and I touched his table it has engravednflowers, twines and extremely delicate. I hadn't even noticed thendoor had opened until someone grabbed my hand... \"Whonare you?\" She asked her eyes narrowing with suspition \"Whonare you?\" I say. \"I'llnhave you killed trespasser!\" she growled at me. \"Trespasser?...butnLucas kind of...\" \"What?\"nShe scrunched up her face. \"Who are you?\" \"I'm...I'mnKim..,\" \"Well...Kim!\"nShe says with complete disgust! \" Get out of my futurenboyfriends house!\" \"But..,\"nShe gets out spear. I side step with my hands up by my head andnslowly backed out of the house thingy... I banged into something tonmy surprise it wasn't Lucas. Henswung me around and then looks me over in Lucas' clothes, his T-shirtnhanging off my frame and his baggy jeans even baggier on me. He putsnhe's hand out. \"HinI'm Karlac... you must be Kim... Lucas told me you'd be here...hentold me to keep an eye on you...Taya?...Why have you got a spear tonher head?\" \"Inthought she was a trespasser...Lucas hasn't told me yet...,\"nKarlac shook his head. Thank you Lord, Thank you!!! Karlacnhustled us back in. I was still pretty confused but at least no-onenwas sticking spears to my neck...Who are these people to Lucas?nBrother? Cousin? Friends? Lover? If they're here are there others? Whatndid she mean I'll have you killed? They're must be others! I thinknTaya fancies Lucas, that's awkward. \"Hownmuch years do you have?\" Karlac asks. \"Excusenme?...oh! How old am I? Oh I'm 15..,\" I saw an embarrassed smilencreep across his face. But his eyes were disappointed...he's quitenmuscular...I guess my type...not as much as...he was. \"So...arenyou like Lucas' Girlfriend or something?\" \"No...Justnclose friends...,\" says the girl. \"But-,\" \"Mynnames Taya...if you didn't know..,\" This girl is dodgy, I'llnhave to watch out with her...she reminded me of Angela...So if he isnher boyfriend then I understand why she is so protective over him. Pagen8 Inturned to karlac as I was fed up with talking to her. Shenstared at the door...probably hoping Lucas would come in, kick me outnand confess his undying love for her. Before I could stop myself Inblurted out... \"Younmust really like him..,\" \"Hmm...Me...No...We'renjust friends..,\" She went all pink it's a good thing Lucas camenin because I wouldn't have been responsible for my words. He stoodnstaring for a while then put down his bag. \"Hineveryone...,\" I smile and then go back into my solemn face Tayanis looking away from him with an embarrassing look glowing cheeks, anwarm smile...looking at the floor. It was certain she had a crush...nI know because that's how I used to be like...But I'm so over allnthat...I hope. \"I'mnhungry..,\" says Karlac. \"Yeah...breakfastnis on the fire in a minute,\" says Lucas. \"I'llnhelp..,\"says Taya with a nod. They start cooking somethingnup...together...makes me feel sick really, it's not like he wasntaking any notice of her. I rolled my eyes back to Karlac. \"Yeah...I'dnlove to take a look and maybe this time not a spear in sight!\" Insay bitterly. I looked at Lucas I could tell he was about to objectnbut closed his mouth again. Me and Karlac walk outside it was warm,nand the leaves on the trees turned light green, in the summernsun...it is so peaceful nothing like the busy streets of Greenlandntown. Everyonenbustling about like they have somewhere to go? But even so...I Missnis Greenland town... the one place I thought I was happy to get ridnof! I looked back and saw Lucas staring back at me...blankly likenlast time, a trace of smile crossed his face...then he, turned away,nembarrassed. Karlac was nattering on about the birds and the trees,nbut for some odd reason all I could think about was that smile... itnwas so warm, so right... so beautiful. Now I knew why Taya acts likena love struck zombie! \"Let'sngo back in..,\" Karlac says \"Why?nLet's walk a bit more..,\" \"Nahnthis is enough..,\" \"But..,\" \"Letsngo..,\" So very confused, I followed him back and sat outside bynmyself, as he went in to speak to Lucas and Taya privately...I hatednbeing left out it wasn't fair. Justnas I was thinking that Lucas came out and sat beside me nervously. \"Didnyou have a nice cosy little chat bout me then?\" \"Itnwasn't like that..,\" he remarks, he looked hurt and guilty and Infelt terrible. \" Whatnwould we gain from that?\" \"Indon't know.\" I saw at the corner of my eye, karlac at thenwindow. Why are they spying on us? What the hell is going on?? Maybenthey are going to eat me!!.. B...but Lucas would never... \"What'sngoing on?.. It's not the first time I've been suspicious! A...arenare you going to eat me??!?\" I say blurting out my idiocy. Henchokes with laughter. \" Eatnyou? What do you think we are? Savages?\" I smile to myself aboutnhow stupid I must sound. Silencenloomed for a second. \" Whatndo you think of Karlac?\" It looked like he hated all he was saying. \" Why?\" \" Because...Henasked me to ask you if you err...liked him..,\" Inwasn't really shocked, but the way that Lucas hadn't looked me in thenface once, I was thinking...kind of hoping he was going to saynsomething else. \" Intell you after you answer a few questions... truthfully..,\" \"Ok...ask,\"nHe said calmly staring at the floor. \"Whatndo you think of Taya..?\" \"Taya?...nShe's my friend..,\" This time he looks at me confused. \"You'renblind...that girls really likes you... she's always looking at younembarrassed, heck! Even when I first saw her she made me know yournher property..,\" He looked so innocent...yet...blank. I lookedndead seriously at him...he was reading my facial expression. I keepnon staring at him it makes me feel funny. I mean here's a handsomenguy staring at me for whatever reason, it was a little unnerving...hennoticed he was staring and the look of curiosity, on my face andnblushed. I smiled. \"So...ndo you like her?\" I say breaking the uncomfortable silence. \"Younwon't tell her? - Of course you won't,\" still blushing, hencontinues\" Not really...I mean we're good friends... but... I don'tnknow...nothing more.\" I must admit I was a little surprised Inexpect him to say No... I mean yes... I mean I don't know! He carriednon... \"Plusnin our culture you have to be the same age as the other person... I'mn16 she's 17. To be honest if she asked that would be my onlynexcuse..,\" \"Hownold is karlac?\" I say eagerly. \"17,\" \"Yes!nI mean...Oh, too bad.\" \"Youndon't like him do you?\" I admitted and said 'No', just as Tayanand Karlac came and sat with us. Pagen9 \" Sonwhat did you guys talk about?\" Says Karlac \" Intalked about Greenland, how pretty it is at times, but not as prettynas here...here is much warmer!\" \" Greenlandnhuh?\"Karlac says flashing a look at Lucas, but he wasn't looking atnhim he was looking at the light blue sky, contrasting his deep blueneyes. And Taya was staring at me giving me a suspicious look. \" KimnI..,\" \" Lucasnwhere is my clothes and stuff?\" \" Outnback..,\" He says airily still looking up. \" I'mngoing to go change.\" \"Greatnmaybe we can have a chance to get to know each other!\" Says Tayaneagerly, a bit too eagerly. Infollow her around the back with annI-don't-really-want-to-get-to-know-you look on. I felt verynuncomfortable dressing in front of her I felt like a porn model! \"Younknow Karlac really likes you, I think you should give him a try...\"nShe says looking at the point of the spear. \"Isnthat... a thre...never mind... you know what I think? You should mindnyour own business and worry about your own love-life!\" \"What'snthat supposed to mean?\" \"Itnfunny the way you look at Lucas... anyway we are talking about younand Karlac..,\" \"Therenis no me and Karlac or..,\" I was getting angry now...if she wasntrying to force me into it she was doing a bad job of it! Whondoes she think she think she is forcing a British citizen to donsomething they don't want to. \"You'rensaying about how -I- fancy him well WHAT ABOUT YOU?\" \"Indon't know him!\" \"Comenon the way you two are when you're with each other your alwaysnblushing and looking at him... so don't tell me about who -I- like ornyou and me will end up falling out...\" \"Andnyou think you can threaten an English citizen?\" \"Indon't know, lets see...Karlac deserves a nice girl you know,\"nshe hints. \"Sonthen why don't you go out with him... oh I know because you're notnnice! Well you know Lucas needs a nice girl too!\" I say sourly. OncenI'd put my trousers on, I walked back around to the front and keptnwalking... I could hear Lucas saying to Taya 'what did you say tonher?' for some reason it made me run faster, I didn't know where Inwas going or how this was going to help me. AsnI got further and further away, I came across a river and decided tongo for a swim to cool me of. (And to stop me from panicking). SonI took off my clothes (of course I still have my bra and knickersnon!) As I walked in the calm, still water I was relived that itnwasn't as cold as I thought it'd be. The water took shape around mynthighs as it engulfed all underneath it. I closed my eyes andnimagined I was back in Greenland on Dawnty beach and I was in thenwater enjoying the sun...I ignored all the sounds of the forest andnreplaced them with sounds of laughter and chatter...I listened in onnone of the conversations, between a young child and it's mother, itnwas relaxing being where you know. \"Therenyou are!\" I snapped back into reality so fast, I had whiplash.nThe cold, dark, damp, forest was a cruel sight to be surrounded by,ndepression swarmed me, plus out of all people to find me Lucas!nLucas!! \"Youncoming out?\" he asked. \"No!\"nI replied defiantly, it's not fair why couldn't I have had thisnmoment to myself? \"Go away!\" \"Younknow...err... don't panic but there are leeches in there!\"nWhat!! I splashed out and ran straight into his arms, you see... I'vennever ever had any kind of icky snail, slug - basically anythingnslimy on me!!! So this is like a major shock. \"Getn'em off!! Get 'em off!!!\" I scream. \" Holdnstill. Sit on that trunk and don't look,\" I do as I'm told andnturn my head away. I can feel him taking them off...It stings anlittle bit. But his hands are so soft it eases the pain. Once he hasnthem all off he rubbs my legs to comfort me. I still have my headnturned. \"Arenthey all gone? Even so I can't see 'em on the ground?\" I squirmnat the thought. \" Yeah...\"nI slowly turn my head towards him... and a sigh of relief runsnthrough my tense body...I'm o.k. . . .I'm Fine...I am never everndoing that again!! \"Howndid you find me?\" \"Hadna hunch...\" \" Gladnyou did, I don't know what I would have done if I had actually seennthem..,\" \" Arenyou coming back with me?\" \" YeahnI think I've had enough of the great outdoors for one day don'tnyou?\" \" Yeahnguess..,\" I put my clothes on and me and him, start on our waynback. Slowly strolling and not talking. I stopped walking. \" Younknow did I actually say thank you for everything?\" \" It'sno.k. I know you're thankful.\" He smiles \" Wellnthanks anyway…\" Andnthen simultaneously I kissed him on his sweet, earthy smelling skin,nwith a hint of tobacco. He went bright red and I could see he wasntrying to hold down a smile, you don't think he erm… you knownlikes me? As I was thinking this asking all these questions, I didn'tnnotice his face getting closer and closer to my face. Pagen10 Onlynuntil his lips touch mine did I snap out of my trance. His lips tastenof sweet tobacco and they are soft and feel so right on my lips… Incan't help feeling a fiery buzz rolling up inside of me, everythingnturns to jelly. I feel like a kid who has a crush on a teacher. Butnthe whole moment is ruined by someone shouting out for me… Lucasnshot off of me like a bullet. I can't believe –she- had to be thenone to spoil the moment. I don't know about me, but Lucas has anguilty look on his face it soon changes to a fake smile. Even so Indidn't look happy to see her because she defiantly will have knownnsomething's up. \" Hi…I'mnsorry for making you run off like that… was it something Insaid….Kimmy?\" She smirks. \" Don'tncall me that!\" She rolls her eyes. \" I'mnso happy we found you… you wouldn't have lasted a day withoutnus!\" I simply smiled. \" It'sna good thing Lucas was here to rescue me from certain death huh?\"nThe smirk wiped off her face and was replaced by a slightly murderousnlook. I regarded her, and then simultaneously we started walking. Inwalked behind while Taya dragged Lucas in front being clingy andnannoying. Pffftt what a freak... what a super freak. Oncenwe found our way back breakfast/ lunch was on the table butnunfortunately there wasn't enough space for me Lucas offered to sitnoutside, but I told him I wanted to sit outside so he let me.nAlthough, he didn't look too happy about it. I ate quietly as therenwas no-one to talk to... Then I put my plate down, I felt a bitntired, and cold, but most of all lonely. \" Arenyou cold?\" \" Yeah…\"nmy voice trailed off, as it was Karlac. \" I'mnnot really in the mood for talking…\" I said knowing what wasncoming next. \" Oh\"nhe says letting the silence settle again. \"That was quite a shocknto see you run off like that!\" \" Hmm…\"nI agreed \" Kim,\" \" LikenI said not in the mood-\" \" KimnI really like you.., there I said it,\" He sighed I wasn'tnshocked…o.k. o.k. I was even though I expected it. \" O.k.nthis is very awkward..,\" Please someone Lucas… damn even Tayancome please! Just then the door opened then shut again… \" So...\" \" So?\"nI sigh \" Howndo you feel?\" \" Aboutnwho?\" \" Lucas!nMe of course!\" he says sarcastically. Inthink… well you're a nice guy, and you'd be a good boyfriend-\" \" Really?nY-'\" \" But…nbut it's against my religion to be with someone who's older thannme..,\" \" Oh…nbut our love should be more important than that!\" I felt likenlaughing, important? Love? I hardly know the guy! \" I'mnsorry I'm very religious… you understand don't you..,\" BeforenI knew it he was leaning towards me, I put out a hand to stop him butnhe grabbed it and held it down, so I did what any girl would do. Inslapped him around the face. And got up. \" Whatndo you think you're doing?\" \" whatnI thought this was what you wanted!\" \" whatnI put y hand out!\" ","Summary":" Yournworld and mine.

As usual when on assignment, he wore dark brown slacks and a freshly pressed white shirt. Reaching back into the car, he snagged the matching jacket and shrugged into it. Five steps carried the veteran policeman within arm length of a uniformed office at least ten years Anderson's junior. \"Officer,\" Anderson started. The young man snapped to attention and lowered the pad he had been scribbling notes on to his side. \"Thomas, sir,\" the officer finished. Anderson gave his colleague a quick assessment. In contrast to the deep creases on Anderson's forehead, Thomas had the youthful appearance of a high school senior that had yet to be aged by the demands of their profession as Anderson had. The clean cut man was lean, with sharp features and would not be out of place in a room full of underwear models. \"This him?\" inquired Anderson with a subtle tilt of his head. \"Affirmative,\" the junior officer replied. \"Says his name is Jimmy Lane.\" Anderson nodded and approached the man. Still seated on the curb, Jimmy Lane looked up and caught Anderson's gaze. \"Detective Anderson?\" \"At your service. I've been told you have a statement to make.\" \"The flying man told me confession was good for the soul, so I want to turn myself in.\" Fifteen minutes later on the traffic choked streets of downtown Atlanta, the four occupants of a black SUV tried to distract their collective attention from their surroundings. Kyle Jordan was a beefy man, the sort of guy that was not embarrassed to take off his shirt after a hard day's work, but would never grace the cover of a muscle magazine. His black hair was thick and naturally curly and at his girlfriend's insistence, he often allowed a bang to hang just above his eye. She liked it and he would do anything for her; which was why he had been sitting in traffic day dreaming about cartoon characters he would draw once he got home from tonight's high paying fare. He smiled as the theater of his mind depicted his protagonist dead panning a clichéd tough guy line while dressed as a clown. Jordan's client for the evening, Brian Reid, was seated comfortably in the backseat. Reid was the picture of financial power. Lean and fit from tri-weekly sessions of tennis and a personal chef, he had a sharp, angular profile with what seemed like a permanent five o'clock shadow that that many women found irresistible. He was the Chief Financial Officer for a healthcare conglomerate headquartered in a fourteen story building in the heart of the city and flaunted the company's success at every opportunity. Tonight his black cotton linen blazer, pleated pants, and oxfords retailed at three thousand dollars and it was one of his less expensive ensembles. To Reid's right sat Sonia Sadler. The thirty-four year old woman was his personal assistant and kept all his affairs in order. If pressed, Reid would confess to being attracted to the woman. She had corn silk blonde hair that he realized he had never seen out of its neat ponytail. She was a slight woman, and more than one man had joked about her being carried off by a strong wind. Her green eyes were her best feature by far in his mind. Reid had nearly drowned in those eyes before and tonight he swore he had glimpsed jealousy glide over the emerald pools when he revealed his plans to treat the aspiring singer at his left to dinner. Sonia ignored him and occupied her time talking in hushed tones on her cell phone. The painfully skinny singer, Jasmine Young prattled about some insignificant teenage drama then quickly steered the mostly one-sided discussion towards which celebrities they might encounter at the restaurant. \"For you,\" Sonia said, holding out a second cell phone he had not noticed. She had painted her nails a salmon color, which he had always found a pleasant shade. He grabbed the phone and listened a few moments. \"Can it be traced back to me?\" Blue LED light shined on Casey Kent's face. An instant later, he was awake, clutching his head as if someone had detonated a bomb inside his head. The sudden, violent movement of his awakening also disrupted the slumber of his companion Delicia Barber. Delicia was a delicious shade of dark caramel, and he constantly threatened to nibble on her. She moaned; her body innately aware that it would not achieve a sleep as deep as the one that had abruptly ended until after work. Her hand groped his thigh and Casey quickly placed a hand on top of it as his other fumbled blindly for the device. Drawn by the warmth of his body, Delicia scooted towards him and rested her head in his lap. He held the pager over his head and sighed at the number shining insistently at him. Gently, he lifted her head from his lap and swung his legs off the side of the bed. \"Where ya going?\" she asked groggily, a roaming hand again groping for some part of his body and finding nothing. Casey was on the floor kneeling and reached back to grab her hand. \"Duty calls.\" He kissed the knuckle of her index finger. \"Couldn't someone else go?\" \"They need the best,\" he replied. A smile tugged at his lips at the sound of her adorable sleepy voice and gave her hand a quick squeeze. \"I'll pick you up from work later.\" An hour later, Detective Anderson stood outside of his best friend's apartment rehearsing how he was going to ask the man a very odd question. By the time the other man answered the door, Anderson dropped all pretenses and went with the direct approach. \"Did you get your superpowers back?\" \"Good evening to you too Mike. Come in.\" Jefferson Reed stepped aside and let his friend of over twenty years enter his home. \"What's going on Mike?\" \"That's what I'm trying to figure out. An hour ago, I got a guy to confess all sorts of things because a flying man told him to. In twenty years, I've only known a couple of people that could pull that off. So, Jeff, did you get your powers back?\" stood \"Not saying it wouldn't be fun for a bit, but no, I'm not your guy. Besides, I hated flying, remember.\" \"If I recall correctly, you were scared of heights.\" \"Semantics. You weren't exactly lining up to do again after that time at the mall. Whatever happened to that reporter you were trying to impress?\" \"She got married to some billionaire, divorced him and split his bucks.\" \"Good thing that never went anywhere. So, DC's has a new flying man. Interesting timing.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"In two days, it's Community Garden Fest.\" \"Dang, already? Can't believe I almost forgot.\" \"Twenty years ago. Where does the time go?\" \"I know. We were just a couple of kids, back then.\" \"No, I was a kid; you two were grown ass men.\" Both men turned in the direction of Aisha Reed's voice. The stunning thirty year old stood in the doorway that separated living from kitchen holding two large glasses of lemonade. \"Aisha, you know I want you so bad…\" \"Remind me to tell Grace you said that.\" \"How ya doing kiddo?\" Mike stood up and hugged the younger woman tightly after she handed the glasses to Jefferson. \"I was doing just fine until you came bustin' in my house like the police. What did my husband do?\" \"How do you know this is about him?\" \"Please, I'm a good girl. I've heard the stories about you two.\" \"All in the past, I assure you love of my life. Mike's just here to accuse me of vigilantism. Don't you just hate profiling?\" \"2013 and I still have a hard time hailing a cab.\" Aisha fell into Jefferson's lap then took his glass from him. \"Jeff, you know I have to cover my bases. Even if you were moonlighting as a suntan superman, it's not like I'd bust my own friend. I just wanted to check. Those were some crazy times, potna.\" \"Yeah, they were. But the past is the past.\" Across town, Darlene Smith painfully dragged her body along the small area of carpeting outside of her apartment that had yet to burst into flames. If her leg was not broken, it may as well have been for all the usefulness it offered. Tears streamed down her face as smoke stung her eyes and the possibility of her death was becoming more inevitable. A violent cough shook Darlene's entire body and halted her progress. The sharp pain of her leg injury grew even less tolerable and she just wanted it to stop. Through blurred vision, she glimpsed what she imagined to be a pair of boots approaching her. In the time it took her to blink again, she had been lifted from the ground by a pair of powerful arms. \"You'll be okay,\" a voice, obviously belonging to her rescuer, assured her. The next thing she felt was a weightless sensation, as if she were flying. A moment later she tried to pierce the veil of her blurred vision once more but could discern nothing. The scream of a siren was the second most comforting sound she had heard that night. Even as she tried to sit up, a pair of EMTs offered their assistance. One of them strapped an oxygen mask over her face and instructed her to breathe slowly. She coughed several times, expelling the smoke from her lungs. Darlene blinked back several tears and managed to see other EMTs attending to several other people she had not noticed. From another rooftop, Jamaal Mitchell watched as the firemen combated what remained of the fire. \"Good old fashioned heroics,\" a voice behind him remarked. Jamaal turned to face the voice, bewilderment etched on his face. \"How…\" \"Did I get the drop on you?\" finished the slightly older man standing before him. His black hair was neatly trimmed and combed back. He wore black jeans, a hunter green sleeveless shirt and black boots. \"Yeah,\" Jamaal confessed, curiosity getting the better of him. \"It's a gift. So, judging by how shocked you are to see me floating her, I'm guessing you don't know what's going on right now?\" \"I can honestly say, that I don't.\" \"Don't worry about it, that's why they pay me the big bucks.\" The man reached into his pocket and retrieved a card. \"So this is how this works. You talk to the guy at this address, if you like what he has to say, fine. If not, you walk away. Either way, welcome to the club, Meteor Man.\" ","Summary":" METEOR MAN 2.0 Detective Michael Anderson dragged his fingers through curly black hair as he steppe"},{"Movie":"Unknown","Title":"Renesmee Story","Author":"london gal","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5190319","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Itnwas a long ride back to Grandad Charlie and Debbie's house. Itnwas going to be a long week, first the engagement party and then thenwedding. Charlie seemed pretty peaceful in the car he didn't reallyntalk, well that wasn't unusual, I seemed to talk enough for both ofnus and he just nodded and smiled during the conversation. Finallynwe were there, the house smelled familiar and Debbie's smell wasnstrong with her extra strong perfume and her big, big smile, Incringed at the thought of her bear hugs. Thatnnight after saying hello, and unpacking I went to bed, though Inwasn't tired as I only need so much sleep in 2 days. So I just ladenthere bored as hell, singing the alphabet the only worse case wouldnbe if Charlie and Debbie started making out or something now thatnwould be bad. It was about 1am when I heard it the howl of a wolfnechoed through the air, making goosebumps stand up on my arm. Was itnhim? Well we were so near to La Push I wouldn't be surprised. Inhadn't seen Jacob since I was 5 I was now 18, though I stoppedngrowing last year. He left when he felt it would be easier to go awaynand see me when I was old enough to be able to date, which I guessnwould be now at this age, but I didn't care really I had cried enoughntears over that dog to many. My anger overpowered me and I ran a longnloud snarl. Thatnmorning the air was damp and fresh, I went out early I didn't reallynfancy wedding talk, I had a whole week of that ahead of me. Instead Inran to the beach enjoying the breeze against my face. Suddenly Insmelt the sea salt ahead of me and stopped. The water was cold on mynfeet and I decided to go for a dip, the water was so fresh thenperfect wake up. That's when I heard it again the loud howl comingnfrom the forest, I heard something running fast in my direction. Indived under the water and waited, it was lucky I didn't have tonbreath. When I felt alone again I came up to the surface the sky hadnbecome grey and it was raining. I walked slowly to the beach stayingnalert, I got dressed and ran back to Charlie and Debbie's. The housenwas empty and there was a note saying GONEnTO LA PUSH AT BILLY'S HOUSE, MEET ME THERE. CHARLIE. Inwent upstairs and got dried off, fresh change of clothes. Then I madenmy way to la Push, I hope the whole imprinting rule still counted andnI wouldn't need to start a fight with a wolf. I approached the doornand did a strong knock, omg what if Jacob answers the door there's nonway I could keep away from him, to my relief Billy answered the doornwith a look, I would have imagined from a vampire hating werewolfnfan. Then I heard Charlie call from the sitting room and I walkednstraight in with my cocky attitude, sometimes it was the only way. Charlienwas on the couch watching the game as always, Billy wheeled himselfnin and settled next to Charlie. I sat down on the large chair in thencorner, but I soon regretted it, this was obviously Jacobs chair itnhad his reach beautiful smell covered all over it, Jesus Renesmeensnap out of it. I looked straight at Billy sensing he was staring atnme, he looked away fast. That's when I decided to say something, itnwas just me I hated not talking for to long, my mouth needed to movento keep me happy. Menand Billy had a long and interesting conversation, well when I say menand Billy had a conversation I kinda just mean me. My mouth keptnmoving until Charlie said it was time to leave. JacobnPv: Inhad just come home about 1am, my house smelt different I recognisednCharlie scent but there was something else it was stronger inside,nand on my chair. Billy came round the corner. \"HeynJake\" He said \"HinDad\" I replied \" Hownwas your day\" He asked with a weird expression \"Fine,ner Dad what's with the weird smell around here??\" Billynstood quiet for a minute then said \"WellnCharlie came over here today, and Renesmee\" he said with an edge tonhis voice. Injust nodded once, trying to let the name sink in. Her scent hadnchanged since I had last seen her it smelled stronger and lovely. Inpictured her cute face and chubby cheeks, with her long curls andncheeky smile from the last time I had set eyes on my soul mate. Inwondered if she had changed. \"whatnwas she like?\" I asked eyes still closed. Itnwas silent. \"Shencan talk, I tell you that\" Billy said Insmiled. Thatnmorning it was raining and there was a chill In the air. The housenstill had that lovely scent, but it was fading. I was driving myselfncrazy searching for a strong spot of her scent. I stepped out thendoor and grabbed his wheelchair from the car and we headed of tonlunch. Whennwe got to the restaurant, I could smell the scent strong again, Intook an deep breath in and we entered the Restaurant. \"HeynBilly, Jacob over here\" \"HeynCharlie\" Billy replied Inturned round and Billy was already wheeling himself over to Charlienand getting a seat. I walked over and took a seat too. \"Where'snRenesmee\" Billy asked \"gettingna drink\" Charlie said pointing to the counter. Therenwas a tall slim figure walking over to us with her hair over hernface, the scent was so strong and beautiful, when she spotted Billynshe smiled. \"HeynBilly\" she said walking over. Thennshe spotted me, and her face turned into a shock to a forced smile. \"Hey\"nshe very simply said to me and then sat down very quickly next tonCharlie sipping on her drink though I new she wasn't enjoying it.

He just looked up at me a grind that ridiculous…dimpled grin before poking me again. I rolled my eyes and turned my attention back to the manager talking. He was talking about some kind of video shoot the boys had coming up today at the beach or next week…. or something. I really should've been paying attention. Stupid Shannon…he knows exactly what buttons to push with me to get me wound up. \"Lucy\" He whispered over my shoulder making me shiver. \"What's wrong?\" \"Shh! Pay attention.\" I mumbled. He has that shortest attention span in the history of attention spans, I swear. \"Fine…I'll get it out of you later.\" \"No you won't\" I growled \"Sure I will, I always do\" He whispered, giving me that look...that look he gives me that turns me inside out and upside down. Ha! That's what he thinks, I may compulsively tell him everything but this is one thing he doesn't need to know. \"Ohhhh my god. Would you two shut up already? Some of us are trying to pay attention.\" Jared groaned from across the room on the couch. Shannon caught my eye again and made a face. The one where he raises his eye brows and a tiny little sinister smile creeps out. The one that always makes me smile. How will I ever get over him when he's so….wonderful? I met Shaina at Beanie's for lunch, she's probably the greatest friend a girl could ask for. She's somehow found the perfect balance between no-nonsense-tell-it-like-it-is and party-girl. \"Oh god, you look terrible\" She greeted me. Every week for the past two months we'd been meeting at Beanie's for coffee and planning her impending wedding to the Leo Andretti, male model extraordinaire. With the wedding being two weeks away, She was getting pretty stressed out. Which made her a little more, shall we say honest, then she otherwise would be. \"Thanks, yeah we had a meeting with Tobias today and you know how he likes to do things early…very early. Speaking of which, I have to go at 1, we're going to do some shoots at the beach.\" \"Ok, well, don't forget tomorrow you said you'd go with me to pick up our dressed.\" She took a big gulp of her black coffee and sighed. \"So, guess what? Never mind, you'll won't guess, yesterday I hit a bird with my car…er….the bird flew into my window depending on how you look at it. It was really scary, and I'm not gonna lie, I cried al little bit\" \"That's funny cause Shannon was just saying how..\" \"NO!\" Shaina interrupted \"No no no, we made a deal, I don't have to put up with you talking about him all the time until you tell him how you feel\" I frowned. That's never gonna happen and I'm just bursting with little Shannon anecdotes. \"Shay, noooo\" I moaned \"Then I'll loose him as a friend too…\" \"Ok, let me explain it to you one more time, he like you, he oozes with desire whenever he's around you, you just refuse to see it! I don't know why but you do. And another thing, this is the 21st century, girls are the ones making the 1st move now.\" \"Yeah but..I…but…but\" \"ok well, I have an appointment to get my nails done, but listen you tell Shannno you like him before my wedding or…you're not going to be in the bridal party\" \"What? Are you insane? I already paid for my dress!\" \"Life's tough isn't it? Anyway I'll see you at the gym on Friday right?\" And then she was gone, leaving me dazed and annoyed. Sometimes it seems that everyone I know is a lunatic. \"Lucy!\" Jared screamed when he saw me walking toward the set with my makeup boxes. \"Ah. Been drinking too much Red bull huh?\" I teased him as he ran over to help me with my supplies. \"Yessss always. You're late Lucy, shame shame shame on you Lucy\" \"Miss Worth!\" Tobias, the manager/director's voice rumbled from behind a camera light. \"You're late, what do you think this is? A daycare? Well it's not, We're working on a schedule here and you need to arrive on time or don't arrive at all. If you think we're going to pay you for such irresponsible behavior you've got another thing coming\" I tried to keep my cringe from being noticeable as I waited for him to be done shouting. \"And another thing.. what kind of a make-up artist doesn't even wear makeup? You look positively average, you could at least try to spruce all of this up\" He make one flamboyant swooping gesture towards my whole body and I hung my head. \"Yo, dude\" Shannon interrupted stepping between Tobias and I \"you need to chill out, she's only 15 min late and the extra's aren't even here yet, I get that's you're stressing but don't take it out on her.\" I couldn't help smiling to myself. Because what girl doesn't love to have someone defend her honor? \"Whatever, just get to work.\" Tobias countered \"And use those same faces paints for Jared that we talked about last week\" Putting Shannon's eyeliner on always makes me crazy. For starters, I'm literally 5 inches away from mouth the whole time, and on top of that he keeps looking at me with that mischievous spark that makes his eyes appear to be laughing. It was unnerving. \"We're going to hang out here for a while after dark, start a fire, hang out, drink and make smores if you wan to stay.\" He said watching as I painted some white scales onto Jared's temple. I agreed to show up and he smile his stupid, perfect smile. I could almost hear my heart cry, it was starting to kill me staying just friends with him. Shannon was laying down in the sand on a big blanket beside me with his head at my side and a book in his hands, while the fire blazed between us and Tomo and Jared who lured the females extras to stay and go night swimming. I don't know why anyone would want to go night swimming in this freezing cold water in an ocean… at night. Seriously though, didn't anyone see Jaws I-VI? \"Oh, lucy lucy lucy, why the long face?\" Shannon asked, rubbing his eyes and yawning. \"Nothing\" \"Bull\" he said. \"Oh what do you know\" I teased sticking my tongue out at him \"About you? Plenty. All your secrets are safe with me, anyway I don't like how rarely you've been smiling lately\" \"So what?\" \"So, what's your problem?\" I was starting to get angry… \"You are my problem Shannon! My god.\" I grumbled I'm to tired to be having this conversation…things slip out when I'm tired, things I don't want to share. \"Me? What did I say something wrong?\" See there he goes, he doesn't even get mad at me for yelling at him \"Don't you know how it makes me feel when you're all…caring like this? And when I'm acting insane, like I am now, your always understanding…it's….I….UGHI can't take it.\" I sighed and glared at him \"I don't understand\" He said sitting up \" You want me to be more…mean?\" \"Nooo….I mean…I can't take it because…you're just so…freakin' wonderful and…\" I sighed letting my voice trail off \"..and I can't have you.\" \"What?\" He said, looking confused. Poor dumb boys…you have to spell everything out for them. \"I mean….\" I stopped and sighed, wishing I could change my mind and go back..but I already started, I have to finish now. \"I mean…everything you do, and say and…everything pretty much makes me want you….so much. Which is a problem because while we are friends, you're a sexy rock star surrounded by tons of sexy women, and I'm just average-y me. It's just been getting really hard for me to…be around you all the time because you're…you're just so great without even trying to be and it's unrealistic of me to think I'll ever be with you. It makes me want to beat you up sometimes. and I had to tell you because Shaina Said I couldn't be in her wedding if I didn't tell you.\" I stopped to breath for a second \"Now that I've proven my insanity, I should go.\" A dazed Shannon watched as I grabbed my bags and stood up to go. \"Don't go\" He said, grabbing a hold of my arm. I looked away, I was so close to tears as he pulled me back down to the blanket. \" Watch your hands move along my face they trace All the lines I've lived It isn't hard to love your scars 'cause that's Everywhere you've been\" \"Lucy…I…you're…I mean….we\" He stopped and just trailed his thumb along my bottom lip, sending shivers all the way down to my toes. I don't remember who moved first but the next thing I knew his mouth was pressed softly to mine. His arms wrapped around my waist pulling me onto his lap while mine were wrapped around his neck, just enjoying the taste of each other. The taste I'd been craving for so long. I didn't know what to say…or what to do so I just sat there grinning up at him for what seemed like a long time before he spoke. \"First off, you are not insane, you were just scared 'cause putting yourself out there like that is really hard.

I could feel his warm breath dancing across my collarbone. \"Are you serious? Why didn't you tell me?\" \"Lucy,\" He took my hand into his again \" I'm being real with you, I didn't…*sigh* I was going to say something to you before but then lately you'd been really distant and irritable, I thought maybe you were mad at me so I didn't.\" \"Wow…I totally never picked up on that…\" I stopped for a second to contemplate the best way to ask where we would go from here. \"Does this mean we can change our facebook statuses?\" \" i am yours and i know that you're mine you're worth waiting for you're worth waiting for be my only be my only be my only your hand in mine i swear love speeds up time and wind blows southern skies like a lullaby you're tearing down my walls your love's a wrecking ball\" Be My Only- FM Radio (AN: This song is NOT mine, I own no parts of it)[Chapter 2] '' you're the one i'll compare all the others to like sunny weather you're the one that i'll always come back to forever '' - Be my only by FM Radio \"Hey Baby\" Shannon's voice rang through my phone. \"I guess you're sleeping now but, I said I'd call when we landed in Paris so…alright, don't forget we're having dinner at Melt when I get back on Tuesday..well…that's all I guess. I miss you.\" I hit 1 to replay the message and sighed before bursting into tears again. There was a pounding on the door & Shaina's Voice carried down the hallway to my room. \"Lucy, open the door right now! We're going to be late.\" I closed my phone & crawled out of bed, wiping my eyes on the edge of the blanket before making my way down the hallway to the door. \"I can't go Shay…I can't do it.\" I called through the door trying to keep my voice steady. \"Ok, just….lucy just let me in the door. Please\" \"No, I look terrible.\" \"I don't care, I need to see you.\" I opened the door a crack to make sure she was alone before backing away and letting her in. \"Oh….

Now come on and let's get dressed and comb your hair.\" I don't know why I thought they'd really let me sit in the back, family always has to sit in the front. I don't know why these people were here, I didn't want them here. Half of the were people who were here to get pictures. People with no decency. Then there were the other honest hearted people who tried to think of the right things to say, but they couldn't find the words, they were just trying to understand what I was feeling but they couldn't possibly imagine. The moment I saw Jared enter the room I ran to him, his face mirrored mine as he embraced me tightly. Both of us just stood there, shoulders heaving with the burden of releasing pent of pent up sorrow. Just holding each other up. I was pulling laundry out of the dryer, about to get ready for our last dinner date when my phone rang \" Hello?\" \" Lu…..Lucy…...oh…god.\" Jared's cracked through the phone. \" Are you ok? Jared, what's going on?\" \" Lucy, Shannon was..\" He stopped and took some deep breaths… \" Shannon what?... Jared…Tell me, Shannon what?\" I dropped the clothes I was pulling from the dryer. \" He… there was an accident…he didn't make it…he's gone.\" I don't think I ever felt so much pain in my life, I thought it felt as if it might tear me into pieces. I had just told him the news… I rinsed my hands before running back into the bedroom to tell Shannon, I had debated letting it be a surprise for him at dinner later but I couldn't contain myself, I had to tell him now, I wanted to see his reaction. \" Shannon!\" I shouted, jumping on the bed, waking him up if he hadn't already be up. \" Whhhat?\" He groaned, not bothering to open his eyes \" Guess what!\" I squealed crawling on top of him kissing his forehead. \" Um… did Shaina have her baby already?\" \" No, but I know what we can do with that extra bed room now.\" \" Uggh. Baby it's too early for my brain to decode your subtlety, what do you mean?\" I leaned down and whispered it into his ear. That got his attention and his eyes shot wide open. \" Really?\" He asked in a whisper, \"Are you sure?\" I nodded \"I just took 3 test, I just have to go to OB/GYN and find out how far along I am.\" \" Oh my god…\" he whispered to himself \"I'm gonna be a daddy….holy…we're having a baby\" I just nodded again & kept grinning. \" Baby, you have made my day.\" He grined the devious grin of his and gave me a soft sweet kiss on the nose. \" I can't wait to tell my mom.\" I said pulling away to reach my phone and call her. \" MmMmm\" he pulled me back onto the bed and held me there next to him. \"You can call her later, I want you to myself for now. I don't have to go to the recording studio until 10.\" I was going to protest but then he pulled me into a deep driven kiss and I lost any desire to be anywhere but right there in his arms. (Which is I'm sure exactly what he wanted.) I still remember the last thing I heard him say I had just smacked him for teasing tat he was gonna put me into his phone as 'Baby Mamma\". He just grinned and kissed me goodbye, \"I love Lucy.\" Before walking out the door. And I never saw him again.

I look over at the clock; it's nearly five in the morning. I rub my eyes gently and slowly get out of bed and start maneuvering through the maze of wigs to get to the bathroom. I shut the door and sit on the toilet for a moment and put my head in my hands. I'm suddenly flooded with different feelings of dread, sadness, hurt, and regret.

I said almost arguing with myself 'He doesn't care, he's moved on.' I look at myself one last time and splash a little cool water on my face before quietly making my way back to bed. I slide back on to my side stiffly and give Yitzhak his space. I'm facing him and he is faced towards me. As I watch him sleep, I see him stir and his brows furrow before I feel a weight around my waist. He wraps his arm around me protectively; I notice he does this a lot when he sleeps. But not only when he sleeps, he's very protective of me always. I suppose I should be so lucky, lucky to have someone who wants to care for me. He pulls me closer and I feel a sense of security. I feel like I can actually sleep peacefully now, but of course that's short lived. I wake up a few hours later and notice the weight that was once wrapped around me isn't there anymore. I sit up slowly and lean back against the wall. I hear the shower running which means I have a few minutes alone. I start flipping through the channels of the TV to see if I can find him, somewhere, anywhere. I'm somewhat disappointed and relived when I can't find him on any channel. I settle for the MTV music station and throw the remote on the bed. I grab my notebook from the nightstand and begin to doodle. Shortly after, Yitzhak emerges from the bathroom. I'm looking down at my notepad, concentrated but I can feel him looking at me. \"Good morning.\" He says softly and goes about his business. I think he can feel what kind of day it's going to be. A 'don't fuck with Hedwig day', although that's most days if I'm being honest. Yitzhak doesn't know exactly what today is, but I think over the years of being together he's caught on. When I notice where my drawing is going, I slam the book closed and throw it across the room. Why was he always on my mind? Yitzhak turns around and starts to walk over towards me but I get up quickly and shut myself away in the bathroom. If I stayed, I knew I'd only do something I'd regret. I did it for the good of our relationship. Whatever's left of it that is. I decide to use this alone time to get ready. I put my makeup on, and my usual wig is sitting on the counter waiting to be switched out with my night wig. I emerge from the bathroom 45 minutes later in my full hair and makeup. I look at Yitzhak whose laying on his side of the bed listening to his cassette tape of RENT . He looks pretty content. I roll my eyes but I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm jealous that- wait a minute, me jealous of Yitzhak? I laugh to myself and shake my head to dismiss the thought and walk over to the bed. Yitzhak notices the weight shift on the bed as I take a seat and turns towards me and takes off his headphones. \"Do you want to listen with me?\" He asks. I think for a moment before shaking my head but then I really think about it. Maybe it will keep my mind off of him . I grab his hand and nod my head to let him know I change my answer. I lay myself down next to him and he puts one of his hands around my shoulder to pull me closer. We go through the album singing along to the songs together. It's the most fun we've had together in a while. Although, I do have to admit it's a bit uncomfortable. We're practically nose to nose, squeezed together because the headphones barely stretch. Yitzhak turns slightly to face me and we stare at each other for a short moment before he moves closer and I feel his lips touch mine gently. He kisses me like this when he's unsure and also maybe because he knows I'll be pissed if he smudges my lipstick but right now, I really didn't care. I let him kiss me back. We were kind of getting into it for the first time in days but then I heard the TV in the background. \"Alright, here's your number one pick, with his new single, Tommy Gnosis, The Origin of Love.\" I pull the headphone off my ear quickly. Did I hear right? I break away from Yitzhak to look at the TV, It can't be true. My eyes are fixated on the screen. I finally see him. When they zoom in on him I can see he's a little older, a little taller and more matured but to me; he's still the same 17 year old boy I met in Junction City, Kansas. I'm so concentrated on Tommy that it takes me a minute to realize he took another song from me. Yitzhak gets up and sits in front of me and also the TV to block my view. He grabs my chin and gives me another kiss, this one more heated than the ones he was giving just a minute ago. I can tell he's getting defensive. I break away and avoid his gaze. He tries to bring me back into the kiss but I grab his hand to stop him. He throws my hand away and gets up angrily. \"The fuck is wrong with you?\" I ask him. \"Why can't we-\"he stopped and took a deep breath. I don't know why he does that. Why he can't just tell me things. \"Why can't you just write a new song?!\" he asked storming out of our hotel room. I watch him leave, a small part of me thinking maybe I should go after him. I choose to let him have his space. Ever since Tommy left me I haven't been able to write a song. I would start, but they always led back to Tommy and I would get so mad and upset because all I wanted to do was forget. I just decided to stick to the songs I already had written. I did get a slight satisfaction when he tried to put out his second album and it totally flopped. Maybe that just shows he needs me too. 'I shouldn't need him, I have Yitzhak.' I sigh, getting up to go take a walk. I need to get out of this hotel room; it was starting to make me claustrophobic.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I own nothing affiliated with Hedwig the lovely JCM does 3. I hope you all are enjoying the story. I'd love to read some reviews. Anything helps :). Chapter 2 One reason why I like walking around in New York City is because I could walk around in my full attire and no one would bat an eyelash. I walk aimlessly around the city and find myself close to Time Square. I figure since I'm here, I mine as well look around. As I walk around I have to remind myself that I was supposed to be thinking of a way to fix my mistake with Yitzhak, but all I could think about was Tommy. He was all I could think about lately. It had been a few hours since I left the hotel room. I consider going back, thinking maybe Yitzhak is there but I don't think it's a good idea. I think we're just going to have a repeat of earlier. I'm tired of fighting. I sigh in exhaustion. I've been walking for hours and the only thought I can think of right this second is 'I wish I wore better shoes.' As the sun slowly begins to set, the sky turns a beautiful mixture of orange and pink tones. It makes me think of Tommy, of course. What doesn't these days? I roll my eyes in disgust for myself, but then I smile. I remember the day we had been seeing each other for six months. Tommy and I laid out on a blanket outside my trailer and we watched the sunset. I remember he told me he never bothered to watch the sunset and beside me, it was the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. I look down trying not cry and shake the memory from my head like an etch-a-sketch. As I refocus, I notice it's becoming dark quickly. I should probably head back; I don't know New York as well as I thought I did. I begin to turn around to go back when I hear a familiar tune attached to a familiar voice. Tommy? No. I close my eyes for a moment in the hopes that my mind is playing games with me. Nope, still there; and it's getting louder. I walk closer towards the sound. I see hundreds of people gathered around a tiny stage in the center of Time Square. I hope that's not who I think it is. I get a closer look. Of course it is. My mind keeps telling me just to turn around and walk back but I'm not listening. Not this time. I have mixed emotions when I see him up close. Sure, I've seen him on TV since we've broken up but never in person. I feel a sense of love and then anger. I want to hit him and then cry. I have questions that I want to ask him but never will. Without even realizing it, my body takes over and I start trying to move my way through the crowd to get as close as I can. It takes a while but I manage to push my way through the teenage mess and get only a few feet from the stage. I know I look misplaced but it feels right. It oddly feels like the old days. Tommy begins to sing his 'new' single and I can't take my eyes off of him. (Despite the fact that he's singing another one of my songs without giving me credit.) I secretly hope he catches my gaze. 'I mean I stand out pretty clear here, it would be pretty hard to miss me.' I say to myself. The more I watch him, the more the memories of us writing those songs and singing them together is almost too much for me, I think about leaving but my body won't let me. I look up one last time in the hopes that he sees me. I see him look at me finally, but quickly, and a look of panic spreads upon his face but he removes it quickly and continues with the song. When Tommy finishes the song, he turns around to lean on one of the drums in the back. No one knows what he's doing. After a few short moments of silence, Tommy turns around and returns to normal except he throws a towel at me before starting the next song. I remember when I threw my towel at him in that small café, I can't believe he'd remember to do something like that. I look back down at the towel and I furrow my brows in confusion until I see the black writing. I could recognize his scrawl anywhere. It says 'wait 4 me after.' I smile and tuck it away quickly so teenage girls don't attack me for it. I cut through the massive crowd and sit on a ledge nearby the stage. So, does that mean he wants to see me? A smile of satisfactions spreads across my face. I'm suddenly filled with some sense of happiness but what if he wants to tell me he never wants to see me again? Or – no I can't think like that. I anxiously wait around for Tommy after his show. I wait a long time, and I almost think he's not going to come. I should have guessed. When I finally grow impatient, I hop off the ledge and begin walking away. Was I really stupid enough to think he really wanted to see me? \"Hedwig? Hey!\" I hear a guy's voice call me and I turn around. There he is, only feet from me; Tommy Gnosis. My stomach flutters like a teenage girl's would when she sees her crush. I slowly walk towards him and I see him crack a smile. I smile back and we just stare at each other. I can't believe how much he's grown up since the last time I've seen him but he still acts like the same awkward teenage boy around me. Neither one of us know how to break the silence, it's almost beginning to become uncomfortable. \"I didn't know you were coming, I would have gotten you front row tickets.\" Tommy says and rubs the back of his neck. \"I didn't know either.\" I whisper and look down. \"So, how long are you in New York?\" I look up from the ground. \"A couple of days.\" I say and he smiles. \"Well, maybe we can meet up and talk or somethin'?\" My insides scream yes, but how would I ever get away from Yitzhak that long without him becoming suspicious? We'd probably have to have another fight. I sigh. \"I don't think that's such a good idea.\" I can see the disappointment on his face. I know he can see the disappointment on mine. \"Well, maybe I can just take you home then?\" I nod and follow him to his limo. It was better than nothing I guess, and it was all innocent, right? I slide into the limo and he slides in next to me. We sit in silence for a moment until he offers me a drink. I take it, thinking what's the worst that could happen? For the next hour, Tommy and I spend it drinking and singing our songs at the top of our lungs. We get closer and closer to each other with each song and the more alcohol we drink. Tommy tries to sneak a couple of kisses but I try to resist. He nips at my neck slightly before I stop him, a feeling of guilt rushing over me quickly. Why the fuck does my conscious always have to take over. I put a hand on his bare chest and close my eyes. \"I think you should actually take me home now.\" Tommy sighs and I tell him which hotel I'm staying at and the street it's on. When we finally get to my hotel the driver helps me out, but I've had so much to drink, I can barely walk. \"I'll walk you up.\" Tommy says, stumbling out of the limo. He can barely walk himself. I let him though because who knows when I'll see him again. We laugh because we know we look like fools and stumble our way through the lobby and take the elevator up to my floor. We hold on to each other and I fish the card key out of my bra. I really need to start putting pockets on my clothes. I refocus and before I can say goodbye to Tommy, he catches me by surprise and pins me up against the wall across from my door and starts kissing my neck. I try to keep silent because I don't want to give him the satisfaction but it's so hard not to like it. He grabs both my wrists and puts them slightly over my head. Apparently he's become adventurous since we've been together. \"Tommy, what-\" He cuts me off and doesn't let me finish. \"What I should have done a long time ago.\" I close my eyes to think. What is wrong with me? No more than five feet away is my husband in my hotel room and I'm right outside dry humping with my ex-lover. I feel him hold my wrist with one and hand the other slides down around my waist band. Right as I feel his hand starting to slip under the waist band, I feel a force pull him off me. I open my eyes and see Tommy stumble back and the worst thing that could have happened, Yitzhak saw. My breathing quickens and I stare at him with regretful eyes. He looks hurt; he won't even look at me now. He walks over to Tommy and just stands in front of him intensely. Tommy stands up and faces Yitzhak. He looks back at me and shakes his head before punching Tommy right across his face. I didn't even know what to do or say. Yitzhak goes back into the room before I get a chance to say anything and slams the door. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I almost forgot about Tommy. I lean down to make sure he's alright but he only backs away from me. \"Tommy?\" I shake my head in confusion. \"I'm- the drivers waiting.\" He says getting up and walking away quickly. \"Tommy!\" He leaves me standing alone in the hallway. I see him stumble to the elevator and he looks at me one last time before leaving. That sobered me up pretty quickly. I'm not sure if it's a good idea but I decide to go into the war zone, AKA our hotel room. I know it's my fault, it always is but I'm still scared to face him. When I enter the hotel room, I see Yitzhak putting his stuff in his bag. I take another deep breath gathering the courage to talk to him. \"What are you doing?\" I ask him and move to sit down on the bed. He doesn't answer me. \"You're not even going to fight with me?\" I ask. Usually that's our specialty. He starts shoving things into the bag with more force. I know I did wrong but I hate it when he ignores me. \"Will you just fucking talk to me? Say something? Do anything?!\" I stand up and move towards him. He slams the last item down and comes walking towards me. He pushes me against the wall as Tommy did and restrains my hands. He presses up against me and puts his lips on me; anywhere he can find bare skin. I know it's not supposed to but it feels pretty good. \"W-What are you doing?\" I ask him somewhat confused. I thought this was the last thing he wanted to do with me right now. \"This is what you want? Is it not?\" He says forcefully with a hint of aggression and puts his lips back on my skin. \"Sex?\" I asked him. \"Oh, that's what that was?\" he asked throwing my hands down and moving off of me. I knew he was going to start getting defensive and angry, like he usually does. \"Yitzhak, I don't know what to say.\" I see him look over at me. \"Wow that's a first.\" I slump against the wall and I see him put the last of his things in his bag, it isn't much but somehow the room looks a lot emptier without his stuff. He heads towards the door. \"Where are you going?\" I ask in a disheveled mess. \"To the other room.\" He said referring to the room where the band sleeps. He was leaving me. Only temporarily but he was leaving me, just like rest. It's my fault, I'm lucky he hasn't asked for a divorce yet. \"Okay.\" I say simply and just let him go. He goes and slams the door again behind him. This time, I wasn't sure I was actually going to be able to fix what was wrong with us.[Chapter 3] (Here's chapter 3 :). I actually really like this chapter… It's angst-y I would say so if that's your things you're in the right place. If not, don't worry. Yitzhak and Hedwig will be together again soon lol. I hope you enjoy it. As always, I own not a thing, it all goes to the amazing JCM. ) Chapter 3 It's been one week since the whole incident with Tommy. Yitzhak and I haven't said one word to each other. Or rather Yitzhak hasn't said one word to me. I also haven't had one gig because as soon as Phyllis found out what happen between Yitzhak and I, she took his side. (She was useless anyways.) I also have no band because they took Yitzhaks side as well. Why does there have to be sides? It's not like I haven't been trying to fix it. He won't talk to me. So now I'm alone, in New York City, with barely any money. I consider calling Tommy a few times but then I remember that's what got me in trouble in the first place. I pick up my notebook from the dresser and turn to the page I had been scribbling on for days. I started writing a new song, or was trying to at least. It was just a draft, for now, but I wrote it for Yitzhak. I debate with myself if I should take it to him. Maybe this could get us talking? I make an envelope out of another piece of paper and put the song into it with another little note for him that says 'This is what you wanted, isn't it?' I close up the envelope, and walk to the room right next to mine. I don't even bother to knock; they'll all just slam the door in my face. I take a deep breath and slide the envelope under the door and run back to my room. I just hope he reads it before he rips it up. A whole day passes, 24 hours, nothing. I assume Yitzhak has ripped it up, or worse. At this point, I really don't have any motivation to get up and do anything. I don't see the point. I decide to lie down on the bed, maybe I'll take a nap. I turn the TV on for background noise, I hate sleeping alone. I lay down on my side but something doesn't feel right. Half of the bed is so cold and empty feeling, but I get an idea. Fortunately for me, Yitzhak left his pillow, so I grab it and wrap myself around it as if it were actually him. I lay my head on it and take a deep breath. It smells like the cologne he usually wears. Just the smell of his cologne makes me feel better. I haven't slept a wink since Yitzhak left and oddly enough it helps me sleep. I wake up a few hours later, still wrapped around Yitzhak's pillow. I roll over to get up but see a person standing towards the door. Still half asleep, I scream when I finally realize what I'm staring at. \"Stop screaming.\" The voice says sternly. I stop screaming because I recognize the voice. \"Yitzhak?\" I ask as I turn on the light and my eyes take a minute to adjust. Sure enough, there he is, still standing in the corner. \"Jesus Christ, were you trying to give me a heart attack?\" I say putting a hand over my quickly beating heart. Yitzhak doesn't say anything but continues to look at me. I feel slightly embarrassed because I know he saw me sleeping with his pillow. I clear my throat and push away his pillow. I sit up and look at Yitzhak. I can see he's holding something, is it my note? \"Are you going to sit down?\" I ask. He shrugs his shoulders and stands by the door for a few extra seconds before sitting on the edge of the bed with his back facing me. I sigh and scoot down the bed so I'm sitting next to him. When I get close enough, I can tell it's my note he's holding. \"Did you read it?\" I ask calmly. \"Yes.\" He said simply. I can tell he had looked over it more than once. It was crinkled from his strong grip and his anger. \"Do you like it? I wrote it for you?\" He looks down at it then looks at me through his peripheral vision then back down at the paper. \"Was it really for me, or for him?\" I get upset and somewhat angry at this question but I try to stay calm. \"You, I wrote it when you left me. It's all I could really work on.\" He grunts. I can tell he doesn't believe me. He gets up and leaves the note on the bed. \"You don't believe me?\" I ask to prove to myself that I'm right. \"I don't see why I should?\" The mix of anger and hurt was becoming stronger, I didn't know which one was dominate. \"Then why the fuck did you come?\" I asked him trying not to cry. \"Phyllis made me.\" I let out a silent breathy laugh. \"Phyllis made you?\" I whisper shaking my head. He wasn't here because he wanted to be. He was here because Phyllis wanted us to make up so we could go back on tour, and so she could make money. A single tear falls and I pick up the note. I take a deep breath before ripping the paper and throwing it back at him. \"I guess you know what to tell Phyllis.\" I say crawling back towards my pillow. Yitzhak just shakes his head, almost like he feels sorry for me. \"Just go!\" I scream \"You clearly don't want to be here with me, so just go!\" I say. I close my eyes and wait for him to come over to the bed but he never does. A few seconds later I hear the door shut behind him. I lay my head on Yitzhaks pillows and cry. I hate being this emotional. It makes me crazy; I make poor decisions and right now was no different. I lean over to the end table and pick up the phone. I dial the number and wait for the answer. \"Hello?\" I hear the voice say and for a moment it calms me. \"T-Tommy?\"[Chapter 4] (Finally, here is chapter 4. I struggled with this chapter slightly, so it took me a little longer than usually to write it. Plus, because it's one of the longer chapters, I was really avoiding editing this but it's done! I really like how this chapter turned out. I hope you like it too. If you do maybe leave a review? As always, I own nothing. The amazing JCM does3) Chapter 4 I don't know why I called him. He's the first person I can think of, I didn't have anyone else. I needed to talk to someone who would understand me clearly and he's the one, the one who knows me. As much as we both want to deny it, we know it's true. Sometimes I think he knows me better than I know myself. When he picks up the phone, I'm relieved to hear his voice. \"T-Tommy?\" I say quietly. \"Hedwig?\" He asks in a confused tone. I close my eyes and clutch the phone waiting for the dial tone but I'm surprised to hear he answers. \"Are you alright?\" I shake my head even though I know he can't see me. \"I know what happened last week probably makes you never want to see me again but, I didn't know who else to call.\" I hear him sigh. \"I'm sorry Hedwig, I can't-\"I slump my shoulders in defeat. I should have known. \"Tommy, please.\" I whisper almost desperately. \"I just need someone to talk to.\" I don't think I've ever been this emotional in all my life. \"I'm not going to get punched again am I?\" He asked in a serious tone. \"No. he's gone.\" I say simply and I try to keep myself together but it's hard. I can't pretend anymore that all of this doesn't hurt. \"I have a little free time in between my CD signing and my concert. I guess we can meet up then.\" I smile. \"Where should we meet?\" I ask him. \"I'll come get you?\" I think for a moment. What about Yitzhak? I shake my head, it doesn't matter anymore. He's made that perfectly clear. \"Okay, Tomorrow.\" I confirm and hang up the phone. Instantly after, I feel a pang of regret. Christ, the conscious again? I lie back down and wrap myself around Yitzhak's pillow without even realizing it. I try to fall back asleep but suddenly I hear music coming from the next room. I get up slowly and press my ear against the wall. The walls were paper thin, you could hear almost everything. I could hear Phyllis talking on her latest cell phone and the band was goofing around, playing random songs and singing. I could pick Yitzhak's voice out of the group, easily, without a doubt. He sounded happy. It makes me remember when we used to do that. A lot of the times, Yitzhak would end up just sing to me. I take a few steps back from the wall until I fall back onto the bed. I take a couple of deep breaths to keep myself calm, I'm not about to get all worked up again. A few minutes later I'm startled by a knock at the door. I decide I'm not going to answer it, but the person outside doesn't sound like they're going to go away so, I reluctantly get up to answer the door. I'm surprised to see its Phyllis. I was almost kind of hoping it was Yitzhak. \"Can we talk for a moment?\" she asks. I debate on it for a moment and decide to let her in. I nod and open the door wider so she can enter. \"I just wanted to come see if you were alright.\" I walk back over to the bed and sit on the edge, rolling my eyes at her statement. \"After two weeks, thanks.\" I say sarcastically. \"Look, I'm sorry we iced you out. I just didn't think you needed my help anymore but Yitzhak said-\"I turn my head so quick to look at her I thought I got whiplash. \"Yitzhak said? Yitzhak said what?\" I ask angrily. \"Calm down, Yitzhak just said you didn't seem so well.\" I shake my head. \"Well, now that you can clearly see I'm fine, you can go.\" I lie and Phyllis sighs. I know she can see that I'm not all I say I am. \"Before I go, I just want to tell you, I finally booked us a new gig in Boston. We're leaving New York earlier than we planned.\" I instantly start to panic. What if I can't see Tommy? \"How much earlier?\" I ask as calmly as I can. \"We should probably leave the day after tomorrow if we want to get there in a decent amount of time. Now, I managed to smooth things out between the band and I'm here if you need me but there's a certain someone you may want to talk to.\" She winks. I hate when she does that, tries to fix Yitzhak and I's relationship. Our relationship is hard enough without other people butting in to it. \"We'll all talk more tomorrow; we need to have a band meeting anyways before we head out again. Have a good night.\" She says on her way out. I roll my eyes and flop back down on the bed as I watch her leave. I sleep a little better that night knowing now that everyone doesn't hate me, well, almost everyone. The next day, I wake up in the late afternoon. As I start to wake up, I feel like it's the best sleep I've gotten since we've been in New York. I smile, remembering that Tommy is going to be coming to get me soon. I get up, put on some music and hop in the shower. I will say the only good thing about not sharing the room with Yitzhak anymore was that I could shower first and there was still hot water left. I realize while I'm getting ready that my problem that had made me call Tommy in the first place was gone. Well, almost gone. I guess I could just try and enjoy our time together. It's probably the last time we're going to see each other for a long while anyways. My stomach turns at the thought. I shake it off and continue to get ready. I anxiously wait around for Tommy, not knowing when he'll show, or if he'll show at all. My doubts are put to rest when I hear him knock on the door and call for me. I run to answer it. \"You're here.\" I smile. He smiles back. \"I told you I would be.\" He says and gestures for me to come. As we walk to his limo, memories of the week before come flooding back and I instantly feel like I'm making the wrong choice. I'm not telling anyone that I'm going with him. Maybe I should at least leave a note? No, the last time I wrote a note it only made things worse. Tommy pulls me to walk faster, he's excited for something. I don't know what yet. I'm suspicious because he won't tell me where we're going. \"You're not gunna blind fold me are you?\" I ask him and he laughs to himself and shakes his head. \"Don't worry so much, okay?\" That's what I like about him, his care free attitude. Although come to think of it, he may have gotten most of that from me. Tommy looks over and I can feel him staring at me. \"I see you're feeling better.\" He mentions, trying to make conversation. I nod. Oh great, now he probably thinks I just put on an act last night. \"A lot has changed in the past twenty four hours.\" I say quietly. \"Well, I'm glad.\" The limo stops and Tommy gets out first, I follow him closely. I don't really know where we are but I follow him regardless. We enter a tall, extravagant building and we ride the elevator in silence almost to the top. He pulls out a set of keys and we walk into the apartment. \"What is this?\" I ask looking around. \"Home.\" He says. \"I'm impressed.\" I say quietly under my breath. He nods and throws his jacket over the couch. \"You want something to drink?\" he asks. I shrug. \"I guess whatever you're having.\" He walks off into the kitchen and I decide to look around. He's really made something of himself. I feel a surge of jealousy but I try not to let it resurface. It's kind of hard to push those feelings aside when I think about how all of this could have been mine. We had tried so many times to make a deal with Tommy but his manager wouldn't hear it. Homophobic bitch. I walk around slowly; Overwhelmed by all there is to see. I notice something interesting while I'm looking around. I see it on the coffee table in his living room. It's a poster, with his signature logo and different dates next to each state. I pick it up and look at it closer. Is this a tour poster? I shake my head in disbelief. Making a CD is one thing but now he was going to travel the states singing the songs I wrote? I had been traveling for month with the band and nothing. Now he thinks he can come in and take that from me too? I hear him coming back in and I hold the poster out so he can see it. \"Were you even going to tell me?\" I ask him almost feeling more hurt now than angry. \"Shit, you found that?\" He asks but considering that he wasn't even trying to hide it, I don't know why he's surprised. \"You're really going on tour?\" I ask him. He nods simply. \"It was my manager's idea.\" He said handing me the drink. \"Yeah, of course it was.\" I mumble. I shake my head and take a big swig of whatever was in the glass. It was some sort of alcohol, thank God. He puts his drink down and grabs the poster from me. I see him search for something on a nearby desk and then I see him scribbling on the poster. His face is beaming when he turns around. \"I was gunna wait until later, but since you found it now.\" He said turning the poster around to reveal it. I search for what's different. I look towards the top and see the change. Now it says 'Tommy Gnosis & Hedwig Robinson: Origin of Love Tour.' He added my name? \"Tommy? I don't-\"He looks at me with sincerity. \"I want you to come with me.\" I'm so surprised, I can't even move. No words are coming to mind. This is what I wanted all those years ago and I thought I always knew what I was going to say to him but now I didn't even know where to start. I almost blurt out yes but I really have to stop and think about it. I have another life, one that isn't with Tommy. Even though Yitzhak and I are on the rocks right now, I don't know if I could ever just up and leave him. We both love each other somewhere deep down inside and sometimes it just gets lost trying to surface. Then I start thinking about the band, and Phyllis. It's all starting to become overwhelming. \"I think I should sit for a minute.\" I say breathlessly and put my glass down on the side table. \"So are you coming?\" he asks. I take a few breaths and look into his eyes. So much of me wants to go with him but what if he's still the same person he was before? What if he decides he doesn't want me anymore? Can I risk that again? I can't get attached just to be heartbroken again. \"No.\" he looks at me with confused eyes. \"I'm sorry, I can't. Not again.\" I see him shake his head. \"This was our dream from before, you remember.\" He says pleading. \"Things are different now. I'm married with a band and a manager.\" I say. It almost sounds like some corny, twisted love story. \"That's what you want?\" He asked. I wasn't sure what I wanted but I nod. \"Oh.\" He drops the poster and walks over to the couch, sitting next to me. He puts a hand on my knee and we both freeze. He turns towards me and I turn my head to look at him. We stare at each other for a moment before he leans and places a kiss on my lips. When I don't stop him right away he keeps going. I almost feel guilty for wanting it. I pull away; I can't get any more attached than I already am. I knew this was going to happen. \"Tommy, I can't.\" I say getting up and taking another drink from my glass. \"Why not?\" he asks, his voice cracking slightly. \"Because I'm leaving tomorrow and I can't-\"I take a deep breath. I don't want to tell him the real reason. \"I should probably be getting ready to go.\" I say after a full minute of silence. He just nods his head, not having anything else to say. I don't want to cry in front of him, not again. He gathers his things and we head back down to the limo. I feel anxious the whole ride back, I don't even notice it but I'm fidgeting with my hands. He reaches out and puts his hands over mine to steady them. I look down and our hands and then up at him. He gives me a little smile and let's go of my hands. When we get to my hotel, I make my way out of the limo and notice Tommy follows me. \"Hey, you aren't going to say goodbye?\" he asks. I'm surprised, I really didn't think he was the kind of person to say goodbye. I really should stop holding the grudge on him for running out on me all those years ago. I walk back over towards the limo and give him a hug. I always felt we were a perfect fit. It was the most comfortable I felt in days. We break apart and I give him one last kiss, nothing sexual, just the goodbye we never got to have the first time. When I break apart, I happened to look up and see Yitzhak looking out of the window to our room. Shit, not again. I see him disappear quickly. I pull away from Tommy, our hands letting go of each other's one last time and start running to get to my room before Yitzhak starts jumping to conclusions. I don't even bother to take the elevator. I run up the few flights of stairs quickly (well, as quickly as I could in heels) to get to my room. I fumble with the room key before finally making my way inside. I huff, nearly wanting to pass out from being so out of breath. He's still here, thankfully. He's sitting on the edge of the bed, avoiding me. \"Hi. I'm back.\" I say trying to start conversation. I walk slowly over to the edge of the bed and sit down next to him. He doesn't move a muscle. \"Where the hell have you been?\" I know he knows the answer. He saw. \"I went out for a little while, is that a crime?\" I ask. \"We thought something happened to you! You could have been dead for all we knew!\" he screamed in frustration. I look at him. He's up now, breathing heavily. \"I was only gone a few hou-\"He cuts me off. \"It doesn't matter how long you were gone for. You didn't tell anyone you were leaving so we thought you went missing. You've been locked in here for the past two weeks; we didn't expect you to be gone.\" He said looking at me for an answer. \"I'm sorry.\" I didn't know what else to say. I know now that he's said his peace and we're just avoiding what happened outside. He paces back and forth and few times before stopping. I can see he wants to say something, so I get it over with. \"I know you saw.\" I say knowing he knows what I'm talking about. He shakes his head. \"You were with him again?\" He asks. \"What is it about him? Why does it always have to be him?\" He asks me. Honestly, I don't even know the answer to that. And even if I did, the answer would never stay the same for long. I was always changing my mind. I shrug and I see him give me a look of disbelief. \"I'm your husband, when am I going to come before him?\" I can see his anger is dissipating and turning into hurt. When I can't answer him, he turns around and walks out, calmly this time. Little does he know I've made one of the biggest decisions of my life. I chose him for once and he doesn't even know it. He doesn't know what really happened outside and who knows if he's going to actually give me a chance to explain it to him.[Chapter 5] (So, Chapter 5 is finally finished :)! I've been procrastinating so hard with this, for the past two weeks all I've had to do is finish the last 3 sentences and do one final edit. I'm sorry this took so long. Plus side is, I've already got the next couple chapters semi-planned so I just need to get to writing. I hope I've still got some readers. If you have suggestions or comments feel free to let me know. You can follow me on tumblr if you wish, I post updates sometimes and I'd love to make new friends :) * .Com *) After Yitzhak had walked out, I spent a lot of time staring at the door waiting for him to come back. I wanted to tell Yitzhak what happened. No, I needed to tell him. If there was any chance of us fixing our relationship, he had to know. He needed to know it wasn't what it looked like. He needed to know that for once, I chose what was best for all of us and not just for me. I needed him to know that I chose him over Tommy. After about an hour of waiting I give up and start getting ready for bed. I suddenly remember that we're leaving tomorrow and none of my things are packed up. I sigh in exhaustion, dig my bag out of the closet and begin packing. I didn't even know where to begin. I didn't realize I had so much stuff; usually Yitzhak is here to help me. Now I have to do it alone. It takes me longer this time to pack because I find myself staring at every little thing that reminds me of Yitzhak or even Tommy. I finally finish packing around 5 a.m. I hadn't noticed until I was finished that it took me all night, I didn't think it was going to be this hard. I was so tired and I had no idea what time we were leaving but I try to get some sleep regardless. I knew waking up and facing him was going to be rough. \"Hedwig! Hedwig! Open the door!\" I jolt awake to some lunatic banging on my door. Phyllis? I could kill her. I look over at the clock, 7:30 a.m. Is she psychotic? I stumble out of bed and put on my robe before answering the door. I open the door to let her in and lean on the wall for support. \"Rough night?\" She questions and I glare at her behind her back because I know she knows the answer. She starts looking around the room. \"Good, I see you're all packed up. We're packing the cars now. Bring your things out so the boys can put it in the car and then we're hitting the road!\" She says too cheerfully for the morning. I groan at her and she puts both of her hands on my face. \"Today is a new day, make it count. Now get a move on!\" She says before rushing out of the room. I throw on the outfit that I left out for myself and shove my robe into my bag. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I feel like death. Two and a half hours of sleep is definitely not going to be enough to get me through this day. I gather up my bags and bring them down to the car. I stop at a distance and see Yitzhak helping the other boys pack everything in the cars. He still looks upset. I take a deep breath and start to walk over to the car. What was I so afraid of? I take my bags off my shoulders and Yitzhak takes them from me without saying a word. I begin to say something but he pushes right past me and starts to head back up for the last of our stuff. I follow him, determined to talk to him. \"Can you slow down?\" I ask him while huffing out of breath, trying to keep up with him. I can barely stand, let alone chase him through the hotel. He ignores me. \"I need to talk to you.\" He stops suddenly, I almost run into him. \"I have nothing to say.\" He says without looking at me. Before he can start walking away again, I try to grab his hand but he pulls away from me. \"Yitzhak?\" He keeps on walking. I don't even try to follow him this time. I turn around and head back down to the lobby, so much for a new day. I roll my eyes thinking about what Phyllis said to me earlier. I wait in the lobby, figuring it was best if I stayed out of the way. Phyllis came and got me after she had checked out and we were ready to go. She grabs my hand and leads me outside. \"Now, I know you may not like it but I'm going to drive the car with the boys and you are going to ride with Yitzhak. Okay?\" She says as quickly as possible. I start freak out a little. \"Why would you make that arrangement? You know what's happening between us right now!\" I say knowing I'm starting to make a scene but at this point, I don't care. \"Hedwig, please.\" She says grabbing my arm and trying to calm me down. \"You weren't here last night when we had the meeting. You know Yitzhak, yourself, and I are the only ones that know how to drive. Since you weren't here, you don't know the routes and the stops so Yitzhak and I have to drive and there's no room left in my car with all the boys and the equipment.\" She says starting to walk over to her car. \"Phyllis?\" I plead with one final attempt and it's at this time I realize, I'm screwed. What a great trip this was going to be. I hesitantly walk over to the car. I will never forgive Phyllis for this. I know she did this on purpose. One of the boys could have switched with me. I get in the car and put my seatbelt on without saying a word. Yitzhak doesn't speak either. I turn my head to say something but I shake my head. Forget it; he's going to ignore me the whole trips anyways, why bother. Phyllis gives the signal and we head out on the road. I lean my head against the window and sigh. I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open. At some point, I finally get comfortable enough to fall asleep, but I regret it. Every time I close my eyes I see Tommy. I can't stop thinking about him. I don't want to think about him anymore but I can't get him out of my mind. Now, he's even invading my dreams. It's so vivid, it almost seems real. I dream about Tommy asking me to go on tour with him, our last kiss, what we would be like if I had gone on tour with him; doing what we dreamed about all those years ago. It's nice to finally have a peaceful dream for once. But then it takes a turn for the worse. It turns into a nightmare. Scenes flashing of Tommy leaving me, of standing there all alone, seeing him on stage singing what we wrote together. It all just becomes too much and I jolt awake. I look around, breathing heavily and I notice we're stopped. I look outside and see Yitzhak pumping gas. This must be where we were stopping first. I steady my breathing and put my head back against the seat. Yitzhak finishes pumping gas and gets back in the car. I see out of the corner of my eye, that he's looking at me. He's still not saying a word to me. I'm unsure if I should start talking to him or just go back to sleep. \"Where are we?\" I ask him quietly. I hear him sigh. \"Connecticut.\" He says simply. I look at him while he starts the car. I wait until we start moving to bring up the subject of last night. This way he can't run away from me again. \"Can we talk about last night?\" He ignores me. \"Please?\" I make one finally attempt. He still doesn't answer me. \"Can you not act like a fucking child for once?\" I say angrily. \"What do you want me to say?!\" He says just as angrily. \"You don't have to say anything; I just want you to listen!\" I plead. \"I'm tired of hearing about you and him. I'm done hearing it, seeing it, and talking about it.\" He slams his hands against the steering wheel in frustration and I jump slightly. \"I can't believe you won't even trust me to tell you the truth.\" He shakes his head. \"I don't know what to believe anymore; clearly you've made your choice.\" Now I really can't even believe what I'm hearing. \"Are you fucking kidding me? You don't know what my choice is because you won't listen to a single God damn word that I have to say! If you would have let me explain last night instead of walking out like a child, you would have known that I went to talk to Tommy because I was upset about you and I and he asked me to go on tour with him and I said NO!\" I pant quickly trying to catch my breath and he turns his head quickly to look at me. \"He asked me to go on tour with him and I said no. He took me home and we kissed goodbye because we're probably not going to see each other for a very long time. It was our goodbye, okay? The one I never got to have. Now , you know my choice.\" I try to keep from getting upset but I can't help it. The last couple of days have been the worst and screaming and crying almost seemed to make it a little better. Thank God the highway was practically empty because I could only imagine what it would have looked like to someone else who was passing us. I have my head in my hands and I can still feel Yitzhak glancing over at me. We both stay silent for a moment, both of us not really having anything to say. \"Hedwig?\" He says gently. I shake my head. \"I'm sorry.\" He says. I look up straight ahead with wet eyes. I refuse to look at him. \"I know I fucked up going to see Tommy, but I didn't have anyone else. None of you would talk to me. I thought we were done.\" Yitzhak looks back at the road and then to me. \"We both fucked up. We didn't handle it the way we should have. I shouldn't have been ignoring you.\" I take a deep breath. \"I'm sorry too.\" I whisper. That's probably the first time I've apologized to him with sincerity. He deserved it, after all the shit I put him through. \"I don't deserve any of this.\" I shake my head. \"I don't deserve you.\" I close my eyes and I feel him put his hand on my thigh. I look up at him finally and I put my hand over his and squeeze it. \"Don't say that.\" He says. \"We both need each other.\" He admits and I know he's right. \"We can fix this, right?\" I ask him as I feel myself falling asleep. I don't hear him answer because I know that he doesn't know the answer, neither do I. As drift back to sleep, I hold on to Yitzhak's hand tightly. It's the first time we've really touched in almost a month. I feel him trying to slip his hand out from under mine but I don't let him. It was stupid, but I almost slept better with his hand on my thigh. Just knowing he was next to me finally, after all this time, that's all I needed. When I wake up, I feel different. We're not in the car anymore. We're in a hotel room. When did we even get to Boston? How long have I been sleeping? I sit up quickly, panicking when I don't see Yitzhak. Maybe I was still in New York and what just happened was all a dream. My worries are put to rest when I see Yitzhak walk out of the bathroom. \"I would say good morning, but it's pretty late in the afternoon.\" Yitzhak says to me as he walks over to the bed. \"When did we get to Boston?\" I ask him. \"About eleven-thirty.\" He says and sits next to me. \"How did I get in here? I don't remember anyone waking me up.\" Yitzhak lets out a breathy laugh; I know he can see the confusion on my face. \"I carried you.\" He said simply like it was no big deal but I smile to myself. He returns to unpacking our things, which I assume he was doing before I woke up. \"Why didn't you wake me up?\" I want to get out of the bed and help but it feels so nice. \"I know you needed the sleep.\" I nod because he's right. I'm almost glad he let me sleep. \"Well, thank you.\" I said slowly working my way out of bed. I watch Yitzhak closely and smile. I can't believe he's still here. After all we been through these past couple weeks, I feel like I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own Hedwig or anything affiliated with it.

Lampu lampu menyala berperang menyaingi terangnya bintang di langit. Ini saatnya Kyungsoo untuk bangun dan menjalani hidupnya. Ya hidupnya... \"Appa, makanan sudah siap\" Kyungsoo kembali ke meja makan dan menunggu kedua orangtuanya untuk makan malam bersama. \"Selamat makan\" Suasana makan yang tenang dan hangat. Kyungsoo sangat menyukai saat makan malam bersama kedua orangtuanya. Biasanya tuan dan nyonya Do akan bercerita mengenai suasana di restoran dan tingkah konyol pelanggan mereka. Kyungsoo bisa tertawa terbahak bahak jika mendengar kisah orangtuanya yang seharian mengelola restoran kecil mereka di depan stasiun bawah tanah. Bukan sekali saja Kyungsoo berniat membantu orangtuanya di restoran. Suatu kali ia diam diam masuk ke restoran dan mulai membantu melayani pelanggan. Namun tidak lama ia jatuh pingsan saat mengantar pesanan. Orangtuanya melarang ia untuk datang ke restoran. Bukan tidak ingin dibantu tapi ia tidak boleh. Hanya tidak bisa. \"Appa eomma, aku pergi dulu\" Kyungsoo berpamit menenteng gitarnya menyusuri jalanan lembab berbau tanah bekas hujan sore tadi. Setiap malam Kyungsoo akan menghabiskan waktunya di taman di kawasan rumahnya. Memainkan gitar dan menyanyikan lagu ciptaannya ditemani lilin aromaterapi kesukaannya. \"Selamat sore tuan dan nyonya Do\" sapa Baekhyun saat appanya Kyungsoo membukakan pintu. Baekhyun langsung menaiki tangga ke kamar Kyungsoo tanpa melihat ekspresi tuan rumah. \"Dia masih tidur. Tolong jangan di ganggu ne?\" Pinta eomma Kyungsoo dan langsung ditanggapi Baekhyun dengan langkahnya yang sangat hati hati memasuki kamar Kyungsoo di lantai dua. Pemandangan dari kamarnya sangat indah, menghadap ke arah laut. Dengan jendela yang besar di balkon, Baekhyun sangat menikmati kapanpun dia berkunjung ke sini. Interior kamar Kyungsoo sederhana tidak sedikit pun menuujukkan kemewahan. Serba blue sky, warna kesayangan Kyungsoo. Poster penyanyi zaman kini, beberapa bingkai foto ala Kyungsoo, dan sebuah gitar arkustik di pojok kamar sangat menunjukkan sisi seorang Kyungsoo. \"Mataharinya hampir terbenam\" bisik Baekhyun. \"Annyeong\" serak Kyungsoo. Baekhyun membalas sapaan sahabatnya itu sambil tersenyum. \"Sebaiknya kau mandi dulu\" \"Ne\" Kyungsoo Pov \"Apa kabar mu Baekiah?\" Aku menghampiri Baekhyun yang melamun di balkon kamar ku. \"Kabar baik Kyungie. Kau sendiri?\" \"Much better. Thank you.\" Aku duduk di sampingnya saling berpandang dan akhirnya tertawa. Kami sama sama memandang matahari yang semakin menghilang di ufuk barat. Baekhyun menceritakan hari harinya sebagai siswi SMA biasa, membolos, tidak mengerjakan PR, tidur di kelas, dan kekonyolan teman sekelasnya saat tamasya musim panas minggu lalu. Aku sangat antusias mendengar cerita Baekhyun, kehidupan yang tidak bisa kumiliki sebagai seorang remaja. Baekhyun satu satunya teman yang ku miliki seumur hidupku, jendela yang mengenalkan ku pada manisnya menjadi seorang remaja. \"Kyungsoo ya, Baekhyun-ah ayo makan\" ibu ku sudah memanggil, saatnya kami turun dan bergabung dengan orangtua ku untuk makan malam. \"Selamat makan\" seru ku dan Baekhyun bersamaan. Baekhyun sudah menjadi anggota keluarga keempat di rumah kami. Ibunya telah meninggal empat tahun lalu, ayahnya sibuk mencari nafkah hingga lupa Baekhyun sering kesepian dan butuh perhatian. Ayah ibu ku tidak keberatan karena orangtua Baekhyun adalah teman kecil mereka. \"apa kau akan ke taman malam ini?\" Tanya Baekhyun, aku mengiyakan. Ia menawarkan diri untuk menemani, aku tidak keberatan karena malam ini aku pasti tidak kesepian. Kami menaiki sepeda Baekhyun ke taman lebih cepat dari berjalan kaki. Taman tampak lengah saat jarum jam tangan ku menunjukan pukul 10.30 malam. Kami membersihkan lantai di tengah taman dan duduk diatasnya. Baekhyun membantuku menyalakan lilin dan duduk manis menantiku untuk menyanyikan lagu ciptaan ku. Baekhyun bertepuk tangan, wajahnya tampak puas mendengar satu lagu ciptaanku. Aku mengedarkan pandangan ku ke seluruh taman sambil menghirup udara yang dilambai dedaunan. Itu dia, bisikku pada diri sendiri. \"Nuguya?\" Tanya Baekhyun penasaran mengikuti arah pandangan ku yang tanpa kedip. \"Kau mengenalnya?\" \"Aniya\" jawabku pelan. Aku menunduk lemas tapi entah kenapa aku merasakan bahagia yang sangat mendebarkan tiap melihatnya. \"Apa kau suka namja itu?\" Pertanyaan Baekhyun langsung menancap di jantung ku membuatku gugup tak beralasan. Aku gak tahu harus bereaksi apa karena aku pun tak bisa mengerti perasaan bodoh ini.. Tbc Mian garing cos ini masih tahap introduce.

(^.^)V \"Apa kau suka namja itu?\" Pertanyaan Baekhyun langsung menancap di jantung ku membuatku gugup tak beralasan. Aku gak tahu harus bereaksi apa karena aku pun tak bisa mengerti perasaan bodoh ini.. Chapter 2 Song by: Ailee - Heaven Sejak malam di taman bersama Baekhyun, Kyungsoo tak henti hentinya memikirkan perkataan sahabatnya itu. 'Apa kau suka namja itu?' \"Ani..aniya..\" Kyungsoo menggeleng berusaha menjauhkan kenyataan hingga ia kembali melihat namja itu dari balkon kamarnya, ia yakin tidak dapat menghindar. \"Bagaimana ini?\" Ia melihat namja itu tersenyum setelah meneguk minuman dinginnya. Perasaan lega namja itu seolah dapat ia rasakan dengan baik. Seolah ingin berlari saat itu juga menghampiri namja itu dan memeluknya. Jantungnya semakin berdetak cepat saat namja itu duduk di bangku sambil mengadahan kepalanya menikmati udara malam musim panas. Dan kini ia ingin menyandarkan kepalanya di dada bidang sang namja. Gila, itulah deskripsi Kyungsoo atas perasaannya saat ini. Bukan sekali ini dia melihat namja itu berhenti untuk membeli minum di mesin minuman yang dapat terlihat jelas dari balkon kamarnya, tapi ia rasa ini memang semakin gila. \"Tidak mungkin. Ini mustahil\" namja itu perlahan menghilang menggunakan motor matiknya. Semakin jauh membuat Kyungsoo sangat sedih kehilangannya. Malam ini seperti malam yang pernah berlalu bersama Baekhyun. Dia kabur dari jam pelajaran tambahan di sore hari. Melarikan diri ke rumah kami, menyentuh dan mengotak-atik segala benda yang dianggap menarik yang ada di kamarku. \"Kau akan makan malam bersama kami?\" Aku memastikan dan dia mengangguk. Aku mengajaknya turun ke ruang makan dan bergabung dengan orangtuaku. Aku tersenyum dan memandang Baekhyun yang tersenyum sama cerianya denganku. Hidangan malam ini adalah kesukaan ku dan Baekhyun. Makanan laut yang diracik dengan bumbu yang banyak dijual di pasar namun terasa berbeda jika dibuat oleh ibuku. Aku melirik ayah dan ibu, mereka juga tersenyum senang dan misterius. Baekhyun bertanya apa hari ini hari yang spesial karena dia sangat senang menikmati makan malamnya. Aku juga menanti jawaban dengan sesekali mengalihkan pandanganku dari piring ke kedua orangtuaku di seberang meja. Mereka diam. Tak menjawab. \"Tanggal berapa ini?\" \"25 juni. Kenapa?\" Baekhyun melihat kalender sekilas lalu menatapku lekat. Aku bangkit dari kursi. Berjalan ke belakang kedua orangtuaku dan memeluk mereka. \"Mian appa eomma aku lupa. Selamat ulangtahun pernikahan\" aku mencium puncak kepala mereka yang kini mulai dihiasi rambut putih. Terpintas perasaan bersalah karena tidak pernah berhenti membebankan mereka dengan kekhawatiran. Tapi aku juga tidak bisa memberi lebih dengan keadaanku sekarang. Mataku terasa memanas saat mereka mengucapkan terima kasih dan membalas rangkulanku. Apa yang perlu mereka terima kasihkan dari ku yang selalu menjadi beban? Ah sudahlah. Tak perlu menjadi melankolis di meja makan. kuputuskan untuk melanjutkan makan. Baekhyun juga mengucapkan selamat kepada orangtuaku dan beberapa kalimat lain yang membuat kami pecah dalam tawa. Suasana menjadi hangat karena Baekhyun, selalu. Baekhyun mempersiapkan diri, duduk bersila dengan setianya menunggu Kyungsoo yang sedang mempersiapkan gitarnya. Nyala lilin aromaterapi yang diletakkan diatas kotak gitar memberi terang diantara mereka yang duduk berhadapan. \"Apa lagunya selesai?\" Kyungsoo mengangkat kedua alis dan bahunya. \"Selesaikan secepat mungkin. Apa kau tak kasihan melihatku menunggu?\" Baekhyun memberikan tatapan menyelidik khasnya. \"Aku senang mendengarnya\" santai Kyungsoo dan dijawab desisan oleh sahabatnya. Kyungsoo memetik gitarnya. Melakukan pemanasan sebelum akhirnya memainkan nada dan mengalunkan lagu dengan nada yang lembut. Petikan gitar yang halus seakan menyatu dengan suara indah milik Kyungsoo. Where you are, I will be there too Where you go, I will go there too I smile for you every day, I pray for you With thoughts of you, I fall asleep - I open my eyes as I call for you You protect me by my side and you embrace me You are my heaven You're my only one way Only for you - I am thankful that I am next to you You're the only one babe You taught me love in this harsh world - I am happy with you alone Heaven Heaven Heaven Heaven Heave If we're together we will never cry never never cry Heaven Heaven Heaven Heaven Heaven Forever, together - never gonna be alone Kyungsoo mengakhiri lagunya dengan baik. Hening pecah oleh tepuk tangan dan seruan Baekhyun yang gak kalah heboh dibanding seseorang yang sedang menonton konser musik. \"Apa itu akhirnya?\" Sang penyanyi mengangguk. \"Itu hebat kawan. Sangat keren..\" puji Baekhyun. \"..dan menyedihkan\" Kyungsoo hanya tersenyum tipis tidak membantah. Ia tidak memungkiri bahwa lirik lagunya sedih. Sangat sedih menurut ekspresi Baekhyun yang hampir meneteskan airmatanya. Ia tidak tahu apa yang merasukinya untuk menulis lagu itu. Ia juga tidak bisa menjawab ketika Baekhyun bertanya untuk siapa lagu itu ditujukan. Bahkan saat Baekhyun terlihat sangat memaksa dan menghakimi pun ia tidak yakin untuk siapa lagu itu dibuat. Kini dua sahabat yang sama sama bertubuh mungil itu sedang menengadah menatap langit. Bintang sangat terang seolah membalas senyuman mereka. Kyungsoo mulai menunjuk-nunjuk langit. Membentuk sesuatu dari tangannya kemudian mereka pun tertawa. Baekhyun juga melakukan hal yang sama dan berakhir dengan tawa merdu mereka berdua. \"Satu lagu lagi sebelum kita pulang\" Baekhyun mengangkat tubuhnya untuk kembali duduk dan siap untuk mendengarkan suara sahabatnya. Kyungsoo juga mengambil posisi yang sama dihadapannya dan mulai mencari nada yang tepat digitarnya. Saat Kyungsoo mulai bernyanyi, mengedarkan pandangannya ke seluruh taman sebelum akhirnya ia menemukan sosok itu lagi di sana. Sedang berjalan diluar batas taman masih dengan seragam sekolahnya. Langkahnya tidak pelan namun terlihat sangat lelah. Petikan gitar Kyungsoo terhenti. Ia meletakkan gitarnya dan berdiri tiba tiba lantas berlari menjauhi taman. \"KYUNGSOO-YA!\" Dunia Kyungsoo seakan kosong dan hampa. Teriakan Baekhyun tak lagi didengarnya. Ia berlari berharap hembusan angin membawannya sampai pada tujuannya, sosok itu. Tak peduli pada nafasnya yang kini terdengar berantakan, baginya bertemu sosok itu lebih penting. Semakin dekat langkah Kyungsoo semakin bersemangat. Ia tidak dapat mengendalikan dirinya hingga menabrak sosok itu yang berjalan membelakanginya. BRUKK! Kyungsoo jatuh dengan sosok itu sebagai alasnya. Sontak berdiri saat sosok lelaki yang ditimpanya meringis kesakitan. \"Maaf. Kau tak apa? Apa ada yang terluka?\" Jelas terdengar kekhawatiran dalam suara Kyungsoo dan yang tertimpa hanya menggeleng sebagai jawaban. \"Apa kau ingin mengatakan sesuatu padaku?\" Tanya sosok itu karena mereka terlalu lama diam di tempat sementara Kyungsoo hanya menunduk. \"Perkenalkan. Aku Kyungsoo, Do Kyungsoo. Umur 18 tahun. Warna favorit ku adalah biru dan makanan kesukaan ku adalah mi kacang hitam. Aku suka mendengarkan lagu dan menulis beberapa lirik dengan gitarku. Senang berkenalan denganmu\" Kyungsoo membungkukkan badan diakhir pengenalan dirinya yang sangat bersemangat. Sosok dihadapannya terkejut dan mundur selangkah. \"Apa kau mengenalku?\" Tanyanya. \"Aku sering melihatmu melewati taman\" Kyungsoo tersenyum malu sambil menunjuk ke arah belakang. Sang pria mengangguk. \"Hmm.. Aku Jongin. Kim Jongin\" Tbc Gimana readers? Greget gak? Dapat feelnya gak? Gak dapatkan? Hehe sorry karena ini fanfic pertama aku yang di publish.

Meski hanya diterangi lampu jalan yang tepat berada diatas mereka, Kyungsoo semakin yakin akan ketampanan namja di depannya. \"A.. Aku Kyungsoo.. Do Kyungsoo\" mereka saling berjabat tangan. Cukup lama. Bukan. Karena Jongin tapi Kyungsoo yang enggan melepas jabatan tangannya. \"Eh..\" Kyungsoo tersadar dan melepaskan tangannya. Mereka saling menunduk dalam hening. Sesekali Kyungsoo mencuri melihat namja di depannya. 'Sempurna. Jauh lebih baik bertemu langsung seperti ini' \"KYUNGSOO-YA!\" Teriakkan nyaring Baekhyun memecah heningnya malam. Baik Kyungsoo ataupun Jongin membulatkan mata melihat Baekhyun yang berlari menghampiri mereka. Nafasnya masih tersengal-sengal saat meraih pundak Kyungsoo. \"Gwenchana?\" Kyungsoo menepuk-nepuk pelan punggung Baekhyun. Yang ditanya hanya menggeleng. Butuh beberapa menit untuk Baekhyun agar kembali bernafas normal. Dan selama itu Jongin dan Kyungsoo hanya diam dalam canggung. \"Kenapa kau meninggalkanku?\" Semprot Baekhyun. \"Ku kira kau marah padaku, pabbo\" Kyungsoo membantah. \"Aku ada urusan\" \"Dengan namja ini?\" dengan polos tak berotaknya Baekhyun menunjuk Jongin satu satunya namja disana. Kyungsoo mengangguk pelan. Jongin salah tingkah. \"Ehem..\" Jongin bersuara. \" Sebaiknya aku pergi. Temanmu sudah jauh lebih baik\" Mereka melirik Baekhyun bersamaan. \"Bye~\" Kyungsoo membungkuk dalam dan membalas lambaian tangan Jongin. Baekhyun? Dia tampak heran. Sangat jelas. Wajahnya sangat menyiratkan beribu pertanyaan. \"Kau?\" Baekhyun menunjuk Kyungsoo dan Jongin -yang sudah menjauh- secara bergantian. \"Kajja!\" Baekhyun mengekori Kyungsoo yang berjalan cepat kembali ke taman. Gitar dan sepeda mereka masih tertinggal disana. Meski sudah bertahun-tahun lamanya berteman namun ini harus diakui Baekhyun. Dia tidak mengenal Kyungsoo! Seseorang yang sedang berjalan di depannya sekarang ini bukanlah sahabatnya. Bukan sahabatnya yang ia kenal hingga 10 menit yang lalu. Bukan sahabatnya yang mudah marah, pesimis, dan pelit senyum. Yang sedang ditatapnya saat ini adalah seorang Kyungsoo yang tenang, terlihat optimis, dan tersenyum dengan manisnya. Bahkan Baekhyun sendiri bisa jamin kalau orangtua Kyungsoo jarang meliihat putri tunggal kesayangan mereka ini tersenyum begitu indahnya. \"Apa kau tadi sudah minum obatmu?\" Kyungsoo mengangguk dan mulai membereskan gitarnya. Diraihnya sepeda yang bersandar pada pohon dan menuntunya ke luar taman. Baekhyun ada disana. Di hadapan Kyungsoo, menghentikan langkahnya dan hanya menatapnya misterius. \"Ayo pulang. Aku sudah lelah\" Kyungsoo menggeser pelan tubuh Baekhyun untuk mendapatkan jalannya kembali. Baekyun melangkahkan kakinya pelan mengikuti Kyungsoo yang sedang menuntun sepeda. Dia tidak mungkin lelah. Bagaimana seorang gadis yang lelah bisa berjalan riang dan tersenyum dengan semangat seperti itu? Apa yang terjadi padanya? Apa hubungannya dengan lelaki itu? Dan sepertinya aku pernah melihat lelaki tadi, tapi dimana ya? Baekyun menepuk nepuk pelipisnya. Pikirannya masih penuh dengan pertanyaan hingga ia menabrak punggung Kyungsoo yang sudah berhenti. \"Aku akan cerita saat waktunya tepat\" ujar Kyungsoo tanpa menatap lawan bicaranya, lalu kembali berjalan. . . . Malam kembali datang bersama dengan kehadiran Kyungsoo di taman tanpa seorang Baekhyun. Ia tampak bersemangat. Kejadian dua hari lalu masih mampu membuatnya senyam senyum sendiri. Pertemuan pertama secara langsung dengan Jongin bagaikan obat doping yang tak habis habisnya memberi semangat. Bahkan kini ia bersenandung riang sambil mempersiapkan 'konser kecil'nya. Apa aku bisa bertemu dengannya lagi malam ini? Diluar taman berhenti sebuah mobil polisi yang sedang berpatroli malam itu. \"Sedang apa gadis itu disana? Apa ia tidak bersekolah besok? Harusnya ia dirumah sedang mengerjakan tugasnya..\" Sang polisi sudah bersiap turun dari mobil dan hendak membentak namun di tahan oleh polisi yang satunya. \"Biarkan saja dia disana\" sahut polisi lain yang duduk di sebelahnya. \"Wae?\" Tanyanya heran. \"Kau mengenalnya?\" Polisi lain itu mengangguk. \"Orangtuanya memintaku untuk mengawasi gadis itu di saat malam seperti ini\" \"Tapi kenapa dia harus bermain di taman saat malam? Apa ia tidak sekolah?\" \"Anni. Dia sakit\" \"Sebaiknya kau tidak perlu tahu dan bantu aku untuk mengawasinya dari jauh\" \"Arraseo\" Lagu pertama telah selesai. Kyungsoo istirahat sejenak menatap langit hitam diatasnya. Apa aku bisa bertemu dengannya lagi malam ini? Ia memalingkan wajahnya ke arah jalan diluar taman. Gotcha! Dia disana. Namja tan itu sedang melintasi taman dengan langkah panjangnya. \"Chogi..\" Kyungsoo mengekori namja tan itu hingga nyaris bertubrukan saat namja itu berbalik menatapnya. \"Kau.. Kau yang menimpaku tempo hari kan?\" \"Ne, Jongin-ssi\" namja yang disebutkan namanya terbelak kaget. Tak menyangka gadis imut dihadapannya ini mengingat namanya. \"Ada yang bisa ku bantu ehm...\" Suara Jongin terhenti. Ia tidak ingat nama gadis dihadapannya itu. Pabbo! \"Kyungsoo.. Do Kyungsoo\" ia mengucapkannya dengan tersenyum manis hingga namja tan itu salah tingkah. \"Maukah kau mendengar laguku sebentar.. Jika kau tak keberatan\" ia mengucapkan kalimat terakhir dengan sangat pelan. Hampir seperti memohon. Kim Jongin, namja jangkung itu bahkan harus membungkukkan dirinya sedikit untuk bisa mendengar dengan jelas kalimat terakhir Kyungsoo. Ia juga bingung kenapa gadis dihadapannya itu mengucapkannya sambil memainkan tanah dengan kakinya. Jongin tersenyum. Ia merasa tingkah gadis itu sangat menarik. \"Kenapa tidak\" Kyungsoo mengangkat kepalanya tinggi agar bisa melihat namja itu dengan jelas. Tidak tersirat ragu dalam senyum namja itu. DEG \"T..te..terima ka..kasih\" Kyungsoo merutuki dirinya yang terbata. Kenapa pula ia harus gugup saat melihat namja itu tersenyum. Kyungsoo berjalan kembali ke gitarnya dengan Jongin yang mengekor dibelakang. Tanpa saling menyadari mereka sama sama tersenyum dan sibuk dengan memikirkan satu sama lain. Masih ditemani rembulan yang bergantung di langit berhias bintang bintang, namja tan itu sudah duduk manis dihadapan Kyungsoo yang merangkul gitar. Sang namja tak sedetik pun meluputkan pandangannya dari gadis mungil itu. Detik berlalu namun gadis bergitar itu tak juga menetik gitarnya. Jarinya terasa dingin dan kelu, detak jantungnya tak terkendali, pandangannya tak fokus terarah pada lilin aromaterapi. \"Aku tak akan menghina nyanyianmu ataupun permainan gitarmu. Jadi.. Lakukanlah\" Kyungsoo mengangkat dagunya dilihatnya namja tan itu dengan seksama. Bukan untuk menggagumi ketampanannya melainkan untuk mencari penghinaan atau kemarahan di mata namja itu. Tapi dia tidak menemukannya! Tidak secuil pun terlihat penghinaan dari tatapan namja itu. Ia hanya melihat ketenangan dan rasa penasaran yang teramat tinggi dalam tatapan mata itu. Bahkan senyumnya terlihat sangat membius... 'Apa yang kau pikirkan Do Kyungsoo?' Dia menggeleng-geleng pelan. 'Dia hanya menenangkanmu bukan memujamu. Tenang lah Kyungsoo, tenang..' Kyungsoo menghirup udara memenuhi rongga paru-paruunya kemudian menggeluarkannya dengan pelan. Begitu hinggga dia merasa tenang \"Baiklah\" dia bernyanyi. Niga inneun gose nado hamkke halke..

Pendengarannya masih mengingat jelas tiap lirik lagu dan bagaimana gadis mungil dihadapannya ini bisa sangat menghayatinya. \"Kau yang membuat lagu ini?\" Kyungsoo tersentak. \"Ne..\" Dia mengangguk. Tatapan Jongin terlihat kosong membuat Kyungsoo menarik kesimpulan bahwa lagunya sama sekali tidak menarik bagi namja itu. 'Kau hanya ingin dia mendengar lagumu bukan untuk menyukainya, Kyungsoo pabbo!'Ia memaki. \"Kau...\" Tbc Gimana? Gimana?

Só para avisar ela é de um programa chamado Ninguem merece que passa no Disney Chanel! A minha fanfic acontece um tempo depois e os personagens ja estão mais velhos. Bom assim que descobrimos esse site minha amiga resolveu escrever uma fanfic,ela escreveu uma de crepusculo,eu tambem quis escrever uma então essa é a minha! =D =D =D =D =D =D Taylor PoV - Feliz aniversario!!-grita meu pai e estende um grande pacote todo embrulhado – Espero que você goste espirro. - Pai, já tenho 15 anos pode parar de me chamar assim!-digo agarrando o presente. - Tecnicamente você ainda tem 14 já que você nasceu à noite – minha mãe diz e se entrelaça no meu pai – É de nos dois, querida. O que isso quer dizer que foram pão-duros demais pra comprar dois o embrulho torcendo para não ser nada da loja do meu pai, eu odiaria ganhar calcinhas de novo!Enquanto arranco o durex do embrulho com a unha penso no que pode ser o presente, o embrulho é grande demais para um celular, ou um Ipod, ou um MP3...O que mais de legal eles podem me dar? - Um laptop!-minha cara está tão surpresa que eles tem a leve impressão que eu não gostei – É incrível,é lindo, é... - Caro? –diz meu pai rindo – É,ele não foi barato... - Mas valeu cada centavo. – diz minha mãe atropelando a fala de meu pai – Você gostou? \"Óbvio\"penso,mas apenas faço que sim com a cabeça. - Ele tem Internet? - Sim, ele tem tudo. – diz minha mãe animada por eu ter gostado do presente - Agora vá se arrumar pra escola. Me levanto da cama sem muita vontade,mas quando penso no dia que vou ter a animação aparece. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx - Posso dar o meu primeiro!!!!!! – grita o Ector quando eu e Britany entramos no ônibus. - Por que não esperamos o Lion – sugere Britany – Aposto que você agüenta! - Ta,ta,ta. – diz ele desaminado. – O que ganhou dos seus pais? - Um laptop!Caro,rosa e da \"Aplle\"! - Não creio! – diz Bri com sua cara de espanto mais engraçada – Eu nunca ganho presentes tão legais! - Pobrezinha. – diz o Ector ironicamente – Deixa-me dar meu presente agora por favooooooooooor!!!!!!!!!!!!! - Calma estamos quase no ponto do Lion. - Britany, não sei por que você liga tanto pro Lion! - Ector ele é nosso amigo. – digo tentando acalmar as coisas – E ele esperaria pela gente. - Não sei não do jeito que ele é impaciente. - O único impaciente aqui é você, Ector! –grita Bri, já irritada com a implicância de Ector. Nesse exato momento Lion entra no ônibus com um embrulho na mão. - Parabéns!- ele diz estendendo o embrulho para mim. - Ei!Eu ia dar o primeiro presente pra ela! - Calma Ector! – digo pegando o presente dele – Eu abro o seu primeiro! Abro o presente de Ector,que a propósito foi embrulhado a mã CD?E ele nem é comprado!Será que é cópia?Não, o Ector não me daria um presente tão furreca!E muito menos ficaria tão ansioso para eu abrir se fosse um presente meia boca desses! - É isso? – diz Britany, rompendo meus pensamentos. - Como assim \"isso\"! – Diz Ector irritado – Vocês sabem o que é isso? - Não – respondemos todos juntos. - Pois fiquem sabendo que essa é a gravação da nossa apresatação da 7ª serie! Aquela em que você dançou Bri! E você fez mímica Lion! E eu fiz malabarismo! E a Taylor cantou aquela musica linda! - É, eu me lembro disso! A Taylor passou a semana na minha casa por que os pais dela foram ver um emprego com um tio! - É,e a gente achou que aquele homem fosse cobrador! - Aquele foi um dia muito especial e foi por isso que achei que esse seria um presente especial! Um presente com sentimento, é bem a cara do Ector! =D =D =D =D =D Então gostaram? O proximo capitulo sai assim que ficar reviews![Chapter 2] Oi!!Desculpa a demora eu estava meio finalmente consegui postar!Bom, desculpe também pelos erros na ultima postagem ainda estou me acostumando com esse troç, aí vai o novo capitulo. **** -Que coisa meiga Ector! – diz Bri com seu olhar romantico – Se um dia eu tiver um namorado (um que preste) espero que seja tão meigo quanto você! – ela diz de forma melosa e olha esperançosa para Lion. - Posso dar o meu agora? – diz Lion, ignorando totalmente o que Brittany disse. - Claro! – diz Bri irritada – Deicha que eu do o meu por ultimo! - Desculpe Bri. – diz Lion todo sentimental – Você quer dar o seu primeiro? \"Como alguem pode ser tão tapado?\"penso,olho pra Bri e parece que ela esta pensando a mesma coisa, ela me entrega o presente ainda parecendo meio irritada. Abro curiosa.É um cordão escrito \"Taylor\". -Que lindo Bri, obrigada! – eu abraço ela – Sua vez Lion! Pego o embrulho dele é um livro chamado \"Penelope\". -Parece legal. – digo. - Por que a garota esta olhando para a parede? – pergunta o Ector. - É que ela tem cara de porco.-ele diz como se não fosse a coisa mais estranha do mundo, o olhamos como se ele estivesse maluco – Não calma é uma historia legal. Dou risada, Lion sempre me dá presentes engraçados, chegamos na escola todos saimos do ônibus,Brittany me puxa pelo braço. - Taylor, posso falar com você? - Quer saber se o Lion ta na sua? - Ta tão obvio assim? - Parece que o unico que não percebeu foi o Lion,mas fica calma, os garotos são assim. - Valeu, e feliz aniversario (de novo). Xxxxxxx Ector Pov -Feliz aniversario Taylor! – diz um garoto que eu nunca vi na vida. -Obrigada! – diz ela com um sorriso no rosto. O dia todo foi isso!Quando ela se tornou tão popular?!Lembro que antes ela se achava invisível (o que não era bem verdade pois todos a conheciam por sua criatividade) mas com o tempo ela e Brittany ficaram totalmente conhecidas nessa escola gigante! - Quem era?-pergunta Brittany, ganhando como resposta um breve \"sei lá\". - Como \"sei lá\"? Não acha estranho que alguém que você não conheça te deseje feliz aniversario?!?!?!? - Ei fica frio Ector! – ela diz e só então eu percebo o quão auto havia sido o meu grito de irritação – Ele deve fazer alguma aula comigo e eu me esqueci! Ela entra na sala junto com Brittany. Eu e Lion continuamos seguindo para nossas salas. - Rolou um ciúme? – pergunta ele rindo. - Hã?? – respondo sem pensar. - Não se finge de mal entendido! - ele ri – O dia todo sempre que algum garoto dava parabéns para a Taylor você fazia cara feia. - Você ta maluco! – digo tentando esconder o vermelho de minhas bochechas – Desde quando acha que eu gosto da Taylor!? - Pra começar eu não acho, eu sei, e não sou só eu!Todo mundo sabe! - Não respondeu minha pergunta! – falo mesmo que a pergunta que eu realmente queira fazer é \"A Taylor ta incluída nesse todo mundo?\". - Desde que eu te conheci!Feliz agora!? Ele entra na sala e eu continuo seguindo meu caminho até a minha. Lembro de tudo que se passou de uns tempos pra cá. Sinto saudade. Olho pra dentro da minha sala, todos estão conversando entro e me sento no primeiro lugar que vejo. Sinto falta de quando éramos todos da mesma turma,eu não tinha que ficar inseguro com onde sento. Um bando de garotas chega perto de mim. - Oi.- diz uma das garotas, como o ano começou a pouco tempo não lembro direito o nome dela, mas acho que é Susi - Ector né? – típico,se fosse Lion ou Britany ou Taylor não teria esse \"né\",mas como é só o Ector! – É.Por que? - A Taylor já mandou os convites pro aniversario dela? - Não. – \"eu tenho la cara de secretario\" penso – Ainda não. -Ah tá.Bom tchau. Vejo ela se afastando com as amigas penso em perguntar se ela quer que eu a avise quando a Taylor destribuir os convites,mas desisto.[Chapter 3] Taylor PoV - Ola, querida – diz meu pai quando entro em casa – como foi na escola? - Querida? - pergunto confusa. - Bom você disse que não queria que eu te chamasse de espirro. - Não! – eu rio – Eu tava só brincando! Nunca me acostumaria com você me chamando de outro jeito! Ele sorri. Eu jogo minha mochila no sofá. - Ganhou algum presente? - Aham. Ganhei um livro do Lion, um colar da Brittany e um CD do Hector. - CD? O Hector sempre dá um presente especial e com sentimento. - Não era um CD qualquer! Era a gravação daquela apresentação em que eu cantei, lembra? - Uau, já tinha até me esquecido! Bom essa foi uma ótima idéia, mas a melhor surpresa ainda será a nossa! – ele diz animado. - É, é dificil algo ganhar do Laptop. - Não era bem disso que eu estava falando. – ele diz fazendo misterio. - Então do que era? - Você logo saberá. - Odeio quando você faz isso. Xxxxx - Outra surpresa de aniversario?- Bri pergunta pelo telefone. - É o que parece.- digo tentando encontrar o controle da TV. - Um laptop já não é coisa demais? - Ei!Ta dizedo que eu não mereço?!-digo finalmente encontrando o controle e ligando a TV. - Você me entendeu. Alias porque você não desliga esse telefone e vem falar aqui comigo pessoalmente? - To ocupada – digo ligando o DVD e pondo o CD do Hector nele-Você não pode vir aqui? - Não to pintando as unhas.- eu dou play e o video começa,vejo a imagem da nossa antiga professora nos apresentando, o volume está alto demais,eu abaixo um pouco – O que você esta vendo aí? - O CD que o Hector me deu. Mas continuando, o que acha que deve ser? - Sei lá uma motocicleta rosa pra combinar com seu laptop. - Deicha de ser enveijosa!Sua mãe também te dá presentes legais. - Correção: dava, desde que comecei a trabralhar na loja do seu pai ela acha que sou madura o bastante pra parar de ficar pedindo presentes pra ela. - Uau,quando me ofereci pra trabalhar com meu pai junto com você meus pais ficaram tão orgulhosos de mim que... - Te deram um celular novo!Já sei essa historia,Taylor! - Foi mal!- digo vendo a imagem do Lion fazendo mimica na TV,dou risada. - Que foi? - Ah nada. É só o video. - O que apareceu?O que foi engraçado? - Era só o Lion fazendo mimica,nada demais. - Falando nisso eaí alguma ideia? - Do presente? - Não anta,de quem é que o Lion gosta? - Esquece isso foi a um mes, como você sabe se ele não deichou de gostar dela. - Taylor não seja burra!Não se para de gostar de alguém!Além disso se ele disse pro Hector que gosta de uma garota é porque ele gosta de uma garota, se não ele diria pro Hector que não gosta mais da garota! - Brittany,só estou dizendo que talvez nem seja alguém que a gente conheça, é idiotice a gente ficar pensando numa coisa que pode não fazer a menor diferença! - Falou a garota que ta toda preocupada em descobrir o presente que ela vai ganhar ainda hoje!- ela grita. - Uau Brittany incrivel como você só conversa sobre coisas que te interessão!-grito no telefone dando pause no DVD. - Desculpa. Eu sei que não devia ter ficado tão extressada e ter dito o que eu disse,mas sei lá, e se o Lion gostar de mim? - Tudo bem.Não acha que devia perguntar pra ele, ou talvez chamar ele pra sair? - Mas isso não faria sentido se ele gostasse de outra garota. - Você tem de tentar. - Eu pensei em convida-lo para ser meu par na sua festa. - Que perfeito!Boa ideia! - Ja decidiu com quem você vai? - Acho que vou com o Hector. – digo dando play de novo no DVD. - Com o Hector?!E desde quando você gosta do Hector?! - Eu não gosto,mas ele é meu melhor amigo desde sempre,faz muito mais sentido eu ir com ele do que com um garoto qualquer de quem estou a fim no momento! - Uau, nunca havia pensado dessa maneira - Bom mas falando na festa tenho de ir na casa de festas fazer a reserva... - Não diga \"casa de festas\"! – ela me enterrompe- Parece coisa de bebe! - Então quer que eu diga o que? - Salão. – ela diz com uma voz chique. - Ta tenho de ir ao salão fazer a reserva pra festa, feliz?- pergunto com voz debochada. - Muito!Mas sinseramente Taylor porque ta me contando isso? - Porque por causa disso eu não vou poder trabalhar hoje! - O que??Vai me deixar dobrando cuecas sozinha?!?!- ela berra. - Calma- digo vendo a imagem do Hector fazendo malabarismo- É só por hoje. - Ta, ta bom. Mas só por hoje!- ela diz se convencendo.- Bom mas eaí quando vai destribuir os convites da festa?Sabe que ta todo mundo esperando né? - Poxa valeu, agora a pressão passou!- digo rindo- Vou distribuir semana que vem,ta bom pra você assim? - Ta, calma!- ela diz rindo. Olho pra televisão,o malabarismo do Ector acabou e agora a professora está apresentando a Bri,ela começa a dançar, eu rio, não porque seja engraçado, mas é que a Brittany mudou muito depois daquilo. Mesmo o Lion e o Hector dizendo que ela continua igualzinha, eu sei que ela está bem diferente, não de aparencia,porque de aparencia ela continua igualzinha,mas sei lá de jeito, eu admito que ela continua paty, escrava da moda e até meio futil,mas eu acho que ela ficou mais corajosa,tipo com a mãe dela, ela antes tinha o maior medo da mãe dela,mas agora ela e o pai dela já impõe mais suas vontades mesmo a mãe sendo contra, eles já conseguiram acabar com muitas daquelas manias chatas dela, Bri sempre diz que agora as coisas estão muito melhor do que a dois anos atrás, me sinto feliz por ela, eu sei como as vezes a Sra. Flune é bem chata. - Então o que você acha?- Bri pergunta, e só então eu percebo que estava voando totalmente. - Desculpa,Bri!Eu voei agora,pode repetir? - Eu não sei que roupa usar na sua festa!É algo mais casual tipo um jeans ou uma coisa mais chique tipo aqueles vestidos de gala? - Acho que um jeans ia ficar muito despojado,mas um vestido de gala é exagero, acho que o melhor seria um vestido,mas não precisa ser de gala. - Algo tipo baile da escola?- ela pergunta. - É.Evita aqueles vestidos tapete vermelho !Ninguém merece ir vestida tipo Oscar quando ta todo mundo tipo Kids Choice Awards ! Ela ri e fala. - Sabe Taylor eu não te intendo, a alguns anos você considerava tudo isso besteira e vestia o que queria e agora você cataloga os tipos de roupa de acordo com as premiações de Holliwood! Eu tinha uma resposta, eu realmente tinha uma resposta,mas ela subtamente sumiu da minha mente quando a minha imagem cantando apareceu na tela da TV. Aquela era eu?É óbvio que era eu, era a minha cara que nem nas fotos, mas sei lá quando eu lembrava daquele momento não parecia tão assim, tão... Sei lá, bobinho! Eu dou pause e corro pra me olhar no espelho de traz da porta. - Hey, eu não to tão diferente assim,to? - Ta sim,Taylor a dois anos atraz você nunca teria falado nada disso, sabe das roupas? - Tenho que ir, sabe pro lugar do salão. - Salva pelo gongo,eim? - Haha- digo com ironia- Tchau. - Tchau. Xxxxx - Ola. – diz minha mãe para mulher do balacão- Viemos fazer a reserva do salão. - Nome?- ela pergunta antes de estourar uma bola gigante de chiclete. - Taylor Fry.- respondo tentando ignorar o jeito irritante como ela bate a caneta na prancheta. - Para que dia querem o salão? - Para daqui umas duas semanas.- minha mãe responde.- Ainda a muito a ser feito. - Sei.- ela diz sem dar importancia- Que tal na quarta? - Quarta?Não tem um dia melhor não?- pergunto ironica- Quarta é no meio da semana!- continuo largando a ironia. - Calma garota!- ela diz finalmente olhando pra nossas caras- Tem domingo se preferir. - Porque não falou logo?!- pergunto um pouco mais esterica do que deveria- Domingo é um dos melhores dias! - Ta calma, qual o seu problema?!- ela pergunta bem mais irritada do que deveria. Minha mãe olha pra mim preocupada. - Só estou com pressa- respondo. - Qual a comemoração?- ela pergunta se virando de novo pra prancheta. - Festa de quinze anos.- minha mãe responde, antes que eu possa dizer qualquer coisa. - Vai fazer quinze anos?- ela pergunta falsamente interessada. Dou o sorriso mais falso do mundo antes de dizer um \"é\" sem muito interesse na conversa. - Ta, então a festa será das cinco as dez.- ela diz se voltando de novo pra prancheta. - De cinco as dez...- começo a falar,mas minha mãe me interrompe. - É um horario exelente!Obrigada. - Voltem na quarta pra acertar a decoração.- ela diz antes de nos virarmos para ir embora. Xxxxx - Ela era o cumulo do mau humor.- digo pra minha mãe assim que entramos no carro. - Você também não ajudou muito,querida.- miha mãe diz. - Tanto faz-digo- agora quem está de mau humor sou eu. Então alguma chance de você me dizer qual é o tal presente surpresa de que o papai falou? - Sem chance,uma surpresa é sempre uma surpresa!Nem tente me convenser porque eu não vou falar! - Mas é uma coisa que eu vá gostar, né?Não é alguma coisa do tempo que vocês eram adolescentes ou algo do tipo? - Não, não é uma coisa velha isso você pode ter certeza! E tenho certeza de que você vai adorar! Olho pela janela e pego meu celular. Penso em ligar pra Brittany,mas mudo de ideia quando me lembro como terminou nossa conversa, disco o numero do Hector, cai na caixa de entrada. Você ligou pro Hector Garcia deixe seu recado depois do sinal. - Hector, é aTaylor, preciso falar com você.Já aluguei o salão para a festa, me ajuda a fazer os convites?Tchau,me liga. Eu desligo. Minha mãe olha pra mim. -Algum problema – ela pergunta. - Não claro que não,estamos chegando? - Estamos sim- ela diz- E parece que sua surpresa já chegou! Olho pela janela e vejo... - Ta me zuando,né?Como você conseguiu? Mamãe estaciona. Eu abro a porta e corro pra dentro de casa. - Cadê?Onde ta pai?- pergunto eufórica. - No seu quarto.-ele responde rindo. Eu corro pro quarto e abro a porta.E lá esta, em cima da cama:a surpresa!

He wants nothing more than to leap up and strangle this asshole with his bare hands, but he fears the consequences, and in his heart, Willard knows that merely strangling his sadistic bastard of a boss will not give him the satisfaction he would get from seeing his rats devour him to the bones. He smiles inwardly at the thought, his eyes gleaming in the harsh light as he allows himself a brief moment of pleasure. One that is rudely interrupted by Mr. Martin kicking his chair out from underneath him. Willard gasps in shock as he lands on the hard floor with an unpleasant jolt, then feels more rage and humiliation building inside him as his co workers start to laugh, enjoying his misfortune, and he feels like a caged animal, being poked at and humiliated by eager gawkers. He quickly scrambles to his feet; face flushed in righteous indignation, then turns and runs out, unable to bear the laughter and mockery any longer. Willard walks off down the street, back to the only creatures that he feels any kinship with, and muses balefully on the fact that he is going from one cage to the next.

Ce qui l'avait frappé immédiatement, ça n'avait mêmenpas été de voir son père mort sur le sol, mais plutôt cette marende sang rouge sombre qui s'étendait sur le plancher. Il s'étaitndemandé, sur le coup, comment une si grande quantité de sang avaitnpu être contenue à l'intérieur d'un seul être humain. Willard avait cherché à hurler mais n'en avait même pas éténcapable. Son cri s'était étranglé dans sa gorge et il avaitnsenti ses jambes faiblir. La seule chose qui l'avait empêché dentomber alors que son champ de vision se constellait d'étoilesnnoires, c'était le cadrage de la porte contre lequel il s'étaitnappuyé en se cachant les yeux derrière ses mains pour ne plus voirnle spectacle qui se présentait à lui. Il avait voulu chasser l'image de son père de son esprit, il avaitnvoulu que tout soit faux et que, au moment où il trouverait ànnouveau la force de voir le monde, cet horrible décor de filmnd'horreur ne soit plus là. Il avait espéré, espéré… mais aunbout d'une longue minute à trembler en silence, faussement ànl'abri dans la noirceur de ses yeux clos, il avait bien dû fairenface à la réalité. Willard avait regardé à nouveau. Le rouge du sang lui avait parunmoins vif, peut-être parce qu'il s'était forcé à y fairenface, mais à présent chaque détail lui sautait aux yeux,nl'agressant et s'imprimant dans son cerveau avec trop de force.nLa façon dont le bord de la mare de sang commençait déjà ànsécher, prenant cette teinte brun rougeâtre. Les plis dans lanchemise de son père et la façon dont le tissu s'était imbibé densang à certains endroits. La façon dont ses cheveux gris,nhabituellement impeccables, étaient ébouriffés dans tous les sens.nSes yeux ouverts, reflétant à peine la lumière terne de la sallende bain. Le canif qu'il tenait à la main et dont le bout de lanlame frôlait tout juste la mare de sang qu'elle avait causée.nTous ces détails… Une faible plainte avait franchi les lèvres de Willard, et il avaitntourné le dos à la scène. Il n'avait pas pu en voir plus. Lanréalité lui avait filé entre les doigts, il s'était dit qu'ilnallait devenir fou s'il continuait de regarder. Il avait comprisnque tout cela était vrai (comment nier ce qui se trouvait là, justenderrière lui?), mais il n'arrivait pas à se l'admettre, à ynfaire face, alors que son esprit s'était mis à énumérer unenaprès l'autre toutes les conséquences que cet acte, cette mortnallait engendrer. Tout ne serait plus pareil, tout allait basculer.nIl s'en remettrait peut-être, bien qu'à cet instant ça lui aitnparu impossible, mais sa mère ne pourrait jamais faire face à ça.nEt ils devraient se battre pour garder la maison, tout faire pour quence vautour de Frank Martin ne leur arrache pas ce qu'il leurnrestait. Willard avait eu du mal à voir comment il ferait pour se battre pournquoi que ce soit, lui qui n'avait jamais été de taille à fairenface à quiconque, et surtout pas Frank Martin. Mais il faudraitnbien… Après cette scène, tout était devenu flou. Il avait perdu contactnavec la réalité pour de bon. Il ne lui restait, de ces derniersnjours, que des images fugaces. Sa mère, en pleurs. Les gens ennuniformes sombres qui étaient venus chercher son père. Martin quinétait passé en vitesse dire des condoléances qui sonnaient faux.nParler à toutes sortes de gens, signer toutes sortes de papiers.nNettoyer la salle de bain, puisqu'il fallait bien que quelqu'unnle fasse. À genoux sur le carrelage, à essayer d'effacer tout censang. Maintenant que Willard commençait à reprendre ses sens (il lenfallait bien, un jour ou l'autre), il ne savait toujours pasncomment il allait faire pour s'en sortir. Son père avait toujoursnpris soin de la famille. C'était lui qui avait travaillé, quinavait mené l'entreprise avec Martin. Willard savait bien qu'ilnaurait toujours un poste à la manufacture, mais avec son maigrensalaire, il peinait à voir comment il pourrait faire vivre nonnseulement lui, mais aussi sa mère. Et puis il détestait Martin…nL'idée de travailler pour cet homme-là lui faisait froid dans lendos depuis toujours, mais tant que son père avait été là, il n'ynavait jamais eu d'ennui. Même avant la mort de son père quinl'avait toujours aidé, Willard avait toujours été incapable denprendre sa place au milieu des autres. Les choses allaient changer maintenant. Enfin… si on voulait. Ilnallait devoir se forcer à continuer. Abandonner son travail n'étaitnplus une option, il devrait s'y raccrocher coûte que coûte. Riennqu'à l'idée de retourner travailler, Willard sentit malgréntout un frisson remonter le long de son dos. Pas le choix. Il étaitnfait comme un rat, pas d'autre option. Comment aurait-il puns'éviter ça? Il lui aurait fallu trouver de l'argent ailleurs,nen quantité suffisante… Mais il ne voyait pas de moyen. En vendantnla maison? C'était impensable, de vendre cette demeure qui étaitnla sienne, cette maison que son père avait tant aimée et oùnlui-même avait vu le jour… Alors qu'il marchait pour se rendre au travail, Willard ne cessaitnde réfléchir. Il avait repris ses esprits, il pouvait retournerntravailler, et de toute façon il n'avait pas tellement le choix.nMais sa mère, elle… Elle n'allait pas mieux. Elle était…ncomment dire? Déconnectée? Elle n'écoutait rien, et lorsqu'ilnlui parlait, Willard sentait bien qu'elle n'avait pas le cœur ànl'entendre. Hier soir, il l'avait entendue marmonner pournelle-même, et les paroles qu'il avait cru entendre ne lui avaitnparues faire de sens. Déjà qu'elle n'avait pas été au sommetnde sa forme avant toute cette histoire de suicide! Son espritndéraillait un peu, de temps en temps, rien de flagrant, mais quandnmême… Maintenant, elle descendait la pente à une vitessenaccablante. Et ce serait à lui de veiller sur elle si elle ne senremettait jamais, et il ne voyait pas comment il pourrait y arriver. Il regarda sa montre et grimaça. Il était en retard au travail. Ilnavait essayé de se dépêcher pourtant! Les minutes avaient dûnfiler quelque part, mais il ne savait pas où. À vrai dire, depuis ces derniers jours Willard avait l'impressionnd'être dépassé par les évènement. Il sentait un étau senrefermer sur lui, quelque chose qui l'étranglait. Trop denresponsabilités en même temps, trop de choses à gérer dont il nensavait presque rien, trop de brouillard dans sa tête, trop… dentout. Trop de douleur, trop de choses qu'il voulait ne plus voir,ntrop à supporter. Il ne lui manquait qu'une seule chose : le temps. Le temps, et peut-être… peut-être quelqu'un. Il ne voyait pasnqui, il n'avait jamais eu personne d'autre que ses parents surnqui compter. Non pas qu'ils aient été les parents les plusnaimants du monde, c'était des gens plutôt froid, mais Willard lesnaimait de tout son cœur et avait toujours pu compter sur eux.nMaintenant qu'ils n'étaient plus en mesure de l'aider, toutnétait différent. Au fond de lui-même, Willard se surprenaitnparfois à souhaiter avoir un ami sur qui compter. Quelqu'un.nN'importe qui. N'importe quoi. Mais il ne savait pas se lier auxnautres, Willard avait fini par l'apprendre, depuis le temps. Lesngens le mettaient mal à l'aise, il n'arrivait pas à placer unnmot, il n'arrivait pas à faire confiance. Il n'avait jamais sunse faire d'amis, et à présent, il se retrouvait seul contre lenmonde entier. Le monde entier… et surtout Frank Martin.

Madmartigan brushed his luscious brown hair over his shoulder as he brought his horse to a halt. Something was wrong. \"Something's not right,\" he told his horse. \"Stay here and DON'T WHINNY.\" The horse shook off his gentle caress, as Madmartigan looked deeply into his eyes. He cared deeply about that horse, too deeply for words. Instead of attempting to explain, he turned, drew his sword, and crept into the darkness of the haze as silently as a ninja. He'd taken barely ten steps before he could no longer see the sun. Brushing up against a thatched cottage, he kept his back pressed against the wall, sword at the ready. He could see some dark shapes moving in the distance. Taking the advantage of surprise, he tucked and rolled out in front of them, quickly grabbing the nearest and pressing his blade against their throat. \"Madmartigan? Is that you?\" a familiar voice gurgled. \"Madmartigan, put the sword DOWN! I'm unarmed!\" It took him a moment to place the voice, but it explained why the man he'd grabbed was so near to the ground. It was Willow, his dwarf friend. \"Willow! My dwarf friend! I'm so glad to see you!\" Madmartigan embraced Willow tightly, then held him back for a good look. \"Let me get a good look at you!\" Madmartigan stared deeply into Willow's eyes, seeing there the grand adventure they had once shared. \"Madmartigan, are you okay? You're making me uncomfortable.\" \"Willow, something terrible has happened here!\" \"I know, I was here. There was a witch!\" \"A witch?\" \"She turned all of the villagers into mice!\" \"Well, can't you turn them back?\" \"She took my wand!\" \"Well, we'll have to go find you one, then… Do you know where we can find a wand?\" Madmartigan stood decisively, but didn't take a step in any direction. Just then, a mouse scurried towards them and up Willow's leg. Willow giggled. \"Help me, Madmartigan!\" \"It's just a mouse.\" But Madmartigan gamely slapped at Willow's body, not managing to swat off the mouse. The mouse hopped up on Willow's left shoulder and leaned in towards his ear. Willow giggled again as it tickled. \"He needs you to go to the Castle of Blackthorn to retrieve it.\" \"Me? What about you?\" \"I have to stay here and make sure none of them get squished. They think a dwarf knows more about being stepped on than a giant like you.\" \"Ah. Of course.\" \"Good luck, Madmartigan!\" Madmartigan looked deeply into the eyes of the mouse. \"I will find you the wand you need.\" And then he was off. With no thought of the dangers he would face, Madmartigan rode off in the direction of Castle Blackthorn, his trust steed racing like the wind. But as he felt the sun on his face once again, it occurred to him that he was needlessly putting his own life in danger. \"I have more important things to do,\" he told himself. \"Even if I found the sword, Willow probably couldn't use it. They'll figure a way out of the mess on their own.\" So he jerked the reigns towards the East, the direction of his favorite tavern. \"I'll send them a message when I get there,\" he reassured himself. When he reached the pub, he tied up his horse. He patted its nose, and told him \"If you hear that anyone is looking for me… anyone… sound the alarm.\" As he strode into the tavern and slapped down a few coins for a mug of ale, he noticed a bit of movement to the serving girl's curly blonde hair. Grabbing her to him quickly, he managed to grab both of the brownies hiding in her hair. They moaned and groaned as Madmartigan plunked them on the counter, then scurried away. \"You appear to have some unusually large lice.\" He told her. She stepped back, flustered, as he released her. \"Have we met before?\" he asked her, leaning towards her again. She tripped as she continued to step backwards, away from him. \"I'm Madmartigan,\" he told her. \"Deirdre. No, we don't know each other.\" \"If we don't know each other, why are you so anxious to get away from me?\" He smiled and looked deeply into her eyes. \"I-ah-I I just am!\" She dropped her tray entirely and retreated behind the bar. \"I'm not going to hurt you.\" Madmartigan heaved himself over the bar so he could continue looking at her. \"Go away!\" \"Well, fine. But I'd like my beer.\" Madmartigan leaned over her and poured himself a tankard of ale. He retreated across the room to an empty table, and watched, as Deidre peeked her head out around the corner of the bar. He waved. Frustrated, she marched over to him. Pulling out a kitchen knife, she asked him politely, \"Can you please leave?\" \"Not unless you tell me why you dislike me so much.\" She huffed a little, \"Fine! …It's your reputation. I don't want you sullying this tavern.\" \"It's a tavern. It's supposed to be sullied. And my reputation is, at the moment, spotless. I'm a hero of the realm, I was happily married until my wife was assassinated, and I have yet to kill anyone in retribution. My reputation is beyond reproach.\" \"I don't want to soliders who stop here to think my ale can turn you yellow. You're well-known as a coward, and the lack of avenging your wife's death proves it!\" Madmartigan effortlessly disarmed Deirdre. \"Don't make me angry enough to prove you wrong. All right, I'll leave. I don't want any trouble.\" He chugged his beer and turned towards the door. But behind it, an eerie glow was spreading. \"Do you have a back way out of here?\" Deidre shook her head no. \"Well, then we're going to have to get creative.\" Madmartigan pulled her into the tavern's back room and sized her up. \"You'll do. Stand right there.\" With a quick leap, he hopped onto the table, then to Deirdre's shoulders. \"Hold my legs steady.\" He began hacking at the roof, trying to make a hole. \"What are you doing to my tavern?!\" Deirdre screeched. But by this time, Madmartigan was already pulling himself up through the thatch. \"Your tavern?\" he asked her. \"What happened to Roland?\" \"My father died.\" \"I'm sorry. Look, let me give you a hand up.\" \"No!\" \"It's that or become a mouse, I'm afraid. Your choice.\" With a backwards glance, Deidre reached up to Madmartigan, and was pulled through the roof before she could even see who had entered behind her. Madmartigan quickly shifted some of the thatch back over the hole. He looked over at Deirdre, warning her with his eyes that she needed to be absolutely still. Below them, they heard the clank of metal on metal as several soldiers shuffled into the room. \"There's no one here!\" one called out. But there was a swish of skirts and some eerie light, and Madmartigan recognized the voice that spoke, \"They can't have gotten far.\" It was Bavmorda! Deirdre gasped, giving away their position. Madmartigan grabbed her hand and they slid off of the roof, and the soldiers ran outside. Falling to the ground, Deirdre stumbled, twisting her ankle. With a single glance, Madmartigan knew what had gone wrong. He swept her over his shoulder and ran as fast as he could. The soldiers set fire to the tavern and Deirdre hit his back with her fists as hard as she could to no avail. \"My home is burning down! Let me go!\" \"There's nothing you can do there except let the Queen torture you for information.\" \"The Queen is dead!\" \"It doesn't look that way. Now stop squirming!\" \"Where are you taking me?\" \"To my horse. Then to Castle Blackthorn. There's only one thing she could be after.\" Madmartigan could see Castle Blackthorn over the ridge. It was in ruins, and surrounded by a thorny hedge that had grown around it over the years. He woke Deirdre up by gently shaking her. \"Where are we?\" \"Castle Blackthorn. I need to get a wand for Willow.\" \"We're going in there?\" \"I'm going in there. You're staying with the horse.\" Deirdre huffed a little at this, but Madmartigan was off walking towards the castle too quickly for her to say anything. As he crossed over the ridge, though, he found himself under attack by a band of knights. Drawing his sword, he parried and thrust, knocking arms and legs and heads to the ground, only to look around and realize there were no people inside them. …And they were slowly pulling themselves back together. \"This must be black magic.\" He told himself. He knocked them to the ground once more and kicked the helmets as far away as he could. Then he ran towards the castle as they began pulling themselves together again. When he reached the castle, he started hacking at the thorny brush with his sword, glancing over his shoulder to see how far off the hollow knights were. He increased his speed to no avail. No matter how hard he chopped, the thorns simply refused to be cut. On closer examination, he realized they were smoke-blackened metal, and not a plant at all. Behind him, he could see that the hollow knights had collected themselves and were now lumbering towards him again. Madmartigan steeled himself for capture, but out of nowhere, Deirdre appeared on the horse, riding behind the hollow knights and holding out a long stick that stuck out on either side. As she passed the knights, they were knocked to the ground in a mix of parts. Reaching Madmartigan, she stuck the end of the pole in the ground and vaulted herself over the thorns. After a brief moment of dumbfoundedness, Madmartigan hopped on the horse and circled around holding the pole. He built up a good amount of speed and followed her example, vaulting over the thorns, turning mid-air to wave his horse away from the hollow knights. This action allowed him to neatly slip by an errant branch of thorns and break his fall on a barrel of wine. Wet and surprised, he sputtered, as he heard laughter above him. Deirdre had been caught by the thorns and hung twenty feet in the air, unable to release their hold on her. \"You're one to laugh,\" he told her, grouchily. \"At least you had the sense to land in good spirits.\" \"Ha.\" \"Can you get me down?\" Madmartigan looked around for a tool, but the pole had unfortunately stayed on the other side of the wall. Spying a catapult, however, he wheeled it into position directly underneath Deirdre, and loaded it with a bag of grain. \"You're not going to…\" But before Deirdre could finish, Madmartigan launched the catapult, knocking Deirdre off the branch. As she fell, Madmartigan positioned himself below to catch her. She fell into his arms, and for a brief moment, Madmartigan smiled, until the bag of grain clobbered them both. They fell to the ground with a thud, and the bag burst open. Madmartigan sneezed… it wasn't grain at all. It was fairy dust, pounds and pounds of it, now coating Madmartigan and Deirdre from head to toe. They stood up in a daze. \"Are you…\" Deirdre began. \"Feeling what I'm feeling?\" Madmartigan finished her sentence. \"I feel... amazing! And you… your beauty overwhelms me! Your skin is radiant like the sun! And the moon! And the stars! … Wait a moment, have I said these words before? I don't care. I love you, Deirdre. You are my everything.\" He gazed deeply into her eyes. Deirdre said nothing, simply wrapping her hands in Madmartigan's lustrous mane of chestnut hair and kissing him. Suddenly, a wave of water crashed over them from above. They sputtered and leapt back from each other. \"What was that?!\" shrieked Deirdre. \"Why were you kissing me?!\" \"You were kissing me!\" \"I would NEVER kiss you, Madmartigan!\" Above them, several brownies tittered, amused at having dumped cold water all over them. When Madmartigan looked up at them, furious, they scattered. \"Brownies!\" Madmartigan raced up the stairs to the parapet. When he reached the landing, several of the Brownies jumped off the edge, landing securely on more bags of fairy dust, and sending up small clouds of dust. Deirdre backed away and covered her mouth and nose. \"Madmartigan!\" she yelled up to him. \"This whole place is full of fairy dust! Don't breathe!\" It was too late. Madmartigan took one breath, and filled his lungs with fairy dust. He coughed uncontrollably, and stared deeply into the eyes of half a dozen brownies before falling off the edge of the parapet. Deirdre ran to see if he was ok. \"These brownies are amazing!\" he told her. \"I love brownies!\" \"Oh, not again!\" Deirdre grabbed him by his shirt collar and looked around for more water. There was none to be found. \"Well, it has to wear off eventually…\" She dragged him towards the castle. \"Maybe there's water in here.\" She glared up at the brownies. \"If you think you don't like him when he's chasing after you with a sword, I promise you that you'll like him less when he's kissing you!\" \"I have to tell the brownies about my feelings, Deirdre. The way my soul longs for them …they are my other half.\" One of the brownies approached. They told Deirdre they didn't have another bucket of water to dump on Madmartigan, but that dousing him in flame would have a similar effect. \"We're not magical, you silly thing! Flame will burn us!\" So much for the Brownies' help, she thought to herself. However, her response only excited the Brownies further. They poked her and Madmartigan in the ankles with their tiny spears, herding them into the castle's grand hall. In the center of the hall, under a glass bell, a gnarled metal wand that matched the metal thorns surrounding the castle stood. It was inlaid with rubies to look like drops of blood. The Brownies pushed Madmartigan and Deirdre towards the wand. \"Madmartigan… is this the wand we're looking for?\" \"No,\" said a woman's voice from across the room. \"It's the wand I am looking for!\" Bavmorda stood triumphantly near the throne. \"With this wand, I can undo this castle's curse, and reign anew! I'll ignore that hovel of a castle Elora is living in. I don't need it! My power will be so great, she can do nothing to me now!\" \"Bavmorda!\" Deirdre spit out. \"You're dead!\" \"I was never dead, just banished to the netherworld. Ask your dear Madmartigan. And now I'm unbanished. See?\" She smiled and raised her arms, lifting the glass bell off the wand magically. \"Nooo!\" Deirdre grabbed the wand just in time. Bavmorda attempted to magically yank it from her, but Madmartigan wrapped his arms around her and held onto the wand as well. They closed their eyes as Bavmorda's magic slowly dragged them closer to her. Suddenly, Bavmorda screamed! \"What are you doing to me!\" They opened their eyes. Bavmorda was changing! Deirdre and Madmartigan dropped the wand, but the process had already begun. Bavmorda's head elongated, and torso expanded rapidly. Her skin turned green and then scaley. \"Oh yes,\" she growled, \"This will do nicely.\" Her dragon form filled most of the hall. Her eyes looked evil. She looked at Deirdre, who was scrabbling to grab the wand, and took a deep breath. As she spouted flame towards Deirdre, Madmartigan knocked her out of the way and grabbed the wand, only to be caught in the flame himself. \"Madmartigan!\" screamed Deirdre! But as the flames licked Madmartigan, golden fairy dust jumped off of his person and became a shimmering golden armor, feeding up to his hand holding the wand. When Bavmorda stopped, Madmartigan pointed the wand directly at her, and the fairy dust flew in her direction, shrinking her down and turning her back into a spirit. She howled as she was banished again into the Netherworld. The rest of the fairy dust in and around the castle flew up in the air, and as it floated down on the metal thorns, they dissolved. Fin Raziel rode in through the gates with a host of soldiers – no longer hollow - flanking her. \"I found these soldiers outside. ","Summary":" A grey haze rose in the distance.

Smith","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3576334","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I never wanted it to be this way... You have to believe that! I was just lonely, and I wanted my friends... But I got selfish. It's so easy to see now. Now that I'm standing here, looking out at what used to be the rookery in the back yard. It's apartments here now, just like Martin always wanted. It doesn't matter that I killed him... The world is filled with Martins, who say they're on the side of progress. What's progress, other than the death of old ways? I want my house back... I know I didn't keep it well, but Mother made me so angry sometimes and... It just didn't seem worth it, back then. I know better, now that it's much too late. There's new tenants in here again. It's hard for them to keep this specific apartment occupied. It's just about where Father's study in the cupola used to be... They built a kitchen where the window was... The window that I died in. I can move things a little when I'm angry enough, and once again I'm furious at what a waste it all was! I pull all the pots and pans onto the floor, waking up the little family with a start. I'm always moody like this at around 10 or 11 o'clock at night... Around the time I died. I don't think the Realtor ever mentions me when he brings prospective tenants in to inspect the place. I do my best to spook them at the outset, so I can have at least one place on my property to myself. Especially since I haven't been able to leave in decades. Before they rebuilt everything, I could still take walks around the rookery. Now I can't even step outside without fading to a point of discomfort. It just isn't fair! I spent almost my whole life being invisible, and I'm still stuck here, with no one to see me. And the rats... There are none left of the generation who knew me, which may well be for the best. Ben was very angry when he killed me, and after I'd been dead long enough to realize what was going on, I could see clearly how I'd treated him just like Martin treated me. It wasn't right... I wasn't right, in thought or action, and I hadn't been for a long time. I try to stay out of the way while this Mom cleans up her dishes. It feels strange to be walked through, and I don't particularly like it. It happens fairly often too, especially when I'm just trying to mind my own business. It's strange, because when I'm alone, the room goes back to looking just like Father's study. I can sit in his chair and leaf through the papers at his desk. It's comforting in its own way. But as soon as someone enters the room, the present forces itself on me, and I find myself floating on nothing at about the height of Father's chair. Which in the new design leaves me knee-deep in the floor. It makes me wander around angrily for a while every time that happens, and the people living in my space tend to get chills when I walk by. It makes me wonder why I've stayed here... While I was alive I was under the impression ghosts weren't real to begin with, and that even if they were they had unfinished business to attend to. I thought that I'd accomplished all my dreams with the help of the rats, but apparently this wasn't the case. Sometimes I spend so long just thinking, trying to piece together why I'm still around, that a new family can get full settled before I even know they're here. It makes me angry that people are always bothering me... I just want to be left alone! I've always wanted to just be left alone, to have my house and my friends the rats and... And it all went wrong, even when I did have things my way. I knock all the books off the shelves in the living room and sit grouchily on one of the new family's chairs. Or at least, I sit on the air in the vicinity of the chair. For some reason, even after years of being insubstantial, I always feel better when I'm using a piece of furniture. This time, it isn't a timid-looking housewife who emerges from what they've made the bedroom area, but a girl who looks about the age I was when I died. \"God damn! I know there wasn't an earthquake, so what the f--\" I'm surprised when she stops short. For some reason it feels like she's looking right at me. \"Oh. I guess you knocked over my books, then, Mr. Ghost.\" What the hell?! Is this woman seriously speaking to me calmly ? As if it's the most natural thing in the world for a ghost to be sitting as well as it can on your furniture? \"You can really see me?\" I ask her lamely as she reorganizes her books. \"Yeah, plain as day. What you're lucky about is the fact that I can hear you too. A lot of psychics have real trouble with that... 'S where you get automatic writers from: their ears are just too filled with everyday life.\" She nods in approval at her books and sits in a chair opposite me. I'm agog... It's the only word I can think of to fit this strange awe. I've never had a conversation sound this natural in my entire existence! And I've been dead for at least thirty years! \"Wow. I thought I'd just have to wander alone, knocking things over for however long I'm here,\" I sort of joke with her. She grins. \"Not as long as I'm here, pal!\" she tells me cheerfully. \"My name's Gracie, and I'd ask to shake your hand but I don't think you're that sort of ghost.\" I chuckle, the first time in God only knows how long. \"No, I'm really not... I've barely got the hang of sweeping things off shelves. My name's Willard... This used to be my family homestead,\" I sigh a little. It's strange talking without any air... Sometimes I still feel like I'm breathing, even though I know I can't. \"Ah, the old Stiles estate, right? Never got to see it in person, but I saw pictures, and heard stories...\" she just sort of trailed off. So she knew who I was, apparently. That could put a real damper on things. Still, no sense in being anything but honest. \"Most of 'em are probably true, I'm afraid. I wasn't well by the time my life ended...\" If I still had eyes, they would've glazed with the memories. \"But the rats were my only friends... I just wanted them to go away, so the health department people wouldn't kill them all...\" I shake my head to take myself out of it. For some reason, a lock of my hair still falls in my eyes from time to time. To me, it still looks like the blond curl it had always been, but I can only imagine what I must look like to her. I clear my throat and move my hair out of my eyes, two very old habits that are dying harder than I did, as I apologize. \"I didn't mean to startle you, really. I just get angry when it's evening... Plus I'd been so busy thinking for, I guess a few months there, that I didn't even notice you move in. It upsets me when I don't get to meet my, erm, new roommates on their first day.\" She smiles a little at me. \"Don't worry, I never keep a consistent sleep-pattern when I can help it. Besides, I'd heard from my cousin that something weird had been going on here, and I wanted to find out what it was. I didn't expect you to be this amicable or easy to find, Willard, but I was hoping to at least meet you.\" I feel good for the first time since I last held Socrates! Someone came here looking to meet me ! I never thought anything like that would happen to me... I thought I'd just be a legend that died out as soon as the house was gone. Sure, while it was still my house, and for legal purposes abandoned, the children would run to the other side of the street, or dare each other to touch the door, or ring the doorbell. One summer a young junior high student was dared to stay the night inside... I remember it well, because I did everything I could not to scare the poor boy. He was trembling enough at it was... but this! \"I'm honored...\" is all I can think to tell her as she stands to leave. She giggles at me. \"Oh, don't be silly! I'm the one who's honored! You're my hero, Willard! But for right now, I need to get some sleep for my exams tomorrow. I'll see you bright and early, alright?\" It wasn't so much a question or an invitation as a statement that her feelings would be hurt if I weren't here to tell her good morning. \"Of course, this is my... uh, haunt, after all.\" My humor was notoriously bad while I was alive... I don't think death's done much good for it. But miraculously, she chuckles. \"Just promise me one thing...\" \"Sure Gracie, anything you want.\" Perhaps I was a little too quick with that answer... But I can't help liking someone who declared me of all people their hero. \"Stay outta my bedroom, alright?\" She flashes me a sort of impish grin as she disappears down the short hallway. She doesn't even leave me time to answer, but I do anyway. It feels good to talk again after so long... \"Anything you want, Gracie... Anything .\" ((A/N: It's not really supposed to be a romance story, but I'll admit it is sort of leaning that way .

Also, it won't make much sense if you haven't seen it) (Just my explanation to where the white rat in the end came from, and what her connection was to the first Socrates) She hadn't been in the house when her brother first met him. She got the news when she came to visit, some days later, and their mother had that expression on her nose, the same one of when she started stalking the humans in the library, when she started behaving strangely for her kind. Seemed like it was in the family… She followed his scent up to the part of the house she never had been to, into the man's room, and then she had found herself staring jaw open. Her brother was peacefully slumbering on the pillow, close to the sleeping man's face, the man's hand next to him like he had fallen asleep cradling the little rat. She had behaved strangely… but damn, he had burnt the ground! He opened his eyes at her soft call, and immediately beamed, he ran off the bed and joined her in the wardrobe where the two siblings cuddled and rolled together, happy to see each other again. They both were completely white, and if not for their slightly different smell they looked like perfect copycats to every other rat but their own mother, not to mention the humans. He had told her about the glue trap, and how the man, at the beginning set on killing him, had then freed him, taken care of him and even given him and the family some food. He had even given him a human name! She knew the sound of it, thanks to her listening to humans, and she explained him that Socrates was a man who lived Long Ago, a very wise one, always questioning and trying to get the best out of people. Socrates, as she was happy to call him now, since he liked it, had been proud of it. He explained his sister that the man was alone, he had no Family, he needed someone to take care of him like of a little one, and Socrates wanted to. Not out of gratitude, obviously. If the man hadn't settled the trap, he wouldn't have needed to be rescued, after all. He just wanted to. His sister wasn't sure she understood, but she nuzzled him, and told him to do what he felt right. He mocked her for talking like their mother, and she immediately tackled, the two rats wrestled playfully for a little till a snort warned them the man was waking up, so she ran away and Socrates went back to him. She didn't thought anything of this was too weird, she was just happy her brother found someone to care for, and who could feed him, and she went back to her library. But rats are pessimistic by nature, and even if she liked to behave like the rare ecception her brother really was, in the deep of herself she wasn't too surprised when things suddenly started rotting away fast. As soon as the man decided to use the other rats for… complicated things, Socrates told their mother and other sister to leave the place, a wise decision. She saw him again only another time. Socrates told her the man needed him more than ever before. He wanted to fix things between the other rats too: Big Ben (that was the name the man gave to the big and bullying rat usually terrifying everybody else) had started behaving like the leader, carrying the rats to raid and own the house in full sunlight, and when rats found themselves following a leader, something they were not prone to, it was always an ugly moment, usually ending bad. He had asked Ben to follow him to the place the man went everyday out of the house, so they could talk. She asked what he planned to do if Ben wanted to fight, he couldn't stand a chance, and Socrates replied Ben was jealous of the man's affection. He wouldn't dare hurt him, for that would mean the man would hate him. What Ben didn't know was the man already hated him, like everybody else in the world but the white rat… Socrates hoped the big rat would never find out. Anyway, that meant he was safe, and he really believed he could persuade Ben to leave and bring the others away... yet, was nervous, he couldn't hide it to his sister. When they parted, he asked her if she would look after his human, in the future. Just in case… things got even more complicated. Complicated as the humans, and the rats who tried behaving like humans, always made them. She promised. She never saw him again. She walks and crawls through the conductures of the white and dirty place, trying hard to recognize the trace between all the ugly smells, the chemical ones, and the madness ones. She peeks into so many rooms, listens and sniffs, she avoids the other few rats. They probably won't be interested, but the tale about the man spreaded fast as rats running from a fire, and even if it lasted only some days in the memory of the most, some could still be curious. He was basically dead, and yet he stood up and killed the self-proclaimed leader (of course now nobody said they were actually following Ben's orders…) bare-handed. She doubts of the last part, but at least he hadn't used the bad air, or anything humans usually did, and that gained him enough respect they let him out of there alive. Well, really, no reason why they shouldn't, but following some crazy rat's will: rats don't seek for revenge, and eating humans brings only troubles. So they went away, left him the house… and he had been taken away by other humans. He is alone again. She stands frozen, at the sudden familiar scent, so feeble she dares not to sniff too hard, then she quickly follows it, running so fast she stumbles on her paws, hits the tube walls with her sides, fast, faster, till she's in the light again, she blinks and looks around, confused, and then she recognizes him. He's laying on the small bed, eyes closed, breath laboured like he's prisoner of a bad dream. She climbs on the blanket and slowly moves close to his face, scarred by bites. She calls softly. His eyes opens suddenly, rageful, and before she can move he has caught her into his hand, squeezing so hard she squeals high in pain… and then he stops. The fingers loosen to a gentle hold, and he looks at her with wide eyes, mouth opening in a silent gasp. \"…Socrates… Socrates, is it you? Oh god… I thought you were… you were… I'm sorry, Socrates, did I hurt you? I'm so sorry…\" He straightens up to a sitting positing, while cradling her into his shaking hands, petting her lovingly. \"You came back to me… Socrates… oh, how I missed you… I'm so sorry for what has happened… but now we're together again… Socrates… my friend… everything will be all right\" he is smiling now, a thin, stretched smile broken by sobs, haunted by feverish eyes, but he's smiling. He brings the white rat up to his face and kisses her head, nuzzles her, tears wetting her fur. Socrates squeals softly, nuzzling back, as to tell the man that yes, everything is all right now.

Also the first fic where the plot bunnies are running wild. This story demanded to be written and I just could not stop typing until the first chapter was done. If it stays this way, then this is going to take priority over all the other stuff I'm supposed to be working on. I'm kind of combining elements from both the book and the movie Willard , but mostly I will be sticking with the movie version. Reviews are always welcome of course! And hopefully my OC characters (they are many of them) turn out well developed. Disclaimer: I do not own the book or the film Willard or any of the characters. I just like playing with them. ;P I'm taking a leaf out of another author's book and saying I will not repost this disclaimer for each chapter as it covers the entire story. Enjoy! Chapter I It was easy, at first, to get my hands on the hydrocodone pills. I had an extra bottle in my room left over from some procedure or other. But they didn't last long, even when I limited myself to three or four a day. I knew it was wrong, but simply didn't care. It was worth it for that feeling. Like a warm fuzzy feeling that spread from the back of the throat. It was synthetic love; rose-colored glasses. Or almost. It made it easy to ignore the loneliness. I knew what I should be feeling, but I didn't feel. Sometimes I wondered if my professors realized when they looked at me that I was popping pills . Then I remembered that they probably wouldn't care. It wasn't high school; they didn't keep tabs on students. We were adults and free to act as responsible or as reckless as we chose. Around the time I had to resort to making up excuses as to why I needed pain meds, I realized it was getting out of hand. My grades were dropping, sleep was impossible, and not a day passed when I didn't fantasize about just walking in front of rush hour traffic. I had been here before and was lucky it hadn't turned out worse. A third chance seemed like too much to ask for. So, I waited until the semester was over and looked for a place to stay. I didn't know what I needed. Antidepressant? Someone to talk to? I was just hoping to regain control. To be who I was before: happy, imaginative, and full of laughter. I really missed that girl. I joined the other patients in the cafeteria at exactly 12 o'clock. A half hour was given to eat before we were sent back to our rooms. Then, it was time for individual therapy for most. Always perfectly scheduled. Living by the clock was the first thing I hated about this place. I never wanted my days scheduled so meticulously. But then again, I thought, maybe structure would be better for me. Maybe that's what I was missing. The food wasn't bad: chopped turkey, dressing from a box, and a roll. The green beans I wouldn't touch, no matter how much the cafeteria lady coaxed me. I just politely replied that they could give me a multivitamin if my health was such a big concern. After filling, my tray, there was the business of finding a place to sit. It reminded me of high school. If you didn't already have someone to latch onto, you were pretty much screwed. The best option was to sit alone and let others come to you. So, I made a beeline for the most open space of the tables. At least they were clean, if not comfortable. The chairs were really just stools attached to the tables that stretched halfway across the cafeteria in several rows. A long space was left in the middle for heavy traffic. I unwrapped my plastic spork (no knives or forks here - considered too dangerous I guessed) and began to eat my lunch. The one good thing about the university had been that I could pay for the food and take it to the dorm or outside on the benches. At least that way the aloneness was private. Here it was on display for anyone to see. I stared at the multicolored waves painted on the walls as if they were completely fascinating, and people ate alone everyday, and I was completely used to it. But if I had been preoccupied with chatter, I wouldn't have noticed the man who was lead into the cafeteria. He was tall and thin and his face looked like it had been ravished by some disease. Pale and waxy. His hair was limp, grimy, and dark. The circles beneath his eyes were very pronounced. And his eyes were just blank. They slid over the world like water, never latching onto anything. He looked like he truly belonged here, and I admit that he frightened me quite a bit. My nerves increased when \"Alfred\" (according to his staff nametag) sat him on a stool near me. \"You wait here, Willard,\" he said, \"while I go get a plate.\" The man, Willard,he had called him, never even moved in response. The only thing that even distinguished him from the dead was the fact that he could support himself and his heavy, strained breathing. Wondering briefly if maybe he was catatonic or something, I averted my eyes. Those on the staff who walked by either paid him no mind or wore a look of distaste. At first, I hadn't noticed, but a guard had entered the building at the same time and continued to stand near our table. Was this man a danger to others? Or was it just a coincidence? I couldn't help but stare at him some more. The combination of his breathing and the tautness of his muscles gave him a look of a cornered animal. At any moment he could break from his restraint and attack. His body curled in on itself, as if he were afraid. \"All right, here's your plate.\" Alfred set it in front of Willard. When he didn't respond, the nurse huffed and sat down beside him. \"You don't want to be put back on the feeding tube do you, Willard? That's what they'll do if you don't eat, you know. And don't act like you can't hear what I'm saying, 'cause we both know you can.\" His words were stern, but his voice remained gentle. Ever so slowly, as if his limbs were uncooperative, Willard took his utensil and ate a few tiny bites. Alfred turned to face me and smiled warmly. \"You new here? I haven't seen you before.\" \"I just got here yesterday,\" I replied with a smile of my own. I liked this man instantly. His voice and his dark mustache reminded me of Gary Oldman. The thought made my smile widen. \"You can call me Al. You'll probably see me around quite a bit. My shifts change a lot, and I get to know most of the patients pretty well. You seem like a nice and normal gal. What are you in for?\" The question took me back a bit. But he was chatty and frank. I liked that. \"Depression. Suicidal thoughts.\" I shrugged. \"Mmmm…just as I thought. Nice and normal,\" he laughed. I quirked an eyebrow, wondering if he was being sarcastic. \"I haven't met a person yet who hasn't been depressed or thought about suicide. I figure it won't be long before they release you.\" \"I hope so. No offense, but I don't think I want to stay in here any longer than I have to.\" He chuckled, \"Don't worry. None taken.\" I was beginning to feel really relaxed when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Willard glance at me. It wasn't a casual action; it was as fast as a snake striking, and that's what I felt like had happened. His eyes were such a cold and pale blue, even a look as brief as that made me shiver. It was very hard to pretend I hadn't noticed. \"So have you gotten all settled in your room yet?\" Al asked. \"Um…yeah,\" I answered lamely, trying to get my mind back on the conversation. \"Do you like your roommate?\" \"Actually, I don't have one at the moment. They said I probably would later. But I'm glad to take advantage of the privacy while I can.\" \"Yeah. That's one thing you lose staying here. But who said being healthy was easy? Has anyone showed you around?\" \"No. Just the common room and here. We went over the rules. What time to eat and sleep and breathe, \" I said wryly. \"You'll get used to it. If you want I can show you around after I take Willard back to his room. I get a break after that. I'm sure it'll be all right.\" He looked at me expectantly. Suppose it's best to take a friendly hand whenever you can. I told him I'd be happy to meet him in the common room in a few minutes and took my tray back to the kitchen. When I passed Alfred and Willard on the way out, I caught the former nagging, \"Well I suppose half eaten is better none.\" Ten minutes later, I was dutifully waiting for my new escort in the common room. A rerun of The Cosby Show was playing on the small television set, and there were quite a few people sitting on the leather couches and chairs. Sunlight shone through the large barless windows, and plants made the area more cheerful. It was better than the individual rooms. The furniture in my room consisted of two brown laminate beds and the desks and drawers to match. The walls were a pale green. Perhaps they had springtime in mind when they chose the color, but it made me think of vomit instead. The barred windows I would never get used to. When I saw them my chest instantly tightened up with claustrophobia. Surely it was bad for the psyche to have the spooky thought that you could never leave? Cheerful whistling drifted from down the hall and into my thoughts. That was definitely Alfred coming to fetch me. We had only just met, but I felt like I knew him well already. Or it could be my desperation for company. But when he turned the corner, thus proving me right, I changed my mind. \"Hey again,\" he greeted me enthusiastically. \"Ready?\" I nodded and left my comfy chair to join him by the nurses' station. \"Roxie,\" he addressed the woman behind the counter, who was currently filing her nails, \"I'd like to go ahead and show our newcomer around the building, if that's all right.\" Roxie, a red-haired, red-lipped woman who looked to be in her mid- to late-forties, looked up from her nails and smirked coquettishly up at Al. \"Sure, honey, so long as you watch after her. It's Ember, yeah?\" she turned to me. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Waving her hand dismissively, she said, \"No, no, sweetie, none of that ma'am business. You just call me Roxie. Welcome to Bellevue - finest luxury hotel in town.\" Her laugh was loud and vivacious. I smiled shyly and muttered a thanks. \"C'mon, kid,\" Al said, with his hand steering me by the shoulder. \"Be seeing you, Roxie.\" \"You better soon, honey,\" she called out after us. \"Roxie seems to be pretty fond of you,\" I mentioned slyly, as soon as we were out of earshot. \"Oh, she's like that with everyone,\" Al replied nonchalantly, but I noticed a red tinge appeared on his ears. We viewed the music room first. Although the one instrument I had ever played had been the clarinet, and that was years ago, it was exciting to think I could learn to play something new. It would be something to focus on, anyway. \"The instruments are all worn, but they still work just fine. There's a music therapist who supervises and does different group activities. Some of them are a little hokey, but they rather everyone participate,\" he explained, as I ran my fingers along the battered keys of the baby grand piano. An instructor also taught yoga and Pilates classes in the recreational room. \"They thought about putting in a pool, but I'm not sure what happened to that plan,\" Al told me. \"Probably didn't have the funds.\" \"A pool would be nice, providing it was inside\" I mused. I didn't get to swim as often as I liked, only a few times each summer. Yoga would be interesting, but I didn't know if I would be able to stretch my body into such awkward positions with people watching. But, around the perimeter of the room was a track walkway. That was something I used to love. Thank heavens they let me keep my mp3 player, even if they confiscated my phone. \"And here,\" Al said as unlocking the last door, \"is the art room. Guests have the most fun in here. The one time they can really get messy.\" \"This is brilliant,\" I breathed. \"I love to paint and draw.\" Several easels were set up throughout the room and a giant cubby cabinet took up one whole wall, filled with art supplies and pictures here and there. \"You'll get your own space later, if you want to keep any work you do.\" \"That's what I wanted to do my whole life. I mean, as a career,\" I said to Al. \"I wanted to an artist. My work isn't the best, but I will say I have good ideas.\" I walked over to the window, thinking about how that was the perfect picture for inspiration. The view across Bellevue property was beautiful, even in October, with the trees and grass dying. Maybe this was a good idea. Maybe after it was over, I'd be in a good place, able to live again. Or rather want to live again. \"There's a library too in a different building, and there's always a board game or card game going on in the commons. You shouldn't ever get bored,\" he said from the doorway. \"When you get out of here, you can work on becoming a famous artist.\" My smile twisted into something more ironic. \"Doubtful. It isn't exactly a real job. My father would prefer if I were a nurse or something.\" Al snorted and folded his arms. \"Take it from me, because I am a nurse and know what I'm talking about, you do whatever makes you happy. You think because I get steady pay with benefits that it means something special? It wouldn't if I didn't enjoy it, if I didn't care about every person in this hospital.\" His words were kind, but not easily accepted. Not wanting to be rude, though, I replied, \"Perhaps, you're right, Alfred.\" After flicking out the lights, he motioned for me to exit. As we walked silently back towards my room, I thought about the odd man Al took care of: Willard. Such an old-fashioned name. Almost comedic. But I couldn't see anything funny about Willard. \"What's Willard in here for, as you put it?\" I asked. Alfred looked apprehensive for a moment before answering, \"He's a special case. Never talks to anyone, except himself. We can't get him to mingle with other patients; he won't open up to any of the doctors. I only just recently managed to persuade him to eat and take care of himself somewhat. No one's sure what to do, and honestly, I don't think they really give a damn.\" He shook his head, wearing a look of disgust. \"Why did the guard follow you both in? Is he dangerous?\" \"Well, in the time he's been here, he's never hurt anyone. Never even tried. So, as far as I'm concerned, it's all just too much precaution.\" \"Oh,\" was all I could think to say, and we continued the short trek down the hall in silence. Someone must know something more about this Willard to warrant extra safety measures. Even though I trusted Al, I felt that whoever it was, was right. \"This is my stop,\" I said when we reached my room. My companion looked in briefly at the bare walls and relatively bare furniture. \"Well, you haven't made it yours yet, but you'll grow into it.\" Putting his hand on my shoulder, he spoke more seriously, \"If you ever need help adjusting, know I'm at your service. It will be tough the first week or so, but give it time. These doctors know what they're doing.\" \"Thanks,\" I told him, looking straight into his soft green eyes. I was genuinely grateful for his adopting me to his care. This place was scarier than I cared to admit to him. \"Be seeing you,\" he tapped his forehead before taking off. \"You better soon,\" I mimicked Roxie's words to him. He snickered softly before picking the tune he had been whistling earlier back up. Ten o'clock was lights out, but it was hard to get any sleep with someone peeking into your room what seemed every 15 minutes. Wrapping the covers tighter around my body, I turned away from the door. The light coming through the window was filtered through the thick bars. Tears started to well up in my eyes. What the hell was I doing here? Why didn't I just go home? It was a long time before sleep found me. ","Summary":" A/N: Well this my first Willard fic. Also the first fic where the plot bunnies are running wild.

First Willard fanfic, and I'll admit I haven't seen the original. I've been doing my damnedest to get my hands on a copy of THAT since before I even knew they were making a sequel, but unless you're the type of person who can shell out around $40 a pop for that stuff, you're more than a little screwed there. Still, I loved the remake very much. I own nothing. This is plotless, just a little vignette, a scene that never happened. Just testing the waters, after this I just might do a continuation story that picks up at the end of the remake. I hope more Willard fics start coming out here, I only saw three. One was okay but the other two... no. I consider myself fairly open minded, but no. Just... no. Oh, by the way, if anyone on this forum actually remembers me as the creator of Edward Sporkfingers, you should know that's been started up again and moved to the Edward Scissorhands forum. And if you're expecting this fic to be like Sporkfingers, you'll be very much surprised. -------------------------------------------------------------------- It wasn't a very clean job. The skeleton which now only vaguely resembled a cat was littered with pieces of skin and fur, red bits of flesh sticking persistently to the bone. One dim, yellow eye remained in it's socket, and it stared up accusingly at the man in front of it. A warm, red puddle spread out underneath, and tiny three-toed footprints extended out in every direction. Surprisingly, most of it's tail had remained unharmed, possibly because there was very little meat on it. Intact but smeared with ruby patches of blood, it stuck out sideways in a striking fashion, the rest was a sadistic mass of gore. The man standing over this abomination saw it only for a moment, then staggered backwards, his already-pale face turning the color of lard. He hit the wall and allowed himself to slide down, eyes averted. His mouth trembled and twitched, and for a moment it looked as if he might be physically ill. But he just closed his eyes and grasped the bridge of his nose, warm tears sliding down the sides of his face. He allowed his perverse eyes to turn towards the carcass only to shrink back again seconds later. The tears stopped quickly, and he shivered against the cold basement wall, head turned to the concrete. From out of the pocket of his coat, a tiny pink nose probed the basement air, twitching nervously. A white head appeared, followed by a round, furry body, which trailed behind it a pink, wormlike tail. The white rat climbed up Willard's curled arm, it's soft claws gripping the suit's dark, coarse fabric. It sniffed the salt tears on his cheeks and nudged him with it's nose. Still unsteady, Willard reached up and grabbed the rat off his shoulder, holding it protectively against his cheek in what seemed like an embrace, with concessions made for size. \"Socrates...\" he whispered \"What did they do?\" Socrates only responded by nipping the end of his ear affectionately. Willard closed his eyes again and grit his teeth as an unpleasant thought came to him. Gently, his placed Socrates on the floor next to the prone carcass and watched, allowing his field of vision to cover as little of the cat as possible. The rat sniffed the air around the bones, paused, then simply turned and looked questioningly at Willard. It did not further desecrate the corpse, and seemed absent of the bloodlust shown by it's fellows. Relieved, Willard snatched his companion off the stone floor and held him in his hands. \"I hate all of them, all of them except you Socrates.\" he whispered, as he had many times before. A drop of blood that had gathered on Socrates's whisker grew fat and fell to the ground. ","Summary":" Okay then, hello all. First Willard fanfic, and I'll admit I haven't seen the original.

El estacionamiento estaba vacío en su totalidad, al igual que sus instalaciones. Excepto por un reducido grupo de diez estudiantes que estaban sentados en sus pupitres dentro un aula. Estaban acompañados por cuatro profesores. Uno de ellos, un apuesto hombre caucásico que vestía con un elegante traje de color negro, leía una lista de instrucciones escrita en una hoja de papel. —Las puertas permanecerán cerradas las veinticuatro horas del día —decía—. Los alumnos tendrán libre acceso a la cafetería, los dormitorios, la biblioteca y sus respectivas aulas de clase; el Grupo de Excelencia permanecerá en el Curso Intensivo durante dos semanas. —Ahora procederemos a separarlos en dos grupos —dijo una joven profesora de piel blanca y largo cabello negro—. El primer grupo estará bajo mi supervisión y la del profesor YounTae Long. El segundo grupo estará bajo la supervisión de los profesores TseTung So y JingTan Li —dicho esto tomó la hoja de papel que sostenía el primer sujeto y comenzó a llamar a sus estudiantes—. EunYong Ming, MinYoon Tsung, TenLung Soon, LiHyung Yoo y TaeLi Yang, ustedes cinco vendrán con nosotros. Los cinco aludidos se levantaron de sus asientos y siguieron a los dos profesores. Esos cinco elegidos iban todos vestidos con un elegante uniforme escolar de color negro. El grupo era bastante pintoresco: EunYong Ming era un atractivo jovencito de alta estatura. Tenía músculos que apenas se notaban. Su cabello era corto y de color negro, tenía piel blanca y unos brillantes ojos de color café. Llevaba un par de libros bajo el brazo. MinYoon Tsung era una jovencita morena. Su largo y ondulado cabello lo llevaba peinado con una apretada coleta y un flequillo cubría su frente. Usaba gafas de gruesa montura negra y abrazaba un par de libros contra su pecho. TenLung Soon era un chico con un aire torpe y desaliñado. Era moreno y de alta estatura, llevaba un par de libros bajo el brazo y mordisqueaba un bolígrafo. LiHyung Yoo era una chica que se distinguía del resto porque su uniforme se veía viejo y desgastado, como si fuera de segunda mano. Su largo cabello negro lo llevaba peinado en una coleta y dos mechones caían sobre su rostro. Llevaba bajo el brazo un bolso descolorido, de cuál sobresalían un par de libretas. Por último, TaeLi Yang era una chica pelirroja. Su piel era tan blanca como la nieve, parecía brillar en contraste con su elegante uniforme. Su cabello era tan largo que llegaba hasta su cintura, era lacio y caía como cascada. Lo llevaba peinado de tal forma que su largo flequillo cubriera gran parte de su rostro, sólo podía verse su ojo derecho, de color negro, y la mitad de sus labios. Llevaba a cuestas una mochila de color negro. Los otros cuatro iban alejados de TaeLi, como si quisieran evitar estar cerca de ella. Siguieron a los dos profesores, YoungTae Long y la profesora que llevaba por nombre KimIn Choi, hasta otra aula de clases. Ahí ocuparon cada uno un pupitre cada uno, TaeLi fue a sentarse hasta el fondo del salón, mientras que sus compañeros ocuparon los asientos del frente. El profesor Long comenzó a escribir algunas palabras mientras la profesora Choi hablaba para sus estudiantes: —Ustedes cinco son los mejores del Grupo de Excelencia. Por lo tanto, tomarán un curso más avanzado que el resto. El profesor Long escribirá en la pizarra los temas que abordaremos durante el Curso Intensivo. Más vale que mantengan sus buenas notas o serán expulsados del instituto. Aquél grupo de alumnos, el Grupo de Excelencia, estaba conformado por aquellos estudiantes que tuvieran las más altas notas. Luego de cada temporada de exámenes, el resto del cuerpo estudiantil tenía dos semanas de vacaciones, mientras el Grupo de Excelencia debía permanecer dentro del instituto para tomar un curso de clases avanzadas, el cual debían aprobar con la mejor nota para no ser expulsados. Esas eran las reglas del instituto, que llevaba por nombre ChangIn High. Algo interrumpió en ese momento las palabras de la profesora Choi. Una melodía resonó por los altavoces, era una tonada de música clásica que indicaba los cambios de clase. El grupo habría actuado con naturalidad de no haber sido por una voz mecánicamente distorsionada que siguió a aquella melodía. La voz dijo lo siguiente: —Quiero dar la bienvenida al Grupo de Excelencia. Sé que deben estar cansados de estudiar, pero me temo que tendrán que presentar un último examen. Están ahora separados en dos grupos y eso lo hará más interesante —en ese momento, el televisor que se encontraba dentro del aula se encendió, mostrando en pantalla un número telefónico—. Les haré una sencilla pregunta y ustedes deberán enviar la respuesta en un mensaje de texto al número que acaba de aparecer en la pantalla del televisor. Será como un juego divertido, las reglas son sencillas: si contestan de forma equivocada iré matando a cada uno de ustedes. Pero si sus respuestas son acertadas, entonces permanecerán con vida. El juego terminará si llegan con vida al día de mañana a esta hora. Podrán terminarlo también si descubren quién soy y en qué parte del instituto me encuentro. Y la primera pregunta es la siguiente: ¿cuántos miembros del PTA se encuentran dentro de ChangIn High en este momento?... Tienen cinco minutos para responder. La voz se quedó en silencio y en la pantalla del televisor apareció un reloj que marcaba cinco minutos en cuenta regresiva. La profesora Choi miró aterrada a su compañero, que estaba estupefacto. Sus estudiantes entraron en pánico. — ¡Yo soy miembro del PTA! —dijo MinYoon apresuradamente. — ¿Qué es el PTA? —preguntó LiHyung confundida. —Es el grupo de estudiantes cuyos padres apoyan económicamente a ChangIn High —explicó TenLung—. Yo también soy parte de ellos. —Y yo —dijo EunYong y miró a LiHyung para preguntar—: ¿Eres del PTA? — ¡Claro que no! —Respondió la aludida—. Yo sólo puedo estudiar en ChangIn High porque tengo las notas más altas. —Entonces somos tres miembros del PTA —dijo TenLung y miró a TaeLi para preguntarle en voz alta—: ¡Hey, Yang! ¿Eres parte del PTA? TaeLi se limitó a negar con la cabeza, se mostraba demasiado tranquila. TenLung la fulminó con la mirada. —Hay tres miembros del PTA en este grupo, pero, ¿cuántos habrá entre nuestros otros compañeros? —preguntó LiHyung. — ¡Profesora Choi! —Llamó MinYoon mirando a la aludida—. ¿Usted y el profesor Long saben la respuesta? — ¡Claro que no! —Soltó la profesora Choi con severidad—. ¡Y ustedes, quédense en su lugar! ¡El profesor Long y yo iremos a buscar al responsable! — ¡Pero si no enviamos la respuesta, uno de nosotros morirá! —exclamó LiHyung aterrada. — ¡Esto no es más que una broma de mal gusto! —soltó el profesor Long enfurecido—. ¡Ahora quédense aquí en silencio! Dicho aquello, ambos profesores salieron del aula, abandonando al grupo. Quedaban dos minutos del plazo establecido. — ¿Alguno de ustedes tiene un teléfono celular? —preguntó EunYong en un susurro. —Yo tengo el mío —informó LiHyung sacando el aparato de su bolsillo. —Pero aún no tenemos la respuesta —les recordó MinYoon. —Podríamos ser los únicos miembros del PTA —dijo EunYong—. Deberíamos arriesgarnos. Sin embargo, el plazo de cinco minutos se terminó y la voz volvió a escucharse por los altavoces: —La respuesta es... incorrecta. En la pantalla del televisor, los cinco estudiantes pudieron ver a sus otros compañeros, sólo unos segundos antes de que ocurriera una pequeña explosión y todos se vieran acribillados por un centenar de afilados cuchillos. Todos murieron. LiHyung gritó aterrorizada y se cubrió los ojos para no tener que ver aquello. La voz no volvió a escucharse, pero cuatro de los cinco estudiantes de aquél salón estaban aterrados. La quinta, TaeLi, se levantó de su asiento y sacó de su mochila negra un objeto afilado: un cuchillo para pan. Acto seguido, avanzó hasta la puerta del aula y la atrancó, arrastrando una estantería para bloquear la entrada. Miró a sus compañeros y esbozó una maligna sonrisa.[Chapter 2] No había rastro de los dos profesores que estaban a cargo del grupo. TaeLi se encontraba sentada en una orilla del escritorio y jugueteaba con el filo de su enorme cuchillo. LiHyung se había hundido en su asiento y se restregaba las manos de tal forma que parecía querer arrancarse la piel. — ¡Oye! —llamó MinYoon desde su asiento y TaeLi le dedicó una mirada despectiva—. ¿De qué se trata, Yang? —Las reglas fueron bastante claras, ¿no crees? —Respondió TaeLi con un amenazador siseo—. La única forma de sobrevivir es respondiendo a las preguntas que nos hagan. ¿O quieres salir y buscar tú misma a esa persona? —inquirió esbozando una sonrisa burlona. — ¿Y para qué ese cuchillo? —Respondió MinYoon levantándose desde su silla con violencia—. ¿Tú estás con esa persona? —acusó con voz aguda. —Debí suponer que yo sería la primera sospechosa cuando empezáramos a buscar culpables —comentó TaeLi despreocupadamente—. Intentas asesinar a tu compañera de habitación y todo el mundo pierde la cabeza… Sus cuatro compañeros se quedaron congelados al escuchar aquello. Con todo, MinYoon avanzó hasta TaeLi y le propinó una fuerte bofetada para hacerla callar. Los dos muchachos intercambiaron miradas de angustia y LiHyung se hundió aún más en su asiento. El golpe resonó en las cuatro paredes del aula donde se encontraban y dejó una marca roja en la mejilla de TaeLi. Mirando con auténtico odio a MinYoon, la pelirroja se lanzó sobre su compañera para dominarla y logró empujarla hasta que estrelló su espalda contra la pizarra. Se levantó una pequeña nube de polvo de tiza y MinYoon ahogó un grito cuando su compañera le puso el cuchillo al cuello. — ¡Estás loca! —soltó la audaz boca de MinYoon con voz ahogada. La siniestra sonrisa de la pelirroja se acrecentó. —No tienes idea de lo que es estar loca. Dicho aquello, usó su cuchillo para hacer un limpio corte que seccionó el cuello de MinYoon de lado a lado. El cuerpo inerte de la chica cayó al suelo y comenzó a crecer el charco de sangre que emanaba de la herida. LiHyung soltó un grito tan potente que sintió cómo se rasgaban sus cuerdas vocales. Los dos muchachos respiraban agitadamente, estaban completamente aterrados. — ¿Alguien más se quiere hacer el valiente? —preguntó TaeLi avanzando hacia sus tres compañeros restantes con el cuchillo en alto. Una gota de sangre cayó de la punta del cuchillo, un brillo psicópata se reflejaba en los ojos de la pelirroja. Soltando un sollozo, LiHyung se levantó de su asiento y le dio un fuerte empujón a TaeLi para derribarla. La pelirroja cayó y el cuchillo resbaló de su mano. LiHyung logró mover la estantería que le bloqueaba la entrada y escapó enfilándose por el largo pasillo a trompicones. — ¡LiHyung Yoo! —llamó EunYong y salió corriendo detrás de ella. TenLung siguió a su amigo dejando sola a la pelirroja. LiHyung corrió a toda velocidad hasta llegar a la entrada de aquél edificio. Sintió que su mundo se desmoronaba cuando vio las cadenas que mantenían cerrada la puerta. Intentó retirarlas, tirando con fuerza de ellas, sin tener éxito en su escape. Golpeó la puerta varias veces sin lograr quebrar los cristales. Gritaba y sollozaba sin parar, deseando que los profesores o cualquier otra persona pudieran escucharla. Escuchó las voces de sus dos compañeros que la llamaban a gritos. Se giró y los vio correr hacia ella. Se sintió aliviada de que TaeLi no los acompañara aunque a la vez hubiera dado cualquier cosa con tal de saber que uno de ellos había muerto en el camino. Mientras no fuera así, cualquiera era un blanco fácil. — ¡LiHyung! —exclamó EunYong enfurecido al llegar con ella—. ¡No vuelvas a salir así, no sabes lo peligroso que es! La tomó por los hombros y le dio una fuerte sacudida, aquello bastó para devolverle un poco de tranquilidad a la chica. — ¡Tenemos que salir de aquí! —intervino TenLung antes de que la aterrada chica se lanzara a los brazos del muchacho para llorar desconsoladamente. —La puerta está cerrada —le indicó la chica señalando las cadenas con una sacudida de la cabeza—. ¿Cómo vamos a salir? —Por una ventana —puntualizó EunYong dando un chasquido—. Pueden bloquear las puertas pero es imposible que protegieran todos los cristales de los edificios. —Tiene sentido —dijo TenLung pensativo—. Pero no deberíamos ir todos. Podría ser arriesgado… —Así como sería arriesgado que saliera uno solamente —intervino LiHyung—. ¿No hay manera de saber si hay peligro afuera? EunYong separó los labios para responder cuando volvió a sonar aquella tonada que indicaba el cambio de clase. Aunque en aquél momento, aquella música anunciaba que era momento de otra pregunta. LiHyung retrocedió asustada cuando aquella voz salió por los altavoces. —Es hora de su siguiente pregunta —decía la voz—. Pero antes, quiero que saluden a mi invitada. Un terrible grito escapó de los altavoces. La profesora Choi estaba con aquél sujeto. —Hay tres aulas de cómputo en el edificio donde se encuentran. Cada una contiene veinte ordenadores. Sesenta ordenadores de los cuales solamente dos funcionarán durante los próximos diez minutos. Ustedes tendrán que encontrar esos ordenadores e introducir la respuesta en el campo de texto que encontrarán en la pantalla. De lo contrario, asesinaré a mi invitada. Otro grito, EunYong ahogó el epíteto que amenazaba con brotar de su garganta. —La pregunta es la siguiente: Si quedan cuatro estudiantes con vida, y a cada hora mataré a uno de ustedes, ¿cuánto tiempo tardaré en eliminarlos a todos? La voz se apagó. —Es sencillo, cuatro horas —comentó EunYong—. Vamos a buscar ese ordenador para enviar la respuesta. Echaron a correr tan rápido como sus piernas les permitían. TenLung tropezó en un par de ocasiones y su amigo tuvo que tomarlo por el cuello de la camisa para levantarlo. La primera aula de cómputo tenía todos los ordenadores apagados y cada una de las pantallas había una hoja de papel pegada con cinta que rezaba escrita con sangre la palabra MUERTE . Quedaban cinco minutos cuando emprendieron la carrera hacia la siguiente aula, que quedaba tres pisos más arriba, en la cual tampoco tuvieron éxito. LiHyung comenzaba a sucumbir a la desesperación y no podía dejar de sollozar. Tuvieron que subir dos pisos más para llegar a su última opción. La voz había dicho la verdad, dos ordenadores estaban encendidos. EunYong corrió hacia uno de ellos, quedaba un minuto. — ¡Date prisa! —urgió TenLung. La voz volvió a escucharse una vez que EunYong pulsó la tecla para enviar la respuesta. —La respuesta es… Incorrecta. La profesora Choi volvió a gritar antes de que los tres muchachos vieran caer su cuerpo por las ventanas del aula. El cuerpo de la profesora Choi yacía en el suelo, fuera del edificio, en medio de un charco de sangre. LiHyung retrocedió aterrada, tapando sus ojos con las manos y sollozando sin parar. EunYong se había quedado sin palabras. TenLung, por el contrario, corrió uno de los cristales de la ventana con la intención de tener una mejor visión del cadáver de la profesora Choi. Lo inimaginable ocurrió entonces. Se escuchó el sonido de un disparo y TenLung cayó de espaldas dentro del aula con una bala introducida en su cráneo.[Chapter 3] Tras ver morir a TenLung, LiHyung fue víctima de un ataque de nervios que derivó en un intento de suicidio. Intentó cortar sus muñecas con una pequeña navaja encontrada en el archivero del aula de cómputo. EunYong consiguió detenerla a tiempo y por esa razón se encontraban ambos agazapados en un rincón del aula. Cubrieron a TenLung con el saco del uniforme de EunYong aunque el charco de sangre crecía bajo su cabeza e ira imposible no verlo. No querían salir pues temían que el homicida, fuera quien fuese, los obligara a responder otra pregunta si abandonaban el aula. Y tras pasar tres horas en aquél lugar, supieron que su plan marchaba a la perfección. EunYong abrazaba a LiHyung quien tenía un corte en su muñeca izquierda aunque no tan profundo como para desangrarse. Ella había dejado de llorar hacía pocos minutos y el muchacho no dejaba de acariciar su espalda. Fue entonces que su estómago reclamó por un poco de alimento y se vio obligado a levantarse. — ¿A dónde vas? —reclamó LiHyung con voz quebradiza cuando lo vio estirar los brazos para desentumecerse. —Tengo hambre —respondió él—. En el pasillo hay una máquina expendedora, iré por un bocadillo. — ¡No puedes salir! —Exclamó ella aterrada—. ¡Si te vas, nos pondrán a prueba de nuevo! —Necesitamos estar juntos para que nos pongan a prueba —dijo él con indiferencia. — ¡Idiota! ¡Si me dejas aquí, yo podría ser la siguiente! EunYong la fulminó con la mirada por aquél comentario tan egoísta pero igualmente asintió. Ella tenía razón, debían permanecer juntos para no darle al homicida la oportunidad de secuestrar a uno de ellos para la siguiente prueba. —Ven conmigo —dijo y le tendió una mano—. Vamos por algo de comida y luego volvemos aquí, ¿te parece bien? LiHyung estuvo de acuerdo. Sin embargo, se llevaron una terrible sorpresa cuando salieron al pasillo y vieron la figura que había al fondo. Era una chica pelirroja de cabello largo y que llevaba un cuchillo para pan en la mano derecha. El cuchillo estaba bañado en sangre. EunYong y LiHyung retrocedieron aterrados pero en ese momento se escuchó la tonada de música que anunciaba que era momento de la siguiente pregunta. —G, T, A, L, I, N, Y, A, E —decía la voz distorsionada, LiHyung se abrazó a sí misma con fuerza—. En el sótano del edificio donde se encuentran habrá un panel para introducir la respuesta. Tienen diez minutos o mataré a dos de ustedes. Al mismo tiempo que la voz dejó de hablar, TaeLi se abalanzó sobre ellos con el cuchillo en alto. LiHyung soltó un grito agudo cuando sintió el filo cortar sobre su brazo izquierdo. Con un empujón, EunYong consiguió sacar a la pelirroja del camino para tomar a LiHyung del brazo que no estaba herido y echar a correr hacia el bloque de escaleras. El muchacho era mucho más veloz así que LiHyung tenía que arrastrar los pies. TaeLi no se hizo esperar pues pronto comenzó a pisarle los talones. Mientras corrían e intentaban esquivar el filo del cuchillo, EunYong comenzó a pensar en una respuesta. Quedaban cinco minutos. — ¡Es un anagrama! —Dijo mientras seguían en el bloque de escaleras—. ¡Rápido, piensa en alguna palabra! — ¡No lo sé! —Reclamó LiHyung—. ¡No puedo…! Pero la respuesta llegó a ella de golpe. G. T. A. L. I. N. Y. A. E. TaeLi Yang. — ¡Es ella! —exclamó—. ¡Es TaeLi Yang! ¡El anagrama es su nombre! Para el muchacho tenía todo el sentido del mundo así que se limitó a asentir. Entraron al sótano tras darle una patada a la puerta. Retrocedieron aterrados al ver a la figura que dentro los esperaba. Ahí se encontraba el profesor Long. Tenía una soga al cuello y se debatía por evitar que sus pies cayeran de la delgada tabla de madera que lo salvaba de morir estrangulado. Detrás de él, la pared estaba tapizada con fotografías de los alumnos que formaban el Grupo de Excelencia. Cada uno de ellos tenía el rostro tachado con sangre que aún se conservaba fresca. Todos, excepto dos. Quedaban dos minutos. EunYong prefirió hacer caso omiso a lo que veía y se acercó al panel. Un computador al cual debían introducir la respuesta. Entró el nombre de TaeLi cuando aún quedaba un minuto. Fue en ese momento que la voz distorsionada volvió. —La respuesta es… Incorrecta. EunYong intentó reclamar en voz alta cuando el cuchillo se hundió en nuca hasta que la punta consiguió salir por su garganta. Cayó inerte al suelo al mismo tiempo que la tabla de madera se partía por la mitad y el cuerpo del profesor Long moría estrangulado a causa de su propio peso.[Chapter 4] Solté el mango del cuchillo para que EunYong pudiera caer al suelo. La sangre se encharcaba bajo mis pies cuando me agaché para tomar de vuelta el mango. TaeLi tenía la mejilla derecha cubierta con la sangre de EunYong cuando me acerqué a ella. Gritó con voz tan aguda que por un momento me pareció que me reventaría los tímpanos. La tomé por el cuello y la estrellé con fuerza con el muro de fotografías. — ¡Te odio! —exclamé asegurándome de alzar la voz lo suficiente para grabarla bien en su memoria. Volví a estrellarla contra el muro de fotografías y vi la sangre que salía de su cabeza. — ¡Maldita seas tú y todos los miembros del estúpido PTA! —seguí diciendo—. ¡Como si dar un par de billetes a favor de ChangIn High los hiciera mejores personas! Estaba tan furiosa en contra del PTA, en contra de esa escuela tan elitista. ¿Acaso creían que podían seguir seleccionando sólo miembros del PTA para el Grupo de Excelencia? Deseaba echarle las manos al cuello a todos los directivos. Deseaba poder quemar esa escuela del demonio. De repente ya estaba apuñalando a TaeLi contra la pared de las fotografías y ella no dejaba de gritar. Únicamente guardó silencio cuando usé el cuchillo para cortar de lado a lado su garganta y ella resbaló hasta llegar al suelo. Arranqué entonces su fotografía, una de las dos que no estaba tachada con sangre. La otra le pertenecía a EunYong. Rompí en dos la fotografía de TaeLi y luego clavé el cuchillo para pan encima de la fotografía de EunYong. Entré entonces mi nombre en la computadora y con eso conseguí abrir las puertas de ChangIn High. Salí y caminé bañada en sangre hasta llegar a la ciudad. — Fue así como pasó… —dijo LiHyung con voz quebradiza y enjugó sus lágrimas con el dorso de la mano—. TaeLi asesinó a EunYong y yo… Yo… —Abriremos las investigaciones —aseguró el detective que la interrogaba—. Mientras tanto, usted tendrá que quedarse aquí para… LiHyung se enfureció entonces y sacó de debajo de sus ropas su cuchillo para cortar en dos la garganta del detective. Acto seguido, lo apuñaló en el rostro repetidas veces hasta que consiguió sacar varios tajos de carne. Con las manos bañadas en sangre, saltó por la ventana y echó a correr para escapar. ChangIn High. Su venganza aún no terminaba.

Willard remembered his life before all this. A tear formed in hisrneye and fell down his pale face. Without thinking Sandy walked over to Willard and moved her hand tornhis face. \"Ah, I..I\" he stuttered. Willard felt warmth. Just thenrnit ended. \"Don't touch him!\" a strong voice said. The man ran in and lookedrnat Sandy, \"No funny business little lady, this here is a bad man.\" Jimrncame in and hurried her out. \"As for you rat boy I'm watching you.\" asrnhe said that he walked out and shut the door. Sandy felt tears form inrnher eyes she couldn't hold them in. \"Shhh, it's ok pumpkin,\" Jim's soothingrnvoice said. When they were in Jim's car Sandy blurted out therntears coming back \"Why did they do that! Willard didn't do anything!\" Shernwas full of rage now. \"He was sad dad! Why is he in that stupid place?\" \"Honey they told me he was trying to grab you.\" Jim replied. \"He wasn't.\"rnSandy whispered. The rest of the ride was silent. When they got back homernSandy went up to her dad and hugged him. \"I'm sorry,\" she said under herrnbreath. \"Mr.Stiles was going to say something, I don't know what it was.rnHe was cut off by that idiot man.\" Sandy spoke these words as she drewrnaway from her father. Her father had lost his happy face. \"Don't worryrnSandy, they won't hurt him anymore,\" Jim said gently. Sandy buried her face in the feather filled pillow.rnShe had to do something... Sandy got up and walked downstairs. She wentrnup to her dad who was watching some cooking show. \"Hey dad, um I was wonderingrnif I could take a look at Mr.Stiles' file?\" Sandy asked in her gentlestrnvoice. \"Um...I guess so pumpkin,\" Jim replied. \"I'll pick it up tomorrow.\" When Sandy got back from school she waited for herrndad. Then the door unlocked and her dad walked in letting a cold gust ofrnwind flow in. It sent a chill up Sandy's back. \"Sandy I'm home!\" Jim cooed. \"Hi dad!\" she replied. \"I got Willard'srnfile for you,\" Jim said. He handed Sandy a piece of paper. She looked atrnit then went up to her room. This is what the file said - Name: Willard Stiles Patient Number: 9-11 Date Of Birth: March, 23, 1976 Hair Colour: Black Eye Colour: Blue Problem: Possibly insane History: Grew up in a small neighborhood. Lived with sickly motherrnwho passed away. House was infested with rats. Notes: Hasn't talked since he came. Does not eat a lot. Does not appearrnto be hostile. Probably has a gentle nature. Seemed to talk to himselfrnthe night he was found in his house before he was caught. Sandy thought to herself House infested with rats...[Chapter 2] Chapter two. I hope you guys like it. Back at Willard's cell he sleeps. He felt warm fur against his hand.rnA small nose nudging him. \"Socrates?\" he whispered. Willard awakens. Itrnwas just a dream... Is life worth it all? Willard sees a sharprnpiece of metal on the tiny bed. He edges closer. Willard places the palmrnof his hand over the rusty metal. He pulls his hand back quickly. Red blood drips from the pale palm. Just then the door opens. Caught. \"Hello Willard, ... Oh my god! What have you done!\" Jim shouts after eyeingrnthe blood stained sheets. \"Why Willard? Why?\" Jim asks as he steps toward Willard. Jim triesrnto look at Willard's hand but to no use as the thin man jerks back. Jimrnruns out and calls some one to help. A women steps in with a first aid kit. Her hair, greying with age isrntied back in a bun. She grabs Willard's hand. \"If you don't listen to me,rnthe consenquences will be... painful,\" she threateneds. Willard gives up. The women takes out a towel andrnwipes his palm then she pours some achohol on his hand. Screams of painrnescape his dry throught. Sandy felt the thoughts trickle in. Se was drawnrnto Willard because of curiosity. His pale appreance and silent ways pokedrnat Sandy to find was was underneath the sorowful exterior. She felt sorryrnfor him, trying to think of ways to help. \" Poor guy, I hope that therernis some way that I can help him,\" she thought. Willard thought of Cathryn, that girl reminded himrnof the women he used to know. She was one of the few who cared. His mother,rnwell you could say she did in her own special way. Socrates cared.

Note: Innthe \"Actual Summary\" I think that putting the part about Ria willnsorta ruin it… so yeah… Big… Obsessive… Crispin Glover fan…nso… I dunno… I'm hoping it doesn't go all Mary Sue… Cuz ofnthe original Character… But the story line eludes to this one partnin Sin City, And thatna was a pretty big part…heh… on with amature fanfiction…. The place reeked to some of bitter almonds, or oldnpeople, or dirty laundry, or even all of it mixed together, but itnwas always sprinkled with a bit of the scent of human and animalndecay. To little Ria, the smell smelt ofnbitter almonds and dirty laundry and of course a bit of decay. But itnwas faint to her, so she didn't really scrunch her face up when shenwalked through the doors of the tauntingly white asylum. Or when shenwalked behind the bulk in white scrub uniforms that lead her throughnthe messy rec room. Amazing really, because all the furniture wasnpermanently scented with bile. She looked out the barred window andnsaw daybreak, blues blending into dark blue. She liked to imitate itnin her coloring book. Not caring for the bold lines that werenpre-made to color in. Sketch books were \"Too expensive\" fornsomeone who worked full time at an asylum… As an old woman walked pass little Ria she bentndown and kissed her forehead and said in a cracking voice \"Goodnnight Kristin, my darling daughter!\" She turned away and coughednviolently bringing up blood and attracting the man in white scrub'snattention. \"Bobby Joe, you need to get to yournroom!\" Ria's father barked. He grabbed the elderly woman's armnroughly and dragged her down the hallway. Screaming and twisting,nBobby Joe screamed as a sickening crack issued and an arm dangled atnher side in a most gruesome way. \"Oi! Bobby Joe broke her armnagain! Oi? OI! SOME ONE GET THE HELL OVER HERE!\" the man's voicenechoed down the gray hallways as ditzy nurses streamed in. Rianshrugged and walked down the opposite hallway. She walked down this corridor becausenit held her seven-year-old attention span with a vice like grip. Itnheld people who could only go out on good behavior, the homicidalnwackos, those who were driven over the edge. Ria sat between cell door 756, whichnheld a teenager girl with three distinct personalities, and 758, anthirty-year-old man quiet and lashed out with any object. Across wasncell and empty cell, 757, it was to be filled yesterday but somethingnprolonged it. It was unlocked and the door was ajar to spark theninterest of little Ria. Walking in she made herselfncomfortable in a cozy corner. She took out crayons and coloring booksnand began to color the dawn sky over a happy caterpillar. Her father didn't really paynattention to her. He assumed that after a fifteen minute talk beforenevery trip to his work about \"the crazies that will come out andngut you and eat you before daddy can come and save you.\" And to addna little kick, \"just like mommy,\" always ensured the fear.[Chapter 2] His breath was harsh and slow; they dragged him innbecause of his exhausted state. They had beaten him into a mostnuncomfortable straight jacket. Black hair feel down around his facenhiding hatred filled tired eyes. His thin lips trembled when he wasnin this state. A bulky man in white scrubs sighednand rubbed the sleep from his eyes and squinted at him. \"Right…nName?\" the man on his right muttered a \"Stiles\" \"Eh… yeah…. Kay… room 757,nunlocked, oh and Trent?\" Half way through the door Willard'snguard looked back at the man. \"Yeah Mains?\" \"Can you feed little Ria? She mightnhave forgotten to bring her food again.\" Mains sighed and gave anstrained smile while the other man nodded and gave a quick twitch ofnhis lips. He walks off with Willard in tow and the other guard downnthe hall. \"Little Mischief needs to be fedneh?\" \"Gods, I dunno why he brings hernhere… she's old enough to take care of herself…\" He didn'tnquite care for their gossip or small talk. The only interesting thingnwas the fact some girl was running around a house of crazy people butnhe had more pressing things to flood his mind. Little Ria's POV \"Aww…\" she lookednup again at the gloomy windows as the colors of dawn sky's began tongo to it's regular gray. She didn't want to fill her book withnGrey and yellow mixing. She took out a book instead and a small chunknof food. It wasn't for her, it was to attract friends. She startednreading some little kids book… ABC's, Ladynwith the Alligator purse, and ToothnFairy , were her favorites that she broughtnalong. Willard's POV Down a hallway, the bile scentednfurniture could still be hinted as well as bitter almonds, and dirtynlaundry. But the scent that almost brought him to tears was the smellnof animal decay. It reminded of the ashes and Socratic, but he foughtnthem down. \"… So where ever that gremlin isnhiding she's not gonna be happy… Right Mr. Stiles, this is yournroom…\" He turned Willard aroundnto unbuckle his Straight Jacket; itchy wool coat and a thin cottonnshirt were reveled. He shivered against the coldness hitting hisnskin. He spotted a heater. Warmth! He turned around and received a rough shove and he stumbled into hisnroom. Little Ria's POV Footsteps, to menntalking, familiar voices, they were at the door. She peaked fromnbehind a dresser. Trent? Aww… Henhated her, and she hated him, his cold gaze made her coil into a ballnor run, which made him only angrier. She shrunk back into the corner. \"Right Mr. Stiles, this is yournroom.\" She contemplated running but her young ignorance, and fearnof Trent, made her rather the unknown prisoner. A slight grunt and thud told her thatnshe was locked in the room with the inmate. Deciding for the best,nRia stayed in the corner. It was dead silent in the cold room, so shencould slightly hear the man's teeth chatter. Something about thenbones clicking together made her want to laugh, but she repressednherself. The bed creaked and the man sighed… for ten minutes shenwaited and decided to read her books. Five minutes into the ToothnFairy the bed gave small creeks and she couldnhear the man grunt and make odd noises, like he was repressing anfeeling. It scarred her, as well as humored her. After five minutes of this, a loudncreek, thud and scream, and running footsteps and repeated thuds madenher gasp loudly. But the repeated bangs and continual screamingndrowned it out. The screams turning into sobs and the thuds died downnto half heart thumps. She heard him slid down the door and cry andnsob. She dared a peek. The man before hernwas lanky, dark haired, and shaking. He had his head to knees, hisnhands wrapped around his legs, and his knuckles clutched to the thin,npinstriped fabric that were his pants. She shrunk back again silently. Shendidn't know whether to read a book, or comfort the crazy man. Shensat there and stared at the sky. The man sniffed and groaned andnbanged at the door half-heartedly. He received a \"What the HELL arenyou doing Stiles?\" She heard him take a sharp intake of breath. Itnsounded more like a hiss of annoyance from a snake. As the man named Stiles walked backnto his itchy cot, as the heater clicked and groaned into action. Itngot hot very quickly. Stiles again moved off the bed and to thenheater. He stumbled a bit, his hair covered his eyes, and bloodyntrickled down from his forehead to his eyes. He was wiping away thentears and blood so he didn't notice Ria sitting next to the heater.nHe sat next to it to gather all the warmth he could. His knees drawnnup and arms wrapped around his legs. After a long moment he seemed tonbe sleeping. She took up her books again, waitingnfor somebody, or maybe she would chance Trent, to open the slot andngive Stiles his meal. And hour had passed and the sky was anwhitish and gray blur that little Ria had no desire to color. Hernbooks had been twice read and the heater was on again after anthirty-minute pause. The only thing left was her friends. To be precise, it was her micenfriends, occasionally a toned down rat, but mostly mice. She likednthe white mouse that visited her often and played with her. Theynalways found eachother if Ria put down food. Sighing, she waited andnwaited for her friend. She wanted to move around, jump, and yell. Itnwas too much of a seven-year-old girl to sit still for two hours. Squeak, squeak. Shensmiled at the sound of tiny feet scampering across the floor. Shenagain heard her friends squeaks, she chanced a look to the other sidenof the heater. The man had picked up her friend! If there were one thing she would putnher life on the line for, it would be for her few friends. \"Mine! MINE!\" She launchednherself at Stiles with all her pent up energy. The man backed upnagainst the wall and held the mouse closer to him. She skidded to thenfloor and ran at him again, attempting to free her friend. \"Givenhim back!\" she clawed at his hand. Willard's POV What the? Seven-year-old girls do not suddenly appear in a cell. He stood upnand winced as her nails dug into his leg. \"Mine! Mine! Give himnback! Don't kill him! Please\" He received a kick in the leg andnwinced. He didn't do well with kids; henonly encountered them sometimes when he rode the bus. Had she been innhere the whole time? She was quiet. He walked over to his bed andnexamined the child's 'friend.' His eyes began to waternat the size and color of the mouse. \"Socrates… \"nHe shook in his bed and the girl's voice seemed farnaway, or did she stop. He didn't know, he gave the inquisitivenmouse a shaky smile and remembered the words Kat told him aboutnreincarnation. Feeling pressure next tonhim, he looked down and saw the girl lean over him and strokenSocrates gently. His jaw tightened as she slowly looked up at himnwith wary eyes. Eyes like a wolf… Hernkin was in the hand of a stranger, why shouldn't she be suspicious. She pressed her lips together andngulped all the while stared intently at Willard. He shifted, his jawnticked, he looked from the mouse to her. The child's hand left thenmouse and her gaze grew tenser. He narrowed his eyes, her lipsnrelaxed, but her jaw twitched and she pushed back softly. Bringing her legs up to the bed andnto her chest, the girl rested one arm on top of her knobby knees. Thenfree arm's thumb was in her mouth, and unconscious jester of hernyoung troubled mind. He petted Socrates oncenmore and gave him over to the girl. Hinting a smile on her deathlynpale lips, the child carefully took her kin and began to stutter.n\"T-t-th-thank you…\" She shivered and grimaced at the crappynlittle cell. \"… What… is…. Y-y-you name?\" mightnas well have some social contact… The girlncontemplated weather or not to say as she huddled around the mousenprotectively. \"… R-Ria…\" He attempted a grin, it must havenlooked malicious because she shrunk away. He quickly wiped it sincenhis expressions came off… violent. \"Why are you here… in my cell…nRia?\" The child brightened at her name. \"Well… my father worksnhere… and I came into your cell because it was opened… and It hasnthe best window… \" She looked over at the heater where her thingsnlaid. \"I heard Trent'snvoice… he\" she whispered, embarrassed. \" henscares me… and they shut the door…\" annawkward silence filled the room for Willard. \"Why did you bang your head againstnthe wall?\" He looked down, Willard knew it was coming and lookedndown embarrassed… \"Erm… well…\" Chancing a glance up, Willard saw herneyes adverted, absently mindedly stroking Socrates. She looked up atnhim when she heard nothing. Nodding that she understood, Ria lookednback down. \" Ria? Ria?nOi!!! RIA?\" Ria sighed and got up. Reaching intonher pockets, Ria gave something to Socrates and wandered over tongather her stuff. \"Good bye Stiles… I will see younlater…\" nodding her head to Willard she made her way to the ironndoor and said, \"Yes Trent? I am here…\" Cursing could be heardnon the other side. \"What the hell Ria?\" Metalnclanking and jangling, clicks, the sound of iron grinding heavily onnconcrete. \"You! Stay back!\" Willard hadn'tnmoved a muscle, he continued to face the opposite wall, he watchednthe girl and burly man walk out from the corner of his eye. As thendoor shut, a stern scolding could be heard on the other side.

LiebenGrüße Paula[Chapter 2] Plötzlichnwar sie an einem Ort an dem sie ganz sicher nicht sein sollte. Es warnheiß und die Luft roch anders. Eben noch hatte sie an ihremnSchreibtisch in ihrem Zimmer gesessen und Musik gehört und jetzt warnsie hier! Sie schaute sich um. Sie war in so etwas wie einer Steppengelandet. Um sie herum war Sand und am Horizont konnte sie einenngrünen Streifen ausmachen. Plötzlich hörte sie ein leisesnGeräusch, dass sie herumfahren ließ. Es war das Schluchze einesnKindes. Sie suchte automatisch nach der Quelle des Lauts, es war fastnwie ein Instinkt. Zuhause hatte sie einen kleinen Bruder gehabt, dernauch oft geweint hatte und auch das hatte sie jedes Mal dazunverleitete, sofort den Grund für sein Leid zu suchen und diesennauszuschalten. Sie suchte mit den Augen die Gegend ab, auf der Suchennach dem Wesen, dass dieses herzerweichende Schluchzen von sich gebennkönnte. Neben sich sah sie einige mehr oder weniger zerstörtenPlanwagen und darunter schien das Geräusch hervorzukommen. Sie gingnin die Hocke und spähte unter den Wagen, der ihr am nächsten stand.nTatsächlich saß dort ein kleines Mädchen und weinte. Sie rief dienKleine an:\" Hey du, du brauchst keine Angst zu haben. Willst dunnicht unter dem Wagen hervorkommen? Ich heiße Paula und wie heißtndu?\" Das Kind sah sie mit großen Augen an und sagte dann leise:\"nKadlynn.\" Paula erwiderte:\" Kadlynn, das ist ein wunderschönernName. Komm doch mal unter dem Wagen hervor und erzähl mir warum dunweinst.\" Sie sah das Mädchen an nun lächelte so freundlich undnvertrauenerweckend, wie sie nur konnte. Kadlynn kletterte zögerlichnunter dem Wagen hervor. Dort nahm Paula sie in den Arm, strich ihrndie blonden Haare aus dem Gesicht und wischte ihre Tränen weg. Alsnsie sich mit Kadlynn auf dem Arm umdrehte und aufrichtete, erschraknsie. Dort stand ein Pferd. Es war aufgezäumt und gesattelt undnwartete anscheinend geduldig auf sie. Paula blieb erst mal stehen undnbetrachtete das Tier eingehend. Es war wirklich schön, graues Fell,ngrau Mähne, grauer Schweif. Es sah gepflegt und gesund aus und sahnsie mit klugen Augen an. Kadlynn schien begeistert. Sie hattenaufgehört zu weinen und lehnte sich zu dem Tier hin um es zunstreicheln. Diese kam einige Schritte näher und legte seinen Kopf anndie Wange der Kleinen. Sie kicherte, als das Pony des Pferdes sie imnGesichte kitzelte und fragte:\" Ist das deins? Darf ich auch mal dandrauf reiten?\" Paula erwiderte verdattert:\" Also ich denke dasnist meines und wenn das so ist, darfst du natürlich mal daraufnreiten.\" Kadlynn lächelte und sagte: \"Also wo gehen wir jetztnhin?\" Paula antwortete immer noch leicht verwirt:\" Tja, dasnwüsste ich auch gern. Und wo kommst du eigentlich her und wo sindndeine Eltern?\" Sie hatte anscheinend einen Nerv getroffen. Dasnkleine Mädchen begann wieder zu weinen und erklärte unter Tränen:\"nIch weiß es nicht. Ich weiß nur noch, dass ich in einem von diesennWagen war und dann kamen Männer und die haben geschossen undngeschrien und dann bin ich von dem Wagen heruntergefallen und esnwurde alles schwarz. Dann bin ich aufgewacht und saß unter dem Wagennhier und niemand war mehr da. Keine Männer und auch meine Elternnnicht.\" Erst jetzt sah Paula die Beule auf der Stirn des Kindes.n\"Kadlynn, pass mal auf, ich setz dich jetzt auf mein Pferd und dasnbind ich dann da drüben dran, damit es nicht weglaufen kann.\" Siendeutet auf eine kleinen verdorrten Busch, ein paar Meter weiter. \"Ichnschau mich solang mal ein bisschen in der Gegend um. Bleib auf jedennFall auf dem Pferd, und wenn du jemanden siehst, oder ein Tier kommt,ndann schreist du und dann komm ich zurück, ok?\" Das kleine Mädchennnickte folgsam und Paula setzt sie auf das Pferd. \"Du kannst dir janinzwischen schon mal einen Namen für das Pferd ausdenke, es ist einnMädchen.\" Mit diesen Worten, ging sie zu dem Pferd, setzte Kadlynnndarauf und führte das Pferd zu dem kleinen Busch. Dort band sie esnmit den Zügeln locker an und ging zurück zu den Wagen. Was siendort fand, ließ sie schaudern. Es lagen 8 Leichen dahinter, auf dennersten Blick nicht zu sehen. Sie wollte sie nicht berühren, aber sienging davon aus, dass sie ausgeraubt und dann ermordet worden waren.nWie Kadlynn überlebt hatte, war ihr ein Rätsel. Doch bald schobennsich ganz anderen Fragen in ihren Kopf. Wie war sie überhauptnhierher gekommen? Und wo war hier? Wie kam sie wieder zurück? Wasnpassierte bei ihr zuhause? Sie war zuerst ganz auf das kleine Mädchennfixiert gewesen, dass es zu retten galt, aber jetzt schweiften ihrenGedanken ab. Bald aber bleiben sie wieder bei dem Rätsel desnMädchens hängen. Sie ging zurück, um die Wagen herum und zu ihremnPferd. Das kleine Mädchen blickte sie erwartungsvoll an. \"Und, wasnhast du alles gesehen?\" fragte es neugierig. \"Ach, nichtsnwichtiges, nur eure kaputten Wagen und die Landschaft. Wie heißtnmein Pferd denn jetzt?\" versuchte sie das Mädchen abzulenken. Sienbrachte es nicht übers Herz, ihr die Wahrheit zu sagen. Kadlynn gingnauch sofort darauf ein. \"Sie heißt Annabell.\" sagte sienfröhlich. Paula stöhnte innerlich auf. Annabell, so konnte man dochnkeine Pferd nennen. Laut sagte sie:\" Das ist ein wunderschönernName, Kaddy. Am besten wir reiten jetzt mal irgendwohin, vielleichtnkommen ja sonst diese Männer wieder. Ich würde sagen wir reiten dasnzu diesem Streifen Grün.\" \"Okay.\" sagte die Kleine und schautensie erwartungsvoll an. Paula schaute das Pferd an und es kam ihrnziemlich groß vor. Sie hatte keine Angst vor Pferden, nur Respekt.nZuhause hatte sie sich gern mit Pferden beschäftigt, nut viel zunselten um sagen zu können, sie könne reiten. Und aufsteigen hattensie noch nie gut gekonnt. Aber sie trat an das Tier heran, fasste vornKaddy an den Sattelknauf, stieg mit dem Fuß in den Steigbügel undnzog sich irgendwie hoch. Sie war sich sichre, es hatte nicht sonelegant gewirkt aber sie würde das bestimmt noch irgendwann malnlernen, sch auf die Pferde zu schwingen wie die großennWesternhelden. Sie saß hinter Kaddy auf Annabell und sie rittenngemeinsam Richtung Wald, oder was diese Grüne auch immer seinnmochte. Kadlynn schaute sich den ganze Weg interessiert um und fragtenPaula dabei über ihr Leben aus. Es war später Abend und die Sonnenging grade unter als Paula eine Felsenformation sah, die aussah, alsnwäre sie wie geschaffen für einen Lagerplatz. Die Felsen hatten inneinem größeren Kreis gruppiert, der eine kleine Öffnung zeigt, aufnder Seite, die zu ihnen hin zeigte. Ein großer Felsen stand genaungegenüber der Öffnung. Er hatte einen kleinen Überhang, der einnDach über einer kleinen Senke bildete. Sie hielt an und wollte gradenKadlynn herunterheben, als sie sah, dass das kleine Mädchen dienAugen geschlossen hatte und friedlich schlief. Sie nahm sie ganznbehutsam in ihre Arme und trug sie zu der kleinen Senke hin. Dortnlegte sie den kleine Körper vorsichtig auf den Boden. Kaddlyn regtensich etwas, wachte aber nicht auf. Dann führte sie ihr Pferd in dennSteinkreis und schaute in die Satteltaschen. Darin war Brot,nDörrfleisch, zwei volle Wasserschläuche, Präriefeuerzeug und zweinDecken. Sie war nicht mehr erstaunt, nachdem was an diesem seltsamennTag alles geschehen war. Sie nahm eine der Decken und legte sie inndie Senke, als Unterlag für Kaddy. Dann legte sie Kaddy vorsichtigndarauf und deckte sie mit der zweiten Decke zu. Das Mädchen öffnetenverschlafen die Augen. \"Wo sind wir?\" \"Alles ist gut, schlafneinfach weiter\" redete Paula mit beruhigender Stimme auf sie ein.nSie schloss die Augen wieder und schlief bald darauf tief und fest.nDie Ältere dachte daran, auch zu schlafen, doch dann fiel ihr ein,nwas nachts alles schreckliches an Tieren aus ihren Höhlen kam. Sienkletterte also mit einiger Mühe auf den felsigen Überhang undnbeschloss, diese Nacht Wache zu halten. Sie lehnet sich an den Felsennund begann leise ein paar Lieder zu singen, die ihr durch den Kopfngingen. So merkte sie nicht einmal, dass sie später in der Nacht inneinen tiefen, ruhigen Schlaf fiel.[Chapter 3] Sienwachte auf, als die ersten Sonnenstrahlen ihr Gesicht kitzelten. Sienwar sofort wach und verfluchte sich innerlich dafür, dass sieneingeschlafen war, hoffentlich war Kaddy nichts passiert. Doch dannnspürte sie etwas Warmes auf ihrem Schoss und sah das kleine Mädchennan sich geschmiegt. Sie musste irgendwann in der Nacht zu ihrnhochgeklettert sein. Sie tippte sie die Kleine leicht an der Schulternan und sagte sanft:\" Aufstehen Süße, es gibt Frühstück.\"nKaddy rieb sich verschlafen die Augen und sagte:\" Ich will nochnnicht aufstehen.\" Paula lachte und erwiderte:\" Dann musst dunheute wohl ohne Frühstück losreiten.\" \"Wohin wollen wir den?\"n\"Erstmal dahinten zu dem Wald. Wir müssen jemanden finden, der unsnsagen kann, wo wir sind und uns vielleicht helfen kann.\" Kaddlynngähnte herzhaft und stand dann auf. Paula kletterte von dernPlattform und hob sie dann runter. Dann frühstückten sie etwas Brotnund ein bisschen Dörrfleisch. Als es nach Paulas Schätzung etwa 8nUhr sein musste, brachen sie auf. Sie packten das provisorische Lagernzusammen und ritten weiter in Richtung des Grünstreifens, der amnHorizont nur unwesentlich größer geworden war. Auch heute war Kaddynwieder voller Lebensfreude. Sie setzte ihre Befragung vom Vortag fortnund gab sich nicht mit Ausflüchten zufrieden. Paula redete dennganzen Vormittag fast ununterbrochen. Als die Sonne am höchstennstand und Kadlynn ein Pause in ihrem Kreuzfeuer aus Fragen gemachtnhatte, sagte Paula:\" Ich denke wir sollten anhalten, noch mal etwasntrinken und auch Annabell etwas geben. Wir müssen uns alle einenkurze Zeit ausruhen.\" Sie machten ein kurze Rast und ritten dannnweiter. Am frühen Nachmittag kamen ihnen Reiter entgegen. Paulansagte zu Kaddy:\" Die können wir fragen wo wir sind.\" und sienhielten auf sie zu. Als die Reiter allerdings näher kamen, wünschtensich Paula sie hätten einen großen Bogen um sie gemacht. Es warennschmierige Kerle und als sie sahen, das Paula eine Frau war, wurdenihr Grinsen anzüglich bis ekelhaft. Sie nahmen die Hände von ihrennGewehren und kam langsam näher. Paula ließ ihre Hand auf demnRevolver ruhen, die ebenfalls in ihren Satteltaschen gesteckt hattenund die sie in ihren Gürtel gesteckt hatte. Die Kerle riefen ihrnzu:\" Nimm die Hand von deinem Schießeisen weg, du kannst doch ehnnicht damit umgehen. Wir kommen in Frieden.\" Paula rief zurück:\"nDass ich nicht damit umgehen kann, macht es für euch nur nochnkritischer denke ich.\" und ließ ihre Hand wo sie war. Die Kerlengefielen ihr ganz und gar nicht. Einer von ihnen, der der Anführernzu sein schien, rief lachend seinen Kameraden zu:\" Temperament hatndie Kleine auch noch.\" Paula erwiderte kühl:\" Wir wolltenneigentlich nur fragen, wo wir sind und wie wir zur nächsten Stadtnkommen.\" Der Anführer lachte wieder und sagte:\" Ihr wisst nichtnwo ihr seid. Das ist komisch. Aber ihr habt Glück, ich bin Peppersnund ich kenne die Gegend hier ziemlich gut. Ich werde euch zurnnächsten Stadt bringen, für eine kleine Gegenleistung verstehtnsich.\" \"Wir haben kein Geld.\" \"Ich hatte da auch eher an wasnanderes gedacht, Puppe.\" Der Kerl grinste noch anzüglicher undnseine Kameraden lachten. Paula war nahe daran, zu würgen. \"Wennndas so ist, finden wir den Weg auch allein. Goodbye Gentelmen.\" Mitndiesen Worten wollte sie Annabell an den Fremden vorbeilenken dochndiese kreisten sie ein. Kaddy hatte die Männer die ganze Zeit mitngroßen Augen angestarrt und kein Wort gesagt. Nun flüsterte sie:\"nWas wollen diese Männer? Wieso lassen sich uns nicht vorbei?\" \"Sienlassen uns gleich vorbei, ich denke ich kann das klären.\" redetenPaula beruhigend auf das Mädchen ein. Peppers sagte plötzlich:\"nJetzt sei doch nicht so zickig Kleine, wir wollen doch nur einnbisschen Spaß haben und du doch auch. Wahrscheinlich bist du nochnkeinem richtigen Mann begegnet, weil du so verklemmt bist. Wir zeigenndir, wies geht.\" \"Ihr seid ekelhaft!\" schleuderte Paula ihnennentgegen. \"Lasst uns vorbei.\" Sie versuchte an Peppers und seinennMännern vorbei zu kommen aber sie griffen ihr in die Zügel undnrissen Kaddy von ihr weg. Diese begann zu weinen. Peppers warf sie zuneinem anderen Mann, der sie auffing. Kaddy wehret sich, biss undnkratzte und trat um sich, doch als der Manns sie schlug, war sienstill und schluchzte nur noch leise vor sich hin. Paula rief in PaniknPeppers zu:\" Lasst sie in Ruhe, sie ist doch noch ein Kind,nverdammt.\" \"Bitte\", fügte sie dann leiser hinzu. \"Ich denkenso kommen wir doch ins Geschäft, Puppe. \" Sagte Peppers, immernnoch ein Grinsen auf dem Gesicht. \"Ich denke ihr zwei werdet erstneinmal mit uns kommen. Bindet ihr die Hände zusammen und bringt sienzu mir. Breggins, du nimmst ihr Pferd mit.\" Sie wollte sich wehren,ndoch mit einem Blick auf Kaddlyn, die immer noch festgehalten wurde,ndie Augen vor Angst weit aufgerissen, besann sie sich anders undnleistete keinen Widerstand als man ihr die Hände vor der Brustnzusammenband, ihr ihre Waffen abnahm und sie zu Peppers auf Pferdnsetzte. Sie ritten los, in die Richtung aus der sie gekommen warennund Paula konnte nichts machen. Sie konnte nichts machen und fühltensich hilflos. Sie hatte Kadlynn retten wollen und hatte sie in nurnnoch größere Gefahr gebracht und es gab keine Hoffnung auf Rettung,nda sich noch nicht einmal wusste wo, geschweige denn in welcher Zeitnsie sich befand. Alles in allem war ihre Lage ziemlich schlecht. Siengrübelte den ganzen Weg darüber nach, was sie tun könnte, bis sienAbends ihr Lager aufschlugen. Nach einem kargen Abendessen, dass fürnsie nur aus einem Stück Brot und ein paar schlucken Wasser bestandennhatte, band man Kadlynn zum Schlafen die Hände zusammen, damit sienPaula nicht befreien konnte und legte die beiden Mädchen auf dennBoden nahe dem Feuer, was die Kerle gemacht hatte. Sie hörten wiensich diese lautstark unterhielten und lachten. Kaddy schmiegte sichnan Paula und flüsterte ihr ins Ohr:\" Ich hab Angst. Was wollen dienvon uns? Wieso haben die uns gefesselt?\" \"Süße, du brauchstnkeine Angst zu haben, es wird jemand kommen und uns retten.\" Selbstnwenn Paula selbst nicht viel Hoffnung hatte so durfte sie doch nichtnzulassen, das Kadlynn diese verlor. \"Und wer?\" Kadlynn schautensie zweifeln an. \" Also ich erzähl dir mal von zwei Helden. Undndie werden uns auch retten.\" Und sie begann im Flüsterton zunerzählen:\" Es gibt zwei Männer die sind sehr gut befreundet, sienlieben sich wie Brüder. Sie reiten auf Pferden, die Brüder sind,nund beide schnell wie der Wind und schwarz wie die Nacht. Der einnMann ist ein Weißer und der andere ist ein Indianer. Der Weiße hatnblonde Haare und ist groß, aber kein Riese. Er kann mit einemneinzigen Fausthieb einen einzigen Menschen niederschlagen und hatnsehr viel Kraft. Deswegen wird er auch Old Shatterhand genannt, dasnbedeute Alte Schmetterhand. Er ist selbst zu seinem schlimmsten Feindnnoch gerecht und freundlich und tötet nur im allergrößten Notfallnund auch dann nur ungern. Er kommt aus Deutschland, wo auch ichnherkomme und ist ziemlich klug. Außerdem ist er in allem sehr gut,nwas man im Wilden Westen so braucht. Spurenlesen, anschleichen,nreiten und mit Waffen umgehen. Aber alles was er als Westmann, sonnennt man das, kann, hat er von Winnetou gelernt. Winnetou ist seinnLehrer und sein Freund zugleich. Er ist nicht zu groß aber auchnnicht klein, muskulös aber nicht bullig sondern eher schlank undnwendig. Sein Stamm sind die Mesacalero-Apatschen, und er ist ihrnHäuptling. Er ist Meister in den Künsten des Westen und keiner istndarin besser als er. Seine Schwester und sein Vater sind von einemnbösen Mann getötet worden nun will er sie rächen, aber er ist auchngerecht. Er ist nicht ganz so menschenfreundlich wie Old Shatterhandnaber auch er tötet nicht ohne einen wirklich guten Grund. Diesenbeiden werden kommen und uns retten und uns helfen, hier zurecht zunkommen. Aber schlaf jetzt kleine Maus, du musst morgen ausgeruhtnsein, es wird ein anstrengender Ritt.\" Damit schloss Paula und sahnauf Kadlynn hinab. Direkt nach ihren letzten Worten waren ihr dienAugen zugefallen und sie war in einen ruhigen Schlafnhinübergeglitten. Paula wünschte sich, auch einfach einschlafen zunkönnen, aber sie musste noch über so viel nachdenken. Doch kaum,ndass sie ein bequeme Position gefunden hatte, war auch sieneingeschlafen.[Chapter 4] Amnnächsten Morgen wurde sie durch lautes Stimmengewirr geweckt. Sienschaute sich um und suchte nach Kaddy. Bald entdeckte sie sie bei demnKerl, der auch gestern mit ihr geritten war, doch das beruhigte sienkeineswegs. Sie sprang auf, was sich mit ihren gefesselten Händennals etwas schwierig erwies, ihr aber dann doch gelang, und ging zunPeppers hinüber, der gerade seine Satteltaschen packte. \"Ich mussnmit dir reden.\" Peppers bedeutet ihr mit einem Kopfnicken, dass siensprechen sollte. \"Ihr müsst Kaddy in Ruhe lassen. Sie ist dochnnoch ein Kind. Lasst mich mit ihr auf unserem Pferd reiten. Ich binndoch gefesselt und kann so nicht fliehen.\" Peppers drehte sichnlangsam um. \"Glaubst du ehrlich, dass ich das tun würde? Dunwürdest fliehen, Fesseln hin oder her. Es bleibt so wies es jetztnist. Basta!\" Paula war wütend. Sie konnte einfach nicht gut genugnlügen. Etwas, was sie zuhause so gut wie nie gebraucht hatte. nResignierend ging sie zu Kaddy und ihrem Aufpasser. \"Guten Morgen,nSüße.\" Begrüßte sie das kleine Mädchen. \"Guten Morgen.\"nsagte die Kleine ängstlich und schaute zu dem Kerl hoch, der hinternihr stand. 'Soweit ist es also schon gekommen, nur von dem kurzennRitt gestern. Sie hat schon Angst ob sie das richtige sagt. Wirnmüssen fliehen. Irgendwie' dachte Paula bei sich. Laut sagte sie:\"nUnd Kleine, hast du gut geschlafen?\" \"Ja hab ich.\" \"Okay dannnist ja gut. Ich denke wir werden jetzt weiterreiten, ich geh dann malnzurück zu Peppers.\" Sie lächelte Kaddy so optimistisch an, wiensie nur konnte und ging dann hinüber, wo Peppers bereits reisefertignauf seinem Pferd saß und nur noch auf sie wartete \"Peppers, ichnbin gefesselt, so komm ich nicht auf das Pferd\" sagte sie. Er stiegnherunter und hob sie grob auf das Pferd, dann stieg er hinter ihrnauf. Paula hatte das dringende Bedürfnis, sich so weit wie möglichnvon ihm zu entfernen, aber auf dem Pferderücken war das leider nichtnmöglich. Als sie losgeritten waren, versuchte sie noch einmalnPeppers davon zu überzeugen, nicht zu hart mit Kaddy zu sein. \"Dasnwas du willst ist doch eigentlich mein Körper. Wenn ich dir den alsonohne Widerstand anbiete, wirst du Kadlynn dann in Ruhe lassen? Dunbrauchst sie doch nicht. Bitte.\" Peppers antwortete nur lachend:\"nNatürlich brauche ich sie, um etwas gegen dich in der Hand zu habennSüße. Außerdem, wenn du nicht mitmachst, macht das ganze ja nurnhalb soviel Spaß.\" Das einzige, was Paula dazu einfiel, war: \"Dunbist ein ekeliges, perverses Schwein.\" \"Ich denke du solltestndich mit solchen Aussagen lieber zurückhalten, doch willst dochnnicht, dass deiner kleinen Freundin was passiert.\", sagte Peppers,nnun mit einem drohenden Unterton. \"Nein, dass will ich nicht.\"nPaula gab äußerlich klein bei aber in ihrem Inneren kochte sie vornZorn. Was erlaubte sich dieser gemeine Bastard eigentlich? Sie mussteneine Lösung finden, von ihm wegzukommen, sonst würde Kaddy nur nochnmehr leiden müssen. Der Rest des Vormittags verlief relativnereignislos. Gegen Mittag machte sie an einem kleine Wasser halt, umndie Pferde zu tränken und selbst zu trinken. Sie und Kaddy bekamennauch ein paar Schlucke Wasser und dann ging es weiter. Kurze Zeitndanach, sahen sie in der Ferne drei kleine schwarze Punkte, dienlangsam näher kamen, schon bald die Größe von Hunden annahmen undnschließlich als drei Reiter zu erkennen waren. Soweit Paula dasnbeurteilen konnte, waren es zwei Indianer und ein Weißer, was sienaus der Haarfarbe der Reiter geschlossen hatte. Sie konnte den Keimnder Hoffnung nicht ersticken, der in ihr wuchs. Zwei der Pferde warennschwarz, und zwar das des Weißen und das eines Indianers. Winnetounund Old Shatterhand, schoss es ihr durch den Kopf doch sie verbotnsich den Gedanken sofort wieder. Es wäre zu schön um wahr zu sein.nAußerdem war es völlig unmöglich. Die beiden Blutsbrüder warennfiktive Charaktere aus einem Buch, sie konnten nicht plötzlichnirgendwo aufzutauchen., kaum dass sie in Gefahr geraten war. DienReiter kamen näher und jetzt nahmen die Männer ihre Büchsen zunHand. Auch unsere Aufpasser griffen nach den Waffen. Peppers rief,nals die Reiter bis auf Rufweite herangekommen waren, zu:\" Kommt ihrnin Frieden?\" \"Ja, Gentelmen, steckt eure Büchsen ruhig weg.\"nrief der Weiße. Paula konnte nun ihre Gesichter erkennen und ihrnHerz machte einen kleine Sprung. Diese beiden Männer, die gerade aufnsie zugeritten kamen, sahen genauso aus, wie Karl May sie immer innseinen Bücher beschrieben hatte. War das vielleicht ein Dreh fürneinen Film oder etwas in der Art und sie waren da hinein geraten? DienLeichen, die sie gefunden hatte, hatten echt ausgesehen und auchnPeppers und seinen Leute benahmen sich nicht grade wie Schauspieler.nAber sie schob ihren Fragen und Zweifel beiseite und wandte sich dernBetrachtung des dritten der Gefährten zu. Dieser war ein jungernIndianer, vielleicht 16 oder 17 Jahre alt, aber er hatte dienAusstrahlung eines erfahrenen Kriegers. Sein Gesicht war schön, inneinem glänzenden Bronze. Seine Gesichtszüge waren weicher, als esnbei Indianer normalerweise der Fall war und er schaute ihnen mitnintelligenten grünen Augen, bei den Indianern eine ungewöhnlichenFarbe, entgegen, die ärgerlich aufblitzen, als er Peppers und michnsah, und dann auch Kaddy. Als die Reiter bei ihnen angekommen waren,nergriff der Weiße wieder das Wort:\" Goodday Gents, Ich bin Parkernund das sind meine Begleiter Yakonpi-Topa und Tschia-Nitsas.\"nDürfen wir nun erfahren, wer ihr seid und was eure seltsamenBegleitung zu bedeuten hat?\" Peppers antwortete nicht sogleich,nsondern unterzog alle drei einer genauen Musterung. Dann breitetensich ein Grinsen auf seinem Gesicht aus. \"Ich bin Peppers und dasnsind meine Freunde. Zu unsere Begleitung, wir haben diese beidennjungen Damen unterwegs aufgelesen und wollten sie in die nächstenStadt bringen.\" \"Und wieso ist die Ältere gefesselt?\" fragtender Weiße zweifelnd. \"Ihr Geisteszustand ist nicht grad der beste,nsie ist ein wenig verwirrt. Wir mussten sie fesseln, um zu vermeiden,ndass sie sich selber wehtut.\" Er stieß Paula von hintennunauffällig an, doch diese war sicher, Old Shatterhand, sie gingneinfach mal davon aus, dass er/sein Schauspieler es war, hatte esntrotzdem gesehen. Sie wusste, Peppers wollte ihr bedeuten, still zunsein, da sie sonst in Schwierigkeiten kommen könnte, aber genau dasnwar es, was sie nicht tun wollte. Peppers zog wahrscheinlich garnnicht in Betracht, sie könnte sich gegen in auflehnen und wennnglaubte er, diese drei Männer könnten gegen seine Zehn sowiesonnichts ausrichten. Aber jetzt sagte Paula laut und deutlich:\" Wasner sagt, stimmt nicht. Er hat uns gefangen genommen, um mich zunvergewaltigen und Kadlynn\", sie deutete mit den gefesselten Händennauf sie, \"als Druckmittel zu benutzen, damit ich mich nicht wehre.\"nPeppers presste mir eine Hand auf den Mund und Paula biss hinein,nworaufhin er sie schnell wieder zurückzog. Dann sagte er, an OldnShatterhand gewandt:\" Sie redet Unsinn, beachtet sie nicht weiter.nWir werden jetzt weiterreiten.\" Doch Old Shatterhand erwiderte:\"nEinen Moment noch, Peppers. Mir erscheint die Version des Mädchensnsehr viel glaubwürdiger als eure. Ich denke, wir werden die beidennMädchen in die nächste Stadt bringen.\" Peppers meinte daraufhinnschnell:\" Nein, nein, mir liegt das Wohl der beiden sehr am Herzennund ich werde sie jetzt nicht einfach Wildfremden übergeben. \" OldnShatterhand überlegte eine Weile und sagte dann:\" Nun gut Gents,nwenn ihr darauf besteht, die beiden weiterhin zu begleiten, wollennwir euch nicht im Wege stehen. Goodbye.\" Er lenkte sein Pferd annihnen vorbei und der Ältere der beiden Indianer, wahrscheinlichnWinnetou, folgte ihm schweigend. Jüngere zögerte kurz, folgte dannnaber seinen Gefährten. Die Hoffnung in Paula erlosch, als hätte manneine Kerze ausgeblasen. Sie konnten doch nicht einfach weg reiten undnsie in der Gewalt dieser Leute lassen. Bald waren sie in der Fernenverschwunden und sie setzten ihren Weg fort. Paula wusste, Peppersnwürde es nicht unbeachtet lassen, dass sie ihn verraten hatte. Sienhoffte er würde Kaddy diesmal da raus lassen aber sie glaubte nichtnwirklich daran. Er war ohne Skrupel. Abends machten sie Halt an einemnkleinen Bach, der von Grün umgeben war. Peppers stieß sie grob vomnPferd und sie schlug heftig mit dem Kopf auf, das sie ihren Sturz jannicht mit den Händen abfangen konnten. Einen kurzen Moment sah sienSterne, da wurde sie wieder hochgerissen und Peppers befahl:\"nBindet sie dort an den Baum. Mit dem Rücken zu mir.\" Ihr schwantenübles; er würde sie doch nicht schlagen, nicht hier vor KaddysnAugen. Doch es war anscheinend genau das, was er vorhatte. Er holtenseine Reitpeitsche und kam auf den Baum zu, an dem sie mittlerweilenfestgebunden war. Paula sagte in bittendem Tonfall:\" Peppers, wennnihr mich schlagen wollt, bin ich davon auch nicht grade begeistertnaber bitte bringt Kaddy vorher weg.\" \"Oh nein, das wird sowohlndich als auch sie lehren, dass man mich nicht verrät.\" Sie flehtennun beinahe:\" Schafft sie weg, bitte, ich bitte euch.\" \"Nein.\"nPaula rief Kaddy zu:\" Mach die Augen zu. Und lass sie zu bis ichndir sage du darfst sie aufmachen.\" Ein böses Grinsen erschien aufnPeppers Gesicht. \"Wenn du die Augen zu machst, wird Paula nur nochnmehr leiden müssen, und das willst du doch nicht, oder?\" Kadlynnnschüttelte den Kopf, die Augen starr auf Paula gerichtet. Diese sahnzurück und legte ihre Zuversicht in diesen einen Blick. Was dasnMädchen jetzt sehen würde, würde sie zutiefst verstören und sienmusste versuchen, den Schaden einzudämmen. Dann stand Peppers direktnhinter ihr und schwang die Peitsche. 5 mal schlug er zu undnschmerzende Streifen zogen sich über Paulas Rücken. Sie versuchte,nruhig zu bleiben und Kaddy und die Männer nicht sehen zu lassen, wasnfür Schmerzen sie litt. Bei jedem Schlag zuckte sie zusammen undnwimmerte leise. Als Peppers aufhörte, sie zu schlagen, sackte sienzusammen und verlor das Bewusstsein. Als sie erwachte, war es dunkelnum sie her und sie spürte Kaddy an sich geschmiegt, sie weinte leisenim Schlaf. Ihr Rücken schmerzte höllisch und ihr T-Shirt klebte annihren offenen Wunden. Sie bewegte sich vorsichtig und Kaddy wachtenauf. \"Paula, du lebst.\" \"Na klar leb ich, wieso sollte ich totnsein?\" fragte sie etwas erstaunt. Kaddy sagte:\" Du hast dich dienganze Zeit nicht bewegt und dein Rücken hat gar nicht aufgehört zunbluten.\" \"Ach Kleine, das ist nichts, mach dir keine Sorgen, esntut schon fast nicht mehr weh. \" Paula versuchte sie abzulenken,nauch wenn das wohl nicht der geschickteste Weg war:\" Warum hast dungeweint, im Schlaf, hast du schlecht geträumt?\" \"Ich hab von dennbösen Männern geträumt und das sie gekommen wären und dichngetötet hätten und mich auch töten wollten\" sagte Kaddy. \"Dasnwird nicht passieren, kleine Maus, du wirst sehen, Old Shatterhandnund Winnetou kommen noch, sie werden uns retten.\" versuchte Paulander Kleinen und auch sich selbst Mut zuzusprechen. \"Aber siensollten sich lieber mal beeilen.\" murmelte sie noch leise, dannnsagte sie zu Kaddy:\" Ich denke du solltest jetzt schlafen. Allesnwird gut.\" Kaddy kuschelte sich wieder an Paula uns schlief baldnwieder. Paula dachte noch eine Weile über das Geschehene nach, dasnwollte auch sie versuchen zu schlafen, als sie plötzlich im Gebüschnhinter sich ein leises Rascheln hörte. Sie spähte hinter sich undnsah im Gebüsch zwei schwach leuchtende Punkte. Es waren Augen. Einenleise, wohlklingende Stimme sagte in fließendem Englisch:\" Bewegtneuch nicht und seht nicht zu mir hin. Ich bin Taschunko und komme umneuch zu retten.\" Paula starrte ihn an und sagte dann ebenso leise:\"nUns sind die Hände auf den Rücken gefesselt und alle unsere Sachennsind bei unserem Pferd.\" Er flüsterte:\" Ich schneide euch dienFesseln durch. Haltet mir die Hände hin. Euer Pferd habe ich bereitsngeholt.\" Tiefe Bewunderung stieg in Paula auf. Er war erst so jungnund vollbrachte schon solche Glanzstücke. Dann rüttelte sie Kaddynsacht an der Schulter und flüsterte dem Mädchen zu:\" AufwachennKaddy. Jemand ist gekommen um uns zu retten. Aber du musst leisensein, damit die bösen Männer uns nicht hören.\" Kaddy war sofortnwach, sie hatte ja kaum eine halbe Stunde geschlafen. Sie erkantenTaschunko und verstand, das es wichtig war, dass sie keinen Laut vonnsich gab. Taschunko kroch ihnen voraus in die Büsche, dann kam Kaddynund dann Paula. Sie versuchte so leise und unfällig zu sein wienmöglich, war sich aber sicher, dass es ihr nicht wirklich gutngelang. Irgendwann stand Tash auf und Paula nahm an, sie könntennjetzt vom Lager nicht mehr gesehen werden. Ihr Retter nahm Kaddy aufnden Arm, half ihr hoch und lief dann mit großen Schritten in dienNacht hinaus. Sie folgte ihm so gut es ging. Bald hörten sie Rufenhinter sich. Peppers hatte gemerkt, dass sie entkommen waren.nTaschunko schritt noch schneller aus. In dem Versuch ihm zu folgennstolperte sie immer öfter, konnte sich aber immer wieder fangen.nPlötzlich knickte sie mit einem leisen Schmerzenslaut ein. Sie hattensich den Knöchel verstaucht. Sie konnte nicht mehr auftreten und esntat höllisch weh. Sie sagte zu Taschunko:\" Bring Kaddy innSicherheit. Ich komme langsam nach.\" Doch er schüttelte den Kopf:\"nNein, das kann ich nicht machen. Du kommst mit, es ist nicht mehrnweit.\" \"Bitte bringt sie weg, ich halte euch nur auf. Sie werdennuns einholen. Wenn ihr schnell das Pferd erreicht, könnt ihr michndamit abholen. Geht jetzt.\" Widerstrebend drehte Taschunko sich umnund rannte weiter in das Dunkel. Sie blieb erschöpft stehen. IhrnKnöchel schmerzte furchtbar. Sie sah helle Punkte die näher kamen.nFackeln. Gleich würden sie sie gefunden haben. Sie konnte nurnhoffen, dass Tash Kaddy in Sicherheit gebracht hatte. ","Summary":" Hey,nschön dass ich euch hier zu meiner Geschichte verirrt habt. Dies istnmeine erste Fanfic und zu"},{"Movie":"Willard","Title":"Willard: Invocation of the Beast","Author":"Darth Gilthoron","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1811557","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sheepdog Standing in the rain Bullfrog Doing it again Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles What makes you think you're something special when you smile? The Beatles, Hey Bulldog There was a young man on the doorstep,rnalmost a boy, certainly not older than twenty, and the colour of his facernimplied that he might not have had a bath for at least a quarter of that time,rnbut, strangely, he was very neatly shaved. He had greasy black hair that hungrndown to his shoulders in wild strands. His jeans were torn at both knees, thernsleeveless jacket he wore was an indefinable shade of grey, the shirtrnunderneath at the point of falling apart. The smell about him was not as muchrnbad as… odd. Like a cat that even shied the cleaning of its own tongue. And, ofrncourse, there was the cat, rubbing against his heavy boots. It was a medium-sized grey tiger, a ratherrncommon animal. Yet its eyes were special. They radiated a kind of… sapientrnboredom… which should definitely not be found in a cat's eyes. \"I'm a friend of Willard Stiles's\",rnthe young man said. \"And so, I believe, are you.\" What was it he wanted? Despite his appearance,rnhe certainly was no beggar. There was a definite sense of pride in hisrnattitude. And the cat wouldn't be following him if he treated it badly. So hernwas probably kind to animals. \"This is Hector\", he said. \"Yournown cats yourself, do you? There's that pretty red one, Cassandra, I believe,rnwho recently had kittens, isn't it so? You gave one of them to Willard, didn'trnyou? It was Scully, if I remember it correctly. Hector's the father, yournsee.\" He bent down to scratch the grey tiger's ears. \"Yes, and you'rernCathryn, I'm pretty sure of it.\" Finally she found her voice again. \"How dornyou know all this?\" \"Because I'm a friend of Willard's.\"rnHe grinned. \"Willard has no friends\", she saidrnautomatically, before she could stop herself. \"Yeah, that's what he thinks. Always beenrna loner, Willard. Until he found the pack. Yet I doubt that a rat makes a goodrnfriend. I'm more the cat type myself.\" \"Yes, I can see that\", Cathryn said,rnmarvelling at Hector's intelligent eyes. This stranger might be weird, but hernliked cats. To her, someone who liked cats couldn't possibly be a scoundrel. But someone who liked rats… No, she would notrnthink of it. Not again. \"How do you know about me and myrncats?\" she asked instead. And about Willard, she mentally added. Does itrnshow on my face? The Girl Who Almost Went Out With The Rat-tamer ? ThernGirl Who Almost Went Out With A Murderer ? Yes, I did like him. Butrnhow could I have known… ? \"Oh, I know about every cat in thernneighbourhood.\" He beamed at her. \"Cats are my passion. That's wherernI got my name, too. People call me Tomcat.\" \"Tomcat\", Cathryn repeated. \"Dornyou live around here?\" \"Recently, I do. Hector likes to be aroundrnCassandra for some reason.\" Again he grinned. \"But that doesn't meanrnanything. I live everywhere, you see, and nowhere. I'm a stray.\" A stray, Cathryn thought. How strange. Yourncould call a runaway cat a stray. A stray tomcat… \"Even though my appearance speaks outrnagainst me\", he smiled awkwardly, \"I must ask you to trust me. I needrnyour help.\" \"What exactly do you want?\" shernasked, suspicious. This was getting even more peculiar than it had looked inrnthe beginning. \"It's about Willard\", he answeredrnpromptly. \"With a little bit of help from me and my friends, he'll be freernin no time.\" \"And you want to hide him somewhere\",rnshe said, guessing where this was leading. He raised his eyebrows. \"Yournfrightened?\" \"Of the police?\" she shot back.rn\"No, because I-\" \"No, of Willard.\" Cathryn hesitated. She recalled the moment whenrnthe revelation had hit her, when she had finally understood what he had done.rnHad she been afraid then? Shocked, of course, but afraid? She recalled the fearrnin his eyes as he had called her, as he had begged her for help… Had she beenrnafraid then? Afraid of what? Of him? Of the rats? Of the police, and of whatrnthey would think of her? \"You believe he's mad, don't you?\"rnTomcat asked, obviously taking her silence for a yes. \"I'll tell yournsomething: That's just what the people say. But they have no damn idea!\"rnHe scowled, and for a moment a look of utter ferocity crossed his face. But asrnCathryn looked again, it had disappeared, and she assumed that she had merelyrnbeen imagining it. \"Sane as any man, Willard Stiles. To be exact, a wholernlot saner. I mean, look at Frank Martin, the bloody bastard. Would you call himrna better man than Willard, only because he has – used to have an entire firm inrnhis hand and an expensive car and a damn big house and a great big lot ofrnmoney? Obsessed madman, he was. Nothing more. How I wish Willard had killed arnlot more of that blood-sucking sort.\" Oh no, Cathryn thought, not some kind ofrnleft-wing anarchist lecturing me on social injustice! He's right about Martinrnbeing a bastard, but I hate it when they get ideological about it! \"Yeah, right, you can't really comparernit\", Tomcat admitted when he saw the look on Cathryn's face. \"Thatrnhe's got money has nothing to do with it.\" Cathryn suppressed a sigh ofrnrelief. \"But he was still a maniac. And Willard isn't! He's just fine!rnThey only locked him up because they're afraid of his talents. People arernalways afraid of what they can't explain. Believe me, I know it wellrnenough.\" Here he stopped himself, but Cathryn had the clear impressionrnthat there was something more he wanted to say. \"Can I count on you?\"rnhe inquired. Cathryn sighed heavily. What should she say?rn\"Now look, Tomcat-\" \"I know\", he cut her off. \"It'srna significant and hard decision, and it's maybe a bit too much to decide inrnsuch a short time. Look, I fully understand if it's a problem for you. But Irnwon't force you. I wouldn't want to endanger you. After all\", here he gavernher a little wink, \"you're a lover of cats.\" Surprised at his sudden understanding, Cathrynrnnodded. \"Can I think about it?\" \"Sure\", Tomcat answered. \"We'verngot some business in the area anyway, Hector and I. Haven't we, Hector?\" Looking up at its master, the cat mewed softly. Tomcat nodded knowingly, just as if the greyrntiger had just informed him of something. \"I see. If you'd excuse him,rnCathryn… He'd like to see Cassandra for a minute. D'you mind?\" Withoutrnwaiting for an answer, he called: \"Cassandra! Visitor!\" Cathryn opened her mouth to tell him to stoprnbeing silly, but had to shut it again as her red cat brushed past her legrnpurring and sniffed Hector before starting to lick his ears affectionately. While Cathryn stared, thunderstruck, Tomcatrnkneeled down and ran a hand over Cassandra's head. \"Well, it's been somerntime\", he said softly, as if speaking to the cat. \"How are yourrnchildren?\" Cassandra meowed at him. \"Glad to hear that. And how about your oldrnfriend, Phoenix, wasn't it?\" Cassandra twitched her tail and made a littlernthroaty noise. \"Really? Shame. I'll tell her to pay you arnvisit when I next see her.\" The red cat gave a little purr and twitched herrntail again, at which Hector sat up straight and started whipping the groundrnwith his. \"Scully?\" Tomcat's features screwedrnup in dismay. \"Don't ask.\" Hector made a low, rasping sound, close to arnmoan, at which Cassandra hissed and clawed at the air. Cathryn had never seenrnher so furious before. Why, why suddenly? Of course Cathryn knew what hadrnhappened to the young cat, after all she had gone to take her back afterrnWillard had been brought away, but how could Cassandra possibly… how couldrnHector… how could Tomcat … ? \"We believe it was the same rat who killedrnher who also brought our friend Willard down\", Tomcat said slowly.rn\"But we have no proof yet. It's still only rumours.\" Hector mewed questioningly, then turned tornrubbing his head against Cassandra's fur soothingly. \"Yes, it startles me as well\", Tomcatrnadmitted. \"But that's what they say. And I tend to believe them. And ifrnyou wait just a few more hours, we will know.\" Here the corners of hisrnmouth moved slowly apart into a grin. \"We will know\", he repeated. \"Tomcat, what's this all about?\"rnCathryn demanded. Her cat's reactions to him and Hector scared her. Somethingrnwas wrong about this Tomcat, something was very wrong indeed! Tomcat looked up, brown eyes glittering in hisrndirt-tanned face. \"I'm not sure yet\", he replied. \"Willard wouldrnknow. I intend to ask him.\" \"You have something in common, you andrnWillard\", Cathryn stated. After what had happened with the rats, she wasrnready to believe anything he was going to tell her, especially after whatrnstrange scene she had witnessed right now. \"Indeed\", Tomcat confirmed. \"Wernboth have a very unique talent, only the species responding to us is different.rnFor Willard it's the rats, whereas for me, it's cats. Isn't that so,rnHector?\" The grey cat purred. \"You command the cats?\" Cathrynrnasked, not quite sure if this was a reason to like or dislike Tomcat. \"No. You can't command them. Irnsimply talk to them. Sometimes they do my bidding, sometimes they refuse.rnThey're very hard to control. It helps if you ask them politely.\" Hernlaughed, and Cathryn found herself laughing along. Underneath all that grime,rnhis face was friendly and cheerful. \"Cassandra likes you a lot\", Tomcatrnsaid, straightening up. \"You care well for her.\" \"She is very important to me.\" \"I know. She always cheers you up when yournare sad. She's a good cat.\" He scooped Cassandra up and held her in hisrnarms. \"A very good cat. And a pretty one.\" The red cat pawed at his face and produced arnfew little mewing sounds. \"She says you've been sad againrnlately\", Tomcat translated. \"She can feel it.\" \"I have\", Cathryn admitted carefully. Tomcat smiled. \"It's Willard, isn'trnit?\" \"Why do you think so?\" she askedrnsharply. Too sharply, for immediately he gave her thatrnknowing look she found so unpleasant. \"I can guess. Listen, I can bringrnhim here if you want. This very night. He'll then go into hiding together withrnme. And then…\" Tomcat threw back his head proudly. Eyes half closed, arnsmile of anticipation appeared on his features. \"We'll find our place inrnthe world, Willard and I. We'll show them.\" Our place in the world? Poor Willard, Cathrynrnthought, he had seemingly never had a proper place in the world. Was thisrnTomcat really a friend of his? Could he really help him? Aloud, she said: \"You want to go intornhiding with him? Where?\" Again a bright smile. \"Not at your place,rndon't worry. I know somewhere a lot safer.\" \"So why would you need my help then?\" \"It's just that I have to put him awayrnsomewhere to wait while I check the hideout and spread the news around with therncat community\", Tomcat explained. \"If you'd take him in for two orrnthree hours or so… That would about do the trick. They won't start looking forrnhim until the morning anyway.\" Cathryn nodded. \"I could do that. Butrnnobody should find out.\" \"Trust me, they won't. I know myrntricks\", Tomcat assured her. My God, this is crazy, Cathryn thought. What amrnI doing there? Does Willard really deserve my help, after all he's done? Yes, she decided, he did. But two or threernhours, nothing more. \"Anything else?\" \"Well…\" Despite his proud manner,rnTomcat looked a little bit embarrassed now. \"Yeah, Hector pointed it outrnto me. It's just… I don't like it, you see, but he certainly has a point… I'llrnneed a bath, or else they won't let me in.\" Cathryn looked him up and down, having a hardrntime indeed to hold back a giggle. \"You'll need fresh clothes, too.\" \"I already know where to get them.\"rnThe strange young man grinned. \"D'you mind?\" \"It's okay with me\", Cathryn said.rn\"But don't even think of trying anything funny.\" \"Funny? Like what?\" Cathryn shrugged. \"Whatever. Normally, Irndon't invite your kind in.\" Tomcat's grin broadened. \"Yeah, butrnnormally my kind doesn't know Willard, eh?\" \"One more stupid remark\", Cathrynrnthreatened, \"and I'll give you hell, cat-lover or not. There was nothing between me and Willard, nothing , do you hear?\" \"Well\", Tomcat snickered, handingrnCassandra back to her, \"we never know what might have been…\" \"I warned you, Tomcat.\" \"Oh, alright.\" He grimaced. \"SornHector and I will be off for a bit, and then we'll return to hear what you say.rnRight?\" \"Where exactly are you going,rnTomcat?\" He shrugged. \"We'll just nip over tornWillard's house. To recover some useful things. I hope we'll be back in half anrnhour, maybe a bit later.\" He already turned to go, Hector at his heels.rn\"See you later, then.\" \"Bye\", Cathryn answered, holdingrnCassandra to her. \"See you.\" She was far too trusting. Just because thisrnTomcat had a strange way of conversing with cats… And just for a man who had been her colleaguernfor no more than a few days, for a man who had turned out to be a murderer… No, she told herself, it was not fair to callrnhim so. Maybe he had killed Frank Martin with the assistance of his rats. Butrnthe way Martin had treated him, how horrible he had been… It was just an act ofrndespair, she thought. After all, Martin had as good as killed him with firingrnhim. He had ruined his existence, taken everything he had. And Willard had been punished when in the endrnthe rats had turned on him. For these two or three hours Tomcat had spokenrnof, she decided, she would do what she could to help Willard. But after that…rnshe would leave the whole business to Tomcat. It would be none of her concernrnanymore. Hugging her cat tightly, she closed the doorrnand stepped inside again. Had she known what was going to happen duringrnthe next week, she would probably have refused to help. Or maybernnot?[Chapter 2] Whatrndo I do when my love is away? Does it worry you to be alone? How do I feel by the end of the day? Are you sad because you're on your own? No, I get by with a little help from my friends… The Beatles, With A Little Help From My Friends Crouched in a corner, wrapping his armsrnaround his knees and putting down his forehead on top of them, Willard Stilesrnclosed his eyes. He was alone, and there was no way out. They thought he was dangerous. They thought hernwas insane. Clenching his teeth, he listened to an innerrnvoice taunting him. He was far too weak to fight back. There was no way out, no damn way out… But then he sat up straight suddenly asrnsomething small, yet soft and warm touched his ankle. No. He was not alone. He held out his hand, felt how thin whiskersrntickled his fingers, how tiny claws scurried on his skin, how a veryrnlight-weighted, silky-furred something made itself comfortable in his palm.rnRaising his head, he opened his eyes. \"So good to have you around\",rnhe murmured. The white rat looked at him out of clever redrneyes, and sniffed. Willardrnsmiled. \"Any news from the world outside?\" The rat squeaked softly, and, as always, thernanswer arrived straight in his head. Your pack. No leader. Dispersed. Orrndead. No leader. By now, Willard had got used to conversing withrnrats. And he even preferred it to conversing with humans. It was so muchrnsimpler, for a start. You did not have to pick up all the subtleties humansrnmanaged to achieve. Rats spoke in simple, short terms, and they did not lie.rnThey had not mastered the intellect to do so. Sometimes Willard wondered how his own wordsrnarrived in the rats' little heads. When he spoke to them, he tried to keep itrnsimple. But they also understood more complicated things, so it seemed. Maybernthey could not fully read the complex patterns of the human mind. But theyrnseemed to be getting the idea. They were learning. Ben had been a particularly quick learner. Willard shuddered and sought comfort inrnstroking the soft fur of the rat in his hand. Ben was dead now, he had madernvery sure of that, but his memory still haunted Willard's dreams. But it was all over now, Ben's reign as well asrnhis. Dispersed or dead, no leader. No leader. They had not had a leader in the veryrnbeginning. Rats did not need a leader. There was just the pack. And then he, arnhuman, had interfered. He had tamed Socrates, and then he had tamed the pack.rnThey had seen his superiority, his size, his strength, the things he could dornwith his fingers which paws would never achieve, the complex patterns of hisrnmind… and they had obeyed. And Ben had watched. And learned. It had been all his own fault, he had realizedrnit later on. In taking Socrates upstairs with him while leaving the others downrnat the basement, he had created an individual. And this had not felt right tornthe pack. In a pack, there were no individuals. Ben had been the first to tryrnto gain this new status. The others had followed. And they wouldn't leave theirrnnewfound freedom. With their coming upstairs after Ben… the whole pack hadrnbecome a vast individual. And it was always individuals who rebelled,rnnever parts of a whole which had their places in the world. It never wasrnnameless things. It was… … those who had names. Willard could have cried out loud for notrnrealizing his own folly for so long. It was he, he himself, who had made Benrnwhat he had been – by giving him a name. But how should he have seen it? Back in thoserndays, he had not known how the spirit of the pack worked. Giving things namesrnwas just a human trait. How could he have known? It was by giving names that he had started it.rnAfter Socrates had been Socrates, there was no way he was going back to livernwith the pack. Quite naturally, he would return to Willard. Before they hadrnmet, Socrates had just been a common animal, just part of the pack, but Willardrnhad made him special. And so he had done with Ben. He had addressedrnhim, had given him a name, and by this action decided his own fate. From now on, he would not give rats namesrnlightly! However, this revelation came a bit too late.rnSeveral rats now came to his room to keep him company, and they all had a name. The white one in his hands had been the firstrnto come, and he had called it Plato, in memory of Socrates, the first rat andrnbest friend he had ever had. Cold. Hard. Sit other place. Soft place. Willard smiled. Plato really cared for him.rn\"I'm fine\", he said. Soft place , Plato insisted. Lair. Clever rat, Willard thought. He had realizedrnthe purpose of a bed, and he had translated it into the language of the rats.rnTo the other rats, Willard's bed had always been something running along thernline of Big Soft Thing . Plato nibbled Willard's thumb to draw hisrnattention to him. Soft place. \"Oh, alright.\" If this gave Platornsatisfaction, he would do it. After all, it was for his best. He rose to hisrnfeet and stretched a bit, careful not to drop Plato. Part of his muscles achedrnfrom cowering in the corner for so long. Plato moved in his hand. High , the ratrnstated. Again Willard smiled at his little friend.rn\"Yes, to you it's high. But don't worry, I won't let you fall.\" Hernwalked over to the bed – just a few steps, the room was so small – and sat downrnagain heavily. \"I wonder for how long they will keep me here\", hernsaid. Keep? There were things rats just did not understand.rn\"I can't get out\", Willard explained. \"They locked me up inrnhere, and they won't let me out.\" Why? For a rat, it was a very sophisticatedrnquestion. Why should reasons be important to a rat? They saw things as theyrnwere, and they never wondered why they were like that. \"Because they believe I'm dangerous.\" Dangerous. \"Yes.\" You dangerous? \"No, Plato. At least, not to you.\"rnThat should do, Willard thought. Probably this was all that mattered to Plato.rnBut it was interesting how he could pick up things already. How he had workedrnout the meaning of \"to believe\". To a rat, was there any other sense to thernword? Did rats possess any transcendental thoughts? He seriously wondered. There were voices outside the door. At oncernWillard sat bolt upright and listened. \"I'd like to see Willard Stiles\",rnsaid a voice. It had a calm, confident tone to it, something Willard had neverrnreally managed to give his own voice. \"Our Rat Boy? Are you sure?\" If hernremembered it right, this was one of the doctors. \"I'm not sure if it's arngood idea. Alright, I'll call an orderly to go with you. He's been ratherrnphlegmatic lately, but with him… I wouldn't be so sure he's harmless.\" A visitor? Willard had never had one until now.rnThere was nobody who cared about him, except the rats. Who could it be? Thernonly thing he could tell about him was that he was male and very sure of himself.rnThere was nothing else the voice revealed. How should he react? Well, that depended on whornthis visitor was. For the first impression, it was probably best to assume hisrnlethargic pose, sitting with his back against the wall and staring somewhere intornthe air. What about Plato? After a moment's consideration he shoved the ratrninside his jacket and ordered it to keep very still. Plato was clever enough.rnHe would do what he was told. Willard did not have to wait long before therndoor opened. \"Visitor, Rat Boy!\" the cheerful voice of an orderlyrnannounced. It was the same who usually brought him his meals, and Willard didrnnot like him at all. \"He says his name is Tom or something likernthat-\" \"Almost\", somebody else cut him off.rnDespite his usual procedure, Willard just had to turn his head. In therndoorframe, right beside the orderly, stood a young man with long black hairrnwhich touched his shoulders in silky locks, yet had something messy about it.rnAlthough he was not very tall, Willard was tempted to say that he loomed. Thernway the stranger held his chin, his whole attitude hinted a definite trace ofrnarrogance. \"Thank you\", he said coldly. \"You may go.\" \"Visitors are not to be left alone withrndangerous patients\", the orderly protested. The stranger turned to face him. Although hernwas rather thin, his stance was quite alarming. \"He will not harmrnme\", he said. \"Leave us. Now.\" For a moment the orderly just stood gaping,rnthen he turned on his heels and hurried away. With a smile of satisfaction, the stranger pulledrnthe door shut behind him. \"Listen, pal\", he said, addressing Willardrnas if speaking to an old friend, \"I know you're perfectly sane, so don'trnyou play silly buggers with me. I'm one you can't deceive.\" Alright, this changed things a little. Forcing allrnthe calm and confidence he could muster into his voice, but at the same timernknowing that he would never be this stranger's equal there, he asked: \"Whornthe hell are you?\" The skinny young man smirked, exposing arnset of yellowish teeth, the tips of all four eye teeth filed to the sharpnessrnof needles. \"It's time you meet Tomcat, Rat Boy.\" Trying to hide his surprise andrnirritation, Willard said: \"Should I know you?\" \"Nope, but I'm about to fix thatrnproblem.\" \"Why have you come?\" \"Because I need you, Willard.rnBecause I need your help.\" Indeed, Willard thought, I'm thernperfectly sane one among the two of us. Who's that guy, a Rat Boy wannabe? Doesrnhe think I'll teach him how to control rats to kill some person he doesn'trnlike? What a git. \"You're not the only one with specialrntalents\", his visitor continued softly. \"What do you mean?\" Willardrnasked sharply. Yes, he could see it, this was going to run along the lines ofrn\"Please help me train my two cute little black and white pet rats to riprnmy neighbour to pieces\". \"That I have a special gift ofrncommunicating with creatures, only with a different species.\" \"Good for you\", Willard saidrnsarcastically. If people could just let him be… \"Now, now, mate, don't be rude. Irncould get you out of this confounded place, Rat Boy, you know.\" \"You could?\" And you probablyrndon't believe it yourself. \"I could\", said the stranger,rnnot without pride. \"I've got everything arranged. We could do it tonight.rnTogether with my… friends, I have studied this building for some time. It shouldn'trnbe too difficult. Are there any of your little rodents around?\" \"You'll have to explain that\",rnWillard said, ignoring the question. The visitor gave him a mysterious littlernsmile. \"It's easier than you would guess, Rat Boy. I'm just depositing a pairrnof cats in here. As soon as it's dark and most of the staff has gone home,rnthey'll let me in. And I'll let you out.\" Willard raised his eyebrows. \"Don'trnyou think that's a bit too simple, my friend – what was your name again?\" \"People call me Tomcat. But I preferrnto call myself Mishuk.\" \"Mishuk?\" The stranger's dark eyes seemed to gorneven darker. \"After the first cat I met. He was the best friend I everrnhad.\" Like Socrates, Willard thought. Maybe Irnshould give this Tomcat – or Mishuk – a chance. \"And how is this supposedrnto work?\" he wanted to know. \"What do the cats do?\" His visitor grinned. \"Did you knowrnthey do cat therapies in here? That pat-the-cat-and-it's-gonna-be-betterrnnonsense? Well, I just sent two of mine to mingle with the cats they keep here.rnBy tonight, they'll know everything we need to know. And they'll let me in.rnThey learned how to do it. They're really clever. They might even be able torndeactivate the alarm before I come. I've got Chandra on the force, she's anrnabsolute professional. Then we pick up the stuff you need, and then… we justrnwalk out.\" He grinned broadly. \"What d'you say?\" \"And this is really going to work?\" Willardrnasked. \"And look, even if it's going to work, I have nowhere torngo.\" \"That's what you think\", saidrnMishuk, still grinning. \"A young lady by the name of Cathryn isrnanticipating your arrival, mate.\" Immediately Willard sat up straight.rn\"Cathryn?\" \"You've heard right, Rat Boy.\" \"I'm Willard to you.\" \"Right, Will. She's awaitingrnyou.\" \"I'd only be endangering her\",rnWillard said, trying to force the clouds of pink fogging his brain back intornthe recesses from whence they came. Mishuk snickered. \"You're a noblernknight, buddy, really! No, you're not going to endanger her. I made sure ofrnthat. I found us a place to stay. We're just going to pay her a visit. Thoughtrnthat'd cheer you up. And besides, she already helped me, so we can count onrnher. She must be quite eager to see you.\" Cathryn eager to see him! Willard feltrnhis pulse pounding in his veins at this thought. Yes, she had seemed to likernhim, after all she had turned up at his house twice, and she had come to hisrnmother's service. When going to work on that terrible day, he had decided tornask her out, but then Martin had fired him and later on killed Socrates, and allrnthat had been on his mind from then on had been revenge. And in the end… she had turned away fromrnhim. She had refused to help him. But he couldn't blame her. What shouldrnshe have done? Run in, killed all the rats with a flamethrower, run out again,rnknocked the policemen out and then brought him somewhere safe? A bit too muchrnto ask of her. After all, she had hardly known him. \"You coming?\" Mishuk inquired. Willard nodded. There was absolutely nothing hernmight lose. \"Right. But I'll take a few rats along, if you don'trnmind.\" Mishuk grinned. \"I thought so. I'llrnjust tell the cats not to harm them. Well then, pal, see you tonight, then.rnHave a nice day.\" And with this, he was gone. And only then it occurred to Willard thatrnhe hadn't asked what kind of help exactly Mishuk was referring to when he saidrnhe needed it. Well, he was going to find out. Inside his jacket, something stirred.rnThere was a scrabbling of small paws, and then Plato poked his little pink nosernout. What? \"He wants to let me out\",rnWillard answered, absent-mindedly running a finger between the rat's ears. Out , Platornrepeated. \"That's right.\" The intensity of this new thought caughtrnWillard by surprise. Smell. Not right. \"Yeah, he probably smelled ofrncat.\" Not right. \"Look, I understand cats are yourrnenemies…\" Not right ,rnPlato interrupted. Careful. Not right. Willard paused. Now this sounded like arnserious warning, with some urgency in it. But then he shook his head, shakingrnhis doubts away. \"There's no need to be afraid, Plato. I'm not sure about thisrnMishuk fellow myself, but I think that he's a friend, though maybe a strangernone. And concerning cats… they can't harm me.\" Yes, but once you thought that ratsrncouldn't harm you, and you had to learn it the hard way… \"They won't do anything to me\",rnWillard confirmed, but more to reassure himself. Plato squeaked. Go with you. Willard smiled. \"I had hoped yournwould. Thank you, Plato.\" Despite everything. Despite everything. An amazing degree ofrnabstraction for such a small animal. Was Plato fully aware of what he wasrnsaying? Or was it just something he had picked up from Willard once?rn\"Thank you\", Willard said again flatly. Cleopatra. Go with you? \"That's for her to decide. If shernwants it.\" Salazar go? Ruby go? \"Same goes for them.\" Plato climbed down upon the bed and stoodrnup on his hind legs, twitching his whiskers. Call. \"Yeah, that's right, you callrnthem.\" And don't get overexcited, Willard mentally added. Yes, and don't worry about me overmuch,rnthere's a good boy. Don't you try to adopt me, Plato, I'm too big for this! Herngrinned to himself. What a funny old world. A rat starting to act like hisrnmother… His mother. If his mother could see himrnnow… she'd surely give him hell. And she had been good at it, she reallyrnhad. With a heavy sigh, Willard lay back andrnstretched out on his bed. It was of no use to dwell on the past. Now, therernmight actually be a future he could be thinking of… There was the scurrying of tiny claws onrnthe floor, then a little squeak that informed him that a rat wanted to bernhelped up onto the bed. Without even looking, he let his arm slump down to thernfloor. Immediately he felt how a rat climbed up along it, then another one, arnthird one, a fourth, a fifth. They were all assembled. Plato strolled onto his chest and settledrndown there comfortably, accompanied by a small grey rat. This was Cleopatra.rnDespite her common appearance, she was a pretty animal as soon as you got arncloser look, and she moved with an almost irritating kind of natural grace. Thernother three came to sit in a small semi-circle beside his head. \"Alright, folks\", Willard said,rnstaring up at the ceiling, \"we might just get our chance to see the worldrnoutside. The great big world. Bright prospect, isn't it?\" A chorus of squeaks answered. They mightrnnot really have understood him, but they had certainly caught the spirit. Afterrnall, rats were an adventurous folk. And if Mishuk was telling the truth… he wouldrnbe free. Free! He longed so much to see the sky again, to feel the wind in hisrnhair, the gentle rain of spring on his skin, to smell the lilac on the air, torntrot along the walkway with the knowledge he was going home… No. Not home. It was not a safe place.rnSomewhere else. And besides, he was being sentimental.rnLife would not be easy on the run, even if he succeeded. But at least it would be better than this . By now, it must be the middle ofrnafternoon, or maybe late afternoon, he had no idea. How long was it still untilrndarkness came? Sitting around in this small, empty room would be even worse nowrnthan it usually was, because the hours would drag themselves along so veryrnslowly, as always when he awaited something. And then doubt would come and gnawrnat his soul, and when it had gnawed long enough he would at last give in to it… Plato moved, came up to his chin and nudgedrnhim gently. Eat. Hungry. \"I'm sorry\", Willard murmured.rn\"There's nothing left.\" Willard hungry. Still staring up at the ceiling, Willardrnraised his eyebrows. \"How d'you know?\" Willard not eaten. \"I'm just fine , Plato\",rnWillard groaned. \"Don't you try that on me.\" Plato recoiled slightly. Not eaten ,rnhe insisted, but not with the same intensity as before. \"I bloody know ! I didn't wantrnto! Will you now leave it at that?\" The next moment he was sorry for usingrnthat tone on the rat, but it was too late. Plato retreated. \"Sorry\",rnWillard murmured, ashamed of himself. Not slept ,rnanother rat joined in. Cleopatra. She would always back Plato up. Not slept. Whole night. This was Salazar. Yes, he had been pacing the room most of it, andrnSalazar had been perching on his shoulder for part of the time. Ill , Platornstated. Willard ill. They all were worried about him, butrnthere was absolutely no reason! He was fine! Or was he? He felt somehow… dizzy… weak… Tired ,rnPlato said. Sleep. Willard wanted to protest, but he was stillrnashamed about being too harsh with Plato. So he obediently closed his eyes. Itrnmight really do him some good. For one thing, it might come in useful if Mishukrnwas really going to turn up in the middle of the night. Besides, it would makernthe long wait a lot more bearable. Already drifting off, he felt how a small bodyrncurled up on his chest.

Vous vous demandernsurement se que je suis et qui suis-je ? Etnbien vous aller le savoir prochainement. Je n'ai jamais accordénd'importance à la façons dont j'allais mourir ... mais mourir à lanplace de quelqu'un que j'aime me semble le meilleurnmoyen de partire. Mon nom est Jane Rosalyn Pattisson, tous m'appelnRosalyn, j'ai 19 ans et je suis étudiante à l'universiternd'Harvard. Ma ville d'origine est Phoénix aunÉtats-Unis, je suis née il y a 350 ans. Ma mère se nomme Beilla etnmon père Maximyn, ils ont 469 et 506 ans. Bon très bien je vaisnvous le dire se que je suis, je suis un demi-vampirenparcontre mes parents sont complétement vampire. Bien sûr jenpourrais vous raconté comment cela est arrivé mais il serait bienntrop épouventable pour vous de le fairensavoir car je ne peux exprimé c'est images que par contacte. Mesnparents mon promit que si j'allais étudié à Harvard il menlaisserait le choix de mon compagnon de vie qu'il soit humainnou pas, mais je crois que je vais regardé du côté des vampiresnavant de faire un mauvais choix même si dans ma classe de biologienil y a un garçon qui m'interesse au plus aunpoint. Suspence, qui est-ce ? Telnune imagination comme me le répète souvent Dutchess, ma nouvellenmeilleure amie, humaine soit dit en passant, \"sort de ta rêverienma belle et concentre toi sur le présent\". Dutchessnest plus vieille d'un an que moi en âge d'humain, mais celann'explique en rien qu'elle est extrèment gentille et non elle nenconnaît pas mon secrèt, car si cela devait arrivénje serai obligé de la tué ou de la transformée. Le temps desndragons et de dragoniés est révolut mais un jour, cela reviendra etnmoi j'y crois dûr comme fer, car les dragons etntout se qui les entour est une vieille légende de mes ancêtres etnc'est le cas aussi des mages qui nous aide dans tout nos faits etngestes. ― RosalynnPattisson ! me cria mon professeur de biologie pour me ramené auncours. ― OuinM. Benette ? ― Quelnest la différence entre le résultat de l'azote et de l'eau mélangernensemble, et le produit désinfectant tout usage ? ― Ànvrai dire M. je n'ai pas étudié donc votre question est sansnréponse pour moi. ― Etnbien, vous aurez donc plus d'études et de devoirs à me rendrenmademoiselle. Si vous n'y voyez aucun inconvégnant je vais terminénmon cours. Encorenune déscision mal prise, en n'ayant pas étudié les choses qu'ilnfallait, je peux dire adieu à l'an prochain. Mais un danger cenpréparait du côté des vampires, cependantnRosalyn n'était pas au courant. Rosalyn avait bien sûr remarquer lanpremière fois ou elle avait vue le beau garçon au yeux doré, duncours de biologie, qu'il était bienndifférent des autres mais elle n'avait pas remarquer à quel pointnil est magnifique. Le prochain cours était Physique et Rosalyn nensavait pas encore avec quel personne ellenserait assise en classe. Ànsa grande surprise, elle devait s'assoire avec le beau Yannik, trèsngrand et c'est cheveux d'un Blond-Bronze époustoufflant, bien qu'ilnsoit à une tel distance j'essaya de gardénmon souffle ce qui n'arriva pas, car je n'enttandait pas son coeurnbattre quand je m'y approcha pour prendre place à son côté.nJ'étais si belle que mon compagnon de classenaurait dût battre des paupière àfain de ne pas être éblouit parnma beautée et son coeur aurait dût battre à tout rompre au momentsnou je m'y assoyais, mais riennsauf un simple petit sourire en coin tellement jolie. ― Euhn... bonjour. ― Salutn! ― J'aint'en de questions que je voudrais te posé mais ... lui dis-je ― Maisn... ? Tu sais pas comment me les dires. ― Ouinc'est à peu près ça, mais aussi, car je suis gèné. ― Tunn'as pas à l'être je suis ouvert à tout, me dit-il gentiment ― Ok,nje ne saurais commencer par laquelle ? ― Etnbien celle que tu te pose depuis le cours de biologie, non ? ― Commentnle sais-tu que je me pose des questions ? ― Binnpour débuté cela se lit dans ton visage et parce que je peux voirnse que les personnes écoute ou pense, je les vois tous en images. ― Qn... Q ... Quoi ? Moi aussi mais pas comme sà ! Nousnn'avoins même pas eut contience que le cours était déjà commencernet que nous étions les seuls qui jacassaient. Bien sûr après quennous ûmes fini notre petite discussion,nla professeur nous remit un devoir supplémentaire comme conscéquencencependant nous y portâmes nullement attation lorsque toute la classence tourna versnla prof de physique, ce qui retint tous notre attention étaientncentré en avant du cours, une explosion de produit que nous avions,nles élèves préparé pour minimisé lentemps de cours. Mme Chatrielle était de toute évidence une bonnenenseignante mais elle avait déjà oublié que les produits ne devaitnpas resté trop longtemps mélangé, doncnpour les 2 mois qui vons suivre elle sera en rémission à l'hospitalnVelvet, Mme Chatrielle est la meilleure prof mais là je crois que jenvais coulé ce cours là aussi. ― Tunt'en fais trop ma chérie !! elle s'en remettra me dit-il trèsncalmement. ― J'espèrenbien car elle si amicale avec tous ses groupes. ― Quenveux-tu faire pendant l'heure du dîner ? ― Saisnpas trop je vais peut-être allé ... ah et laisse faire je voudraisnjuste savoir qui tu es et ce que tu es ? ― Jenme nomme Yannik Marciano et je suis un vampire végétarien ... ànmon tour maintenant ! ― Trèsnbien vas-y demande moi se que tu veux !! ― Quines-tu et quel espèces es-tu ? ― Monnnom est Jane Rosalyn Pattisson et moi je suis un demi-vampirenvégétarien. ― Ilny a-t-il autre chose que tu voudrais savoir sur moi, en lui demandanpoliment. ― Oui,nde quel famille es-tu ? et que chasse-tu pour te nourrir ? ― Jenvien d'une famille de la haute ( princesse etc) oh et mes cousins,ncousines sont la famille Cullen et je chasse le pumas. Et toi ? ― Jenvien d'une famille de riche et j'adore chassé le Zèbre maisnbeaucoup plus le pumas. ― Ok,nmais là je dois te laisser je vais rentré chez moi, mais avant jencrois que c'est toi qui dois me demandé en mariage car mes parentsnveulent que je sois mariénd'ici 1 ans tout au plus. ― Heumn?? ... Très bien alors disons demain 19 heure 30 chez toi et toutnsera prêt pour la demande juré ! Aprèsncette échange avec le plus beau vampire que j'ai jamais vue, jenrentra chez moi pour faire mes devoirs, pour passé mon prochainnexamen de biologie. Lenlendemain fût si long que je demandais quand le dîner allait enfinncommencer, comme hier j'étais assise avec Yannik aujourd'hui je fitnpareil. Le reste de l'aprèe-midi, passantellement en pleine vitesse qu'au moment ou la cloche sonna je mendépêchis d'allé a ma villa. Bien qu'il soit déjà chez lui àncette heure car il demeure tout proche mais loin pournles humains, pour faire voir aux humains que je peux l'être aussi jendois avoir un moyen de transport, décapotable, ma maison est au finnfond des bois mais pourtant proche denla communauté. Il était déjà 17h30, ― si je veux être prêtenattend pour la grande demande du sciècle je crois que je devrais menpréparé pour lui et me faire selon ses goût commenje ne sais pas les quels il aime je vais deviné pour lui bien qu'ilna l'air de presque tout aimé. 18h45, l'heure approchait mais je nentramblais point, mais parents eux étaient inquiètnsur la personne cependant ils avaient t'en attendut pour voir celanque nul ne leur échaperaient de tout les échange futur de se soir.n19h30, enfin il était là, si élégant etnrafiné à la fois bien sûr c'est ce qui me parut excesif en toutnpoint car moi, je croyais être la seule personne dans cette maisonnqui puisse être belle de coeur ? Et se qui n'était pasnle cas, je ne m'en faisais pas trop puisque tantôt il me demanderaitnen mariage et j'espère qu'il n'a pas changer d'idée en court denroute car là la honte me montra aux oreilles. Deuxnlongue minutes s'écoula avant que je parle et que lui aussi. Ma mèrenet mon père se reagardèrent perplexe comme jamais au paravant ilsnm'avaient vut autant admirative enversnun garçon quel qu'il soit jusqu'as ce jour. J'étais si stressé quenje ne vis même pas qu'il m'avait passé les bras autour de ma taillence qui me plues beaucoup et vuenque mes parents ne nous reluquèrent plus il prit soin de me donnernun baiser tout à fais simple et délicat que je me crus aux anges cenqui n'étais gère le cas depuis que nousnavoins amménagé ici à Calgary. Une ville vraiment sympatique maisnun peu trop ensoleilé se qui nous cloître chez nous. Dans notrendomaine nous n'avons pas besoinnde caché des humains car ils ne viennent pas dans notre immensenmanoire remplie de luxure. La soirée était assé bien amorçer quenmoi et mon nouvelle ami montames dansnma suite personnelle pour discuté des choses qui se sont produite ànl'arrivé et quand nous avons tous parlé des choses de la vie et ennfait de tout et de rien. ― Jensais que nous nous aimons mais ont se connaît que depuis 3 joursnheum non enfaite 2. ― Ouaisnet ce que j'éprouvre pour toi est vraiment le pure amour. ― C'estnse que j'éprouvre aussi mais je ne veux pas faire le mauvais choixndonc je veux un enfant avant que tu me demande devant mes parent, ennmariage, doncnfaisons le maintenant ok ? ― Trèsnbien mais je t'avertis d'avance que je saurai vraiment le plusnpossible doux avec toi ! ― Oknne faisons pas trop de bruit tout de même. Ilns'abandonna un moment à sa caresse, même s'il savait qu'il nousnfallait se lever. Le soleil était un vaste dôme de rubis ànl'ouest, sur l'horizon. Les amoncellements de nuagesnparsemant le ciel d'été étaient striés de violet, de marron, etnles plus hauts étaient mouchetés d'or. Les vitres de cristal de lansuite, qui s'élevaient au milieu de la forêt renvoyaientntoute les couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel. Une chose si bien demander nenpeux être refuser que quand nous ûmes terminé je me sentaisnsoudain plus forte pour affronté mesnparents quand mon amoureux et moi dirons que nous voulons nous marié.nNous entendîmes un toc toc à la porte de la suite, un moment je crunque j'étais faite carncela faisait plus de 1heure30 que nous étions monté. La portens'ouvrit soudain et je vis ma mère qui s'y affalait, elle nousnregardait à la fois soucieuse et si interressé. ― Puis-jenau moins savoir se que vous fabriqué depuis tout ce temps ? Parlanenfin ma mère en nous souriant. ― Nousnnous reposions mais on descend dans quelques instants promis. ― J'espèrenbien car ton père commence à s'impatienté tu sais. ― Quandnà vous garcçon vous devriez vous dépêchez demander ma fille ennmariage sinon nous vous diront non avant même de l'avoir prononcé. ― Ouinje sais c'est pour çà que je suis chez vous madame. ― Trèsnbien alors à bientôt Ilnnous fallait le moins possible perdre des minutes si nous voulionsnque notre rêve ce réalise. Nous nous habillions et filâmes aunsallon d'acceuille pour en faire la demande cependantnj'estima qu'il me fallais parlé en premier. Je pris la parole etnquand j'us fini mon futur mari annonca la bonne nouvelle qui futnimmédiatement approuvé par mon monnpère qui était très heureux de le savoir. Les noces furentnannoncer aux autres familles et à nos amis communs, elles étaientnprévue pour dans une semaine qui à ma grandensurprise passa plus vites que je l'espérais et tout allais de bonntrain. Pendantnque ma belle-soeur me coiffais, ma mère arrangeait ma robe qui avaitnété soigneusement choisie par Mélinda une autre soeur de mon futurnmari, mais la robe était vraimentnjolie et je croyais être trop belle pour l'évènement, car jenl'avait à peine apperçus cependant pas assé. Sophia termina mesncheveux en y ajoutant de petites roses puisnma mère entra dans la suite avec ma robe et je fus estomaquéntellement elle étaot quelque chose, je l'enfila en essayant de nenpas défaire mes cheveux fraîchement fait. Pournfinir le tout mon père mis le voile sur mes beaux cheveux et Sophianfixa quatre autres peties roses à fin de retenir le tout. Ilnne restait, du moins c'est ce que je croyais, pas plus que 15 minutesnanvant le mariage j'en étais toute heureuse et en même tempsnstressée. Je ne pue m'empêchée que de tropnsourire, qui refusa tout autres mouvement brusque de ma part, mesndeux belles-soeur et je savais qu'elle avaient raison en tous points.nLe temps était venue que je deviennenune Marciano, une autre femme et d'être dans une nouvelle famillenaussi. ― ˙Trèsnbien il ne manque plus que la mariée. ― Oui,nelle arrive bientôt ! Manmère et mes belles-soeur s'empressèrent de descendre pour rejoindrenles invités qui attendaient avec patience. Mon père et moi sortîmesnde la suite pour se rendre aux escaliers,n tout en douceur et fierté je descendis les marches aux côté denmon père qui me regardait maintenant comme je voulais. Je fisnattention de ne pas m'enfargée dans mes pasnet nous fûmes tout en bas rapidement. ― Nousnsommes tous réunis en ce jours pour célébré l'union de ces deuxnpersonnes, avant que je commence il y a-t-il quelqu'un qui s'oppose àncette union ? Nonnbon très bien commençeons. ― JanenRosalyn Pattisson acceptez-vous de prendre pour mari Yannik Marciano,nde l'aimé, de l'honnoré, dans la santé ou dans la maladie, dans lanrichesse oundans la pauvreté, dites oui je le veux ? ― Ouinje le veux. ― YanniknMarciano acceptez-vous de prendre pour femme Jane Rosalyn Pattisson,nde l'aimé, de l'honnoré, dans la santé ou dans la maladie, dans lanrichesse oundans la pauvreté, dites oui je le veux ? ― Ouinje le veux. ― Jenvous déclare maintenant mari et femme, vous pouvez embrassé lanmariée ! Manfamille ne comprenait pas trop ce qui s'y pasait dans les villesnenvironantes, car il y avait eue une series de meutres. Tous ce quennous avoins retrouver s'etait des cadavres vidernde sang. Aujourd'hui, nous allions en cours, car les vacances venaitnde finr, nous trouvions que cela faisait un peu bizarre de revenir ànl'Université. Même si nos amis étaient présentnà notre mariage, nous reçûmes encores leurs félicitations et nousnreçûmes aussi des félicitations des professeurs qui nousnconnaissait. Comme nous n'avions pas beaucoup denjours de vacances, nous avions décidé de remettre notre lune denmiel dans nos vacances d'été. Nous avions prévus d'allé visiténRome et Venise et nous voulions aussi allé à Versaillenmais il nous fallait aussi pensé à se nourir de sang animal pournêtre sûr de ne pas succombé au sang humain qui était extrêmementnattirant. ― Serrais-tund'accord pour faire une petite escapade de chasse après les cours ?nme demanda-t-il. ― Ouinmais pas trop longtemps, car nous avons des projets-examens ànpréparé. ― Okncomme vous voudrez mme Maciano. Ilneu un long et merveilleux baiser d'amour, après la cérémonie etntou le tra-la-la, Sophia avait déjà préparé nos deux valise ainsinque nos billets d'avoins et avait même réservé unenmaison pour nous ébergés. Nous partîmes main dans la main sous lesnregards de nos familles et amis présent, pour aller pendant troisnsemaines en lune de miel.[Chapter 2] Chapitren2: L'aurorenet la lune La nuit de noce commencaisnà peine quand mon désir de vouloir être à nouveau dans ses brasnet entre-mêler se fit à une vitesse folle puisque nous étions déjànsur le lit. Mon prince charmant futntrouvé par le simple fait même de la nature sans que je n'est eunavoir à chercher, se qui me parut bien au moment ou mon nouveau marinme fit sortir de ma de transe en menparsemant de tout petits baisée mais à la fois tout aussinséduisant. ― Avant toi,nRosalyn, ma vie étais une nuit sans lune et sans étoiles. Trèsnnoire, même s'il y avait des étoiles- des points de lumière et denraison... Et puis, tout à coup, tunas traversé mon ciel comme une aurore. Soudain, tout brillait, toutnétait beau, tu m'est apparue comme un phénomène extraordinaire qui soudain devintnet donna un sens enfin à ma vie. ― Très beau poèmenpour prouvé ton amour une fois de plus ! ― Oui je sais ... nque veux-tu faire maintenant ? ― Et bien nousnpourions ... heum non laisse faire. ― Tu veux forménune petite famille c'est ça ? ― Oui mais tu nenvoudras jamais donc ... ― Qui te dis quense n'est pas se que je veux le plus ! Il ne disputa pas pournautant mais toute fois une flamèche se fit. Je ne peux pas dire quennos coeurs battait plus fort puisque j'étais la seule à en avoirnun, qui battait plus vite certe mais pas moins,nchaque jours passer auprès lui me rapprochais d'avantage de monnunique but d'être immortelle à cent pourcent. Jamais je n'ai voullunêtre ce que je suis mais poutant je le désirnbeaucouop, accordé quelque chose à quelqu'un que tu aime estnpeut-être le meilleur moyen de dire je t'aime sans avoir à luinmontrée de tout les manière. Je n'avais jamais accordénd'importance à la facon dont cette aventure se terminerait ou sencontinuerait, mais je savais au plus profond de moi même que quoinqu'il arrive je serai toujours JanenRosalyn Pattisson Marciano. Se soir là nous fîmes l'amour pour landeuxième fois et celle-ci devint plus intance quand je senti sesndents s'enfoncé dans mon cou, je croyais au débutnqu'il me voulais du mal mais au faites il voulais juste que je soisncomme lui. Se ne fut pas si infernale que cela pour ma transformationncomplète quoique jamais je n'aurais puencroire que mon amoureux le fasse par lui même, je pensais tout denmême que ceci se ferrais après la lune de miel puisque nous étionsnsur la même longueure d'onde qui de toutnévidence n'était semblable à cet instant. Prince de la nuit, vienpour toujours et le baiser le plus puissant cependant mortel à quinconque ne l'est pas. J'avais lue et relue se passage sur un siteninternet pour une recherche sur les vampire bien quenj'en suis un, mon professeur d'histoire nous avait donner ce sujetnd'étude et se qu'elle ne savait pas bien sur c'était que je pouvaisnrépondre à toute les question qui selon lesnmortels, n'avait aucun sens. Comme nous étions dans les vacancesnd'été, nous avions prévus de les passés en lune de miel puisquennous ne pouvions nous abscentés avantncette période de vacances. ― Nous devrionsnaller nagé dans l'eau chaude ! me dit-il. ― Et bien je nencrois pas pouvoir car j'ai perdue beaucoup de force hier pendant mantransformation. ― Très bien ontnregarde des film alors ? ― ok ... vas pournles films ! lui dis-je avec froideur presque indirecte. Nous commençâmesnpar un film typiquement américain, Le monde infernal 1. Puis le filmnterminer j'avais soudain si faim que j'aurais pue mangé toute lantaillaule * que nous avait apporternMariette la femme qui nettoyait la maison de vacance de l'île ounnous étions. Nous étions cependant pas les seuls sur cette île auxncouleurs exaltantes. J'avais envie de savoir lanchanson préféré de mon prétendant et je crois que lui aussinmourait d'envie d'en découvrir davantage sur sa bien aimé. ― Quel chansonnpréfères-tu me devancea-t-il ? ― Et bien lanchanson que j'aime beaucoup est ´´ Peoplenget ready ´´ . ― À toinmaintenant ! ― La chansonnque je pourrais entendre à longeure de journnée est ´´ Knocknon wood ´´. Il eu un court silence etnnous continuâme de discuté comme sa durent toute la nuit et au levéndu soleil qui soudain aveuglais toute la pièce ainsi que nos yeuxnsensible à ce genre de chose, n'étaientnvraiment pas sur le point de fermé tel une huitre le fairait sousnl'eau aux moindre mouvement rapproché d'un humain. Une chose jenretint se jour la c'est que tu peut toujours compténsur les personnes qui t'aime et qui sont toujours là pour toi. (n.f. Suisse.nSorte de pain au lait)* La villa était bien calmenen cette belle journée,ou l'on entendait les oiseaux sifflotés, nqui commencais a peine, je savais que mon amoureux prépapraitnquelque chose car il fouilla dans sa valise pournensuite me dire de fermée les yeux qui me disait de ne pas lesnfermée. Il s'agenouilla devant moi et prit mes mains pour lesnrapprochés de lui et me tint une boite bien enveloppé, je nensavais pas trop à quoi m'attandre mais cela me paru un lourd.nJ'ouvris les yeux quand celui-ci me le demanda, je voyais dans mesnmains une boîte de trentes centimètres, ànl'intérieur se trouvait quelque chose qui allait me faire plaisir.nEnfin j'ouvris la boîte en détachant les ruban rouge et rose quinmaintanait celle-ci bien fermée. Cela me faisais toujoursnsourir quand mon Yannik regardait dans une direction pendant unncertain temps, je savais dès ce moment alors que celui-ci pensait etnc'est ce que je m'aprètais à décourir. Je l'aimais tellement quenrien ne pouvais changé à ce qui ce passais entre elle et moi, si jenla trouvait morte jamais je m'en remetterais non jamais. Je la retrouve toujoursnauprès de moi ce qui me réchauffe l'esprit quelque peu. Même si jenla vois pendant que je suis seul, prêt à faire toujours ce qui menparais suicidaire pour elle. Bel ange ou je sais quoi,nje te vois de mes yeux qui paressent jeunes mais n'est pas toutncompte fais. Ma fleur doré au soleil dois-je faire des compromisnavec toi si je veux t'avoir pour toujours à mes côté.nOui, non je sais trop quoi pensé mais je sais que je t'aime si fort,npeut-être trop. Ma bien aimée chaque jour dans tes bras sera unenmerveille mais certainement pas une déception. Amournpour toujours, avec toi toi pour toujours. Maintenant je savais anquoi il pense chaque fois qu'il est dans la lune, et bien sûr c'estnà moi mais surtout il ne veux pas me perdre donc je vais y veillénpour ne jamais le décevoir. La belle se fit aucunnsoucit pour son mari qui pensait à elle même quand celui-ci étaitncollé sur son aimée de toujours. Ils avaient loués unnbâteau croisière pour allé visité les gottes de '' Za '', qui euxnsont vraiment spéciale parce qu'ils sont magique, les eaux qui ynsont détendent les muscles et plus encore comme une peaunmagnifique. Les soucits que quelqu\"un pourrait avoirndisparaîterait instentanément. Ma famille était si heureuse densavoir que notre voyage se passait si bien qu'ils décidèrentnde prendre eux aussi des vacances mais avec nous, ce qui pour moinparus une bonne idée et si soudaine. Yannik me ragarda d'un air denreproche quand je dis à ma mère que toutnétait correcte, pour venir passer quelques jours sur l'île. Biennsûr je lui proposa de loué une petite maison comme nous l'avionsnfait, ce qui détendit Yannik quelque peu. Nous nenreçûmes plus de téléphone dce jour là, mais trois jours plusntard nous reçûmes un téléphone à partir d'une des villas denl'île. Bien entendus je fus la première à répondre, c'était nosndeux familles qui étaient arrivées dans leur villa. Ils nousninvitèrent à venir les voir et voir les villas et cette fois ci senfut mon amoureux qui prit le déscision, nous partîmes chaqun versnla villa de notre famille respective puis échangèrent par la suitenet pour enfin revenir tous ensemble dans la maison que nous louiions. ― Yannik, pense-tunme faire de petits enfants ? lui demanda son père. ― Surement carnRosalyn et moi en avons parlé mais nous nous sommes un peu disputé. ― Très bien monngarçon mais déscidez-vous rapidement parce que je suis impatientnd'être grand-père, lui répondit-il à son tour. ― Et toi Rosalyn,nes-tu fière d'être dans notre famille ? ― Oui cela me rendnheureuse lui dis-je en repondant à sa question un peu bizarre. ― Bien dans ce casnnous voudrions que tu sois le damoiselle nonneur au mariage denSophia. ― Et j'acceptensans y réfléchir. Les deux famillesnparut bien satisfaites de se qu'ils venait d'entendre, mais bien quenma mère écoutait elle me fit signe de la rejoindre dans la cuisine. Mais je ne bronchanpoint, car ceci semblait important denla facon dont ma mère m'avait demandé de la suivre. Elle sortiendeux coupe à vin et ouvrit la frigo pour prendre la bouteillenprésente qu'elle voyait et versa le tout. Je lanregardais un peu d'un air piteux mais elle commenca à parlée, ellenme demanda si j'étais réellement heureuse avec Yannik et si nousnavions vraiment prévus d'avoir des enfants enssemble carnelle aussi n'attendait que se moments pour pouvoir gâtée ses petitsnenfants. Nous avons jasées pendant plus de trentes minutes desnenfants à venir et après nous sommes retournées aunsalon avec les autres et pendant ce temps la, j'annonça que jensaurai ravis de pouvoir être la damoiselle d'honneur de ma bellensoeur Sophia. Elle avait tellement fait pour moinlors de mon mariage donc j'aivais décidé avec Yannik d'organiséenle mariage ici sur l'île, Sophia une grande amie de courte date maisnde bonne famille avait tout organisée notrenmariage et notre lune de miel, je me croyais prévilégiées densavoir qu'elle voulais que je sois une damoiselle d'honneur pour sonnmariage que Yannik et moi avions choisi de faire un aussinbeau mariage comme elle avait fait mais cette fois encore plusnféerique qu'elle ne l'avait fait ce qui nous causait aucun problèmensauf peut-être un, les billets d'avions pour tout lesninvités. La mariage aprochait et nous étions presque tous prêtnbien entendus tous sauf moi qui à la derrinière journées avant lenmariage avais fais tout sautées les lumières au-dessus denla piste de danse. Sophia avait fait ma robe de ses doigts mais moinj'avais décidé de faire venir une styliste de rennomée mondiale etnles meilleures coiffeuses et maquilleuse pour lanmariée et pour les damoiselles d'honneur, ce qui ma value beaucoupnd'argent et pour la sécurités de tous j'ai fais venir tout droit denforks Edward, Bella et leur fille Renesmée. Le faitnd'invité de la famille éloigné et surtout d'une autre histoirenrendait l'attrait encore plus forte vue que nous les Pattisson, lanfamille Cullen elle n'était présente à mon mariage maisnla par les temps qui cours la famille la plus forte et la meilleurenpour nous protégé c'était eux mais cela ne me déplaisaisnnullement au contraire sa me plaisait. ― Bon allez toutnle monde en place pour une répition avant le mariage. ― Oui cela nenferait pas de tord de pratiqué dit Edward à l'intension de tous. ― oh toi arrêtenlui répondit Bella. Les préparatifs étaitnpresque terminé quand je me senti un peu bizarre, je quitta monnposte où je faisais les lumières pour aller aux toillettes. La mèrend'Edward ressentis ma détresse et vint à ma rancontre aunmoment où j'allais entrée dans la salle d'eau. Elle commenca parnappellée Carlisle qui m'examina de A à Z et me laissa allé fairenpipi, puis quand je sortie des toillettes, il me regardande facon très bizarre. Tout en parlant avec un cousin proche,nCarlisle, celui-ci m'annonca qu'il se pouvait bien que je deviennenmaman, cependant il n'était pas vraiment certains de lui.nEsmée nous reluquait avec un sourir qui ressemblais fort bien àncelui d'Edward. Ma mère avait prévut, si celui-ci ne s'était pasnmarié avec cette Bella que j'adore tant, d'organiséenun mariage arrangé avec lui, au début la première fois qu'elle menl'avait dit j'avais approuvée sans réflexion car la famille Cullennest l'une des plus importante de tous. Je commenca parnm'assoire puis me calma pour en digérée la nouvelle, le docteurnCullen me conseilla de ne pas en parlé à Yannik pour le moment tandnque les symptomes de grossesses ne seront pasnvisible. Je savais qu'il senpréparais quelque chose en dedans de moi mais être maman à l'âgende 19 ans, c'étais très bizarre de se sentir aussi prévilégiée.nJe pris quelques respirations et me ressaisis pour ensuittenrejoindre les autres. On me demanda si tout allais bien et je leurnrépondis que oui, après tout je n'étais pas malade j'étais justenenceinte. Quatre jours passèrent sans manifestationnhormmonales, mais parfois je pouvais sentir le bébé bougé mais ànpeine j'étais si surprise d'apprendre que j'étais enceinte que jenne pue à ce moment la exprimée ma joie ce qui aujourd'huinje fais en toute discretion. Le cinquième jour, fut le mariage de manbelle-soeur, Sophia, ils échangèrent leurs voeux de fidélité etns'embrassèrent en total, se fut un très beaunmariage réussi. Après la cérémonie, j'avais décidée denretournée dans notre maison car je voulais reprendre des forces ennme reposant des festivités. Peu de temps après je senti unenchaleur sur mon visage, c'était mon mari qui rentrait car la fêtenétait fini. Je fini par me levée et commencée à parlée avecnYannik, tout dabord je voulais lui annoncée ma grossessenmais je décida de lui dire plus tard, mais ont aurait dit qu'il lensavais déjà. Nous décidâmes denprolongé nos vacances car elles étaient merveilleuses, nous devionsnpartir après trois semaines mais après toutes ces belles choses quennous avons faites, nous restâmes sept jours denplus. La grosseur de mon ventre n'avait pas encore augmenté mais jensentais toujours un petit étirement et poids de plus sur moi. Mandécision étais prise j'allais lui dire troisnavant notre départ que nous allions être parents pour toujours.nPendant ce temps, je continuais mes activitées, mais surtout lesnchoses que je fais à l'habituelle routine depuis troisnsemaines dans ce temps qui ne semble pas mourir. ― Mon amour,npourrais-tu venir déchausser ta douce femmes ? ― Oh oui ! Avecnplaisir tout ce que tu désir. Je suis enfin à mon aisendans ce que je considaire depuis un bon moment ma maison. Mon chérinétait parti passer la journée avec ses parents et moi avec lesnmiens vue qu'ils étaient sur l'île. Riennne me faisait plus plaîsir que de voir mes parents mais apres un bonnmoment tu vien que les personnes qui t'entour ne suffise plus quandnla solitude est souvent à tes côter doncnje décida de dire aurevoir à mes parents et je partie vers la villande vacances des parents à mon mari. ― Mon amourn! me dit Yannik quand celui-ci me vit arriver ― Bien le bonjournà tous, je suis si désolé de ne pas être rester plus longtempsnque ça au mariage mais je ne me sentais pas trop bien alors j'ai crusnbon de me détendre seule. ― Ne tent fais pasnnous avons conprit tout cela quand nous t'avons vue partir à lancourse vers votre maison. Le moment n'étaitnpeut-être pas le meilleur mais je vint m'assoire au côter de Yanniknet il me prit dans ces bras ce qui me donna du réconfort pour je nensais quel raison. Je le sentais en dedans denmoi même que les choses ne se serait peut-être pas passer comme cansi je n'avais pas rencontré Yannik le beau garçon qui faisaitnsemblant de ne pas me faire lesnyeux doux pendant les cous que nous étions ensemble.[Chapter 3] Chapitre 3: Nouvelle vie Comme j'étais maintenant Mme Marciano ma nouvelle vie commençais, j'avais désormais plus de temps pour moi et pour les autres personnes qui m'entourais. Ma mère me qualifiait de jeune mariée attentionnée, mais surtout de désireuse. Elle voulait trop mon bien pour me dire à quel point je lui manquais, je croyais avoir pour mon bien fais tout ce que je pouvais pour ne pas mettre mes parents de côté ce qui n'étais pas aussi facile que cela paraissait avec tout ce que je pouvais bien croire sur ce que je voyais la vie de mariée m'avais changé au point où je ne me reconnaissais à peine, moi qui avant cette année, étais dans son coin et ne parlais à personnes, maintenant je suis marié et je vais formée une famille avec mon beau chevalier sur son cheval blanc. (Beau chevalier sur son cheval blanc n'est que pour dire à quel point je suis sur un gros nuage qui ne s'effacera que seulement si je le désire.) Je crois que je qualifierais ma vie d'avant comme \"dernière nuit\" mais aujourd'hui je la dirais \"nouvelle chance\". ― Hey ma chérie ! vien j'ai trouvé un vol pour la Russie. ― Pour vrai ? Ont part quand alors ? ― Cela dépend de toi quand nous partons. ― Dans une semaine dans ce cas. ― Pourquoi dans une semaine ? ― Car je sui enceinte et je vais avoir une grosse rapide – tu te rappel ? - car d'ici 3 jours tout au plus nous allons être parents donc mes parents s'occuperons de notre enfant. ― Quoi ? Si vite que sa ... et bien nous sommes rapide dans la conception ! ― À vrai dire notre enfant grandira à une folle vitesse que si nous partons mercredi et que nous revenons que le vendredi deux semaine plus tard il/ elle aura alors 17 ans et bien figée dans cette âge. ― Ok vas pour cette date d'abord. ― Il nous faudra aussi nos passeports pour l'avion ! lui répondis-je aussitôt ― Oui je m'en occupe dans très peu de temps, mais avant je vais aller faire un saut chez moi pour annoncé la nouvelle à mes parents et si tu veux nous pourrions aller chez toi aussi ? ― Ok pourquoi pas ! Sur ce nous partîmes tous les deux vers les secondes maisons, cela nous prîmes moins de temps que nous pensions, en chemin nous parlions même des noms que nous allions donner si c'étais une fille et si c'était un garçon. Ils allaient donnée Vanessa si c'était une petite fille et Jonathan si c'était un petit garçon. Rosalyn ne le savait pas encore, mais cela ne devait plus tarder. Elle était si soucieuse que les mots qui sortie de sa bouche sonnait un faux aux oreilles de son mari qui la pria de lui raconter tout ce qu'elle pouvait bien avoir de si bizarre aujourd'hui, sans aucun doute elle lui dit que cela fait déjà un bout qu'elle le savait qu'elle était enceinte, mais par peur elle ne lui avait point dit, de peur d'être laisser dans un vide qui jamais ne s'élumine au magnifique soleil qui aurait put ce jour lui percée le cœur de la damoiselle au jolie sourire divin emplis de joie et de tristesse telle une vieille page d'un bouquin prêt à se défaire de sa sublime reliure ancienne. Les mots venait tout simplement dans la bouche de Rosalyn, elle voulais à la fois être sur d'elle, mais aussi être sur que tout ce qu'elle avait en ce moment pouvait demeuré ainsi pour toujours, ce qui avait de plus bizarre dans ce qu'elle appréhendait était de la peur d'être une pauvre femme sans âme dans une solitude incompréhensive et qui ne cherche pas en s'en éloigné de façon rythmé où les gens passe leur temps dans les boudoirs à prendre le thé en compagnie de leurs invités qui rêve d'une vie semblable à leurs hôtes. La solitude qui emplit les yeux de la jeune femme mit Yannik en alerte au point qui lui avoua que rien ne pouvait jamais les séparer peu importe les obstacles que les enfants offrent parfois à leurs parents qui est s'en doute une meilleure opportunité de se faire valoir aux yeux de la population bien différente de la leur. Je viens de vivre de ce que je crois être les meilleures heures de toute ma vie, une famille voilà qui était prometteur, mais toute fois risquer. Mes sentiments pouvant altérer mes pensées, je préférai me ressaisir afin d'avoir l'air bien. Ne s'étant point rendue compte du temps qui s'était passé depuis que j'avais annoncé la nouvelle à ma famille et Yannik à la sienne, que quand je remarquai l'heure sur l'horloge, j'en fus surprise et je quittai mes parents pour aller chercher mon mari afin de retourner dans notre maison. Nous regagnâmes la maison un quart d'heure après mon arrivée à la maison familiale de Yannik, il faisait déjà nuit ce qui nous laissa le temps de préparé un sac pour mon accouchement, j'avais beau me sentir normal mais en faite bientôt alors que tout le sac était prêt il fallu se rendre chez mes parents et appeler mes beaux-parents. Bien que la douleur fût la seconde chose qui me préoccupa, depuis plusieurs heures déjà que je souffrais car le bébé poussait sur tout mon corps, de plus personne dans la famille était médecin. ― J' ai fais mon plus vite, Alice a vue ce qui était pour ce passé et j'ai donc décidé de venir donné un coup de main, avait dit Carlisle qui n'était venu que pour le mariage de Sophia. ― Carlisle mon dieu, tu as fais tout le voyage à pied ? S'était dépêché de répondre mon mari. Bien que je ne puisse pas mourir, la vie de ce petit être compte plus que moi, de nouveaux cris transpercèrent la pièce et toute la maison. J'avais le sentiment que tout était sur le point d'être un malheur, mais Carlisle était la et il m'aida beaucoup, le premier à savoir mon état et le premier aussi a s'occuper de l'enfant. Plusieurs semaines s'était passé déjà depuis que je savais que j'allais être mère mais la le moment était venue que je le sois, du moins pour toujours. Une nouvelle peur que je ne connaissais pas s'installa en moi comme si tout ce que j'étais entrain de vivre n'avais plus le moindre sens aux évènements qui succède le présent et l'avenir. Enfin Carlisle si je puis dire ainsi est reparti comme de la façon dont il était arrivé, sans nous dire le moindre détail sur l'enfant, il avait l'air apeuré par le visage de l'enfant. Mais pourquoi avait-il réagit ainsi devant mon enfant, était-ce si affreux qu'il voulait s'en échapper, peur de quoi enfin ! Mon bonheur qui soudain voguait au tréfonds de toutes les âmes perdues du monde incluant la mienne ne pouvant que sentir la joie que procure la naissance d'un être parfait. Je pus qu'espérer être une mère digne de la famille que je viens de faire avec tant d'amour et de conviction. Le regard sauvageresque que je ne peux voir sur les visages qui m'entouraient dans la pièce fut insupportable. Moins que le temps qui se présentait dans les jours à venir, bien que ma vie fût définitivement changée à jamais je ne sus que faire du moment où je perçus enfin le visage resplendissant de ma fille. Un être complet qui me ressemblait en tout point sauf pour les yeux et la bouche, elle les tenait de son père. Le sentiment d'appartenance est bien plus important dès lors où tout les choses de la vie bascule. Nous aurions voulus lui donner le nom de Vanessa, mais elle ne ce qualifiait pas de ce nom. Rosalyn regarda Yannik tendrement et sue que le meilleur nom serait Dylanne, un nom délicat et sensuel. Lyllianne sourie au regard de la charmante Dylanne qui souriait jusqu'à voir de minuscules petite dents poussées à la troisième vitesse, ses yeux à la fois mauve et bleu offrit plusieurs cris de joie. Rien n'était semblable ou comparable à cette enfant. ― Dès demain j' appellerai Carlisle afin de savoir ce qui l'a pousser à repartir si vite ! Avais-je dis à l'intention de tous. La nuit céda ses reflet lumineux de lune aux rayons du soleil qui commençait à percé l'horizon. Trois plus tard comme nous l'avions prévus, nous laissâmes notre fille à mes parents et prit la route vers l'aéroport la plus proche. Rosalyn senti un pincement en de dans d'elle, comme si elle laissait quelque chose ou quelqu'un qu'elle ne peut s'empêchée d'aimé. Je crois que jamais je ne pourrai laisser ma fille si longtemps et si loin de moi.[Chapter 4] Chapitre 4: Le danger À des lieux de Calgary, des choses plutôt spéciales et pas très net commençait à naître, un groupe d'ancien* occupaient une bonne partie de l'Amérique du sud. Des vampires nées il y a déjà plusieurs siècles, sentent le besoin de dominés le monde de la nuit, ne sachant que faire ils optèrent pour faire des plans un peu spéciales en réunissant le plus de vampires possible. Dans l'état de Washington au compté de Forks, Alice avait une vision flou des évènements qui se tramaient pour les prochains mois è venir. Elle avait vue que la ville de sa cousine Rosalyn serait attaqué la première pour la simple raison que tout les vampires formant une famille unit conne les Pattisson, Marciano et celle de Rosalyn et Yannik, sont doté de dont redoutable et bien particulier. En somme les trois familles est la première en Amérique qui soit que spéciale puis vient ensuite les Cullen et la famille royale de Russie. La famille royale formée de deux frères d'adoption, règne sur la Russie et n'applique que deux seules règles, la première consiste à s'assuré que aucun vampires ne révèlent leurs secrets aux humains et la seconde sert à protégé le monde humains contres les criminels qui transgressent la première règle. Ses membres sont Sirius Altew et sa femme Isys et Jared Wordel et sa femme Guarrea. Lyllianne assise dans le salon, regarde les quelques lignes du journal de la semaine. Les meurtres ne cessait de faire des ravages dans Philadelphie, une ville qui à t'en d'atout. Lyllianne avait visitée plusieurs villes, mais il y très peu de personne qui savait ce qu'elle avait vécue avant de rencontrée Maximyn. Personne s'avait vraiment qui elle était, ils la reconnaissaient parce qu'elle faisait partie des plus riche de New York. Dès ces 100 ans, elle décida d'écrire son propre journal qui pourrait un jour être en possession de ses futurs enfants. Avait-elle simplement un plan à cette vie de fou ? Lyllianne encore dans ses pensées, ne vit pas arrivée son mari, elle fit le saut comme jamais auparavant. ― Oh je te dérange peut-être ? ― Mais non je réfléchissais à tous ces morts retrouvé vidé de leurs sang à Philadelphie. ― Ce ne sont pas des vampires, à quoi bon se préoccuper d'eux, laisse donc faire la police. ― Je n'ai pas l'intention de me mêler de ces choses.

Ok maybe another strategy was needed. \"Hey man, you know I love you~\" Carter gestured wildly between himself and the other. \"She meant nothing, we were just talking about our career choices, that's all. Look~ we have 2 more semesters left before we enter the police force. She understands that\" he prattled on \"C'mon Sang, put the gun down\" He finally begged. Sang, the bleach blond young man, slowly titled his head, not letting the gun lower from in front of Carter. \"Understand?\" he narrowed his eyes. \"She understands you? Is that what you're saying?\" Carter tensed more, he should had chosen his words carefully but sometimes the truth just comes out \"No, no man\" he shook his head never lowering his hands while he shook them in front of himself. \"Not like that~\" He denied wistfully. \"Like what?\" Sang challenged with a sneer. Carter's eyes twitched, he had a feeling that he was digging his own grave \"We're just friends, future collages. We are just interested in what we want to do with our lives\" He rambled, all the while inching closer to his partner. \"Just friends, uh?\" Sand taunted. He did not believe that his lover was telling the truth, the many times Carter played around in the past… Sang jerked the gun but did nothing else. Carter halted his movement and stared at the other man, switching between the gun to the other before settling for Sang. He needed to focus. \"You're lying\" Sang sneered and spontaneously moved forward to get a closer shot. And just as spontaneous as he was, Sang didn't get the chance as Carter managed to swipe the gun from his hand. \"Ah!\" \"Ha!\" Carter laughed excitedly. \"Lee tough me this\" He bragged. Sang glared, getting more irritated at the losing situation. \"Lee too?\" he growled. Carter twitched back, \"Lee?! Oh, hell no! Nonononono!\" He shook his head, heavily denying the accusation while putting the gun into his back-belt loop. \"I mean…we're friends. Friend-enimes? Nah, definitely friends\" He continued to ramble all the while stepping closer and wrapping an arm around Sang's waist. \"But don't worry baby~ it's all in your head~\" Sang growled \"It's not in my head, I see what you do\" he bit back although allowing the arm to encircle his body while pulling his body flushed against Carters. \"And like I said, it's all in your head. All these stories, ideas, theories~ All in your head\" Carter tapped a finger to the others temple. All the while being cautious what his boyfriend would do next, his boyfriend could easily turn this situation around if he wasn't careful. \"Don't touch me\" Sang grumbled through his teeth. Carter smiled as settled against his boyfriend \"Ok ok\" He chuckled as he rocked their bodies side to side while he placed a kiss to Sang's lips. It started out light only for Sang to take over the kiss. Kissing his boyfriend was always seemed pleasant after a fight. Pulling away from Carter, Sand fisted his hand on Carter's shirt. \"Don't ever cheat on me. Don't ever let me catch you cheating on me\" he threatened, his hand gliding down in between Carter's legs and gave unforgiving squeeze to boyfriend's member. Giving a satisfied smirked after Carter tried lurching away. \"Ok okokok\" Carter pleaded in scattered breath. Sang scrutinized his boyfriend squirm, feeling a bit more satisfied that his boyfriend will be able to comprehend his threat. Sang could easily turned to the life of crime if he felt like it.

He was burning and he wanted his boyfriend to settle the flame as soon as possible. Carter gave a flinching grin at his boyfriend's lustful crazed gaze who was looking too pleased with the situation. \"Uhh, y-yea, yea let's go ~\" He rocked their body to start walking. Even with the promise of a good lay, he needed to watch his boyfriend and hopefully be able to keep his precious privates.

Here's a new oneshot I cooked up one day. This time, it's set after the 1998 film Rush Hour, and it's about Soo Yung's thoughts on her abduction, Sang, the antagonist who attempted to kidnap her while she was on her way to her first day of school and what he could've done to her – which she doesn't want to think about. (By the way, the actress Julia Hsu, who portrayed Soo Yung in the first Rush Hour film, did an awesome job bringing her to life.) Also, as a matter of fact, Soo Yung sometimes reminds me of Jade Chan, who is one of my favorite characters from the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures . Both Jade and Soo Yung have a lot in common because they are the same age - eleven years - when they first appear, and they have an extraordinary talent for martial arts. (This is my first Rush Hour fic, so go easy on me, please. Thanks.) Disclaimer: The geniuses at New Line Cinema own the Rush Hour film trilogy. I own the songfics, oneshots, crossovers, stories and poems I cook up from time to time. Soo Yung's Nightmare Soo Yung Han, eleven, closed her eyes and then opened them again as she sat up in her bed, breathing hard. One hand reached up to touch the necklace around her neck – the very same necklace she had gotten, lost and then gotten back again. What a horrible nightmare! she thought. She had been dreaming about the day when she was on her way to her first day of school, and had then gotten abducted. To make matters worse, her kidnapping was orchestrated by none other than Juntao (aka Thomas Griffin) himself. Even now, when she thought about it, she couldn't believe that he had arranged for her to be abducted. Her thoughts then turned to Sang, the leader of her captors. He had shot her driver and her bodyguard, and then proceeded to grab her and take her away from the car as though he perceived her to be weak and fearful, as well as believing, in that sick mind of his, that she was, as she had heard some people call it nowadays, \"asking for it\". When she had arrived back home safely, she had asked her father about that saying. He could tell she really wanted to know the truth. So, after she assured him that he could tell her, he then carefully explained to her that the saying \"asking for it\" meant being raped. Soo Yung then recalled the wide-eyed, frightened look that had crossed her face as her father spoke those words. So that was what that saying actually meant? He – Sang – had actually thought that she was the stereotypical damsel in distress in all those fairy tales she had read the night before her first day of school. Well, she had shown him that she was no distressed damsel, and that she could fight, thanks to Chief Inspector Lee's training her so well. And Lee had given her the necklace too. So nice of him to do so, now that she remembered. But then Soo Yung wondered... what would've happened to her in the van after she had been carried inside it and the door had been shut? Would Sang have, under the cover of darkness in the van, reached for her and then done some horrible, unspeakable things to her, and then hissed snakelike in her ear (in Chinese), \"Don't tell anyone. This is our little secret\"? She shuddered at the thought of Sang's hands all over her, touching her in places she knew children her age shouldn't be touched at all. As her mind began to go into places where, of course, she didn't want to go, Soo Yung then closed her eyes and shook her head, as thought she could wish those thoughts to go away and maybe bug someone else for a change. But they didn't leave her alone. Instead, they kept conjuring up a mental image... a horrible one... Sang smirked as he looked at Soo Yung as she sat there in the van, the bomb strapped to her and tears streaming down her face. The black hair, those eyes so full of innocence, that cute face of hers... Oh, yes, she'd make a cute little puppet – that is, if he had some kind of brainwashing device, which unfortunately for him wasn't even there whenever he needed it – or a little handmaiden to wait on him hand and foot. She turned away when she felt him reach over and stroke her face. She didn't want him to touch her on her face, run his fingers through her hair, or anywhere else on her body. This was, to her, terribly frightening... Soo Yung then shook her head a second time and then lay back down. As her head hit the pillow, she came to a decision. She would tell Lee and his friend Detective James Carter all about her nightmares, and how they were affecting her. The thought made her smile a secret smile – the smile she had heard was the kind one wore when someone was guarding a precious secret – as she drifted off to sleep. ","Summary":" Hey there!

Inside the vehicle are four Asian guys each covered in tattoos and scars. Lee: Oh shit...Triads. Carter: What in the hell are they doin' here? The driver of the vehicle glances over and notices Carter and Lee in the car next to him. He does a double take to make sure his eyes arent deceiving him. He motions excitedly to the others in the car, gesturing wildly like a savanna baboon. All the doors on the vehicle open, and four large men exit and start to circle Carter and Lee's car. Carter: Aw, hell. Carter and Lee jump out of the vehicle, and automatically move to their two closest opponents. Carter: Hey Lee, look, this guy looks like Jet Li if he ate one too many Krispy Kremes! The fat Jet Li lookalike takes a well trained swing at Carter, but he dodges it and counter attacks. He strikes him hard in the chest causing the fat Jet Li to stumble a few steps back. Lee fends off a series of ferocious strikes from his attackers, moving gracefully. He grabs the wrist of the smaller one, twists it, and throws the guy over him. Lee then advances to his next target. The attacker reaches for the gun in his shoulder holster, but Lee is too fast and stops the man. Lee puts the man in a choke hold until he passes out. Carter is struggling with his last Triad. Suddenly, Michael Jackson's Beat It comes on the radio inside of Carter's car. Carter: Oh hell yeah, cha'mon, I'm gonna introduce you to MICHAEL JACKSON Carter does his infamous dance that he did in Rush Hour 2, but instead of just doing a normal kick, he kicks the guy in the balls. He slumps over, grabbing his sides. Carter: THIS ONES FOR MICHAEL! Carter slams his elbow down on the Triad's neck and he falls down, alive, but unconcious.

The 'Creeper' was an old and tatty ship. It had survived many strong and spectacular storms, horrific and horrible hurricanes, terrible and treacherous tornadoes. But, this storm was the most dangerous, perilous, and treacherous storm the 'creeper' had ever travelled on. \"The seas have never been liked this before, me thinks something has gone wrong, or the god of the seas, Poseidon has punished us because of the sins and crimes we have all been committing-\" the old man who was full of wisdom was stopped before he could say another word. \"If you don't stop your little chitchat then I'm going to have to slit your throat. Believe me, I will.\" The rough and menacing sailor spoke as if he was going to viciously attack the old man. As he spoke a chill went down the old man's and whoever was listening spine. All the passengers and the crew of the 'creeper' were sitting and standing in the sitting/eating area. It was a modern eating area. The room had all the latest kitchen appliances. Including a pristine double oven and grill (there were two of these), a brand new microwave, dishwasher (two of those) sink (two of those), etc. The kitchen looked really clean, considering there was only a couple members of staff. Soon after the sailor had spoken everyone could hear a bloodcurdling scream. Everyone looked around. It didn't come from inside the room. Surely it couldn't have come from outside the ship, or anywhere else because everyone is in the room? There was a low chatter between the passengers and the crew. Suddenly a strange looking man entered the room and asked for a man called 'scabs'. Each and every one of the people in the room looked around the room to see who scabs. Was \"What do you want and make it quick.\" demanded the menacing sailor. \"It's her; she's playing up again, sir. She just won't do what I say, sir\" the boy who was speaking was a young lad; he was fair-haired, dark brown eyes, had a small nose and was quite tall. From the way he was speaking he sounded quite scared. He didn't make any eye contact with scabs; the young boy was simply scared of him. Scabs got up and started to mutter curses under his breath. By the way he walked he looked like he was either going to cause some violence or threaten someone.

If I did, I'd have better things to do with my time than write fanfiction about it. AUTHOR'S NOTES: This is an attempt to explore what Lee thought of Carter when they first met. It's not slash. I have also done some editing. The only thing I hate about RUSH HOUR is the rather foul language. RATED: G ARCHIVES: Tell me where. FULL OF BULL America. I am in America. I get off the plane, thanking the pilots and flight attendants. As I do so, a tall black man walks over to me. Fortunately, being a policeman has taught me to control my outward display of emotions. Otherwise, I would probably have laughed out loud. I recognize his manner-it's that of a young man who thinks he's immortal and invincible. I know because I had it once, too. \"Please tell me you speak English.\" The black man says to me. Of course, I can speak English. But I decide to keep silent for now, see how he reacts. His reaction is exactly what I thought it would be. He leans forward and speaks louder and slower. \"I'm...Detective...Carter.\" He says. \"Do you speak-a in English.\" Even if I couldn't speak English, there is no need to yell. I may be Chinese, but I'm not deaf. I decide to lead Carter on for a little bit and see what else he does. He leans forward even more. \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS THAT ARE COMIN' OUTTA MY MOUTH?\" I give him an innocent smile. It's the closest I can come to laughing without really doing so. Carter turns away. \"I cannot believe this!\" He yells. \"First I get a crap assignment, then I get Mr. Rice-a-Roni...and he don't even speak American.\" *Nobody speaks American.* I think. *I do, however, speak English.* I don't let on, however. I want to see what else the Carter does. \"Come on, man, the ride's over here.\" Carter waves me over to his shiny black Corvette. \"Put your bag in the back.\" *Back? What back?* I think. This car has no trunk! It's certainly one of the strangest-looking cars I've ever seen. There's no roof, either. I have seen that before. What are they called, convertibles? Carter walks over to me and starts yelling again. \"PUT YO' BAG IN THE BACK!\" I try to hand him my bag, since he seems to know where the back is. \"No-no-no.\" Carter refuses. \"You put your own stuff in the back!\" He flips the front seat forward. So *that's* the trunk. Interesting. \"I'm not a bellhop!\" Carter yells. \"I'm FBI, understand?!\" Yes, of course I understand. I put my stuff in the back. I get into the car. I am sure this will be a very interesting car ride. \"Look, Captain, I don't think this is funny.\" Carter has been on his cell phone for the past ten minutes yelling at his captain. \"You gotta call the FBI and tell them there's a mistake.\" There is a pause, and Carter's face tells me that he doesn't like what he's hearing. \"No, Captain, I'm serious!\" Then he looks at the phone as if it's done something wrong. He snaps it closed and says, \"one man gets a pinky blown of, man, and everybody's trippin'!\" I show him one of Consul Han's business cards. \"Chinese consulate?\" Carter asks. \"That's one place you can't go, man.\" I pull out Soo-Yung's school picture. \"Soo-Yung.\" I say. \"That the little girl?\" Carter asks. \"Huh? Say somethin'!\" I simply sit back. Even if he knew that I speak English, I couldn't say anything. I don't want Soo-Yung to die. It has been a constant burden on my heart since I was told about the kidnapping. \"Well, I gotta show you somethin'.\" Carter takes a right and stops in Chinatown. \"Look familiar?\" He asks. \"Just like home, ain't it?\" It's actually a fairly good reproduction of Hong Kong, although I wouldn't say it's \"just like home.\" \"I ain't never been to China, but I bet it look somethin' like this, don't it?\" Carter asks. He points to the ground. \"See that?\" It is two footprints with JOHN WAYNE written above them. \"John Wayne? You know John Wayne?\" \"John Wayne.\" I say. \"Yeah, The Duke, man! Hang out with The Duke!\" Carter slaps my back. \"I'll be right back. You stay right here, you might see one of your cousins walking around here.\" Carter leaves, and I shake my head. I know his type. I was his type once. And I can see through him like glass. He is not following leads, or trying to solve the case. He's all talk. I look back at the pavement. Who is The Duke? I assume Carter was talking about John Wayne, but never before have I heard him called \"The Duke.\" I'll have to ask him when I reveal that I speak English. I decide to make a run for it. I won't go out of Chinatown, but I'll just give Carter enough of a scare so I can see how he reacts under stress. I see a bus coming by and decide to board it. As I get to the very top of the bus, I see Carter turn around and realize I am not there. He runs through the street, pulling aside every Chinese man he can find-there are quite a few-before spotting me and running after the bus. I sit down and wait for him to come and pretend he has some idea what he's talking about. I feel the coldness of metal against my neck, and I know Carter has pulled a gun on me. I seriously doubt he will shoot, though. But in any case, I raise my hands. The people on the bus all turn around and gasp. \"What you doin' on this bus?\" Carter asks. \"I told you to stay back there with The Duke!\" It's all I can do not to roll my eyes at him. Doing so would probably reveal that I know English. \"It's OK.\" Carter says to all the flabbergasted people on the bus. \"It's all right. I'm FBI.\" Someone takes a picture of him. \"All right, take a picture.\" Carter begins striking laughable poses. As we pass a street sign, I see my way out and jump up to grab it. A lumber truck stops below it, and I jump down. As luck would have it, a motorhome is also stopping. I jump onto its roof and go through the sunroof, apologize to the somewhat befuddled family, and roll into a taxicab's open window. \"Hey, where'd you come from?\" The driver asks me. \"Just drive.\" I tell him breathlessly. Looking behind me, I see Carter riding after us on a motorcycle. Finally he corners us, and I tell the driver to stop. The driver does so, looking at Carter suspiciously. \"Get outta the car!\" Carter yells at me. I do, holding my hands above my head. \"I told you to stay with The Duke!\" Carter yells. \"Hey, what's goin' on?\" The taxi driver asks. \"Look, just stay outta this, old man.\" Carter says. I take advantage of the opportunity to grab Carter's gun and hold it at his head. Of course, I'm not going to shoot him, but I want to see what he'll do. \"Whoa, man!\" Carter says. Before I know what's happening, he's pulled out another gun and pointed it at me. \"Hey!\" The taxi driver has pulled out a gun of his own. \"Hands above your head!\" Carter and I both obey. \"Drop your guns!\" The driver yells, so Carter and I both release our grip on the guns, letting them dangle from our fingers. \"It's OK!\" Carter uses his free hand to show the driver his badge. \"FBI.\" I decide it's finally time to speak. \"I'm a policeman.\" I say. \"I'm just showing him how to take a gun from a suspect.\" From the look on Carter's face, you would have thought I'd just grown another arm. \"Now all of a sudden you speakin' English.\" Carter says. \"A little.\" I tell him. \"A little my butt!\" Carter says indignantly. \"You lied to me!\" \"I never told you I didn't.\" I say, trying to keep calm and not punch this talkative detective square in his nose. \"You assumed I didn't.\" \"*Assume* I kick your little Beijing butt all the way back to China!\" Carter yells. I stop and turn to face him. \"I am not responsible for your assumption.\" \"You full of bull, you understand that?\" Carter says. \"You full of bull!\" I look him straight in the eye. \"Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.\" I say. \"You seem as if you like to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk. It makes it easier to find out how 'full of bull' they are.\" \"What in the world did you just say?\" Carter asks. He walks away, doing what I assume is supposed to be an imitation of me. \"You like to talk, I let people talk.\" He turns around. \"So now I'M the one who's full of bull?\" He asks me. \"We're both full of bull.\" I respond. \"No, YOU full of bull.\" Carter responds, leading me to his car. I follow his lead, shaking my head. I can already tell this partner is going to be different than any partner I've ever had. Working alone doesn't sound like such a bad thing anymore.

She would be listless and tired in the mornings, and often complained of headaches and nausea. Her appetite had also increased a bit, and she seemed to get sick at the smell of eggs cooking. Willard watched in concern as Abbie slowly got dressed for work. She had been hired as an Assistant Teacher at a nearby daycare, and she adored her job and the children. The feeling was mutual, and once Abbie had bought in Plato, much to the delight of the boys and much 'ew...ing' on the part of the girls. Willard worked as a bookkeeper/clerk in the downtown bookstore, and Abbie would come over after her work and they would have a cup of coffee and a scone and discuss their days-always trying to top one another with tales of woe. \"Abbie, maybe you should stay home today. You look pretty bad.\" Abbie sighed, pulling on a dark blue blouse. \"Believe me, I'd love nothing more than to crawl back in that bed and sleep, but I can't. Mrs. Sweeney is swamped enough as it is, and I can't really tell her I'm not coming in just because I'm feeling under the weather.\" Willard snorted. \"Babe, you've been feeling under the weather for two weeks now. Will you at least try to see the doctor today?\" Abbie sighed and turned to him, smiling at the look of worry on his face. She walked over to the bed and sat next to him. \"You really that worried about me?\" He nodded. \"Well, then I guess I'll see if I can get in to see Dr. Silver during my lunch break. Fair enough?\" \"Fair enough. You better get going, you'll be late.\" \"I'll see you at the Tattered Remnant?\" \"Of course. Six o clock sharp. I think we're getting in a lemon berry cheesecake.\" \"Oooohhh…!\" \"My thoughts exactly. Now scoot, my girl.\" Abbie kissed him goodbye and headed out to the garage, where her scooter sat leaning against the wall. It was a dark green, and had a wide, comfortable seat. Her helmet, which dangled from a handlebar, was black, with a clear visor that covered her entire face. Abbie loved her scooter. She had gotten in two days after being hired at Green Wood Day Care, and had automatically fallen in love with how easy it was to drive and handle. But she was smart enough to never take foolish risks. She pulled up into the driveway of Green Wood, and then paused as she felt a wave of nausea. Once it had passed, she parked the scooter and went inside. She was immediately tackled by her two favorite students, a twin brother and sister named Alex and Amelia, always shortened to Amy. For twins, they were complete opposites in personality. Amy had a tomboyish streak but was sometimes quiet and shy, while Alex was loud, boisterous, and energetic-a typical five year old boy. \"Mrs. Stiles, did you bring Plato again?\" Abbie chuckled. \"No, Alex. Plato's at home sleeping. I might bring her back next week. Okay?\" Alex frowned. \"Okay. Did I tell you that Amy and I are going on a real camping trip this weekend?\" \"Are you? That sounds so exciting!\" Amy nodded. \"Yeah, Daddy's going to take us, and we're going up to the lake, and we're going to fish, and pick berries, and sleep in sleeping bags, and look for deer.\" \"Is your Mommy going?\" Alex giggled. \"Mommy's idea of camping is a Holiday Inn. She's going to stay and look after the house.\" \"Well, she's going to miss a very fun camping trip.\" The rest of the day proceeded in its usual fashion of barely controlled chaos, and Abbie felt herself breathe a sigh of relief when her lunch break came. She went to her boss's office, knocking quietly on the door. \"Come in!\" Mrs. Sweeney was a plump, matronly woman of sixty. She looked like any one's grandmother, but she ran the daycare with an efficient hand. She could be tough, but she was never mean. \"Yes, Mrs. Stiles?\" \"Ma'am, would it be alright if I went to the doctor's? I haven't been feeling well these past few weeks and my husband is concerned for me.\" \"Of course. You're a fine employee, I'd hate for you to die of some strange disease. Take an extra hour, just in case you have to wait.\" Abbie grinned in relief. \"Thank you, Ma'am.\" Fortunately, the doctor's office was not too crowded, and Abbie was able to see him rather quickly. Dr. Silver was about fifty years old, a short, balding man with a walrus mustache and twinkling black eyes. He listened very carefully as Abbie relayed her symptoms, nodding and occasionally interjecting with \"I see.\" \"And Willard's worried about me, which I really can't blame him.\" Dr. Silver smiled. \"How long have you two been married?\" \"Two months, why?\" \"And have you been…amorous in those past two months?\" Abbie giggled and nodded. \"Oh yeah. Most amor…\" her eyes suddenly widened in happy shock. \"Are…do you think…could I be…\" Dr. Silver chuckled. \"Pregnant? You certainly have all the symptoms. I could administer a quick pregnancy test to make sure, if you like.\" Abbie nodded, dumfounded, and Dr. Silver smiled. \"I'll go and fetch the nurse and ask her to give you the test. It should only take about ten minutes.\" Ten minutes later, Dr. Silver smiled at her and said two words that made Abbie's mind go blank. \"You're pregnant.\" \"I…am?\" \"About three weeks along, by my best guess. I can't tell you if you're going to have a boy or girl yet, but I do want to ask some questions. Do you smoke or drink?\" \"I've never smoked, and I occasionally have a beer with dinner. I've gotten drunk once and it's not something I wish to repeat.\" \"Was this recently?\" Abbie flushed in embarrassment. \"My 21st birthday. Seven years ago. I got drunk off margaritas. Seven of them.\" Dr. Silver chuckled. \"Well, chalk that up to youth. Any medical problems in your family? Diabetes, heart, etcetera?\" \"No, my parents were both quite healthy. Dad had to get a physical every year from the Army, and Mom was too tough to get sick.\" \"What rank is your Father?\" Abbie frowned. \"He was a Lieutenant. He and my mother were killed in a car crash in South Carolina when I was sixteen.\" \"Were you in the car at the time?\" \"No, I was at home. They had gone out to a party at a friend's house and they were coming home when a drunk driver hit them head on. All three died instantly.\" \"I am sorry. However, I'm also happy to say that it looks like you will not have any complications with this pregnancy. Do you drive?\" \"I own a scooter.\" \"Hmmm, well after the fifth month you'll have to find other means of transport. I'm sure your husband could chauffeur you around.\" Abbie laughed. \"I'm sure he could. Thank you so much, Doctor. You have no idea how thrilled and happy I am.\" She went back to work in a cloud of euphoria, and when the time came to leave she practically ran to her scooter, eager to get to her love and tell him the marvelous news. Willard was stocking shelves and wondering how Abbie was doing when he heard his name being shouted. He turned, and Abbie came marching down the aisle, a radiant grin on her face. She marched up to him and yanked him into a kiss that caused several patrons to whistle and whoop. Willard kissed her back, and the whistles deepened. Abbie finally pulled away, her face glowing. Willard chuckled. \"Not that I don't appreciate the rather passionate greeting, but is there a reason for it?\" \"Well, I went to the doctor, like you asked.\" \"Oh, and?\" \"Well, I'm probably going to have these symptoms for a while, and I'll most likely gain some weight, and retain a bit of water, and I'll likely be a bit moody, but by September I'll be completely over it.\" Willard blinked in confusion. \"Sounds strange. What have you got?\" Abbie giggled. \"Think about it, babe.\" Willard stared at her, slightly confused. \"It's going to take nine months for you to…Are you pregnant?\" Abbie nodded. \"About three weeks along, Dr. Silver says.\" Willard stared at her in shock. \"I'm….going to be a daddy?\" He suddenly whooped in joy and spun Abbie around. \"I'm going to be a Daddy!\" he shouted, and the people nearby clapped. Abbie laughed breathlessly as Willard twirled her around. \"Yes, you are, and I'm going to be a Mommy!\" Willard smiled at her. \"And what a wonderful mommy you will make.\"[Chapter 2] Where the Heart Lives Chapter Two: Questions and Concerns Willard led Abbie over to a nearby table, his mind still reeling at the news he had received only moments before. They sat down, and Willard fiddled with the sleeves of his jacket, unsure of how to proceed. He was going to be a father. The thought simultaneously thrilled and terrified him. 'What if I'm no good? What if I turn out like my father, cold and distant? What if my child doesn't like me? What if something goes wrong?' He was bought out of his thoughts by Abbie's hand on his arm. \"You okay, love?\" Willard sighed. \"I'm terrified, Abbie. What if I turn out like my father? He was so cold and distant towards me. What if I'm like that to our child?\" Abbie smiled softly at him. \"You won't be, I promise. You don't think I'm not scared? I've never done this before, and I'm wondering what sort of mother I'll make. I'm wondering what it will be like having this huge responsibility. But I know that the fact that I am carrying your child makes me happier than I have ever been in my life. We'll make great parents.\" Willard smiled. \"I'm still scared. But I'll be by your side every step of the way, I promise.\" He grinned. \"So what do you think of the name Matthew?\" Abbie giggled. \"Willard, I'm only three weeks pregnant! I don't even know if the babe is a boy or girl. It's a bit early to be thinking of names, love.\" \"It's never too early. Were you named for anyone?\" Abbie nodded. \"My great-great grandmother on my Mom's side was named Annabelle. I don't know if she shortened it like I do. What about you?\" \"My mother told me once that she just thought Willard was an interesting name. Of course, when she was…sick, she decided to rename me Clark. Said it was a stronger name than Willard.\" Abbie laughed. \"Clark? What a boring, common name. Willard is much more unique and interesting.\" Willard beamed. \"I always thought so. How do you like the name Elizabeth?\" Abbie laughed. \"It's a very pretty name, but please, at least wait for a few weeks before you start spouting off names.\" Willard pouted at her. \"Well, do you have any ideas?\" Abbie gave him a look of exasperation. \"Of course I do. I just don't want to commit to any names right at the moment. But I've always liked Rebecca for a girl or Matthew for a boy.\" \"Those are good names.\" Abbie nodded. \"Yeah.\" Willard reached over and gently squeezed her hand, and she stared at him, happy tears pricking the corner of her eyes. \"Willard…we're going to be parents.\" \"I know, I find it amazing too. There's going to be a lot of changes, aren't there?\" Abbie smiled. \"There sure are.\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Stiles?\" Abbie and Willard looked up at the man who had spoken. Mr. Grant Devons was Willard's boss, and as far from Martin as it was possible to get. He was in his late sixties, and his family had owned the bookstore The Tattered Remnant for generations. Mr. Devons had a frizzy mop of white hair, a kind, open face, and brown eyes which missed nothing. When he smiled, he revealed a set of slightly yellowed dentures. He had a bright, exuberant personality and was affectionately referred to as 'Gramps' by the younger members of his staff. He smiled at Abbie and Willard. \"I heard the news. Congratulations to you both.\" Willard smiled shyly, still unused to a boss that wasn't constantly haranguing and insulting him. \"Th…Thank you, Sir.\" Mr. Devons smiled. \"Willard, you don't need to be so gun shy around me.\" \"I…I know, Sir, but my last boss, Frank Martin, he…well, he wasn't a very good boss.\" Willard glanced at the table, slightly nervous. \"He…nothing I ever did was good enough.\" Devons laughed. \"Well, his loss is my gain. You're a fine bookkeeper, and my shelves have never looked neater. I should call your old boss; give him a piece of my mind.\" Willard stared wide eyed at Abbie, and she spoke up. \"Mr. Devons, that's a very generous offer, but unfortunately Mr. Martin died last year in an accident.\" \"Oh, that's too bad. Well, that's life.\" Devons smiled, and then changed the subject. \"Well, in honor of this fine occasion, feel free to order anything off the menu. It's on me tonight.\" Abbie smiled. \"Thank you.\" Devons patted her hand. \"Well, it's the least I can do. What would you like?\" \"Lemon berry cheesecake and a raspberry chocolate mocha.\" Devons grinned. \"What size?\" \"The biggest you've got.\" Devons laughed. \"You got it, Mrs. Stiles.\" \"Please, call me Abbie.\" \"Abbie. Lovely name.\" Abbie blushed. \"Thank you.\" Willard opened the door to the cabin, sighing ruefully as Abbie dashed past him, jabbering away. \"That was the best cheesecake ever and the mochas were so good and raspberryish and chocolaty and the whipped cream was so…whipped creamy and white and when one was gone I got another and it wasn't as raspberryish this time, it was more chocolaty and I think we should start looking for baby clothes and I want booties but I can't knit maybe I should learn to knit and then I could make booties and they'd be cute but not pink because pink is a boring color I was thinking maybe purple or green or….\" \"Abbie.\" \"Or maybe blue because that's the color of the ocean and I love the ocean have you ever been to the beach, Willard? We should go to the beach sometime, it's really fun and I used to love splashing in the waves when I was little and…\" \"Abbie.\" \"Or maybe we could spend a weekend picking out colors for the nursery and buying a crib and a bassinet and a cradle I used to know someone that made beautiful wooden cradles I wonder if he's still around and…\" \"ANNABELLE!\" Abbie pouted at Willard. \"What?\" Willard raised his eyebrow at her. \"Are you done jabbering?\" \"Yeah.\" Willard sighed in relief. \"Good. Babe, from now on, if someone offers you free chocolate raspberry mochas, don't drink eight of them in a row. Especially if you keep getting the largest size available.\" Abbie sat on the couch, frowning at him. \"I'm on a bit of a sugar high.\" Willard chuckled. \"So I noticed. You going to be alright?\" Abbie nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears. Willard sat next to her, pulling her into his arms. \"Hey, what's wrong? If you're crying because I yelled at you, I'm sorry.\" Abbie shook her head. \"I'm not crying about that, but I accept your apology. Willard, I'm…I'm just so scared. What if something happens to us? What if….what if I have a miscarriage? What if something goes wrong and the baby is premature? What if…God, listen to me. What if. What if I suddenly get transported to Timbuktu on a prop plane? No one ever told me how terrifying and exciting the thought of being a mother could be. I….\" she buried her face in his shirt, sobbing. Willard gently lifted her chin, staring softly at her. \"You listen to me, Annabelle Stiles, because I will not repeat myself. You will make a phenomenally fantastic mother. You are gentle, compassionate, caring, tough, and brave. I can't promise that everything will be perfect, but no matter what happens I am going to be at your side every step of the way. So dry your eyes, love.\" Abbie wiped her eyes, and then snuggled up to him. \"How do you always know the right thing to say to me?\" \"It's a gift.\"[Chapter 3] Where the Heart Lives Chapter Three: Shopping \"Oooh, look at the cute little duckies! They're on a blue blankie! Oooh, it's so soft! Willard, we have to get the blue ducky blankie!\" Willard chuckled softly. \"Abbie, we've already got five blankets. One with teddy bears, one with frogs, two with lambs, and one solid green one.\" Abbie pouted at him. \"I know, but…duckies!\" She shook the blanket at him, and he shook his head in amusement. \"Put it in the cart.\" Abbie squealed in delight and dropped it in the cart. \"Do you have enough blankets now?\" \"I suppose. Now we get to go pick out cute little onesies!\" Willard smiled at his wife's enthusiasm. They had driven into the city to go baby-shopping, and Abbie was in heaven. Her initial fear had been replaced by eagerness and a strange desire to buy everything in the baby store. Willard had to gently remind her that they were not millionaires, and that their baby probably didn't need a lot of fancy accessories just yet. Abbie had pouted, but agreed to curtail her shopping frenzy. \"Willard, look at this cute outfit! It's got a doggy on it! Oooh, look at this pretty green dress!\" \"Abbie, why don't you wait until next week before you start buying dresses? Dr. Silver said that was when you'd find out the sex of our baby. I'd hate for you to stock up on dresses only to find out you're having a boy. The poor child would have quite the strange upbringing.\" Abbie sighed. \"I know, but the dress is so pretty!\" Willard gave her a look, and she frowned. \"Very well. No pretty green dress today. I'm going to go find the stuffed animals. Give me the cart.\" Willard surrendered the cart, and Abbie set off. She returned a few moments later, and Willard didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The cart was piled full of stuffed animals-dogs, cats, tigers, horses, and…Willard chuckled…even a giant penguin. He walked over to her, standing in front of the cart. \"Abbie? Remember what we talked about earlier? You can't buy the store's entire supply of stuffed animals. Pick out three.\" Abbie huffed. \"But Willard…\" \"No buts, Abbie. Three stuffed animals.\" Abbie hemmed and hawed, then finally sighed in exasperation. \"Very well. Can I pick out one big one and two little ones, or three little ones, or three big ones, or two big ones and one little one; do they all have to be the same kind?\" Willard buried his face in his hands. \"Abbie, I don't care. Just pick out three stuffed animals.\" Abbie huffed. \"Okay, the panda bear, the doggie, and the penguin.\" Willard glared at her. \"Be more specific. You've got three panda bears and six dogs in that cart.\" \"The medium sized panda, the German Shepherd, and the penguin.\" Willard smiled. \"Good choice, babe. Very cute too. Tell you what-I'll go put the rest of the stuffed animals back, and then take you to the Café here to get something to eat. We can finish our shopping expedition after lunch.\" Abbie grinned. \"Sounds like a plan, I'm starving.\" Willard chuckled and kissed her forehead. \"Well, then let's go eat.\" The shopping trip was a monumental success, and Abbie and Willard returned home laden down with packages. Willard kicked the front door shut with his foot, placed the bags he was carrying on the table, and then collapsed on the couch, eyes shut in exhaustion. Plato, who was sleeping on Willard's pillow, heard her humans, and squeaked in delight, running out to greet them. Abbie scooped her up, giving her a kiss between the ears. \"Hello girl. You miss us?\" Plato chittered, and Abbie smiled. \"I'll take that as a yes. Go see Willard.\" Plato ran over to Willard, nuzzling his face. Willard opened his eyes, smiling softly. \"Hey Plato. I'm glad to see you too, girl.\" Plato chittered happily. Abbie grinned, then sat next to Willard and shut her eyes. \"So, I think we did pretty well this trip.\" Willard gawped at her in shock. \"This trip?\" he squeaked out. \"Abbie, you bought enough clothes to last until the babe is three. Not to mention we've got a crib that needs assembling, myriad bath toys, blankets, enough diapers for thirty kids, plus bath toys, towels, blankets, and stuffed animals. What is there left to buy?\" Abbie shook her head sympathetically at him. \"Oh, you poor, naïve, man. There's a lot more things that need to be bought. Not necessarily for the wee one, though. I saw this beautiful sketch pad…\" \"What about the one I gave you for Christmas?\" Abbie smiled. \"That's all full up, love. Want to see what I drew?\" Willard nodded, and Abbie walked into the bedroom, returning with the sketchbook. \"Here.\" Willard flipped through the book, smiling. \"Abbie, these are all pictures of me.\" He stopped at one picture, gulping. \"When…when did you draw this one?\" The drawing depicted him sleeping, a soft, peaceful expression on his face. Abbie kissed him. \"A few nights ago, I woke up and looked over at you, and you just looked so peaceful and happy that I reached for my pad and pencil. I thought about waking you, but realized I liked this picture more.\" Willard kissed her softly, and then smiled. \"I've got something for you.\" He reached in his jacket pocket, pulling out a folded envelope. \"I wrote this the night we found out about the babe. Now, I'm not much of a writer, but…\" He handed her the envelope, and Abbie opened it, unfolding the letter. ' To my Annabelle. My Annabelle, my beauty Queen, My love, my soul, my endless dream. My light, my life, my joy, my hope, my one and only, my gorgeous wife. Abbie, you are all those things to me and so much more. You are the reason for me being here and not in the asylum. You were able to bring me out of my shell in a way that nobody had ever been able to do. You reawakened a part of me that I had feared long dead, and I will forever be grateful to you for that. I was so scared when I asked you to marry me-scared that you would laugh in my face, or worse, refuse me outright. I know that those were foolish thoughts, but I couldn't stop them from whispering in my head. But when you said yes, it felt as though my entire world had ceased to be, and instead I was in Heaven, holding the love of my life in my arms. And now you are carrying my child, and the sheer joy and elation I feel at that thought makes me dizzy with wonder. I want nothing more than to see our child grow up. I want to see if he (or she) will have your gorgeous hazel eyes and that adorably crooked smile of yours. I want to watch our babe take those first steps, and I want to see that first radiant smile when he recognizes us as his daddy and mommy. I want to hear his first words, and listen to you sing lullabies to him while you rock him to sleep. But most of all, I want him to realize what a true blessing his Mommy is and how deeply and utterly I love her. I love you, my Annabelle.' Abbie looked over at Willard, tears running down her face. \"Willard, I…\" she threw her arms around him, kissing him soundly, pouring every ounce of her love and devotion into the kiss. \"I love you too, My Willard.\" Author's Note: I hope no one minds the shortness of these chapters. Good News: I'll be getting the Willard DVD Saturday! (Thank you Candy! I dedicate this Chapter to you for your sheer awesomeness!*Hugs*)[Chapter 4] Where the Heart Lives Chapter Four of Doctors and Names Abbie clutched Willard's hand and gazed in slight trepidation at the nurse, a young woman of about twenty. The nurse smiled gently at her. \"Mrs. Stiles, there is nothing to worry about. The ultrasound will be quick and painless, and you'll get to see your child.\" Abbie beamed in joy at that thought. \"Really?\" The nurse nodded, and Abbie grinned. \"Well then, let's get this show on the road!\" The nurse helped her to lie down, and smiled at Willard. \"You just keep holding your wife's hand, Mr. Stiles. I have the feeling you're going to want to see this as well.\" \"I wouldn't miss this for the world.\" The nurse smiled, then ran the wand slowly over Abbie's rounded stomach. \"There's the little one!\" Abbie felt tears running down her face as she saw her tiny baby. \"Is it a boy or girl?\" The nurse looked at the monitor. \"Well, from what I can see here, I'd say girl. And a very healthy girl at that. Heart rate fine appears to be quite comfy, and well fed. Have you been eating well?\" Abbie smiled through her tears. \"I'm having a girl? Willard, we're having a girl.\" Willard gazed in wonder at the monitor. \"I know, Abbie. I hope she has your eyes.\" \"I want her to have your hair. Hazel eyes and black hair. What a beautiful baby she's going to be.\" The nurse smiled. \"She certainly is. Now, as I asked earlier, are you eating healthy? Any cravings?\" Abbie grinned sheepishly. \"Yes to both. I'm eating healthy, but my sweet tooth seems to have increased. I crave Reese's.\" Willard chuckled. \"So that's why you made me buy you seven packages of Reese's the last time I went shopping!\" He looked at the nurse in bemusement. \"And I was given strict orders that I must buy the largest size bags the store carried. My darling sweet loving wife threatened to castrate me if I didn't.\" Abbie huffed in indignation. \"I did not threaten to castrate you. I said I would break your head. There's a difference.\" Willard gave her a mock pout. \"Are all pregnant women as scary as you?\" Abbie stuck her tongue out at him in answer. The nurse laughed. \"Mr. Stiles, it's nothing to be concerned about. Your wife just has a great deal of hormones right now, and as such her emotions are basically churning away. Just be supportive of her when she needs you and leave her alone when she doesn't. We women have carried babies for centuries, and believe it or not, we can manage once in a while without the help of our men.\" Abbie smiled, gently squeezing Willard's hand. \"Well said, but I'm very happy that my man is here to help me manage better. I wouldn't want to do this without him.\" \"No reason why you should, Mrs. Stiles.\" Dr. Silver had come into the room. He turned to the Nurse. \"Jackie, how's everything?\" Nurse Jackie smiled. \"See for yourself, Dr.\" She turned the monitor towards him, and he beamed. \"Very good. Mrs. Stiles, I believe you are going to have a girl. But don't quote me on that. Also, the baby is perfectly healthy. Now, I have a few orders for you both. Mrs. Stiles, you are no longer allowed to ride your scooter after next week.\" Willard smiled. \"That's no problem; I can drive her to work.\" \"Good. Now, be sure you eat a healthy diet. Sweets are alright, but don't overdo it, and no alcohol except for a small glass of wine. I know you don't smoke. Are you on any prescription medication?\" Abbie shook her head. \"I take aspirin for headaches when I get them.\" \"That's fine. Mr. Stiles, you are most likely going to have to endure your wife's mood swings. My order for you is to be a loving and supportive husband. This means knowing when to talk and when to keep your mouth shut. I have two children of my own, and I learned that whenever my wife asked me a question about her physical appearance while she was pregnant my best response was to simply keep quiet. She didn't want an answer anyway, just an outlet for venting. So be prepared for that.\" Willard smiled. \"I'm used to being vented at, trust me. I can handle it.\" Dr. Silver laughed. \"Good. Now, final order for you both. No sex after the sixth month. You don't want to poke the baby.\" Abbie and Willard frowned, and then burst out laughing. Abbie got herself under control first. \"No…we…wouldn't want that!\" Willard gasped for breath. \"Yeah, it would be quite awkward. Dr, how long after she gives birth do we have to wait?\" \"I'd say a few weeks, why?\" Willard gave Abbie a devil smile. \"Good. So, Abbie, in four months and three weeks I am going to make sure we have some very intense sex. Long lasting, intense, passionate, sex.\" Abbie sighed in longing. \"Okay.\" Dr. Silver laughed. \"An appointment worth keeping. Mr and Mrs. Stiles, thank you so much for coming in, and I hope to see you again soon.\" Later that night, Abbie lay in Willard's arms, gently stroking his bare chest. \"Madison.\" Willard opened his eyes and stared at her. \"What?\" \"The name. Madison. What do you think?\" \"I think it sounds like a street name. And, also it's nearly midnight. Are we really going to discuss baby names now?\" \"Well, I can't sleep, so I thought maybe we'd try to think of names.\" Willard turned on his side, smirking at her. \"Baby, if you can't sleep, I know something else we could do.\" He kissed her throat, gently nipping, and Abbie moaned. Willard chuckled softly, then slowly pulled the sheet down, caressing her breast firmly. \"I have to say, one thing I do love about you being pregnant is the fact that those delectable breasts of yours are so much bigger.\" \"They'll probably go back to their regular size after the baby's born.\" Willard smiled, and then slowly flicked his tongue across her right nipple. \"True, but that won't make them any less delectable.\" He ran his tongue over her left nipple, and then slowly drew her breast into his mouth, and Abbie groaned, fisting her hands in his hair. \"Willard…\" \"Abbie, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever known. I love you, my Abbie.\" \"Love you, Willard…love you…\" \"Now, the doctor said no sex after the sixth month, so I'm going to make this last…\" And he did. Abbie sighed happily as Willard gently pulled out of her. \"Mmmm….that was amazing, like always. So, how do you like the name Emily?\" Willard sighed. \"Are we really going to do this?\" Abbie nodded firmly, and he sighed once more. \"Very well. Emily is a pretty name, but it's a bit common. I want our baby to have a unique name. What about Karina?\" \"That's a good name. Karina Stiles. It has a nice ring to it. Course, I like the name Rebecca too.\" \"Well, that can be her middle name. Karina Rebecca Stiles.\" Abbie smiled. \"That's perfect. Course, if we have a boy, then he's going to be quite confused over those names. We should think of boys names, just in case. And I swear, if one of your suggestions is Willard Junior, I'm going to hit you.\" Willard chuckled. \"Duly noted. What about Nathan?\" \"Dear Lord, no.\" \"Okay, not Nathan. How about Thomas?\" \"Not bad. I like the name Crispin.\" Willard gaped at her. \"That's an even stranger name than Willard, babe.\" Abbie chuckled. \"I know, but it is quite unique. Crispin Stiles. Has an interesting ring to it, don't you think?\" Willard frowned. \"Think of another name, love.\" \"Fine. What about Ambrose?\" \"No.\" \"Jonathon?\" \"Maybe. Abbie, it's nearly two a.m., and I'm quite exhausted. Can't we continue this discussion when the sun's up?\" \"Of course. I'm sorry, love, I didn't mean to keep you awake. We'll talk in the morning. Night.\" Abbie kissed him, and then snuggled up to him. \"Willard?\" \"Yes?\" \"I can't wait to see our baby.\" \"Me neither, Abbie. Me neither.\"[Chapter 5] Where the Heart Lives Chapter Five: Karina Abbie sighed, slowly tapping her foot. Mrs. Sweeny had called a meeting of the teachers and their assistants in order to discuss new regulations that had just been passed. To Abbie, the meeting seemed to be lasting forever, and no matter how hard she tried, she simply could not get comfortable. But, she reflected, she was currently in her ninth month of pregnancy. 'Oh my baby, I'm so ready to meet you.' Her pregnancy had been an easy one, and Willard had been well able to handle her mood swings. After one particularly bad one, when she had been sobbing in his arms and hiccupping out her apologies, she asked him why he was putting up with her. \"I'm such a muh…muh…mess, Willard. Why haven't you run away?\" \"Well, for starters, you're my wife, and husbands don't run from their wives. Second, you are not a mess. You're absolutely gorgeous. Pregnancy is definitely a good look for you. Third, I'm pretty used to being yelled at, although the apology part is something new. And finally, I am madly in love with you and I'm not going anywhere. Now, dry your eyes, babe. You're stuck with me.\" Abbie sniffled. \"Promise?\" \"I promise.\" After that, Abbie's mood swings had become less frequent, and she fully embraced her upcoming motherhood. But, she thought with a chuckle, her joy and elation was nothing compared to Willard's. He was in Heaven, and occasionally Abbie would catch him smiling at her in a way that made her feel more loved than she ever had before. She remembered when they had felt their child kick for the first time: Abbie lay in Willard's arms, sighing happily as he massaged her neck. He was quite talented at that, and he had eased her aching back and shoulders many times. She shut her eyes, moaning quietly as his talented fingers worked out the kinks in her neck and shoulders when she suddenly felt her stomach give a jolt. \"Oh!\" Her eyes flew open in surprise and shock, and Willard stared at her, scared and concerned. \"Abbie? Are you alright?\" Abbie blinked, then slowly placed her hand on her stomach, gasping as she once again felt the jolt. \"Willard…she just kicked.\" Willard gaped at her. \"She…the baby?\" Abbie nodded, tears in her eyes, and Willard gasped in wonder before gently placing his hand on her stomach. The babe kicked once more, and Willard beamed. \"Wow. This is…amazing.\" He caressed Abbie's stomach, speaking softly. \"Hello, little one. I know we won't meet for another three months, but I'm your Daddy, and the beautiful woman who's carrying you is your mommy. We both are so excited at the thought of meeting you, and I want you to know that we already love you bunches and bunches.\" Abbie smiled at him. \"Bunches and Bunches?\" \" My mom used to say that when I was a baby. I love you bunches and bunches.\" He smiled sadly. \"She was a good mother to me. It was only after Father died that she begin to…change, and after she got sick, everything changed. But, I still loved her. I think she would have liked you.\" \" I'm sure she would, and I'd like her. Now, as for my parents, they would love you. My father could be quite formidable, but anyone that treated his Little Treasure the way you do would definitely be on his good side. My mother liked everyone.\" Willard chuckled. \"Little Treasure?\" Abbie blushed crimson. \"That was his name for me. I was Daddy's Little Treasure.\" Willard smiled, and then gently kissed her. \"And what a priceless treasure you are.\" Abbie sighed, trying her best to not fall asleep as Mrs. Sweeney continued to read the new regulations. There seemed to be hundreds of them, and Abbie felt herself drifting, but still tried her level best to look alert and attentive. All thought was driven out of her when she felt her stomach give a sharp, painful jolt. She gasped in harsh surprise, and then whimpered as a second, stronger jolt hit her. \"Mrs. Sweeney?\" \"Yes, Mrs. Stiles?\" \"I think…I think I'm about to go into labor.\" She yelped as another contraction hit, and she began sobbing. \"I want Willard!\" Mrs. Danvers, the Three Year Old Teacher, gently patted her arm. \"Calm down, sweetheart. Mrs. Sweeney just left to call Dr. Silver, and I'll drive you to his office.\" \"Want Willard.\" \"I'll give him a call when we get to the Doctor's, okay?\" \"Okay.\" Abbie yelped as another, stronger contraction hit. \"DAMNIT THAT HURT!\" Mrs. Danvers smiled in sympathy. \"It's alright, Abbie. You're going to be fine.\" Willard was stocking books when his phone went off. He sighed, fumbling for it, and managed to press it between his chin and shoulder. \"Willard Stiles speaking.\" \" Mr. Stiles? This is Beth Danvers. I work with your wife.\" Willard stood up straight, worry coating his voice. \"Is she okay? Has something happened to the baby?\" \" She's fine, but she went into labor about an hour ago. Now, I took her to the hospital, and I called Dr. Silver at his office, and I wanted to call you and tell you that she's doing just fine. But she's rather insistent that you be here. We're at Our Lady of Mercy.\" \"I'll be there in ten minutes.\" He ended the call, and then ran to find Mr. Devons. Abbie groaned in agony as another contraction hit. 'Why didn't anyone tell me how much this HURTS? !\" She gripped the side of the bed and bit her lip to keep from crying in pain. \"WILLARD!\" \"I'm here, baby.\" Abbie turned her head, and beamed at him. \"Bout damn time you showed up.\" Willard came forward and kissed her. \"Sorry, traffic was a bit bad. Did I miss anything?\" Abbie shook her head and was about to answer when she felt her water break. \"OH!\" Luckily, the nurse was right nearby, and she came swiftly into the room. \"Mrs. Stiles, is everything alright?\" \"My water just broke!\" The nurse smiled. \"Well, then let's see what we can do about getting this baby born.\" She looked over at Willard. \"You the husband?\" \"Yes. Willard Stiles.\" \"Abigail Mason. Nice to meet you. Could you do me a favor and have your wife sit up a bit? It will make delivery easier. Also, you might want to get behind her and support her.\" Willard smiled. \"Okay. Abbie, sit up for a second.\" He slid behind her, and she leaned back into his chest. \"You comfortable?\" \"Willard, the last thing you ask a woman who is about to pass something the size of a watermelon out of a hole the size of a pea is if she is comfortable! I'll be comfortable once I have this baby out!\" Mrs. Mason smiled. \"Well, then start pushing.\" Abbie gritted her teeth, crushed Willard's hand in a death grip, and then pushed with all her might. \"YEEEEOOOWWW!\" Willard gently encouraged her. \"Come on baby, keep pushing. You're doing great, love. You're doing just great.\" \"GOD DAMN YOU WILLARD STILES! YOU….ARE….NEVER…TOUCHING…ME AGAIN!\" Willard pouted, and Mrs. Mason chuckled at his downcast expression. \"Mr. Stiles, don't pay any attention to that. I'm sure Annabelle will let you touch her again. Keep pushing dear, I can see the head. You're almost there.\" Abbie panted in exhaustion. \"I…can't…\" \"Yes you can. Just a few more pushes. Your baby is nearly here.\" Abbie took a deep breath, and then bore down with every bit of strength she had, screaming in pain. The sharp, indignant wail of a newborn infant pierced the silence, and Abbie fell back against Willard exhausted but happy. \"I did it.\" Mrs. Mason smiled. \"Indeed you did. Congratulations, you have a daughter. Would you like to hold her?\" Abbie immediately stretched out her arms, and Mrs. Mason gently wrapped the baby and placed her in her momma's arms. Abbie and Willard stared in rapt wonder at the little bundle. Willard was the first to find his voice. \"She's perfect, Abbie.\" Abbie nodded, tears of happiness running down her face. \"She is. She's so small.\" She smiled as her daughter opened her eyes. \"Hello, little bit. I'm so glad to finally meet you. You've got your Daddy's hair, and my eyes. I wonder if you'll have your Daddy's smile.\" Willard gently touched her tiny forehead. \"I have a daughter.\" Abbie smiled. \"You do. What should we call her?\" \"Karina. Karina Rebecca.\" Abbie glanced down at her babe. \"Hello, Karina.\" She rocked her gently, singing. \" Tell my ma when I go home, The boys won't leave the girls alone, They pulled my hair and stole my comb, But that's all right 'till I go home. She is handsome, she is pretty She is the belle of Belfast city, She is courting, one two three Please won't you tell me who is she? Albert Mooney says he loves her, All the boys are fighting for her, Knock on the door and they ring the bell Oh my true love, are you well? Here she comes, as white as snow, Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, Old Johnny Mary she says she'll die If she doesn't get the boy with the roving eye.

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high And the snow come tumbling from the sky She's as nice as apple pie She'll get her own boy, by and by When she gets a lad of her own, She won't tell her ma 'till she comes home, Let the boys stay as they will, For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.

She is handsome, she is pretty She is the belle of Belfast city, She is courting, one two three Please won't you tell me who is she?\" Willard smiled as his wife sang to their daughter. \"I never thought my life could be as perfect as it is now. I never thought my heart could feel so alive. I never thought I could be this happy or love two people this much. Abbie, I swear that I will never let anything happen to Karina or you, and that I will love both of you until the day I die.\" \"I'll hold you to that.\" Willard smiled. This was one promise that he knew he would keep. THE END.

I'm making it approximately nineteen to twenty-one years old. Sorry if I made a mistake about that. Happy. The overall appearance Paris had given her the moment she left the central airport was happiness. It was so unlike Los Angeles, her home. Instead of the usual traffic jam she was used to see, the streets of France were quite narrow and spread out. Of course, there was jams here and there, but it was not that what kept her staring. Plazas, lots and lots of plazas. Within every few minutes inside the moving car, Soo-Yung would see either a very huge or small town square. They were rather pretty, in fact. And inside, she could see families and couples enjoying their time with their children or pets. And not to mention miming, Soo-Yung got to see her very first miming show. It was funny how people painted their faces all white and got dressed in strange clothes. If her father hadn't been injured so badly, maybe she would've enjoyed the view. As much as she wanted to stay and savor her time, she had to get going. Reynard had warned her that if she was exposed out in the public for too long, her life would be at risk. At first, Soo-Yung was reluctant, not wanting to care. But then again, it was her father's wish that she was to be shielded from harm. She agreed. Soo-Yung looked out the widow of Reynard's limosine. They passed a restaurant, and she noticed a little girl goofing around with her parents. A small pang of jealousy hit her stomach. She tried to turn away, but she was too intrigued to their family outing to do so. Every once in a while, she would be envious of other people's personal lives. They had mothers, they had fathers, and they had siblings. She had one, but she wanted more. her father was always out with meetings or private, diplomatic trips to other countries. And she was always left alone with a few attendants. There was times she just wanted to be a normal young woman like the others in her school. And she hoped that maybe someday, her wish would come true. \"Soo-Yung, we're home.\" Reynard's warm voice broke into her thoughts. \"Home\", it was a strange term to call his big house. She was merely a guest, or at the least, a refugee. Offering the elder man a small smile, she was lead out the car. The interior of Renard's home was elegantly decorated, very much like the houses her father and she had lived in throughout their lives. Reynard gave her an reassuring laugh. As if on cue, a rather plump woman descended from the stairs. Seeing that their 'guest' had arrived, she let out a small squeal and Soo-Yung was enveloped in a tight hug. She remembered her. Tania, the wife of the French Ambassador, hadn't change even the slightest bit. Under her insistence, Soo-Yung called her by her name. \"Dear lord!\" Tania exclaimed. \"I'm so glad to see you, Soo-Yung.\" \"Me too, Tania.\" The Chinese woman returned the embracement with much difficulty. Clearing his throat, Reynard silently motioned to his wife that she was suffocating the poor girl. The woman stiffened and she sheepishly let go. Still beaming, Tania took Soo-Yung's suitcase. \"Come with me, darling. I'll show you your very own room.\" Soo-Yung didn't say anything, she just nodded. There wasn't much to talk about. After two days of constant pressure and nonstop danger, her body was wrecked and she needed time to herself. Tania led the way and she followed suit. Upstairs, she could see various rooms and lavatories. Turning right, her hostess stopped before a well carved out door and pushed it open. The young woman smiled. The room was big, much like a first class hotel. In the middle, a king-sized bed sat facing the opposite wall. A huge mirror and drawer stood by its side. And a nightstand was placed right by her great bed. But as much as she wanted to feel at ease, the whole place seemed to be out of place. The room was a little too big, and the luxurious aspect felt cold and hollow. \"Now the bathroom is behind that door.\" Tania pointed out. \"And your closet is right there by the corner. Make yourself comfortable, dear.\" The woman walked to the two doors by the side and a restroom made its appearance. Soo-Yung felt homesick. Her eyes watered. The sudden need of being alone became stronger. Setting her things beside the bed, Tania gave her one last hug before she disappeared from the room. Perfect. Now everything was quiet, just how she wanted it. Not wasting anymore time, she hastily ran into her lavatory. She untied her ponytail and the lose strands of black hair fell softly around her face. She stared at her reflection in the mirror. Soo-Yung, the wanted woman by the triads, the person everyone was itching to get their hands on, was alone. Empty. To them, her family was nothing but a bunch of junk that they could easily dispose of. She was trash in their eyes. A piece of trash that needed to be removed or else someone would trip over her. They thought she was a damsel in distress. Soo-Yung glared. Well, at least she showed them that she was no weakling at the night in the hospital, thanks to Inspector Lee. Gripping her towel tighter, she felt a few drops of tears slipping from her cheeks and silently into the sink. She would never be able to escape from their clutches. Never. Juntao was only the first, not the last. And she knew whoever that wanted to kill her father would come after her in no time. It was never going to stop. Even if Lee managed to get a hold of the assassin, there would still be more out there who wanted her and her father's blood. She hiccuped and held a hand to her mouth. \"Why?...\" Finally letting her sobs go free, Soo-Yung sank onto the ground by the door.[Chapter 2] Author's note: Ahhhh, after like a super long haitus (four years to be exact), I have updated this piece! As always, I don't own the Rush Hour franchise nor the characters. I really hope everyone can forgive me T.T Leave feedback if something is amiss and I'll learn from mistakes as always ;) Chapter TWO It was close to the afternoon by the time Soo-Yung felt comfortable enough to step out of the luxury bathroom. After a rather long cry-session, she felt her eyes fighting to stay in her sockets. Subconsciously, she looked into the mirror and almost burst into tears again. She looked horrible: paling cheeks, bloodshot eyes, and a drained appearance to everything. If Soo-Yung could laugh at herself, she would've. She wasn't the same woman who just came back from Hawaii four months ago. And she was definitely not the same woman who had hopes for a great college experience followed by a job and a life free of danger. \"Hah.\" She breathed out a sigh. \"Well, I'm a bit far from that right now…\" Soo-Yung gathered some clean clothes from her suitcase and dried herself up. She had to take her mind off of those things. In Paris, she was safe; Reynard was her best bet and she trusted the kind old man with all that's left of her heart. She glanced at her choice of outfit and managed a slight smile. Black jeans coupled with black leather boots and a white tank top with a beige cardigan. Yeah, it felt like she was about to head out for a girl's get-together brunch. Well, girl's night outs or brunches seemed to be a far-fetched concept for her now. What was left for her was lunch with her father's political friend under constant surveillance. Fun. Soo-Yung mentally slapped herself for straying into angst zone again. \"Agh, no more negative talk!\" She yelled to no one in particular. The isolation was really getting to her now. She had to go talk to someone, anyone actually, less she wanted to go insane. She combed her already straight hair to loosen up her nerves and tried positive self-talk. \"It's ok. You can do this. It's just simple lunch, no one's gonna hurt you… No one's going to hurt you.\" A small laugh escaped her soft lips. See, she felt a bit better already. She'll enjoy her stay in this manor and maybe she'll even get a chance to call her father...maybe. Soo-Yung grabbed the necklace Lee gave her and strode across the room. The night at the hospital was in the past. What was important right now was that she was safe, her father is alive, and the men sent to kill him are now gone. Her stomach growled in agreement and she groaned. A good lunch could sure calm her at the moment.[Chapter 3] Reynard was warm when he led her to the main dining hall. Soo-Yung felt impeccably small the moment she entered the vast room adorned with bright lights and scented candles. It was supposed to be a friendly gesture to her, but somehow she felt alone and cold despite the fireplace and candles. She sighed. Her mind was trying to drag her back down again. The elderly man broke into her musings. \"Dear, we had the chef make the most delectable Chinese cuisine in France. It is our honor you enjoy your stay.\" Soo-Yung smiled at the comment. Maybe she will like this place after all. \"I appreciate and am very grateful for all you do, Reynard.\" She turned her head to Tania and gave her a warm smile as well. On the table were an assortment of gourmet dishes: stir-fried shrimp, mapo tofu, deep-steamed artichokes, etc. Her stomach growled at her to quit moping and get eating, and for once, Soo-Yung agreed. Lunch started with light-hearted conversations. Tania cheerfully asked about her studies and she would politely respond. She had always wanted to go into public services in the medical field. The college she went to offered a vast amount of classes regarding such topic and Soo-Yung strived to achieve in most of her classes. \"I still have another year in school before I graduate.\" She answered. \"I'm hoping to cover all of my requirements this year before junior year ends so I can explore deeper into my major outside of my bachelor requirements.\" Tania beamed at the younger woman. \"Oh, I'm so proud of you, darling. Your father must be happy!\" The words settled into the air with a deafening silence. Reynard cast a rather dirty look at her and Soo-Yung almost gagged on her shrimp. It didn't take long for the sentence to hit her back in the face. Soo-Yung paused her fork midway towards her mouth before resuming her eating. it was then the idea that Soo-Yung may still be in trauma after what happened back in the hospital dawned on the elderly lady. Tania paled significantly. \"Sorry, sorry! It must've slipped from my mind again. I am sincerely sorry.\" Seeing her sputter helplessly, Soo-Yung widened her eyes in concern. \"No, it's alright, Tania! I was just caught off guard. I thank you for your condolences.\" She showed her host the prettiest smile she could manage and that seemed to still Tania's frantic motions. It was true that she was still hurting because of her father, but she wasn't going to stay down after the assassination attempt. She was stronger this time, and she was going to show the triads that she was not the same girl they saw Sang drag from the car ten years back. This time, everything will be different. Soo-Yung wouldn't let anyone hurt her father or herself, she'll see to that personally. She composed herself and tried to keep the atmosphere as friendly as possible. \"I just wanted to know how has my father been lately.\" Reynard raised an eyebrow and cleared his throat. \"Ambassador Han is recovering swiftly, dear. He shall be back for you in no time, I promise.\" Something was tingling in the back of her mind. Soo-Yung suddenly remembered a word that she had absent-mindedly acquired one day when she overheard her father discussing a matter with an unknown guest. At that time, she could not care less for it. But she had heard it from him time and time again, even Lee spoke about it one day when he thought she was out of earshot. The word was exotic to her ears. It sounded smooth and like a name; it was similar to a code word, but somehow not. Curiosity peeked and she could hold it no longer. \"Reynard.\" She softly called out. \"May I ask you something?\" The elderly man looked bemused. \"Of course, dear.\" She took in a breath and tried to control her pounding heart. This word could lead her to something, she just knew it. \"What exactly is Shy-Shen?\" It felt like an eternal time stop following the question. Tania seemed a bit perplexed while her husband appeared to have entered a ninety-degree drop from a roller coaster. The sound of a giggling Soo-Yung started out quiet, but she couldn't help it, and it erupted into a flow of girly laughter. \"What's so horrifying, Reynard?\" She tried her best to pull herself together. Had she been so down lately that she could laugh at the slightest slip of character? Almost as fast as he had been thrown off, Reynard fixed his expression back into his old demeanor. Tania followed suit as well and stammered something incoherent. Soo-Yung furrowed her brows; something felt off, her hosts seemed unreasonably uncomfortable. Frustration hit her as suddenly as the single word had. Was she considered so idiotic that she couldn't even be told a simple definition of a single word? Her angry thoughts were interrupted when Reynard coughed, temporarily distracting her. \"Shy-Shen is only a mythical person of the legends, dear.\" Reynard spoke calmly, his tone sounding as if he was walking on thin ice and didn't want Soo-Yung to fall in. \"Perfect!\" Soo-Yung said a little too loudly. \"Then what makes it so terrifying that everyone is scared out of their wits whenever it's said?\" She was doing her best not to break character and cry. All the hidden meanings in every conversation and the way she was confined like a prisoner were finally getting to her. She wanted answers, and fast. \"Darling, we understand your frustration.\" Tania's soothing voice brought her back to reality again, and she snapped her attention in her direction. \"Your father's situation is so confusing that even the highest officials in the country fail to have the rudimentary knowledge of it. I give you my promise that we will get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, you have to rest. I'm sure whatever will come will eventually happen, and we will all come to an understanding, darling.\" Her words were as cryptic as the fortune-telling of the monks. Soo-Yung mentally groaned. Everyone was trying to 'protect' her, everyone was trying to hide from her, and everyone was trying to get her. This wasn't going as planned. She clearly could not even get her closest people to confide in her, and she obviously wasn't leaving this place soon. She felt stuck and imprisoned all over again, on a more safer level, but still. Soo-Yung sighed and decided to let it go. The topic didn't seem to go anywhere and her eyes were drooping. Sleep was a good activity after a big lunch. \"I apologize for my rude behavior.\" Her voice was meek. \"Thank you for the appetizing meal. But I'm afraid I'm just too tired to carry on a sane conversation.\" She laughed a little at herself. \"I feel like taking a nap, honestly.\" Tania gave her a sympathetic look and smiled. \"Indeed you are, darling. You look like you haven't seen a pillow in weeks! Why don't you sleep a bit, and you can request dinner today at whatever time you wish.\" Soo-Yung nodded her head. \"Please excuse me.\" With little effort, she was scurrying out of the dining hall. All the information was still a tangled mess in her head. She was totally not herself and she needed to think clearly. She could worry about all the other miscellaneous issues later when she is actually Han Soo-Yung. She didn't look back, fearing the feeling of guilt that would creep up to her if she did. Unbeknownst to her, Reynard wide blue eyes had narrowed into two, very thin slits. His lips curled into an ugly smile.

I'm"},{"Movie":"Unknown","Title":"Of The Cold and Dark Days","Author":"genius-with-anxiety","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9657752","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was dark. And it was quiet, and I was scared. Could I do anything about it? No. I couldn't move, and I couldn't see. What I could do was sweat and cry in the hopes the Lord in all his goodness would save me from the danger I was being slowly gripped into. The barbed wire that held me in this prison cut deeply through my skin, tearing at the bones of my arms. The rope tied tightly around my mouth pulled at my jaw and caused complete and utter misery. I had to get out somehow. I just wish I knew how. I remembered very little of how I got here. I just sort of found myself here. One minute I was home, and suddenly there was a pound on my head. When I woke up, I was in a room with white walls, a well-lit ceiling, and one door. I had been transferred many times, from room to room, each one looking the same. I never saw the face of those who transferred me, I just felt hands grabbing my wrists, back before they were torn, and bringing me to another room. They didn't do much with me in any of them. Occasionally I was fed some moldy bread and water. It tasted awful, but at least I wasn't too hungry. Then, they transferred me to the dark room. I felt my wrists being bound by that horrible barbed wire, and the rope around my mouth being tied far too tight. They left me there; slipping in and out of consciousness. I heard footsteps pounding on the ground, getting closer and closer. I didn't know what to do, and the terror inside my body devoured me to the point where anxiety was all I knew, all I was feeling. I couldn't think of anything else but Oh God, I am going to die. The footsteps drew closer, and I grew more terrified. It reminded me too much of when I was transferred day after day, and the thought of having to do it over again wasn't exactly relieving. A rough hand gripped my mouth, and suddenly I felt a knife cutting into the rope that held my mouth shut. I was guided into a room. Let me rephrase that, I was shoved forward until I'd reached a room. They sat me down on a seat where I could see a plate with bread and cheese. It wasn't moldy or gross, it actually looked relatively appetizing. There was a glass of juice next to it. The man who had taken me to this room spoke. \"Please, eat; you need sustenance to go where you'll be going.\" He cut the wires and I took the bread. As I began to chew, the muscles in my jaw started to burn. I stopped and massaged it a little, which caused my wrists to hurt. It was almost impossible to eat, but the hunger it my stomach continued, so I forced myself through the pain and managed to finish my food. I then downed the juice and looked at the man sitting across from me. \"Why am I here?\" I asked him. He laughed. \"Heck, I don't know, I been here a long time and I still don't understand half the crap they shoving through my head.\" It was at that point that I got even more afraid and concerned. \"What do you mean?\" \"Oh, you didn't know? Let me tell you, yawl's is stupid. Real stupid. They are testin' medical things on your brain. Things they just don't knows good yet. If they're good, they keep 'em. If they're not, you're screwed.\" I immediately got up and ran out of the room. Medical testing? What did he mean? Had I been tested on? If so, maybe none of this was actually happening. I ran and ran and ran, hoping I could find an exit. But instead of an exit, I ran right into a man. A large, intimidating man. He grabbed my blood-crusted wrist and pulled me down to the floor. \"What are you doing in the halls?!\" He screamed at me so loud I swear I thought my eardrums were just going to shatter. I tried pulling away, but he grabbed my wrist again and the pain surged through my body, causing me to fall to the ground with a cry of horror. The man's voice rose again. \"I asked you a question. Now answer it. What are you doing in the halls?!\" \"I-I was, um, I was trying to find a bathroom.\" He laughed. Then he pulled my face right up against his. I nearly choked, his breath smelled so foul. What did he want anyway? And what did it have to do with me? \"You don't really think we'd let you use one do you? Bathroom…\" he chuckled to himself as he walked off, and I took the opportunity to have a look around. I walked down the hall and turned the corner. There was yet another long hallway, stretching out pretty far. That's when I noticed a door. It was one of many, but for some reason, it stuck out to me. I walked over to it and tried the handle. Locked. I tried another door. It was locked as well. After trying all the doors in the hall, I went back to the first one, took a deep breath, and knocked. I heard movement, but whoever was in there wasn't speaking. Someone was in there, I knew it. And if they were bound and gagged the same way I was, I needed to get them out. \"Hang on; I'll get you out of there.\" I looked around for cameras, and when I saw none, I pulled out a pin from my hair, or what was left of it. After a lot of struggling, the door gave way and I got in. A boy, I'd say about my age, was sitting there. Sweating and crying just like I was, and bound, just like I was, with barbed wire. He looked like he was in more pain than I was, so I immediately started to carefully unwrap the wire. I then untied the rope around his mouth and helped him up. \"What's your name?\" I asked him. He rubbed his eyes. \"My name is Portin. Portin Locifer.\" \"Well it's nice to meet you. I'm Agraina Loftkin.\" I wasn't sure if that was my actual name, really. I just thought that maybe it sounded a bit like the one I had back home. I turned and looked at this boy called Portin, and then motioned for him to follow me. We walked out and I looked around to be sure it was safe. It was. For now, of course. We walked on and looked for a door out. The place wasn't very secure, and only the doors containing people were locked. This made it very easy for us to get around. We looked for an open door, trying many to find one. Finally, we came across a door that led outside. When I opened it, I was nearly blinded by the light that it let in, as the building we were in was very dark. We stepped outside, and my hand slipped into Portin's. I didn't want to lose the only person next to me, even if he was a stranger. It was weird, though, almost like I had known him from somewhere else. I knew it couldn't be possible, because where ever I was, it couldn't be close to where I lived. When we got outside, I realized it was just a courtyard. But I didn't want to leave. So, with Portin following me, I walked out onto the path, and looked around at the trees and the plants and all of their beauty. It was so nice to be outside, because, to be honest, I have no idea how long I'd been in that room. Maybe years, they'd come in daily to give me the leftovers from what they had been eating, which had usually gone bad by then. I was starved, bleeding and alone for a long time. And now, I don't even remember what life was like before this dreadful thing happened to me. Looking at these trees reminded me. And I realized that regardless of how I tried, it may never be the same, and I may never escape. \"Look over there!\" Portin had found a door that may lead out. I ran to it and tried to open it. \"It's locked,\" I said sadly. I had been hoping and praying it would lead us to safety. We tried every door in the room, and they were all locked. \"Wait a minute,\" I said, starting to panic. \"The door we came out through. It's locked as well. We're trapped out here!\" \"What?!\" Portin cried out, he was very scared for being a 15-year-old boy. We ran into the middle of the garden and hid, because we could hear one of the doors unlocking. We hid inside a bush, trying to make ourselves hidden. We covered each other's mouths to ensure we didn't make any noise, and then hoped for the best. The person who unlocked the door spoke. \"Come out; come out, wherever you are!\" The footsteps got closer and closer, and I got scared again, if it weren't for Portin covering my mouth, I would have screamed. The man looked around, looked up in a few trees, and after searching through a couple of outside bushes, he started to move inward. Then, he finally decided to go back inside. I released a sigh of pure relief. We climbed out of the bushes and I picked the lock on the door we tried first. Just as I opened it, I caught a glimpse of a bright stage light. The doors lead into a large arena. There were people fighting, beating each other up. The arena was small, so we kept hidden. As I watched the brawlers, I saw the same blood marks on their wrists. \"Oh my gosh,\" I whispered to myself. \"They're from the cells. We'd be doing this same exact thing!\" \"No,\" Portin replied. \"I would. I've done this before. It's only the boys who fight. The girls get abused.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"You know what I mean.\" \"No,\" I started crying. Not for me, but for Portin. How could he have fought these fist fights and survived? I wasn't the strongest, but I was pretty sure I was stronger than him. How he could have lasted this long baffled me. He had looked more damaged than me when I found him, but still, he must have been far more damaged than that. I was starting to lose my sanity, and it wasn't going to well. Just as I was calming down, I saw one of the boys pick up a chair leg and twist it into the other's skull. Blood spilled everywhere. I started bawling, but thankfully by now we were under the bleachers, and there was so much cheering above us that they couldn't hear me. Portin wrapped his bony little arms around me. \"You're going to be ok,\" he whispered gently. \"Soon we'll be out of here. Come on, let's go.\" He led me through the door we came in through, and we looked around a bit more. We tried a couple more doors, but all of them were to no avail. Except for when we opened a closet. It was dark , and it was full of weapons. Bows, pistols, machine guns, knives, and grenades. I pulled a few of the pistols out, and Portin grabbed a bow and a quiver of arrows. \"I'm real good at shooting with a bow,\" He explained. I was never any good. I could never keep the arrow in the bow and I didn't understand how it fired. But I was good with guns, I always was. I could blow a man's head off from a mile away if I wanted to. I pulled some ammo from a shelf and grabbed Portin. We then opened the door that lead inside and marched through. I wasn't afraid anymore. It was as if any fear I had before had been lifted, and I could shoot down whoever threatened me. A man approached us, wire in hand, and I shot both his feet. He screamed in pain as I walked on. Little did I know there was an alarm set up in the building. The man who I'd shot got up, using the side rail to pull himself up, and pushed the button that caused it to sound. It was at that point that men came pouring in from everywhere. I saw Portin trying his best to defend himself. But before I knew it, he was being beaten and thrown down to the ground. I remember screaming his name, hoping he'd break through. I turned around and punched the men behind me as hard as I could, but they got me down too, and before I knew it, I was unconscious.[Chapter 2] I woke up in a room full of people. All teenagers, like me, all miserable in their own way, and all bound in pairs by barbed wire. The place stunk of sweat and filth. I craned my neck to see if Portin was here. Then I turned my head around to see me and him were bound together, the barbed wire forming new scars on our wrists and arms, and now even our legs. It was probably the most miserable part of being here. But at least he was safe. As safe as he could be when he was in here, of course. That's all I cared about right now, was that me and Portin were safe. Suddenly I heard his voice; I suppose he had woken up too. \"Agraina?\" He called. \"I'm here.\" I replied. \"Do you think we're going to be ok?\" He sounded very scared, but very brave. \"I don't know; let's just focus on getting out of here. Try and talk to the others. See what they know.\" We tried making conversation with the other prisoners, but they wouldn't speak. They kept on shaking their heads, saying no speak, no speak. It was almost as if they had been brainwashed. They weren't scared, and they weren't talking to each other either. In fact, a lot of them were asleep. The place was completely quiet except for the sounds of breathing and me Portin talking. I wanted to get out of here more than anything. The problem was that I simply didn't know how to get out, and if I did, I wouldn't know where to go. There were multiple doors, probably all leading to different places. Lord knew which one might have led directly out, but whichever one did, I wanted to find it. There were lots of other people in the room, and there were a couple guards stationed by each door. As I looked over at them, they caught my glance and started to walk over to me. But as they made their way towards the area where me and Portin sat, they were interrupted by another guard. They walked back over to their station, arguing amongst themselves. They seemed irritated; like someone had told them they weren't allowed to go outside and play. I thought we'd be fine, until they walked over to me and injected me with some sort of sleeping draft. I don't remember much from then on, until I awoke with a start to find I was in a different room. This time I was chained by my ankles to a wall, and this time, I was alone. I started to panic. Where was Portin? Where was I? I didn't even know where I was, although, I had gotten used to that. I got up and looked through the cell window, frantically trying to get out, frantically trying to find Portin. But he was nowhere, and there were no doors as far as I could see. I wanted out, that's all. Just out. I think I was starting to go mad. I couldn't function, and my vision suddenly worsened. It was at that point that I fell over and collapsed completely. I awoke to the sound of crying and screaming, and when I opened my eyes I saw people getting dragged out of their cells by the hair, their screams echoing throughout the cell block. Before I knew it there was a hand on my blond hair and I was being dragged away. I didn't know what to do, I wanted to kick whoever was carrying me, but I couldn't lift my leg without pain shooting through my scalp. So I let them drag me. I was pulled into a large, round room where all I could see was one light, in the middle of the room. Just a candle, and there was a round table on which it stood. I walked in, only to hear chains rattling. There were about 7 other girls, like me, who were being led in. There were about 20 chained to the wall. If the girls could reach the meal placed on the table, they could eat and live on here with proper food and clothing. If they did not, they would be put back in their cell and starved to death. I was attached to one of those chains. I reached my head as far as I could, but I still could not reach the food. I craned my neck, rubbed my hand raw against the chains, but still to no avail. I collapsed, only momentarily, for I was shoved up by one of the guards. I reached again, still not being able to reach the bread. But it was then that I realized I could reach the plate. If I could do that, maybe I could get the food. I pulled myself as far as I could, bit the plate and pulled it towards me. It slid off the table, and shattered as it hit the ground. I grabbed the bread with my teeth, and held it up for the guards to see. When they unchained me, I ran through the doors screaming Portin's name. Evidently you can choose one other person to be with you. Of course, I'd choose him. I went up to the guard and asked for Portin. He just stared at me blankly. \"You think I know who he is? We have hundreds of you. Some of you go to testing, some of you go to fighting, and some of you play the food game. \"When he explained this to me, my entire body nearly shut down. I ran through the rooms, following the signs until they brought me to the room that I was assigned. I opened the door, shot in, and shut it. But as I was gasping for breath, I was startled by a familiar voice. It was Portin's. \"I thought you'd be here soon,\" he said, with a rasp in his voice. I looked over at him and he was covered in blood, cuts and bruises all up and down his legs, and his face was cut very deeply across his cheek. \"Oh my gosh! What happened to you?\" I screamed in horror at the sight of his injury. \"I was beaten, only a little,\" he replied. \"Besides, it doesn't hurt much.\" I ran to his side. \"Not much? Portin, you're very badly injured. There must be something in this room that can help clean the wounds. I went through the bedroom, then the kitchen, then the bathroom. There were some towels in the bathroom, so I grabbed them and brought them out, along with a rinse cup of water. I found some plastic that had been covering the furniture, laid it on the ground, and helped Portin onto it. I then began to cleanse the wounds he had on him, and not surprisingly put him through a lot of pain. The poor boy, he must have gone through so many traumas. Maybe it wasn't even the wounds that hurt; maybe it was the memories. He almost screamed, but I had to quiet him, because if someone knew I was hiding him, I might get in trouble. Of course, technically I wasn't; they said I could take someone with me. Still, I felt nervous about having him here. I suppose if we lay low, nothing would happen to us. I ripped off what was left of my jacket and tied it around his legs, so that the bleeding would stop. Then I found a small band-aid in the bathroom for his cheek. \"Why are you helping me, anyway?\" Portin inquired. \"I'm really not all that special, and we've just met.\" I almost started to cry. \"I don't know where I am, I don't know why I'm here, and you're the only other person that I can talk to who feels the same way. We're going to get out of here. Together. I promise.\" I held his hand for a little bit, feeling its warmth; and then the two of us drifted off to sleep. We awoke to the sound of knocking on the door. I heard a voice through the door. \"Room service!\" Were my ears defying me? I guess this place was some sort of hotel. A hotel that kidnaps people, which was the interesting bit. I got Portin hidden away in the bedroom, and then went to answer the door. The man at the door didn't appear phased by the fact that I was dirty and bruised, in fact, if my eyes didn't deceive me, there was a big first-aid kit on the bottom shelf of the cart. He pushed it in, left it in the middle of the room, and then walked out. I walked over to the cart and took a look at it. There was enough food for one fat person, but seeing as me and Portin were both starving, this was enough food for an army. I called him in, and we ate the breakfast provided; pancakes with maple syrup and bacon, little coffee cakes with orange juice and milk, and fresh fruit to go along. We ate every last crumb, and after being satisfied, I took a look in the wardrobe, to see what I could wear. There were many things, all of them very pretty, but before I put one on, I told Portin I was getting in the shower. I found some clothes for him, too, and then finally washed my body. The moment I turned on the water I knew for a fact that I was in pure heaven. But there was no way this heaven could last forever. I tried on a pair of shorts I'd found in the closet, and, pleased to know they fit, kept them on. I also found a pretty satin shirt, loose and comfortable, and pink, the color that I always thought looked best on me. Then I blow-dried my hair, and put it in a French braid in the back of my head. There were earrings, too, but not only did I not want to be bothered with them, but if my ears had been pierced, I've been here so long that the holes have closed up. I came in the living room to find that Portin was already showered and dressed. I guess it took a much longer time for me. His wounds looked a lot cleaner, and so did the rest of him. \"How was your shower?\" I asked. He took a deep, relaxed breath. \"Wonderful. Seriously the best thing I've felt in months.\" \"Well I'm glad you think so,\" I replied. \"Let's see what's going on in the world, shall we?\" I turned on the TV, and all over the news were broadcasts about children going missing everywhere. The reporter seemed terrified. Suddenly my face was on the screen; my parents must have sent a picture in! \"That's you, Agraina!\" Portin pointed at the screen. \"I know,\" I replied. \"We really need to get out of here. Maybe there's a phone where we can call my parents. I still remember their phone number, I think.\" I rummaged through the place, but there was no phone. I was disappointed. \"Ah, I see, we live here but at a price, no communication. Too bad I won't put up with that.\" Portin looked concerned. \"You can't just fight off a huge army of people! They'll kill you before you have a chance to do anything!\" \"Well that's a risk I'm willing to take,\" I said. \"Come on, we need to make plans.\" I pulled out a long sheet of paper that I'd found in the bedroom. I drew out all the places we'd been and where they led to. I drew the weaponry, and the torture rooms, even the one we were in then. Yet it still was random and I didn't know how I would figure out how to use these rooms to get anywhere. Then Portin came up with an idea. \"I'm really good at hacking computers,\" he explained. \"If we could hack through to the cameras, we could see all the rooms, and then figure out how to get out of here.\" I laughed. \"That's a great plan, Portin, however, we're not just going to get out of here anymore. We're going to help all the people who are being treated just like us. But go ahead and use the computer. Maybe we can hack security and email our parents, let them know we're safe.\" Portin grabbed the computer that the hotel provided and got to work. It was a little difficult for him to get past the firewall at first, mainly because the only thing you could really get into was the hotel website, but he did it. Once we were in, we saw all the cameras. There were a few outside the building, which was great because then we could see what it looked like. It wasn't as big as I thought it'd be, and actually, there was something really strange about it. \"Hold on,\" I took control of the touch pad. \"I've seen this building before. It's only a few blocks away from where I live!\" \"What?\" Now Portin looked really scared. \"How can it be? I remember being blindfolded on the drive up. It took me hours to get here!\" I stared at him. \"Oh my gosh, you were conscious? I just remember getting here, I was at home, and then I was here. But you probably live farther away than me, right?\" \"That must have been terrible, but I think being conscious is worse. They torture you and taunt you. But yeah, I probably do.\" \"That must have been worse,\" I replied, concerned. \"It was, but right now we need to focus on some things that are more important.\" \"You're right. Ok, so, where are there guards stationed?\" We talked it over, watching the cameras and looking at entrances and exits. And for the first time in a long time, I was legitimately having fun. I know it seems strange, making plan to escape a place you don't even know how you got into, but I was laughing happily, and I was shoving Portin around (carefully of course, I didn't want to hurt him), and I was talking. Soon, we ended up lying on the floor, just relaxing. Maybe we didn't have to leave. Maybe we could just stay here, only for a little while. After all, they wouldn't harm us, would they? \"Portin?\" my voice sounded loud in the quiet we now had. \"Do you know what?\" \"What?\" he replied. \"I'm having the best time ever.\" I wrapped my arms around him, and we just sat there, in a warm embrace. I was so glad to have him as a friend, and I didn't think there was any possible way things could get any better. Although, they could get worse.[Chapter 3] Later that day, after lunch, I opened the laptop to look at the cameras. We had been doing it for a while now, just to check up, see if there was any extra activity going on. When I looked at the screen, I was shocked at what I saw. \"Portin! Come here!\" Portin came running in and looked at the same thing I did. The camera that showed the outside showed a different building. None of these buildings were the outside. It was a trick. They knew we were watching the cameras, and they tricked us. \"What are we going to do?\" I started to get worried. \"I don't know,\" Portin said doubtfully. \"Pack up, leave?\" \"Can't we stay here?\" I pleaded. \"Agraina, look,\" Portin said calmly. \"If we don't get out of here, then eventually something is going to happen to us. We need to go now.\" I sighed. \"Fine,\" I said angrily. We started packing our things in a suitcase that we'd found in the wardrobe. I made sure to bring along any weapons that might be useful. Guns, knives, I made sure to get the bow for Portin. Somehow, even after we were taken, our weapons remained with us. Either they were really stupid or they wanted us to have them. Whatever their purpose was, I was glad to still have the weapons with us. As I looked around, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It looked like a body. I let out a scream so loud maybe my parents could have heard me. Portin came running in from the bedroom. \"What on earth was that for?\" he asked, sounding worried. \"I-I…\" I paused to take a breath. \"I saw someone in here; they were- I don't know, I saw someone!\" Portin took a deep breath and sat me down. \"It's alright; you must have just been seeing things. Come on, we've got to keep packing.\" He helped me put the rest of the clothes in a suitcase and brought me a cup of coffee from the breakfast station. \"Here,\" he said. \"You must be running on no sleep. It's been a while since you've had some caffeine. Drink this.\" I took the coffee and sipped it, relaxing a little bit. I don't know what was happening to me; but whatever it was, I intended to figure it out. We had just finished packing when there was a knock on the door. I motioned for Portin to run and hide under the bed, and he ran. I went to answer the door, and when I looked through the peephole, I saw the same figure I'd seen before. I stifled my scream, hoping that maybe it was nothing. After taking a deep breath, I opened the door. There was no one there. I looked from one side of the hall to the other, but there was no one. I slammed the door shut once more. \"Portin!\" I called. There was no answer. I ran into the bedroom to find there was no one in the room. \"Portin!\" I called again, still no answer. I was starting panic-again. He was nowhere to be found, not in this room, no anywhere. I fell on the ground and started to cry. Where had he gone? Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. When I turned around to see who it was, I saw that it was Portin. \"What's wrong, Agraina?\" he didn't understand why I was crying, and he looked perfectly healthy. Besides his cuts and bruises, of course. \"I called for you, and you didn't answer. Where were you?\" \"I was under the bed. You didn't call for me,\" he replied. Now I was really confused. What had just happened? Was I imagining things? This put my mind on a tail spin. I had no idea what was going on. Suddenly darkness was closing in. Portin's brown eyes faded from me, and I was unconscious. AGAIN. When I awoke, I was no longer in the hotel room. I was somewhere else. All the walls were white and there was an unfamiliar woman standing over me. \"You are not well,\" she said. She sounded very foreign. Possibly Indian? I wasn't sure, but I intended to find out. I tried to get up, but whoever this woman was, she pushed me back down. She seemed like she was worried I'd see something, like maybe she was hiding something. \"You cannot get up. Your condition is too severe.\" I didn't get it. \"Severe? What do you mean? Where am I?\" \"You are in hospital. This boy, he brings you here.\" She pointed to the chair in the corner. There sat Portin, waiting patiently. I almost burst into tears, just the sight of him made me want to cry. Come to think of it, I wasn't exactly sure why, though. I held back because I needed to know what was wrong with me. \"You said my condition is severe. What is my condition?\" The woman looked at me strangely.\"You didn't know? You have experienced several heart attacks, which is very, very unusual at your age. It's also very unhealthy. You need to stay here for a while. We will take care of you. Do not worry.\" I worried. There was no doubt I worried. 15 years old and having heart attacks? Nobody I've ever known has had those problems before. Could she have been lying? It was perfectly possible, and you could practically smell the tension in the air. It was like she was waiting for someone to snap and tell me the truth. I didn't know what to say, so I decided to ask a question that was as safe as possible. \"What causes heart attacks?\" I asked. \"Many things,\" the woman replied. \"Stress, too much bad food, but in your case, I think it was a sudden shock that caused yours. You see, with the condition your body is in, all that running and torture, your heart couldn't take all the pressure.\" \"How do you know about the running and torture?\" I was beginning to get suspicious. More so than I'd already been. Portin cut in. \"I told her. I thought it might be useful to know you haven't exactly been the healthiest lately.\" Something sounded strange about him; though I wasn't quite sure what. He sounded… distant. Like, someone had control over what he was saying. The woman started to speak again. \"Do not worry,\" she said. \"We will take care of everything.\" I didn't believe her. Or Portin, for that matter. Something was wrong. But what? I needed to find out. I wanted to search the room, try and get them to leave so I could do so. But first, I needed to recover. It had been a few days since I had been awake last, and in those few days a lot had happened. Portin told me stories of how the men came in looking for Agraina Loftkin, and how he told them she wasn't here, she was somewhere else, and that they believed him; he told me of when the food had all gone bad from someone leaving the fridge open and their head being hung in the door. I couldn't believe my ears; this was the 21st century and people were being beheaded! It was savage! I tried asking him more, but then he acted all strange, like there wasn't anything wrong and I didn't need to know any more. But I did need to know more! He needed to answer. But the more I pressed, the less he said, so I decided to leave it alone. I went back to sleep a few minutes later.210 I awoke with a start when I heard Portin coughing and gasping for breath, sayings \"please no, please, stop it\" over and over again. I immediately jumped out of bed and ran to his side. \"Portin what's wrong?\" I asked frantically, hoping for an answer. \"Listen, you have to help me,\" he grasped my arm and gripped it tightly. \"They're trying to hurt me. I have to lie to you, all the time, I can't do it, I-\" he was interrupted by a fit of coughing, and he started to choke. I started crying, I didn't know what to do. No one came to help, and I was starting to worry, I didn't think he'd make it. He kept on coughing and coughing, and then, it stopped. He collapsed. He started breathing again. I relaxed a little, and then I brought him in my bed and slept on the couch. When I awoke, he was back to normal. I started to relax a bit, and the only reason I'd gotten sleep last night was because I was exhausted. I got out of bed, slipped on a shirt, and peeped out of the room. When I looked down the halls, the only thing I saw was the same hallways as the hotels. This room was only made to look like a hospital room, but it wasn't one. Were those really heart attacks? Had I even been ill this entire time? When I came back into the room, everything was different. There were no beds, it looked just like the room we'd been staying in before! And Portin was gone. Again. How many times? I searched the whole room, and found him sleeping in the living room couch. I released a sigh. He was alright. I went back into the hall. As I walked through it, the floor pattern changed. And then the walls shifted. Before I knew it, I was in a completely different room. It was large, and it had many doors around it. Right in the middle, there was a pattern on the floor. It was in the shape of a dove, a white one, and it was just about to take flight. It was pretty, but I didn't quite understand why it was there. I walked over and touched it; and when I did, it flew off. I followed it as far as I could, but I could not reach it. It was a beautiful dove, white as snow and pure, but it had red eyes that pierced through my soul, or so it felt like. I turned around and the room changed again; this time it was a small room, with little red lights strung about it. There was a little table, and a small bed. There was a child lying in the bed, very small, I'd say about 5 or 6 years old. She was sleeping very peacefully. Then she turned to smoke and disappeared. I looked around, then opened the door and walked back down the halls. I ran into Portin. He seemed worried, but it didn't surprise me at all. I mean, we had been separated so many times now. I wasn't sure, but I thought I saw irritation on his face as well. \"Where have you been?\" He exclaimed. \"I've been looking everywhere for you!\" \"You were asleep,\" I told him. \"You were in the hospital room, and then it changed to a hotel room. You were asleep on the couch and I left, and you were gone. So where were you?\" He looked at me and yawned. \"I was asleep; like you said. I woke up and you weren't there, so I got up. That's when the room changed for me.\" \"What did your rooms look like?\" I asked. \"Well,\" he replied. \"There was a gun training room, and a cave, Oh! And some sort of hut? Anyway, it was really weird. What about you?\" \"I saw a room with a dove on the floor. Then it flew away. And then I was in this- this sort of hut as well. Did yours have a sleeping little girl in it too?\" \"Yes! It did! Did she vanish into smoke?\" \"Yes! Does this mean we were in the same room?\" \"I don't know, but I think there might be two different versions of these rooms, maybe more, running parallel to each other. We should probably find out. Come on, let's split up.\" \"Wait!\" I interrupted him. \"We shouldn't. We might end up separated forever. I don't want that.\" \"Fine,\" he replied. \"We'll go together. But we need to work quickly. I don't think it would end well if someone found us.\" \"Ok. Let's go.\" I grabbed the gun from pocket and we set off, through a million shape-shifting rooms, all stretching and changing as we ran through them. Suddenly there was one that caught my eye. It was a hallway that looked very familiar. I grabbed Portin's arm and led him in with me. There was a door that had stickers all over it. The stickers read \"Alana's Room KEEP OUT\" In colorful text. I stared at it. I opened the door, and inside was my old bed, along with my dresser and closet. There was the little window seat I spent hours reading in. I sat down and looked around the room where all the memories stayed. There was the balcony I snuck off of, there were all the books and movies I had saved, I had read them and watched them over and over again; never wanting to put them down. There was the little nick in the wall where I had bumped my chair into it. I ran my fingers over it. With a nostalgic sigh, I decided to explore some other spots. When I left the hallway, there was the kitchen I raided food from all the time. I felt tears begin to stream down my face. Embarrassed, I wiped them away as quickly as I could. It was too late. Portin noticed. \"Is this-is this your house?\" He asked. I knew he meant well, but it just made things was worse. I burst into tears and collapsed on the floor. He just stood there looking at me. I didn't blame him for not knowing what to do; it's not very often that he's around bawling girls. So I tried to suck it up. I got up, started drying my tears, and finally I started speaking. \"Yes,\" I said, my voice cracking a little. \"Yes, this is my house. It just reminded me of back when I was home. It just made me sad that it was empty. I'm sorry for bursting out like that; I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.\" Portin looked at me. He seemed relaxed. \"It's fine. I would have done the same thing if it was my house.\" At that very moment the house changed to another house. I assumed it was Portin's, but I didn't want to traumatize him. \"Come on, we have to get out of here!\" I grabbed his arm and pulled him out the front door. We ran through room after room until we were far away from that house. As we caught our breath, I looked over and saw something. It was shining. I picked it up, and saw that it was my pin, from when I was younger. I'd wear it at parties. It was so beautiful. Sometimes, I would curl my hair, pull it back, and pin it with this exact pin. But I was always sad because no one told me I looked beautiful in it. So I put it in a case and locked it in my dresser drawer. I hid the key, and it never saw the light of day again. I turned it over it my hands, inspecting it; looking at the shimmer it produced. I loved that pin once, and now? Now I hated it. I threw it to the ground and looked at Portin. \"Let's go,\" I said. We ran through the rooms once more, and suddenly, it shifted back into the halls. Some men walked in with a kid wrapped tightly in their grasp. I stood there, stunned until Portin grabbed my arm and yanked my behind a wall. My whole face grew red with anger, and hot tears sprang from my eyes. \"We have to set her free!\" I practically growled the words out. \"No,\" Portin said. \"We would kill ourselves. I can't have that.\" I felt my whole body start to shut down. \"I- I don't care if I die. My life doesn't matter anymore.\" Portin let a tear fall from his own face. \"It matters to me,\" he said. \"Agraina, I can't lose you. Now come on, let's get out of here.\" He led me through halls and doors until we reached an exit. I recalled everything that I could remember in that moment. The running from place to place, how quickly everything had happened; it had all been a blur to me. When we walked out those doors, I thought it would all be over. Little did I know that it was just beginning… We walked outside the doors, and as I looked around, all I saw were rocks. Rocks stacked up so high you couldn't see anything. Only the sky, which had turned a horrid red. Deep and dark, like the color of blood. I looked around, and all I could see was darkness. There were men and women picking food out of the ground, like I knew how it got there and where it came from. Which I didn't. I went up to a woman who had dug a few chunks of bread out of the ground. She looked up at I approached. \"Excuse me ma'am, but what's going on?\" I asked, trying to sound as polite as possible. \"What's going on?\" The woman asked. She seeming shocked I even spoke to her at all. \"The world is gone! We are refugees, digging whatever is left out of the ground! Where have you been?\" \"Nowhere, I've been in that building,\" I replied. The woman stared at me, now more concerned than ever. \"In there?\" She pointed to the building behind me, just as it shifted into a small cottage. I couldn't believe what I had just seen. Was it possible? Or was my mind just playing tricks on me? I had gone through a lot. I turned back to the woman, only to see she had gone. Now I was very confused. More so than I already was? Probably, yes. I looked all around the small cottage only to find that other than Portin, I was completely alone. Then I turned around to see Portin. He was looking at me strangely. But in a way, I liked the way he looked. Before I knew it, his arms were wrapped around me. It was just a hug, but it certainly felt nice. After the embrace, I turned my head to see the cottage was now a skyscraper. I couldn't even get a hold on what was going on here. My body started to get to me, like I couldn't control myself. Yet again, everything was fading and I lost consciousness.[Chapter 4] When I awoke, I realized I was still in the same place that I passed out. Not surprisingly, Portin was right there, hanging over me. Actually, he was smacking me in the face. I immediately shot up, slightly irritated but at the same time grateful for his violent way of waking me up. I didn't know he had that in him, that violent way of reviving someone. He had always seemed like a really sweet person, but I suppose not. Maybe it was the traumatizing experience of everything that had happened that had caused him to get so attached to people. I guess this attachment just wore off after a while. Or maybe…I had never really picked up on the problem that he had been having earlier. What was that? Someone had gotten control over his brain, they had been making him say things that he didn't want to, and he was fighting it for a long time; only now I wasn't sure if he'd fought it off or if it had taken complete control. I didn't have time to deal with it at that moment, though, so I changed the subject. \"How long have I been out?\" I grumbled, feeling like I hadn't slept for years. \"He looked down at me. \"Only a few minutes. I woke you up almost as soon as you fell asleep. Namely because of that.\" He pointed at a large ship just over head. It was monstrous, and the last thing I needed was to be right underneath it. I grabbed Portin's hand, and after letting out an enormous scream, ran as quickly as I possibly could. The ship picked up speed, flying the other direction. I didn't realize why until we were standing in the middle of a cloud of smoke. It was gas. I screamed yet again and we ran the other direction, as so not to get gassed. But the cloud was moving faster than we were, and I didn't know if this gas was fatal or not, so I couldn't afford to breathe it in. I pulled the collar of my shirt up over my mouth and motioned for Portin to do the same. We ran behind one of the rocks, coughing and gasping for breath, but the more we breathed in, the worse we felt. Finally, I decided we needed to leave. Now. If we didn't, we would die. Already I felt whatever food I'd eaten before coming up. I gulped it down just in time to say something to Portin. \"We need to find a better hiding spot!\" Already I found myself choking and gagging once more. I looked around, desperately trying to find a place to hide, but this area was practically a field! There was nothing out there. Nothing. I whirled around, trying to find something, just something that could work to our advantage. That's when I saw it. Black and smoking, but it was still there. Shelter. I ran towards it, pulling Portin, who was lagging behind. That's when it shifted into something else. I had just turned to the shape shifting building. So that left me with two choices; either die out here in the smoke and gas, or die in there after being caught. It was then I realized it really didn't matter. I didn't have any idea how long I'd been in that building. Or how old I was. Or even where I was. This couldn't be Earth, could it? If so, how long has it been since things were normal? I tried to brush the thought aside, but I couldn't. And now it wasn't the gas that was killing me, it was the thought in my head that there was no hope for humanity. And that is what really disappointed me. Despite my lack of talent, I was pretty sure of whom I was, for practically my whole life. After all, why shouldn't I? But now, at the moment where I needed to remember it most, I'd forgotten who I was and why I was here. And that was when I realized it. I had been unconscious for a while, because I awoke to find Portin standing over me. I could hear him saying something about the gas leaving, but I didn't quite understand it. That's when I started to feel the stinging in my eyes. So it was teargas that had been sprayed everywhere. Teargas that sent me running. Obviously I hadn't been exposed to for too long, otherwise I'd be blinded. I sat up and looked around. We were still outside. Strangely enough, everything had cleared. Everything except the building, of course. And the diggers, still positioned at their posts, digging though the ground. It was a long time before I realized that there was nothing left in the ground, yet they were still digging. I went up to the same woman I spoke to before, and tapped her shoulder. She turned around calmly, but when I saw her face, it was heavily disfigured. Burns and scars covered the face that once looked at me with terrified eyes. Seeing this, I wondered if I was hallucinating. But I didn't feel different. I was scared of the face, of course, but I was in my right mind. That left only one explanation. She had somehow gotten burned. By the gas? No, it was teargas. All these thoughts flashed through my mind before I let out a scream of fear. I couldn't believe what was happening. Was any of this even real? It had to be. Then I started to remember things. Like how when I was really little people got this disease where they'd be fine, but the then the next minute, their face would dissolve into a burnt mess, much like the one I had just seen. A few days later, a brilliant scientist came up with a cure, but we didn't know about it until many people had died from the infection. Despite his discovery, he was put in prison for withholding important information. I remember the way he looked, how my older sister always said she was going to marry him. She-my older sister! I had completely forgotten I'd even had an older sister before now. She had always teased me about my hair, because for some reason she hated people with blonde hair. Not for the normal stereotypical reason, but because she though they looked really pale with it. It didn't ever make much sense to me, especially because I've always been a relatively tan person. Of course, her hair was black as night, and her skin was really pale. She burned easily, and she was very skinny, which was very different from my tall, stocky build. We got along alright, I guess, but when in public people probably thought we hated each other. Honestly, I did hate going places, so it made sense that I was rude to her. None the less, she still was rude to me as well. I suppose that's because I embarrassed her. Oh well, right? That's what little sisters are for. She taught me a lot, too. Like how to get over things quickly, be very insensitive, and how to be one of the most obnoxious, rude people in the universe. Although part of that was me. It's just who I am, I'm not the kind of person who will keep on talking to someone I dislike just to be nice. In fact, if I dislike someone, I usually make it very obvious. I always have. It's just part of my personality. I doubt anyone considers that to be a good trait in someone, but I suppose it really doesn't matter. At least to me, the rest of my family hated my personality! I just wish I could meet someone who understood that. I highly doubt Portin would, he's so much nicer than me. And as for anyone else I know, they're probably dead anyway. So there's that. I turned around to look and see where Portin had gone. I'd spent so much time thinking I suppose I sort of forgot myself. In a way, it's a good thing, in this situation, not so much. He was over by a rock, rolling something between his thumb and pointer finger. I didn't know what it was, so I went over to find out. When I got closer, I realized the object was smaller than I thought. I tapped his shoulder. \"Portin?\" he seemed a little distracted, so I called out a few more times. \"Come on, Portin, answer me. What do you have?\" He turned around and showed me what he's been looking at. \"I don't know exactly what it is. I think it's some sort piece of jewelry that was melted down from the heat.\" It was very hot here. I have no idea why, maybe the atmosphere had been heated up from something. But what? I sure wish I knew. Unfortunately, I did not. I looked around again, seeing if there was anything I could do. But we were completely encased by a tall rock structure. That's when I saw a small doorway in the bottom of the rock. I made my way towards it, and then, remembering that Portin was still over inspecting the small silver lump, I called him over. \"Look what I found,\" I said cheerfully. Well, as cheerful as one can be when their life is being or has been destroyed. Portin looked over at me. Was it concern that I read on his face? I didn't know for sure, so I decided to just shrug it off. \"Do you think it leads outside the rock?\" He asked. \"Possibly, but we'll have to find out. And there's only one way to do that. We have to go through,\" I told him. We walked through it; and we were soon surrounded by stone. The ceilings were pretty high for it being a tunnel, and the walls were cold and rough to the touch. There were a few torches along the walls to keep it lit, but other than that, the tunnels were completely dark. It seemed to stretch on forever, each twist and turn becoming more and more confusing. There were fewer torches than there were before, so the lighting became very dim. I ended up running my fingers along the wall to make sure we were still going through the tunnels and we hadn't ended up in some cavern. After everything, walking through a dark tunnel was actually relaxing. We weren't running from anything, and we weren't doing any life threatening feats. Thank God, if I didn't get this walk I think I might have gone completely insane. It's sort of like a day I had recently remembered. My parents had gotten into a huge argument, and my sister was trying to get them to stop. She wasn't doing a very good job of it, and my brother – oh, I had a brother! – had just burst into tears because he thought they were going to split up. I was completely fed up because of all of it, so I decided to get out. My bedroom had a door that led to a balcony. I wasn't supposed to go out on it, because it was old and the wood had given way in some spots. I was always a heavy person; so naturally, they thought I'd break it. But the beams that supported the rotted wood were still fine, so I took some stuff from my room and laid them over the beams. I used those and a safety ladder that no one used or noticed was missing, and created a sort of secret escape place. None of my parents knew about it because the side of our house that the balcony was on was so covered by shrubbery and it was so close to the other house that you could barely walk. Except I had created a sort of secret path through it so I could leave whenever I wanted. With them all fighting like this, they wouldn't notice if I'd slipped off. So I snuck off to my room, opened the door to the balcony and slipped quietly down the ladder. Once I was on the sidewalk, I just started walking. As I walked, I started to relax and feel better about life in general. I walked through our neighborhood, past all the houses, and eventually found myself in one of the parks. Walking to it would probably take you a good two hours, so I guess time had flown by pretty quickly, especially because I didn't really know where I was going. When I got there, I just sat on a swing and thought. If you've ever tried it, it really is a nice thing to do. Just sit and be alone with your thoughts. After a good deal of thinking, I realized that I really wasn't happy when I was with my family. I thought if I could leave them I would be happier. I almost got up and started on my way when I realized that there wasn't that much for me anywhere but home. So I decided to head back. I didn't even look at any road signs; I just kind of let my feet take me back home. I had locked my door so no one could get back in, so when I got back, I heard pounding on my door. Of course, they argue and cause drama and suddenly they wonder why on Earth I would leave to my room. I climbed up the ladder, and when I carefully opened the door, the pounding continued. The voice of the person behind the door was my mother's. When I finally opened the door to let her in, she started to scream at me. Asking why I hadn't answered the door, where was I, I needed to tell them where I was going, and that I missed dinner. Honestly, I wasn't even hungry, so it didn't matter. Finally, I shut the door in her face and locked it again. I laid down on my bed as I heard her threats. \"I'll take away your iPod! I'll not give you breakfast! You better get out here right now!\" She shouted and shouted and finally I just put my ear buds in and turned on my ignore switch. She was still screaming when I drifted off to sleep. The only reason I hadn't said anything to her the whole time wasn't because I was angry, it was because I was too relaxed to care. Just like now. We reached an area where there were two different tunnels. My feet automatically chose a path and I found myself setting my eyes on daylight. There were maybe two or three trees, and there was a little bit of grass growing here and there. The sky was still a bright red, but the heat wasn't as bad. My only question now was where is the food and water? I hadn't realized how tired I was until I found myself collapsing against a rock, my throat dry from lack of water. I saw Portin doing the same not far from me. He reminded me a bit of my brother. I remember one time we went to the zoo and it took us a lot of walking to get where we needed to go. He whined and complained the entire time, and when we got back to the car he sat dramatically down on his seat and let out the most ridiculous sigh I've ever heard. My parents bought him a bottle of water and he gulped the entire thing down in less than a minute. He was 5 at the time, so that was a pretty big accomplishment. When we got home, he was asleep, so my father had to carry him in to the house. I remember it quite well, it was a fond memory to have. Although he looked a whole lot cuter when sleeping then Portin did. His mouth had dropped open and drool was slowly slipping out of it. I turned away from his face in disgust when my eyes found a small round metal plate stuck into the ground. I woke Portin and we went over to it. There was a handle on the top. Perfect. I wrapped my fingers around it and pulled. It gave way, and when I looked down, I saw a relatively long ladder that went down into…something. With no fear of heights, but slight claustrophobia, I told Portin to follow me down into this hole. Who knows? Maybe there's some sort of refugee camp in it. I started to climb down, my hand gripping each wrung as tightly as I could, and slowly becoming short of breath, simply because of how deep underground I was going. When I finally felt my feet touch the ground, I looked around to see capsules that stretched on and on and on. There was a desk, and the person behind it looked at us in shock. \"Can – can I help you?\" he asked, seeming concerned that we were here. I walked over and looked up at him. He was tall, with hazel eyes and dirty blond hair. He had a bit of stubble on his chin, and he wasn't wearing a clean shirt. \"Um, what exactly is this place?\" I inquired. The man replied, \"This is the sleeping bunker. Each person gets on single capsule. All it has is a bed, no place to store things, you'll have to go to the locker building to do that. Do you want to reserve a capsule?\" I thought a bit. \"Sure,\" I told him. He looked over at Portin. \"Him too?\" \"Ya,\" I told him. \"Ok, $108.56.\" he replied. I didn't realize it cost money. But how did anyone have money now? I thought whatever was left of Earth wouldn't include money. I guess it did. Or maybe there was a new currency. \"Excuse me?\" It was all I could get out. \"Miss, it costs one hundred and eight dollars and fifty-six cents to reserve two capsules. Would you like to reserve them?\" His reply seemed a bit irritated. I replied, \"No! I don't have any money. How is there money? Haven't you been outside lately? The entire Earth is gone!\" He looked a bit confused. \"Miss, we know that the atmosphere has been slightly disturbed, but other than that, everything is fine.\" Now I was just getting mad. \"No! You're lying!\" I shouted angrily. \"This woman, she-she told me the world was gone! I don't understand!\" I heard him calling someone and soon I felt a shot inject into my skin, and as it seeped through my veins, I felt reality slowly disappear. When I awoke, I was in the same place as before, but tied to the ground. Great, just as soon as my wrists had started to heal from my captivity earlier, I started to get rope burn. And it was already pretty severe. Instead of being scared, however, I was irritated. I guess I did freak out a little, but it's not enough to tie me up. I saw the same man, with those hazel eyes. He was sitting behind his desk again, and when he finally realized I was awake, he came over. Just as soon as Portin started to wake up too. It was at that point that I was even more irritated before. The man untied us and began to speak. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Sorry about the sleep medication, we just needed you to calm down. Since you've already seen what was outside this bunker, we might as well tell you. Yes, the world is gone. But not in the way that woman told you. The atmosphere has been destroyed by a severe pollution cloud that was created from a factory producing a new kind of plastic. We were promised that it was safe for the environment, but obviously, we'd been lied to. Then when we saw the sky slowly turn red, scientists from a secret organization came out of the shadows and told everyone to bury everything underground. Pretty soon, there won't be any oxygen left and we will suffocate. So we are gathering as much vegetation as possible and storing it underground. That way, we can produce oxygen after we lose it on the surface. We're still working on it, though. A lot of us are worried that there isn't enough time, but I hope there is. Did you know about any of this?\" \"No,\" I replied. \"Do you know about anyone in Florida who survived?\" \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"But Florida is part of the south. Their oxygen went out weeks ago. Florida's gone.\"[Chapter 5] I nearly choked on my own throat. I was stunned. All those memories hurt now. All the times I snuck out of the house because I was sick of my family, I regretted all of them. Suddenly I thought of my brother and sister, them suffocating slowly, gasping for air and trying to survive. My parents wondering where I was, and frantically trying to save the children they still had. I didn't cry, I didn't scream, I didn't feel anything. \"Ok,\" I managed to push out. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I found myself gasping for breath. Maybe it was claustrophobia. No, anxiety. I ran to the ladder and started to climb it. Up and up I went; trying desperately to breathe. Memories flashed into my head, of all the times me and my siblings had snuck food and other things when my parents left, of the birthday parties, and even the arguments. The arguments which I always hated seemed like a good memory to me now. They were all I had left to hold to on to, all that was left of my family. My palms started to get sweaty, and as I soaked the handle bars with them, climbing up got harder and harder. When I got to the top and shoved open the hatch, I realized just how hard I had been panting. I saw Portin coming up after me. I ran and hid behind a tree, hoping he wouldn't see me. When he got up, he started calling my name. Now I felt bad for him, too, so I walked out from behind the tree in which I had hidden behind. That's when I completely lost it. I collapsed into a fit of tears that I couldn't stop. I was sobbing and sobbing, inconsolable even by Portin. I started and choke and then eventually threw up all over the ground, convulsing because my sobs jerked my body so hard. Finally Portin had to get control over me. He grabbed my arm tightly and forced me to stand up. He was surprisingly strong for his small build. He grabbed my other arm and pulled me in towards his face. The shock of this caused my convulsing and tears to stop suddenly. Then he started talking. I guess this was his plan. \"Agraina, listen. You need to pull yourself together. Like, now. I understand you've just lost a lot and it's a big shock, but I need you in your right mind. I don't know where we are or what's going on, so you have got to do this with me. Ok? Can you do that?\" I couldn't say anything, so I just nodded. \"Come here,\" he said, wrapping his arms around me. His embrace felt wonderful, and I found myself crying again, but not as badly. I just let the tears fall silently as he kept whispering \"it's ok, it's ok\" into my ear. Obviously it wasn't, everything I'd ever known was gone, but at least it made me feel better. When I'd finally calmed down, we went back down. After all, we have a lot more questions to ask and I needed answers. More answers about Florida, of course. We made our way back down the ladder, and our hands slowly became sticky from the sweat that had dried from my hands. As we went down, I thought of my house. When you walked in, the kitchen was right there. There was an island, and the counter wrapped around ¾ of the kitchen. There was a breakfast bar in a little nook by the stairs. The stairs weren't very many. There were only two, and they boosted you up to the hall and living room. The hall was on the left, the living room on the right. Down the hall were the bedrooms, and the bathroom. The wall directly to the left of the living room had a staircase that led down to basement, where we spent most of our time in during the summer, since it was so hot. The backyard wasn't very big, because we were very close to other houses. It was big enough for a pool, though, which was nice. I loved it, I always had. But I needed a reality check. I wasn't there anymore, and I certainly wouldn't be for a long time, if ever at all. So I left the memory there. We got to the bottom of the ladder and Portin worked out how we would stay here. We would help them with whatever they needed, and they would give us each a capsule. It seemed like a pretty good deal, especially because we got fed. Evidently there was only one floor, because the air above wasn't too bad and the trap door at the top could seal out air, so if we needed to, we could stop it from polluting the capsules. They weren't very prepared in my opinion, but I suppose I didn't really have much of a say in that. I went over to mine and just laid there. I think I might have started to cry again, and it wouldn't surprise me if I did, but it wasn't the only thing I did. I found myself so deeply lost in thought that at one point, I actually thought I was back home. Then I blinked and found myself once again in the capsule. I suppose I'd thought too hard, because the tears started again and before I knew it I had cried myself to sleep. When I woke up, there were people milling about in the hall, most of climbed up and out and I got Portin and followed them. We talked for a little bit, and I realized I had never asked where he came from. \"Hey Portin,\" I said. \"What state did you live in?\" He hung his head. \"Florida,\" he replied. I was shocked. The whole time, the person who I'd had gone through this whole thing with had coincidentally been in the same state as me the entire time. How ridiculous is that? At the same time I felt bad for him because I knew that meant his state was gone. Why? Because it was the same state as mine. \"I'm sorry,\" I told him. I didn't know what to say to him; I have no idea how he handled my convulsions and endless tears with such a calm attitude. It seemed impossible to me, but I suppose that's because I've never been good with that sort of thing. Whenever someone is sad or angry, I stand awkwardly in the corner until it fades. I just can't handle it. I looked back over at Portin, who wasn't crying, or really that sad in general. Either he was a good actor or he just really wasn't feeling anything. I started to feel a little nervous. I wasn't really sure what about, I just felt nervous. I knew there could have been so many worse things, but this, this was pretty bad. I guess I should have felt nervous. I looked over at Portin again. He seemed so relaxed, like nothing was wrong. Maybe he was in shock like I was when I first heard. But no, he had heard the news at the same time that I had. So what was it? Suddenly I remembered the hospital, when he was coughing and gasping for breath because he couldn't control what he was saying. I had never really asked him about that. Why hadn't I? No time, too many distractions, maybe, but still, I should have mentioned it. What if he was still in this state? And even if he wasn't, why else would he be acting like this? I needed answers, and I needed them quickly. So I decided to go for it. \"Portin, what is wrong with you?\" I blurted out. It did not go as I intended it to. He looked over at me calmly, and almost like a robot, said, \"There isn't anything wrong with me. I'm quite alright.\" Now I was really starting to panic. \"Are you sure about that?\" I asked. \"Don't you remember the hospital; you were gasping for breath and begging me to help you?\" He looked at me once more, and then he let out a laugh. \"Wake up, Agraina, that never happened,\" was all he told me. Wake up, Agraina. What's that supposed to mean? I tried to shrug it off, but it wasn't an easy thing to do. The memories were so clear, so vivid that I couldn't have just dreamt it! \"You're lying!\" I screamed. \"You're just lying! What is taking over you that is making you like this! It's not fair! Just stop it!\" At that point I had resorted to punching and scratching him, not even realizing that he was no longer breathing. I suppose I was so caught up in the fact that I hated him at that moment that I couldn't focus on anything else. By the time I had realized what was going on, Portin's heart had stopped. He was dead.[Chapter 6] I don't know what helped me stay sane without Portin, but somehow, I managed to calmly bring him back down to the capsule hotel. According to man who owned it, they took the idea off of a hotel in Tokyo. Since Tokyo was such a crowded city, there was a hotel there with capsules in it. Each person would get a capsule and that's what they would stay in. It really was a neat idea, so they decided to replicate it underground. It wasn't really that nice, but when you have nothing left, it's definitely somewhere to go. As I laid Portin down on the ground, showing him to the man at the desk, I saw the look on his face. He was so concerned; you'd think he was really close to Portin. \"What happened?\" he asked quietly. I felt a tear run down my cheek. \"It was my fault,\" I managed to choke out. \"I think something was wrong with him, and I got angry at him. I thought he was lying to me. But I don't think he was and - and now he's dead!\" \"Don't worry,\" the man said. \"He'll be fine. After all he…\" his voice trailed off as he started to fade away completely. With him, the room faded. Everything around me started to fade until I found myself on the ground again. The tunnel was still there, I remembered walking through it just a day ago with Portin where we'd found the capsule hotel. But the trees and the grass were gone. I ran frantically, trying to find a way to bring him back. But I couldn't. There was no bringing him back. But why on Earth did everything fade once Portin died? I never did hear the name of the man who owned it. Now I wish I had. Maybe I could have gotten more answers. \"It's all my fault! It's all my fault!\" I screamed over and over, thinking maybe if I could have controlled myself, none of this would have happened. But it already did. No changing it, no redoing it, it was done. I suppose I had been speaking out loud because the voice of someone else startled me. \"No redoing it, huh? Well that doesn't sound very optimistic, now does it?\" the voice was that of a man's. I turned around and instantly knew that I didn't recognize this man. \"Who are you?\" I demanded. \"Where did you come from?\" \"Good question,\" he replied. \"What are your opinions on time travel?\" I looked at him quizzically. \"It's not real,\" I told him. \"Fact or opinion?\" he asked. \"Fact,\" I replied. \"No,\" he said. \"Opinion. Time travel has not only been possible in dreams for a long time, but it has been possibly in reality for a while as well. What you have just seen is an example of time travel.\" I was really confused now. \"What do mean, an example? Why did that man disappear? People don't just do that!\" \"Ah,\" he replied. \"That's where you definitely got it! People don't just disappear. But think about it. If you were to travel back and cross your own timeline, but the younger you died while you were visiting, what would happen?\" \"You would…fade,\" I said, not quite realizing that the owner of the capsule hotel was Portin, just his future self. As the shock settled over my face, the man laughed. This time I would be sure to get names. So I decided to ask him. \"Oh my name? I'm Professor Jordan, of the Institute Involving Time Travel. We call it I.T. Squared for short. We've been working on hundreds of different ways to travel through time. We've developed quite a few, including travel by wire, by ship, and over three thousand ways through being unconscious. If you want to go back and undo the wrong you made, now is the time.\" Everything he said actually made quite a bit of sense, so I decided that maybe I would follow him. But how could I trust him? Honestly, I couldn't. Either way, even though I've always been extremely skeptical about time travel and relatively any type of science fiction, there was something about time travel that enticed me, especially because it meant that I might be able to see Portin again. So I decided to follow him. He walked up to a certain spot in the barren wasteland that was once a meadow, and motioned for me to join him. \"Now,\" he began to explain, \"What is going to happen is you are going to stand in this very spot, and I will activate a teleportation that will bring you to where you need to go. Are you ready?\" I waited a moment, butterflies in my stomach. Then I decided. Again. Officially. \"Yes, I'm ready,\" I replied steadily. Suddenly I felt my whole body being pulled around and when I opened my eyes, I was in a building that seemed strangely familiar. Then I looked down a hallway. It was the shape shifting building. I was back in that God forsaken building. I was interrupted by Professor Jordan. \"I have a question for you,\" he said calmly. \"Did the man who faded ever touch your friend?\" \"Depends on your definition of touching,\" I retorted. With a short laugh, he got to the explanation. \"Well you see, touching your future or past self can create a paradox, or wound in time. When that paradox is created, you or other parts in your timeline can be corrupted or destroyed completely. If there was never any contact between Portin and well- possibly also Portin, that means that they are indeed the same person.\" It took a little bit of thought to process this. It kind of reminded me of a time in history class where there was a big argument over time travel. One of the kids argued that there was no possible way time travel could be real. The other kid said that there was easily hundreds of ways it was real. Of course each person ended up taking a side and I think we spent the rest of our school day arguing over it. Of course I took the logical side of things, I just usually did. The teacher cut in and told us that although it may one day be possible, right now time travel is way out of our league. I didn't agree with him totally, but it ended the argument, so we were all satisfied at least. If both the people in the capsule hotel were Portin, what could that mean for me? I understood the concept well enough, but I didn't understand another thing; they didn't exactly look alike. Maybe he changed as he grew older, but if he did, I don't think I'd be happy about it. Although what I think doesn't exactly matter, does it? I suppose I would find out. My thoughts were interrupted by Professor Jordan. \"You alright, Agraina? I know it's a lot to take in,\" he said. \"Fine,\" I replied. \"A little confused, though.\" He looked over calmly. \"I know, I know, just wait. We will need to hook you up to one of our machines. We'll send you back to where you need to go. Remember, you've only got one chance. One chance, and that's it.\" I took a deep breath. \"Okay,\" I said, failing miserably to sound calm. I walked behind Professor Jordan; through the halls that seemed to never end. I looked at the locked doors and remembered that once upon a time I was behind one of them. I remembered how it felt, the pain and the blood, how I shook and shook in fear, waiting for reality to leave; waiting to die. I wondered if there were still people there, if they were still being tortured, still being forced to fight. I thought of the boys I saw, beating each other until one of them was dead or gave up. But what I didn't understand was how the Professor could walk past these halls calmly, without thinking of any of this. It was like he simply didn't care or notice the fact that behind each door was someone who was slowly starving, slowly dying. Or maybe he did notice. Maybe he could mask his feelings, keep them hidden away from those around him. I suppose I wasn't very good at that, because I saw Jordan stop and walk over to me. \"Are you sure you're alright?\" he seemed to repeat this question a lot. I guess it was because time travel is a very difficult thing to believe in. The thought of jumping on and off at different points in time confused me so much. I've read a couple books about it before, all them being science fiction, but I still didn't get it. I was never really into it anyway, so I guess it didn't matter. Until now, of course. If I didn't understand it, what would I say? Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't understand the thing you've probably spent your entire life fascinated by? I wasn't ready to give him my honest opinion yet, so I just decided to go with the polite reply. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"It's just been a little stressful, what with the world ending and everything.\" He laughed. I suppose I didn't see how that was funny until after I said it. I ended up laughing with him, I guess it was funny after all, wasn't it? I didn't even realize I had a sense of humor up until now, probably because of everything I'd gone through in the past- in the past what? I had no idea how long I'd been in that building, let alone how long I'd been trying to get out. It couldn't be in the past few days, could it have? I suppose it had been about a week since I'd found Portin and gotten out, but that didn't change the fact that time had sort of just slipped away. It's almost like I had gone into a coma, like nothing was quite real. But it was. My mind was going through it right now. How couldn't it be real? I thought of all the times that I had missed Portin, how I felt, what it was like. It wasn't a happy feeling; having to wonder wear in the world he was, despite the fact that there really wasn't much left of the world. I didn't know it then, of course. I thought that there was a whole lot left. I thought my parents, my siblings, everyone, they were still alive. But no. Everyone I'd ever known, they were all gone. I had thought of it before, of course, when I first heard; when Portin was there to comfort me. But now, even he was gone. Maybe not forever, but long enough for me. I needed him back. This was why I needed to get control over myself and take care of this mess. Professor Jordan said I had one chance. I suppose, if I had one chance, I should take it, I should use it for the better. So I did, I walked a few blocks further down the halls, and we stepped into a room. It was relatively large, with some sort of contraption in the middle. It was surrounded by wires and in the center, there was a machine. It had about five pumps, all moving up and down, and each one had a clock on it. The clocks just spun and spun and spun, and as they did, the strange cylinder shape that the pumps surrounded began to swell and then contract. This pattern repeated over and over, and as it did, you could hear voices, like those of a thousand people. I walked over to it, and as I did I felt a hand grip my shoulder. \"I wouldn't go near that while it's turned on,\" rang Jordan's voice. I looked at Jordan, then back at the contraption. \"Is that the… the machine?\" I asked. \"Sure is,\" he replied. \"I developed it myself. What did you expect? Some big spaceship ready to fly through thin air?\" I blushed. \"Well actually, yes,\" I said, trying to sound calm. I suppose he saw the embarrassment on my face, because he started laughing again. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I know what it's like; getting used to all this. I had to once, a long, long time ago. But you'll get used to it eventually, and when you do, make sure you help your friend Portin do the same.\" \"You're sure I'll get him back?\" I asked. \"I know,\" he said. \"I watched it happen.\" My mind tried to process what those words meant. Did he travel back already, just to make sure I do it? That means I have to do it right now, doesn't it? I didn't understand what he'd said at all. Whatever it was, I needed to understand or else I couldn't go through time itself to save someone who had already died. The more I thought about it, the less sense it made. I could just shrug it off, I guess, but what good would that do? There was nothing to be done but ask questions. Finally I forgot my pride and humility and decided to sum up the courage to ask some questions. \"I don't understand,\" I said. \"How did you see it happen? Did you- did you go back?\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"I did. I didn't know who you were back then, and I was travelling around, looking to see what the causes were. I saw you save this boy, Portin from yourself, and when I saw myself watching, I realized I had to help you. So I traveled to a later time and got you. Now do you understand?\" \"A little more,\" I admitted. \"Good,\" he replied. \"I was hoping so. Anyway, we need to get started. We don't have all day- well, we do, but I'm sure you want to get this taken care of, yeah?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, my voice cracking a bit. I missed Portin, I really did, and the sooner I got him back, the better. Only, I wish that it was simpler. And the fact that I'm saving Portin from a mistake that I made… it made me feel bad. I was the cause of his death. I didn't realize that tears were now starting fall on my face. I heard Jordan speak again. \"You alright?\" he asked, again. He seemed to be so concerned about everyone, to the point where it was just a little bit ridiculous. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine,\" I said, trying to sound calm. \"I just- I just really want to get this done.\" I wiped the tears off my cheeks. \"So, can you tell me how this machine works?\" Jordan seemed relieved to have me calmed down a bit. \"Yes, yes of course,\" he said. \"Now, the cylinder in the middle? I call that the platform. You stand on it, and the five pumps around it will pick up speed. As they do, you will start to disappear from the platform. Now remember, you have to set the coordinates, make sure they're precise, you know? If you don't, you could end up not being able to do what you need to do. That's why I'll be putting in the coordinates. I gave them to myself, so I'll know what to put in.\" I was once again very confused. How could he give himself coordinates when he never really knew them in the first place? All my mind could place was an infinite loop of Jordan giving himself the coordinates and then using them so he could give them to himself again and again and again, until… until what? It would never stop. Sure I would save Portin from myself, but what good would that do? I'd keep on saving him in an endless loop, just like Jordan would give himself the coordinates. My mind tried to push the thought out of my head, but it wouldn't leave. Some other part of me wouldn't let it. So I tried to process it again. But now my mind was going in a loop, trying really hard to understand what was going on. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't. Finally I decided to just get this over with. \"Ok, I'm ready. Let's do this,\" I said. Jordan didn't seem worried at all, but despite that, he still questioned my actions. \"You sure?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I replied. \"I'm sure.\" He walked over to the machine and pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. He looked at each clock, and then he turned and walked over to some sort of control panel. After pulling a lever, the clocks stopped spinning and the pumps stopped pumping. He walked back over to the machine and started to set the time on one of the clocks. He then set the next one, and the next one, going on and on until all the clocks were set. After that, he pulled each pump to a certain point, and then he circled the whole machine at least half a dozen times, inspecting each little nook and cranny, looking for a flaw. Adjusting this ever so slightly, changing that, until finally, he stepped back, looked at his work, and smiled. \"Ok,\" he said happily. \"It's ready to go. Just step up on that platform. Now remember, you're going to see yourself, just from the past. Do not touch yourself, because that would cause a paradox. Whatever you do, don't let that happen.\" I took a deep breath, and my legs started to move towards the platform. I pushed myself up onto it, and stood up. I gave Jordan a thumbs up, and he started the machine. I felt my whole body shake and twist, like something was pulling it apart and I closed my eyes. When I opened them, I saw myself. I was screaming at Portin. Just the sight of him made me so happy. I ran towards him, grabbed him by the arm, and pulled him out of the clutches of the insane girl that was once me. After that, I saw her start to cry. I looked over and saw Jordan watching us. I realized that the piece of paper with the coordinates on it was in my pocket. How did it get there? I realized that was for me to decide. I walked over to the past Agraina and cleared my throat. I remember this, now. What she had told me. \"Hey,\" I said. \"I know what you're thinking. It's me; I'm you, from your future. Portin's going to be alright, but it will be a little bit before you see him, ok? You're going to meet someone named Professor Jordan. I want you to give this to him. Can you do that?\" \"Yeah, I can do it,\" she replied. She reached out for the paper, and after she took it, she reached up for my face. I jumped back. \"No!\" I said. \"You can't touch me! I have to go now, ok?\" I ran back over to the platform, but before I could step onto it, everything around me disappeared, and I was in the capsule hotel again, trying to talk to the man who was actually Portin. I still had more questions: how did he get here? Did we really stay that long? Was the problem ever solved? If it took that long for…unless the problem was solved and he went back to see something or solve something here. But what was he here to solve? If we had fixed the problem, what was here to fix? I tried to wrap my head around it, but I couldn't. So maybe if he didn't need to solve something, maybe there was something he needed to see instead. But what would that be? Maybe there was something here that isn't going to be here in the future. Something he wanted to grab, someone he needed to see. And that's when I realized that it was someone. That someone was me. But if he was going back to see me, what happened? Why wasn't I there? Then it hit me. I was going to die. Of course there were many situations where I thought this was going to happen but I never actually thought that I would die. I always thought that somehow, even if I died, I wouldn't. This time, even if I tried to fix it, there was no way if wouldn't happen. I would die, simple as that. Now I was starting to get scared. I guess it was just the fact that I legitimately thought I was going to die, what with everything that was going on. I tried to shrug the thought, but I couldn't. So I decided to ask Portin's future self a couple of questions. I walked over to him and tapped him on the shoulder. \"Hey, can I talk to you?\" I asked. My voice lowered. \"In private?\"[Chapter 7] He looked over at the young version of Portin. Then he turned around. \"Yeah,\" he replied. He showed me to a hallway that led off from the front desk. There were a couple extra rooms through it. I wonder why he didn't tell me about these. They seemed pretty important, because each one had about three locks on it. We walked up to the third one down, where we stopped. Portin pulled out a ring full of keys and opened each lock, one by one. He opened up the door and we went inside. It was a relatively normal room, just like any sort of room that you would see in a hotel. So why were they locked up? I was interrupted by Portin. \"So, what did you want to talk about?\" he asked. \"Well,\" I replied, \"I wanted to know why you're here. I know who you are, you know. You never gave me your name, but I don't need it. You're Portin aren't you?\" \"Yes, I'm him,\" he said. \"Is there anything else you want to know?\" \"Yes, I need to know why you're here,\" I replied. \"Ok, you really want to know? It's because- because I…\" his voice trailed off. I was startled by the hug that I found myself wrapped in. He didn't let go for a while, but when he did, I looked up at him. His eyes, I remembered them so well, from the moment I found to him to the moment that was now. But obviously there was something wrong, because I knew what he was like. He would miss me, oh he would, which meant something was going to happen to me. But was I sure it was going to be death? No, not exactly. Maybe I went missing, maybe I left him, I don't know, but whatever was going to happen, I wanted to make sure that it didn't. \"Agraina?\" Portin spoke up, \"You ok?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" I replied. \"Ok. We should get back to the lobby,\" he said quietly. We walked back to the lobby, silenced by the thought of what we both seemed to know would happen. Or maybe he knew more. Maybe he knew something I didn't, something important. If he did, then maybe I should ask him. I still had so many questions about him, and why I wasn't there. I didn't know what I'd do just yet, but I intended to find out more about this whole ordeal. We got out of the hallway and I reunited with Portin. \"What was that all about?\" He asked quizzically. I looked over at future Portin. \"Nothing, just nothing,\" I replied. \"Ok,\" he said. He seemed a bit worried. I don't blame him; I wasn't exactly acting right, now was I? I wasn't telling him, while his future self told me at least something. I was kind of terrible. I suppose my actions might have been based somewhat on protecting Portin, but mostly, like always, it was for selfish reasons. I wanted to know what was going on before he did. That's always how I worked; I did everything for myself and myself only. I decided that maybe I should tell Portin what was really going on. But not today, not now. I needed to figure out what was going on- exactly what was going on- and fast. If I didn't, God knows what would happen. If I didn't know better, though, I'd say that there was even more to the story. Obviously whatever chemical, or whatever it was that \"ended the world\" was pretty serious. But the world is still here. A lot of people died, but it's still here. I always imagined that if the world ended, there would probably be tectonic plates ripping apart, things crashing and burning, everyone running in terror, trying to find something to hold on to, and being unable to due to the fact that the world was vanishing. But what I didn't realize is the world wouldn't end screaming. It would quietly and calmly, and even though the planet was still there, the people in it would be gone. I didn't realize just how much worse that sounded. It's like a ship going down without its captain, like everyone abandoned it. It just felt…wrong. Like no one even cared, and if they did, they were already dead. I didn't like that thought one bit. So I decided that I was going to do something about it. I didn't know what, like many cases before, but I would still do something. I decided I should probably get Portin to go off somewhere else, do something, so I could dig deeper into this case; I just wasn't sure what I was going to do. Maybe I'd do some research. But with what? There were no computers, no Wi-Fi, no libraries or books, I would just have to ask people questions. If I could find Jordan again, maybe he'd be able to help me. If he could travel back in time to where it all started, maybe we would know a little more. But that would mean going back into the building, and I wasn't exactly sure if I wanted to do that. Still, it was my best shot, considering there really wasn't any other way to get information. So I went over to Portin and tried to convince him to go back in the hotel. \"I'm not going back in there!\" he screamed. \"I don't know where you're going!\" \"It's ok Portin, I'll be back soon,\" I replied, trying to sound calm. He was angry about it, but he finally relented. I walked him in, and then climbed out of the ladder and back onto the surface. I looked for the tunnel, and when I found it, started walking through it again. I forgot just how deep the tunnels went, because I found myself a little claustrophobic as I pushed myself to keep walking, when it felt as if the walls and ceiling could cave in at any given moment. I started to run, thinking maybe if I didn't, I'd be dead. But the ceiling, the walls, they didn't cave in; they just stayed. When I finally made it out, I looked over and to my horror there it was; the building. The shape-shifting building. This time, it was relatively large. It was white, with a lot of windows and a lot of doors. It sort of looked like a big motel, only it wasn't. It had a sign above the main entrance that read Institute Involving Time Travel on it. I decided that maybe it'd be worth a shot to just go in. I thought about for a moment, though. What if it wasn't the institute? What if I got taken again? I looked down at the scars on my wrist, remembering just how hard it really was to push through everything that was in my way. Just how much more trauma would I go through if I walked through those doors now and saw that everything was a lie. I couldn't do it, but I had to. So I took a deep breath and started walking toward the door. I felt my hand reach out for the knob, and grab it. Then, I twisted my wrist, and before I knew it, I was in the lobby, looking around. The few survivors in the area seemed to live here, or they were planning on it. People sat in chairs with luggage next to them, while others were up at the front desk, talking to a clerk or waiting in line. It seemed more like a college or a hotel than an institute. Still, there were halls with different research facilities held within them. A few of them had to do with different machines; others were how to set coordinates on clocks, there were many others, but one had specifically caught my eye. It was one single room, no label above the door, but it stuck out to me. I found myself walking towards it, only to be interrupted by one of the clerks. \"Excuse me, but you can't go in there,\" he said, a lot of authority in his voice. \"What's in that room anyway?\" I asked. \"We can't let you in there is all that matters,\" he said, now sounding more annoyed than ever. \"Well if I can't go in there I'd least like to know why,\" I retorted. I suppose I was pushing my luck, because he picked up the phone and started dialing. \"Hello?\" he said. \"Professor? Yeah, I'm going to need you downstairs, we've run into a bit of a problem.\" He looked up at me and glared. I sat down on one of the chairs, now getting several angry glances from some of the other customers. Is that what they were? Customers? Or maybe they were students, maybe they worked here. Whatever they were doing here, I didn't like the way they looked at me. Their faces seemed so judging, so cruel; it was almost like they knew who I was and what I did. My thought cleared when I heard the sound of footsteps behind me. \"Hello, my name is Professor Jordan,\" the voice behind me rang out. \"I'm from the Institute Involving Time Travel.\"[Chapter 8] I whirled around, just barely stopping myself from sending a punch directly in his face. Instead only a few words came tumbling out. \"Um…Hi,\" I gasped. \"Hello. Can I ask what your name is?\" he inquired calmly. \"Agraina Loftkin,\" I replied, trying desperately to calm down. \"Hello, Agraina, how are you?\" he asked. He sounded so much calmer than me. \"Um, I'm alright. Don't you remember me?\" I asked. \"Remember you?\" he said, sounding confused. \"Why would I? We've never met.\" When he said this, I lost all the calm I had. That's when I went running through the halls, knocking things away as I went. I had gone insane in that moment: I had no idea what it was that had come over me, but as I ran, taking things and smashing them, I felt hands grip my upper arms and suddenly reality disappeared and I was asleep. When I woke up, I was strapped to a bed, unable to move. I looked around, and as I did I realized that this place was a lot more like a hospital than anything else. There was nothing plugged into me, and with a small raise of my head I knew I was alone, but still, I was nervous. I looked out the window that led to the halls. There was a sign that read Mentally Ill on it. Mentally ill? I suppose my rampage earlier had to do with that, but I was still angry. I wasn't always mentally ill, and I certainly wasn't now. I was just misunderstood. I wanted to get out of this place, and quickly. I started to scream for someone to let me out, not realizing that it wouldn't help with my current situation. Someone rushed in and injected me with another shot of whatever it was that had caused me to go to sleep before. When I was asleep, I started dreaming. Dreaming of life before all this, back when things were normal, and right. My mom was making breakfast, while my older sister helped. I was on my laptop. \"You should get off that thing and start helping us,\" she said. I gave an exasperated sigh and looked back at my screen. Suddenly my sister's face changed into a monsters and she grabbed my laptop, picked it up and smashed it on the ground. I woke up a sweaty, screaming mess. Some woman ran in and asked me what was wrong. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"Nothing, it was just a dream.\" I was still trying to catch my breath. With a short nod, she left the room. I was alone again. I didn't know how long, there were no clocks in the room and I sort of drifted in and out sleep, but when I finally heard footsteps, I was surprised to see that it was Jordan who walked in. \"Hey, how are you?\" he asked quietly. \"Feeling a little bit better,\" I replied. \"Do you really not know who I am?\" \"Well,\" he said calmly, \"When it comes to time travel, lots of things happen out of order. I may not know you yet, but a future version of me will. I met you just now, and I will meet you again. It's just how things work, Agraina.\" I nodded, trying to make more possible sense of what he had just said. I understood that things can happen out of order well enough, I just didn't understand how or why it had to happen to me. I mean, the more I thought about it, the less sense it made. I tried to think of how this might affect me positively, but I couldn't think of one possible way. I didn't understand how everything could just go to hell that quickly, but it did. My life had fallen apart. Of course, it had never been exactly right; my youngest sister killed herself as soon as she knew what killing meant. Our family was never what you'd call functional, and as for me, well, I wasn't exactly happy with myself either. Every teenage girl is self-conscious about things, some more than others, but I was so self-conscious it was unreal. Any negative remark about my appearance, sarcastic or serious, would drop my mood to an all time low instantly. My mother tried to get me in therapy, but it didn't work. I just sat numb in the chair, not listening to anything the therapist said. My mother then cancelled the sessions, explaining they were a waste of money and they weren't doing me any good. She was right, of course, but that didn't change the fact that she had tried it in the first place. Why therapy? I honestly didn't see how it would help my situation. Was over self-consciousness that big of a problem? I had always been weakened by it; at school, at church, at home, no matter where I was, I always seemed to be worried about the way I looked and the way everyone else thought I looked. It wasn't like there was anything I could do about it; it was extremely hard for me to just stop caring. I suppose that was why my mom thought therapy would work. All in all, it was a good theory. But, obviously, it was proven wrong. We tried a lot of things, really, we did, but there wasn't very much to try, so everything got zapped away pretty quickly. It turned out the whole time it was a passing thing; after I turned fourteen it just sort of faded. This was fine by me, of course. But once I got over it, I wasn't the same; it was like I went from having too many emotions to having none at all. I got used to it after a while, but it was weird. About four months after my self-consciousness left, I was taken… wait a minute. Four months after my self-consciousness faded, I was taken. What did that mean? I honestly had no idea, but maybe there was a connection. I didn't see quite where yet, but maybe one day I would. Until then, I had other things to do. \"Can I go now?\" I asked Jordan. \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Let's wait a little bit before we do that. You can get off the bed, though.\" He undid the straps and I could stand up again. I stretched, and looked around. I started to walk down the hallway, the floor cold against my bare feet. The halls were clean, and they smelled like a hospital's. That bandage and fluid smell that they all have, it was there. I looked in at one of the rooms and saw some people in white coats messing around with pumps and machinery. They glanced up at me, only for a second, and continued on with their work. I wondered what it would be like to work here at the end of everything. How much everyone would depend on me. Of course, that depended on how important the job was. If I was like Jordan, I could do so much, I'd be responsible and calm, and everyone would look up to me. But, unfortunately, I wasn't him, I was me; and the only thing I could do was push through what was happening now. I went through a couple more halls until I reached the lobby again. Some of the people were still there, while others were on their way into various different rooms. They were lead in by some of the people that worked there. The others, the ones that stayed seemed very bored and irritated, like they'd been waiting a very long time. I had been in that room for a while; it seemed strange that they would still be waiting there. And what exactly for? I saw those people walk through those doors, but why? What were they doing in there? Suddenly a memory flashed through my mind. I remembered in that moment, that I wasn't taken, I was led. Just like the people being led in now. I remembered my suitcase, packed and ready to go as I walked through those exact doors and was led to a room where they attacked me. They put a cloth full of some sort of drug against my face, and I blacked out. I remembered waking up to being tied to a chair. They tortured me for hours, never letting me do anything but scream. How did I forget this? It was like someone created an artificial memory and burned it into my mind. Someone really smart, who knew a lot about the mind and things similar to it…my thoughts froze at the sound of Professor Jordan's voice. \"Well, well, well, you're up and about I see,\" he said. I could smell the anger in his voice, like he knew what I was thinking. Did he? \"You're wondering if I'm monitoring your mind,\" he said calmly. \"The answer is, yes, I am. I thought that maybe saving your friend would help you trust me more, but just in case, I got a connection to your brain tissue. It didn't really hurt, just a few injections that knock you out so I could really get to work on your brain. Remarkable things, brains, they're just like machines, only more…emotional. I've always loved looking at them, but yours was a bit different. Yours was full of untouched memories, all over the place. It was almost as if someone had put up a memory barrier in your brain. But I wouldn't know about any of that, would I?\" \"Shut up! Just shut up!\" I screamed. Some of the people looked at me strangely. Jordan looked over at them and smirked. \"Ok, guys. You can all go in. Right through those doors, ok? A representative will be with you shortly,\" his voice rang out calmly through the doors. My first instinct was to warn them. I wanted to scream at them, make them listen, but I just couldn't. So I kept quiet as they were marched into those doors. I remembered it, when I had been walked through; tortured and broken to bits. And it wasn't just physically, but mentally. My soul had been ripped to shreds, and I hadn't even remembered. I suppose it had been Jordan, too, who had done all of it, but if it wasn't I would be very concerned. \"Why did you block those memories?\" I asked him. \"To protect you, of course,\" he replied calmly. I hated his attitude; it was like he just didn't care. \"Ok,\" I said, ready to fight back, \"If you wanted to protect me so bad, how come you were the one who issued all of that?\" He laughed. \"Oh, I didn't do that, Agraina. But I can tell you who did.\" \"Well then who?!\" I screamed. \"Hold on, hold on,\" he said. \"I said I could tell you. I didn't say I would .\" \"Well then you better tell me,\" I said, \"Or- \"Or what?\" he retorted. \"I can read everything you're thinking. Do you really think you can do anything to harm me?\" \"I can try,\" I replied smartly. Once more, he laughed. \"Well,\" he said, \"You can tell that to the tranquilizer.\" \"The-the…\" I never finished my sentence because I felt myself drifting off to sleep. I couldn't even begin to count the number of times I had been on and off unconscious since this whole thing began, but all I knew was that it was a lot. Awaking from that state over and over was starting to wear away my strength. Slowly, but surely, I was weakening. I could feel it, all of the energy that I once had just fading away. So this time, when I awoke, I could barely move my fingers. I tried to lift my arm up, but even when I used all my strength, I couldn't do it. With a lot of effort, I managed to turn my head to the other side, and I saw Jordan handing some papers over to one of the workers. I closed my eyes again, hoping he'd think I was still asleep. I think it worked; because he just had someone carry me into another room. I waited there, for a long time, hoping someone would come and do something to break through the deafening silence in the room. I heard muffled noises outside, carts being pushed around; small beeps from machines, and voices. I could never quite understand what they were saying, because they were very muffled, but I knew they were voices. Despite my want it to happen, no one came in. I stayed there for what felt like years; maybe it was only a few hours, but it felt longer. I just laid there, waiting and waiting. I wondered if Portin was looking for me, if maybe he somehow got sent back into the halls. Or back into the rooms, those horrible places where we waited for hours. Maybe we did wait for years there, I honestly wish I could figure out what year it was so I could find out how old I was. I wondered why I hadn't asked before. After all, there were plenty of people, even Jordan, who could have answered that question for me. I decided to try and get up, maybe ask somebody. I made an effort to lift my legs off the bed, and much to my surprise, they slid off and onto the floor in one perfect motion. I could move again, thank goodness. I stood up, and after wobbling a little bit, I started to walk towards the door. It was open, and nothing happened to me as I passed through the doorway, so I figured it was fine. I went up to one of the workers and tapped her on the shoulder. I spoke up as she turned around. \"Hey, weird question. What year is it?\" I asked as I rubbed my eyes. The woman laughed. \"It's 2034, dear,\" she said softly. \"Oh,\" I said, disappointed. \"2034. Thanks.\" I walked away. 2034. I would be 21. 21 years old, and this whole time I thought I was a teenager. I wondered how old everyone else was, if they had been here long or not. I realized I didn't know how long I'd been here; maybe I was a teenager when I came and now I was 21. Or maybe I had been an adult this entire time. I didn't know for sure, so I decided maybe I'd ask someone if they knew how long this has been going on. There was another employee over by a doorway to someone's room. I thought maybe he'd know, so I went up to him and cleared my throat. \"Excuse me sir, but could you tell me how long this whole-um-apocalypse thing has been going on?\" I asked as politely as I could. He smiled. I wasn't sure if he was being friendly or not, until I realized I lost his attention and he decided not to reply to me. I tapped his shoulder as nicely as I could. \"Excuse me sir, I um-I asked you how long this has been going on, I was just wondering if you…\" \"No,\" he replied. \"No I don't. Ask someone else.\" I shrugged and walked away. I wondered what was up with him. I mean, obviously there was something he wasn't telling me, but I had no idea what, so I figured I'd just leave it alone. It was the first time in a long time that I had done that. I remember that as a child it was hard to let anything go. I always seemed to dig and dig and dig until I found the answer to something. It was never a good thing; and I was just so stubborn, it was really quite ridiculous. I never ever wanted to leave a question unanswered; not when I had the chance to answer it. So now, I was just walking away. It was strange, not knowing the answer. Maybe he had been traumatized by something that happened when it started. Lost someone, done something he shouldn't have. We've all been there, I've done both and gotten the t-shirt. I knew what it was like, so I could just ask someone else, like he said. I looked around the room to see if there was anyone else I could ask. That's when I spotted somebody who looked a little disappointed. \"Hey,\" I said after I had walked up to him. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine, just a little annoyed,\" he said quietly. \"Oh,\" I said, wondering what he meant. \"Annoyed with-what, exactly?\" \"Well,\" he said, lowering his voice further. \"The Professor-well he isn't letting me go any further with my experiment. I wanted to figure out how to make a portable time machine, as in microscopic portable. I was so close, I thought I could change so much around the institute, but then Jordan threatened me.\" \"He did what?\" I asked. \"He said I could lose my job if I didn't stand down,\" he said sadly. \"Oh, well that sucks,\" I said. \"When did he tell you this?\" \"About seven years ago,\" he said. \"Around the time when it all started.\" And there it was. My answer. I had finally gotten my answer. But seven years, that's a long time. I thought about how long it had really been. I was fourteen when they took me. It had been a while, obviously, and I had been here way longer than I thought. Which meant everyone else here had probably been here for quite some time, too. After all, if they hadn't where could they be before they got here? I thought maybe if I asked around, someone else could give me the answers I needed. But as I tried talking to more people, they talked less. Finally, I decided I had the big answer that I needed, and I didn't need to do anymore. But as I was wondering aimlessly around the lobby, I saw Jordan in the corner of my eye. \"Hello, Agraina,\" he said with a stingy edge. I whirled around to look at him, when I saw the smirk on his face. What was he so happy about? I wanted to know, because unlike the worker who wouldn't answer my question, this couldn't wait. \"You seem happy,\" I replied, trying to sound calm. \"You've been asking around,\" he said. \"What's it to you?\" I said, my voice starting to shake. \"Well, your mind isn't the only one that I've been monitoring,\" he said eerily. \"You see, I don't exactly trust all my employees. Their brains are important to me too. So, when you ask them about their problems and they tell you? Well they're not exactly telling you the whole truth. They weren't telling me, either. And as you may know, I wasn't exactly happy about that. The things that went through their mind as they explained their problems to you, they were very treasonous things. I don't appreciate that, you see. So, basically, what it is to me, well, it's like this: everyone you just talked to is dead. Have a nice day.\" He ran off quickly, and just as I was about to run after him, I felt a hand grab my arm. \"No, don't go after him,\" The voice behind me said. I turned around to see the guys I had just been talking with before Jordan interrupted me. \"You're still here,\" I said, surprised at his presence. \"Of course I am,\" he replied. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" \"He said you'd all…never mind,\" I said, dismissing the matter with a wave of my hand. \"What?\" he asked persistently. \"Nothing, I said never mind, conversation over; it's not important,\" I said. I was started to get irritated. Yes, I knew I should have said anything about what Jordan told me, but I didn't finish saying it. I guess that's what made it worse. Couldn't he just leave it alone? Of course it was hypocritical for me to expect that from him; especially when I always pushed people when they didn't tell me the whole truth. Still, I didn't want to tell him he was supposed to be dead. That's not something anyone would want to know. Still, maybe he deserved to know it. I mean, if someone knew that I was going to die, I'm pretty sure I'd want to know too. But I barely knew this guy, and there were bigger things going on here. So despite the fact that he followed me and continually asked the same question over and over, I kept walking. That was. Until I remembered what he told me. \"Why did you tell me not to go after Jordan?\" I said after I whirled around to glare at him. \"Because you could end up killed!\" he replied angrily. The words stung in my ears as I thought of what Jordan said. Everyone you just talked to is dead. Why didn't he kill this guy? He said worse things than anyone else did! He was the one who got everything clicking in my brain. Or maybe that's why he wasn't the one to die. There could literally be a million reasons why I shouldn't trust him; and just as many reasons why I shouldn't. But how was I supposed to know what to do? This was far too frustrating. Was it a trick? A trap? Something I shouldn't even worry about? But after everything that happened, I should probably worry about it. I looked up to see he was still standing there, just staring at me with an emotionless stare. \"What's your name, anyway?\" I asked sharply. \"And why are staring at me like that? You're really creeping me out!\" He looked at me for a while, and I looked back; that is, until I became unable to hold his stare. As I looked down, he finally replied. \"My name is Pio,\" he replied. \"And I'm not staring at you.\" I only scoffed at his flat out lie. It made me really start to think that he was working with Jordan. There was no doubt about it; he more than likely was being paid to do it as well. Double crossing, a jerk, cruel, all of those were words that described him. Why on Earth would anyone want to work with someone like Jordan? ","Summary":" It was dark.

He alwaysnslouched, rarely talked with others, and seemed afraid of even thenslightest attempt at conversation. Although, she could not blame himnfor being so fearful. Whenever anyone spoke with him, they alwaysnripped another chunk out of him. Even-no, especially their bossntormented the poor fellow. Shenwished she could help him, but what could she do? There was no onento tell, no one to call for help. \" Inguess there's only one thing to do. I'll befriend him, and perhaps,nthat will start a wheel in motion, and others will do the same. Now,nI just need a reason to go up to him...\" Thenvery next day, she was given that reason as the black-haired mannslowly walked into the office in which six people worked. His armsnwere full of papers, and his head was down as usual. She saw Nathannget up out of the corner of her eye, a wicked grin pulling at hisnmouth. As he and the man walked past each other, he stuck out hisnelbow, scattering the papers across the floor. Biting back a laugh,nNathan kept walking, leaving the man to silently gather his work. \"Now's my chance.\" Quietly,nshe stood from her seat and strided over to the kneeling man. Henglanced up at her before returning his gaze to the floor. Feelingnher co-workers' eyes on her back, she kneeled before him and beganngathering what papers she could. Surprised, the man's head shot up,nhis blue eyes studying her. \"Here you go,\" she said, smiling andnhanding the papers to him. He gingerly took them, still shocked atnher kindness. \"Um, forgive me for asking, but what's your name?\" \"Uh,nWillard, and you?\" \"Alice.n Alice Daniels.\" He nodded his head quickly and smiled at her,nsaying, \"Thank you, Alice.\" \"Oh,nno problem, Willard.\" They then stood and walked to theirnrespective desks, each of them feeling a bit warmer and not quite sonalone.[Chapter 2] The Next Week... The following week,nWillard was late every day, and on that Friday, he didn't even shownup. As a result, rumors sprouted. Some were mild, but others rannalong the lines of, \"Rat-boy finally cracked and did himself in,njust like his old man.\" Concerned, Alice approached hernco-workers, asking for Willard's address. Each time, they refused tontell her, and retorted with lines such as, \"Shouldn't you know? nYou are sleeping with him.\" She wasn't, of course. She wasnjust concerned for a fellow human being, a friend. At least, that'snwhat she kept telling herself. \"We never truly agreed we werenfriends, but still... I helped him, he helped me. I mean, I shouldnat least care that my co-worker is acting so odd, right?\" Finally, she convinced the secretary to tell her; the woman wasn'tnthat bad, actually. And so, here she was,nwalking along a darkening street at six at night, heading for thenaddress she had scribbled down. \"I wonder what I should say.... Inguess I'll just tell him outright why I'm here.\" She turned ancorner, and almost fell down in shock. Before her loomed a rathernlarge house; it was not the fanciest house around, but it was stillnimpressive to someone who had lived in an apartment for eight years. nFinally working up her courage, her footsteps echoed as she walked upnthe stairs to his doorway. She gingerly knocked on the door threentimes and waited. After a minute or two, the door opened. In thendoorway stood Willard, dressed in a t-shirt and blue jeans. His facenwas flushed, and his eyes were red, as if he had been crying. n\"Alice...? What are you doing here?\" Pulled from hernthoughts on his appearance, she said, \"Oh, I thought somethingnmight be wrong, what with your lateness to work and then not evenncoming today.\" His eyes widened and he nodded. \"Oh, I'm fine. It'snjust that my mother's been sick...\" Following that note, theynstood there in an awkward silence, until Alice spoke. \"Well, do you neednhelp with her? My mother was sick for years before finally... So,nanyway, I can help!\" He shook his head. \"No, I can handlenit.\" \"Are you sure,nWillard?\" \"Yes, I-\" Suddenly, someone innthe house shouted, \"Willard! Get back in here and help me find mynpills! Tell whoever that is to wait in the living room until you'rendone with me !\" \"That must be his mother…\" \"Are you sure youndon't want to leave now?\" he asked Alice, beginning to turn andnenter the house. She nodded and followed him inside. \"Wow,nthis place is so pretty…\" Alice thought, marveling at itsnsize as she passed through threshold. He motioned towards a door tonthe left of the front door. \"The living room is right throughnthere.\" \"Willard!!\" He flinched and said,n\"I'll be back to talk as soon as I can,\" before racing throughna door across from the front door. Alice took one more look aroundnthe hallway before entering the living room. Her jaw dropped. nBefore her was large fireplace faced by a couch and two armchairs,nand to her right was a long, metal staircase that wound around like anspring and disappeared upstairs. \"This guy's loaded! Or atnleast his mother is. Aw, but why should I care if he has money? nRemember what your mother taught you before she began hating you,n'Judge someone by their personality, not their looks or things, nonmatter how big they are'.\" She chuckled at that last line. Alice sat down on thencouch and glanced at her watch. \"6:18. Aw, I'm gonna missnDeal or No Deal! Oh, well, I suck at that game anyway…\" Shenstretched her arms and laid back, snuggling against the couch andnwatching the roaring blaze in the fireplace. \"Ah, he'llnprobably only be like ten minutes.\" She closed her eyesnand, after awhile, drifted off into sleep. Later… \" Huh?\" Alice sat bolt upright. \"I was…? How long?\" Shenlooked at her watch. \"8:20? What the heck? Why'd he let mensleep so long? At his house?\" She lookednaround, confused. Nothing looked different. No lights were off, nonsmells of dinner wafted through the house. She tapped her watch,nthinking it to be broken. \"Sorry about that,\"nsaid Willard, suddenly walking into the room and sitting in one ofnthe armchairs. \"Usually, she's in bed by seven. Today, however,nshe didn't seem to want to sleep.\" She blinked in disbelief. Itnreally was eight o' clock? \"I'll understand if you want tonleave now that it's so late.\" She shook her head. \"No, I can stay. Itnis Friday after all.\" A smile crossed his face. \"You're certainlynwelcome here as long as you like. Oh and would you mind handing menthat book?\" he asked, motioning towards a paperback book furtherndown on the couch she was on. She nodded and picked it up beforenstanding and stepping towards him. Her foot hit something on thenway, however, causing her to fall against Willard. His armsninstinctively curled around her. Blushing, she shifted her legs to anmore comfortable position. Wondering why his face turned a darkerncrimson, she looked down and gasped, realizing that she was nownstraddling his lap. Stammering an apology, she tried to push herselfnoff of him, her eyes widening as her hand brushed something hard. \"That's not a pencil, is it?\" \"You little whore!\"ncame a shout from behind Alice. She turned towards the voice andnmentally gasped. There stood an elderly woman in a nightgown; hernface furious, her hands balled into fists. \"A bastard and a whore,nprocreating in my own house! Out with you, bitch! Get out!\" nAlice whimpered and leapt off of Willard, racing for the front doornas fast as she could. Tears streamed down her face as she raced intonthe cold night and collapsed just around the corner in an alley. Shencurled up into a fetal position, sobbing as her mind raced. \"Indidn't! We didn't! God, I've never been so! And poornWillard! Oh, what have I done?\" Finding the energy tonstand, she staggered back to her apartment, desperately wishing shencould just disappear.[Chapter 3] The FollowingnMonday… Alice was at her desknwhen Willard entered the office, late again. He didn't even looknat her. He just sat at his desk and got to work. She tried not tonlook at him. She distracted herself with her pencil, the clock, hernwatch, even the other workers, but eventually, her eyes came to restnon him . \"Oh, God….\" His right cheek was marked withnthree long scratches. They had not been there when she had left hisnhouse. She definitely would have noticed. \"His mother mustnhave really been upset… I should apologize. No! I can't… Henprobably hates me…\" Silently, she stood andnwalked out into the hallway, hoping everyone would assume she wasngoing to the bathroom. She almost made it to the bathroom, actually,nbefore collapsing and going into a crying fit. She balled her handninto a fist and bit down on it, stifling her sobs. Her bodyntrembled, and her mind raced with negative thoughts blaming her fornevery bit of misfortune she had run into during her life. \"Whyndo I only remember bad things? Why never good?\" She bit downnharder. \"Perhaps it's because I have no good things tonremember…\" \"Alice…?\" Shendid not look up. Instead, she burrowed her head into her knees,nwilling herself to disappear. A hand touched her shoulder and shensensed the warmnth of someone sitting beside her. \"Alice, I'm sonsorry about my mother's words the other day.\" She looked atnWillard, who wrapped his arm around her shoulders. She instinctivelynleaned against him. He continued, \"My mother's illness justnmakes her act irrational at times. She didn't mean it.\" \"I'm sorry,nWillard. I shouldn't have come.\" She looked away from him. n\"You didn't even want me there…\" His eyes widened and hensaid, \"Of course I wanted you there! You're my…\" he trailednoff, unsure if he should continue. \"Yes?\" she asked,nlooking at him. \"You're the closestnthing I've had to a friend in…well, forever.\" \"No, I'm not.\" nHe turned towards her, shocked. \"You're not?!\" nShe placed her hand on his, smiling. \"No, I am yournfriend. And you are mine. See how that works?\" He nodded and letnhis head rest against hers. \"For once, I do.\"[Chapter 4] Alice's eyes widened asnWillard's lips covered hers. Their hands raced up and down eachnother's bodies as their hips ground against each other, arousing themnboth. He pulled away, grinning, before beginning to remove hisnjeans. \"How did we end up...?\" Her thoughts were lost asnhis lips met hers again and his hands pulled her underwear down fromnunder her skirt. \"I'm wearing a...? But I never...\" Thenfeeling of his knee between her legs ended all question. And as hisnlips crashed against hers once more..... \"Ah!\" Alice sat upnin bed, panting and sweating. She looked around, expecting to seenWillard, but finding nothing. She sighed and laid back against hernpillow, afraid to touch her lips, lest she wash away the feel of hisnsoft lips on hers. \"I've only really known him for two weeks, yetnI'm having dreams about him? God, what's wrong with me?\" Shenrolled over and clutched her pillow, imagining it was him. \"It'llnnever happen. I should just treasure our friendship while it lasts.\" The NextnDay(Tuesday) \"Lunchtime. nFinally.\" Alice stood and stretched, watching everyone file out ofnthe office for their lunch break. Soon, only she and Willard werenleft. \"I wonder if he'd...?\" She walked over to hisndesk, causing him to look up. Smiling slightly, henasked, \"What's up, Alice?\" \"I was wondering ifnyou wanted to go get lunch with me. There's a McDonald's just downnthe street.\" He glanced away for anfew moments, thinking, before replying, \"Okay, sure. Let's go.\" nSmiling, she took his hand and together they began walking. Willardnwas blushing, but he did not pull his hand away. It felt good to benclose to someone, to feel a gentle touch. Besides, lots of friendsnheld hands, right? As they walked, theyntalked, mostly about books, as neither of them really kept up withncurrent events. \"So, Willard,\" saidnAlice as they sat down with their food; she with an order of chickennnuggets and fries, he with a sandwich and soda. \"Eh?\" he responded,nsipping his drink. \"Which do you thinknis better, the original Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux,nor the newer movie version with Gerard Butler?\" As she waited fornhim to respond, she ate a few of her nuggets. \"The book, but onlynbecause the relationships seem more developed. I rather liked thenmusic from the movie, though.\" \"Yeah, I agree. Heh,ndo you think it's bad that I wanted Erik to win Christine?\" nWillard seemed a bit surprised by her confession. \"You wanted Erik tonwin?\" Alice blushed and sheepishly smiled. \"Yeah, I've alwaysnbeen the one person that roots for the underdog, or the misunderstoodnvillain, to win. That's probably because I've always been thenunderdog, the beaten mutt.\" \"Huh. How so?\" \"Well...\" She atena few of her fries, debating on whether or not to tell him. \"I'vennever told anyone...\" Sensing her discomfort,nWillard said, \"If you don't want to tell me, it's okay.\" \"No, I'll tell you. nFor most of my life, my mother was sick. At first, she would tell menshe was dying, and I would cry and cry, but then she'd be okay and Inwould be happy. But after awhile, I stopped believing her, and shenstarted to hate me. At first, she'd just cuss at me, but after a fewnyears, she started throwing things at me, and telling me she wasngoing to abandon me. She'd also tell me that she was going to killnherself and that it would be my fault. Every night, I'd cry myselfnto sleep, until finally, eight years ago, just a week before myneighteenth birthday, she finally died.\" Embarrassed by hernconfession, she looked away from Willard, thinking what she'd saidninappropriate. His eyes wide, he placed his hand on hers, gentlyncaressing her fingers with his thumb. He cooed, \"It's okay,nAlice...\" \"I know. I tellnmyself that every night.\" She eventually turned back to her foodnand they finished eating in silence. As they walked back to thenoffice, Willard took her hand in his and slightly leaned against her. \"You know I'm here ifnyou need to talk.\" \"I know, Willard, andnI appreciate it.\" \"So, that offer tonsee a movie together.... Does it still stand?\" \"Of course.\" \"I'll call yountonight with the time and place. 'K?\" Smiling, she replied,n\"'K.\"[Chapter 5] Friday \"So, ready to go, Willard?\" asked Alice as she walked over to his desk. They'd eaten lunch together just about every day that week, and she hoped that Friday would be no exception. \"Well, I actually brought something for lunch today,\" he said, pulling a bag from one of his desk's drawers. Her smile left her face. \"Oh... I guess I'll go by myself then....\" she said, sighing and turning to leave. She stopped, though, after he grabbed her arm. \"No, I brought enough for both of us,\" he explained. \"Oh!\" She pulled one of the chairs over to his desk and sat across from him, wondering what he had to eat. From the bag he produced a large Ziploc bag full of brownies. \"Wait, what? Brownies?\" He opened the bag and set it on the desk before taking one and motioning for her to do the same. Alice did so and bit into it, her eyes widening as she ate. \"Dude, this is good!\" \"Wow, these are good! Where'd you buy these?\" she asked, wanting to get some for a treat one day. He sheepishly replied, \"I actually made them myself...\" \"Really? Man, I wish I could cook like this, or at all for that matter. I can't even make ramen noodles.\" \"Well, I could teach you a little bit after the movie tomorrow. Just, it'd need to be at your place. My mother's still a bit...\" \"Yeah... So, it's a date then! Er...\" She blushed and ate another brownie to avoid talking, less she say something even stupider. Willard chuckled and ate another brownie. As he reached for a third one, he stopped, wondering why Alice was staring at him and snickering. \"What?\" he asked, cocking his head slightly. \"You've got...oh, forget it.\" With that said, she reached over and brushed at the corners of his lips, knocking a few crumbs to the desk. \"So soft...\" She could not help herself. Gently, she ran her hand down his cheek, causing both of them to blush. His hand moved to top hers, pushing her hand against his face. He relished her touch; he did not know why, but he did. He leaned into her hand, smiling slightly. \"Ahem!\" coughed someone from the office doorway. Instantly, the two broke apart, blushing more than they had before. \"Honestly can't you two do that somewhere else? I mean, there are cameras here!\" It was Ms. Leach, the secretary, and for once, she looked angry instead of depressed. \"She's right... We're just friends. He doesn't have feelings for me. He just responded because he's a guy and that's what they do.\" Alice stood and walked over to her desk, unable to force herself to look at Willard or Ms. Leach. She heard footsteps and into her line of vision came the bag of brownies. \"You can have them; I can always make more.\" She stammered out a, \"Thank you,\" and put the bag in one of her drawer's. \"So, are we still on for...?\" \"Oh, yeah, of course, Willard.\" She heard him walk away and put her head down, wondering if he knew just how much his kindness meant to her. \"It feels so good to think that he actually cares for me, even just as a friend... And even if we are always just friends, I want to make him a thousand times happier than he is, because he deserves it.\"[Chapter 6] Saturday \"I gotta hurry... nCan't believe I lost track of time like this...\" Alice pulled on anroyal purple t-shirt and began brushing her hair, flinching as thenbrush hit knot after knot. \"The movie's at one, and it's 12:45nright now. He'll probably be here in-\" Knock, knock. \"Now.\" She quickly finished with her hair and looked herselfnover in the mirror, inspecting her pale skin and dark brown hair. \"I look sick, and my hair looks like really ugly bark. Great. Atnleast my eyes are rather nice, what with their normal coloration ofnbrown with green flecks.\" Another knock sounded. \"Coming!\"nshe shouting, leaving her bedroom and walking through the living roomnto the front door. She opened it and lost her breath for a moment. nThere stood Willard, wearing blue jeans and a dark blue shirt thatnfit just tight enough to reveal that he was rather well built. Overnthe shirt was a black jacket; it was beaten up and worn. Noticing her staring,nhe apologized, \"I'm sorry, but this is my only jacket and it'snsupposed to rain later and...\" \"No, it's okay. nReally. Besides, you're doing better than me. I haven't had anjacket in years.\" He seemed puzzled by this, but cast the thoughtnaside as they walked together to his car. He apologized for thencar's poor quality, but once more she admitted to him that he wasnstill doing better than her; she took the bus everywhere. \"That'snactually why I haven't had a jacket in years. Bus fares just keepngoing up and up.\" On the way to thentheater, Alice snuggled into her seat and watched the city zoom bynoutside. \"Huh?\" She jumped in her seat as she felt anhand on her thigh. \"Ah, sorry!\" cried Willard, pulling back. \"Inwas reaching for the PRNDL and, well...\" Blushing furiously, shenlooked out the window once more and replied, \"It's okay...\" \"No it's not... nDon't just accept everything someone does to you as okay.\" \"Looknwho's callin' the kettle black.\" \"I don't acceptneverything, but we're friends, right? Friends joke around and makenmistakes and...\" She couldn't think of anything else to name. Thenonly things she really knew about friendship was from books andnmovies. \"I guess you'renright....\" At the theater, Willard parked the car and they walkednup to buy their tickets. Willard bought hers, despite her protests,nand they walked in together. He also bought the popcorn and sodas. nThey entered the room the movie was showing in and walked up to thentop row. \"Thank you,\" saidnAlice, leaning her head against his shoulder. Smiling slightly, henlet his head rest on hers. \"You're welcome,\"nhe said, slipping his arm around her shoulders. That was how theynsat during the movie, moving only to eat a bite of the popcorn or tondrink from their sodas. After the movie was over, they walked backnto the car, and every-so-often, Alice would toss a piece of popcornnat Willard's head until, finally, he he took it away from her. \"Youndon't get popcorn. You're unworthy.\" She reached around him andnover him, trying to reclaim the bucket, but ending up rubbing hernhand over his chest and arms, causing him to blush. She smirked andngently ran a finger along his jawline, causing him to tremble andnclose his eyes. Seeing his defenses lowered, she grabbed the bucketnand stepped back a few paces. \"Ha! I win!\" Hisneyes shot opened and he groaned. \"No fair! My dumbnboy brain can't handle stuff like that!\" She smiled and walkednover to him. He reached for the bucket, but she moved it and slippednher arms around his waist, embracing him. \"I'm sorry,nWillard...\" she mumbled. He wrapped his arms around her, ignoringnhis brain's cries of protest. They stayed that was for a fewnminutes, until Alice's crotch brushed against his, sending a surge ofnfeelings through them both. Blushing, they broke apart, mumblingnapologies. They then walked back to the car, both ignoring theninstinct to grasp each other's hand. \"So, back to yournplace for the cooking lesson?\" he asked, finding his voice. \"Oh, yes,\" shenreplied, looking out the window. Neither of them spoke during thenride, and once they were at her place, Willard was a little hesitantnto come in. \"I'm not gonna bite you,\" she said, joking around. \"That's not what I'mnworried about...\" he said, entering with his eyes on the floor. nShe blushed, realizing what he was implying. \"So, where is...?\" \"To your right.\" nHe turned, feeling a bit stupid as he discovered her kitchen wasnright next to the front door. Silently, he searched the cabinetsnbefore pulling out a packet of ramen noodles. \"Where is all of yournfood, Alice?\" \"I usually eat out,\"nshe admitted. \"But still, if youngot sick, what would you eat?\" \"I guess I'd starve.\"n He sighed and shook his head, dissatisfied with her answer. \"Well, come here andnwatch me make these.\" She nodded and did as told, watching as henheated the water to a boil, then broke the noodles up and placed themnin the pan. After a few minutes, he put the packet of spice in andnstirred before draining the pan in the sink and putting the noodlesnin a bowl. \"There. Can you remember that?\" She nodded and said,n\"Boil water, put noodles in for three minutes, put in spice, drain,nthen eat.\" He nodded and smiled. \"Right. Very good. nNow, eat up,\" he said, offering the bowl to her. She took it, onlynto remember why you are never to touch the bottom of bowl of hotnstuff. \"Ow!\" she cried,nsetting the bowl on the counter and waving her hands, as if perhapsnshe could shake the pain away. \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\"nsaid Willard, taking her hands in his and looking them over. \"Theynlook okay, but still...\" He turned the cold water on and held hernhands under the faucet. \"Better?\" She nodded and dried hernhands on her shirt. \"I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to-\" henstopped talking as she hugged him. \"It's okay, Willard. nAccidents happen.\" \"I suppose you'renright...\" \"Of course I am,\"nshe said, standing on her tip-toes and pecking him on the tip of hisnnose. He blushed and, before he could stop himself, leaned in andnkissed her gently on the lips. Their eyes closed and they leanedninto each other; his hands pushed against her back, forcing herncloser to him. Their bodies rubbed against each other and the kissndeepened. Willard, feeling his legs become weak, fell back againstnone of the counters, bringing Alice with him and sending a dishnclattering to the floor. The sudden noise brought them back tonreality, and they broke apart, panting and staring at each other. \"I'm-\" begannWillard. \"Sorry,\" finishednAlice. \"I shouldn't have...\" \"No, it was mynfault...\" He pulled himself up and headed for the door, his headndown and his eyes brimming with tears of embarrassment. If he'dnglanced at Alice, he would have realized she was already crying. n\"Goodbye, see you at work,\" he said, part of him not wanting tonleave. She stood and walked to the door, fighting the urge to kissnhim goodbye. \"See you,\" shensaid, closing the door and locking it before collapsing, sobbing asnher face burned. \"I'm so stupid! He doesn't love me! Thatnwasn't his choice! It was his hormones! Any straight guy would'vendone that!\" She sniffled. \"But his eyes... That look innthem was the look of love, wasn't it?\"[Chapter 7] Monday Willard was late tonwork again, and as he entered the office, the boss, Mr. Martin,ncornered him. \"Listen, Tiger, I can't have you being late likenthis.\" The nervous male started to respond but Mr. Martin cut himnoff. \"Now, I care that your mother's sick. I really do, but thisnis ridiculous. I mean, you've been late every day for two weeks,nthis being the start of the third one!\" Alice's eyes narrowednas she and everyone else in the office listened. Mr. Martin couldncare less about Willard's mother. He was just setting the poor mannup so he could destroy him. \"Now, if you're late one more time,nit's coming out of your pay. Got it, Tiger?\" Willard solemnlynnodded and, after Mr. Martin left, sat at his desk. He did not looknaround or begin his work; he just sat there, clenching his fists tonkeep from crying. At lunchtime, everyonenleft and Alice walked over to Willard, who had still not changednposition. Gingerly, she took his hand in hers, ignoring the fact itnwas pale and sweaty. \"Willard?\" He did not respond to her. Shenrubbed her cheek against his hand, and slowly, he turned his headntowards her. \"Alice...?\" Shennodded. \"Don't let him beatnyou, Willard. He's-\" she was cut off as Willard pulled his handnaway from her and pulled her in so his lips could cover hers. Shenreturned the kiss, and mentally willed what happiness she had tontransfer to him. Eventually, he releasednher lips and said, \"Forgive me.\" \"It's okay...\" \"No, it's not! Stopnsaying it is!\" he shouted, knocking a container of pencils to thenfloor. \"It's not okay for me to just kiss you out of the blue likenthat!\" \"If I didn't want younto, I wouldn't let you do it.\" His eyes widened and he shifted hisnattention to the discarded pencils. She joined him on the floor andngathered what she could. \"Heh, this is almost like how we met,nisn't it? The only difference is, this time you knocked the stupidnstuff down.\" Fighting his brain once more, he captured her lips innanother kiss, sending warmnth rushing through her body. This time,nhis tongue asked entrance and she allowed it, moaning lightly as thendigit explored her mouth. His hand snaked its way behind her headnonce more as she let him push her backwards onto the floor. Shenpulled his body closer to hers, reveling in the feeling of his touch.n His free hands began trailing up her body, hesitating as it began tonworm its way under her shirt. \"Hey, only I can havensex in this office!\" The two blushing adults broke apart, unablento look at each other. \"Really, can't you two do that somewherenelse? I mean geez! And to think if I'd walked in a few secondsnlater. Aw!\" Alice stood and raced past the secretary, whilenWillard remained sitting on the floor. \"Well? Aren't you gonna gonafter her?\" Shakily, he stood and exited the room, his pacenpicking up as he realized Alice was running. He turned the cornernand left the building, running at full speed as he glimpsed hernheading into an alley. As he entered the alley, his eyes went wide. Alice was on thenground, out cold, and towering above her were three guys, onenwielding a tire iron. \"Don't be a hero, man. Just walk away,\"nsneered the armed one. They were all a little taller than him, butnhe couldn't just leave Alice to these guys, could he? Summoning his courage,nWillard ran at them, punching the smallest one in the face. nInstantly, the tire iron came down hard on his shoulder; ignoring thensearing pain, he turned and punched the other unarmed one beforendigging his fist into the chest of the one with the weapon. \"D*mmit,nhe's fast!\" The tire iron came down again, this time on his uppernarm. A sickening crack sounded and he let out a cry of pain, but henfought the urge to fall to the ground. Instead, he punched with allnof his strength, aiming right for the thug's face. He hit andnsmirked as the weak nose shattered beneath his fist. Blood gushednout from the wound and the thug backed away. \"Aw, d*mn! Thatnb**ch broke my f**cking nose!\" The other two thugs backed away asnwell. \"Come on, guys. There're easier targets in the park.\" nThe trio ran away, leaving Willard to collapse beside Alice, who wasnstill knocked out. Knowing he had no cellphone, he searched hernpockets and found one. \"911, what is yournemergency?\" asked the voice on the phone. \"My friend and I werenjumped in an alley; she's out cold and I'm in pretty bad shape.\" \"Tell me yournlocation, Sir.\" \"We're in an alleynthat's just to the right of the Martin & Stiles Co. building.\" \"Emergency officialsnare being dispatched to your location, Sir.\" He hung up the phonenand looked down at Alice. He caressed her cheek lightly with hisnhand, smiling down at her. \"Don't worry. You'rensafe,\" he said, kissing her forehead before pulling her head intonhis lap. \"You'll be okay. We'll both be okay.\" Later, In thenHospital Willard looked up fromnhis bed as someone entered the dark room, bathing him in light fromnthe hallway. \"Yes?\" he asked, his voice timid. \"Why's it so dark innhere, Willard?\" asked a female voice. \"Well, Alice, it isnten o' clock at night,\" he replied. \"Well, yeah, butnstill,\" she said, standing beside his bed. She looked him overnbefore lowering her head and leaning against the bed. \"What's wrong? Arenyou in pain?\" he asked, trying reach over and touch her, butnfailing painfully. \"I'm fine. It's younI'm worried about. I mean, look at you! A dislocated left shouldernand a broken right arm? Oh, why didn't you run and leave me there?\"nshe asked, tears running down her face. \"Friends don't leavenfriends at the mercy of people like that!\" Alice stopped cryingnand said, \"You're the first who hasn't abandoned me as soon as thengoing got tough.\" She reached over and gently pulled his face nearnhers, nuzzling her face into his black hair. She then pressed hernlips to his, absentmindedly running her hand up and down his scalp. nHe moaned into her mouth, desperately asking for more. She brokenaway and nuzzled her face against his before turning to leave. \"Don't!\" henshouted, unable to grab her arm to stop her. She heeded his wishesnand sat in a chair between his bed and the window. \"Alice, I willnnever regret protecting you.\" \"Oh, how wrong younare,\" she muttered sadly. \"They always regret it...\"[Chapter 8] For the next two weeks,nWillard was basically ignored by everyone at work except Alice. Theynstill did not accept him, but none of them were quite comfortablengiving him trouble once they found out just how he had come to be sonbadly injured. Every day, Alice helped Willard with his work,ncausing her to slowly fall behind. That is how, exactly two weeksnand three days after the incident, she found herself working overtimenin a desperate attempt to catch up. Across from her sat Willard, whonwas fiddling with his cast to distract himself. \"You can leave, younknow? I'm sure your mother needs your help anyway.\" Willard knewnshe was right, but he didn't feel comfortable leaving her alone. nHe'd actually been so concerned for her when he was released from thenhospital that he'd insisted on driving her to and from work everynday, which ended up making them both late, but no one at the officensaid anything about it. \"She can wait;nbesides, you're almost done.\" She nodded and hurried through thenrest of the work, not caring that her handwriting was deterioratingnwith every line. Finally, she said,n\"Done.\" \"Great,\" saidnWillard, standing. \"Now let's go.\" \"Just a minute. Inneed to put this on Mr. Martin's desk first.\" She tidied thenpapers a bit before walking into the boss' empty office and settingnthem on his desk. \"All right, let's go,\" she said, running outnand grabbing Willard's left hand. He groaned lightly in pain,ncausing her to let go. \"Oh, I'm sorry. Does your shoulder stillnhurt?\" He nodded but took her hand in his. \"It's okay, Alice,\"nhe said, kissing her lightly on the nose. She blushed and grippednhis hand firmly. \"Good.\" Theynwalked to his car and rode off towards her apartment. Once again, henaccidentally groped her thigh instead of the PRNDL. She did not jumpnthis time, but instead shuddered as he rubbed his hand up and downnbefore moving away. \"Now if could only get his hand a littlenfurther over...\" She blushed at the thought. \"Naughty,nnaughty girl...\" Atnher apartment, they said their goodbyes and shared a chaste kissnbefore going their separate ways. Once inside, Alice collapsed onnher bed, thinking. \"We can't just call ourselves friendsnnow, can we? I mean, we kiss more often than friends ever-wait,nfriends don't ever kiss, do they? And his touch... It's becomingnmore desperate, more pleading. Then again, so is mine...\" She sighed and covered her face with her pillow. \"Inguess I'll ask him if he wants to make it official next time I seenhim.\" ThenNext Day(Friday) Willard did not show at work the next day, so after work, Alice rodenthe bus and then walked the rest of the way to his house. As shenapproached it, something felt different. Something was...missing. She hurried up the steps and knocked on the door, but earned nonreply. \"Willard? It's Alice. Please let me in.\" Stillnnothing. Seeing no other way to get him to answer she cried, \"Oh,nGod, Willard, help me! They're after me!\" Almost instantly, thendoor swung open and out stepped Willard, armed with a butcher knife. n\"Hey, whoa, wait! It's okay!\" He looked around and then lookednat her. \"You'rennot...?\" \"No,nI just-\" \"Thatnwasn't funny,\" he said coldly. He lowered the knife and walkednback in the house, followed by Alice. She closed and locked the doornbefore apologizing. \"I'mnsorry, you just wouldn't answer and I was scared and-\" The knifenfell to the floor and Willard turned, burrowing his face in her chestnand knocking her to the floor. \"Will...?\" He was sobbing. Shenwrapped her arms around him, rubbing up and down his back as he criednagainst her, soaking her shirt. After what felt like hours, henlooked up at her and incoherently mumbled something. \"What?\" shenasked, laying her head on his. \"She'sndead...\" he moaned before letting out a heart-wrenching wail. \"His mother...? Oh, God...\" She held him tighter, whispering sweet nothings to him, trying toncalm him down. \"Last night.... Oh, the rats... Oh, God!\" Shennuzzled his scalp and kissed him again and again, unaware that shenwas now crying. They sat there, crying together, for hours untilnfinally, they had no more tears left. Willard stood first, stumbling into the living room, and a fewnminutes later, Alice joined him. He was sitting on the couch,nwatching the fire crack and burn. Silently, she sat beside him andnallowed him to pull her close. After awhile, they laid downntogether, Alice held close against his chest, and fell asleep, bothnhaunted by dreams of sorrow and death. Morning Alicenawoke first and found herself staring up at Willard's face. Hisncheeks and under his eyes were red, obviously from crying. Reachingnup, she gently caressed his face, willing his sadness to leave. \"It's my fault. nIf he hadn't stayed after with me, he would've been there for her...\" She slowly pushed his arm off of her waist and snuck off of thencouch and out of the room. As she reached the front door, though, anvoice stopped her. \"Alice... Please, don't leave me...\" Shenreturned to the living room and sat in one of the armchairs, notnfeeling it appropriate to lay down-again-with a guy whose mother justndied. Willardncurled up, sobbing \"Oh, God, I miss her... She shouldn't havengone... Oh, God!\" Alice stood and embraced him, holding him closenas he cried out for his mother. \"He'snlike a lost child... It's so sad...\" She kissed his forehead and nuzzled him, desperately trying tonconsole him. \"Please... Don't leave me alone... I don't think Incould stand it...\" She kissed his forehead again and again. \"Don'tnworry. I'll never leave you, Willard.\" He gripped her shirt andnpushed himself against her, as if trying to meld with her.

And as for Carter, he couldn't wait to kick back and relax, However, it would be crammed, the apartment they rented was made for only one person, now he had to fit Lee in too. Well, somehow they managed to fix it up for three people. \"Where're you going?\" Lee asked, one day after they finished remodeling. \"I'm going to go talk to one of my cousins in town, I'll be back before you notice I'm gone,\" Carter replied. \"Carter!\" Lee yelled. \"What? What? What is it Lee?\" Carter rushed back. \"Nothing, what took you so long?\" Lee asked. \"Very funny man, very funny, now look, it's 2:00 now, I'll be back by 3:50,\" Carter checked his watch. \"Why be gone so long?\" Lee asked. \"Because it's supposed to rain by 4:00 O' clock, that's how come, I wanna get as much enjoyment out of this sorry day as I can, now I'll see you later,\" Carter walked out. \"CARTER!\" Lee yelled. \"What? What is it?\" Carter rushed back again. \"Just testing, what kept you?\" Lee asked. \"Look, from now on, don't call me unless it's an emergency,\" Carter walked away again. \"CARTER!\" \"What now?\" \"You forgot your cell phone,\" Lee replied. After that, Carter left, which was okay for Lee because he got tired of having him around. Shortly after having another 14-year-long feud with his cousin, Carter slowly headed through the middle of town. However, within a few minutes, he began to hear what sounded like a cat screeching, the further he went into the town, the louder it got. In no time, Carter realized that several gang boys were beating on another kid. \"Hey!\" Carter started to pull out his badge and police I.D, but the kids ran away, leaving the victim standing alone. She looked like a normal kid, she stood about five feet something tall, black, and she had blue streaks up and down her body. The girl didn't say anything, she just turned and ran down the streets, while Carter stood at the scene yelling up at her. \"Yeah, run away! Just don't forget, it was James Carter L.A.P.D who saved your life!\" Carter yelled. However, the girl didn't say anything, she just turned her head back for a glance at him one more time before she disappeared into the streets. Carter started to yell to thin air as he walked back to the building, he decided not to tell Lee about what happened earlier; especially since he didn't think it was any of his business in the first place. \"Carter, where have you been?\" Lee asked. \"I ain't been nowhere, why?\" Carter asked. \"Because we've got something to do,\" Lee explained. \"Hold it just a hot diggity dang second, this ain't like last time when we was in Hong Kong, and you didn't have the guts to tell me we were tracking down Ricky Tan is it?\" Carter asked. \"Of course not, this time I'm telling you head on,\" Lee replied. \"Well that's good, I'd hate to be getting my groove on one second then fall fifteen stories on my butt the next. So what be happening this time?\" Carter asked. \"This time, we meet Hojun Daneto down by fifteen miles, he has an underground hideout,\" Lee explained. \"Oh joy, does this mean we've gotta be burrowing for fifteen miles?\" Carter asked. \"No, just follow me, and let me take care of the driving,\" Lee said. \"Now hold on, the last time I let you take care of the driving here, we found a new home in the junk yard,\" Carter reminded him. \"That was your fault,\" Lee said. \"My fault?\" Carter asked. \"Yes, you too busy being a back-seat driver to tell me, we were heading for garbage truck,\" Lee explained. \"It don't matter no more,\" Carter said. \"Exactly, so stop screaming at me,\" Lee brought up. \"I'm not screaming.\" \"You' screaming.\" \"I am not.\" \"You are.\" \"No I ain't man.\" That continued all the way out to the car, onto the road, down the stairs, and into the hideout. \"Will you stop? You acting like two-year-old potato,\" Lee said. \"Oh, fine, you wanna pick up where we would have been if we had known each other as kids? Fine, I'm telling your mommy,\" Carter shouted. \"I'm telling your mommy that you bit the neighbor's dog,\" Lee replied. \"Hey, that wasn't the dog, that was the mother-in-law and she was bugging me anyway,\" Carter said. \"Silence!\" Hojun Daneto stated. \"Sorry Hojun,\" Lee said. \"This is the guy? I've seen better in those crappy horror movies,\" Carter started. \"Carter, do not get started with me, we are here on serious matters, not for some 'wooshu',\" Lee said. \"You're right, you're right, I apologize, now can we get this over with?\" Carter asked. \"Follow me gentlemen,\" Hojun walked away. Lee made a movement on the left side of his mouth. \"What's that supposed to mean? Oh I get it, it means you go this way and I got that way, right?\" Carter asked. \"No that means follow me before I choke you with bad looking coat,\" Lee explained. \"Hey! What's the matter with this coat?\" Carter asked. \"Be quiet and start walking,\" Lee said. \"During the last six years, we have been on the lookout for a serial killer, his name's Leo Abo, he's slaughtered forty-eight people so far, while looking for something very valuable,\" Hojun explained. \"Valuable? Like what?\" Carter asked. \"That's the problem, nobody ever found out, but we have reason to believe it's a rare 15 oz. emerald with 24ct. gold lining, it carries a 14ct. ruby within the 27 oz. diamond hidden within the emerald. The thing of the matter is, nobody knows what happened to the emerald, it disappeared just recently this year,\" Hojun said. \"So what've we gotta do? Look for the gem?\" Carter asked. \"Not exactly, you're to look after this person,\" Hojun loaded a data disk into a super computer system. The holographic figure of a girl came on the screen. \"Are you kidding?\" Carter asked, \"I'm an L.A.P.D, what do I want to do with a kid?\" \"We have reason to believe she might be partly responsible for the disappearance of the emerald. She's fourteen years old, who has something in with the L.A.P.D as well, it appears that she just dropped into town,\" Hojun said. \"So what've we gotta do?\" Carter asked. \"Watch her until we find Leo Abo, don't let her out of your sight at any cost, if Abo finds her, he might kill her and we'll never find out where the emerald disappeared to,\" Hojun explained. \"So what you're saying is that we've gotta hijack this kid and keep her with us for who knows how long?\" Carter asked. \"It appears so,\" Lee replied. \"I'm L.A.P.D, not a baby-sitter,\" Carter said. \"It's either you baby-sit her, or you baby-sit each other while on unemployment. If you don't take this case Carter, I'll see to it that you're no longer a P.D in the L.A or N.Y or anywhere else in the U.S.A, do you understand, F.W.I?\" Hojun asked. \"You can't do that, I'm L.A.P.D, not N.Y.P.D,\" Carter replied. \"Me either, I'm from Hong Kong,\" Lee added. \"You think that I don't know your employers? All I have to do is give them a bad report on each of you and you're out of a job. Now either you watch this kid or else, do you understand?\" Hojun asked. \"Yes sir,\" Carter said. \"Mr. Daneto, we might need a regular picture of her to recognize her,\" Lee brought up. \"Here's her picture out of uniform, I suggest you don't let your guard down when you find her, she's dangerous,\" Hojun replied. \"Allright, what's she look like?\" Carter asked. \"It says, 5'4\", 115 lbs, 14 years old, black, blue sunburn,\" Lee read. \"Blue sun----? Oh hell no, hell no, not that, not that,\" Carter slapped himself. \"What?\" Lee asked. \"Shoot Lee, I saw that kid earlier today, I rescued her from a whole pack of gang members today!\" Carter screamed. \"Well don't scream at me for your carelessness,\" Lee poked him. \"I'm not screaming,\" Carter said. \"Oh yes you are!\" Lee shouted. As the two walked out of Hojun's hideout, they kept arguing about the girl. \"Carter, we won't be able to find this girl,\" Lee said. \"Of course we will. She's got a blue sunburn, out of all the people in New York, how hard can that be to find on one person?\" Carter asked. \"You would be surprised,\" Lee replied. \"Allright, I've seen this kid, she doesn't like coming out in the daytime so we'll go look for her at night,\" Carter thought. \"Lee, what the hell do you think you're doing?\" Carter asked, when they got back to the apartment. \"You said she was fourteen years old, right?\" Lee asked. \"So?\" Carter said. \"So I figure, we might as well make it look like somebody lives here,\" Lee said. \"Somebody does live here, me!\" Carter yelled. \"I know that, but it doesn't look like there'll be a teenager living here,\" Lee explained. \"How do you figure?\" Carter asked. \"Carter, if you were a fourteen-year-old troublemaker, would you want to live here?\" Lee asked. Carter kept his mouth shut and looked around the apartment and reached a conclusion. \"Man, let's trash the place!\" Carter said. To be continued...[Chapter 2] Rush Hour 3, Pt II \"I know that kid ain't going to remember me, so I figured we better use the fool proof method of getting her without causing a disturbance,\" Carter said as they approached the scene of the crime. \"Carter, I don't think cold blood is all that necessary,\" Lee replied. \"Not that, we're gonna kidnap her, it's the only way,\" Carter said. \"Carter, if she is in ca-joots with the police, then I doubt she'll be that easy to kidnap,\" Lee brought up. \"She ain't working with the police,\" Carter argued. \"Yes she is,\" Lee said. \"No she ain't, they're just keeping a lookout for her because she's got something to do with the gem that's gone missing,\" Carter explained. \"--------Oh,\" Lee said. Carter put a sudden stop to the car. \"What is it now?\" Lee asked. \"That's her, that's the girl,\" Carter pointed. \"Are you sure?\" Lee asked. \"Of course I'm sure, I know a kid with a blue sunburn when I see her,\" Carter answered, \"now let's get her.\" The two sprung out of the car and grabbed the girl, she spun herself upside-down and kicked the two in the head at once. That caused them to drop her on the ground, she tried to get up and runaway, but Carter grabbed her by the arm. The girl punched him in the jaw with her other hand and ran. Lee tried to block off the only way out of there, but the girl kicked him in the mouth and vamoosed. \"What is the matter with her?\" Carter asked. \"Maybe she don't like the idea of being kidnapped by two police officers,\" Lee suggested. \"Get going, we've gotta find her,\" Carter shoved him. The girl came out of hiding and held something up in her hand. \"Freeze! L.A.P.D,\" they heard. \"What?\" Carter asked. The girl threw her I.D at Carter, knocking him on the ground. \"That girl fights dirty! She packed her I.D with a rock!\" Carter pulled out a large rock. The girl turned and ran away from the scene, leaving Carter and Lee down on their luck. \"That girl's crazy!\" Carter yelled. \"It's no use, she got away, we come back tomorrow and look for her,\" Lee said. \"How do you know she'll be back tomorrow?\" Carter asked, \"Huh? And in broad daylight?\" \"Bad weather,\" Lee replied. \"What?\" Carter asked. \"She has sunburn, and people who have sunburn don't come out in the sunlight, in her case, she looks like she enjoys bad weather. The weather people say 'that we get rain tomorrow', she'll come back,\" Lee said. \"She just kicked you in the mouth and you talk like she hit you in the head with a rock,\" Carter replied. As soon as they got back to the apartment, they received a phone call from Hojun. \"Did you get the girl?\" he asked. \"No, she got away, we'll get tomorrow,\" Lee answered. \"You better hope you get her before Leo Abo does,\" Hojun brought up. \"What? She is just little girl, what he want with her?\" Lee asked. \"That's what we're trying to figure out, but we have plenty of potential answers,\" Hojun answered. With that, the conversation ended, Hojun hung up and left Lee looking like an even bigger dummy than he was at the time. \"What happened?\" Carter asked. \"Hojun said that Leo Abo will get her tomorrow if we don't get her first,\" Lee said. Morning came and the two were out to find the girl, of course that meant carrying an umbrella for when it started to rain. \"There's the place,\" Lee said. However, the place seemed pretty empty, nobody around for miles, that was when they heard something snap. And wham! The girl fell out of the tree above and into Lee's arms. Without using any words, she already made it clear she was trouble by kissing Lee on the mouth. \"What are you doing?\" Lee asked. The girl spoke in Chinese, translated she said, \"just showing gratitude.\" Lee replied in Chinese, \"next time show gratitude to my insides.\" \"Man, what on earth are you two talking about?\" Carter asked in English. \"Carter, this is the girl,\" Lee said. Lee rolled up the girl's sleeve and saw a blue streak. \"Yeah, no doubt, that's her allright, now look, do you speak any English?\" Carter asked. However, the girl didn't answer him, she just looked at him funny. \"Shoot! I knew this would happen, I hate this! Everytime, I try to relax, the police, have to inform me about another mission. They get me all excited and give me a lemon! Shoot!\" Carter yelled. \"Well Carter, it looks like we're stuck with her,\" Lee said. \"Allright, look, put your bag in the back and we'll get the hell out of here,\" Carter said. The girl punched Carter in the stomach, apparently she had something against his mouth. \"Well, in short, it's your mistake and we're stuck with it,\" Lee smiled. \"Yeah? Just shutup and you translate her to me,\" Carter said. The girl hopped into the back and waited for the clown cops to show up. \"Now look, I've got a few rules for you when we get back to the apartment. Rule number one, no eating the furniture, we're still paying for it, rule number two, no killing anybody in their sleep. Rule number three, no bopping anyone over the head with heavy objects and stealing their clothes, not even the ones they wearing, rule number four, no dumping anybody butt naked into a pan of hot water with salt and pepper,\" Carter explained. Carter looked at the girl as she chewed her gum, looking for a good place to stick it. \"And last, and certainly not least for you, no taking out your chewed gum and flicking it into my hair,\" Carter finished. The girl took out her gum, rolled it up in a ball, and stuck it on Carter's seat. \"That's much better, now let's get out of here,\" Carter stuck the key into ignition, \"why can't we get a mission with someone who understands English, Lee?\" Lee shrugged and grinned; Carter backed up and drove out of there. End of chapter 2[Chapter 3] Rush Hour 3 & 1/2, pt 3 \"Shoot, I just remembered that we gotta keep this kid in our apartment and we don't even know her name,\" Carter grunted. Lee turned around to face the girl, she pulled out a pad of paper and a pen, she scribbled something down and handed it to Lee. \"She says her name is Thorn,\" Lee said. \"Thorn? What kind of Chinese name is that?\" Carter asked, \"What's your last name? Bush?\" Thorn scribbled something else down and handed it to Lee. \"She says her last name is Strong,\" Lee said. \"Strong? Man, I ain't never gonna understand you, her, or anybody else on this damn planet,\" Carter said. Thorn reached into her pocket and pulled out a card, she handed it to Carter and said something short in Chinese. \"What's this?\" Carter asked, taking the card. The card read 'Captain Turmoil Chief N.Y.B.I, New York, New York, P.D Building 3rd floor'. \"This guy someone you know?\" Carter asked. Thorn replied in Chinese '5th door to the right.' \"I'll take that as a yes,\" Carter said. \"Carter, if this girl knows the N.Y.B.I, then how come the F.B.I are looking for her?\" Lee asked. \"What you getting at?\" Carter asked. \"All I'm saying is, why would the Chief of the police and New York Bureau Investigation, know a fourteen-year-old, if something was not up?\" Lee asked. \"You got a point, allright, we'll dump the girl off at the apartment, then we'll check with Hojun,\" Carter answered. \"Hojun.\" Thorn spoke up. \"Yes, you know him?\" Lee asked. Thorn started speaking in Chinese again about Hojun, and the whole time, she was spitting. \"Translation please?\" Carter asked. \"She said that she knows Hojun, and that she thinks she can point out Leo Abo,\" Lee answered. Thorn looked at him confused, \"Leo Abo?\" \"Yes, L-E-O-A-B-O,\" Lee responded. Thorn wrote down the letters to the fool's name, and mixed them around. \"L-e-a-b, ohhhhhhhhhh,\" she whispered. \"Wait a minute,\" Carter said. He crazily made a U-Turn, drove over the curb and parked right on top of it. \"Carter, what're you doing?\" Lee asked as they hopped out of the car. \"What does it look like I'm doing? I think I just found our crook,\" Carter said, \"come on.\" \"Uh Carter, I think we better bring her along too. In the time we're gone she could blow up your car,\" Lee suggested. \"With what?\" \"C4.\" \"Allright, we'll bring her along, but you better stay back, this is police work,\" Carter told Thorn. Thorn put the pad of paper into her shirt and hopped out of the car as well, tailing behind the police. \"Carter, you don't even know what we're looking for,\" Lee said. \"I do,\" Thorn said in Chinese. \"I know, but how many guys look like Juntao's right hand Sang?\" Carter asked. \"You're right, let's go,\" Lee said. All three fools followed each other closely behind the other, Carter with the lead of course. He pulled his head out around the corner of a brick building and saw the man. He was talking with a man resembling Ricky Tan, and two other thugs, (no past character resemblance in either one though). What appeared to be the guy they were looking for handed the leader of the gang something that resembled explosives. \"Looks like dynamite,\" Carter said. Thorn bit her lower lip, she had something to say but she wasn't about to. Carter reached for his badge, but instead he grabbed one of his guns, Lee grabbed the gun, and Thorn grabbed his. Carter grabbed another one, Lee grabbed it, so Carter pulled out a third gun, and Lee pulled out his own. \"Allright freeze! FBI!\" Carter yelled. The four people turned at him with mean eyes, Lee jumped out to help Carter. \"Freeze, I'm with him,\" Lee said. The goons pulled out four guns of their own, they tripped, flipped, and threw Carter and Lee down onto the asphalt. Thorn triggered the gun and stepped out from behind the building. \"It's allright guys, they're with me,\" Thorn said in English, \"it's L.A.P.D. That's Carter and this is Lee.\" Carter and Lee looked at each other and exchanged confused faces. \"So now all of a sudden you're speaking English on us huh?\" Carter asked as they walked back to the car. \"I'm American you embassy-imbecile, I was born to speak English,\" Thorn explained. \"Then how come you were talking Chinese on us earlier?\" Lee asked. \"Because, there is a huge difference in not speaking and not being able to speak, in your case, you two look like you like to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk, it helps make it easier to find out how full of crap they are,\" Thorn explained. \"Great, another you,\" Carter said. \"What's wrong with that?\" Lee asked. \"Nothing, but I'll tell you what's wrong with trying to arrest the city goons, I know them all by stupidity, they're so dumb cuz they went to a public school. They can't even count to see how old they are,\" Thorn said. Carter sighed and hopped into the car again, Lee hopped in the passenger seat, and Thorn hopped in the back. \"So Thorn, how do you know Hojun?\" Lee asked. \"My mother's brother's cousin's second step half uncle's mother's daughter's niece's sister's daughter used to work with him,\" Thorn answered. \"That clears things up,\" Lee said sarcastically. \"So why in the hell do we gotta watch you anyway Thorn?\" Carter asked. \"Because the F.B.I is out to get me, but it isn't the F.B.I,\" Thorn replied. \"Yeah, we know, Hojun told us about that, but don't worry, we'll make sure Leo Abo doesn't find you,\" Carter assured her. \"He will if that's the case,\" Thorn argued. \"How can you be sure?\" Lee asked. \"Because, that's the way he's gotten away with this for six years, Leo Abo as you know him, isn't even his name. His name is Leaboo!\" Thorn explained. \"Well how the hell do you know that?\" Carter asked. \"Because, I know who he is, he scrambled his name up so it would spell Leo Abo, that way the police could look far and wide, and they still wouldn't find him,\" Thorn explained \"So he knows that you' going to blow his cover and that's why he's out to get you?\" Carter asked. \"No, he doesn't know, he's out to get me for the emerald,\" Thorn said. \"Do you know where it is?\" Lee asked. \"Yes, but I can't tell until he's caught,\" Thorn replied. Thorn took out a compact mirror and looked behind her, cold shivers suddenly went down her back. \"Guys, that's Leaboo back there in the black convertible!\" Thorn shrieked. \"What? Moby Dick, that's Leaboo?\" Carter asked. Thorn nodded, Carter shifted the car into hyper speed, he made a crooked U-Turn, and went crookedly up and down. It threw Lee into the back seat with Thorn, only his feet were sticking up, and kicking very heavily. \"Carter! You're the worst driver I've ever seen!\" Lee shouted. \"Lee this is no time to be a backseat driver!\" Carter said, making a wrong turn in a one way lane. Leaboo sure knew how to catch the people he was looking for, he had a passenger in the car right next to him. The passenger in Leaboo's car took out a bazooka and shot at them. \"Dammit!\" Carter yelled. \"What's going on up there?\" Lee asked. Thorn stuck her head up, the passenger must've been a hit man Leaboo hired to take them out. Then, suddenly, Thorn got an idea. \"Lee, take my backpack and duck down, I'm not taking any prisoners,\" Thorn said. \"What do you mean?\" Lee asked. Thorn shot up with a gun in her hand, she aimed for the hit man and hit him, he rolled out of the car lying on the ground. Then she aimed again and blew out Leaboo's tires. \"Nice aim, all four of them,\" Lee said, \"Thorn, where on earth did you get the idea to do something that stupid?\" \"I watch a lot of Mafia movies,\" Thorn answered. \"You know that gun looks very familiar, where did you get it?\" Lee asked. \"I stole it from Carter's pocket.\" \"WHAT!\" Carter exploded. \"Wait a minute, I stole that gun from Carter, I put it in my shoe,\" Lee said. \"Then that would explain why you're looking shorter,\" Thorn returned. \"Man, now I know why Hojun set us up to watch you,\" Carter exhaled. Thorn sighed as they headed back to Lee and Carter's apartment. \"I can't believe this, an apartment that's only big enough for one person, we have to make enough room for two, and now there's gotta be enough room for three people, it's impossible!\" Carter complained. Thorn looked around, \"I agree Carter, one of us will have to sleep outside on the windowsill.\" \"Glad to know that you see it that way too,\" Carter grinned. \"Yeah, pack a pillow Carter, you're sleeping out there tonight,\" Thorn laughed. \"Shutup you two, we told Hojun we were going to keep you here and we're going to make this apartment big enough for the three of us,\" Lee said, \"whether we like it or not.\" \"How?\" Thorn and Carter asked. \"We force ourselves if we have to,\" Lee answered. \"So now you're going to start repeating me?\" Carter asked. \"I wasn't repeating you Carter, we both spoke at the same time, almost as if we were psychic as is done with twins,\" Thorn said. \"Or people who think alike,\" Carter added. \"And they also finish each other's sentences,\" Thorn finished. \"This is too freaky, I'm going to go take a cold bath, maybe I can wake up from this nightmare,\" Carter mumbled, slamming the bathroom door. \"So,\" Lee started, \"wazzup?\" Later, after Carter got out of the tub, he walked back into the living room to find Thorn chewing on a couch pillow. \"THORN! I thought I told you NOT to eat the furniture!\" Carter shirked. \"You did, but you didn't say, not to eat the furniture pillows,\" Thorn replied. \"Don't you eat normal food like some chicken wings, baby back ribs, pig's feet and ears?\" Carter asked. \"I don't eat soul food Carter,\" Thorn said. \"I didn't say soul food, I said normal food, the next thing you know you'll be telling me you ate Lee's left shoe,\" Carter said. \"No, she ate my right one,\" Lee argued. Carter screamed out of frustration, then------he got an idea. \"Come with me, I've got an idea,\" he grabbed Thorn by the arm and took her into the kitchen. He figured that she must eat anything piece by piece, so he tripped her into a chair and grabbed a bunch of food out of the icebox and put it on a tray. \"Let's see you screw up eating this,\" he said, handing her the tray. \"Carter, we've got news, I just heard Hojun say that Leo Abo-------I mean Leaboo was on the lookout for Thorn. He'll be able to recognize her by her sunburn. Which means, if we go out in public, she's dead meat,\" Lee explained. \"Shit! Does anybody else know about her?\" Carter asked. \"A couple of people, but Hojun said that he hired them to keep him informed incase we suddenly became indisposed, or was it decomposed?\" Lee responded. \"Allright look, it don't even matter anymore, I'll go get Thorn and we'll take her down to see Hojun and see what we have to do next,\" Carter suggested, \"Just get up, and let's go, we've gotta go meet with Hojun.\" End of chapter 3[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 A/N: Here's chapter 4, sorry for the delay and thanks to Dawnspirit for making me realize I was behind on the story. Back in the underground hideout. \"Man, this place just get crappier by the minute!\" Carter complained. \"Shutup and move,\" Lee said, grabbing Carter by his necktie. \"Hojun,\" Thorn said. \"Nice to see that you're still alive Thorn, for many people it has been an impossibility to escape Leaboo,\" Hojun turned around. \"Believe me, it wasn't easy,\" Lee returned. \"Shutup!\" Carter said. \"So, what've we gotta do until Leaboo's caught?\" Thorn asked. \"You have to keep an eye on the emerald, wherever it is, you know very well why Leaboo's after it,\" Hojun told her. \"Got it, I know where it is and it ain't leaving,\" Thorn replied. \"Thorn, go with Marie for a moment, these two will catch up with you in a minute,\" Hojun said. \"Shoot, what's up Hojun?\" Carter asked. \"A word of advice Carter, try and keep your patience with Thorn, she does not like strangers and will normally do anything to get them out of her life,\" Hojun advised them. \"Hojun, I have been around many a children before, they always act that way,\" Lee said, \"it's part of being a juvenile 'deliquence.\" \"Yeah, they always do that,\" Carter said. \"Not like she will, I know, she attempted anything and everything when I watched her to get rid of me,\" Hojun explained. \"You watched her?\" Lee asked. \"Shortly after Leaboo disappeared the last time we saw him, that was several years ago, and through times, she has just gotten worse, so I wish you good luck. The both of you will need it after you get back with her tonight,\" Hojun said. \"You really think so?\" Carter asked. \"I know so,\" he replied. \"Yeah? Well I think I can handle a 14-year-old girl by myself, without your help, let's grab the kid and go, Lee,\" Carter said. So, they grabbed Thorn and took her back to the apartment, however, it appeared that Hojun was wrong about her. She fell down on the couch and dozed off. \"About time too, she's been getting on my damn nerves all day,\" Carter complained. \"If that's the case, then just think of how she'll be tonight when she wakes up,\" Lee said. \"By the time she wakes up, I'm going to be so dog gone tired I won't be able to hear her,\" Carter replied. Want a bet? Within an hour, Thorn got up, went over to the sterio system and shook up the entire building. Carter and Lee came out of the bedroom with their forefingers in their ears, Lee started yelling, but his voice couldn't be heard over the music. \"Thorn! You've gotta turn that music down, it's too loud!\" Lee yelled. \"What?\" \"The music is too loud! You've gotta turn it down!\" Lee repeated. \"Sorry Lee, I can't hear you, I've gotta turn the music down,\" Thorn replied. \"Now what is it?\" \"Thorn, do you ever rest?\" Carter asked. \"Sometimes, when I feel like it,\" Thorn answered. \"Yeah whatever, look, if you don't mind we'd like to keep things down to a dull roar,\" Carter said. \"Don't worry, you guys won't bug me,\" Thorn replied. \"That's not what we meant Thorn,\" Lee said. \"I know, I know, but hey, I gotta have a sense of humor you know,\" Thorn returned. \"Look, we've gotta go talk to the police for a few minutes, can you stay out of trouble for a while?\" Lee asked. \"Sure, and if I'm lying, may I be your next partner in the LAPD,\" Thorn said to Carter. \"I guess we can trust you with that promise,\" Carter said. Lee and Carter left, and Thorn cranked the music back up again. \"Listen Captain Turmoil, Thorn is anything but normal,\" Carter explained at the office. \"She's also anything but stupid Carter, you check her police record, she hasn't even gotten one yet. But if she did, it would be marked with arson, disturbing the peace, robbery, domestic behavior, and weapon possession. She has burnt down 68 public schools, 56 police stations, 11 homes, 27 hospitals and 38 buildings all in the past four years. And all because there were people she didn't like,\" Captain Turmoil said. Carter took out a pad of paper and a pen, he decided to do the math. \"11 homes +27 hospitals +38 buildings +56 police stations +68 public schools =200 properties destroyed,\" Carter said. \"And each place's owner had filed $100,000 for the damage,\" Turmoil added. \"What? $20,000,000 for what a teenager did?\" Carter asked. \"And that's not all of it, then there's the medical bills of all the people she's injured. She's thrashed and choked and slapped 70 cops, 85 schoolteachers, 275 gang members, 38 college jocks, 48 irresponsible parents, and she attempted shooting one man just for smoking,\" Turmoil said. \"That's just crazy! Truly psychotic,\" Carter said. \"Exactly what we said,\" Turmoil replied. \"Look, Captain, I don't know if I can have a destructive delinquent in my house,\" Carter realized. \"Carter, you remember what Hojun said, if we do not take this case, we're fired,\" Lee said. Carter sighed, they agreed to keep an eye on Thorn, so they rushed back to the apartment and found a note on the door. It read 'Looking for me? Try the exact door down the hall'. Taking the note seriously, Carter and Lee checked out the apartment across the hall from them. Lee started knocking on the door, but then he wound up knocking on Thorn's nose. \"Hey! What is it?\" \"What is it?\" Lee asked. \"What is it? Nothing,\" Carter looked behind him. \"Nothing, we'll see you later,\" Lee said. \"Hold it!\" Cater said. \"What?\" Thorn asked. \"What are you doing over here?\" Lee asked. \"Shoot, I'm staying over here until Leaboo's butt is in jail, I figure, two---six years max,\" Thorn said. \"Thorn, the whole reason why we were looking for you's because you've gotta stay with us,\" Carter asked. \"Allright, just give me some time to move my stuff back in,\" Thorn said. \"Good, and in the mean time, Lee and I'll bamboozle some grub, Lee, go get a bottle,\" Carter told him. Lee started off on one foot, but his other one stopped immediately. \"You know how hard it is to get a bottle in these towns,\" Lee said. \"Soda you dumbass,\" Carter said. \"Ohhhhhhhh,\" Lee replied. \"You get the soda, I'll get a pizza,\" Carter said. \"And I'll get a frying pan ready for Leaboo's men when he sends them up,\" Thorn added. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, let's get going Lee,\" Carter said. By the time they got back, it had gotten extremely dark, Carter opened the door a crack to get his hand through. He felt for the light switch, he found it, but it was dead. He and Lee stomped in and looked around, the rooms were dark, and everything had been trashed, but then they saw a light in the back room, they decided to check it out. Thorn was in the room with a gun in her hand, she had it cocked and was ready to fire. \"Hey, what's going on in here?\" Carter asked, walking in. Too late, Thorn had pulled the trigger, Carter fell to the floor as a suction cup dart hit the wall, Lee came in laughing at Carter's misery. \"Tha's funny, you scared of a toy gun,\" Lee laughed. He wasn't laughing for long either, when Thorn pulled the trigger again, he dropped to the floor too, another dart hit the wall. \"Thorn, what is the idea of this? We thought someone had broke in here,\" Carter said. \"I decided to have a little fun, so I took out my dart gun,\" Thorn replied. She took it out, it was a bright green plastic dart gun with a black lever in the back for installing darts. Carter was starting to get fed up with her, and blurted out the first somewhat bright idea he'd had all day. \"Thorn, go take a bath,\" Carter said. \"Allright,\" Thorn put her gun away, \"where's the washing machine?\" \"Over there,\" Lee pointed. \"That's gotta be the cleanest juvenile delinquent I've ever seen,\" Carter said. \"Maybe, I think we better keep a close eye on her tonight,\" Lee added. \"Yeah, I suppose, hey that reminds me, when we came in, what happened to the anchovy pizza?\" Carter asked. \"Uh Carter,\" Lee looked up. \"Don't 'Uh Carter' me, I want an answer and I want it now,\" Carter said. He got it, the pizza fell off the ceiling and onto him. \"Man, I hate anchovies in my hair!\" Carter complained. After Carter spent half an hour getting anchovies and pizza sauce out of his hair, Lee decided to find something else to do, so he went to do his laundry. He took his dirty clothes out of the basket, and opened the lid, he realized that the washer was already full of water and suds. He reached down into it and felt something, he pulled the object up and realized it was Thorn! \"Thorn! What are you doing in the washer? \"I'm taking a bath just like Carter told me to do, what're you doing?\" she asked. \"I'm trying to do my laundry,\" Lee yelled. \"Well then you'll have to wait a while, I'm on a light load at the moment,\" Thorn replied. \"No kidding, Carter!\" Lee yelled. \"What is it now, Lee?\" Carter asked, rushing in. \"You told Thorn to take a bath, and she's in the washing machine,\" Lee exclaimed. \"Yeah, and these razor blades are dull,\" Thorn added. \"Thorn, step out of the washer right now, right now!\" Carter told her. \"Fine,\" Thorn stepped out in a baggy T-shirt and large surfing shorts, with flippers on her feet. \"Well now ain't that a sight to see?\" Carter asked. \"I don't know, is it?\" Thorn asked. \"Thorn, get out of this gear and get ready for a whooping,\" Carter said. \"Forget it, I'm not going anywhere and that's that,\" Thorn replied. \"Oh really?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You two need a room?\" Lee asked. \"Shutup, Lee!\" they said. \"Allright, that does it, go put on some regular clothes, and I'm going to see to it that you ain't going anywhere, do you hear me?\" Carter asked. \"Yeah, I understand,\" Thorn replied. \"Good, now get,\" Carter said. Thorn took off like the wind, of course it helped once she got her flippers off. End of chapter 4[Chapter 5] \"Carter, why are you being so mean to her today? She did nothing to you Tuesday, last night, or today, that you should be this mad at her,\" Lee realized. \"I've got my reasons for being strict with her, Lee, you don't see me pulling a belt on her, or whooping her till she can't walk. But that kid gets on my damn nerves all the time, she drives me crazy,\" Carter replied. \"Carter, she did nothing to you that you would not have done to her,\" Lee told him. \"Exactly why I'm mad at her, because I didn't get a chance to do anything to her, now, clean this mess up, and comb your tongue, and don't let me catch her in the washing machine again,\" Carter screamed. \"Stop screaming at me!\" Lee yelled. \"I'm not screaming!\" Carter walked away. A short while later, Thorn came back in the room. \"Well, are you through playing cowboys and Indians or what?\" Thorn asked. \"That does it, go to bed!\" Carter yelled. \"Only if you do too!\" Thorn said. \"Carter, it's the only way,\" Lee said. \"Allright, allright, but you better not try anything in the middle of the night,\" Carter told her. \"Deal.\" The next morning, Lee came out of his room looking mad. \"Why're you so steamed, Lee?\" Carter asked. \"Because, last night, you slept like an offspring, I stayed up half the night with Thorn watching 'American Gladiators',\" Lee explained, \"she decided to try everything she saw on me. And furthermore, everything, was going fine, until the joust.\" \"The joust? What the hell's a joust?\" Carter asked. \"Joust is----when two people stand on pedestals and try to throw each other off by using poles,\" Lee said. \"Well then we don't have a problem, we don't have pedestals,\" Carter laughed. \"That may be true, but we do have a fire escape,\" Lee said. \"You mean Thorn threw you out onto the fire escape?\" \"Not on it, Carter, down it, she pushed me down the steps, and I started rolling, and you know we're twenty stories up,\" Lee explained. \"Oof, so you rolled down 40,000 steps?\" Carter asked. \"Not exactly, I came to a short stop when the fire escape broke. So, I jump onto window, I ask lady if I can come in, she slaps me with wet towel and call me 'Peeping Tom'. I know no Peeping Tom. So, I jump over to next window, I ask I can come in, lady throws bucket of water on me. Then I jump over to the next window, I ask if I can come in, lady puts kitty kat out for the night. \"So, I jump over to building ledge, and climb up rain gutter until rain gutter break, then I climb up building wall by pulling out bricks. Which is why you now have nice draft and view, in the east wing of the building,\" Lee explained. \"Well hello, Lee, how're you today?\" Thorn asked. \"Thorn, remind me never to joust with you again,\" Lee told her. \"If you insist, spoil sport,\" she replied. \"Thorn.\" \"Okay, Carter, now that you know what I did with your little Asian friend, I'm ready for ya, go ahead and start yelling, I'm waiting,\" Thorn said, holding her shoe as if ready to throw it. \"Now look, Thorn, Lee told about what you did last night, how you threw him down the fire escape and he went from window to window to ledge, up the broken rain gutter, and pulled down the bricks. Nice going back there.\" \"Run that by me again?\" Thorn threw down her shoe. \"I have been trying to get back at Lee for so many things in the past few months you would not believe! And you---------clear out of the blue, come and do a thing like this, it's brilliant!\" Carter laughed. \"Does this mean you don't hate me?\" Thorn asked. \"Hate you?\" Carter asked, \"I love you!\" Carter picked Thorn up off her feet and gave her a real wet kiss on the cheek. \"Patooey! The last time I got a kiss like that was when I ran into a lovesick jaguar,\" Thorn spitted. \"Carter, Hojun wants us to meet him again, and bring Thorn along too,\" Lee said. So, Carter, Lee, and Thorn went out to Carter's car, hopped in and took off. \"I don't get it, why'd Hojun have to move his hideaway to somewhere else?\" Carter asked. \"That way, if Leaboo found them out, they could continue their research without having their equipment blown up,\" Thorn explained. \" Yeah, and that's also a good way to avoid getting your brains blown out of your head as well,\" Carter added. Out of the blue, a car going the other way on the street nearly collided with them, Carter stuck his head out and yelled, \"watch it punk bitch before I run you over!\" \"Carter, slow down or we'll get run over!\" Thorn yelled. Carter parked the car and got out to head to the hideaway, Lee stopped in the middle of the street on top of a manhole cover. \"There it is,\" Lee pointed. \"We're going to the sewer?\" Carter asked. \"Not exactly,\" Thorn lifted the manhole cover and started to climb down, Lee and Carter followed. As soon as they reached the bottom of the ladder, bright blue lights lit the path to Hojun. \"What's the report on Leaboo?\" Thorn asked. \"So far, we have not been able to catch him, furthermore to make things worse, no one has seen him since yesterday, we fear he might be closer than we think, but we are not sure,\" Hojun explained. Lee watched the expression on Hojun's face, he knew something was up, which did not involve Thorn being there. \"Thorn, go wait in the next room, we'll catch up in a minute,\" Lee told her. After Thorn left, Hojun had a word with Carter and Lee. \"Keep an eye on her until we get this thing blown over, don't let her out of your sight. Leaboo's up to something, I know because when he plots something, he lays low for a while. So obviously he's working on something, otherwise we wouldn't have been this fortunate to go through a day without an injury,\" Hojun explained. \"Do not worry, we'll keep an eye on her,\" Lee returned. \"There's only one thing I wanna know,\" Carter brought up. \"What's that?\" Hojun asked. \"How come she's blue if she's sun burnt?\" Carter returned. \"Follow me, I will show you,\" Hojun said. Hojun led them into another room, it was filled with a bunch of odd looking items. \"So what's all this?\" Carter asked. Carter and Lee turned to face a wall and saw an old film dated a few years back. \"What's this?\" \"This is the reason as to why Thorn appears the way she does to you,\" Hojun answered. On the screen, in the film, Leaboo came after Thorn and her father, Professor Strong. Leaboo choked the professor and threw him down thirty feet against the hard metal floor of the laboratory he was working in, killing him instantly. Then he went after Thorn, chasing her around the laboratory, she put up an extreme fight. \"So this is the deal? Moby Dick killed her father and tried to kill her?\" Carter asked. \"She was eight years old at the time, she knew what he was up to and tried to escape,\" Hojun said. They watched as Leaboo shoved Thorn off the fourth floor and into a vat of lye. \"What's this?\" Lee asked. \"That toxic contains many deadly chemicals, she survived somehow. But because of the many after effects they contain, it left a mark on her, scarring her for life. Every time she gets burnt, the area turns bright blue, so he could find her to track her down and kill her. And now, today, he has tried again, the man sitting in the passenger side of Leaboo's car was his half brother Spark. Somehow, Thorn managed to figure out how to do away with him, Leaboo hired him as a hit man to kill all three of you. But obviously she caught on faster than to be expected,\" Hojun explained. \"Anything else we should know about this Leaboo guy other than he's hazardous and an idiot?\" Carter asked. \"Yes, look out, he and his men carry a red toxic. It contains a rare acid, it will effect anything, but it will only eat away at human skin. So far this is no known way to make it harmless or minimize its effects, when the time came, Leaboo used it for his choice weapon on Thorn. But she managed to escape from him before it could hit, now, however, he will try again unless you stop him,\" Hojun said. \"So I get it now, this whole thing's just a big game to Moby Dick,\" Carter realized. \"Very good, now you understand your mission,\" Hojun said. \"Yeah, I understand, I also understand I got some explaining to do, come on Lee, let's get Thorn and scram,\" Carter said. \"We will return if anything else comes up,\" Lee said. \"Come on Lee, I want to beat the rats to the top,\" Carter called. \"You're crazy, there haven't been any rats down here for twelve years,\" Thorn said. After climbing up back onto the ground, night had already appeared, the sky was dark blue, the towns were full of bright lights off buildings, and traffic was busy everywhere. \"I've been doing some thinking, if Leaboo knew where we all were at the same time, we'd probably be sitting ducks just waiting to be shot,\" Thorn said. \"That makes sense, so what you're saying is that two of us should go one way, and the other one of us should go in a different direction, and we'll all meet back at the apartment,\" Carter thought. \"For once you're actually using your brain,\" Thorn laughed, \"which is why I did a little hot-wiring.\" So, Carter and Thorn headed back one way and Lee headed the other way. Carter looked at Thorn from the rear view mirror, looking like she did the day she arrived, miserable. \"I'm sorry, Thorn.\" \"About what?\" \"Everything.\" \"I don't understand,\" she replied. \"I'm talking about everything I've been doing in the last two days, it was your first time here and all I did was treat you like shit.\" \"My grandmother treats garbage better than that,\" she said. \"Well look, Thorn, sometimes, when people get frustrated, they explode at kids at times and don't even realize it,\" Carter started. \"Well why in the hell are you being so nasty to me? I never did anything that bad,\" Thorn said. \"You wanna know why?\" \"Yeah.\" \"A ratty teenager killed my father,\" Carter said. \"No.\" \"Yeah, and back then, to both of us, teenagers were allright, but one day, my daddy was catching a fifteen-year-old punk speeding, pulled him over to give him a ticket. The punk shot him then and there, clear dead and in broad daylight, no one came to get the kid, so he ran free for a long time, if I had a chance to get even with that punk, I'd,\" Carter said. \"Man, no wonder you're steamed, now I know why you hate me, if a kid killed my father, I'd be hating me too,\" Thorn sighed. \"I don't hate you, Thorn,\" Carter replied. \"Oh yes you do, all those times you yelled in my eardrums like that,\" Thorn responded, slapping Carter in the back of the head. \"Oof, well look, I'm sorry for yelling at you even though you never did anything,\" Carter said. \"Apology accepted, it's the first one I've gotten in three years,\" Thorn replied. \"You know, Thorn? I think this could be a beautiful thing in disguise,\" Carter thought. \"Pretty good disguise, if you ask me,\" she said. Carter looked in the mirror again and saw a car tailing behind them, it couldn't have been Lee, and the driver was closing in pretty fast, so---------------------Leaboo! \"Shit, Thorn, duck down,\" he said. \"What?\" \"Duck down, someone's tailing in,\" he said. Thorn flattened herself down in the back of the car as the driver closed in, the driver was closing in on the side. He pulled out a handgun and aimed at Carter's head, but without taking his eyes off the road, Carter pulled out one of his guns and fired the man in the hand. \"Now that's gonna be nasty tomorrow morning,\" Thorn said. Not long after losing the hitman, Carter parked the car in the residents' parking lot. They managed to get home with their lives in tact, now hopefully they could say the same for Lee.[Chapter 6] Chapter 5 \"Boy oh boy, it don't look like nobody' home, I wonder if Lee's back yet,\" Carter said. \"Just pulled in, look,\" Thorn pointed. \"Don't point, don't you know that's not polite?\" \"What do you care? It's 12:00 at night, everything's dark,\" she replied. At that, Lee came from around the corner of the building to face them. \"Carter, one of Leaboo's men cut me off on the road and tried to kill me,\" Lee informed. \"I know, the same thing happened to us,\" Carter replied. \"I don't think it's safe to be here anymore,\" Lee said. \"Don't be ridiculous, they've already been shot, what more trouble can they do?\" Thorn asked. \"Besides, they'd be expecting us to leave, as long as we're up here, we're safe,\" Carter said, as they got off the elevator. \"I say we stay up here, we can watch to see if anyone's coming,\" Thorn suggested. \"Thorn, Lee and I need to talk in private,\" Carter said. \"Fine, I'll go into the living room and watch the late, late, late early show,\" Thorn said sarcastically. \"Lee, I can't say the same for you, but we can't take a chance on leaving Thorn alone anymore than necessary,\" Carter said. \"I'm aware, Carter, but if we take her everyplace we do, Leaboo will catch on,\" Lee replied. While they had their conversation, Thorn was in the living room watching 'Bat & Brawl', an old 3 Stooge cartoon, set back during the French Revolution. The 3 Stooges were soldiers, keeping a top-secret message away from a vampire, Count Duncula. \"Ow! He got me on the ear!\" Curly Joe exclaimed. Thorn watched as Duncula bit and flew away with the message in his teeth. \"Hey Thorn! We're gonna, what is this?\" Carter asked. \"Channel 47 is having an all night vampire marathon,\" Thorn replied. Carter turned to face Thorn and almost fell down laughing, she was standing on her head upside-down on the couch, with her arms spread out like vampire wings. \"Whatever, I think all this commotion's got you batty,\" Carter said. Carter left into the next room to talk with Lee, just as he did, a hand reached for Thorn from behind the curtains. However, she already noticed it, she screamed loud enough for Carter and Lee to hear her. They rushed into the living room to see her fighting with a man three times her own size, Carter picked up a lamp and bashed him over the head with it. However, it hardly effected him at all, he started yelling at them, but while he was doing that, Thorn sneaked up behind him and bit him on the neck, just like a vampire. The man gasped and dropped to the floor, dead, possibly. \"Thorn, what do you think you're doing?\" Carter asked. Thorn spit out two of her teeth, or so it seemed, Lee picked them up and realized what they were. \"These look like transparent gel teeth, what they're used for I don't know,\" he explained. \"Thorn, what's the deal?\" Carter asked. \"Carter, look!\" Thorn yelled. Carter's eyes bugged out as the man's body dissolved, starting with the bite marks on his neck, until it completely dissolved, leaving a metal skeleton. \"He was a robot?\" \"Leaboo seeks my demise through every trick in the book, even this stuff...Artificial skin was used to cover his metal body, therefore, people would assume he's human. But, the acid will eat away at just about any skin,\" Thorn explained. \"Thorn, you mean, you already knew about the acid?\" Lee asked. \"Yeah, I managed to get ahold of some of it, and implanted it in the teeth, Hojun's men sometimes invent new weapons and other equipment for self defense, especially since Leaboo came around. Normally they're used for injecting arsenic or something...I bite down on someone's skin, and the acid is injected into them...it's very dangerous, but I figured, if anyone got near me, I'd bite them, and...anyway I better go get something to clean up this mess,\" Thorn left. Carter eyed Lee that he got the point, he was to follow her and make sure that nothing else happened. Meanwhile, Carter got to work in disposing of the titanium steel body. Thorn approached a small storage room down on the first floor, and went through all the bottled liquids and chemicals kept there, and one by one, she pitched them. \"Cooking fat, *toss* glue remover, *toss* whip cream, *toss* perfume, *toss* phooey.\" Little did Thorn know however, that while Lee was watching her behind a shelf, someone outside of the room was carrying a bottle of the red acid, the lid had been removed and was ready to be thrown. \"Nope, nope, nope, nope, trizoac acid, nope.\" Thorn tossed the bottle of acid and it hit the red bottle, smashing it right on the man's hand, he screamed and ran away. \"What was that?\" Thorn turned around. \"Someone was trying to kill you with acid, but when you threw the trizoic acid, he ran because both bottles smashed on his hand,\" Lee explained. \"Lee, you moron! Don't you know what trizoic acid does? It blows up! Why in the hell didn't it do it just now!?\" Thorn asked. \"I don't know, but the main thing is, he's gone now,\" Lee told her. Great, now what'll we do?\" Thorn asked. \"Follow me.\" \"Where're we going?\" \"Doctor.\" \"I don't need no doctor, Lee,\" Thorn replied. \"No but you will,\" Lee returned. \"I'm not going anywhere with you,\" Thorn said. \"Trust me, I know what I'm doing,\" Lee said. \"You always say that and you're never right,\" Thorn replied. \"So? Something right has to happen to me sooner or later,\" Lee said. \"Yeah, well the day that happens to you is the day I bite--\" With that, Thorn got conked out by a falling light, she later woke up in what looked like a hospital. Struggling to get up, she saw two syringes filled with a liquid, at first she assumed it was acid, but there was a bottle next to her full of it, it read, DEMORAL. Jittery by the sight of it, Thorn threw the bottle into the air, causing it to crash on the floor, a masked doctor walked in. \"Hey doc, what am I in for?\" Thorn asked. \"You're in because you got knocked out by a falling object two days ago,\" he replied. \"Two days? Man, it sure seems like longer than that,\" Thorn said. The doctor went over to Thorn's bed and placed one hand on her head to flatten her down. \"What're you doing?\" she asked. \"Relax, I'm going to give you an injection that will help you rest,\" he said. Thorn eyed the needle and realized it was the Demoral, she kicked it out of his hand and screamed. Carter and Lee came rushing in through the door, Carter pulled out his gun and pointed it at the doctor while Lee helped Thorn out of the bed. They ran out in the middle of the hospital and started yelling, that got all the doctors, nurses, gurneys and wheelchairs out of the other room and into the main hallway. Carter took out his gun again and started yelling in a foreign language to the nurses. The three rushed out into the middle of rush hour traffic and dove into their car to getaway. Lee put the key in the ignition, and they tore out of there. \"You know what, Carter?\" Thorn asked. \"What? \"I didn't know you spoke Portuguese.\" \"I don't,\" Carter realized. \"I can vouch for that, he just told the nurses to 'go out in the street during traffic, and yell 'chicken'!\" Lee replied. \"Where'd you learn how to speak Portuguese?\" Carter asked. \"I took it up in night school,\" Lee explained. \"Never mind, let's just get out of here before we're blown all over the street,\" Thorn said. \"Yeah, we can kill each other later,\" Carter added. \"Well, let's go,\" Lee said, making a right turn. Lee parked the car and they headed up to their apartment, Carter noticed Thorn seemed unbalanced and lightheaded. \"Thorn, what the hell all happened in the hospital? One of the damn doctors mess you up or something?\" Carter asked. \"I don't know...how long was I even there?\" Thorn quietly asked. \"A couple of hours, we were in the waiting room expecting the doctor to ex'plain your condition,\" Lee started. \"Then we heard you screaming and went in to see what the hell was going on,\" Carter said. \"He must've been one of Leaboo's men, he was trying to put me under with Demoral,\" Thorn explained. As Thorn seated herself on the couch to rest, the phone rang and Carter answered, it was Hojun, he needed to speak with them again, but this time they couldn't bring Thorn. Carter agreed and told him he and Lee would arrive shortly, then he hung up. \"Who was 'dat?\" Lee asked. \"Hojun, we have to see him again, he said to keep you here, so stay out of trouble if possible, Thorn,\" Carter said. \"Are you kidding? You sound as if you don't trust me,\" she replied. \"We don't!\" Thorn quickly became unsteady and passed out, hitting the floor in her fall, Carter picked her up while Lee rambled on like the idiot he was. \"What do we do?\" he asked. \"Go get a bottle,\" Carter said. \"Right,\" Lee took off on one foot and spun back around on the other. \"Hey, you know how hard it is to get a bottle in this town,\" Lee said. \"Water ya idiot,\" Carter replied. \"Ohhhhhhhh,\" Lee said. Thorn slowly started moving and finally opened her eyes, \"Forget the water,\" Thorn said, \"make it a 96, on the rocks.\" \"What?\" Carter asked. Thorn laid rested against Carter, she started shaking and mumbling in obvious confusion. \"Ohhhhhhhh, mammy, it's your dear boy Sammy, coming home from Alabamy, so put on those eggs and hammy, don't flim flam me mammy,\" Thorn muttered. \"Give me that bottle of water,\" Carter said. Lee went into the kitchen and came back out with a bottle of ice-water, and handed it to Carter. He took the bottle and poured it on Thorn, she jumped for the ceiling. \"Carter!\" she screamed, \"What the hell was that for!?!\" \"To get you back to normal, if that's even possible,\" Carter replied, \"Did it work?\" Thorn dropped down from the ceiling and back on her feet, \"I...guess so...thanks.\" \"Maybe that doctor did screw with you in the hospital,\" Lee said. Carter and Thorn stared at Lee with confused glares. \"Not like that!\" Lee said, realizing what they thought, \"you know what I mean!\" \"I don't think he did,\" Thorn replied, \"I'm just tired...I just want to lay down and....oh.....\" \"What?\" Carter asked. \"Nothing, I just remembered how that sentence usually ended...and I don't want to die anytime soon,\" Thorn replied. \"So Thorn, do you think you can stay here alone for a while and not cause any trouble?\" Carter asked. \"What do I look like, Dennis the Menace? I'll be fine, you two go on, see what Hojun needs, come back, and we'll put together a plan for Leaboo, now go on, get going,\" Thorn said as she tried shoving them out of the door. \"Allright, we'll go, just remember, stay out of trouble!\" Carter said. \"Or else what?\" Thorn asked. \"What do you mean or else what?\" Carter asked. \"What will you do if I don't?\" Thorn asked. \"Thorn, if you get into any more trouble today, I'll introduce you to the rest of the LAPD when I get back!\" Carter said. Recently, everyone back there had become an extreme pain in the ass according to Carter, so he knew someone like Thorn would go crazy if she had to be around them. \"Yeah...then I won't!\" Thorn said. \"Good,\" Carter said. \"Fine,\" Thorn replied. \"Fine,\" Carter repeated. \"Good!\" Thorn slammed the door in Carter and Lee's faces. \"Well, now that that's settled, let's go see what Hojun wants,\" Carter said.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Carter and Lee woke upnand found themselves in a large, bright room, and they foundnthemselves chained to the wall. \"Carter!\" Leenshouted as everything came into focus. \"What is it now,nLee?\" Carter asked. \"How did we get intonthis mess?\" \"We went to seenHojun, and, damn, that's all I remember,\" Carter recalled. \"Where the hell arenwe?\" Lee asked. Carter looked aroundnand didn't know what to make of their surroundings. There werengurneys covered in dry blood, piles of old bones, discarded rustednpipes, and vats of lye and other concoctions. \"Shit, how the hellnare we going to get out of here?\" Carter asked. Carter looked up andnsaw their wrists were constrained by old handcuffs, in fact theynlooked ready to fall apart if giving the right jerk. Lee did the samenand his cuffs broke and his stepped down, Carter struggled in his,nwrithing in the cuffs, while Lee came to a conclusion. \"Now I remember,\"nLee said, \"we went to see Hojun, and Leaboo's men knocked usnout.\" \"Oh really?\" Carternasked as the cuffs broke, \"I never would've guessed.\" \"Somehow he must havenconvinced us that he was Hojun so we would leave\" \"THORN!\" theynexclaimed in unison. \"Shit, Leaboonprobably has her by now!\" Carter said, \"Shit, what do we do now?\" They heard a loud,nfemale, almost inhuman scream submerge from somewhere among theirnsurroundings. \"It's Thorn! She'snalive!\" Lee said. \"But for how long?\"nCarter asked, \"We've got to get out of here and find her!\" They soon realized thatnthe problem was coming to them, they heard two heavy sets ofnfootsteps from above, then slowly made their way down, all the whilenassociated with Thorn's screams. \"They're comingndown here, we've got to act fast,\" Lee said. \"How?\" Carternrealized that sometime during his blackout, his gun had been removednfrom his pocket. The door opened, andnThorn was led in by a tall man with bruises all over his neck andnaround his eyes, and Thorn had a gash on her forehead and severalngashes, bruises, and burn marks on her body. \"Carter!\" shencried. \"Shut up!\" the mannsaid as he shoved her in, and locked the door behind him. \"Thorn!\" \"Carter!\" \"Shut up!\" The man struck Thornnwith his fist, knocking her down, and she slid across the room untilnshe hit her head on the wheels of a gurney. She ran her hands overnthe back of her head, then on her forehead and down her face, whichnby now was stained with blood and tears. \"Carter!\" shenpitifully cried again. Carter ran over tonThorn and knelt beside her, she held out her arms for him to help hernup. \"Oh shit, Thorn,\"nhe said as he observed the damage done to her. \"Carter!\" shenchoked on a sob. \"Shut up!\" the mannsaid, \"Leaboo will have his way with you before this is over. Andnyou better obey him.\" \"Man, shut the hellnup with that bullshit!\" Carter said, \"You gone and done all thisnto her, she has a right to scream by now, I'm damn surprised shenhadn't broken the windows to this damn place.\" Carter picked Thorn upnand held her in his arms against his chest as his eyes scanned everynangle of the room they were in, looking for a way out. It seemedntheir best choice was to kill the man and steal his keys. \"You say that now,\"nthe man said, \"just wait until Leaboo gets down here. I'll benglad to report this to him.\" \"Too bad you won'tnhave that chance,\" Lee came up to the man and kicked him in thenchest. The man fell backnagainst the wall and pulled out his gun and fired at Lee, who dodgednevery bullet. When the man fired the last bullet, he threw the gun atnLee, who dodged that too, and picked up it when it hit the ground.nThe man threw himself at Lee and pinned him to the ground, andnstarted beating him. Carter leaned Thornnagainst the wall and stood up, \"Stay here,\" he said as he wentnover to them. Carter picked the man off Lee and punched him in thenface, sending him back. Lee got up and went at him again, but the manngrabbed him and threw him at Carter, knocking both of them onto thenground. Lee and Carter looked up and saw the man standing over themnwhen something jabbed him in the gut. Thorn was standing across himnwith one of the pipes in hand and swung at him. He missed it and ranntowards the wall and picked up another pipe and matched her swing fornswing. Suddenly the tablesnturned and the man started forcing Thorn back, she kept retreatingnuntil she got to a beam leading up to near the ceiling, and the mannfollowed. Soon, Thorn found herself at a dead end, below her was anvat of acid, the same red acid that was almost used on her yesterday.nThorn found herself trapped, she was between the henchman and thenacid, with no way out. Lee and Carter got upnand tried to get up to the beam to help her, but by that time, it wasntoo late. The man swung and Thorn jumped, missing it. The man steppednforward to strike her again and instead she shoved him with her pipenand he fell into the acid. \"Oh shit!\" Carternsaid as they watched the man's flash eaten away by the acid. \"What do you know?\"nLee asked, \"'Is just like the joust on American Gladiators.\" \"Carter!\" Thornnpitifully screamed. \"It's okay, Thorn,nhe's dead now, you can come on down, and we'll get the hell outnof here,\" Carter said. \"Carter behind you!\" Carter heard a gun firenand a body fall to the ground, he turned around and saw Lee on thenfloor with his hand on his chest, and Leaboo entering the room. \"Well, well, well,\"nCarter said, \"if it ain't Mister Big Ol' Nasty Ass, stillntaking pleasure in hurting a little kid?\" \"Carter!\" Leengasped, \"don't be an idiot.\" \"It ends here,\"nLeaboo said. \"You're damn rightnit is,\" Carter said. Before Carter could donanything else, he heard the gun fire again, and this time, he fell tonthe floor. \"Shit,\" he hissed. Leaboo removed thencartridge from his gun and put in another as he laughed, \"Six yearsnago, I killed Professor Strong, now you two. It only makes sense,nanyone who's cared for that girl ends up dead. She's simply ancurse, and there's only one way to end a curse,\" he said as henstared at Thorn, who was now across the room from him, \"sever itsnlife.\" \"You're a sickassndude, you know that?\" Carter asked. He didn't have timento answer, a bullet entered his chest and went out through his backnand he fell on the floor, his gun fell beside him and his eyelidsnclosed. Carter and Lee lookednover and saw Thorn holding a smoking, very much real gun, paintednbright green, exactly like her dart gun. Sirens were heard andnthrough the windows above blue lights were seen, Thorn ran over tonLee and Carter, \"Carter, my God, are you going to be okay?\" \"Yeah, I think we gotnlucky this time,\" Carter said, \"how about you, Lee?\" Lee lowered his handnfrom his chest, revealing no sign of injury or penetration from anbullet, or even blood for that matter. The bullet had missed him, butnhe still had open injuries from the fight. \"We got damn luckynthis time,\" Lee said. \"And now, it's allnover,\" Carter said, \"all this shit over one emerald, and we don'tnhave the slightest idea where in hell it is.\" \"Yes we do, Thorn hasnit,\" Lee said. \"No I don't,\"nThorn said as she lowered her gun. \"Yes you do,\" Leensaid as he clutched the gun, \"right inside your gun.\" The bodies were takennto the morgue, and Carter, Lee, and Thorn were rushed to thenhospital. While they were there, Thorn explained that Hojun had givennher the gun with the emerald placed in the handle, so she had beenncarrying it on her all along, and she had confided in Lee that shenwas carrying the emerald the entire time. It was also revealednthat when they had left to see Hojun, he had called them down to thenhideout, but Leaboo caught them first, then while they werenunconscious, he had gone to their apartment and kidnapped here. Thennwhile they were locked in the room down below, she was kept innanother room very similar, and Leaboo had left, leaving a henchman inncharge, he demanded the location to the emerald, but when she refusednto tell him, he beat her severely. In fact, when she was taken downnto the room Lee and Carter were in, she was being taken down there toneither finally divulge the emerald's location, or die. Carter and Lee werenboth recovering when Hojun came in. \"So, how are L.A.'s two topnofficers doing?\" \"You mean I'm stillnin the L.A.P.D. after all this?\" Carter huffed. \"And how, I spoke tonyour employers this morning, and they all agreed to keep you,nconsidering you unraveled a case that's been going on for six yearsnwith no success until now,\" he said. \"Wonderful,\" Carternsaid. \"And Lee.\" \"Yeah?\" \"You'll be happy tonknow that your services are still desired in Hong Kong.\" \"Oh good, I'll bengoing back soon.\" \"Before you do that,\"nThorn said, \"after you guys get out of here, could I take you to mynhome town first? Before we have to go our separate ways?\" \"Sure, why the hellnnot?\" Carter asked, \"I've been halfway around the globe by now,none more vacation shouldn't hurt.\" \"Good, I'll gonspeak with the doctor and see how long you'll be staying, then I'llnbe able to catch the next flight going out around that time.\" Thorn left the room andnheaded down the hall. Hojun went over to Carter's bed, \"You donrealize of course that now she'll need someone to look after her.\" \"Yeah…you see ifnyou can find a good place for her to stay,\" Carter said, \"I don'tncare how many injuries she's cost me, Leaboo was wrong as hell,nshe's not a curse.\" \"Well we'll have tonsee about relocating her with someone during the next few weeks, andnif it turns out we can't find anybody, we may have to put her in anfoster home,\" Hojun said. \"But I'm not going to tell her thatnnow, I'll let you three recover, then go on your trip, then find anway to tell her when you get back.\" Carter, Thorn and Leenwere released from the hospital after making a recovery in whatnseemed to be record time. They were at the airport waiting for theirnflight when Hojun showed up. \"Hey Hojun, what'snhappening?\" Carter asked. \"It's all over, thenemerald is back in its rightful location, Leaboo is buried, and thencase is officially closed. Just some minor paperwork from here onnout,\" Hojun took out a few papers, one with several lines at thenbottom, \"I just need you two to sign here.\" Lee and Carter putntheir signatures down on the paper. \"Hey man, it's toonbad about Thorn and all, not having anyone to look after her now,\"nCarter said. \"Oh we found her anhome.\" \"You did?\" Leenasked. \"Yep, she seems verynhappy about it too.\" \"I hope it's withnsomeone who likes her,\" Carter said. \"Believe me, it is,\"nHojun said as he put the papers into his pocket and walked off. Thorn walked back tonCarter and Lee, \"We'll be boarding soon, and Carter, I'm sorrynabout ruining your vacation here.\" \"You gotta be kiddingnme, this trip out here has been one of the best times in my life.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, so don'tnworry about it, everything's a'ight between us. Ain't thatnright, Lee?\" \"It certainly hasnbeen something,\" Lee said, \"but I don't think the police backnin Hong Kong will believe me when I tell them what happened.\" \"No problem, take menback with you, I'll tell them exactly how it went,\" Thorn toldnhim. \"Well Thorn, youncertainly did give us a very interesting vacation,\" Lee said, \"wencertainly won't forget our stay in New York.\" \"That's good tonknow,\" Thorn said. \"Hey Thorn, Hojunntold me about your new family, congratulations,\" Carter said. \"You mean it?\"nThorn asked. \"Yeah.\" \"Good, because now Inhave something to say,\" Thorn said. \"What's that?\"nCarter asked. Thorn threw herselfninto Carter's arms and yelled, \"Daddy!\" and planted a long, wetnkiss on his cheek. Lee stood beside himnand laughed, \"Congratulations, Carter.\" \"Ah, Daddy #2!\"nThorn moved from Carter to Lee and kissed him on the cheek as well. \"Wait a minute, whatndo you mean?\" Carter asked. \"I told Hojun that Indidn't want to live with anyone else, I wanted to live with yountwo, I know you like me,\" Thorn said. \"Well you can'tnargue with that,\" Lee said. \"True. Okay, I don'tnknow how we're going to pull this off, but I'm sure we'll findna way.\" \"Thank you Carter,\"nThorn said as she jumped back into his arms and put hers around hisnneck, \"I love you.\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,njust don't say that for everyone to hear, they might think we'rena bunch of damn perverts,\" Carter said. \"Come on, we betternget going if we want to catch our flight,\" Thorn said as she gotndown. They grabbed their bagsnand boarded the plane, took their seats and within a few minutes,nthey took off. \"So you live innBerlin?\" Carter asked. \"No, but this was thenonly flight heading out anywhere near my hometown,\" Thorn said,n\"you know Carter, I think you'll like it there. The women backnhome are dying to meet a nice man like you.\" \"Oh yeah? Where donyou live?\" Carter asked. \"Transylvania.\" \"WHAT!!?\" Carternexclaimed.

This particular book is based in the parallel universe that is called above the law in the 1940s (the parallel universe as established in my Austin & Ally and Jessie and Victorious fanfiction and this particular fanfiction is going to be part of a series). Originally when I wrote this story it was a disaster so here I am rewriting it. And out of interest I do not own the movies Doctor X and the Return of Doctor X or any of the characters even though the concept of the main character Doctor X is different to how he was in the movies (not just because he was a good guy in Doctor X and a bad guy in the Return of Doctor X) and some of the details in both of the movies have been changed to do with my book. Please read and review and I hope you enjoy the book. Chapter 1 introducing Walter On the 30th of October 1940 slightly before 9.00 AM in Brooklyn in New York City in a location near to the Brooklyn Bridge there is a giant building that looks like the French theatre the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux with a number of offices on top of it and the part that looks like the French theatre the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux was built the year after the last year of the American Revolutionary War in 1784 and it was opened in 1785 and originally was used as a theatre and it was designed by a man called Victor Louis to copy his French theatre the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux that was completed in 1780 and at the moment the particular building is being used for a local newspaper that has been going since 1852 when it was founded by a man called Henry Jarvis Raymond the year after he co-founded the daily newspaper the New York Times in 1851 and it is when the offices was built in the 1850s and the 1860s and next to the particular building to the right there is a small house that was built in the 1890s and belongs to a police officer to do with the New York City Police Department whose name is Douglas kill-not and next to the particular building to the left there is a small old movie theatre that is mostly only shows movies from the 1890s until the beginning of the 1920s and around the particular building and the small house and the small old movie theatre there are a number of big buildings that was built in the 1920s and the 1930s and that are decorated for Halloween even though it is not until the following day but the particular building and the small house and the small old movie theatre are not and on top of the offices on top of the particular building there is a giant roof that was built in the 1920s and is to do with Art Deco and replacing the last giant roof that was destroyed in a fire that was to do with an unknown reason and on the particular giant roof there are a number of empty tables to do with a yet to be set up small Halloween party even though Halloween is not until the following day and on the edge of the particular giant roof there is a man who is a reporter at the local newspaper whose name is Walter Garrett and who is skinny and a little more than 6 feet tall and is wearing a grey suit because it is the uniform at the local newspaper and his grey suit is brand-new because he only recently got it and it is tailor-made and he has short brown hair and in general you could describe him as a young man who has seen the world but is still down to earth and at the moment he is standing on the edge of the particular giant roof smoking a cigarette and thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I have been on this planet for 36 years and in those 36 years I have seen and done some amazing things and that started when I was 3-month-old in April 1904. In a flashback it is the 30th of April 1904 sometime in the morning and there is an island that is near to England and the island is called S C Island and it can be described as a small island with big buildings and on the island there is a giant school called St. Murder and on the roof of the particular school the 3-month-old Walter is looking over the edge of the roof of the giant school and is looking at the yet to open 1904 S C Island World's Fair (the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair never happened in the particular universe and the same thing with the 1904 St. Louis Summer Olympics) and is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest on this roof behind me there is an especial device that supposedly was invented on the day of the Solar eclipse of August 19, 1887 during the 1887 S C Island's World's Fair from January 1887 to December 1887 and the especial device supposedly makes Solar eclipses go on for 2 days even if they are on the other side of the world in a manner of speaking because I have never seen it actually being used to do with the matter that the last time there was a Solar eclipse was the Solar eclipse of September 21, 1903 and out of interest supposedly the 1887 S C Island's World's Fair was the last time this island did a World's Fair so this particular World's Fair has to do something very especial and out of interest there are still leftover decorations from the 1887 S C Island's World's Fair in the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island (the particular cemetery has been abandoned since 1889 and later in the 1970s it will be open again to do with part of it being turned into a caravan park but in the beginning of the 1980s it will be abandoned again and will still be abandoning in the year 2010) and out of interest down there right now there is a man called Thomas P. Barnett who helped to design a number of buildings next to the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island and some buildings behind the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island (that was destroyed during an incident known as the cliff-falling of 1942 when over 200 foot of the cliffs behind/next to the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island collapse and all the buildings that was on it including a movie theatre and a number of buildings to do with the 1904 S C Island World's Fair and some buildings to do with the 1887 S C Island's World's Fair and the same thing to do with a World's Fair that was in 1922/1923 fell off the cliffs and fell onto the giant beach that goes around the bottom of the cliffs to do with the matter that the particular island is basically a small island on top of a number of cliffs that are thousands of feet tall and the particular buildings that fell off the cliffs in 1942 was destroyed even though later in the 2000s and the 2010s sometimes people use the leftovers of the particular buildings for a number of different things that are hard to describe) and at the moment he is standing in front of a particular building that he designed to do with the particular World's Fair and that is next to the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island and he is getting ready to open the particular World's Fair and to talk to a number of people with a microphone that is attached to a number of speakers going around the island so more or less everyone on the island including myself can hear what he is saying when it comes to the opening of the particular World's Fair (and 1 of the speakers is right next to the 3-month-old Walter and a number of the speakers will still exist in the year 2010). At the same time as the 3-month-old Walter is thinking to himself about his situation on the other side of the island there is a creepy abandoned cemetery that is filled up with a mixture of small tombstones to do with normal people who died during the American Civil War in the 1860s and the vampire wars during a number of different years around the 1860s and the 1870s and giant monuments of important politicians who died around the 1860s and the 1870s but yet still the particular cemetery has still been abandoned since 1889 to do with the matter that the particular cemetery is hunted and anyone who has gone into the particular cemetery after 1889 (apart from particular people) has been killed by ghosts and other things around those lines and next to the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island there is a giant white building and in front of it there are a couple thousand people and in front of the giant white building there is a fat man getting ready to use the microphone that is in front of him to talk to near about every single person on the island using the number of speakers going around the island and the giant white building is called the Museum of the vampire wars and on top of it there is a giant Ferris Wheel that was once known as the Chicago Wheel when it was at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (and both of them was destroyed during the cliff-falling of 1942 and what is left the both of them are still around in the year 2010) and the fat man is the architect of the giant white building Thomas P. Barnett and (like what has already been established) he is getting ready to talk to near about every single person on the island using the number of speakers going around the island to do with the opening of the 1904 S C Island World's Fair and next to him there is a fat middle-aged man wearing an expensive suit and he is called Theodore Roosevelt and he is the 26th President of the United States and at the moment he is talking to Thomas P. Barnett. Out of interest young man I am hoping this is going to be a very good opening and I am hoping this is going to be a very good World's Fair especially because I want to win the United States presidential election that is next November so I can continue doing my job until the next election in 1908 and that will only happen if I am popular and obviously that is the reason why I am here at this particular World's Fair shoring the people how good of a person I am. Everything you are saying is very true and out of interest I am here for a very similar reason to show people how good I am when it comes to building buildings especially when it comes to the building we are in front of especially if I want to build more buildings at other World's Fairs in the future. That is interesting information especially because both of us are using this particular World's Fair for our own futures and nothing else really. That is the right idea. Then the 2 men was interrupted by a middle-aged man wearing an expensive suit walking up to both of them and started a conversation with both of them. Good morning to you gentlemen and as both of you know my name is George E. Kessler and I am a city planner and landscape architect and I help when it came to the design of this particular World's Fair especially when it comes to a bunch of designs to do with the 3 haunted buildings over there (he said pointing to 3 giant buildings that are called the haunted house on the Hill and the ghost mansion and cook manner and each have 20 million rooms and 100,000 floors and all has existed since the year 1400 and are made of different designs and all will be still around in the year 2010 and they are some distance away from the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island but there is a giant train line that goes round the island and the cliffs underneath the islands and some places through the island and has existed since the beginning of 1840 and it is 1 of only 2 ways to get around the island the other 1 is just walking there are no cars or other vehicles on the island and that is to do with a concept that will still exist in the year 2010 and 1 of the stops to do with the giant train line is next to the abandoned cemetery at the end of the island and there is another 1 next to the haunted house on the Hill even though since 1890 it only gets used on especial occasions and in the future it will be destroyed to do with an incident known as the great explosion of 1961 and never rebuilt and it will continue to be that way in the year 2010) and now I must be going to do with other things I must do and because of that I will talk to both of you later. Then the man walked away. Then Thomas P. Barnett went back to talking to Theodore Roosevelt. Out of interest it is hard to believe that the man who was just talking to us is in very big demand and it has been that way for a long time especially in the 1880s when it came to a man called William Rockhill Nelson who was the founder of the newspaper the Kansas City Star in 1880 and the same thing with particular people to do with the 1887 S C Island's World's Fair. That is very true and out of interest about 100 years ago a significant moment in history called the Lewis and Clark Expedition happen and next year there will property be a celebration to celebrate that matter and both of us will probably be involved in that particular celebration as well. That is very true. Yes and out of interest if this particular World's Fair is successful for me it will be the 2nd time a particular World's Fair was successful for me right after the World's Fair that was in Buffalo in New York in 1901 when my predecessor William McKinley was assassinated and I started my job like what happened to 2 of my predecessors James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur in 1881 and what happened to another 2 of my predecessors Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson in 1865. That is very true as well. Yes and out of interest originally there was plans for this this particular World's Fair to take place in St. Louis in Missouri to do with the Saint Louis Exposition an annual concept that started in 1865 after the American Civil War by John 'trigger finger' war and my predecessor Abraham Lincoln before he was assassinated in 1865 and stopped in 1899 to do with the vampire wars (since the year 1010 S C Island has been at war with a vampire island called vampire metropolis and it involves a number of countries around the world including the United States even when it was known as the 13 Colonies even though that has not existed since the 1770s and the particular war will be still going on in the year 2010 especially in that particular year when it will be going on for 1000 years) and was going to come back to do this particular World's Fair when it was going to take place in St. Louis but because it is on this particular island the Saint Louis Exposition is not happening this year and probably will not happen for a number of years. That is very true as well. Yes and out of interest at the moment there is a war between Russia and Japan and there should be a war involving our great country (if you do not count the vampire wars) like the war I was to do with in 1898 the Spanish–American War and the possible future war involving our great country should have the president of this particular island John 'trigger finger' war especially when it comes to his great war record and the matter that he has been doing his job since 1890 and before that he did the same job from 1860 to 1870 and he was in the Spanish–American War in 1898 with me and his good friend the former vampire soldier m-m-m J cup who was a soldier from 1505 unofficially and 1510 officially until he was injured in 1899 in the Battle of Modder River during the 2nd Boer War (and he became a politician in the beginning of the year 1900 and died in 1947 to do with an incident called the 1947 bombing of S C Parliament). That is very true as well. A couple of minutes later Thomas P. Barnett is talking to near about every single person on the island using the microphone and the number of speakers going around the island including the 3-month-old Walter on top of St. Murder some distance away. Good morning to you ladies and gentlemen as you all know this particular World's Fair is to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the particular incident known as the Louisiana Purchase and a number of people including me and President Roosevelt and President War and the landscape architect George Kessler and the architects Paul J. Pelz and Isaac S. Taylor and the spirit of the as of last year dead landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted hope you have a very good time at this particular World's Fair especially when it comes to exploring and meeting a number of people from a number of different countries and the same thing with the Summer Olympics that is going to begin next July (in the particular universe the 1904 Summer Olympics took place on S C Island as well and not in St. Louis in Missouri and mostly took place around/through the 3 haunted buildings) and out of interest ladies and gentlemen this is near the beginning of this century celebrating something that was near the beginning of the last century and it properly will be remembered in the beginning of the next century. Then a giant band nearby led by an old man wearing an old military uniform whose name is John Philip Sousa started and the thousands of people including the 3-month-old Walter started walking away. Back in 1940 and that was a World's Fair worth remembering and out of interest I have been coming up here every day for a number of years and that is because I really like the concept of coming on top of this particular building and looking at my world and thinking to myself about my interesting life and out of interest I was born on New Year's Day 1904 on the English island S C Island on the roof of a giant haunted building called the haunted house on the Hill and slightly over a year later in September 1905 I became a student at the preschool part of the school called St. Murder. In a flashback it is sometime in the beginning of September 1905 and inside of St. Murder there is a long empty corridor that is completely empty in the way of people and the long empty corridor itself is filled up with a mixture of giant cupboards containing novels and books and collections of short stories that was released in the beginning part of 1905 and posters of movies that was released in the beginning part of 1905 and posters of plays that was released in the beginning part of 1905 and at the end of the long empty corridor the year-old Walter is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I do not know the complete details when it comes to the history of this particular school but supposedly this particular school has-been around since the year 1400 and it is a mixture of a preschool and a normal school and a college and a number of my ancestors was students at this particular school as well and a number of those particular ancestors started with the preschool part to do with this particular school as well and right now I could think to myself more about this particular school and my ancestors but I have to get ready for my 1st class. Then the year-old Walter walked away. Sometime later there is a giant classroom and on 1 part of the classroom is filled up with students sitting at desks getting ready for the class to begin and they are shrouded by giant cupboards filled up with a number of novels and books and collections of short stories released a number of years ago and on the other end of the classroom there is a creepy looking man wearing a black suit who is the teacher of the class and he is sitting at his desk getting ready to begin the class and the year-old Walter is sitting at his desk surrounded by a number of other students and he is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I believe this class is about to begin and I would imagine it is going to be interesting especially because it is to do with novels and books and collections of short stories and I could not imagine there would be anything more interesting than that. A couple of minutes later the class is beginning and because of that matter the old schoolteacher is talking to his students. Out of interest boys and girls I would imagine some of you are new when it comes to this particular preschool and because of that matter I might as well introduce myself to you my name is Dr. Holmes and I was born on the 16th of May 1861 and I was executed by hanging on the 7th of May 1896 to do with the matter that when I was alive in the 1880s and the 1890s I was a serial killer especially when it came to me murdering people at the 1893 Chicago world's fair in my murder Castle and after I died which for the record took over 15 minutes for me to die a creature called the slender man took me away. In a flashback in a flashback it is the 7th of May 1896 in the middle of the night in Philadelphia in Pennsylvania there is a giant old prison called Moyamensing Prison and inside of the particular prison there is a small prison cell and inside of the small prison cell there is a small bed and on the small bed the American serial killer Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or as he is better known by Dr H. H. Holmes is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I have a madness inside of me and that madness made me kill people and now I am going to be executed to do with the matter that I killed hundreds of people just because of my madness and because I know I deserve to be executed for the things that have done I am not scared to die even though after I die I am going to be taken away by the creature known as the slender man and go to wherever he believes I deserved to go to and I probably will end up meeting other people he took away like a man called William Kemmler who was executed in 1890 by a at that particular moment in time new way to execute people but I have no time to go into all of that at the moment to do with the matter that in a manner of minutes I am going to be taken away from my prison cell and put on a trap door with a rope around my neck and executed by hanging for the reasons I have already established and because of that matter I might as well established that there is a time to be born and there is a time to die and very soon will be my time to die. Sometime later there is a giant room that is completely empty apart from a giant trapdoor in the middle of the room and in the next room there are a number of people looking through a giant window getting ready to watch the execution and at the moment H. H. Holmes is standing on the giant trapdoor with a rope around his neck and he is looking at the people getting ready to watch his execution especially 1 of them who is a mysterious man all in black who is directly looking at him and he is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest right now I am getting ready to die and the mysterious creature known as the slender man is looking at me right now getting ready to take me away just because he has the power to and out of interest this is the moment of no return and no matter what I say and no matter what I do I am about to die and because of that matter I might as well get ready to die and because of those matters and the matters I have already established I am not scared to die and I have mixed feelings about the mysterious creature known as the slender man taking me away after I am executed. Then suddenly the giant trapdoor open and H. H. Holmes fell through and started to be hung and as that is happening he is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest there was once a time when I ruled the world seriously I lived in a very bad place like Chicago and I was a very rich man especially when it came to my murder Castle. In a flashback in a flashback in a flashback it is the 25th of February 1890 in the early hours of the morning in Chicago there is a giant creepy looking building that is H. H. Holmes's murder Castle and inside of it there is a giant office that is not decorated in any especial way and at the moment H. H. Holmes is sitting at his desk thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest yesterday it was established that Chicago is going to be the location for the world's fair in 1893 to do with celebrating the 400 year anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1492 and because of that matter Chicago is going to be filled up with people and they are going to need a place to stay and that place is going to be the hotel part to do with my murder Castle and to go into more detail in 1893 when the world's fair is happening people are going to come into the hotel part to do with my murder Castle and when they are staying in the rooms to do with the hotel part to do with my murder Castle I am going to murder them and I am going to take their bodies to the basement of my murder Castle and I am going to remove the skin off the bodies and I am going to sell their skeletons to medical schools and that is because my murder Castle will only continue to exist if I have the money to make it exist because think about it the concept of me owning this place has been around since 1886 but I do not know if I will be still owning this place in 1896 because there will probably be another financial crisis sometime in the future because think about it when I was a teenage boy in 1873 there was a financial crisis in North America and Europe that was to do with a mixture of things like Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871 and the giant fire that was in Chicago in 1871 and the giant fire that was in Boston in 1872 and it was still around in the end of the 1870s and is sometimes known as the Long Depression and it could have been the concept behind the financial crisis that was in 1884 during a time that is now known as the Depression of 1882–1885 and out of interest the concept of me murdering people has been around for a very long time and will continue to be around in a very long time seriously I was born to murder and I will continue to murder until the day that I die. Later on the 1st of May 1893 sometime in the morning in Chicago there are a number of giant buildings that al-together to do with Chicago will be known in the future by the name the White city and in the middle of it there is a giant Ferris wheel that is actually the very 1st Ferris wheel ever created by a man called George Washington Gale Ferris, Jr and is called the Ferris wheel and it is sometimes known as the Chicago Wheel and next to it H. H. Holmes is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest sometime later today the world's fair is going to begin and because of that matter this particular object and a number of places in this particular city are going to be filled up with people but I do not care about that matter I only care about the matter that later today the hotel part to do with my murder Castle is going to be filled up with people just getting ready for me to murder them and I just cannot wait until that begins sometime later today and because of that matter I will murder someone this morning just to get ready for the people who I am going to murder later today. Back in 1896 and I did murder someone later that morning and she was some nobody that became part of the many hundreds of people who I murdered and it was like that back in those days and right now I could establish more information about the world's fair that was in 1893 and me murdering people and I could establish information about a particular financial crisis that was in 1893 but there is no point overanalysing the past especially because I am about to die and because I am about to die I might as well establish the last thing I am going to think about and that is during my lifetime I never did anything good I only murdered people I am even rumoured to be an unidentified serial killer from London in 1888 known as Jack the Ripper but I do not care about any of that information I do not care about anything seriously I am about to die and I just care. Then H. H. Holmes was dead to do with being executed by hanging and his ghost appeared outside of the giant prison and at the moment he is completely alone and because of that matter he started thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I personally led to the deaths of hundreds of people and now I am dead myself but I still do not care about the hundreds of people who I murdered. Then he turned round and was face-to-face with the mysterious man all in black and because of that matter he started talking to him. I believe that you are the mysterious creature known as the slender man and you are here to take me away to a location of your own choosing. The mysterious creature known as the slender man did not say anything he just put his hand onto the head of the ghost of H. H. Holmes and both of them disappeared. Back in 1905 and he brought me to this classroom and ever since then I have been the main teacher to do with this classroom and now no more about me because this class is about a particular a French story and to go into more detail in 1785 there was a French writer called Marquis de Sade who was locked up in a French prison called the Bastille and when he was there he wrote a story called the 120 Days of Sodom, or the School of Libertinism on a 39.37 feet long roll of paper made up of individual small pieces of paper smuggled into the prison and glued together and later he was removed from the prison and in 1789 an incident known as the Storming of the Bastille happened to do with a number of prisoners destroying and looting the prison and Marquis de Sade believed his story was destroyed along with the prison and it has even been said he cried tears of blood over it and he died in 1814 believing he would never see his story again but last year some people explored the leftovers of the prison and found the once believed lost story and it was published to do with a man called Dr. Eugen Dühren and out of interest boys and girls Marquis de Sade was a very creepy pervy man who attacked and killed prostitutes in Paris in France in the 1760s. In a flashback in a flashback it is the 10th for February 1763 at 1.00 AM in Paris in France in a location that is near to the apartment of Marquis de Sade Marquis de Sade who is small and fat and wearing a military uniform from the beginning of the 7 Years' War in the end of the 1750s is walking down an alley behind some buildings and at the moment he is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I am a man in his 20s who used to be a soldier in the end of the last decade and at this moment in time I am nothing especial I am just a man with no purpose apart from doing the things that I want to do and thinking about crazy stories that come from my crazy mind. Then some unimportant prostitute walked up to Marquis de Sade and started talking to him. Good evening to you sir do you want to have sex with me for a reasonable price? I would be delighted to. That sounds very good and out of interest the reasonable price for the sex will be because of the Treaty that is going to be in this great country later today. Later there is a small apartment that is mostly a giant bed in the middle of the room surrounded by a number of weapons from the beginning of the 7 Years' War in the end of the 1750s and it is the apartment of Marquis de Sade and at the moment the prostitute is tied down naked to the giant bed of Marquis de Sade and at the moment Marquis de Sade is talking to the prostitute even though there is a gag in her mouth. Today is a very good day for you and out of interest do you know the reason why? Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Because you cannot speak I will answer the question for you. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. And the answer to the question is the reason why today is a very good day for you is because today is the day I will cut you up with a razor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade pulled out a cutthroat razor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade open the cutthroat razor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the stomach of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the breast of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the arms of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the legs of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms and legs of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the vagina of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms and legs and vagina of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the hands of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms and legs and vagina and hands of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the feet of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms and legs and vagina and hands and feet of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the face of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms and legs and vagina and hands and feet and face of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then Marquis de Sade started using the cutthroat razor to cut the throat of the prostitute over and over again and because of that the blood from the cut wounds on the stomach and breast and arms and legs and vagina and hands and feet and throat of the prostitute is running down the giant bed and going onto the floor. Then the prostitute try to say something but was unable to because of the gag in her mouth. Then the prostitute died from the loss of blood from her stomach and from her breast and from her arms and from her legs and from her vagina and from her hands and from her feet and especially from her throat. Then Marquis de Sade drops the cutthroat razor on the floor. Then Marquis de Sade walked out of the room. Later on the 27th of July 1764 at 2.00 AM in Paris in France there is a giant library that is near to the apartment of Marquis de Sade and at the moment Marquis de Sade is walking out of the giant library that was especially opens after hours just for him and at the moment he is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest I was in that particular library to find a copy of a book called the History of Tom Jones, a Foundling that came out in England in 1749 and is mostly about a fictional character who has tons of sex and the particular book was by the since 1754 dead English writer Henry Fielding. Then some unimportant prostitute walked up to Marquis de Sade and started talking to him. Good morning sir do you want to have sex with me for a reasonable price? I would be delighted to. That sounds very good and out of interest the reasonable price for the sex will be because of the matter that yesterday in a place called Pennsylvania there was an incident known as the Enoch Brown school massacre to do with something called the Pontiac's War and that sounds like a good enough reason to me to make a reasonable price on my sex. Back in 1905 and there was many other occasions like that and out of interest boys and girls Marquis de Sade was a very interesting person with a very interesting history. Back in 1940 and I was a student at that particular school to do with a mixture of the preschool part/the normal part from September 1905 until about February 1916 when I went to London in England and became a reporter with a local newspaper. In a flashback it is about February 1916 in England in a small part in London there is a small building that is used for a local newspaper and inside of the small building there is a small office that is mostly completely filled up with filing cabinets and old newspapers that was published by the local newspaper and in 1 part of the office there is a small desk that is surrounded by newspapers that was published by the local newspaper and behind the small desk there is a middle-aged man who is very nerdy looking and wearing a brown suit and at the moment he is talking to Walter who is sitting at the desk opposite him. Out of interest young man I believe you wanted to talk to me. That is correct and I wanted to talk to you because even though I am only 12-years-old I want to become a reporter at this local newspaper. There was once a time recently when I would have to say no to what you are saying but there is a lack of people at this local newspaper to do with the current war in Germany and because of that matter I will say yes to what you are saying. Back in 1940 and right now I could establish more information about my life but I cannot because today there is a new recruits at this particular newspaper and I have to show him the ropes/tell him about the things he will have to know when it comes to this job. Then Walter through what is left of his cigarette off the particular building and walked away. End of chapter 1[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 1903 and beyond At the same time as Walter is standing on the edge of the particular giant roof and smoking a cigarette and thinking to himself about his situation in 1 of the old offices there is a small office that was built when the roof was built in the 1920s and in the small office there is a small desk and on the walls going around the room there are a number of pictures of famous people especially a number of politicians and there are a number of pictures of historical events that have happened since 1903 and at the small desk there is a little old man whose name is Edward Smith but his friends call him smithy and at the moment he is sitting at his desk thinking to himself about his life. Out of interest I was born on New Year's Day 1870 in the Knickerbocker Hospital when it was known as the Manhattan Hospital and had only been open since 1862. In a flashback on New Year's Day 1870 slightly after midnight in New York City there is a small hospital that is called the Manhattan Hospital and inside of the particular hospital there is a giant room that is a walled to do the hospital that is filled up with a number of patients laying in individual hospital beds and in 1 of the hospital beds there is a young woman who has only recently given birth and at the moment she is holding her baby wrapped up in a blanket and her baby is the baby version of Edward Smith and at the moment the young woman is talking to her baby. Out of interest my baby boy this is the world you have been born into a world that is made up of very bad things and very good things and very bad people and very good people and many things around those lines and out of interest in the future your father a popular writer of horror stories from England is going to look after you. Then the mother of the baby version of Edward Smith died. Later on the 10th of May 1876 sometime in the morning in a location outside of Pennsylvania there is a small Stagecoach and inside of the small Stagecoach there is a middle-aged man wearing an expensive suit who is the father of Edward Smith and at the moment he is talking to his son who is sitting on the seat opposite him. Out of interest my son we are going to go to a world's fair that is in Philadelphia that is going to begin later today and I am going there mostly because I helped with the building of it in 1866 and you are going because ever since slightly after you was born about 6 years ago I have been showing you the world so in many years when I am dead and you are a man you will know what to do in the world and to go into more detail I was born on New Year's Eve 1829 slightly before midnight in London in England and my father was a soldier in the American Revolution war in the 1770s and the 1780s and the war of 1812 and a number of other wars including the vampire wars and he was an old man when he fathered me and he died when I was a young boy even younger than you are right now/before he managed to show me the world and because of that matter when I was a young boy/man I learnt many things about the world all by myself and because of that matter I told myself that if in the future I have a son I will show that son the world and because of that matter ever since slightly after you was born about 6 years ago I have been showing you the world. So you are saying when you was young man it took you ages but you manage to make the world your own and you want me to meet the world and then in the future when I am a man you want me to make the world my own and for me to make the world my own I 1st must be shown the world and then I must understand the world and then I must meet the world and then I must make the world my own and then I will be a man. That is where you are correct my son 1st you must be shown the world and then you must understand the world and then you must meet the world and then you must make the world your own and then you will be a man my son. Back in 1940 and my father died the following year and he left me his millions of dollars but I have never cared about the money and because of that matter when I was a young man in the end of the 1870s and in the 1880s and the beginning of the 1890s I mostly did a bunch of jobs to do with building especially when it came to helping a builder called Dracula (in the particular universe the 1897 novel Dracula was never written and the writer Bram Stoker was murdered in the beginning of the 1890s and the fictional character Dracula was a real person and in the 1880s and in the 1890s and in the beginning of the 1900s he was a builder in New York City and he helped with the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty both in the 1880s and the New York World Building from the end of 1889 to the end of 1890 and the Tombs II/City Prison and the amusement Park dreamland both in the beginning of the 1900s and all of the stuff to do with him being a vampire and killing people happen later (and is the concept of another book that I am writing that is based in the same universe) and because the 1897 novel Dracula was never written none of the movie versions not even the famous movies from 1922/1979 and 1931 and 1992 ever existed) who I met at the world's fair in Philadelphia in 1876 and when my father died in 1877 I did not want to move into the giant mansion that belongs to my father so I moved into the small house that belonged to Dracula that is near to this newspaper where I have been living ever since and I have been living there completely alone ever since Dracula mysteriously disappeared sometime in the beginning of 1910. In a flashback it is the 10th of May 1876 slightly before the beginning of the 1876 Philadelphia world's fair there is a giant building called Memorial Hall and in front of it there are a couple thousand people waiting for the beginning of the 1876 Philadelphia world's fair/waiting for the 1876 Philadelphia world's fair to be open by the 18th President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant who at the moment is inside of Memorial Hall talking to the father of Edward Smith as both of them are standing next to the main entrance to the particular building. Out of interest Smith I have been doing my job since 1869 to do with me wining the United States presidential elections in 1868 and 1872 and I will continue doing the job until I am replaced with the 19th President of the United States to do with the United States presidential election next November and stopped doing the job the March after that and because of all of that I might as well put up with certain things like the opening of this particular world's fair. That is all interesting information. At the same time as the 18th President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant and the father of Edward Smith are having a conversation on another level of Memorial Hall Edward Smith is talking to Dracula. Out of interest my name is Edward Smith and my father is downstairs talking to President Grant mostly because they are old friends and it happened because supposedly in the last decade during the American Civil War my father was a war correspondent and he met a number of soldiers including President Grant when he was a soldier in that particular war. That is interesting and out of interest my name is Dracula and I helped with some of the building of this particular world's fair especially because I got a degree in building at New York University in the beginning of this particular decade and I am planning to help out with the building of a particular bridge in Brooklyn in New York City and because I help with the building of this particular world's fair is why I am here and why are you here? Then Edward Smith establish to Dracula the reason why he was there and because of that Dracula went back to talking to him. Out of interest by the sound of it you have a very annoying father and because of that matter if there is anytime you want to get away from him and spend the night in another house my house is in New York City. Then Dracula told Edward Smith the location of his house and because of that matter Edward Smith went back to talking to Dracula. That is a weird coincidence because the giant mansion where I live with my father is near to there. That is a good coincidence and hopefully sometime in the near future you take advantage of that particular coincidence. Later in the middle of 1877 there is a giant cemetery in New York City and the younger version of Edward Smith is standing next to the grave of his father and he is talking to Dracula who is standing next to him. Out of interest supposedly my father was murdered by a vampire that could have been to do with the vampire wars or could have been hired by a rival of my fathers called Phileas Fogg (in a parallel universe the French writer Jules Verne was murdered in the 1830s when he was a schoolboy and because of that he never wrote any of his stories even though that does not matter really to do with the matter that in the particular universe the characters from the stories of the French writer Jules Verne actually existed a long time ago and no longer exist in the year 2010 and in this particular case Phileas Fogg was a crazy inventor who built his machines from the 1850 until he was murdered in the end of the 1910s and the concept of the adventure novel Around the World in 80 Days happened in the beginning of the 1870s (and will come up in another 1 of my books) and all of the movies and TV shows that was based on the works of the French writer Jules Verne never existed as well even though the female reporter Nellie Bly still wrote the book Around the World in 72 Days in 1890 to do with the matter that she went around the world in 72 days for a newspaper story). It is too bad about the death of your father and out of interest what are you planning on doing now? I do not know but what I do know is I do not want to live in the giant mansion that once belonged to my father but now belongs to me. In that case you should get rid of the giant mansion and move in with me in my house that is near to hear. That sounds like a very good idea. Yes it is and out of interest very soon I am going to go to the particular bridge in Brooklyn and helped out with the building and you should come with me. That sounds like a very good idea. That is what I was going for. Later sometime in the end of the 1870s there is a giant only half built bridge that later will be known as the Brooklyn Bridge and on part of the giant only half built bridge Edward Smith is wearing a builders outfit and is sitting on a wooden box talking to Dracula who is wearing a builders outfit as well and is sitting on a wooden box next to him. Out of interest when it comes to this particular bridge how long has the building been going on for? The concept of the building of this bridge has-been going since the end of the last decade to do with a man called John A. Roebling and he died in 1869 to do with an accident that happened the month before to do with the building of this bridge in other words he tried to build this bridge and the bridge ended up killing him a concept that has happened to a lot of people when it comes to the building of this bridge and out of interest in the end of the last decade when I was a young boy I saw the beginning stages of this particular bridge and the accident that happened in 1869 and like you already know in the beginning of this particular decade I went to New York University for a number of years and I got a degree in building and here I am helping with the building of this bridge and out of interest smithy when this particular bridge is completed it is probably going to look very good. Later in the beginning of the 1880s the giant monument the Statue of Liberty is nearly completed and on top of it Edward Smith is talking to Dracula. Out of interest when it comes to this particular monument how long has the building been going on for? The concept of the building of this monument has-been around since the end of the 1860s to do with people like the sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and the man I am the assistant to the designer Richard Morris Hunt but because of a number of delays it was not until recently it was built properly especially when it comes to the matter that the right arm and torch of this monument was on display at the world's fair that was in Philadelphia in 1876 when I met Richard Morris Hunt and you and supposedly the same thing happened with the head of this monument at the world's fair that was in Paris in 1878 but I would not know that because like you already know I have been alive for nearly 20 years and in those nearly 20 years I have never left this country and that is mostly because I have a very bad feeling that if I left this country something very bad is going to happen to me and out of interest smithy you told me about your father and the matter that he wanted you to make the world your own and by doing things like you are right now that is going to happen sometime in the future. Later in the beginning of 1890 there is a giant half built building that in the future will be called the New York World Building and at the moment Edward Smith is talking to Dracula. Out of interest even though I am doing very well with the building of a number of buildings like this particular building with the help of people like you and Richard Morris Hunt in the future I am thinking of becoming a soldier. That sounds like a very good idea and you really should do that when you are finished building some more buildings. Back in 1940 and later in 1897 I went to England during the time of the Diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria by myself and I stayed there to do with the matter that I joined the British army and later in 1899 I went to Africa to do with what some people are referring to as the 2nd Boer War and I stayed there until the end of the war in 1902 and I went back to England and then I moved back to New York City and back in to the house of Dracula and the following year in 1903 I started working for this newspaper and I have been working here ever since and during my nearly 40 years working for this newspaper I have made friends with every single person who is high up in America including all of the presidents of this country from 1903 until now but I have no time to think about any of that at the moment and that is because I have something more important to think about and that something else is later today I am going to go to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park to do with the world's fair that is in New York City and do a story about the matter that tomorrow is going to be the last day of it like what I did with the world's fair that was in San Francisco last year/the beginning of this year that stopped running last month. End of chapter 2[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Walter talk to a new recruit Sometime later inside of the top of the offices on top of the particular building there is a small old office that is a very boring grey colour and was brand-new the day after the New York City draft riots on the 17th of July 1863 and there is a giant old wooden desk that was brand-new the same day as the particular office and the particular desk is in the top right corner of the particular office and next to that on the floor there is a big box that contains information about the 1939/1940 New York World's Fair that has-been going on since April 1939 and will finished on the following day on Halloween 1940 and on top of that particular big box there is a big box that contains information about the 1940 United States Census that was taken last April and on top of that particular big box there is a big box that contains information about Miss America 1940 that happened in the beginning of last month and on top of that particular big box there is a big box that contains information about the 1940 Atlantic hurricane season that has-been going on since last May and on top of that particular big box there is a big box that contains information about the 76th United States Congress that started in the beginning of last year and on top of that particular big box there is a big box that contains information about the Presidency of Franklin D.

Out of interest I have been working here for a long time and that is why the boss told me to show you the ropes/tell you about the things you will have to know when it comes to your new job. What are the stories that this newspaper place do? The stories in the newspaper are usually about murders and scandals and not about war. Why not? The boss of the newspaper is not interested about the war in Germany that is going on at the moment. Why not? Because he was badly injured in the war in Germany from 1914 to 1918 and since then he has been against all wars including the Revolutions in Russia in the 1910s and 1920s and the Russian civil war in the 1910s and 1920s and the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the vampire wars that has been going on since the year 1010. How bad was he injured? He had both his legs shot off by German machine gun fire in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. What side of the war was he on? He fought on the side of the English and he became the boss of this newspaper in 1916 because he saved the life of a really rich man in Battle of Jutland in 1916 and the rich man who owned the newspaper gave him the job. What is today's story? Today's story is about a serial killer I stopped. What are the details? The details are last week I went to the giant mansion of a man named Dr H.p kill. In a flashback it is a week ago on the 23rd of October 1940 and Walter is walking down a long path towards a giant mansion that is very creepy and has-been around since the year 1800 and it was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers in the War of 1812 in the 1810s and the Mexican-American War in the 1840s and the American Civil War in the 1860s and the war in Germany in the 1910s and the giant mansion belongs to a man called Dr H.p kill who Walter believes is a serial killer and at the moment Walter is thinking to himself about him as he is walking down the long path towards his giant mansion. Out of interest that particular giant mansion belongs to a serial killer and he has been living in it on-and-off for over 4 decades and in a manner of minutes I am going to talk to that particular serial killer especially because he murdered 1 of my closest friends and because of that matter I will take him down and make sure he stays down forever never to rise again or as most people would say I will make sure that he is dead upon the floor and will rise never more. Then he knocked on the door of the giant mansion. A couple of minutes later an old man who is about 5 foot tall and looks like he is about 80-years-old and was only a teenager when the 1st recorded indoor ice hockey game happened in the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal in Canada on the 3rd of March 1875 answered the door. Then the old man looked at Walter and started talking to him. You are the reporter Walter Garrett and the master of the mansion is not home especially not to you. Then he closed the door. Later in the day Walter is sitting at his desk in his office and he is talking to his boss on the telephone that is on his desk. I know that man is a serial killer. I agree with you but Dr H.p kill's lawyer has told me to tell you to leave his client alone so leave Dr H.p kill alone or you will be out of a job. You will fire me. I will have no choice. Really you will have no choice. Yes ever you will be fired or you will be transferred to somewhere else. Where will they transferred me to. If you keep bothering Dr H.p kill properly somewhere far away. Do you mean I will go to England and interview the English actor/director Laurence Olivier to do with him directed the play Romeo and Juliet from last May to last June at the 51st Street Theatre in Manhattan and him in the movie Wuthering Heights last year and being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 12th Academy Awards last February but he lost and him doing the movie Rebecca and properly will be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 13th Academy Awards next February but will properly lost again or maybe do you mean I will go to Japan and interview the Emperor of Japan Hirohito to do with him doing his job since 1926 or maybe I will go to Chicago and interview a number of people to do with the Prohibition era about 20 years ago? More like Australia to do with the 1940 Victorian state election last March and the opening of Story Bridge last July. Fine I will make sure I stay away from Dr H.p kill. That is very good to hear because you are a very good reporter and it would be too bad to say goodbye to you from this newspaper. Later Walter is still sitting at his desk in his office and he is talking to his friend Edward Smith on the telephone that is on his desk. Out of interest smithy I know that Dr H.p kill is a serial killer and even though I have already told the details about him I am going to tell you about the details again and because of that matter he started murdering his victims in 1920 when he murdered a female doctor and the last time he murdered someone was last week and that someone was another female doctor and that particular female doctor was friends with me and my fiancé was okay with that. Then Walter and smithy both started laughing. Then smithy continue talking to him. Out of interest can you tell me more about the murder of the female doctor? Yes I can even though I have already told you the details about her murder slightly after it happened a week ago. In a flashback in a flashback it is a week ago on the 16th of October 1940 at 9.00 PM and Walter is sitting at his desk in his office and he is talking to smithy on the telephone that is on his desk about the death of his friend the female doctor. Out of interest smithy I cannot believe a couple of hours ago my friend Lucy was murdered. Out of interest Walter because we are friends I am going to interview you when it comes to your female friend the female doctor. That sounds like a good idea to me. That is the right idea and because of that matter the questions will begin right now and because of that matter when was she born? She was born on the 1st of March 1915 in San Francisco in California and if you was interested in history as I already know you are the 1st of March 1915 was the day before the 1st day of the 1915 San Francisco world's fair a particular world's fair that you went to-to do with a newspaper article. That is interesting and out of interest when did she become a doctor? She became a doctor in the beginning part of 1935 to do with her going to San Francisco State University. When did you 1st met your friend the female doctor? I 1st met her the year before last. Can you go into more detail about that? Yes and as you know in the beginning part of the year before last I was in a hospital in Chicago after I was shot in the chest when I was in Chicago doing a newspaper report about a Chicago gangster. That is correct and the Chicago gangster was executed for trying to kill you. That is correct and in the beginning part of the year before last when I was in the hospital in Chicago my friend Lucy was the doctor who operated on me because around that time she was working in Chicago and when she was murdered a couple of hours ago she was working at a hospital in New York. That is interesting. That is correct and because she saved my life is why I am now hunting down her killer. That is good to hear. Back on the 23rd of October 1940. Odds are you probably will catch him. Yes but I will be out of a job if I get too close to him. Why is that? Because our boss threatened to fire me if I got to close to him and he also said if he does not fire me he would transfer me to somewhere very far away if I got to close to him. That is a problem. Yes it is but lucky enough I will get close to him without my boss knowing because obviously I never listen to my boss especially about things like this. That is a good point and hopefully you will get him and he will go straight to sing sing prison and the electric chair where he will be executed for murdering the 20 women and hopefully some more. What do you mean hopefully some more? Don't get me wrong it would be bad if Dr H.p kill murdered another woman but Dr H.p kill has to be caught in the act so the police can catch him so because of that it would be good if Dr H.p kill murdered another woman just so the police can catch him. That is a good point. Yes and if only Dr H.p kill did murder another woman and he will be caught in the act and then the police will be able to catch him and arrest him and sentence him to death in the electric chair at sing sing prison or maybe he will be shot to death by the police like my greatest case and don't get me wrong helping the police to catch people like Dr H.p kill are good cases but not as good as the best killer I ever helped the police to catch seriously I still have dreams of searching for this man and I still have dreams of how evil this man was and I still have dreams of him because of the matter he was so evil and the matter he was the greatest case I ever helped the police with and because I helped the police to shot him to death and out of interest I miss him which is weird because he was so evil but I feel bad because he died and I feel bad because without him there is no good killers anymore and without him there isn't much choice what to do with the day and it is just because I helped the police to find him and don't get me wrong he was an evil man and he deserves to die but now I never have a good serial killer to find anymore and I just get obvious murderers like Dr H.p kill and that is just because I helped the police to shoot down the greatest of all of the killers I have ever helped the police to catch and out of interest I see him in my dreams and in the dreams he talks to me and says that I am stuck looking for obvious murderers like Dr H.p kill and because I helped the police to kill him I am no better than him and 1 day he will come back and kill me in particular dreams and in other dreams he says to me that he will get everything I love and make me kiss it goodbye and in other dreams he says to me that 1 day he will come back and he will make me suffer the loss of a love 1 like my fiancé and all of those things is all just because I helped the police to shoot him down even though he deserved it because evil people like him deserve to be shot down by the police and to die in the gutter and in other dreams it is me who get shot down by the police and he is the person who helped the police to catch me and it is because of dreams like that why I try my hardest to find people like Dr H.p kill so I can try to fill better about the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police but it never works because I always feel bad about the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police mostly because he was the only killer to be a challenge for me and out of interest some days I feel bad for him to do with the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police and some days I just established that he was a monster and that he deserves to die because he was a monster and on those days I do not feel sorry for him to do with the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police and out of interest on those days I do not see him in my dreams and to go over what I just said on certain days I feel bad about the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police and on certain days I do not feel bad about the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police and on certain days I see him in my dreams and on certain days I do not see him in my dreams and on certain days I do nothing but talk about him and on certain days I do not talk about him at all not even to the people who mean the most to me like my fiancé because on those days are the days I do not feel bad about the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police and I do not talk about him because on those days I don't feel sorry for him because on those days I established he was a monster and he deserves to die because of all of the people that he killed and because he was an evil person and to go into more detail he was a killer and a Nazi surgeon in Nazi Germany and to go into more detail in Nazi Germany he tortured and killed thousands of innocent people and because he was a Nazi surgeon and very evil and he did not care about any of the innocent people who he tortured and killed and on those days I feel sorry because I did not kill him myself but if he came back from the dead again and try to attack me or my fiancé I would kill him established if he is trying to kill me or my fiancé and to go into more detail if he is tried to kill me or my fiancé I will kill him 1st and out of interest the matter that he died and then came back is 1 of the reasons why he is the best killer that I have ever met and 1 of the reasons why I feel bad about the matter that he was the greatest killer who I ever met and I let him die by been shot down by the police. 2 days later on the 25th of October 1940 Walter is at a murder site and to go into more detail at the moment there are a number of police officers to do with the New York City Police Department that are standing around a dead body and the murderer but Walter cannot see who the people are because the police officers are standing in front of them and at the moment Walter is talking to a police officer friend of his who is very fat and is wearing a police uniform because he is a police officer with the New York City Police Department and he is bald. What is the crime Jimmy? The serial killer you are trying to catch Dr H.p kill has just murdered another person. What are the details? He was about to tell his friend the details about the murder but a detective who is called detective murder J Eddie who is skinny and over 6 feet tall and is wearing a black suit and who hates him and the police officer walked over and started talking to them. I told you already no reporters and no annoying police officers in other words get lost you 2. Then Walter looked at detective murder j Eddie and started talking to him. Looked detective Eddie have you ever heard of Freedom of the press? Then detective murder j Eddie looked at Walter and started talking to him. I don't know have you ever heard of get out of here or I will shoot you and your annoying police officers to? Don't worry me and the annoying police officers are leaving of now. That is good and out of interest if I see you again tonight I will shoot you and your annoying police officers to. Okay then. Then Walter and the annoying police officers walked away. Back to normal. And today Dr H.p kill will be executed and in today's paper that was our earlier this morning and to do with this newspaper there was tons of stories to do with Dr H.p kill being arrested and being sentenced to death and I am the 1 who helped to capture him and later this morning both of us are going to go to sing sing prison to do with interviewing a number of people to do with the execution and all of that information will be put into the papers to do this newspaper tomorrow along with a bunch of stuff to do with the matter that tomorrow is Halloween and tomorrow we are going to interview the families of the 21 women who was murdered by Dr H.p kill and the stories to do with those particular 21 women will be put into the papers to do this newspaper the day after tomorrow. That is impressive. Suppose so but it will never be as interesting as the case I did last year. What was the case? Walter was about to answer but then Edward Smith walked into the room and walked up to Walter and started talking to him about the newspaper. Hello Walter. Hello smithy what are you up to today? There are some new stories today. There are new stories all of the time. Not as bad as the new stories. Okay then what are the new stories? He was about to answer but he introduced himself to the new recruit instead. Hello my name is Edward Smith but my friends called me smithy. Hello smithy my name is George. Hello Georgie. Out of interest how long have you been working here? I have been working here for 37 years since 1903 the year after I left a particular war in Africa and out of interest how long have you been working here for? This is my 1st day and out of interest what are the new stories? He looked back at his friend Walter and continue talking to him. Some of the new stories are about the war in Germany that started last year so the newspaper will be about murders and scandals and wars. I thought you said that you said the boss never did war stuff the new recruit said to Walter. I thought so as well. Usually you would be correct but not in this case smithy said to the new recruit. Why what happened? Our boss just got the sack because the rich man who owned this place just died and the new boss who took over gave our boss the sack and the new boss wants to do a load of stories to do with the war in Germany that started last year said smithy to Walter and the new recruit at the same time. Makes sense and we should do stories about the war in Germany that started last year said the new recruit. True and it was stupid about how our old boss never did stories about any wars said Walter. It does make sense because he did lose his legs in the war in Germany from 1914 to 1918 said the new recruit. It is still babyish that he never wrote about any wars just because he lost his legs in 1916 said Walter. Well yes said the new recruit. When do we start getting the information about the war said Walter. The day after tomorrow after the stuff to do with the serial killer Dr H.p kill said smithy. That is interesting and out of interest smithy I will speak to you later because me and Georgie have to go to the prison to do with the execution. Okay then I will see you later. Then Walter and the new recruit stood up and walked away. Then Edward Smith started thinking to himself about Walter. Out of interest I have been working at this newspaper place for about 40 years and in that time I have met many people and Walter is 1 of the good ones. End of chapter 3[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 going to sing sing prison Later there is a giant bridge that is nearly completely empty when it comes to cars and Elevated trains and Streetcars and is called the Brooklyn Bridge and on the bridge there is a car that is a 1937 Ford and it belongs to Walter and inside of the car Walter and the new recruit are going to Sing Sing prison and at the moment Walter is talking to the new recruit. Out of interest in 1930 I worked as a reporter in Norway and I helped out with the Norwegian expedition the Bratvaag Expedition and I was the 1st person to discover the long lost remains of the polar explorer Salomon August Andrée who died to do with the ill-fated S. A. Andrée's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897 and out of interest there was a man called Joseph-Elzéar Bernier and I met him when I was 3-months-old at the 1904 S C Island World's Fair in April 1904 and sometime in the end of 1904 he took me to the Arctic archipelago on his ship the CGS Arctic and the same thing with a number of years from 1904 until 1911 and later I went to his funeral in 1934 and out of interest when I was at the 1904 S C Island World's Fair I met the American writer Jack London and he told me about the Klondike Gold Rush in the 1890s and out of interest are you happy about your new job? Yes and out of interest are you happy about the new change at your newspaper place? Yes it was bound to happen but it will never be as impressive as the case I did last year. What was the case that you are talking about? The case was about 2 women who was both killing and them drained of their blood. People was drained of their blood. Not just drained of their blood. What do you mean? The women who was murdered was drained of their rare blood types. Did you find who did it? Yes I did it was done by a man who was recently executed for allowing a 10-year-old child to die of starvation and bought back to life and the rare blood types kept him alive which didn't save him from dying by being shot by the police. What was his name? His name was Dr Xavier but he was usually referred to as Doctor X. He sounded like a monster and it is good he is dead. Yes it is. How far away are we from the prison? About 20 minutes. Are you going to visit the prisoner before he gets executed? Yes I am going to interview him about his crimes and interview a few people at the prison to do with the execution. Is this the 1st time you have gone to sing sing? No I have been going to Sing Sing prison for years and it is where I met my fiancé. You have a fiancé. Yes I do and I am meeting her for lunch today. How good for you. You are correct because I love my fiancé. That is very interesting and 1 day I would probably get married myself if I find the right girl. That is the right idea. 20 minutes later they got to Sing Sing prison and to go into more detail Walter and the new recruit park the car in a place for parking outside of Sing Sing prison and to go into more detail Sing Sing prison is very big and very white and surrounded by giant metal gates and there are some Guard towers with some prison guards smoking cigarettes and holding weapon looking at some prisoners that are in the prison grounds and there are a number of prison guards standing outside of Sing Sing prison smoking cigarettes. Then Walter and the new recruit both got out of the car. Outside of the car Walter and the new recruit walked from the car to outside of Sing Sing prison. Outside of Sing Sing prison Walter and the new recruit walked into Sing Sing prison. Inside of Sing Sing prison Walter and the new recruit are in the front part of Sing Sing prison that is completely empty and at the moment Walter is talking to the new recruit. Out of interest at the moment we have to wait for a prison guard to let us in. Okay. Then Walter and the new recruit walked a little forward. Then a prison guard who is black and over 6 feet tall and very massively stopped Walter and the new recruit and started talking to Walter. You can walk in Mr Garrett but your new recruit cannot. Then Walter looked at the new recruit and started talking to him. You go wait in the car. Then Walter gave the new recruit the keys to his car. Then the new recruit went back to the car and Walter walked deeper into Sing Sing prison without him. Deeper into Sing Sing prison Walter and the prison guard are walking down a corridor that is completely white and completely empty apart from the matter that there are a number of people in prison cells yelling random stuff out but Walter and the prison guard do not care because they are both used to it. During the walk down the corridor Walter is talking to the prison guard. How are you doing Jim? I am doing fine Walter. Thank you for getting rid of the annoying newcomer. It is what I usually do. And I am grateful of that. Out of interest are you here to visit your fiancé? Yes and no. What does that mean yes and no? That means I am here to visit the serial killer I help to capture Dr H.p kill and my fiancé. Is that a sex thing he said laughing. If I play my cards right he said laughing. Then they both stopped and Walter put a cigarette into the prison guard's mouth and lit it with a match. Then the prison guard put a cigarette into Walter's mouth and lit it with a match. Then they continued to have a conversation as they are standing there. Out of interest Walter how many serial killers have you helped the police to catch in your career here in New York? I have personally helped the police to catch 50 serial killers. How many of them was sent to the electric chair? All 50 of them was sent to the electric chair. When was the 1st time that you helped the police to catch a serial killer? It was 1935. Can you go into more detail about that? Yes I can. In a flashback it is 1935 in New York City in an Italian restaurant that is near to the newspaper place Walter and an old man called dead l dead who is a little old man wearing an old black suit are sitting at a table in a private back room that is completely blank and covered with pictures to do with the Italian restaurant and nothing else and at the moment both of the particular people are eating pasta and drinking Italian wine and at the moment Walter is talking to the old man called dead l dead. You are a killer. I am not a killer I am a politician. You are not a politician you are a killer. I am a politician and not a killer. Fine I will interview you. Okay then interview me about the matter that I am a politician and not a killer. What is your name? My name is Dead l dead. When was you born? I was born on the 6th of November 1860 in Washington, DC on the day and at the time of the 1860 United States presidential election. How long have you been a politician for? I have been a politician since 1875 when I was evolve with the 44th United States Congress and did politics to do with things like the 1875 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election and Custer's Last Stand at the Battle of Little Bighorn the following year in 1876 and the same thing with the 1876 Philadelphia World's Fair. You have been a politician for 60 years since 1875 and you have been a serial killer for 40 years since 1895 when you murdered a man called Ed Silch and he was pitcher for the 1888 Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the National League and he was 29-years-old and it is believed his death was to do consumption. Fine I am a serial killer but I never talk about the murder of Ed Silch from 40 years ago. You know all the crimes you did will make you go to the electric chair at Sing Sing prison. Yes I do because I have been killing for 40 years so it is my time to die for all the people I murdered even though I have never cared about any of the people who I have murdered in my 40 year reign of murdering but when the police questioned me about any of the murders that they think I committed I will confess even to murders I did not commit. That is correct and that is what is going to happen very soon. Back in 1940 and that man went to the electric chair and was happy about it because he realised he had been killing for long enough and it was about time that he stop killing and just died in the electric chair at Sing Sing prison. That is a good story and it was good that the old man got what was coming to him because if you live a life of crime you deserve to get punished for it especially if you live a life of crime that goes on for 40 years in this case from 1895 to 1935. That is completely correct and that is why I am here today to visit a criminal who got punished for his crimes which I helped him get arrested for because he thought he would never get captured by the police for what he did and now he is getting punished for his crimes. Then they both continued walking down the corridor. Then they got to the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill. Then they stopped walking outside of the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill. Then they dropped their cigarettes onto the floor and stepped on them. Then they both walked in to the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill. Inside of the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill the serial killer Dr H.p kill who is a little old man wearing a prison uniform is handcuffed to a table and there is nothing else in the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill because there does not need to be nothing else in the cell. Then Walter walked up to the serial killer Dr H.p kill and started talking to him. Hello Dr Kill. I keep telling you I am not the man who did the crimes. Of course you would say that to make sure you don't go straight to the electric chair where you are going tonight so you might as well confess to the 21 murders that you did and get ready to die in the electric chair which like I said will happen tonight. I am telling you I didn't do any of the 21 murders that you and the world believes I committed. This might be a surprise to you Dr Kill but you was caught at a murder site and to go into more detail you was found by the dead body of a female lawyer who out of interest was a friend of mine. I am telling you I have never seen that woman before so I did not kill her. Just face the facts you are a killer and tonight you will be executed for your crimes. Then Walter and the prison guard walked out of the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill. Outside of the cell of the serial killer Dr H.p kill Walter and the prison guard walked down the corridor and stopped at a room. Then Walter put a cigarette into the prison guard's mouth and lit it with a match. Then the prison guard put a cigarette into Walter's mouth and lit it with a match. Then Walter looked at the prison guard and started talking to him. See you later Jimmy. Okay Walter see you later he said laughing as he walked away. Then Walter stood there smoking the cigarette for a minute and then he threw it on the floor and stamped on it and walked into the room. Inside of the room Walter walked up to a female prison guard and to go into more detail the room is just some room for female prison guards on their break and because of that matter the room is very small and is nearly completely empty apart from a small table and a couple of boxes of food and the female prison guard is facing her back towards Walter. Then the female prison guard turned around and then was face-to-face with Walter. Then she walked up to him and kissed him. Then she stopped kissing him. Then she looked him in the eyes and started talking to him. Hello babe. Hello Honey. Are you here to see me? Yes I am here to see you and the serial killer who I help to capture. You are so cute. Yes I am. So did you talk to him? Did I talk to who? Did you talk to the serial killer you helped to put away. Yes I did I talked to him a moment ago and he is still denying that he is the killer that everybody in the world knows he is. Well obviously he trying to make sure he doesn't get sent to the electric chair tonight. It won't work because he is guilty and everybody in the world knows he is guilty and tonight he will fry for his crimes. Out of interest I am working in that part of the prison. When did that start? I have been working there since last year. What is the job? I am supposed to guard the people who are going to be executed and to go into more detail I guard them when they are talking to their family's and I guard them when they are talking to their friends and I guard them when they are talking to their loved ones and I guard them when they are about to be executed. It sounds like a tough job. Yes it is but I can look straight into the eyes of the content right before they die and to go into more detail I guard them and I walk them down the corridor to the electric chair and I am 1 of the people who looks into them eyes right before they are executed. How good for you he said unsure how to react to something so weird. I love this job. Okay I will see you later after I interviewed a number of people to do with the execution. Can I come with you? Yes you can. Then Walter and his fiancée walked out of the room. Outside of the room Walter and his fiancée started walking down the corridor. End of chapter 4[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 outside of sing sing prison At the same time as Walter is in sing sing prison the new recruit is waiting in Walter's car and is having a conversation with his brother-in-law over a 2-way radio who at the moment is talking to the new recruit. Hello George said a voice over the 2-way radio. Hello John how are you? I am fine. What are you doing? I cannot talk about it but what are you up to? At the moment I waited in the car of my new partner. You got your new job at the newspaper place did you? Yes I did. Why are you waiting in the car? Because the prison guard at the front of sing sing prison said I wasn't allowed in. Why didn't you mention you father or your great-grandfather or your great-grandfather brother? Because I am trying to do it all by myself and without my family or my great-grandfather or my great-grandfather brother especially without my father. Why your father is a great man and a war hero? My father is a war hero but mostly he is a massive big jerk and everybody thinks that. I have met you father. Well obviously when you met him to ask him if you could marry his daughter/my sister in 1934 and he agreed to it. Yes he did after a while he said laughing. That is true because he is a jerk. He continued to laugh. Lucky enough he is not my partner's father. Why is that? Because he has a fiancé. Really what are the details? I don't know the details but I will tell you later if I find them out. Okay. Out of interest how is my father? He is fine especially to do with his new promotion from being a Colonel in the army to becoming a Brigadier General in the army what just means the army hasn't realised that he is a massive big jerk. Actually they know he is a massive big jerk but they know he is a massive big jerk that wins battles. He wins battles does he? Yes he does and out of interest the reason why your father is a massive big jerk is probably because his father/your grandfather was a massive big jerk. Apparently he was because obviously neither of us ever met him because when he died I was only a baby and it was before you met my father. True by the way I must go now and I will speak to you later goodbye. Goodbye to you to. Then the new recruit turned off the 2-way radio. Then the new recruit got out of the car to do with having a cigarette. Outside of the car the new recruit bumped into someone and to go into more detail the new recruit wasn't looking where he was going when he got out of the car and the person who he bumped into is a little old man with white hair and a white beard and he is wearing a grey suit. Then the new recruit looked at the person and started talking to him. Sorry about that sir. That is okay young man. My name is George. Hello George my name is Dr Kills and are you here to meet someone? Yes I am a new reporter for the local newspaper and I am here with my new partner who is inside and I am waiting in the car. I understand 1 of the guards won't let you in. No they won't. Out of interest I am here to visit a friend. What is your friend called? My friend is called Dr Killing. What does your friend do? My friend works in the prison in the part to do with executing the prisoners and to go into more detail he is 1 of the 5 assistants to the executioner Joseph Francel. My partner is properly interviewing him. Why would your partner interviewed him? My partner is in their interviewing people for the execution of the serial killer and to go into more detail for the newspaper report he is interviewing the serial killer and the warden and the executioner and the guards who are guarding him and after he is executed he interviews the families of the victims and I know all of that because he told me before we got here. Out of interest what is your partner's name? Walter. Walter Garrett. Yes why do you know him? You could say that me and him are old friends but he probably doesn't remember me he said walking away. I thought you said you are here to visit your friend. I just remembered today is his day off and he won't be there. Okay goodbye. Yes and goodbye to you to young man and have a good day. You have a good day to. Then the person walked away. Then the new recruit started thinking to himself about the person he was talking to. Nice man but he seems very forgetful and it was nice to talk to my brother in law again and I wonder what my new partner is doing inside of Sing Sing prison and I wonder how long he is going to be. End of chapter 5[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 New York City in 1940 At the same time as Walter is in sing sing prison and at the same time as the new recruit is waiting in Walter's car there is a giant public park called Flushing Meadows–Corona Park and in it there is the giant 1939/1940 New York World's Fair and in that there is 2 objects called Trylon and Perisphere together known as the Theme Center and in front of it Edward Smith is thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest this has been a good world's fair and because of that matter it will be sad to say goodbye to it. Then a young police officer walked up to Edward Smith and started talking to him. Hello smithy. Hello Douglas (Douglas kill-not the young police officer with the New York City Police Department who lives next to the newspaper place as established earlier in the book) are you and the other members of the New York City Police Department protecting this place? Yes especially because this world's fair is going to stop tomorrow and out of interest when this world's fair stops tomorrow the boys to do with the New York City Police Department will probably move onto something different like what has been happening ever since I started doing this job in the beginning of 9 years ago. That is the right idea and it has been like that with my job as well that as you already know has-been going on for nearly 40 years. Then an old fat man walked up to Edward Smith and started talking to him. Hello smithy this is a very good world's fair. That is the right idea even though it is going to be said to say goodbye to it tomorrow. That is the right idea but all good things must come to an end. That is correct and by the way the young man standing next to me is called Douglas kill-not and he is a police officer with the New York City Police Department and you should talk to him as I am in a different place to do with this world's fair. Then Edward Smith looked at Douglas kill-not and started talking to him. And you should talk to Mayor Guardia as I am in a different place to do with this world's fair. Then Edward Smith walked away Then Douglas kill-not looked at the man and started talking to him. You are Fiorello H. La Guardia the 99th Mayor of New York City a job you have been doing since the beginning of 1934 but obviously you know all of that already and by the way my name is Douglas kill-not and I am a police officer with the New York City Police Department and I have been since the beginning of 1930 and I am hoping that I will become a detective in the future. That is the right idea when it comes to having an important job that has been around for a very long time and will be around for a very long time and out of interest young man this world's fair has been a very good thing to be involved with but tomorrow everyone must say goodbye to it especially because it is going to be taken apart and use for materials to do with the current war in Germany and out of interest young man I am a great love of architecture but even I have to say goodbye to all of this stuff seriously in the end of April last year I said hello to a number of objects that showed images of the future especially when it came to a concept called Futurama and showing New York City in the years 1959 and 1960 but tomorrow I must say goodbye to all of it forever never to say hello to it again and now I must be going. Then the man walked away. Then Douglas kill-not started thinking to himself about his situation. He was a friendly man and everything he said was completely correct and out of interest the 2 objects in front of me will be removed very soon but I wonder in the future will there be another world's fair in this park that will actually have objects that will last longer than a year. After Edward Smith walked away he started thinking to himself about the world's fair. Out of interest there are many things I can think about when it comes to this world's fair but because this place is going to stop existing tomorrow there is no point over thinking it and out of interest very soon I am going to leave this place and go back to my newspaper and write my story and it will be put in tomorrow's paper with all the stuff to do with the serial killer who is getting executed later today. End of chapter 6[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 the warden of sing sing prison Back in sing sing prison Walter and his fiancée are both walking down the corridor and are having a conversation (and at the moment she is talking to him) at the same time as they are walking. Out of interest are you here alone? No I am not I am here with a new recruit to the newspaper who name is George but I don't know his last name because I have only just met him. Where is he at the moment? He is outside in the car. Why is he outside in the car? He is outside because me and 1 of the prison guards are friends and I got my friend the prison guard who is called Jimmy to make sure he doesn't come in and bothered me and you when we talk especially when I talk to you about how much I love you and about how me and you will soon be married because we love each other and we will talk about how much we love each other. You are so romantic. Then they both stopped walking and she kissed him. Then she stopped kissing him. You are so romantic and I love you and stuff she said at the same time as she was picking her nose. Thank you I love you to. Then she pulled her finger out of her nose and kissed him again. Then she stopped kissing him again. You are so romantic. Then she kissed him again. Then she stopped kissing him again. Out of interest I am very happy about the matter that we will soon be married. You are so romantic. Then she kissed him again. Then she stopped kissing him again. Then they continue walking down the corridor and they both stopped outside of the execution room. Then Walter's fiancée looked at Walter and continue talking to him. This is the room where I work in and it is the room where the prisoner who are about to be executed stayed for his/her last night before they are taken to the room with the electric chair which is called the execution room and at the moment the criminal is in his cell but obviously you would know that because you have already spoken to him and at the moment the people you want to interview are in different places. What do you mean different places? Well the warden is in his office and the executioner it in the execution room getting it ready and the other people to do with the execution who work with the executioner are also in the execution room and out of interest which 1 would you like to interview 1st? I would like to interview the warden 1st. Okay let's go to his office and interview him. Okay. Then they both walked down the hallway. Walter and his fiancée both stopped at the warden office. Then they both walked in. In the office of the warden of Sing Sing prison the warden of Sing Sing prison is sitting at his desk doing paperwork and to go into more detail the office of the warden of Sing Sing prison is very big and is filled up with over 20 years worth of stuff and most of it is unrecognisable and there are a bunch of cupboards and filing cabinets and the warden of Sing Sing prison is very fat and is wearing a black suit that is very ugly and he has short black hair and his desk is giant and old and is brown and is covered with paperwork to do with criminals at Sing Sing prison currently and paperwork to do with criminals at Sing Sing prison in the last 20 years and the paperwork he is doing at the moment is to do with the poet Lord Byron and he does not know that Walter and his fiancée are watching him. Out of interest Lord Byron was a poet from the early part of the 1800s and he was a very creepy man and that is because he lived in a completely dark castle and he kept a wolf as a pet and he drunk out of human skulls and just in general people was creeping out by him and out of interest apart from the matter that he was very creepy you would imagine that he had tons of friends including a woman called Mary Shelley especially because he had a child with her half-sister Claire Clairmont and he was invited to a number of parties and social events and many other things that rich people go to and in general was considered the life and soul of the party and out of interest it was too bad that I never met him especially because he died in 1824 when he was 36-years-old. Then the warden of Sing Sing prison look at a picture of the poet Lord Byron that is next to a number of other pictures on his desk that includes a picture of his recently dead wife and started talking to it. Out of interest you had a very interesting life and that is because you lived in a great moment in time and it is because of that matter why whenever I think about your life I established to myself that I was born too late especially because you was alive and died in the beginning part of the 1800s and I was born near the end part of the 1800s. Then the warden of Sing Sing prison continue doing his paperwork. Out of interest later this week I should go to Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall in Nottinghamshire in England to visit the grave of the poet Lord Byron like I have done on many of occasions and right now I have finished establishing information about the poet Lord Byron and I will now begin establishing information about Pope Alexander VI and his reign from the 11th of August 1492 to the 18th of August 1503 and his life in general and when I have finished doing that I might establish information about other popes such as the homosexual 1 Pope Julius III and his reign from the 7th of February 1550 to the 23rd of March 1555 and his life in general and the longest reigning 1 Pope Pius IX and his reign from the 16th of June 1846 to the 7th of February 1878 and his life in general and the shortest reigning 1 Pope Urban VII and his reign for 13 calendar days and he died in 1590 before his coronation and his life in general and the 1 at the moment Pope Pius XII and his reign that has been going since the 2nd of March last year. Then Walter and his fiancée walked over and sat down in 2 chairs in front of the desk of the warden of Sing Sing prison. Then the warden of Sing Sing prison looked up from his paperwork and said hello miss disease. Hello warden Lawes. Please call me Lewis. Okay Lewis this is the reporter who is here to interview you to do with executed the serial killer. Okay. When do you want the interview to take place said Walter. Right now is fine but I cannot do it for long because obviously I have important business to do because this prison will practically fall down without me. Okay Warden Lawes these are the questions what is your name? My name is Lewis Edward Lawes but I signed it as Lewis E. Lawes on my official paperwork to do with the matter that I am the Warden of Sing Sing prison. When was you born? I was born on the 13th of September 1883 in Elmira in New York. What is your job? My job is I am the warden of Sing Sing prison like I just said when you asked me my name and I said my name and the matter that I am the warden of Sing Sing prison.

Yes I do and I was 1st offered the job at the end of 1919 and I started the job on New Year's Day 1920 and to go into more detail about when I was 1st offered the job at the end of 1919. In a flashback it is late 1919 there is a giant room that is completely white and is filled up with white furniture including some white filing cabinets and some other items that are hard to describe that includes a giant white desk and behind the particular desk there is a skinny man wearing a white suit that makes him look like he is going to a wedding and he is the 42nd Governor of New York Al Smith and he is talking to Lewis Edward Lawes who is sitting in a white chair opposite him. Hello Mr Lawes I want to give you a job. I already have a job. But this job is better. Is it really? Yes and out of interest what is your job? I am the warden of Massachusetts State Prison. How long have you been doing that job for? I have been the warden of Massachusetts State Prison since last year. But this job is better. What is the job? The job is you will become the warden of Sing Sing prison. Sing Sing prison. Are you interested in the job? Yes I am. Okay but what about the matter that you are the warden of Massachusetts State Prison? I no longer care about the Massachusetts State Prison because I was born in New York not Massachusetts so I will take the job. That is good and I will do the paperwork so you can start soon. Thank you. But it might take a couple of months for it to happen. Okay then I will do the job of my dreams very soon. Yes you will. Back in 1940 and that is how I got the job here 21 years ago in 1919. Do you remember when you 1st started here in 1920? Yes I do. In a flashback it is the 1st of January 1920 and Lewis Edward Lawes is walking down the corridor of Sing Sing prison carrying a giant cardboard box and at the moment he is thinking to himself about his new job as the warden of Sing Sing prison. Out of interest today is going to be a good day for me especially because today I have a job that is much better than all the rest of my jobs. Then Lewis Edward Lawes walked into his office carrying the giant cardboard box. Inside of his new office Lewis Edward Lawes walk through his new office which at the moment is nearly completely empty apart from a desk and some filing cabinets on the other side of the room and some chairs next to the desk and Lewis Edward Lawes is carrying the giant cardboard box still. Then Lewis Edward Lawes sat down at his new desk which is the same desk that he is sitting at in 1940 which at the moment is completely empty and Lewis Edward Lawes is carrying the giant cardboard box still. Then Lewis Edward Lawes started thinking to himself about his situation. Today is the 1st day of the rest of my life and me and my wife will go far in life because of this job and it will be much betters than my old jobs because those ones was good jobs but this 1 will be better. Then Lewis Edward Lawes opened the cardboard box. Then Lewis Edward Lawes removes the object from the cardboard box and he is establishing to himself what the objects are as he is removing them and putting them onto his new desk. In my cardboard box there are 45 objects and those 45 objects are Number 1 a picture of the Proteus-class colliers USS Cyclops that mysteriously disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle the year before last and Number 2 a signed picture of the inspector who investigated the murders of Jack the Ripper in 1888 Frederick Abberline and Number 3 a baseball from the 1919 World Series of baseball last year and Number 4 a piece of paper that contains information about the 1856 mysterious disappearance of a man called Matias Perez and Number 5 a piece of paper that contains information about the 1872 mysterious disappearance of the crew of the British merchant brigantine Mary Celeste and Number 6 a piece of paper that contains information about the 1890 mysterious disappearance of the movie director Louis Le Prince and Number 7 a piece of paper that contains information about the American serial killer H.

Then Lewis Edward Lawes started doing paperwork to do with his job as the warden of Sing Sing prison. Out of interest the job of the warden of Sing Sing prison has been going for nearly 100 years since 1825 when Elam Lynds became the 1st warden of Sing Sing prison and out of interest I am very happy about this new job and because of that matter I am hoping very much that I do this job for a very long time and out of interest my predecessor Daniel J. Grant was only the acting warden of Sing Sing prison for about a year from nearly end part of last year to today and out of interest none of my predecessors did the job for very long apart from my predecessor Augustus A. Brush who was the warden of Sing Sing prison from 1880 to 1891. Later in the day warden Lawes is walking around the prison and is talking to some female secretary who is unimportant. Out of interest young lady can you tell me about my schedule? Okay Warden Lawes the schedule for today is in 10 minutes it will be 9.00 AM which is when we wake up the prisoners and also today you have a board meeting and a bunch of other stuff. It is tough to be the warden. Yes it is but it is really rewarding and to go into more detail when you are doing your job you are going to get lots of money and people who fear you and people who respect you and you will be famous and you will be invited to a bunch of rich people houses for dinner and you will be invited to a bunch of parties run by a bunch of rich people and you will be interviewed in a bunch of magazines and newspapers to do with a bunch of stuff that you have done and because you are the boss if you say something a load of people will do it because they will have to because you are the boss. It all sounds good. Yes it does. Back in 1940 and that was my 1st day as the warden of Sing Sing prison in 1920 and out of interest those 45 objects that I mentioned are still around my office and there are even more objects that are from the past around my office. That is interesting and out of interest what was your jobs before you was the warden of Sing Sing prison? I have had a number of jobs before I was the warden of Sing Sing prison. Can you go into more detail about them? Yes I can and out of interest when I was a boy my father was a prison guard at the New York State Reformatory and he took me to work with him a number of times of a number of years but I do not care about that because I never liked my father and because of that I ran away from home at the age of 17 and joined the United States Coast Artillery and later I worked at an insurance company before beginning my prison career as a Prison guard at Clinton Prison in Dannemora in New York on the 1st of March 1905. In a flashback it is the 1st of March 1905 in a corridor in Clinton Prison in Dannemora in New York that is completely white and completely empty Lewis Edward Lawes is talking to a prison guard friend of his who is unimportant. Out of interest I cannot wait to start this job because this will probably be a very good job. You are correct because this job properly has good money and we can beat people to death especially if they attack us 1st or if we feel like it and we just make it look like they try to attack us. That is completely correct and hopefully that will happen because the prisoners in this prison all deserved to die because prisoners deserve to die because they broke the law and they got caught and because of that they deserve to die because if you are stupid enough to be captured breaking the law you deserve to die. That is completely correct and because of that we will begin murdering people later today. That sounds very good. That is the right idea. Back in 1940 and on the 30th of September 1905 I married my wife Katherine. Can you go into more detail about that? What do you want me to go in more detail about? You and Your wife. Okay then and out of interest I met her in 1905. In a flashback it is somewhere after the 1st of March 1905 sometime in the early hours of the morning and Lewis Edward Lawes is in a completely dark room guarding some prisoner that cannot be seen in the shadows and Lewis Edward Lawes is standard some distance away from the prisoner and it is because that why Lewis Edward Lawes cannot see him. Then Lewis Edward Lawes looked out of a window that was not there a moment ago. Then Lewis Edward Lawes saw a woman walking in the grounds. Then Lewis Edward Lawes ran out of the room. Outside of the room Lewis Edward Lawes ran down the corridor and out of the building. Outside of the building Lewis Edward Lawes ran across the grounds. Then in the middle of the grounds Lewis Edward Lawes stops running and started looking around the grounds for the woman but he cannot see the woman at all. Then Lewis Edward Lawes woke up in his bed in the place where the prison guards sleep in the prison. The next day in a corridor in Clinton Prison in Dannemora in New York that is completely white and completely empty Lewis Edward Lawes is talking to the prison guard friend of his. I saw her in 1 of my dreams again. How many nights has it been now? I have seen her in my dreams every night for 2 weeks in the same way. Remind me again what is the way? I am in a room guarding some prisoner with no identity that I cannot see and who I do not talk to and then I look out of the window and see her the girl of my dreams in the grounds of this prison and then I run out of the room and down the corridor of the prison and then I run out of the prison and I run to the middle of the grounds of this prison and when I get to in the middle of the grounds of this prison I do not see her again and every night it has been like that I see the girl of my dreams and when I go down there she is no longer there and it just makes me think that I will never have the girl of my dreams. Don't talk stupid of course you will find the girl of your dreams. Do you really think so? I know so. How many more dreams do you think I must go through 1st before I find the girl of my dreams? I do not know but probably a load but hopefully you will find her. The next day Lewis Edward Lawes is walking down a corridor in the prison. Then Lewis Edward Lawes stop walking and looked out of the window and saw the girl from his dreams. Then Lewis Edward Lawes ran down the corridor and out of the building. Outside of the building Lewis Edward Lawes ran across the grounds. Then in the middle of the grounds Lewis Edward Lawes walked up to her and said hello my name is Lewis Edward Lawes. Then the girl from his dreams looked at him and started talking to him. Hello Lewis my name is Katherine Stanley. Hello Katherine. Then he kissed her. Back in 1940 and we was married from 1905 to when she died in 1937. Then Lewis Edward Lawes looked at her picture on his desk. Then Warden Lawes continued talking at the same time and he was looking at the picture of his deceased wife. Me and my wife was married for over 30 years and I loved her. Then Warden Lawes pauses for a minute and thought about her for a minute. Then Warden Lawes put the picture of his deceased wife down and continues talking to Walter and his fiancée. I will now go back to talking about my career and like I was saying I was a guard at Clinton Prison in Dannemora in New York and that started the 1st of March 1905 and I married the girl of my dreams the 30th of September 1905 and later I worked at the 1st Auburn Prison and then I worked at Elmira Reformatory and later in March 1915 I was named Superintendent of the City Reformatory on Hart Island in New York City and later I became warden of the Massachusetts State Prison in 1918. In a flashback it is 1918 and Warden Lawes is sitting at his desk looking around his new office and to go into more detail the office is very small and very grey and just has a small desk and a chair behind the desk and piles of paperwork everywhere and nothing else. Then Warden Lawes started thinking to himself about his office. By the look of it this job will be much betters than my old jobs. Then he started to do his paperwork. Out of interest I do not like the look of this office but like I establish a moment ago this job will be much betters than my old jobs. Back in 1940 and it was better than any of my other jobs apart from being the warden of Sing Sing prison and like I have already established in late 1919 I was offered the job as the warden of Sing Sing prison by the Governor of New York Al Smith and in 1920 I became the warden of Sing Sing prison and I have been the warden of Sing Sing prison since 1920. Can you think of any of the prisoners that was here during your 20 years as warden of Sing Sing Prison? Yes I can think of some. Out of interest what do you remember of the years that you was warden of Sing Sing Prison? I remember every single day for the past 20 years and I remember all the prisoners which was locked up in this prison and out of interest I used to have dinner in the canteen when it was empty at night time and out of interest I have lunch there with 2 guards guarding me and I have certain prisoners taken out of the cells and when they was taking out of their cell and brought to the empty canteen I would have a conversation with them at the same time as I was eating my dinner and the prisoners eat nothing because I only put them out of their cell and had them brought to the empty canteen because I wanted to say something to the prisoner and to go into more detail when I say I wanted to say something to the prisoner I actually mean I told them what to do and they did it or I would have made their sentences longer and then I have the guard throw the prisoner back into their cell and then continue eating my dinner. Makes sense you was the warden. Yes it does. In a flashback it is 1921 at 12.30 AM and Warden Lawes is sitting at a table that prisoners usually eat there dinner at and he is eating dinner in the empty canteen what is completely empty apart from him and 2 guards who are guarding him when he is eating. Then a guard pushed a prisoner on the floor of the empty canteen and to go into more detail the prisoner is a middle-aged man with long hair and a long beard wearing a prisoner uniform and mostly he looks like a tramp. Then Warden Lawes looked at him and said what is your name prisoner? Then the prisoner looked at Warden Lawes and started talking to him. My name is Paul Geidel sir. How long have you been in Sing Sing prison prisoner? I have been in Sing Sing prison since 1911 sir. What was your crime prisoner? Murder Sir. What was the details of the murder prisoner? The details was I committed a crime in 1911 at the Iroquois Hotel on West 44th Street in New York City when I was working as a bellhop sir. In a flashback in a flashback it is late July 1911 and Paul Geidel is working as a bellhop and because of that he is holding a load suitcases and is walking into the room of a man named William H. Jackson who is a 73-year-old wealthy broker. Inside of the hotel room Paul Geidel put the suitcases down. Then Paul Geidel looked round at the fancy room that is filled up with very expensive furniture that Paul Geidel could never afford in 1 million years or 1 million lifetimes. Then Paul Geidel saw some money on a very expensive table next to him. Then Paul Geidel was about to steal the money but then William H. Jackson walked out of the bathroom and to go into more detail William H. Jackson is an old man wearing a very expensive suit and he has short brown hair and a long brown beard. Then William H. Jackson looked at Paul Geidel and started talking to him. Hello young man. Hello Sir. Thank you for bringing my bags in. You are welcome Sir. Then he gave Paul Geidel a small tip and William H. Jackson said to him tell the front desk I want a wakeup call for 8.00 AM because I have a meeting for tomorrow so I will go to bed early tonight. Okay sir. Then Paul Geidel walked out of the room. Outside of the room Paul Geidel walked down a corridor that is nicer then anything Paul Geidel could ever own in 1 million years or 1 million lifetimes and he is thinking to himself about his situation. That man has money and to go into more detail that man has more money than I have had my whole 17 year life and because of that matter I will rob him and maybe I will kill him but only if I have to because I do not want to be arrested for murder and I do not want to stay in prison to when I am in my 80s because I have my whole life in front of me and I do not want to spend the whole of my life in prison. Later at night-time Paul Geidel walked into the hotel room. Inside of the hotel room the hotel room is empty apart from the matter that William H. Jackson is laying on the bed fast asleep. Then Paul Geidel snuck over to the bed which has money next to it. After he snuck over to the bed Paul Geidel reached over for the money without even thinking about it. Then suddenly William H. Jackson woke up and saw Paul Geidel trying to steal his money and because of that matter William H. Jackson started talking to Paul Geidel. So try to steal my money will you I will now tell the front desk to call for a police officer and for that police officer to arrest you for the dirty thief that you are. Then William H. Jackson reached for the phone. Then Paul Geidel stabbed him in the hand. Then Paul Geidel punched him over and over again. Then Paul Geidel suffocated him to death with a rag filled with chloroform. After he was dead Paul Geidel looked at the dead body of William H. Jackson for a moment without doing anything. Then Paul Geidel took the money which is only a few dollars. Then Paul Geidel walked out of the hotel room. Outside of the hotel room Paul Geidel walked down the corridor and started thinking to himself about his situation. I just stole an old man's money and I murdered him and obviously no 1 know that I did it because I am only a bellhop and who would suspect a bellhop of stealing and murdering and because of that I will never be captured by the police and because of that I will continue to rob and murder all over this hotel because once you kill someone you can never stop killing people until you are captured by the police or kills by the police and lucky for me both of those things will not happen to me. The next day at 10:30 AM some business friends of William H. Jackson are wondering because William H. Jackson didn't turn up to a business meeting so because of that William H. Jackson's business friends told some police officers to break down the door of his hotel room. After the police officers broke down the door William H. Jackson's business friends and the police officer saw the dead body of William H. Jackson laying on the bed. Back in 1921 and the police hunted for the killer and because of that the police captured me 2 days later and I was arrested and I was charged with 2nd-degree murder and I was sent to prison for 20 years to life. Out of interest you are never leave prison because of the stupid crime that you committed and also because at prisons they established once a criminal always a criminal and do you agree with that prisoner? I don't know about that sir. Is that a fact prisoner? Then Warden Lawes clapped his hand and 1 of the guards punched Paul Geidel in the left kidney. I said do you agree with that prisoner? Paul Geidel was unclear how to answer the question so Warden Lawes clapped his hand again. Then the guards punched Paul Geidel over and over again and Warden Lawes said do you agree with me prisoner? Then Paul Geidel said yes. Good. Then Warden Lawes looked at the guards and started talking to them. Throw the prisoner back in to his prison cell and make sure he stays there for the rest of the month and make sure he only gets half rations. Then the guards dragged Paul Geidel away. After the guards dragged Paul Geidel away the warden said I love my job and then continue eating his dinner. Back in 1940 and that was me talking to 1 of the prisoners in the 20 years that I have been the warden of Sing Sing Prison. Then Warden Lawes's female secretary walked into the room and to go into more detail she is a different female secretary to the 1 he had in 1920 but she is unimportant as well as that secretary from 1920. Then Warden Lawes's female secretary walked up to Warden Lawes and started talking to him. You must get ready for a meeting in 10 minutes. Then Warden Lawes's female secretary walked out of the room. Then Warden Lawes looked at Walter and his fiancée and continue talking to them. I must continue working now so I might finish this interview later. Then Walter looked at Warden Lawes and continue talking to him. Okay Warden Lawes we will do the interview later. Okay if I am not busy. Then Walter and his fiancée both walked out of the office of the warden of Sing Sing prison. Outside of the office of the warden of Sing Sing prison in the corridor Walter's fiancé said to him that is why I think of him as being a good boss. Really a good boss. Yes. Walter and his fiancée both walked down the corridor talking at the same time and at the moment his fiancé is talking to Walter. Out of interest if you said you will do the interview later by yourself he will say no but if he knows I am going to be there he will say yes because he loves me. Really he does. Yes I have always known that. How long has this been going on for? Since 3 years ago but he would never do anything about it because he is still in love with the memory of his dead wife. Makes sense and out of interest where are we going next he said changing the subject. Next you will interview the electrician who is executed the serial killer. What is his name? His name is Joseph Francel. Where did you say he was again? I said that the executioner was in the execution room. Okay then we will go there and interview the electrician Joseph Francel. Then they both walked over to the execution room of the electrician Joseph Francel. Walter and his fiancée both stopped at the execution room. Then they both walked into the execution room. End of chapter 7[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 the executioner Joseph Francel In the execution room the executioner Joseph Francel is getting the electric chair ready for the serial killer Dr H.p kill to be executed in and to go into more detail the executioner Joseph Francel is middle-aged and about 6 feet tall and has black hair and is wearing a long white lab coat and for obvious reasons shoes that are made of rubber and at the moment the executioner Joseph Francel is talking to the electric chair as he is getting it ready for the serial killer Dr H.p kill to be executed in it and the executioner Joseph Francel does not know that Walter and his fiancée are watching him. Out of interest today you are going to execute the serial killer Dr H.p kill like how you have executed so many people in the past especially with my mentor Robert Elliott in the last decade and the decade before that and out of interest the last time you executed someone was last month on the 12th and that person's name was Benjamin Ertel and he was executed to do with murder and the Governor of New York at the moment Herbert H. Lehman did not even bother allowing him to get away with the execution which obviously you know because as you know the Governor of New York at the moment Herbert H. Lehman was in some way involved with the last 105 executions officially and at least 110 unofficially which will include today's execution starting with the execution of the murderer Charles Bates on the 12th of January 1933 and as you obviously know that was with my mentor Robert Elliott and out of interest I have worked with many electric chairs in this great state but you are my favourite 1. Then Walter and his fiancée both walked over to the executioner Joseph Francel. Then the executioner Joseph Francel turnaround from the electric chair and started a conversation with them. Hello young man and hello miss disease. Hello executioner Francel. Please call me Joseph. Okay Joseph this is the reporter who is here to interview you to do with executed the serial killer. Okay. When do you want the interview to take place said Walter. Right now is fine but I cannot do it for long because obviously I have important business to do because this prison will practically fall down without me. Then Walter and his fiancée both sat down on the floor and the executioner Joseph Francel sat down in the electric chair which is not on at the moment because the executioner Joseph Francel always sits down in the electric chair when he is working. Then Walter looked at the executioner Joseph Francel and continue talking to him. Okay executioner Francel these are the questions and what is your name? My name is Joseph Francel. When was you born? I was born on the 2nd of September 1895. What is your job? My job is I am the state of New York's executioner. When did you start your job? I started my job last year after my mentor Robert Elliott died. Do you remember when you got the job for the 1st time? Yes I do. In a flashback it is slightly after the 10th of October 1939 and Joseph Francel is walked into his new office which used to belong to his old mentor Robert Elliott and to go into more detail it is a small room and the walls are covered with pictures of the people who his old mentor Robert Elliott executed and there are a number of cupboards that are covered with pictures of the people who his old mentor Robert Elliott executed and filing cabinets that are covered with pictures of the people who his old mentor Robert Elliott executed and Joseph Francel is in his new office get ready for his new job which once belonged to his mentor Robert Elliott and he might have a hard time because his mentor was the executioner at the prison for a long time before he died and Joseph Francel must take over where he left off. Later that day some prisoner is in the electric chair getting ready to die for his crimes and he cannot be seen because the execution Joseph Francel is not describe what he looks like to Walter and his fiancée and behind the room with the electric chair in it where the warden Lewis Edward Lawes and some other people are standing and watching the leading up to the execution and at the moment the warden of Sing Sing prison Lewis Edward Lawes is having a conversation with Joseph Francel about the yet to happen execution. This man will die because he deserves it. Yes he does Warden Lawes. Please call me Lewis. Okay Lewis this man does deserve to die because he is a criminal and all criminals deserve to die and that is why he will burn in hell. Yes he will burn in hell after we send him there with the electric chair. Yes we will. A few minutes later the execution of the prisoner with no identity is starting and because of that matter the execution Joseph Francel walked over to the switch and pulled it which turned on the electric chair which electrocuted the prisoner with no identity. After a few minutes the prisoner with no identity was dead. Back in 1940 and that was my 1st day in 1939. Out of interest you said that you got the job after your mentor died. Yes. Can you tell me about him? Yes I can. In a flashback it is somewhere before 1927 in the execution room and Joseph Francel is sitting on the floor and his mentor Robert Elliott is sitting in the electric chair and to go into more detail Joseph Francel's mentor Robert Elliott is a little old man who is wearing a long white lab coat and at the moment he is talking to Joseph Francel. 1 day you will be a good executioner because this is an easy job because all you have to do is put the man or the woman in the electric chair and pull the switch and a few minutes later he or she is dead and you will be famous and you have got rid of some scum who deserves to die which makes the world a better place. Yes it does because these men's and women's are the scum of the earth and they will be destroyed and they will burn in hell for all of eternity for the crimes that they did and that is why this is the world's greatest job because there is no job as good as this 1. That is the right way of looking at it and out of interest very soon I am going to get ready to execute a former police officer called John Brennan for murder and would you like to help me to execute him? I would be delighted to. That is the right idea to have when it comes to execute in the scum of the earth. Back in 1940 and out of interest on a number of occasions in 1926 and 1927 I help my mentor Robert Elliott to execute people mostly unofficially which included the executions of the former police officer called John Brennan for murder on the 2nd of December 1926 and the execution of a man called John Maxwell for murder and robbery on the 9th of December 1926 and the executions of 2 people called Casimir Barszyouk and William Barszyouk for murder and robbery on the 9th of December 1926 and the execution of a man called Charles Goldson for murder and robbery on the 6th of January 1927 and the execution of a man called Edgar Humes for murder and robbery on the 6th of January 1927 and the execution of a man called George Williams for murder and robbery on the 6th of January 1927 and the execution of a man called Benjamin Bradley for murder and robbery on the 13th of January 1927 and the execution of a man called Michael Kosmowski for murder on the 20th of January 1927 and the execution of a man called Paul Hilton for murder on the 17th of February 1927 and the execution of a man called Tony Parretti for a double murder on the 17th of February 1927 and out of interest my mentor Robert Elliott loved to execute people from when he started in 1926 to 1927 when his heart was no longer in it so from 1927 to when he died in 1939 he just did it because he was told to and no longer loved it. Why what happened in 1927? In a flashback it is somewhere in January 1927 and Robert Elliott is in his office surrounded by pictures of the people that he executed in 1926 and 1927 and when he was a employed in the prison service as a regular electrician in that capacity when he assisted Edwin Davis when he was the state electrician in the 1910s especially when it came to Dannemora State Prison in upstate New York. Then Robert Elliott started thinking to himself about the pictures of the people who he executed and assisted in executing. These are the men and women who I killed because I sent a load of innocent men to hell and I only did it to make me rich and to make New York a safer place again but I no longer care about that because I sent to many innocent people to hell and because of that I no longer care about killing any more people but I still will anyway because I cannot give up on my job so easily because New York still needs me. Later in the day in the execution room and Joseph Francel is sitting on the floor and his mentor Robert Elliott is sitting in the electric chair and at the moment he is talking to Joseph Francel. Out of interest young man as you already know I have been doing my job as the 3rd state electrician for the State of New York since last year to do with my predecessor John Hulbert resigning and in the 1910s I insisted the 1st state electrician for the State of New York Edwin Davis especially when it came to Dannemora State Prison in upstate New York but I feel bad about the people who I executed. Why is that? I am about to have a book that I wrote published. What is the book about? My experiences in a book which is called Agent of Death and I am kind of nervous about the publishing of the book. Makes sense apparently that is enough to make you nervous. Yes it is and I feel kind of bad about the people who I executed but do not worry I am not going to have a nervous breakdown like my predecessor John Hulbert last year. Back in 1940 the man called John Hulbert committed suicide in 1929 from shooting himself in the head and that book was successful but he was nervous and out of interest the book was published on the 6th of January 1927 and at that point he carried out the electrocutions of 6 inmates in 2 states officially by the book and about another 20 that was not in the book because they was unofficial and none of those 26 executions was a problem. What was the problem? Shortly after a particular execution a newspaper reported that my mentor Robert Elliott executed a woman called Ruth Snyder in 1928 and that her ghost haunting him and it was reported that my mentor Robert Elliott had problems sleeping because he was paralyzed with guilt. He believed he was haunted by the ghost of a woman who he executed. Yes but he probably was not. Out of interest do you believe in ghosts? No I do not but he did. So you are saying that he believed he was haunted by the ghost of a woman who he executed. Yes I am saying that. In the executioner Joseph Francel's scenario it is 1928 after the newspaper report and it is night time and the executioner Robert Elliott is leading in bed asleep and to go into more detail everything to do with the bedroom of the executioner Robert Elliott is hidden in shadows because the executioner Joseph Francel it not establishing any information about the bedroom of his mentor Robert Elliott because he is only concentrating on his mentor Robert Elliott and nothing around him. Then suddenly the executioner Robert Elliott woke up because he heard a noise. Then the executioner Robert Elliott sat up in bed and saw the ghost of Ruth Snyder who is completely unrecognisable because the executioner Joseph Francel it not establishing anything to do with what she looks like because there is no point really because he does not believe in ghosts. Then the ghost of the unrecognisable Ruth Snyder looked at him and started talking to him. Robert Elliott Robert Elliott you killed me. Yes I did but you deserve it. You murdered me. I did not murder you and if I did have you never heard that expression what comes around goes around and because you was executed for been a murderer. In a flashback in a scenario it is earlier in 1928 before the newspaper report and right before the execution of Ruth Snyder. The still unrecognisable Ruth Snyder is sitting in the electric chair and is having a conversation with the executioner Robert Elliott. How does it feel? How does what feel? Knowing that you are executed an innocent person. You are not innocent and you are getting executed for the murder of your husband. My husband was scum. You and your lover murdered him so you and him could get the life insurance money. In a flashback in a flashback in a scenario it is 1925 and the still unrecognisable Ruth Snyder is talking to her lover Henry Judd Gray a married corset salesman who is unrecognisable. We must kill my husband so we can be together with a load of money and after that we will probably kill your wife. That sounds like a good idea. Yes it does. Back to normal. And we tried to get together because later I assured him and then it was the day of the murder. In a flashback in a flashback in a scenario it is the 20th of March 1927 after she made at least 7 attempts to kill her husband all of which he survived obviously. Her unrecognisable husband is standing in a room and then his unrecognisable wife and her unrecognisable lover grabbed him and his unrecognisable wife Albert Snyder stuffed his nose with a chloroform-soaked rag and then staged his to death made the murder looked like a robbery. Back to normal. And we try to make the murder look like a robbery but unfortunately a detective at the scene noted that the robbery had very little evidence of a robber breaking into the house and because of that it didn't look much like a crime saying. In a flashback in a flashback in a scenario it is the 20th of March 1927 after the murder was committed a detective who is completely unrecognisable is looking around at the evidence which is a broken window and nothing else so because of that the detective is talking to a police officer who is unrecognisable. This is not a robbery. What do you mean there is a window broken and a dead man so it is a robbery. Yes but nothing has been stolen so because of that this is a murder and not a robbery. What do you mean murder? I mean the wife murdered her husband. For what reason would she do that? I don't know yet but I will soon find out the reason why she murdered her husband and when I find out the reason she will go straight to the electric chair at Sing Sing prison for murder. Back to normal. And later the detective established I was guilty especially because my lover admitted to it all and because of that I was thrown into Sing Sing prison because the detective who established that I was guilty and established that I would escape if I would be given the chance to so that was why I was thrown into sing sing prison and made to wait there for my trial and later I had a giant trial and it was considered the trial of the year and the trial was at the Long Island City Courthouse which was visited by a number of famous celebrities who were the actress Peggy Hopkins Joyce and the female writer Mary Roberts Rinehart and the Evangelism Aimee Semple McPherson and the movie director D. W. Griffith and the newspaperman and author Damon Runyon and the writer Will Durant and the singer Nora Bayes and Damon Runyon disparaged the crime's status as a clever attempt at a murder and he nicknamed it \"the dumb-bell murder case\" because \"he was so dumb\" but unfortunately for me and my lover the defence was so cut-throat and me and my love was each contended the 1 who was responsible for killing my husband Albert so because of that me and my lover was both convicted and sentenced to death and here I am waiting for death to take me away for a murder I did not do. If you are looking for pity you are looking in the wrong place so just get ready to die because you deserve to die for murdering your husband. A few minutes later it was time for the execution and Robert Elliott walked over and pulled the switch and the chair turned on and a few minutes later the unrecognisable Ruth Snyder was dead and Robert Elliott said good riddance to bad rubbish. Back in 1928 still in the room where Robert Elliott is still talking to the ghost of the unrecognisable Ruth Snyder. And that is why I do not feel bad about executing you because you was a murder and now you are burning in hell and out of interest you made a man called Tom Howard very happy but there is no point explaining that to you. I don't understand what about the newspaper report? The newspaper report about me caring about people like you is completely wrong I have never cared about people like you and I never will care about people like you because the world is better off without you and the world is better off without you thanks to me executing you. Back in 1940 and that was my mentor Robert Elliott in a particular occasion in 1928 and out of interest young man in the end of the last decade me and my mentor Robert Elliott went to England and met an executioner called Albert Pierrepoint and we assisted him with some of his executions Then the phone on the wall started ringing. Then the executioner Joseph Francel stood up from the electric chair. Then the executioner Joseph Francel walked over to the phone on the wall and answered it. A few minutes later the executioner Joseph Francel walked back to the electric chair. Then the executioner Joseph sat back in the electric chair. Then the executioner Joseph looked at Walter and continue talking to him. Out of interest young man the interview must be finished later because I must do other duties now so goodbye young man and goodbye to you miss disease and then he walked out of the room. Then Walter looked at his fiancée and started talking to her. He was a nice man and everything he said was interesting apart from the stuff he said about his mentor Robert Elliott because that just sounds crazy. Really I established that they was really good storys and I thought his mentor Robert Elliott sounded like a great man. Do you really think the mentor Robert Elliott sounded like a good man? Yes I do because he loved what he did and what he did was execute people and a good man loves what he does and that is a reason why I love you because you love your job and you stop serial killers as well the differences you do not personally kill them like people like Joseph Francel and Robert Elliott. Everything you are saying makes complete sense. Yes it does because it is the true and the truth always make sense. Out of interest what is the next interview? The next interview is a bunch of people who help with the execution. Okay let's go then. Then Walter and his fiancée both walked out of the room. Outside of the room Walter and his fiancée both walked down a corridor to a room where the bunch of people who help with the execution are waiting for the interview. And Walter and his fiancée both stopped at the door. The female prison guard knocked on the door. Then somebody inside the room said come in. Then they both walked into the room. In the room there are 5 assistants to the executioner Joseph Francel sitting around a table waiting for the interview. Then Walter started talking to the 5 assistants to the executioner Joseph Francel. Hello gentlemen I shall doing the interviews 1 at a time in a separate room. Then Walter and his fiancée both walked into a different room. End of chapter 8[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel In the other room Walter and his fiancée sat down at a table. Then the 1st of the assistants of the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel walked into the room and sat down and to go into more detail he is a young man who has black hair and is wearing a long white lab coat. Then Walter looked at the person and started talking to him. We will now begin. Okay by the way hello miss disease. Hello deputy sheriff Hover. Please call me Dow. Okay Dow this is the reporter who is here to interview you to do with executed the serial killer Dr H.p kill. Okay. When do you want the interview to take place said Walter. Right now is fine but I cannot do it for long because I am only here for the day and then I must go back to my other job. Okay then these are the questions what is your name? My name is Dow Hover. When was you born? I was born somewhere before 1901 in New York City. What is your job? My job is I am a deputy sheriff for Columbia County but occasionally I work here as an assistant to Joseph Francel. How long has that been going on for? I have been a native and lifelong resident of Germantown which led to me worked as a deputy sheriff for Columbia County but I don't remember when because it was so long ago and I have only been working here for a short time and don't really have anything to say for the interview. A few minutes later the 2nd of the assistants of the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel walked into the room and sat down and to go into more detail he looks like he is middle age who has black hair and is wearing a long white lab coat. Then Walter looked at the person and started talking to him. We will now begin these are the questions what is your name? My name is Edward box. When was you born? I was born on the 3rd of January 1870 in Brooklyn New York which was on the same day at the same time as the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge started. What is your job? My job is I work here as an assistant to the executioner who at the moment is Joseph Francel. When did you start your job? I started my job when the 1st state electrician for the State of New York Edwin Davis killed his 1st prisoner William Kemmler in 1890. Do you remember that particular execution? Yes I do. In a flashback it is the 6th of August 1890 in a completely white and completely empty corridor in Auburn Prison in Auburn in New York the executioner Edwin Davis and Edward box are standing against a wall smoking cigarettes and to go into more detail the executioner Edwin Davis is fat and old and is wearing a black suit and at the moment he is talking to Edward box. Out of interest young man today I am going to pull the switch on a new invention. What is it? It is a new way to kill people. I don't understand what do you mean a new way to kill people? Let me explain it slowly as you know in 1860 the New York Legislature passed a bill which abolished capital punishment in the state by repealing hanging as a method of execution without prescribing an alternative method. That is right that worked. Yes it did and the bill was signed by Governor Edwin D. Morgan in April 1860 and the New York Court of Appeals ruled the statute unconstitutional and Governor Morgan signed legislation to restore the death penalty in 1861 and again in 1862 to fully repeal the earlier statute. Yes I know all of that and I asked about the new invention. I am getting to that. When are you getting to that? Right now and you was out of the country at the time in the late 1880s. Yes I was fighting in a war and to go into more detail I was in the Mahdist War from the 12th of August 1881 when I was 11-years-old and that was to do with the Battle of Aba to when I was injured in the Battle of Gallabat on the 10th of March last year when I was 19-years-old. There you would not know about the matter that in 1887 New York State established a committee to determine a new more humane system of execution to replace hanging and because of that a man called Alfred P. Southwick who is a member of the committee who out of interest is coming to today's execution developed the idea of putting electric current through a device such as a chair after hearing about how hitting someone with electricity will lead to instant death because apparently he heard about a drunken man died because the drunk man touching exposed power lines and another reason why Alfred P. Southwick crated the machine is because Alfred P. Southwick is a dentist and because he uses a chair which should have electric current to operate it because chairs at the dentists are used without electricity because they are just normal chairs and because of that Alfred P. Southwick got the idea to put the electricity through the chair to execute people and that is what he eventually is an electric chair which executes people and everything I am saying is the idea of the invention I am using today. But will it work? It probably will. But is it as humane as everybody says it is? Probably not. Why do you think that is? Well when the person was sentenced to death by hanging they died instantly to do with the matter that they fell down with a rope around their neck which led to those people dying instantly most of the time but with this new invention they probably will suffer for minutes while being electrocuted for a long time because of that I say no to the question about this new invention being humane or not but I cannot say my opinion out loud because everybody believe that the new invention is humane and if I say my opinion out loud I will be fired from my new job of being the state electrician for the State of New York a concept I really love because I love the concept of being an executioner and killing people who deserve to die and hopefully I have a long history when it comes to executing people who deserve to die. Later in the day it is time for the execution which is in a big room with a load of people watching including the inventor Alfred P. Southwick who is there to make sure that his new invention actually works and to go into more detail the inventor Alfred P. Southwick is a little old man wearing a very expensive suit and he has short white hair and a long white beard. Then the inventor Alfred P. Southwick stood up from his chair and walked into the middle of the room and started talking to the audience. Ladies and gentlemen you have the rare opportunity to witness a great invention because this new invention will kill prisoners who are criminals and deserved to die which includes today's person who is a very terrible criminal who deserves to die for his many terrible thing such as murder and I believe that everybody in this room would like to see a murder die in this chair. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. Okay people the criminal's name is William Kemmler and today he will die. Then William Kemmler was taken into the room and put into the chair and to go into more detail William Kemmler is about 6 feet tall and has long black hair and a long black beard and he is wearing a prison uniform. Then Edwin Davis stood up from his chair and attacked William Kemmler to the electric chair. Then Edwin Davis sat back down. Then in the chair William Kemmler was looking around the room. Then the inventor Alfred P. Southwick sat back down in his chair. Then Edwin Davis stood up from his chair and walked into the middle of the room and started talking to the audience. Okay people I am the person who is going to turn on this invention which will kill the criminal. Then Edwin Davis looked at William Kemmler and started talking to him. Okay do you have any last words? Then William Kemmler then started talking to the audience. Yes I do have some last words to say and my last words are Gentlemen I wish you all good luck I believe I am going to a good place and I am ready to go. Then Edwin Davis looked at the audience and started talking again. Let me go into more detail about this criminal if you people wish to hear about a criminal's life before he died. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. Okay then I will say the information about the criminal who is about to die like it has been already established and like it has already been established the criminal's name is William Kemmler and he is getting executed for murder and to go into more detail the criminal is getting executed for the murder of his common-law wife with a hatchet on the 29th of March 1889 and because he did that he was sentenced to death by electrocution at New York's Auburn Prison and that is why he is right here right now getting executed for murder because only criminals die in the electric chair because people who are not criminals do not die in the electric chair. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. And because of that I see that you all agree with me and that is why I will now hurry up and pull the switch and make this man die and send him straight to hell where he belongs because if you murder someone you go straight to hell and this criminal murdered someone so because so that he is going straight to hell. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. I am so glad that all of you agree with me and that is why the execution was start right this second. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. Then Edwin Davis walked to the switch on the wall. Then Edwin Davis pulled the switch on the wall which caused the invention to turn on. And because the invention was turned on current was passed through William Kemmler's body for 17 seconds and then the power was turned off. Then Edwin Davis stood up from his chair and walked into the middle of the room and started talking to the audience again. Okay people this medical man will make sure that the criminal is dead. Then a man called Dr. Edward Charles who is about average height and very average looking walked up to the electric chair and starting checking if William Kemmler was dead. A few minutes later the medical man Dr. Edward Charles walked up to Edwin Davis and whispered into his ear. Then Edwin Davis started talking to the audience again. Okay people the medical man has just said that the murderer William Kemmler is now dead. Then somebody in the audience stood up and shouted out he is still because I can still see him briefing. Then Dr. Edward Charles walked up to the electric chair and starting checking if William Kemmler was dead again. A few minutes later the medical man Dr. Edward Charles walked up to Edwin Davis and whispered into his ear. Then Edwin Davis started talking to the audience again. Okay people the medical man has just said that the murderer William Kemmler is still alive and that is why I will electrocute him again but this time I will turn up the volume on the electric chair. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. Then Edwin Davis walked up to a device on the electric chair of which made the power go up and he turned it to 2,000 volts. Then Edwin Davis walked to the switch on the wall. Then Edwin Davis pulled the switch on the wall which caused the invention turn on again. And because the invention was turned on current was passed through William Kemmler's body which made blood pour out of his head because all of the blood vessels in his head was bursting underneath the 2,000 volts and a bunch of veins on his face started to burst and blood was pouring down his face and his prison uniform set on fire and then his body was on fire as well and the flash on his body started to cook under the fire and then smoke come out of his body as the flesh on his body was cooking underneath the fire. After a few minutes William Kemmler was actually dead to do with the matter that his body was completely burnt because his body was completely covered in fire which made him die even faster than the electric. Then Edwin Davis stood up from his chair and walked into the middle of the room and started talking to the audience again. Okay people the medical man does not have to checking if William Kemmler is dead because obviously he is dead which is good riddance to bad rubbish because he deserved to die and everybody in this audience agrees with that don't you? Then everybody in the audience started clapping. I see you all love the execution and I really love the execution because the criminal is dead which makes this the most greatest job in the world because I get to kill people like William Kemmler because they deserve to die. Then everybody in the audience started clapping. Back in 1940 and out of interest the New York Times reported instead that an Bad smell came out of the dead body which was to do with the matter that his flesh was cooking underneath the fire and everybody in the audience said that they love the day that they all saw the very 1st time someone was executed with the electric chair which by the way was a very good thing to see because an evil man like William Kemmler deserve to die and that is completely what happened and because of that everybody had a good day especially me because I got to work with the great man Edwin Davis when he was using the electric chair for the first 1st in 1890 and out of interest people cannot work with Edwin Davis anymore because he died on the 26th of May 1923. It did sound like a great day because the electric chair was invented which killed people who deserve to die which includes the serial killer dying today especially because I help the police to find him. Everything you are saying is completely correct and now I must go because of my job to do with the executions today. A few minutes later the 3rd of the assistants of the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel walked into the room and sat down and to go into more detail he looks like he is in his 40s and has brown hair and is wearing a long white lab coat. Then Walter looked at the person and started talking to him. We will now begin these are the questions what is your name? My name is Ronnie s cold. When was you born? I was born on the 17th of January 1770 in Great Britain which was on the same day at the same time as British troops clash with American colonists at the Battle of Golden Hill to do with the American Revolutionary War. What is your job? My job is that I have been working here since when the prison was 1st opened in 1826 so since then I have had hundreds of jobs but at the moment I am 1 of the assistants to the executioner. When did you start your job? I started the assistant job to the executioner Joseph Francel since earlier this year. You have been working here since the prison opened in 1826. Yes and the other 2 what was built by New York State before Sing Sing prison was built in 1826. Do you mind explaining that? Okay I will Sing Sing prison was the 3rd prison built by New York State. Was it really the 3rd prison built by New York State? Yes the 1st prison Newgate Prison was built in 1797 in Greenwich Village and is no longer around because it was destroyed in the 1820s and a 2nd 1 was built in 1816 and was called Auburn State Prison and it is still around and I work at both of them when they 1st opened. You was there when Sing Sing prison 1st opened in 1826. Yes I was and me and the warden of Auburn Prison and former Army captain Elam Lynds was both told about when the prison was 1st thought about being built in 1824. In a flashback it is 1824 in the early hours of the morning in a completely dark corridor in Auburn Prison Ronnie s cold and Elam Lynds who is middle age and quite short are having a conversation. Apparently in New York State they are built a new prison. Really another 1? Yes and they want me to be the warden of the new prison. Yes but you are already the warden of Auburn Prison. Yes but I what to be the warden of the new prison and I want you to be my co-warden of the new prison. Back in 1940 and out of interest I was his co-warden during the years he was warden for. So the prison was an idea in 1824. Yes the prison was an idea in 1824 and it was opened in 1826 and it was completed in 1828 and like I just said I was the co-warden of the prison during the years that Elam Lynds was the warden of the prison which was from 1825 to 1830 and I was also the co-warden for a number of other wardens. How long did that last for? I was the co-warden of this prison from 1824 to when I retired in 1920 and again from 1925 to when I retired again in 1930 and since 1930 and 1 of the wardens that I was co-to and 1 of my friends was Lewis E. Lawes. The warden of sing sing prison at the moment. Yes like he properly told you when you interviewed him he has been the warden of the prison from 1920 to present so that means when I was a co-warden from 1825 to 1930 to my friends Lewis E. Lawes as well. Makes sense. So like I was just about to say earlier from 1930 to the beginning of this year my friends Lewis E. Lawes keeps trying to talk me into making me the co-warden of sing sing prison again but I turned him down every time that he brings it up to me. Yes but you are 1 of the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel. Yes that is because I turned down the job of the co-warden of sing sing prison for 10 years and Warden Lawes finally got the idea that I didn't want the job so he offered me this job I am doing at the moment and I accepted it. In a flashback it is early 1940 at the home of Ronnie s cold and to go into more detail about the home of Ronnie s cold it is very big and has existed since the early 1790s when it was built by Ronnie s cold personally and at the moment Ronnie s cold is sitting in his favourite chair that has existed since the early 1790s in his front room and to go into more detail about the front room of Ronnie s cold it is very big and it 100% looks like what it did in the early 1790s and that is because of a unknown reason and at the moment Ronnie s cold is talking to Lewis E. Lawes. I have told you before that I do not want the job as the co-warden of sing sing prison anymore. And I have somehow established that and out of interest this is a new job that I am offering you. What is the new job? The new job is that you will be 1 of the assistants to the executioner Joseph Francel. Okay but 1st I must think it over before I decide to do anything. Take as long as you want but the new job is better than your last job because this job you will be helping the executioner Joseph Francel kills someone who deserves to die. That is a very good reason why I will do the job and I will probably do the job. Yes you will because it is a good job and you would be very good at the job because the job needs a very good person to do the job and you are the very good person for the job. Okay you talk me into it I will do the job. Good you can start the job soon because I need you straight away because you are a good friend of mine and I do not want you just hanging around the house doing nothing. That is a very good point and that is why I will do the job. Back to normal. And that was when my friend Lewis E. Lawes 1st offered me the job as 1 of the assistants to the executioner Joseph Francel which is a job which I really love because it is a very good job and I sometimes think it is better than my old job as the co-warden of sing sing prison from 1825 to 1930 and now I am now finished talking. A few minutes later the 4th of the assistants of the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel walked into the room and sat down and to go into more detail he is wearing a military uniform from the war in Germany in the 1910s and he has white hair. Then the person looked at the fiancée and started talking to her. Hello honey. Hello dad. You are here Dr Disease. Yes me and Dr H.p kill was friends and I thought he was a good doctor but I was wrong so because of that I will be glad to help with the execution. You and Dr H.p kill was friends. Yes we was in the army in 1913 and we fought in the war in Germany in the 1910s together and we was at medical school together and we both own part of a hospital together. How does all of that work? Well I was born on the 1st of January 1900 in London in England and he was born on the 1st of January 1899 in London in England. So he was a year older. Yes he was and out of interest I was 13 and he was 14 in 1913 when we 1st met when me and him join the army and later we went to fight in the war in Germany which was from 1914 to 1918 and we was there from when the war started in 1914 to when the war ended in 1918 and then we went to medical school together in London from 1918 to 1924 and we both own part of a hospital from 1924 to last year when I went over to Germany to talk to some of the troops because it was a programme to help some English soldiers by establishing how the soldiers in the war in Germany in the 1910s did it so the soldiers in the new war in Germany will know how to do it which was very successful for them so they might win the war in Germany at the moment. Will you enjoy the execution? Probably to put scum like him to death and it is a good thing and the matter that he used to be my friend means nothing to me and out of interest will you and my daughter go and witness the execution? Yes we properly will witness the execution tonight. That is good my boy you and my daughter will enjoy the execution. Yes we probably will. That is good. A few minutes later the 5th of the assistants of the 5 assistants to Joseph Francel walked into the room and sat down and to go into more detail he appears to be a little old man with white hair and a long white lab coat. Then Walter looked at the person and started talking to him. We will now begin. Okay by the way hello miss disease. Hello Dr Killing. Please called me James. Okay James this is the reporter who is here to interview you to do with executed the serial killer Dr H.p kill. Okay. When do you want the interview to take place said Walter. Right now is fine but I cannot do it for long to do with the execution that is later today. We will now begin with the questions what is your name? My name is Dr James Killing. When were you born? I was born on the 1st of January 1900. What is your job? My job is I work here as an assistant to the executioner and I am a doctor/surgeon at a local hospital. When did you start your job? It started in 1938 and before that I was a doctor in Germany from 1934 to 1938 and before that I worked in another hospital from 1930 to 1934 and before then I worked in a different hospital from 1925 to 1930 and before that I was at medical school in London from 1918 to 1924. That is weird because my fiancée's father went to medical school in London and you probably knew him. Yes I did young man because that is where I met your fiancée's father and Dr H.p kill and another friend of mine Dr Kills who was also there but your father and Dr H.p kill never met him and before that me and Dr kills was in the army in Germany in the war in Germany from 1914 to 1918 but we was in a different part to the part that your fiancée's father and Dr H.p kill was in. Are you said that Dr H.p kill is not a killer? Not really the man is a killer and deserves to die that is why I was brought on the case because in Germany I am a great surgeon and a great Doctor and that is why I am the best man for the job no offence to your yet to become father-in-law and no offence to my boss Joseph Francel and no offence to any of the other assistants to my boss Joseph Francel. There is no insult said Dr Disease who walked into the room. Hello Dr Disease. Are you talking about when me and Dr H.p kill and you and your friend who me and Dr H.p kill never met during the years you and him worked it the hospital me and Dr H.p kill owned part of and when you and him was at medical school with me and Dr H.p kill? Yes I am talking about old times. Good we will talk about old times in my laboratory. I don't understand the 3 said at the same time. You 3 are coming back to my house/my laboratory to talk about old times and other stuff and after that I will take you 3 back here with the execution is happening and I will not take no for an answer. My new recruit to the newspaper is in the car said Walter. Take him along. Okay I will take him along. Then all 4 of them walked out of the room. Outside of the room all 4 of them walked down the corridor. Then Walter looked at Dr Disease and started talking to him. Do you mind if I invite another guest? Okay young man. Then Walter stopped in the corridor and walked up to his friend Jimmy and started talking to him. Hello Jimmy me and my fiancé and my fiancé's father and an assistant to the executioner and my new recruit are going back to my fiancé's father's place and do you want to come? Yes I do. That is very good to hear. Then all of them walked down the corridor and out of the front door. All 5 of them are outside. Excuse me for a minute said Walter. Then 4 of them got into the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease and Walter walked over to his car where the new recruit to the newspaper is asleep. In a dream sequence it is somewhere over 20 years in the future so in other words in the 1960s in the newspaper place the future version of the new recruit to the newspaper who at the moment is a professional reporter is sitting at his desk writing down information about himself. Out of interest I have been a newspaper reporter since the early 1940s and since the 1940s I have reported on many things that have happened in that time such as the end of the war in Germany which Germany lost and the death of Adolf Hitler and the death of Nazism in Nazi Germany which is now just called Germany and out of interest I am happy I am not a soldier like my deceased father who has been dead since the middle of the 1940s and my deceased great-grandfather who died in the American Civil War in the 1860s and his deceased brother who died in the American Civil War in the 1860s and out of interest as a reporter I can investigate a number of serial killer cases just like my old friend and partner Walter who died in the early 1940s as well and I can investigate a number of famous unsolved mysteries such as the identity of the English serial killer Jack the Ripper who murdered his victims mostly in 1888 and a particular unsolved murder that happened in 1947 to do with a man called John P. St. John and some murders to do with a man called detective Simon killing and some murders to do with a man called Douglas kill-not and a number of crimes that happened on the English island S C Island in the many years it has existed especially when it comes to a number of people like a man called Douglas cookie and a vampire called Bill and a number of serial killers who murdered people for fun and a concept of criminals been above the law and an unsolved murder from Greenfield in Bedfordshire from 1939 and the victim's name was George Stapleton and an unsolved murder from Brighton in England from 1934 and that murder is known as the Brighton Trunk Crime no. 1 and an unsolved murder from Aldershot in Hampshire from 1931 and the victim's name was Hubert Chevis and an unsolved murder from Liverpool in England from 1931 that is called the Wallace Case and a number of disappearances such as the 1856 mysterious disappearance of a man called Matias Perez and the 1872 mysterious disappearance of the crew of the British merchant brigantine Mary Celeste and the 1890 mysterious disappearance of the movie director Louis Le Prince and the 1913 mysterious disappearance of the writer Ambrose Bierce. Then the new recruit woke up from Walter saying to him wake up you lazy bum. Then the new recruit looked at Walter and started talking to him. Hello boss. 2 things and Number 1 I am not your boss I am your partner and Number 2 get up we are all going to my fiancée's father's house. Okay let's go and he got out of the car and Walter locked the car and both of them walked over to the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease and got in to it. End of chapter 9[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 inside of a horse and carriage In the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease Walter's fiancée and her father and the security guard and Dr Killing are sitting around in the carriage. Then Walter looked at the new recruit. These are the people who are coming to the laboratory. Everybody in the carriage looked at them. Okay everybody this is the new recruit to the newspaper and his name is George. Then he introduced them. That is my fiancé. Hello George. And that is my fiancé father Dr Disease. Hello young man. And that is Dr Killing. Hello young man. And you know the security guard who wouldn't let you in the prison earlier. Hello George. Then Walter sat down sat next to his fiancée and George sat next to Dr Killings and started a conversation with him. Hello Dr Killing are you and Dr Disease friends? Yes we are and we have been ever since we 1st met in 1918 when we met at a medical school in London. In a flashback it is the 14th of November 1918 and the future Dr Killing is in a laboratory in medical school cutting up a dead body and to go into more detail the laboratory is very big and expensive and he filled up with brand-new medical equipment that obviously existed in the 1910s and in the laboratory there are a number of dead bodies that are dead Germans from the war in Germany in the 1910s on metal tables and at the moment the future Dr Killing is standing next to a dead body of a German from the war in Germany in the 1910s on a metal table and the future Dr Killing is cutting open the dead body of the German from the war in Germany in the 1910s on the metal table for fun. Then the future Dr Disease walked up to him and started a conversation. Hello my name is peanut disease. Hello peanut my name is Henry Howard killing. Hello h-h how long have you been at this medical school for? Since today why how long have you been at this medical school for? Since today I left the war in Germany the other day. That is weird because I was in the war as well and I also left the war the other day. Are you here alone h-h? No I am here with my friend who also was in the war because that is how we met. That is weird because I am also here with a friend who I met in the war. That is a weird coincidence. Yes it is and out of interest what is your friend called? My friend is called Simon kills why what is your friend called? My friend is called Hawks Peter kill. That is weird 2 kills. Yes it is kind of weird. Where is your friend at the moment? At the moment he is in the bathroom why where is your friend? He is cutting up a dead body in a different room to do with a different reason. Back in 1940 and that is all I can remember when it comes to that meeting in 1918. That is weird that you mentioned your friend Dr kills. Why is that weird? It is weird because I met him earlier. Dr Killing paused for a minute. Then Dr Killing started talking again. Out of interest young man what do you mean you met him earlier? I bumped into him outside of the prison when I was waiting for Walter. You bumped into him. Yes I did he said he was looking for you but he then said he got his days mixed up and your friend believed you was at a different places today and he said it was too bad it was your day off which out of interest was too bad for him that he didn't know you was in there. Yes it is bad that I missed him but unfortunately he has a habit of mixing up his days. That is bad. You will find it happens when you get old. You are probably right. Yes I am young man because I would know because I am old. A few minutes later they all arrived at Dr Disease's mention. All 6 People got out of the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease and to go into more detail the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease is very big and black and expensive and covered in gold and it has existed since a unknown year in the 1920s and the inside of it is covered with black silk. Outside of the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease all 6 People walked to Dr Disease's mansion. Then Dr Disease knocked on the door. Then a servant open the door. Then all 6 People walked into Dr Disease's mansion and to go into more detail Dr Disease's mansion is very big and black and expensive and covered in gold and it has existed since an unknown year in the 1770s. End of chapter 10[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 Dr Disease's mansion Inside of Dr Disease's mansion all 6 People walked into Dr Disease's laboratory. Inside of Dr Disease's laboratory and to go into more detail Dr Disease's laboratory is very big and black and expensive and is filled up with equipment that dates as far back as the 1910s and all 6 people all sat down at a giant table that is usually used for meetings and important discussions and that has-been happening with different tables in the same spot with the same concept since about the 1790s and Dr Disease started talking to everybody. Hello everybody I brought you here to have a discussion about the execution and some other stuff and it will be done by me asking individual people about stuff that I and other people actually care about and it will begin now with what I call my question game and sometimes I refer to it as my old game which people like my daughter and Dr Killing have already played. Then Dr Disease looked at Walter and started talking to him. How long have you been a reporter for? I have been a reporter at the newspaper since 1935 when my predecessor Lee Taylor was murdered. How was he murdered? He was murdered by being shot in the head at his house when he lived with his wife who was also murdered by being shot in the head. Did the police catch the killer? No they did not and his murder case is still open. Can you go into more detail about your 1st day in 1935? Yes I can. In a flashback it is 1935 and it is Walter 1st day and Walter is walked into a big room filled with young men sitting at desks with typewriters and smoking cigarettes and because of that the room is filled with smoke and Walter looked around at the very busy and very loud and smoke filled room. Then inside of the room Walter bumped into someone and to go into more detail is very tall and is very skinny and has brown hair and is wearing overalls and is nobody important. Then Walter started talking to the person. I am sorry about that. That is okay and you must be new. Yes I am and my name is Walter Garrett and I was a reporter somewhere else before I started here. Where was you a reporter for? I was a reporter for a number of places around the world but hopefully this will be the best place I have ever worked for and make me never want to go anywhere else. That is a very good point and out of interest was you really a reporter for a number of places around the world? Yes I was and I should tell you all of the details about it and I should tell you all of my stories about all the places I went to around the world some time. I would like that. Can you tell me where my desk is? Yes I can and it is over there. Then he pointed at a desk in the corner. Walter walked over and sat down at the desk which is filled with paperwork of cases. Then the reporter walked over to Walter and continue talking to him. You are here to replace a recently murdered reporter named Lee Taylor. What kind of reporter was he? What do you mean what kind of reporter was he? I don't understand your question. Are you asking me what sort of man was he or are you asking me what sort of news did he put in the newspaper? I am asking what sort of news did he put in the newspaper. The answer is he mostly did murders and he also helped the police solve the murders and because you are his replacement you will do the same thing. Are you saying I have to help the police to solve murders as part of my job? Yes I am and you will start very soon because murders do not solve themselves especially when you are helping people to solve the murders. Back in 1940 and that is how I got my job as a reporter at the newspaper in 1935. And that is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Walter's fiancé which is also his daughter and started talking to her. Okay honey tell the people how long you have been a prison guard at sing sing prison for. Okay daddy I have been a prison guard at sing sing prison since 1934 when I was 14-years-old. Okay honey tell the people have your 1st day was. Okay daddy I got the job because I wanted the job and you got me the job because you are friends with the warden of sing sing prison and you have been since sometime in the 1920s and if you go into more detail the warden of sing sing prison Lewis E. Lawes is my godfather and he fancies me and because he is my godfather and because he fancies me I got the job of a prison guard at sing sing prison in 1934 and out of interest the warden of sing sing prison Lewis E. Lawes did not fancy me when I was 14-years-old in 1934 he did not start fancies me until 1937 when I was 17-years-old to do with his wife dying but because he is a gentleman and because of the memory of his dead wife he would never do anything about it. In a flashback it is 1934 and Dr Disease's daughter whose name is Courtenay Disease is sitting in the office of the warden of sing sing prison Lewis E. Lawes at his desk and at the moment Lewis E. Lawes is talking to Courtenay as he is writing down some information about her. Hello Courtenay because you want a job at my prison I must ask you some questions. Okay then start asking your questions. Okay then I will and because of that matter I will establish your name is Courtenay Disease and you are 14-years-old and you was born on the 1st of January 1920 and you was born in a hospital in London in England and out of interest what job would you like? I would like the job as a prison guard at this prison. Usually if a woman asked me if they could be a prison guard at my prison I would say no but because your father is an old friend of mine and I am your godfather I will say yes and you can have the job as a prison guard at my prison. That is very good and out of interest when can I start? You may start today unofficially and you may begin officially next month. Both of those things are very good to hear especially the 2nd 1. Later in the day Courtenay is walking down a corridor in the prison. Then Courtenay walked into an interview room. Inside of the interview room there is a man who is handcuffed to a table and to go into is unrecognisable Courtenay care so little about the person she is not bothering to establish what he looks like in her story. Then the unrecognisable man looked at Courtenay. Hello can you help me? I am here to guard you not to have a conversation with you. Fine then I will talk to myself that. Please yourself. Then unrecognisable man said his name but Courtenay does not establish what it is in her story but the unrecognisable man does say his other information. I am 25-years-old and I was born on the 23rd of March 1909 apparently at the same time as the at that moment in time former 26th President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt left New York to go to what is referred to as the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition and out of interest I have been accused with 20 murders and if found guilty I will be sent to the electric chair. Whatever. Later in the day the unrecognisable man is tied down in the electric chair waiting to be executed and Courtenay is standing right in front of him and at the moment the unrecognisable man is talking to Courtenay. How about it? How about what? How about looking in the eye of a man who is about to be executed? Okay. Then Courtenay looked into the eyes of the unrecognisable man for a moment without doing anything else. A few minutes later Courtenay is standing in the room where the warden stands when the execution takes place and at the moment Lewis E. Lawes is talking to Courtenay about the execution. Out of interest young lady because today is your unofficial 1st day you are watching an execution but that is not going to be part of your main job because your main job is to do with transferring prisoners from 1 cell to another cell and out of interest you have to use the very small break room for female prison guards and numerous other things that female prison guards use (even though there are no other female prison guards) That sounds very good. That is the right idea. A few minutes later the executioner Robert G. Elliott walked over and pulled the switch. The unrecognisable man began to be electrocuted. Then the unrecognisable man burst into flames. A few minutes later the unrecognisable man died from burning to death. A few hours later Courtenay is talking to the executioner Robert G. Elliott and to go into more detail at the moment Courtenay is sitting on the floor near to the electric chair and the executioner Robert G. Elliott is sitting in the electric chair which is something that he teaches Joseph Francel how to do because he learnt it off his mental as well. Out of interest executioner does that happen a lot? Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't it is just 1 of those things which does not matter because he deserved to die because he was a murderer and murderers deserve to die and because he was a murderer and he deserved to die he got everything what's was coming to him. Back in 1940 and that is how I got the job as a prison guard at sing sing prison in 1934 and also how my 1st day was and that is also the 1st time I looked into the eyes of a person right before they was executed. And that is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Walter again and started talking to him again. Out of interest young man can you go into more detail about that statement you made? What statement do you mean? The statement that you was a reporter for a number of places around the world before 1935. You want me to go into more detail about the matter I have been a reporter in a number of places around the world. Yes I do. Okay then I have been a reporter since about February 1916 when I was 12-years-old in London in England to do with a lack of men to do with the war in Germany and that job went on from 1916 to when the war ended in 1918 and because of that matter I did stories to do with the war in Germany in the 1910s such as the beginning of the war in Germany in 1914 and information about the war in Germany to do with 1914 and information about the war in Germany to do with 1915 and information about the Battle of Asiago that was in Asiago plateau in Veneto in Italy and was to do with the Italian Front

information about Russian in the war in Germany in the 1910s and then I was a reporter in San Francisco in California and I was there from 1920 to 1922 where I did stories about things that previously had already happened like the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1915 San Francisco world's fair and then I was a reporter in Toronto in Canada and I was there from 1922 to 1924 where I did stories

Edson Taylor in 1901 and Bobby Leach in 1911 and the people who went over Niagara Falls and died like Ed Delahanty in 1903 and Charles Stephens in 1920 and then I was a reporter in Adams County in Mississippi and I was there from 1924 to 1926 where I did stories about things that previously had already happened to do with things like the founding of the place in 1799 and some information about Mississippi and when it was added to the admission to the Union in 1817 when it was the Territory of Mississippi and then I was a reporter on the English island S C Island from 1926 to 1928 where I did stories about things that previously had already happened to do with things like the vampire wars that started in the year 1010 and the year-long hunted house parties in the haunted house on the Hill in the years 1890 and 1900 and 1910 and 1920 and then I was a reporter in Washington, D.C in America and I was there from 1928 to 1930 where I did stories about things that previously had already happened to do with things like a number of the landmarks in Washington, D.C such as the Washington Monument that started to be built in 1848 and was finished in 1884 and the Lincoln Memorial that was built from 1914 to 1922 and a number of other landmarks that are to do with long dead Presidents of the United States and then in 1930 I went to Norway and helped out with the Bratvaag Expedition and then I was a reporter in Sergipe in Brazil and I was there in 1931 and when I was there I did not do much in the way of writing and then I was a reporter in Hamburg in Germany and I was there in 1932 and when I was there I did not do much in the way of writing especially not to do with the war in Germany in the 1910s and then I was a reporter in Victoria in Australia and I was there from 1932 to 1933 where I did a bunch of stuff to do with the history of Australia especially in the 1800s where people was sent there and then I was a reporter in Hong Kong in China and I was there from 1933 to 1934 where I did a bunch of stuff to do with the history of China especially to do with the many dynasties such as the Qing dynasty from 1644 to 1911 and the Ming dynasty from 1368 to 1644 and the Yuan dynasty from 1271 to 1368 and earlier ones and then I was a reporter in Honolulu County in Hawaii and I was there from 1934 to 1935 where I did not do a lot of writing and like I have already said in 1935 I started working at the newspaper I am working for at the moment and that is the list of places that I have worked for as a reporter around the world. Are those all of them? Kind of because I work for those places and some others during working for those places and that is mostly it. And that is good. Then Dr Disease looked at the prison guard who is friends with Walter and started talking to him. How long have you been a guard at sing sing prison? I was hired in 1935. How long have you been friends with my soon to be son-in-law. Me and your soon to be son-in-law has been friends since we 1st met in 1935. In a flashback it is 1935 not long after when Walter and the guard was both hired at both of their job in 1935 and Walter is walking into the prison. Then suddenly the guard stopped him. My name is on the list. Is your name really on the list? Yes it is. What is your name? My name is Walter Garrett. Then the guard looked at him. You are the newspaper reporter who did all those stories in Russia and China and a number of other places around the world. Yes I am and out of interest what is your name? My name is Jimmy man. Well hello Jimmy he said putting a cigarette into his mouth and lighting it with a match. Then the guard pulled out a cigarette and put it into Walter's mouth and lighting it with a match. Back in 1940 and we have been friends ever since we 1st met in 1935. And that is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Walter again and started talking to him again. Out of interest young man what is the most important crime you ever helped solve in the 24 years that you have been a reporter for? Okay then the most important crime I ever helped solve in the 24 years that I have been a reporter for was last year. Out of interest can you say the details of the crime? Yes I can and I will say the details of the crime. That is good. Last year I helped the police catch a monster who killed 2 people and drained them of there rare blood types. Did you find who did it? Yes I did and it was done by a man who was recently executed for allowing a 10-year-old child to die of starvation and bought back to life and the rare blood types kept him alive which didn't save him from dying by being shot by the police. What was his name? His name was Dr Xavier but he was usually referred to as Doctor X. He sounded like a monster and it is good he is dead and it is very good that you help the police to shoot him down like the mad dog that he sounds like. Yes it is. And that is good. Then Dr Disease looked at the new recruit to the newspaper and started talking to him. What was you doing in the car when your partner was in the prison? I was on a 2-way radio talking to my brother in law. Why do you have a 2-way radio if they are only for the army? My brother in law is in the army. Really what rank is he? He is a General in the United States Army. How long has he been fighting? He has been fighting since 1931 and he has been my brother-in-law since 1934 when he married my sister. He sounds like a very important man. Yes he is because he is very high up in the arm but he is not as important as my dad. Really what rank is your father? Technicality from a while he was a Colonel in the Regular Army but recently he was made into a Brigadier General in the Army of the United States. That is impressive. Yes over their he is a Great War hero because he was in the war in Germany in the 1910s as well and he is in the war in Germany at the moment and because of that my father's name is known around the world because he is just that famous and he is supposed to be a great man even though he is not a great man he is still known around the world and that is why his name is so famous. Out of interest young man what is your father's name? My father's name is. Right before the new recruit to the newspaper was about to say his father's name there was a knock on the door. Then Dr Disease stood up walked out of the room. A few minutes later Dr Disease walked back into the room. Then Dr Disease looked everybody and started talking to them. Apparently the execution is in 2 hours and you must get ready to go to it. And because of that all of them walked out of the room. Outside of the room all of them walked out of Dr Disease's mansion. Outside of Dr Disease's mansion all of them got into the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease. Then the horse and carriage belonging to Dr Disease drove away. End of chapter 11[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 going back to sing sing prison Sometime later all of them are still sitting in the horse and carriage which is stuck in traffic and because of that Dr Disease cleared his throat and continue talking to everybody. This is a good opportunity to finish our talk. Then Dr Disease looked at Dr Killing and started talking to him. Out of interest h-h what is the reason why nobody I know has ever met your friend Dr kill? Nobody you know has met my friend Dr kill because he is a very private man. I have met him. Then Dr Disease looked at the new recruit to the newspaper and started talking to him. What do you mean you have met him? When you lot was in the prison he bumped into me and said he was looking for Dr Killing but he said that he got the wrong day and walked away. Then Dr Killing looked at the new recruit to the newspaper and started talking to him. Yes and like I told you earlier in the day sometimes he gets his days mixed up. Then Dr Disease looked at Dr Killing again and started talking to him again. Okay Dr Killing how long have you been working at Sing Sing prison? I have been working there only recently. Can you go into more detail? Yes I was a Doctor and a surgeon in Germany from 1934 to 1938 and since 1938 I have been an assistant to the state electrician for the State of New York a mixture of Robert G. Elliott and Joseph Francel at Sing Sing prison. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Walter again and started talking to him again. Out of interest young man when was the 1st time you met my daughter? I met her in the end part of 1937. In a flashback it is in the end part of 1937 and Walter is walking down a corridor in the prison and he bumped into somebody. Then Walter started talking to the person. I am sorry about that Miss. That is okay she said looking at him. My name is Walter. And my name is Courtenay. Hello Courtenay. Hello Walter. Then they both kissed. Back in 1940 and we have been in love ever since we met in 1937 and we decided to get married earlier this year. In a flashback it is earlier in the year in august and Walter and Courtenay are having lunch in a restaurant and Walter is wearing a grey suit and Courtenay is wearing her prison guard uniform and at the moment he is talking to her. This is a good dinner he said to do with the matter that they are eating stakes covered in blood. Yes it is Courtenay. He looked round the restaurant that is very big and it filled up with empty tables and empty chairs and that is because the restaurant is completely empty. Then Courtenay looked at Walter and continue talking to him. The Restaurant is empty because my father knows people and he made sure that we was alone and we got 2 blood covered stake each. I love you. And I love you. Then Courtenay lent over and kissed Walter with blood all over her mouth to do with the bloody stakes and the blood from the blood covered stakes got all over her guard uniform as she leant over. Do you know how much I love you? Yes I do and she then lent over and kissed him again and then he continue to eat her stakes. No you don't. I don't understand she said with her mouth full. He pulled out an engagement ring. Then he looked at her and said will you marry me. Then she looked at him and started crying and said yes with her mouth full. Back in 1940 and we have been engaged since then and we probably will be married next year. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Dr Killing again and started talking to him again. Can you tell everyone about your years at medical school? I rather you go in to more detail about your years at medical school. Okay then I will and what would you like to know? Tell us about some memories you had in medical school. Okay I will. In a flashback it is 1919 in a medical school in London and peanut disease is walking down the corridor of the medical school. Then Henry Howard killing walked over and peanut disease started a conversation with him. Hello Henry Howard. Hello peanut how are you? I am fine and how are you? I am fine and what are you doing at the moment? At the moment I am getting ready to go to a class to do with cutting up dead bodies. That is weird because me and my friend are doing the same thing. Your friend who I have never met. Yes my friend Simon kill. Where is your friend at the moment? At the moment he is getting his paperwork to do with the classes together. Okay see you later and peanut disease walked away. After peanut disease walked away Henry Howard killing was standing outside of his class waiting for it to start. The lesson hasn't started yet. Henry Howard killing turnaround and looked at the person who was talking to him and he started talking to him. Not yet which is not a surprise because this teacher is always late and it has always been that way ever since we 1st started this place last year. Yes he is and out of interest he has been working here since 1840 and he has been late every day for the 79 years that he has-been working here. Really he has been late every day for 79 years. Yes and the only reason why they don't make him retire is because he was a great war hero from when he was 20 years old in 1780 to when he started working here in 1840. That is a long time. Yes but if you remember me and you was war heroes as well. Yes we was and out of interest I was talking to my friend who I told you about. The friend who I have never met and do not want to meet. Yes he has another friend. Okay he has another friend. Out of interest I still think it is weird that my friend and his other friend was in the war in Germany as well. What side was they on? They was on the side of England. Then your friend and his friend was not like me and you. What do you mean? I mean your friend and his friend was on the side of England and me and you was on the side of Germany in other words they was on the good side and we was on the bad side. Which was very weird in your case because I was German and that is the reason why I was on the side of Germany but in your case you was English and you was on the side of Germany. Okay this is how it works out I was born in Essex in England in 1900 but my father was born in Germany and my grandfather was born in America and my great-grandfather was born in England. All of my ancestors was German. And to go into more detail because we was on the bad side in a way because when we was on the side it looked like it was the good side instead of the bad side. The side that lost the war in Germany because the war was between England and Germany and England won the war and Germany lost the war. And because we lost the war me and you had to change mind and your names. Yes we did but Germany will rise again. Why would you say that? Because I assume there will be another world war why don't you? I have not giving it much thought but probably there will be another world war and the way it is going Germany will probably lose that world war as well It does seem that way. At the same time as Henry Howard killing and Simon kill are having a conversation in the classroom what peanut disease in it peanut disease is having a conversation with his future wife who are just meeting for the 1st time. Hello my name is peanut disease what is yours? My name is Susan up. Hello Susan are you here to get a medical degree? Yes I am and hopefully I will be a professional surgeon. I am sure you will be. Thank you. You are welcome. You are sweet. Thank you so are you. Back in 1940 and that is how I met my wife in 1919 and then he was married 3 months after and in 1920 the joy of my life was born he said looking at his daughter. Thank you daddy. You are welcome honey. How long was you married? I was married from 1919 to when she died in 1924 at the same time as when I own part of a hospital which I donate money to in the memory of my dead wife because that is what she was of wanted. Walter looked at Dr Disease and started talking to him. I have a question. What is your question? My question is how long are we from the prison? I will ask. Then Dr Disease open the window and put his head through to talk to the driver. A minute later Dr Disease closes the window and sat down again. The driver said we will be there in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later they arrived at the prison and got out and the warden Lewis E. Lawes walked over to the horse and carriage and started talking to Dr Disease. You are late the execution is in 5 minutes so hurry up. And because of that all 7 of them walked to the execution room and got ready for the execution and to go into more detail the warden of sing sing prison Lewis E. Lawes and Dr Disease and Dr Killing and Walter and the new recruit are in the room where the warden watches the execution and Jimmy the guard and Walter's fiancé are watching the execution up close. Dr H.p kill is sitting in the electric chair waiting for the switch to be pulled and for him to be executed. Then Dr H.p kill looked at Courtenay who is looking into his eyes and started talking to her. I am not guilty. Obviously you would say that because you are about to die for been a serial killer. Please I am begging you for my life I did not do it. Again obviously you would say that because you are an evil serial killer who deserves to die and you are trying to get out of it because you think you are not an evil man even though you are an evil man and because you are an evil man you must die and because you are an evil man you will go straight to hell when you get executed which will happen in 5 minutes so in other words you have 5 minutes to live there you will die then you will go to hell where you belong. 5 minutes later the executioner walked over and pulled the switch and after a few minutes Dr H.p kill was dead. After Dr H.p kill was dead Dr Disease is talking to the warden of sing sing prison Lewis E. Lawes. Do you think the execution was good? Yes and it would have been better if you was on time. I was late because New York City is crowded. That sounds right. Do you mean it sounds right because New York City is always crowded? No I mean it sounds right because you are always coming out with excuses and the matter that I know you and I have establish that you are not late because New York is crowded you are late because you probably have a load of people answer pointless questions to do with your game that you do. Okay 2 things Number 1 New York City is crowded because New York City is always crowded and Number 2 when I was waiting in my horse and carriage I did do the option of asking people important questions that everybody wants to know. That sounds correct because if you remember rightly me and you and your friend Dr H.p kill and my friend Ronnie s cold and Dr Killing and Joseph Francel all did 1 of your pointless question things last year. In a flashback it is 1939 somewhere after when Joseph Francel was hired and the warden of sing sing prison Lewis E. Lawes and Dr H.p kill and Ronnie s cold and Dr Killing and Joseph Francel and Dr Disease are all sitting round a table and Dr disease is doing his question thing. Then Dr Disease looked at Ronnie s cold and started talking to him. Can you tell us about the very 1st time you walks into Sing Sing prison when it was 1st built in 1825? Yes I can. In a flashback in a flashback it is 1825 at 9.00 AM somewhere after Sing Sing prison was 1st built but not completely Ronnie s cold is walking from his horse and carriage which is right in front of the prison and walking to the prison and to go into more detail Sing Sing prison is only half-build and because of that matter a number of parts of the half-build Sing Sing prison are covered with people still building the half-build Sing Sing prison. Then the co-warden of the half-build Sing Sing prison Elam Lynds walked up to him and started a conversation. Hello Mr Co-warden of this half-build prison how are you doing today? I am fine Mr War hero and Mr Warden for a different prison and Mr Co-warden of this half build prison how are you doing? I am fine and are you ready to go to work today as the co-warden to a bunch of criminals? Yes I am and are you ready to go to work today as the co-warden to a bunch of criminals? Yes I am. Then both of them walked into the half-build Sing Sing prison. Inside of the half-build Sing Sing prison both of them walked down the half-build corridor of the half-build Sing Sing prison and both of them walked to their giant half-build office what they share. Then both of them walked into their giant half-build office what they share. Inside of their giant half-build office what they share both of them sat down at their desks and both of them started doing paperwork. Later at 11.30 AM 2 unrecognisable guards brought in an unrecognisable prisoner in to the half-build room for the 2 co-warden's to interview for the half-build prison. Both of them looked up from their paperwork and looked at the unrecognisable criminal who the 2 unrecognisable guards brought in and warden Elam Lynds started talking to 1 for the 2 unrecognisable guards. Who is this man major? This man is a coward because he ran away from the front line of the war. What war major said Ronnie s cold. The unrecognisable guard looked at Ronnie s cold and started talking him. The war from 1812 to 1815. Then Elam Lynds looked at the unrecognisable prisoner and started talking him. I was a captain in that war and I do not approve of coward's in the war that I fought in Elam Lynds said in an angry way. Please have mercy. I do not give mercy to cowards especially when they run away from a war that made me famous and a war that I consider the greatest war in the world and that is why I will give you no mercy because you do not deserve it. Please have mercy. Elam Lynds looked at the unrecognisable guard and started talking him. Have this man thrown in the deepest and darkest pit that we have here. Yes sir. Then the 2 unrecognisable guards dragged the unrecognisable prisoner away. Then Elam Lynds looked at Ronnie s cold and started talking him. Sorry about that Ron I have no time for people like him especially because I fought in that war and I had friends die in that war and that is why I punish people who ran away from that war because I fought in that war and I believe that people should not run away from such a good war and that is why I punished that coward for running away from a war that I was in and had a very good time because it was a good war and I will always think that because the war is what made me famous and the war is what made me rich and the war is probably why I got this job here and I always will punish people from running away from the war like that man who was dragged away right then. I completely understand I also had friends die in that war and because of that I do not care about you punishing cowards from that war. That is good to hear because I am planning of having the criminals brought in here and questioned and if they are cowards from any war especially that war I will have the guard execute them in this office on the floor over there near the door. That is a very good idea and out of interest does that include the criminal who just left the room? Yes I will have him bought back in here and question him about his life and then if I established he is a coward he will be thrown on the floor and a guard will shoot him in the head and killed him instantly and then I will be fine with that because he will be dead and that will be 1 more that is dead and because of that it will make the world a better place. Everything you are saying makes perfect sense and everything you just said will happened because the man does deserve to die because he is a coward and cowards deserve to die and that is why the coward will die because he deserves it. And that is why the coward will die later when I questioned him and when I say later I actually mean in about an hour. That is completely a good idea. Yes it is. An hour later at 12.30 PM an unrecognisable guard brought the unrecognisable prisoner back in to the room for the 2 co-warden's to interview the unrecognisable prisoner for his life. Okay I will now interview you about your life and if I am not satisfied with your life I will have a guard execute you on the floor over there near the door. Okay ask your questions. Okay I will and because I do not care about your name when was you born and where did you go into the war you ran away from? I was born on the 14th of July 1789 in Paris in France apparently at the same time as the Storming of the Bastille and I want into the war you are talking about on the 13th of October 1812 to do with the Battle of Queenston Heights. That was a very good story. Then warden Elam Lynds looked at the unrecognisable guard and started talking him. Execute him. Then before the unrecognisable prisoner manage to say anything the unrecognisable guard executed him with a shot to the head. Back in 1939 and that is how my 1st day was like in 1825. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Joseph Francel and started talking him. Out of interest do you remember your last execution? Yes it was only last week. In a flashback in a flashback it is 1939 slightly before the storyline in this scene is based and slightly after when the other flashback showing Joseph Francel's 1st day executing someone in this 1 it is Joseph Francel just executing someone and it is night time and Joseph Francel is about to pull the switch to execute the unrecognisable criminal in the electric chair and as usual the warden of Sing Sing prison Lewis E. Lawes and Dr Killing and Ronnie s cold are standing where the warden stands where the execution takes place and Jimmy the guard and Courtenay Disease are watching the execution up close. Then Joseph Francel pulled the switch and the unrecognisable criminal slowly died from being executed by the electric chair. Back to normal. And that was the execution I did last week. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at the warden of Sing Sing prison Lewis E. Lawes and started talking to him. Out of interest can you tell everybody about and some occasions that you did something especial? Yes I can. In a flashback in a flashback it is the 18th of November 1929 in the office of the warden of Sing Sing prison Lewis E. Lawes he is sitting at his desk thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest today an interview that I did a couple of days ago is in an issue of Time magazine and my face is on the cover of the issue of Time magazine. Then he picked up the issue of Time magazine that he was talking about and put it into a wooden frame and onto a hook on the wall and because of that matter the wooden frame containing the Time magazine that he was talking about is now between a wooden frame containing the piece of paper that contains information about the 1856 mysterious disappearance of a man called Matias Perez that is to the left of it and a wooden frame containing the piece of paper that contains information about the 1872 mysterious disappearance of the crew of the British merchant brigantine Mary Celeste that is to the right of it and a wooden frame containing the piece of paper that contains information about the 1890 mysterious disappearance of the movie director Louis Le Prince that is below it and a wooden frame containing the piece of paper that contains information about the American serial killer H. H. Holmes and the 1893 Chicago World's Fair that is above it. In another flashback in a flashback it is New Year's Day 1930 in the office of the warden of Sing Sing prison Lewis E. Lawes he is sitting at his desk thinking to himself about his situation. Out of interest today is my 10th year as the warden of Sing Sing prison and because of that matter I might as well celebrate by beating up more prisoners like what I have been doing for the last 10 years which obviously has-been my time as the warden of Sing Sing prison. Back in 1939 and both of those occasions was very especial. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Ronnie s cold again and started talking to him again. Out of interest me and everybody else in this room have been to your house and your front room still looks like what it did in the 1790s. That is completely correct. And out of interest can you go into more detail about that? Yes I can and out of interest I have had the house since about the 1790s and because that matter most of the house still looks like what it did in the 1790s. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Dr Killing again and started talking to him again. Out of interest was you a soldier in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 as well. Yes I was but I was in a different part of the particular battle. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Joseph Francel again and started talking to him again. Out of interest can you tell us about your mental Robert Elliott? Yes I can and out of interest my mental Robert Elliott was the state of New York's executioner from 1926 to when he dies earlier this year and now I am the state of New York's executioner and out of interest my mental Robert Elliott executed over 300 people during his 13 years as the state of New York's executioner which includes Bruno Hauptmann on the 3rd of April 1936 and as you all know Bruno Hauptmann was the man who was charged and sentenced for the abduction and murder of the 20-month-old son of the American aviator Charles Lindbergh which is commonly referred to as the Lindbergh kidnapping and out of interest I assisted my mental Robert Elliott with that particular execution. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Ronnie s cold again and started talking to him again. Out of interest was you ever a soldier? I was never a soldier but I was friends with people who did fight in different wars such as the dead 1st warden of Sing Sing prison when it was mostly half built Elam Lynds in the late 1820s and the War of 1812 in the early 1810s and the dead soldier Stonewall Jackson and the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and the American Civil War in the early 1860s which he died in to do with the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863 and the dead 2nd President of Germany and 2nd President of the German Reich Paul von Hindenburg and the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War in the early 1870s and the war in Germany to do with the Eastern Front in the 1910s and the dead soldier Winfield Scott and the War of 1812 in the early 1810s and the Seminole Wars in the early 1800s and the Black Hawk War in 1832 and the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s and the beginning part of the American Civil War in the early 1860s. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at Dr H.p kill and started talking to him. Can you tell everybody about the 1st time you and me 1st met? In what sense do you mean? I mean when we met for the 1st time in the army before we went to the war in Germany in 1914. In a flashback in a flashback it is late 1913 in an American army base a line of soldiers in military uniforms including peanut disease and the future Dr H.p kill and a drill sergeant is talking to them. Listen you bunch of idiots you are joining the army to get ready if there is another war and you lot will be sent there to kill the enemy and win the war and when you are here you will be trained how to kill the enemy and nothing else apart from killing the enemy because nothing else matters apart from killing the enemy because I have been in many wars and I have personally killed thousands of people and where you are here you people will learn how to kill thousands of people and never care about any of them because they are the enemy because the enemy deserves to die because they are the enemy if they did not deserve to die they would not be the enemy they would be your friends but they are not your friends they are the enemy and they deserve to die and you are here to kill the enemy and hopefully you will kill all of the enemy and they will not be any left because killing all the enemies makes sense leaving some survivors does not make sense because why would you do that and when you are here you will be trained how to kill the enemy and how to kill anyone who gets in your way of killing the enemy because killing the enemy is the only thing that matters in in your life because in your life nothing else in your life apart from killing the enemy is okay and tranny for how to kill the enemy will take place later after you lot go to the base and get all your stuff in order because you might die today and you might die on the battlefield trying to kill the enemy but hopefully you will not die before you manage to kill a bunch of the enemy because if you die no 1 will care unless you die heroes and you will die heroes if you kill a bunch of enemies before they kill you and now you are all dismiss. Then the drill sergeant walked away. Later in the base in the place where the soldier sleep peanut disease is getting his bed ready and to go into more detail all the soldiers including peanut disease and the future Dr H.p kill have gotten their uniforms and other equipment and are getting them together on their beds and that is what peanut disease is doing at the moment and at the moment peanut disease is doing that and having a conversation with the boy who sleeping in the bed next to him. Hello my name is peanut disease. Hello peanut my name is Henry Paul but I am usually called H.P. Hello H.P do you like this army place? Yes I do why do you like this army place? Yes I do. Out of interest do you think there will be another war? Hopefully or all of this training will go to waste. Makes sense and obviously we will be taught how to kill the enemy because the drill sergeant did just do a long speech about killing the enemy and out of interest do you think he must really love killing the enemy because of the very big speech he did about killing the enemy? Yes I really do because apparently he has been a soldier since the beginning of the American Civil War on the 21st of July 1861 to do with the 1st Battle of Bull Run and since that day he has never established anything else apart from killing the enemy because killing the enemy is just so great to him and that is why he does long speeches about killing the enemy because he just loves killing the enemy too much which makes sense because apparently killing people is very good and once you start killing people you might never stop killing people because it is just that great. That is completely correct. Back in 1939 and that was me and you meeting for the 1st time in 1913. That is good. Then Dr Disease looked at the warden of Sing Sing prison Lewis E. Lawes and started talking to him. Out of interest can you tell everybody about if you met the evil serial killer and cannibal Albert Fish when he was arrested in March 1935? Yes I 1st met him in March 1935 because I interviewed him when he was 1st sent to Sing Sing prison. In a flashback in a flashback it is March 1935 at 12.20 AM Warden Lawes is sitting at a table that prisoners usually eat there dinner at and he is eating dinner in the empty canteen what is completely empty apart from him and 2 guards who are guarding him when he is eating. Then a guard pushed a prisoner on the floor of the empty canteen and to go into more detail the prisoner is a little old man who is very creepy looking wearing a prisoner uniform. Then Warden Lawes looked at him and said what is your name prisoner? Then the prisoner looked at Warden Lawes and started talking to him. My name is Albert Fish sir. How long have you been in Sing Sing prison prisoner? I have been in Sing Sing prison since today sir. What was your crime prisoner? Murder and rape and cannibalism sir. What was the details of the murder and rape and cannibalism prisoner? Since 1924 I have been a serial killer of children sir. So you are saying you are a chid murderer prisoner. Yes sir. Then Warden Lawes clapped his hand and 1 of the guards punched Albert Fish in the face. Then the guards punched Albert Fish in the face over and over again. Out of interest that is how we treat child murderers in Sing Sing prison prisoner. Then Warden Lawes looked at the guards and started talking to them. Throw the prisoner back in to his prison cell and make sure he stays there for the rest of the month and make sure he only gets half rations. Then the guards dragged Albert Fish away. After the guards dragged Albert Fish away the warden said I love my job and then continue eating his dinner. Back in 1939 and that was when I met the evil serial killer and cannibal Albert Fish in March 1935. Back in 1940 and that was some of the pointless questions that you asked. Then Warden Lewis E. Lawes walked away. Later after all the criminals was in their cells in the canteen there is a party with the warden Lewis E. Lawes and Dr killing and Ronnie s cold and the executioners Joseph Francel and Walter and Jimmy the guard and Walter's fiancé and Dr Disease and the new recruit to the newspaper and the new boss to the newspaper and the old boss to the newspaper are all there partying and getting drunk. End of chapter 12[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 the next day The next day which is obviously now Halloween 1940 at 11.55 AM at the newspaper Walter is walking into work late because he is hung over from the execution party the night before. Then his new boss walked up to him also hung over also from the execution party the night before and started talking to him. Are you just coming in now Walter? Yes especially after the execution party we had last night. Yes but we must start today to do with the execution yesterday. Yes. Out of interest where is the new recruit? He is sleeping in the back of my car. How long has he been there? Since last night. Well tell him when you wake him up to go home and get sober and come into work tomorrow. I will. Out of interest what are you doing today apart from the stuff to do with the execution yesterday? Today I must interview the families of the victims who Dr H.p kill murdered. Yes you should. Then Walter walked out of the room. Outside of the room Walter walked out of the newspaper. Outside of the newspaper Walter walked to his car and got in. Inside of his car Walter looked in the back of the car when the new recruit to the newspaper is asleep. In a dream sequence it is Halloween 1970 slightly before 12.00 PM so in other words the same day and about the same time 30 years in the future in the newspaper place the future version of the new recruit to the newspaper who at the moment is a professional reporter is sitting at his desk writing down information about himself. Out of interest this century has-been going for over 70 years but I have only been alive for over 46 of those over 70 years and out of interest it has been a very weird century because of the weird things have happened in this century such as 3 world wars in the 1910s and 1940s and the 1960s and to go into more detail the 3 world wars went from 1914 to 1918 and 1939 to 1945 and the beginning part of 1966 which is still going and out of interest all 3 World wars have taken place in Germany and have had a gap of 21 years between each of them to do with the matter that from the end of what some people called World War I in 1918 to the beginning of what some people called World War II in 1939 is a gap of 21 years and from the end of what some people called World War II in 1945 to the beginning of what some people called World War III in 1966 is a gap of 21 years and out of interest what some people called World War I went on for 4 years from 1914 to 1918 and what some people called World War II went on for 6 years from 1939 to 1945 so by those particular rules what some people called World War III Bill and will end after 8 years 1974 and what will be called World War IIII will begin in the year 1995 25 years from now where I will be still alive probably and to go into more detail about that at the moment I am over 46-years-old and 25 years from now in the year 1995 I will be over 71-years-old and out of interest I am happy I am a reporter and never have been a soldier especially not during the lifetime of my long deceased father and the matter that he was a soldier in the 1st 2 World wars in the 1910s and the 1940s and a revolution in Mexico in the 1910s and he got a bunch of awards for fighting and a bunch of very high up ranks in the Army and having to be like a long list of long dead people but now no more talk about my long deceased father. Then the new recruit woke up from Walter saying to him wake up you lazy bum. Then the new recruit looked at Walter and started talking to him. How long have I been asleep here? All night since yesterday when you got drunk and left the part and got into my car and fell asleep. In a flashback it is the night before and the new recruit is walked out of sing sing prison. Then the new recruit started walking across the place where the cars and also the horse and carriage are place when they are not being used because the new recruit is walking to Walter's car which is taking him a long time because he is drunk. A few minutes later the new recruit is now standing next to Walter's car and he is trying to get into the car. A few minutes later the new recruit managed to open the boot of Walter's car. Then the new recruit got into Walter's car and went to sleep to do with the matter that he is drunk. Back to normal. Okay that is how I got into this car. Yes it is. Out of interest what time is it? It is slightly before 12.00 PM. Out of interest what are you going to do today? I am going to interview the families of the victims who Dr H.p kill murdered. Out of interest can I come with you when you interview the families of the victims who Dr H.p kill murdered? No you cannot. Why not? This is what is going to happen I am going to interview the families of the victims who Dr H.p kill murdered and you are going home and getting sober. Okay then. Then the new recruit got out of the car and walked away and Walter drove away.

Note To Readers: I am aware of any minor grammatical errors in which you may see. ___________________ Willard's Evasion of His Confinement \"Chapter One - Dreams & Needles\" Willard lay there, still. Socrates burrowed down his sleeve. This is the second week of his constrainment. Never speaking. Never eating. Never moving when others are around. He lay there curled on his decrepit old hospital bed staring in a reverie at the wall. He dreamed of a world which excludes people and all their cruel ways. A world where he is free with only himself and Socrates. He hated everyone. Everyone but Socrates. He didn't need them. They took everything from him. He knew Socrates would come back to him. They will never find out. He will never let harm come to Socrates ever again. This dream of world excluding all people keeps him going but what continues his depression is the fact that his dreams are only a fools paradise. Never to come true. He is still alone with only one hope of escape. Socrates. The door which keeps him imprisoned from the outside hall squeaked and a woman walked inside. \"It's time to change your bandages Mr. Stiles,\" a female nurse with brown hair and crooked teeth told Willard. He ignored her and continued to delve deeper into his reverie, staring at the wall. The closer the nurse came to him the closer he curled his body into a ball. With his knees held to his chest he continued his silence. Unwilling to cooperate with the nurse Willard stayed still with his back turned towards her. She rolled his dark blue uniform shirt up his back. This action reveals large black and blue bruises and hundreds of unhealed scratches. Two weeks he's been in physical pain with his scars and bruises, never showing any sign of healing. Willard, uncaring about his physical health, continued delving into his illusion. \"Why aren't these healing?\" the nurse tells herself while removing the old and worn bandages from his back and replacing them with fresh ones. Having finished replacing Willard's bandages the nurse softly rolled his shirt back down. \"Poor guy,\" the nurse whispered to herself as she picked up the old bandages and walks out the door locking it behind her. He lay there for hours on his bed still curled in his little comforting ball with Socrates burrowed up his sleeve. Willard was waiting. Waiting for someone else to enter the room and bother him once more. None came. Knowing there be nothing and no one to hinder him in his reverie he slowly uncurled himself and sat upon his bed. He whispered, \"Socrates.\" and a little white rat with pink ears and red eyes crawled out from his sleeve into his hands. The next few hours he sat there holding Socrates in his hands staring at the wall that stood in front of him continuing his reverie with a delirious smile upon his face. His smile faded once the cell door opened. Socrates crawled back up Willard's sleeve. It was his doctor. He didn't know her name for he refused to listen to the words that any person spoke to him. Willard stayed still once more. Never moving his eyes from the wall which helped him in staying locked in his dream. \"It's time we try something,\" she says allowed while rolling a tray which carried needles filled with green solution into the room. Unconcerned with what was about to occur, as long as he was still able to be left alone to continue in his fools paradise, Willard sat there. The doctor pulled out a small light and shown it in Willard's eyes. \"Your still not there,\" the doctor told herself. Willard doesn't flinch. The doctor pulled the tray holding the needles closer to the bed. \"This won't hurt a bit,\" the doctor tells Willard despite the fact he will not answer. She began to roll his sleeve up but notices something moving about. The doctor jumped and Socrates runs out from inside his sleeve and under the hospital bed. Willard grabbed the doctor's arm, which was holding the needle containing the green liquid, and attempted to keep her from stabbing his arm. Lethargic from lack of nutriment, he failed his attempt and the doctor now had his arm locked down with hers. Having possessed control of him, the doctor succeeded in puncturing his veins and releasing the green liquid into his blood stream. The doctor stood back and watched as Willard's eyes began to close and his body fell sideways upon his bed. She walked towards him and grabbed his legs laying him fully onto the bed. \"See you in the morning Mr. Stiles,\" she told his unconcious self. Socrates ran out from his hiding place under Willard's bed out the cell door. \"We need to get some mouse traps!\" the doctor yelled as she closed the thick metal door locking him in the cell once more. He was unconscious and alone with not even Socrates to greet him when he awakes.[Chapter 2] \"Chapter Two - Carvings\" It felt like eternity since he had awaken. His arms were numb and his eyes refused to open. Forcing his heavy eyelids to lift, he felt a woman's hand move across his face. He knew it was a woman's hand for her finger nails slid softly against his skin. The woman placed her hands upon his eyelids and she opened them herself, shining a bright light in front of his eyes. He blinked his eyes. \"Your there,\" the woman said with a smile on her face. Willard just lay there. Confused. What had happend? Where was Socrates? \"Do you remember who I am?\" she smiled, \"I'm Dr. Long. Can you stand up?\" the doctor asked him. He opened his mouth beginning to say something but he was speechless and continued his silence. Willard stared at the doctor with an astute vision. All that had happend the day before was all a haze. The only thing on his mind was the whereabouts of Socrates. Willard attempted to stand up. His weak and lethargic limbs compelled his goal of standing. Dr. Long grabbed his arms and helped him stand. Once he had a good grasp of the doctor, he was on his feet. \"I think it's about time you went for a walk. We'll go to the cafeteria. I'm sure your hungry,\" she smiled and directed Willard towards the door. He became excited at the thought of entering a place outside of his cell. A place which he has been locked in for over two weeks. Above all he hoped to find Socrates. Once Willard and the doctor had made it to the door, his eyes strained at the light staring down at him from the fluorescent lights hanging above. He covered his eyes with his free hand. The doctor continued holding his other arm which was helping him stand. \"You'll get used to it,\" she told him. They made there way down the labyrinth of hallways. People stared and commented at the sight of his pale face and bloodshot eyes. \"Hey, rat boy's out of his room!\" a nurse with short brown hair wearing a blue nurse outfit yelled from another patient's room; where he was putting bandages on someone's injured leg. He couldn't think. He wanted revenge but couldn't bring himself to think. His own way of thought seemed to be controlled by the drugs. Standing there he looked back at the nurse. He was confused. \"Come on Mr. Stiles. We're almost to the cafeteria,\" his doctor pulled on his arm. He followed his doctors lead. Willard and his doctor had entered the cafeteria. Only a few people were present. Three patients, two cooks, and five doctors. Dr. Long sat him in a chair at a table sitting alone in a dark corner of the room. \"You stay here while I get you a tray,\" she walked away, leaving him alone. Carvings were in various places on the wall where he was sitting. There were scratches of animals, houses, initials of people who have come and gone from the hospital. What caught his eye was the carving of three mice. They appeared to be standing in a row. Large X's were carved in the places their eyes should have been. He raised his hand and slid his fingers over the curves of the carving. He whispered,\"Socrates...\" He jumped when his doctor had touched him on his shoulder. \"Mr. Stiles, here's your food,\" sher placed the tray on the metal table in front of him. Unable to resist it, he grabbed his metal spoon and began to devour the food. The doctor sat down in the next chair and watched as he fulfilled his hunger. \"Take it easy Mr. Stiles. You'll get a stomach ache like that,\" she said matte-of-factly. Willard slowed down and decided to stare at the carving on the wall. \"I see your looking at the carvings. Some patients like to use the ends of their spoons to force imprints on the walls. It's a way of leaving their mark on the hospital. To let future patients know who has came and went from this place,\" she told him. He looked down at his spoon and noticed that the end had been filed down to the nub. \"Don't get any ideas though. This is hospital property. I don't want to catch you carving on the walls now. I'm sure you can find another way of leaving your mark on this place one day Mr. Stiles. Not today though,\" Dr. Long said playfully. He looked at the carving once more then back at the doctor who was staring at something moving about in the hall. \"I'll be right back Mr. Stiles,\" his doctor ran out into the hall. \"It's that white rat again. Clever little devil isn't it?\" Willard could hear Dr. Long talking from inside the cafeteria. Socrates ran into the cafeteria towards his table with Willard's doctor running far behind. She turned around to lecture the other hospital emplyees. \"Go on. Don't just stand there. Help me catch it.\" While she was turned away Willard grasped Socrates in his hand and let him crawl up his sleeve out of sight. The doctor turned around and noticed the little white rat was gone. \"Did you see where it went?\" she asked him. \"Oh nevermind. Lets get you back to your room,\" she grabbed his arm and they walked back to his room. He stared back at the carving on the wall. She kept pulling on his arm, forcing him to walk with her. On there way back to his cell he confronted the nurse once again. \"Awww, rat boy has to go back to his room,\" the nurse satirized. \"Oh, leave him alone. This has been a big day for Mr. Stiles. He needs his rest now,\" his doctor scolded the nurse and looked at Willard, \"That's just Jim, he's a jokester.\" They reached his cell and Willard walked inside. He was confused of what had just happened. Dr. Long, still holding his arm, helped him sit down upon his bed. Looking up at his doctor he began to say something. He couldn't bring himself to express any words. He raised his hand towards her. \"I...I..\" he tried again. \"I'll be back tomorrow,\" his doctor walked out the cell door, locking it behind her. Four hours had past and Willard could feel the drug, that had been controlling his way of thought all day, fading. His own thoughts that had been blocked by the drug's affects were slowly coming back to him. He recollected the events of the day. Socrates disappearing, the nurse taunting him, the carvings on the walls. He pulled out Socrates from up his sleeve and held him is his hands. A deviant look formed on his face. \"Let's leave our mark,\" Willard stared Socrates in the eyes.[Chapter 3] \"Chapter Three - Blood & Flashbacks\" The next morning Willard awoke with a sharp pain shooting through his head. It felt like thousands of needles were being compressed all throughout his brain. He could feel the scratches and bruises all over his body ten times worse than before. He heard a squeak at the door. Socrates ran into a small crevice of his sheet and Dr. Long walked in. She saw Willard squinting his eyes trying to look at her but the pain was too excruciating. \"You must be feeling the side effects. It's time for another dosage,\" his doctor rolled in the tray with the syringe's filled with green liquid. Willard moved his head from side to side beckoning her not to inject him with that drug again. He rolled over on his side with his back facing her and he curled into his comforting little ball. She stared at him with pity. \"Oh, alright. I guess we can see how you do today without the drug. I'll be back in a few hours to see how your doing,\" his doctor rolled the tray out the door and she left. He lay there staring at the wall with Socrates burrowed in a small hole of his pillow. The sharp pain in his head slowly disappeared and he was able to open his eyes. He pulled Socrates out from his little niche in the pillow and held him in his hands. \"Tear it up,\" willard placed the edge of the pillow up to Socrates' mouth. Socrates began to rip and tear the edge of the pillow with his sharp little teeth. The little white rat seemed to get carried away. Willard's hand was still holding the edge of the pillow and Socrates inadvertently bit his pointer finger leaving a small bite mark the size of a quarter. Willard pulled his hand away and impulsively placed his finger in his mouth and began to suck on the small trickles of blood which dripped from the wound. The blood touched his tongue leaving a bitter but sweet taste in his mouth. Willard stared at Socrates with a deranged smile. A small blood stain formed on the white sheets. The door opened and Dr. Long walked in. Socrates ran back into the little hole in his pillow. \"Do you think you can go for a walk today Mr. Stiles?\" she asked. Willard stared blankly at the doctor. She glanced at his bed and noticed the small blood stain. \"What happened?\" Dr. Long said in a concerned way. She grabbed Willard's arm and pulled him off his bed. He walked back into the corner of his room with a panicked look on his face. She glanced over the bed linens and walked towards him in the corner. Grabbing his arm they both walked out the door. \"We need linen change in room 3-911,\" his doctor told a nurse holding an old woman's hand who was sitting in a hospital wheelchair. The nurse left the old woman's side. \"Where are you going?\" the senile woman shreaked. Willard stood there watching as the old woman continued to scream and spit up revolting mucus. She rocked back and forth, holding her arms in a cross. He imagined the old woman in the image of his own mother. This abhorrent flashback upset him. Unable to handle the strain of the woman's screams he held his hands up to his ears trying to drown out the blood curdling sound. He pulled on the ends of his black hair. In the back of his head he could hear his mother's voice. \"Clark!\" she would yell. \"You hate me!\" Still holding his head he told the voice,\"N...no mother. I..I love you.\" Dr. Long watched him in his delirium and noticed the blood from his finger smear on his hair and face. She grabbed his arm and took hold of his hand. Holding his hand in hers she pulled out some bandages from her pocket and began to wrap one around his wound. \"How could that have happend,\" she asked herself. She pulled on his arm trying to make him move further from the old woman's shrieks. He was afraid to move. His muscles tightened in his legs. He seemed to be in his own lurid world. Dr. Long, unknowing what was going through Willard's head, continued to try and make him move. He still refused to budge. The old woman continued to scream. The doctor ran off somewhere around the corner and a few seconds later she returned with a syringe filled with the green liquid in her hands. Tapping it with her finger she ran towards Willard and punctured his arm with the needle. His hands fell from his head and everything around him turned into a haze. Everything began to spin. His legs went limp. He lost his balance and fell backwards hitting the cold hospital floor.[Chapter 4] \"Chapter Four - Aphotic Room\" It was dark. It was cold. It was damp. It was an unknown place where he feared the worse. Different from his other room. Where was he? Silence began to overtake him. No Socrates. No dreams. No...nothing. He lay propped up against a corner of the cold cement room. He lifted his hand up against the wall. Feeling the dampness, he slid it down towards the floor. Still he felt nothing but the dark. He yearned for even the slightest sliver of light to be seen. Still none could be found. For hours this continued. Silent, with only the dark dampness of the room to keep him company. Without warning, a large beam of light overtook the cave-like atmosphere. He covered his eyes with his hands. The brightness of the light made him feel as though it would make him go blind. He moved his feet trying to back away. The darkness had kept him too long. A shadow covered the light from entering the room just as it had opened. He lowered his hands from his face and tried to look up at who had entered. This person was holding something. Something box-shaped. He could hear a small squeak and scratching coming from inside the box shaped shadow. The shadowed person moved away from the door. He heard a loud click. He covered his ears and closed his eyes from the effect of the sound. It felt so loud against his ear drums. So many hours in silent darkness enhanced his senses a great deal. As he opened his eyes to the fluorescence of the light shining above him, it caused him to cover his eyes once more. \"Mr. Stiles,\" he heard a voice say. \"Open your eyes,\" he listened to the voice once more and knew it was his Dr. Long. He lifted his hand from his eyes and tried to adjust to the sudden change in surrounding. The walls were a blinding white. What had felt like cement was actually rugged tiles. What he saw before him caused him to squirm. On the floor in front of him, locked in a cage, was Socrates. He began to crawl up to the cage with all the strength he had. He almost made it till his doctor walked and stood right in front of the cage. Keeping him from Socrates. Willard backed away. He looked up at his doctor in dismay. \"We found this little rodent hiding in your pillow,\" Dr. Long stared at him. Willard stared back. He began to open his mouth. He tried to say something but nothing would come out. The nervousness was just too much. She walked sideways away from the cage. Willard looked from the cage back to his doctor. \"Go ahead. I know he's yours,\" she told him. He crawled closer to the cage and lifted the opening. After grabbing Socrates he slid himself back into his corner and held the little white rat in his hands up against his face. \"Socrates\" Willard whispered only loud enough so as Socrates could hear him. His doctor stood there and observed Willard's every move. How he held the little rat cupped between both his hands. How he caressed it's soft white fur. He sat there holding Socrates in an embrace for the longest time while the doctor watched. While lost in his ambience, his doctor walked up to him and knelt down. Knowing he wasn't paying any attention to her she pulled out a syringe filled with red liquid. She held it up in front of his face. He looked up. He slowly lowered Socrates. The little white rat crawled up his sleeve in hiding. He snapped out of his daze and stared panic stricken at the sight before him. \"This is why you are in this place Mr. Stiles. Now, this will be the last time you will see your little friend here. I promise we will find a nice home for him…\" her sentence was cut off when Jim, the nurse who had cruelly bantered Willard in the past, walked by the cell door and glanced inside. \"There you are. I brought the straitjacket you asked for,\" he continued his way into the room, \"...Oh! Rat boy must be in some big kind of trouble if you're giving him that,\" Jim looked down at the doctor who was holding the syringe with red liquid up to Willard's face threateningly. The doctor looked up at the nurse and sneered. \"That will be quite enough. Just set it down over there by the door. We aren't quite sure whether we will be using it yet,\" his doctor snapped at the nurse. The nurse did as she said and left the room mumbling words of blasphemy under his breath. \"Now...\" his doctor looked back down at him. He was holding onto the walls behind him. Thoughts were running through his head. What was about to happen? Where would she take Socrates? He tried searching for anything to advocate his situation. No words came to him. She slowly lifted his arm and reached for Socrates. Pulling him out, the little white rat screeched. Socrates tried to break free but she kept a strong grip of him. Willard watched as she stuck the needle into Socrates' back. The little rat's wails filled the cold white room. They seemed to echo. It was an eerie sound. \"Nooo!\" Willard cried and reached for Dr. Long.[Chapter 5] \"Chapter Five - The Call Of Socrates\" What had happend the day before he could not bare to think about. It was so awful. Deplorable. Guilt overcame him. He remembered what he had done to all of them. How he charred their small bodies after the murderous act he committed. The screams. The deathly screams. Despite his grief once again over Socrates, he tried to think. Think of a way to get him back. What could he do? She had taken him. Socrates being held by her. Oh the screams that the little white rat screamed. How could he be so blind? He thought the needle was meant for him......not Socrates. Why Socrates? He never did anything to her for such an act to be done towards him. The only friend he had. Subconsciously he knew...he would somehow...come back to him. As Willard stay locked in his room, Socrates was waking out of his own affliction. The bars that surrounded him were nothing. With all the strength he had he rised out of his haze and placed his little teeth to the bars. He could not succeed. He was too weak. The bar's were too thick. He began to squeal. Loud. Very loud. All of his kind in the large hospital was once awaken by the screams of little Socrates. All of his kind crawled out of their own hiding places and followed the sound. This wailing lasted for hours. The rats were coming. Slowly but surely they all heard his affliction. They were coming at last. The rats were coming. The hospital's staff could not hear as well the little rat's screams as Willard could. This excited him a great deal. He knew that Socrates was still alive. He guided his way through the aphotic room. The grooves of the tiles led him towards the door of his cold damp cell. Once he felt the indentation of the door he stopped. With both his hands somewhat glued to the door he placed his ears somewhat in the middle of the door. He could hear more clearly Socrates in his anguish. He could hear the many scratches of small feet running through the walls. He knew they were running for Socrates. Exultant. That was how Willard felt at that moment. A smile overcame his face. He knew the rats were coming. The rats were coming... He stayed sitting at the cell door's feet for the longest time. Listening for more. More....he didn't know exactly. Maybe....hoping the rats will somehow help Socrates. He knew they would. Tears ran down his face. Still smiling he seemed to drown in his own grief. \"Socrates...\" he screeched hoping that in some way the little rat could hear him. To let him know that he still cared for him. Footsteps could be heard coming nearer to the door. Willard payed no attention. He continued to listen for the rats. The locks were being removed from the door and the door was pushed open. Knocking him furthur into the room. He held himself up with both his hands. They clicked the light on and he covered his eyes from the sudden luminescence of the fluorescent light encaged in wire hanging from the ceiling. Who entered the door was Dr. Long. Two large men in blue nurses attire stood behind her with looks of enjoyment on their faces. As though they were hoping he would attempt something. The doctor held the straitjacket that the patronizing nurse had placed in the room the day before. \"Your coming with us Mr. Stiles,\" she said sharply and motioned her hand in such a way the two nurses did as was she was implying. He backed away toward his corner of the room. He covered his head trying to shield himself from the two large men. They grabbed his arms and forcefully placed the straitjacket on him. He tried to break free but was then pushed towards the door. He could still hear the rats. He could still hear Socrates' cry. Once he was standing near the exit of his cell he saw a large brown rat scurry down the hall. He knew it was running towards whereever Socrates was being held. Willard smirked.[Chapter 6] \"Chapter Six - Torment & Murder\" He staggered down the catacomb-like hallways. The two nurses kept a strong grasp on the straps of the straitjacket. They made their way towards a large room. A large metal structure stood thus in the middle of the room. Only one word could come to Willard's mind. Torture. \"This technique is used for all formidable patients,\" Dr. Long smirked and continued, \"What you did yesterday was awful.\" He lay on the thick steel bed. No sheets nor pillow to lay his head. It was cold. \"This should make your mind right,\" she undid the straitjacket. His legs were strapped tightly to the cold metal bed. \"After this you will never think of striking another person again. All for that rat. I really should...\" she stopped talking and looked up. Who should walk in the room but that patronizing nurse, Jim. \"I heard what you were about to do from the staff. This proceeder hasn't been done in decades. I wanted to watch,\" Jim smiled at the doctor and sat in a metal chair near the door. He was locked tightly to the metal structure with thick leather straps. A tray holding syringes filled with different coloured liquids stood beside her. She held with one hand his right arm while grasping a syringe filled with black liquid with the other. Stabbing his arm with the syringe he closed his eyes. It stung. He could feel his whole body turning cold. Feeling the drug racing through his blood stream, he screamed. A paroxysm of shaking overtook his body as she stuck him with yet another needle. This time the color of liquid contained in the syringe was translucent. Tears ran down his face as he screamed in torment. After injecting him with the strange coloured liquids she stood back and watched as the drugs took hold of him. Dr. Long stared in satisfaction the torture Willard was experiencing. A whole hour past and the affects faded. He stopped shaking and he lay there still awake. His eyes stayed closed for he was unable to lift them. He was so tired he could not move a muscle. \"That was great,\" the nurse sitting in the chair stood up and clapped. This made the doctor smile and thank the nurse. \"If you wouldn't mind go get that rat friend of his. I'm sure you know where it's being kept. I have a few things to do, so take it to my office next week.\" she told the Jim. He looked at her in dismay. \"What do you want it for?\" he asked. \"I want to examine it. I want to know why it seems to communicate with him so well,\" she glanced over at the limp and slightly twitching Willard. The nurse nodded and left the room. \"You two take him back to room 3-911,\" she told the two large nurses who were standing by as if they were gaurding the room. The two large nurses walked over to Willard and unstrapped his limp body from the metal structure. They grabbed his arms and began to drag him out of the room with his two feet sliding against the cold floor. Making their way back down the catacomb like hallways they made their way back to the main floor of the hospital where his original room was waiting. Although he could not open his eyes or move any part of his limp body he heard the nurses talking. \"What do you think of this guy?\" he heard the nurse holding his left arm say. The nurse holding his arm on the right replied. \"I always thought the guy looked sad. What did he do in the first place to have to go through that? Man, I tell ya. I didn't even know they still did that treatment here. I thought this place was up to date.\" the nurse on the right shook his head. \"You were there. Don't you remember?\" the nurse on the left said. \"Yeah, I do. But he didn't do anything. She enticed him. I think she gets a joy out of it. He didn't even grab her that hard. He only wanted her to give back that rat thing of his which she gave to him then decided to take it back.\" the right nurse replied. \"I think we should turn her in. That was ultimately cruel what she did to the poor guy.\" the left nurse said while they made their way up some long dark stairs to the main floor. \"What? And get fired? No, lets just let it be. I've had a hard enough time getting this job.\" the right nurse sighed. \"I guess your right. Maybe the guy will fight back somehow. If he does. I don't want to be around when he does.\" the left nurse said sadly. The two finally made it to room 3-911 and placed Willard's limp body on his bed and locked the door behind them. Thoughts ran through his head while lying there on his soft but decrepit hospital bed. Thoughts of revenge. Thoughts of escape. Thoughts...that meant something deadly. Meanwhile Jim had made his way to the room in which Socrates was being held. He could hear little scratches coming from within the room. Every once in awhile he would hear a squeal. He thought it was only the little white rat so he opened the door. He spotted the cage and made his way towards it. The door suddenly shut as if by itself. He looked back and noticed a pile of rats had somehow closed the door with impact. A look of panic overtook his face. All of the rats little beady eyes stared all around him. They were everywhere around the room. The nurse and the rats stared back at each other for only a few seconds which seemed like an hour till one rat decided to attack. It jumped on the nurses neck and bit a large chunk of skin from his now bleeding neck. The rest of the rats followed this rats lead. He screamed in anguish. Blood splat around the room. Losing too much blood made him fall backward onto the floor. With his eyes still wide open he took his last breath. Blood poured from his mouth. Jim was dead. The rats dispersed and an eerie silence overtook the room and labyrinth of empty hallways surrounding it.[Chapter 7] \"Chapter 7 - Evasion\" Days went by with no sign of Jim. It was the end of the day and everyone had gone home. All the patients were locked away safely in their rooms. Dr. Long began to worry about the whereabouts of the nurse. She was worried that the nurse had taken the rat himself for reason's she didn't know. Deciding to look for herself, whether the rat was gone, she found the keys to the room which Socrates was hopefully, to her, still being kept. To allure the rat, incase it had escaped, she decided to fetch some food for it. Walking down the labyrinth of hallways she could faintly smell something nauseating in the air. She knew this smell too well. As a doctor she has experienced many deaths and their after affects. Before going any further she called security at a nearby phone. Once three men baring name tags and security outits had arrived they all covered their faces. \"Gah, what is that?\" one of the men with a name tag which read 'Gary' commented. \"It's the smell of a decomposing body. I suggest you go check it out,\" Dr. Long handed the head of security the keys. They all walked further down the hallway. The nauseating smell became stronger. The head of security, who's name tag read Roy, unlocked the door and slowly opened it revealing a sight too aweful to describe. Dried blood staind the floor of the room. Laying in the middle of the room was the nurse. His body had slowly been rotting. His chest had sunken. The skin on his body looked damp with a detestable smell emanating from the putrescent corpse. It was an eerie sight to witness. Unwary the condition of the dead nurse, Dr. Long began to search the cage for Socrates. She pulled some cheese out of her pocket and slowly walked closer to the cage. The door which locked the cage had been bent open. Little Socrates was gone. She turned around and looked at the people of security. \"Follow me,\" she continued \"I know who did this.\" They looked at her in confusion. \"Well, what about him?\" Roy asked her. \"I'll have the staff take care of it,\" she said as she walked back through the hallway. \"I'll call the police,\" the third security man ran down a different direction through the labyrinth of hallways. They had finally made their way to room 3-911 where Willard, it seems, had been quite busy for the past few days. His muscles still ached from the torture he endured a few days ago. \"Do you hear that?\" Gary said suprisingly. The doctor almost tripped as a small rat ran through the little slit at the bottom of the door. \"Open the door already,\" impatiently, Dr. Long handed Roy the key. Hesitantly he unlocked the door. Willard stood in a corner of the room looking down at the little white rat laying as if it were sleeping in the palm of his hands. It's little body moved as it respired slow breaths. Willard held him while slightly shaking. His long black hair covered his eyes. He gave a sharp look at the doctor. They stared in amazement at the rat infested room. \"Look at all the rats!\" Roy yelled. Willard looked up with an angry deranged expression on his face and replied with great solemnity, \"Yes...look...at the rats.\" A great many rats had ran out the room running between Dr. Long, Roy, and Gary's feet. They all backed away from the cell door. \"I'm getting out of here,\" the Roy said panicking. He slowly moved away from the door and began to somewhat jog down the hospital hallways towards the entrance of the insitution. \"Just lock them in!\" the doctor yelled after them. She panicked and left the door open. She ran after the security men. Willard slowly walked out of his now unlocked door, still holding the small white rat in his hands. The countless rats followed behind him. He walked towards the main hall. Dr. Long, Roy, and Gary had almost made it to the main exit when Willard arrived. They stopped and Dr. Long began to talk. \"Mr. Stiles, just stay where you are,\" she said slowly. Gary slowly pulled out his gun and pointed it at Willard. \"Son, listen to what she's telling you. Don't move...\" He continued to walk closer towards them with the rats still following close behind. His eyes turned glassy. You could almost feel the anger when looking into his eyes. \"You... Hurt... Socrates!\" he said vehemently, sharply pointing to the doctor. Walking closer towards them they panicked. He had a slightly satisfied expression on his face. Delirious. Shaking uncontrollably, Gary shot a round off. It ricocheted off the wall hitting Willard's arm then killing a random rat running behind him. The bullet teared his uniform sleeve where blood was slowly being absorbed by the fabric. This didn't seem to phase him. With the main door too far for them to reach in time they ran into an emty room and closed the door hoping to find refuge from the innumerable rats. He layed Socrates on a table and grabbed the keys which number matched the room they had run into. After trapping the doctor and security men in the small cell room he threw the key in a nearby trash can. He picked Socrates back up and began to walk towards the main door of the hospital. Before exiting, he noticed the door which they kept patients belongings was standing open. He knew he coudn't leave in just his hospital uniform so he looked around to make sure no one was coming and he ran into the room. The countless rats followed and gathered in the room with him. Laying Socrates down on a table in the middle of the room, he looked around. Countless little boxes with names of patients filled the tall shelves of the room. The first box he noticed was his own which said in black typed ink \"Stiles, Willard\". Slowly he slid the box out of the shelf and placed it on the table next to Socrates. He sat in a chair which had been slid under the table. Opening the box revealed his father's red pocket knife. It was darkly crusted with Ben's blood. Slowly he slid the knife open. Tears ran down his cheek at the memory of what he did. He had to do it. He had to show Ben who was boss. At the sight of the knife he became angry...but satisfied. Placing the knife down beside Socrates' small body he looked once more into the box. His black leather wallet layed in a corner. It too was covered in dried blood. A small smile formed on his face and he opened the wallet. His license and two five dollar bills were left in the wallet's billfold. He stood back up and placed the wallet next to the knife. Looking around once more he noticed an old man's overcoat. On the inside neck of the coat was the name 'Jeffery'. It was black and slightly worn. Reminding him of his dead father's clothing he picked it up and slid his arms through the sleeves. It was a perfect fit. He slightly smirked. Just under where the over coat was hanging were a pair of shiny black men's dress shoes. A few rats had burrowed in the the heels of the shoes. He removed his hospital slippers, sharply whispered \"Out\" to the rats and they both jumped out of the shoes and he slid them on. He picked Socrates back up and held him to his face as if to hug him. \"Socrates...we're almost out...let's leave this place Socrates...\" he said slowly to the little white rat with a small smile. He placed his blood crusted wallet and pocket knife into his overcoat's pockets. Walking towards the door, he opened it. A cold breeze blew against his face. The hundreds of rats still followed. Looking back at the swarm of rats a look of melancholic dread formed on his face. \"I...I can't take you with me. I'm sorry. You have a home here.\" This made the lot of them angry. Taking a small glance at the registration table he saw a large rat. It looked somewhat like ben. Looking into its angry small black beady eyes he gasped. The large rat had a look of revenge. \"Ben!\" he hesitated to say, \"I...I killed you.\" he said in a panic. He hurried and ran out the door, tightly closing it behind him. Placing his ear to the door he could hear them dispersing. Sliding his arm against the door breathing heavily, his blood smeared on the door's surface. Where the rats were going, he didn't know. He stood outside the hospital door. The sound of sirens were coming from down the street. They came closer. Willard's panic grew and he ran behind a cement wall in hiding. He watched as the police cars surrounded the building. Red and blue lights flickered against the cold grey hospital walls. Car doors slammed and they began talking. \"Do you know where the body is?\" one cop asked. \"No, this is a big hospital. Let's hope no one else was killed,\" another officer replied. Standing in front of the hospital's entrance they noticed the blood on the door. Looking around to see if anyone was there the investigator pointed to another policeman and whispered, \"You, stay here. There could be more happening here than we expected.\" The investigator and the other cops entered the hospital door and they jumped as two large brown rats ran out the door. Once the policeman had disappeared into the dark hospital the cop who stood to look out turned around to light a cigarette and investigate the blood on the door once more. While the cop's back was turned Willard came out of hiding. Placing Socrates safely in his coat pocket he slowly walked down the street towards the city subway. He was free. He knew where he would go. He was going home. Willard and Socrates were finally going home. What distressed him most was the fact Ben...had returned.[Chapter 8] \"Chapter 8 - Almost Home \" Walking down the cold dark street Willard kept a close look out for more police. With his black hair and long black overcoat it was hard to notice him at all. Unexpectedly a police vehicle sped down the street. It's loud siren was deafening. He slowed his walk being sure not to look in the direction of the police vehical's headlights. The red and blue lights flickered off the trees. The car was speeding too fast to have noticed him. He took a deep breath and looked back into the direction they were heading. Bellevue. As Willard was making his way down towards the New York's subway station the New York City Police were investigating the hospital. Everything was a shambles. Wooden chairs in the waiting area were nibbled into shreds. \"Here's the light switch!\" an investigator tried flipping the lights on. Darkness continued to fill the eerie hospital hallways. Looking to the ceiling they noticed wires were dangling. The sound of gnawing echoed down the labyringth of hallways. Rats were in the ceiling. Patients in their rooms screamed and banged against their doors. \"Let's just stay together,\" one policeman whispered to the rest. They were alarmed when they saw a group of rats chewing on a nearby chair. \"Look how large they are,\" a policeman went on, \"We need to evacuate the hospital.\" \"Which patients should we release first?\" another cop asked. \"The less dangerous ones of course. They usually keep the more threatening patients on the lower levels,\" the investigator stated. \"First we need to find where they keep the keys to the patient's rooms,\" he continued. While the police were searching through the labyrinth of hallways Dr. Long, Gary, and Roy stood locked away in a cell room. \"Why did you shoot him?\" Gary asked the Roy who was still holding the gun. He stared at him blankly. Gary rolled his eyes and grabbed the gun from Roy. \"That's what I get for hiring idiots. Remind me to fire you when we get out of here,\" he snapped at the man. \"Yes sir,\" the man sighed. \"Shooting him didn't help at all. Just made things worse. No telling who else he's after. He's delirious...\" Dr. Long stated while staring at a vent on the ceiling. \"Do you have any clue where he could be heading?\" Gary asked. She replied blankly, \"Yes, back to his home.\" The police continued their way down the catacomb-like hallways. Listening closely to the patients banging against their doors. They could distinguishly hear a noise coming from a nearby room. \"Help! We're in here! I hear you out there!\" the doctor screamed through the door. \"That doesn't sound like a patient,\" they looked through the bullet proof glass window atop the door. \"How did they get in there?\" one policeman asked another. \"I can't find the key to this room. That's the only number room without a key hanging here.\" another policeman said while searching up and down a board which contained hundreds of keys and numbers written above them. \"We'll have to call the fire department to free them. I'll stay here. The rest of you span out and free the patients. We'll have them all transported to another hospital. Wait to free the ones kept on the lower level. We'll need a swat team to transport them to a prison.\" the investigator pulled on his walky-talky and phoned for back-up. Each man grabbed keys in a select order and began to free the patients on the main floor. This was a challenge. Some patients refused to move. Fifteen minutes later they had freed half the patients. They waited for back-up to help with the rest who refused to leave their rooms. While the hospital was slowly being evacuated, Willard had made his way down a street lined with fancy houses. This street looked familiar to him. The freshly rained on streets and the darkness of the night gave it the same feel as when he had first set foot there. Walking by a house with a For Sale sign in the front he stopped. A police ribbon hung in front of the driveway door. He slowly walked closer to the house and heard crying. Afraid someone may see him out their window he backed up against the cold wet walls of the house. Sliding himself against the house he slowly walked up to the window. Glancing in he saw a woman crying. \"We can't keep the house...\" he heard her talking to another woman. \"Wasn't there anything left over after Mr. Martin's death?\" this voice sounded too familiar. It was Katherine. He backed away from the window in disillusion. \"Katherine...\" he whispered. \"Shhh....\" Katherine continued, \"Do you hear that? Outside.\" The curious woman stood up and walked close to the window. Hearing what Katherine had just said he ran from the house. Katherine opened the window and glanced outside. She could barely see him as he ran away. Recognizing the way he ran, the way the overcoat hung on his shoulders, and his shiny black hair she yelled in confusion, \"Willard?\" He continued running out of sight. Katherine, thinking it couldn't have been him, closed the window. Back inside the house Katherine sat back down beside the other woman. \"What was it?\" she asked her. \"Oh...It was nothing...\" Katherine responded looking at the window. Willard was running so fast he didnt realize where he had gone. He was surprised when he noticed the New York's subway station sign hanging above the street he had stopped. Looking for the ticket master he slowly made his way through the train station. He walked towards the attendant. People stared and whispered at the sight of his pale face and nervous look. Staring at the ground, he made sure not to look into anyones direction. He slowly walked up to the attendant, gently holding his arm. It hurt excruciatingly. The bullet hadn't hit him straight on. The gash was more like a deep scratch stinging as the blood protruded from it. The tall blonde haired attendant observed Willard's actions. \"Are you alright?\" he asked Willard hesitantly. Willard slowly looked up apprehensively. \"I...\" he stared back down at the ground, \"..uh..c..could I have a...uh...ticket to downtown New York...please,\" he said timidly. \"That will be five dollars seventy five cents,\" the attendant told him. \"I..I have that,\" he said slowly now searching his pockets for his wallet. He pulled out two five dollar bills from his blood crusted wallet and slipped it under the little slit of the bullet proof window with his shaky hand. This action revealed his hospital bracelet. Blood from the gash in his arm slowly dripped down his hand. The only words the attendant could make out from the bracelet were \"Bellevue\" Thinking that maybe he had just been released from Bellevue the attendant handed him his ticket and took his money. \"Are you sure your ok? You don't look so good,\" the attendant looked at him. Willard raised his head up reluctantly, forcing a small smile upon his face. \"T...thank you\" he said slowly and walked away. \"Don't you want your change sir?!\" the attendant yelled. The train had arrived and Willard was already walking aboard. \"Whoah...\" the attendant whispered and watched as a small group of rats slipped through the doors of the train right behind Willard. As the train left the attendant turned around and picked up the phone. Once aboard the subway train, he looked around for a dark corner to sit by himself with Socrates. As he walked down the now moving train a little girl of about seven, sitting next to her mother looked at Willard. \"Mommy, what's wrong with that man?\" she asked her mother, pulling on her sleeve, who was busy reading a book. Her mother looked up and watched as Willard found a corner to sit. \"He's sad honey. Just eat your cookie,\" she patted her little girl on the head and went back to her book. The little girl looked from her cookie to Willard. She jumped out of her seat next to her mother with cookie in hand. \"Are you hungry?\" she walked up to him and asked. This suprised him and he jumped. \"I..\" he began to say. The little girl's mother grabbed her and held her in her arms. \"But I wanted to give the man my cookie,\" the little girl said sweetly. \"Alright, we'll just set it here for him ok?\" her mother took the cookie and layed it on the seat next to him. The train stopped and the mother and daughter began to leave. He slowly picked up the cookie and hesitantly yelled, \"T..thank you!\" to the little girl and her mother. They smiled and walked out the door. The train began to move again and he held the cookie in his hand. Starving, he broke it in half and consumed it in two bites. He was about to eat the other half and remembered Socrates was in his pocket. Breaking a small peice from the cookie, he slowly pulled the little white rat out of his pocket. Socrates seemed to be moving more than he was a few hours ago. \"Socrates...food.\" he whispered to the rat. Little Socrates took the small crumbs and slowly ate them. Busy feeding the little white rat what he had left of the cookie; he listened as he heard something familiar. The sound of small feet scurrying through the train. Their small feet scratched upon the metal floor. He placed Socrates back in his pocket. Before he heard anything else the train stopped. \"Down Town New York!\" he heard one of the train attendants yell. Willard nervously stood up from his seat and slowly walked out the train's door. The closer he came to home the happier he became.[Chapter 9] \"Chapter Nine - Home At Last\" He walked down the dark street. People stared but he didn't care. Pulling Socrates out of his pocket he whispered, \"Socrates...we're almost home...\" with a smile. Strangers commented on his odd behavior. \"Who's he talking to?\" a lady wearing a long red jacket told another woman in a short green shirt. \"Don't ask me. I think they should put all these bums away,\" the woman in the green shirt rudely replied. Willard heard their talk and turned around and stared back in their direction. They saw this and became uneasy. \"What are you staring at?\" the woman in green gawked. He gave them a sharp stare for the longest time. The girls were frightened. \"Come on, lets go...\" the woman in red pulled on the woman in green's arm. \"Yeah...\" she replied and they both walked away. He turned back around in the direction he was going with a look of satifaction on his face. His satisfaction quickly turned into anger when he saw a large rat running towards the road in which his house was located. \"Ben!\" he yelled and began to run. Quickly stopping when he arrived at the foot of the gate leading to his house he almost tripped but caught his balance. Yellow and black police tape covered the gate. \"Home.\" he smiled. Ripping the police tape off he opened the gate and walked up the steps. Now standing on the porch, he pulled the police tape off from around the door. There were boards nailed to the door. He pulled them off with all the strength he had. His arm continued to bleed; dripping down his arm. Opening the door, he walked inside and closed the door behind him. Willard was home. __________ Dr. Long yelled from inside the cell room. \"Can't you get us out?!\" she screamed while banging on the door. \"Help is coming lady. We have to wait till the fire department gets here. The key to this door is missing,\" he yelled back at her. She turned around and sat beside Roy on the hospital bed. \"Listen...\" he told her. He got up and placed his ear to the walls. \"It's the rats. Their everywhere,\" he whispered. The doctor looked up at a vent at the top of the wall. \"We have to cover that up,\" she got up on a chair and looked through the vent. \"If we cover it up, we won't have much of an air supply,\" Gary proclaimed. She waved her arm and whispered, \"Look at this...\" She moved from the chair and let the captian take a look. \"Oh my God...\" he exclaimed. \"Yeah, we have to get out of here. Quick,\" she replied to his cry. They all began hitting against the door screaming. Slowly more rats crawled through the vent. They gnawed at the bars which covered the air hole. The covering began to rattle. All in the room gathered at the door looking up at the vent. \"Get out your guns, we may need them...\" Gary said slowly as more rats appeared. The rats were coming. Coming for them. __________ At home, Willard was happy. Entering the eerie house. He stopped and looked around. Everything was the way he left it. The rat's damage was extensive but didn't bother Willard. He walked up the large, nibbled by rats, staircase with Socrates in hand. Once upstairs he pushed aside Scully's dead skeleton from the middle of the walkway. Walking by his mother's room he could faintly hear her cry. \"Willard! What are you doing?\" he listened. The sound was drowned out when Socrates began to squeal. He was moving better each hour that passed. The small rat crawled out of his hands and up his arm to sit on his shoulder. Willard smiled at the fact Socrates was getting better. They both entered the small bathroom where he removed Socrates from a rat trap. Closing the door he placed Socrates on the sink. Amazingly the water was still working. How could this be? Even the light worked. \"Huh,\" he smiled and ran some bath water. While the water was running, he took Socrates and walked into his bedroom. Nothing was touched. The rats didn't seem to have entered his room at all. All that was left from that dreadful night was the large hole in which Ben nibbled in his closet. He covered the hole with a large suitcase. Walking towards his dresser Socrates followed. He opened it grabbing a pair of pajamas and layed them on his bed. Acting as if nothing had happened the past few weeks he continued this routine. Him and Socrates made their way back to the bath. Once there, he removed the overcoat revealing his bloody arm. Slowly he rolled his hospital uniform sleeve up. He grabbed a washcloth, wet it and placed it over the wound. It stung but he made no sound. Walking to the bathroom door he slowly closed it. __________ The Fire Department had finally made their way to Bellevue. Crowds of people stood outside the large hospital. Just after the Fire Department a Swat Team arrived with ambulances close behind. Countless patients waited outside the towering hospital walls. Once inside, the firemen found their way towards the locked room carrying large bolt cutters. \"Finally. What took you guys so long? They've been locked in there for hours,\" the investigator proclaimed. They ignored him and began to cut the lock open. Inside the room Dr. Long, Roy, and Gary panicked as the small bars holding the rats back, popped open. Rats came falling in twenty to thirty at a time. They all turned around and banged on the door harder, screaming for their lives. Gary held his gun and pointed it at the large rats and fired. \"Hurry up!\" she yelled as the bullet ricocheted off the wall and hit Roy. He dropped the gun and backed away. His jaw dropped at what he had just done. The officer fell to the floor from the impact of the bullet. Slowly blood soaked his shirt. The security captian had shot him in the heart. Blood dripped from the Gary's mouth. He layed there dying and watched as rats crawled over his body and began to feed. Raising his hand at Gary and he said one last word, \"H..e...l...p...\" Finally the door was broken open. Rats poured out of the room. Firemen grabbed the doctor and they all ran towards the hospital's exit. The hungry rats followed close behind. They stopped when they heard the screams of people echoing down the labyrinth of halls, coming from the lower levels. \"We need to save them!\" Dr. Long screamed in terror. The firemen pushed her out the door along with everyone else. Now outside the doctor was bombarded with reporters. \"What happened here tonight Doctor?\" one asked her. She just wanted to be left alone. Tears running down her face she was grabbed by a police officer and placed into an NYPD van. Firemen grabbed flame torches and entered the hospital. An eerie sound echoed from the dark hospital. __________ Back at the Stiles estate, Willard was clean and very tired. Grabbing the little white rat, he held him up to his face and whispered, \"Socrates...let's go to bed...\" he smiled and they entered his room. Slipping under his dusty covers Socrates crawled up the blanket with him. Exhausted from the long night he quickly fell asleep with the little white rat snuggled up his sleeve. They were finally home. Home at last.[Chapter 10] \"Chapter Ten - Willard Is Back \" A harrowing feeling woke Willard from his sleep. He knew something was wrong. Firemen slowly scorched each rat that came within eye sight. With the swat team close behind they walked down the dark labyrinth of hallways towards the lower levels where the dangerous patients were being kept. Dead, scorched rat carcasses scattered the floors of the hospital. Few escaped the terror. Now in the lower levels, the swat team slowly unleashed the patients from their captivity. One by one the swat team released them into the dark hallways. Blood curdling screams mirrored the walls of the hallways which more resembled a catacomb meant to keep people who others wish to forget. Throughout this terror, patients' unleashed their wrath upon the swat team and firemen who unlocked their small dark cave-like cells. The swat team gained control of most of them; less than half of them killed each other. Half the patients made it out alive. Some couldn't be saved. They were eaten alive by the rats. \"Do you know who did this?\" Dr. Long was asked. She gazed out of the van window in awe at what was occurring. She couldn't bring herself to say a word. Bodies of countless patients were being carried out of the dark hospital. Patients which she treated. She had treated Willard....how could this happen? she thought. They were all layed in a row below the shadow of the insitutions walls. The injured cried in terror. Morning came and dark rain clowds filled the sky. Willard was already awake and dressed in a dusty suit belonging to his long dead father. He walked to the bathroom for some water. No water came out. A large gurgling noise echoed throughout the house. The lights refused to luminate the dark rooms. Everything was turned off. Grabbing Socrates he slowly walked towards his father's study. Closing his eyes he opened the door. Everything was torn apart. Glass scattered the floor from fallen pictures. Memories from the last night he had entered the room flashed before him. He placed his hands upon his head hoping it would go away. The innumerable rats attempting to kill him. But they didn't succeed...he was still here. Socrates crawled up his arm upon his shoulder and squeaked. This caught his attention and he lowered his hands, holding Socrates. He remembered what he had come into the room for. Looking on the floor he picked up two broken picture frames. One of his father, the other of his mother. Quickly, he left the room. Walking down the large staircase he heard a noise. A car door slam. Slowly he sprinted towards the window and looked outside. A white van with the words \"New York Electrical\" drove away from the front of the house. He took a deep breath, glad that it hadn't been someone else. \"Lady, you have to tell us who did this,\" Dr. Long was told. Still overwhelmed from the actions of the past night she finally brought herself to say his name, \"Willard Stiles.\" \"We'll start a statewide search. He can't have gone far. Do you have any idea where he could have gone?\" Dr. Long was interrogated. \"Yes, back home,\" she continued staring out the window in disbelief. \"Can you describe him?\" she was asked. \"Pale...very pale. Black hair...he was shot in the arm by one of the security men... Tall, blue eyes, he's very disturbed. I really should come with you when you find him,\" she said still staring outside. Dr. Long listened as the policeman grabbed his walky talky and began to phone the information in. She was quickly taken from the van into another police vehicle . Dr. Long was being taken to Willard's house and she didn't know what she would find when she got there. Placing the pictures of his mother and father in his torn and slightly nibbled up breifcase he opened the front door and walked down the front steps. He was going to complete some unfinished business. Willard was back.[Chapter 11] \"Chapter Eleven - Unfinished Business\" It still read in rusty letters \"Stiles Manufacturing\" with new words on top baring the name \"Martin\". Giving a sharp look specifically at the name Martin he opened the gate and walked inside. Police caution tape covered the elevator. Dried blood still crusted the metal floor. Willard walked inside, tearing the tape off. The elevator raised from the main floor. \"It looks like he's been here,\" Dr. Long observed the torn police tape laying on the cement sidewalk outside the Stiles Estate. \"It could have just been some kids playing around,\" one of the cops commented. \"We won't know until we go in there. Lady, you stay here incase he is in there and tries to attempt anything,\" the lead police officer told Dr. Long and pointed to another officer to stay with her. The group of cops walked up the cement stairs into the dark house. Dr. Long waited. Willard recollected what he had done to Mr. Martin while standing on top of the blood stained floor.. He smiled all the while. \"We got him back Socrates. He'll never hurt you again...\" he slowly whispered to the little white rat standing on his shoulder. Walking down the hallway he felt confident in what he was about to do. Finally at the door, which held the office where he had countless times been humiliated, he tried opening it. It was locked. He became impatient. The lock was old and rusted. It wiggled and schreeched when you pulled on it. He placed his brief case on the floor and backed away a few inchs from the door. Quickly he kicked the door handle with all the strength he had. Luckily it broke open. The floor screeched as the police entered the old dark house. \"Let's look upstairs first,\" one of the cops told the others. Cautiously holding their guns in front of them they made their way up the large staircase. Looking through the rooms they noticed things had been moved about. They entered the bathroom. Willard's hospital bracelet had been torn in half and layed upon his bloody uniform in a small garbage can sitting in the corner of the bathroom. \"He's definitly been here,\" a cop pulled the bracelet out of the basket. \"He could still be here. Keep a good look out. Let's check the basement.\" The police made their way to the kichen. \"Shhh...listen...down there,\" one of the cops whispered and pointed to the basement door. Noise came echoing from the basement. Cautiously he opened the door and began to walk down the dark stairs. Holding a small flashlight they made their way down the dark steps. \"Mr. Stiles!\" one of the cops yelled. \"Do you feel that around your feet?\" a cop holding a gun whispered to the others. \"Yeah...\" one replied. He slowly moved the flashlight towards the ground. \"Their rats! Millions of them!\" they all screamed. Attempting to escape they tried running back up the stairs. The door shut with impact by a group of rats pushing at the bottom of it. They were surrounded. Entering the office brought bad memories to the surface. He remembered how he used to cower down at the presents of his boss, Mr. Martin, who had stolen the business from his father. How he made a fool of him in front of everyone. How he made him hate himself. How he killed Socrates. But now, it has all been changed. Socrates was back. Willard would not let that happen again. He was going to make sure of that. No one will ever hurt him again... He walked into the main office where he first confronted Mr. Martin. Papers scattered the floor. His picture stating the words \"Prudent Agression\" was slanted sideway on the wall. Lowering his arm, Socrates crawled onto a chair close by. He stared at the things still standing on Mr. Martin's desk. Pictures of his family, a block of ceramic cheese, a computer, and his name which had been placed exactly in the middle of the desks front. With anger he lifted his arm and pushed everything off the desk causing them to shatter into peices onto the floor. He took deep breaths and held his arm which had still caused him great pain. Somewhat composing himself he sat in the chair under the desk. Grabbing his black bag he opened it pulling out his fathers picture. Standing it on the desk he began to cry. \"No one...will ever steal this company from you again....\" He wiped his face and Socrates crawled onto Willard's shoulder. Slightly shaken, he stood up and pulled something small and metal out of his bag. He pulled the picture stating the words \"Prudent Agression\" off the wall. Lifting the top of the metal object he lit a flame and placed it at the edge of the worded picture. Slowly he placed the picture back onto the wall. Everything around it began to catch on fire. Willard, with Socrates still standing on his shoulder, grabbed his bag and stood back watching the flames consume the room. Smoke devoured the space. Socrates crawled down his shoulder into his pocket. He began to cough and knew it was time to leave. Looking back he watched as the fire reached the desk now slowly burning his father's picture. Quickly he ran down the hall into the elevator. As the elevator slowly moved down towards the main level the smoke followed. Finally he made it to the exit. He ran through the parking lot towards the front of the building. Exiting the gate he stood back in awe at what was happening to the old building. Thunder echoed through the atmosphere and lightning lit the dark sky. Rain began to pour on the cold damp cement. \"Hey! What's going on over there?!\" a man standing across the street yelled. Suddenly lightning hit the words on top of the gate. The impact caused the metal sign of \"Martin\" to break and fall to the ground. Left on the gate was \"Stiles Manufacturing\". Willard stood there in satisfaction. The fire had now consumed the whole building. He pulled Socrates out of his pocket and held him in the rain. \"Let's go see mom...\" he whispered to the small white rat. Now hearing the sound of sirens he placed Socrates back into his pocket and ran. Dr. Long still waited outside the house for the other policemen's return. Listening to the cop's walky talky inside the car she heard the name \"Stiles\" and jumped. \"Are they talking about the Stiles Manufacturing building?\" Dr. Long exclaimed. \"Yeah, it's caught on fire,\" the policewoman sitting in the car with her replied. \"Can you take me there?\" she yelled ecstatically at the cop. \"Fine, just let me call in to the guys we're leaving.\" the policewoman attempted to contact the others inside the house but recieved no answer. \"That's odd...\" she said concerned. \"Hurry, we don't have much time!\" Dr. Long exclaimed. \"Alright, I'm sure their fine in there...\" the policewoman started up the car and they were on their way. Willard stopped running once he found the cemetery in which his mother had been buried. He walked up to her grave stone with rain pouring on his head. He sat down his black bag and opened it grabbing his mother's broken picture. Placing it at the foot of the gravestone he began to cry while rain drops rolled down his cheeks. \"Mom...we're back to see you,\" he pulled Socrates out of his pocket and placed atop her grave stone. He stood there for awhile then grabbed Socrates placing him back into his pocket. Turning around he saw police car lights coming down the street. A light flashed in his direction and he bent down out of their view. \"Let's go Socrates...By mom....\" he whispered and slowly walked off trying not to gather attention.[Chapter 12] \"Chapter Twelve - Ashes\" \"Someone has been here...\" Willard thought to himself while walking through the open gate. Slowly he walked inside. A rattling noise echoed throughout the house. Hanging his wet overcoat near the front door he locked the door behind him and followed the sound. Looking around nervously he walked towards the kitchen. The noise became louder as he entered the torn up room. Imprints were left on the dusty floor. He knew someone had been there. Following the tracks to the basement door, he stopped and placed his ear to the door to listen. He knew what was down there and he wasn't ready to face it. Dr. Long had made it to Stile Manufacturing. \"You think the escaped lunatic did this?\" Dr. Long was asked. \"Yes, were there any witnesses?\" she asked the policewoman. \"I'll find out...\" the policewoman walked away. A few minutes passed and she returned. \"They say a man with dark hair...pale face...long black overcoat...carrying an old black brief case ran away from the building an hour ago. Is that him?\" the policewoman asked. \"Yes...thats him.\" Dr. Long continued,\"Did they see which way he went?\" \"Yeah,\" the woman replied and pointed the direction where he was seen running. \"Lets go...\" Dr. Long said. \"Are you sure he would have come here?\" the woman asked Dr. Long while looking around at the countless graves that lay behind the black gate. \"Follow me.\" she replied and they walked through the graveyard gates. \"See? Look at that.\" Dr. Long bent over and picked up the broken picture of Willard's mother. \"The only other place he could have gone now is back home...\" Willard backed away from the kitchen and walked out its door. \"Dad...\" he noticed his father's urn was still in place below his large portrait. Reaching for his father's urn he rubbed the dust that had gathered on the plaque off. Socrates ran out of his pocket and hid in the other room. \"Socrates....\" he said and walked away from the urn after the scared little rat. He knew why Socrates did not want to go near the urn. Curious, he walked back towards the urn. Grabbing the heavy vase he placed it on a nearby table. Socrates stood watching in the next room as Willard raised the urn's covering. Dust from his father's dead body were the only contents of the large urn. Willard stood back in awe staring from the urn back to Socrates. The little white rat scurried towards the kitchen. He ran after him, leaving his fathers ashes open on the table. Running into the kitchen he watched as Socrates slid under the basement door. Willard stopped where he was and stood still. Closing his eyes in fear, he opened the door leading to the basement. Looking for a flashlight, he found one laying on the floor. By the feel of the flashlight, he knew it wasn't his. Clicking it on he made his way down the staircase. \"Socrates...\" he whispered. He heard something scurry across the floor running towards him. It was only Socrates. Willard knelt down and picked him up, placing him on his shoulder. Walking further into the basement he could hear something slushy on the floor as he walked. Looking up he pulled the string to a single lightbulb which hung from the ceiling. The light dimly illuminated the space. Slowly he looked down. Covering his mouth with his hands he backed away towards the staircase. What scattered the floor was blood and human tissue. Gnawed on bones seemed to swim in the pool of freshy poured blood. He quickly ran up the stairs out the basement door. Closing the door behind him, he placed his back to the door. \"Ben...\" he whispered angrily. Socrates ran off his shoulder into the next room. Blood from the little white rat's paws left marks on the shoulder of his old black suit. Willard ran after him once again with his shoes tracking blood from the basement. He chased Socrates to about the bottom of the large staircase. Stopping where he was; he could hear commotion coming from his front door. \"Stop!\" he heard a woman yell. \"There's someone in there!\" he now knew it was Dr. Long. Letting Socrates crawl upon his shoulder he stood still at the foot of the staircase with his back towards the wall. \"Lady, this house is scheduled for demolishment today.\" a man with a rugged voice told Dr. Long. \"Not anymore,\" the policewoman ran up to the front door of the house. \"This house is under our watch. I'm sure they can corroborate,\" the policewoman pointed down the street where more police cars were driving towards the house. Police began to surround the Stiles Estate. \"What could we do...what could we do...what could we do...what could we do...\" Willard stood there looking around for anything to help him. Glancing at the table where he had left his father's urn, his jaw dropped. A large gray rat stood beside the urn which had been tipped over. His father was now scattered around the floor and the table's top. The rat moved foward further from the urn's side and stopped. \"Ben!\" he yelled in a panic. This yell caught the attention of the people standing outside his door. They began to knock on the locked door. \"Mr. Stiles! Come out slowly with your hands up!\" he heard a policeman yell. \"Who's in there?\" asked the man with the rugged voice. \"Don't you read the papers? That's Willard Stiles. He escaped from Bellevue last night. Almost killed half the people there,\" a policeman replied to the man's question. \"He isn't going to come out like that!\" Dr. Long pushed aside the policeman and began to talk. \"Mr. Stiles! It's Dr. Long. I'm only here to help you. Just unlock the door so I can!\" Placing his hands upon his now dried head he looked from the door back to Ben; staring back at him with his vengeful gaze. He was trapped.[Chapter 13] \"Chapter 13 - Willard's End\" He was trapped. With no way of getting out. Willard looked up the staircase being sure not to move. Socrates ran off Willard's shoulder up the large staircase. He ran after the little white rat knowing Socrates would help him. He made it up the stairs and watched as the little white rat ran into his father's study. Willard followed. Looking back, Ben was following him. Entering the room, Socrates ran up the spiral staircase. Staring down at Willard the little rat had a look in it's small red beady eyes. Willard followed. The gray atmosphere slowly turned black and it became night. Rain continued to fall from the sad sky. \"I heard footsteps,\" Dr. Long continued,\"We need to get inside!\" The policeman exchanged a few words and decided to break the bars off one of the windows. Dr. Long stood back and stared at the many windows of the house. Returning with sharp saw's the police began to cut into the thick black bars which covered one of the many barred windows. Willard stopped once at the spiral staircases top. Ben followed quickly behind. It stopped and stared at Socrates. They stared at each other as Willard watched. \"Ben!\" he yelled. The large gray rat's eyes seemed to peirce through Socrates with extreme anger. Socrates glared back protectively standing in front of Willard. He backed away closer to the tinted yellow window. Willard searched around for anything...anything to prevent Ben from hurting Socrates...and himself as well. Dr. Long looked up and noticed his shadow in the window. \"Look! He's up there!\" she pointed at the tinted yellow window. \"We're almost in lady!\" a policeman yelled back at her. She knew...if Willard attempted anything...it would cost her, her job. The sound of an army marched up the large staircase. Millions of gray, black, and brown rats of all sizes ran in what appeared to be a reverse waterfall up the stairs towards the spiral staircase. Listening to this the police stopped sawing. \"Listen to that...\" one of the cops looked through the window,\"We don't want to go in there. That man's a goner.\" Dr. Long continued to stare at the window in which Willard was standing. \"I'll go in there,\" she said determinedly. \"You would risk getting eaten alive for that guy?\" the policewoman asked her. Dr. Long stared from the woman to the window with an angry look,\"No, not for him. For me,\" she said coldly. The many rats began to fill the room just as the first time Willard had been put in this situation. Ben and Socrates still stared at each other with great anger. Everyone outside stood back and watched in anticipation at the shadow in the window atop the large house. The rain stopped Ben gave one last look at Socrates and jumped. Willard quickly grabbed Socrates and attempted to kick Ben out of the way. Looking down at all the rats, he panicked. Looking from the rats to the window he had only one way to go. Still holding Socrates he jumped through the yellow tinted window. Hitting the ground with impact he still held Socrates in a tight embrace. He slowly lost strength and his body went limp, releasing Socrates from his grip. Dr. Long grabbed Socrates and held him in her hands. He bit her hand, jumped out of her grasp, and ran towards the house full of numerable rats. \"Is he still alive?\" Dr. Long was asked. She held her hand for a moment then knelt down beside Willard's body and tried to find a pulse. Standing up with a smile she said,\"Yes, he's still alive.\" An ambulance quickly arrived and they placed his unconcious body onto a gurny. \"Will he ever come out of it?\" Dr. Long was asked. She watched as they carried him into the ambulance. \"No\" she said blankly and entered the ambulance with Willard. Before closing the ambulance door the little white rat quickly ran inside and hid under a box of syringes. This was the end for Willard. Socrates remained by his side. -Fin- ______________________ Oh! You think thats the end do you? Well your wrong! Wrong indeed! Read further. I dare you. -Now to end this aweful fan fic of mine. I probably won't be writing another one again. I've decided my writing skills suck too much. Well enjoy the rest!- ______________________ Ten months passed without any sign of Willard's recovery. Dr. Long remained caring for him. She was happy he had not died...otherwise she would be out of a job. She took great pleasure in watching over him. Not letting anyone else near him. She seemed to grow attached. Socrates stayed close to Willard's side. Smart enough as to stay away from Dr. Long as much as he could. The night was as dark as the night Willard had jumped to his coma. Dr. Long entered the room to check his IV as usual. Clicking the light on brightened the dim room. What sat upon Willard's body surprised her. Socrates glared at the doctor with anger. She moved closer towards the rat. She reached over Willard's body to grab Socrates. Before she could grasp the little rat in her hands. Willard opened his eyes. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own the rights to the character of Willard. This fan fiction story is for ente"}]
