[{"Movie":"Gone In 60 Seconds","Title":"Toby and the girl next door","Author":"TheMysteriousCM","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3345795","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Toby and the girl next door Summery: After the fiasco with Calitri was over kip and his group still couldn't get enough of the boost life. To ovoid run-ins with the cops as they were already to suspicious they move to Miami. While there kip runs into a little competition, a group getting all the action and they end up with nothing. In secret Toby finds love in the young girl on the opposing team. I stare out the window, a distraction from the aching pain I still feel in my arm. After 2 months and many painkillers I still felt the gunshot wound in my arm. Kip and the group felt we were missing something, we weren't complete. The feeling of a boost was like no other, the cash wasn't so bad either. We all knew we could never become clean. The cops were still on close watch, just waiting for a chance to nail us. Even after Castlebeck let Memphis walk he wouldn't be so kind as to do it again. The group had pretty much broken up. Sphinx went back to the morgue, Memphis and sway stayed with Otto in his shop fixing up cars, trying to pretend to live normal lives, Atley just seamed to disappear one day, and Donny left for the DMV. The rest stayed going back to the tight-knit group we once were before Kip got into trouble and Memphis stepped in. We decided to drive the trip to Miami, the days spent in the car had us all getting a little restless, but we couldn't afford to take the risk of flying. The cops would have surveillance all over are asses. Kip was the one driving; we 'borrowed' a car that could fit all of us comfortably inside. We had about one more hour to go. As the car pulled into the driveway I hurriedly jumped out the door, after weeks of being cramped with four men in a car I was in no hurry to even look at one. \"Hey, Toby get your bag,\" Freb called out. I started to turn around when the bag just smacked me in the face. I was about to go retaliate when my eyes turned to the street. A gorgeous redhead was out jogging. I just took in the sight, expecting her to just keep on going, ending my pleasurable view when she turned into the driveway of the house beside ours. My God, could I ever be so lucky just yards away lived the hottest girl I had ever seen. \"I see lover boy found someone already, little young for my taste though,\" Kip commented. \"Oh, please we've been here like what, three minutes and you think I've fallen for a complete stranger?\" I questioned. \"Oh, so it's normal you drool at any girl that passes your way, I swear she gave you the weirdest look, probably thought you were mentally retarded.\" Great, so I just sat there and drooled at her while she came back from her jog, real smooth Toby. ------- I was sweating profusely, five extra miles in my jog today was beginning to take it's toll. I was in desperate need of a tall glass of water and a bubble bath. I turned the corner leading to the street my house was on; almost there I could see it already. As I got closer I noticed the house next to mine wasn't vacant like it normally was. A metallic blue 2006 Porsche cayenne Turbo sat in the driveway. About four guys were around it, seaming to have just stepped out of the car from a long trip they were all a little edgy. Think I should go and visit them later, after they situated themselves. I was just about to enter my driveway when I saw around the other side of the Cayenne, a fifth one from the group came to view. Damn was he hott, but I felt like I had seen him somewhere, shrugging it off I kept on jogging. He was talking to a friend when all the sudden he was hit in the face with a bag. I tried to suppress a giggle, it was quite amusing. It looked as if he was about to tackle the guy, but he looked out to the road, I wasn't sure what he was looking at, then it hit me, he was staring at me. It was quite weird to have a very attractive guy stare at me; I felt a blush creep up my face. Thankfully no one could see because I was to far away. I just wanted to disappear; I raced inside and closed the door behind me. I sunk down to the floor and my imagination got away with me. It had been so long since I had been in a relationship, I was sorely out of practice at this. I mean I was still in high school and my last boyfriend was in 10th grade, I was a senior now. I just never had time for them. My cousins would be coming home soon, maybe they would have advice on this stuff. He was the only one that looked close to my age. I wonder if he still goes to high school and if he could possibly go to mine. Damn, I did it again; my imagination was getting away from me. Pealing myself from the ground I headed to the bathroom, remembering what I thought before about a bath. It might clear my head. After stripping down I dipped my toe into the tub, inching my way into the steaming hot water. Now this was the life, if only I had someone to go fetch me a cold glass of water. I sat there for an hour my fingers had turned into complete prunes, but I didn't care I was daydreaming about a certain blond someone. Snap out of it I told myself, I don't even know him. He could be a complete psychopath for all I knew. I pulled myself out of the tub and grabbed a towel, reaching over I grabbed the plug to the drain. Lukewarm water swirled down and out of sight. Walking to my bedroom I shivered at the cold and walked faster. Going to my dresser I pulled clothes for tonight out, my cousins were taking me clubbing. There was one downtown that welcomed teens but stamped your hand so you couldn't get alcohol. I didn't mind, would rather not have a hangover in the morning and the dancing sounded more appealing anyway. The sound of the door opening and voices came from downstairs, they were home now. I quickly through some lounging clothes on and ran down stairs. I was happy I got to spend the summer with my cousins. Even though they lived a few streets away from my house my mom agreed on no checkups. \"Hey, Elena, you guys were gone for along time,\" I said. \"Aww, damn, Evie we never knew you would miss us that much,\" Allen joked. \"Did you see the hotties that moved next door?\" Alisa said while she walked through the door, hands full of shopping bags. After they all put away there stuff from today in there rooms they all came back out to crash in the living room. \"After 11:00 let's leave to go to the club, plan to stay out till 2:00 maybe 3:00,\" Allen said, breaking the silence. \"I don't see how you guys can be on your feet all day and then want to go clubbing still,\" I said. \"Comes with years of practice,\" Alisa replied. \"Hey, let's invite the new neighbors to come with us, break the ice a little.\" I cautiously put in, hoping they didn't realize my hidden agenda. \"Now Evie, This doesn't have anything to do with a certain little blond haired someone does it?\" Allen quipped. \"No!\" I said a little too forcefully. \"Right, well in any case I think it's a grate idea, they probably don't know anyone around here and let's not let them sit at home on a Friday night.\" Elena said back. I was always closer to Elena. She was the most sober of the group and understood me better. Coming to my rescue when Allen and Alisa started in on me. I felt I could come to Elena with my problems. I had a feeling she was the reason my mom let me stay here, trusting her a little more than the others. Who defiantly are a wild pair when put together. Some thought it weird, all of them being related as brother and sisters to live in the same house, but I truly knew they were all inseparable. They also shared a secret they would only trust with family. I was kept out of the loop on most of it, but what I did know was they stole cars and sold them to buyers. Being able to live in the luxurious house they did would cost a pretty penny the straight way. At first I felt it wrong, going against everything I had learned, but the first time I got behind the wheel of a car, the power of the engine just got me hooked. I was with my cousins so I just let her fly. The adrenaline rush I felt was like no other. Hitting that petal just as hard as I could, I knew why they did it. And I would gladly help. Around 7:00 I said it was time to go over but Elena said she wanted a nap before we left. Alisa was at the computer and told me to go on over and ask them myself. As my last resort I walked up to Allen. \"Please come with me, as moral support then,\" I quickly said after the annoyed look he gave me. \"Oh come on just go already or don't ask them at all,\" Giving me his I'm to lazy look. This will be very embarrassing. I walked out the door, grabbing a jacket as I went. I was in a spaghetti strap top with some cotton boxers, my hair soaking the jacket as I put it on, my long red hair took forever to dry when I put it in a ponytail. I might not have looked good at the moment but I hoped to make up for it by the outfit I had planed for tonight. Walking along the sidewalk I wished I had brought shoes as the ruff concrete scuffed my feet. As I reached the door I really whished at least one of them had come, I would even take Allen at the moment. I rang the doorbell and waited for someone to answer. \"Coming, someone called from the hallway.\" As the door opened I saw the guy who was staring at me earlier. Blushing under his intense gaze, I hoped he wouldn't notice. We just sat there for a moment silent, when I remembered why I came. \"My cousins and I would like to welcome you to your new home.\" Oh god please let him have heard me. \"We want the invite you to go clubbing.\" There I said it, not so hard. Then another person came to the door, he seemed to be restraining himself from something. But he still held confidence like he owned the place. \"Sure we would love to go,\" he said. \"Ok, were going around 11:00, you can just follow us there in your cayenne,\" I replied. \"Oh, I almost forgot my name is Kip and this kid beside me is Toby.\" I smiled feeling like he was the kind of guy you just can't help but feel comfortable with. \"I'm Evie, and I'll introduce you to my cousins later,\" I said. \"Well since all the guys are here I'll introduce you to them now, be back in a moment.\" He left the doorway and down the hall to go find the others. I then realized Toby was still right beside me, he hasn't said a thing the entire time I had been here. He must be very shy. \"So how long will you guys be here?\" I asked, trying to start a conversation. \"Oh, um. We plan to stay here awhile. The five of us all came from California to make a new start,\" Toby said. Wow that a long ways away, something really bad must have happened to travel so far to avoid something in there past in such a drastic way. \"Well that's good to hear that you'll stay awhile, is this your first time in Miami?\" great, soon well be talking about the weather. \"Yes, for all of us-,\" he was cut off by kip coming back with the whole gang. \"So here's everyone. That's Tumbler.\" He pointed to a man that's was very bulk but in a sexy was, looking like he had just woken up. \"Mirror Man is over there with the sades permanently attached to his face.\" Pointing to another wearing dark shades, while it was dark outside with a yellow and black beanie. \"That's Freb.\" And last but not least his finger was pointed in the direction of a floppy haired boy with very pale skin, nothing I can complain about as my completion isn't so tan either, what I get for being a redhead. \"Everyone this is Evie, she lives next door. Evie and her cousins want us to go clubbing,\" He announced. I felt nervous with so many stares coming my way. \"I'll see you guys around 11:00, but I have to go.\" They all said there goodbyes and I made my way home. \"There that wasn't so bad, my little Evie is growing up and inviting strangers to go clubbing because she thinks one is hott, how cute,\" Allen taunted as I walked in the door. \"Not now, Allen. I need to get ready and I'm not in the mood.\" I know I snapped at him but I needed to think. I didn't need Allen's nagging tonight. I looked over at the bedside table, the clock shown 9:30, I really did need to get ready. I walked over to the bed and picked up what I was to wear tonight. A black mini-skirt with a sage halter top that showed off my back almost completely, and matching green stiletto heels. I pulled my hair into a fishnet braid that ran the length of mid back, I then added silver hoops to finish off my outfit. I just sat in my room reading Harry Potter FanFiction until time to go. Around 10:40 I closed the lid to my laptop and went down stairs. This will be a night to remember. Whether it be good or bad. I just hope I don't embarrass myself horribly. AN: Thank you for reading my story. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did writing it. Reviews are always welcome, but most importantly sit back, relax and have a good time. PS-No I didn't stop my other story.

Title- Back in SixtynSeconds Chapter 1 She gazed around the old,ndusty, abandoned room. The pictures seemed ancient, and in fact werenin her family's oldest generations. It was hard to believe that theynall had forgotten this place. But for what and why? All its cars hadnbeen left behind to rust, sad really, and now probably had a slimnchance at being revived and working properly. Tinkie bobble-heads andnexpensive car models rested on shelves above the many sports carsnthat seemed to have had a lot of effort and time put into them. Oilnand gasoline covered tools layed aside on the wooden and metalntables, not even bothered to be put back into their drawers and onntheir hooks. The young woman walked tonthe far corner of the room, where a office room was. She peeked innand saw an old rauting desk and rat-chewed, fabricated chair, alongnwith a key chain holder. As if feeling like she was going to get inntrouble, she tiptoed around the rubble and grabbed all the keys. Whennthey were in her hands, she walked outside the office and back intonthe garage. Swiftly, the womannmatched the keys up with the vehicles and reved the engines to see ifnthey worked. Only one of the five had not worked, and that was a 67'nVoltswagon bug that had a black paint job with red and orange flamesncoming from the front to the back. It was a cute, but fiesty, lookingncar, too bad it didn't work. Her phone rang and shenquickly put aside her task and answered it. \"EleanornWayland-Raines speaking,\" There was a brief pause. \"Oh, hindad...No nothing at all, just exploring around I guess...Yeah, I'llnbe back in time for dinner...Alright, bye.\" She hung up andnopened the garage doors. Fresh air filled her lungs and thenwarmsunlight beat down on her sunkissed skin. Today was the perfectnday to uncover old family secrets. Hours passed as Eleanornremoved garbage from the garage and piled them up in the back of an07' Ford F-350 SD Pickup, that belonged to the family for haulingnthings around, and sent it to the junkyard. Modeled cars andnbobble-heads got wrapped in bubble wrap and put gently in boxes. Thensports cars were driven to the other side of the garage to be washednand cleaned from the inside out. Eleanor sat on the top ofna '67 Chevy Impala and rested for a minute. She looked tiredly at hernwatch and realized the time; one hour before dinner time and she hadnto drive home and take a shower. The dark detailed woman got off thenImpala and jumped into the driver's seat of the Pickup. It took about ten tonfifteen minutes to get back to the house, and then an additionalnthirty minutes to take a shower and rid the filth of her body and bendecent for dinner. When she got out and arrived in the kitchen, shensaw her father looking out the window seemingly, but really lookingnat a picture of her mother, Sara \"Sway\" Wayland. Her mothernhad died a few years back when she was late for work and was speedingndown a winding mountian to get there. She had blown a tire and rannstraight into a tree, causing instant death. \"Hey dad.\"nEleanor simply greeted and sat at the table, where her plate wasnalready made and still warm. Quicky and politely, she scarfed it downnand sat on the opposite side of her father, Memphis Raines. \"How was your daynEleanor? You didn't get pulled over for speeding or anything likenthat did you?\" Memphis asked demandingly and overprotectively.nShe expected it, but hated that he wouldn't trust her. Not only didnshe lose her mother from a car accident, but she lost her uncle, KipnRaines, when his car's wires were messed with and it blew up on him.nShe had asked why, but her father never told her why he was murdered.nAt least he went out with his favorite car, a 80' Plymouth Hemi Cuda. \"No sir. I've beenngood, just roming around town, trying to find something new to donother than hang out with the others.\" His daughter answered,nreleaving his mind and allowing him to set down his coffee that hadngone cold. \"Good, thats good.nReally, thats all I expect from you; to not be wild with cars. Othernthan that, you're a free girl.\" Daddy Raines stood from hisnchair and walked to the living room and sat in his favorite seat andnwatched his show. Her head swung back in frustration and she noticednthere was still daylight to work on the garage. \"Hey dad, I'll benback sometime later tonight. I got things to go do.\" Eleanornsaid, knowing he didn't hear, and grabbed the keys to the truck andnleft back to her newfound treasure. She had broken hernfather's wishes and sped back to the garage, to excited to withholdnherself. Within minutes, she arrived at the garage, still seeing thencars parked and ready to be cleansed of ancient dust bunnies. Eleanornfound herself walking back inside and grabbing the pictures offnshelves and packing them up in a box like she did with the othernitems. As she ran her fingersnover a picture of a group consisting of her parents, uncle, andnfamily friends, she felt as if it was to thick. Her mind raced, andnthen the picture frame slipped out of her hands on shattered like anbullet to glass on the floor. Eleanor quickly squated down to cleannup the mess, and ran across a folded paper, which had made it feelnthicker. Curiously, Eleanor openednit, and discovered a buried truth: a boost list made out years back.nHer eyes read all the car years, brands, and names. Then, she camenupon a certain sports lady: the GT550, or, Eleanor. \"No hendidn't...\". Her mouth gawked as she realized, her parents namednher after a car they boosted.

Kris rolled her dark eyes. \"Well, I know how to build a car from the ground, up.\" She answered, moving a piece of dark hair from her face. \"Will you two stop arguing!\" Toby whispered, holding the flashlight. Kris smirked at her boyfriend, Toby, the handsome, computer geek. \"Sorry.\" She then turned to Kip, \"Come on...\" \"Got it!\" Kip stated as the engine roared to life. \"It's about time, Raines...\" Kris said, with sarcasm as she got into the car and they were off. \"What's next on the list?\" Kip asked.

Since I was a girl and the youngest I was of course always being watched over but as time went on the relationship that all of us had changed.We didn't hang out, Randall was off doing his boosts, Kip was off messing with girls he didn't even need to know and I was stuck alone. I had never been a very social person so when we grew apart it left me with very few options, so I put everything I had into school. I wanted to get out, make the big bucks but I wanted to do it the right way or at least what they taught us. I was 16, Kip was 18 and Randall was 25 when things really changed. Randall and I had always had a close relationship, he was like a father to me, he had always watched over me and I cared about him. Kip and I had a different relationship, we weren't exactly involved with each other but there was some things that happened. The day that Randall said he was leaving was hard on everyone, especially Kip. When Randall left everything changed, Kip changed. He didn't want to be anything like him anymore but I think he went the wrong way. Randall boosted cars to live and Kip lived for boosting and I couldn't deal with it. When I turned 18 I went to college in New York and I didn't plan on ever going back to Long Beach but when I was 22 I heard Randall was back and I knew I had to go back too. Driving back into the old neighborhood gave me this overwhelming feeling that I didn't know how to explain, good and bad, happy and sad, I had never felt so confused before. My car was old and barely made the trip there, I pulled into my mom's driveway and walked into the house. The stale smell instantly filled my nose and the feeling of why I left came back. I went to my mom's room and saw Helen sitting with her. \"Candy is that you?\" She practically yelled walking over to me and hugging me. \"Yeah it's me.\" I said hugging back. \"How is everything?\" I asked. \"Fine fine, we thought you were never coming back.\" She said smiling. \"No I am back, to visit. I missed this place.\" I said honestly. \"I heard that Randall was back.\" I asked more than said. \"Yeah, Memphis is back, no one calls him Randall anymore.\" She said looking away. \"Is everything ok?\" I asked concerned. \"Yeah it's just that Memphis and Kip got into some trouble a couples days ago but everything is fine and now you are back, its perfect timing.\" She said. \"Do you know where they might be?\" I asked. She explained what garage they were working at and then I was off to find Memphis, seeing Kip was different and I wasn't looking forward to that. I walked into the garage owned by Memphis's friend Otto, it seemed pretty empty actually. There was one guy who immediately got up and walked over to me. \"So what seems to be the problem?\" He asked staring at me. \"Um, I was actually looking for someone-\" I started. \"I am willing to help in anyway possible, anything you desire.\" He said. \"Ok…do you know Memphis?\" I asked stepping back slightly. \"Yeah, he isn't here right now actually but he should be.\" He answered. \"Otto is here though.\" \"Can I talk to him?\" I asked, he nodded. Five minutes later Otto came out looking surprised. \"Well I think the cows are flying.\" He said smiling at me. \"No I don't think there are any cows.\" I laughed. \"So how long are you here?\" He asked. \"Not too long, just a short visit. Who is that?\" I asked pointing to the guy. \"Don't worry about him, that's Tumbler. Memphis should be here, Kip is in the back if you want me to get him.\" He said about to leave. \"Uh, no that's ok. I just wanted to see Memphis.\" I said too quickly. \"OK?\" He said just as the door opened and Memphis came in. \"I heard that you were here but I was not too sure.\" Memphis yelled across the room. I ran over to him and hugged him. \"Gosh, its so good to see you. I can't believe you came back after all that time.\" I said with my arm still around his waste. \"Of course I would, I was a little sad when I heard you were gone.\" He said half hugging me with his arm around my shoulder, just then a woman walked in. She looked at Memphis suspiciously and then angrily at me. I guess Otto noticed and was quick to clear the confusion. \"Oh so you are Candy? I have heard a lot about you, I'm Sway.\" She shook my hand. \"Where is Kip?\" She asked looking around, Otto pointed to the back. \"Kip!\" Memphis yelled and I shifted uncomfortably, lucky for me only Sway noticed and was kind enough not to point it out. Kip walked out the back room, he was halfway across the garage when he noticed me, and he stopped and stared for a second too long making everyone else quiet. \"Candy?\" He asked just above a whisper. \"Hey Kip.\" I said in a less than enthusiastic voice. \"I didn't uh, why are you…when did you get here?\" He asked unsure. \"It doesn't matter.\" I answered shortly. The tension in the room was growing and everyone could tell. \"Of course not.\" He said rolling his eyes. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" I asked raising my voice slightly. \"Why does it have to mean something?\" He said getting louder too. \"So it doesn't mean anything at all?\" I asked taking a step away from Memphis. \"Why are you doing this?\" He asked softer now. \"What am I doing?\" I asked. \"This, you have to make a big deal out of everything.\" He said getting closer now. \"I am not making a big deal, you are the one saying things that 'don't mean anything'.\" I said rolling my eyes now. \"Oh whatever, this is so typical.\" He said shaking his head. \"Typical? I can see you didn't change at all.\" I said. \"Neither did you.\" He said smiling sarcastically. \"Did I miss something?\" Memphis asked looking at both Kip and I. \"When I left you two were like best friends?\" He asked more than stated. \"That was six years ago.\" I replied. \"Six very long years ago.\" Kip added. \"I am going to finish the other car.\" He said as he turned and left. Everyone turned and looked at me. \"What?\" I asked. Everyone just shrugged and walked away except Memphis. \"Lets go for a walk.\" He suggested grabbing my hand. We walked out the garage and started to walk, no place special. \"What is going on with you and Kip?\" Memphis asked once we were far enough. \"I don't know it's confusing. He didn't want me to leave I guess.\" I answered. \"Well if you ask me-\" \"I'm not.\" I cut in. \"Anyway, it seems like there is more. I never understood you two, when we were younger you two loved each other, than hated each other, then I left and you both seemed to be like best friends and now it's like you don't even want to see him.\" He said, he stopped and sat on a bench. \"I don't want to see him.\" I said. \"Why? What could Kip have done to make you hate him so much?\" He asked. \"I don't hate him, I never hated him.\" I said looking away. Memphis put his arm around me bringing me closer to him. \"Don't worry, whatever happened will go away eventually but you can't run away from him.\" He said softly. I smiled slightly because even now that I was 22 it still amazed me that Memphis knew everything without me telling him. We walked back to the garage in silence because we knew there was nothing more to be said, the problems that me and Kip had Memphis couldn't fix.That night everyone decided to go to a bar that Sway worked at and Memphis wanted me to go. I knew he was just trying to get me and Kip together but I didn't want to sit at home alone so I went. We were all having fun when it started to get late. One by one everyone began to leave and soon it was just Kip, Tumbler and me. It was awkward, I wanted to leave but I didn't want to go home. \"So you want to go-\" Tumbler started. \"I'm not that drunk.\" I said, he smiled. \"Fine, I will remember that when you realize how wonderful-\" \"Just leave her alone.\" Kip said clearly annoyed. Tumbler had been hitting on me the whole night, all in good fun but Kip didn't like it and made that known. I didn't care to be honest. \"Relax man, it's just a joke.\" Tumbler responded angrily and left. \"So much for that.\" I said to no one. \"Why are here?\" Kip asked suddenly. \"Excuse me?\" I asked. \"You heard me, why did you come back now?\" He asked. \"I wanted to come back the second I left.\" I stated. \"But you didn't so why now? What changed?\" \"I came back because I heard Memphis was back and just because I didn't come back doesn't mean that I didn't want too.\" I said feeling hurt. \"You shouldn't have ever left.\" He said barely loud enough for me to hear. \"I had too.\" I said softly. \"No you didn't.\" He said louder now. \"You made me leave.\" I said feeling angry. \"I would never make you leave.\" He said getting closer to me now. \"I asked you to stop and you didn't listen, I had to leave. I wasn't going to risk being involved and you knew that.\" \"I know but I couldn't help it.\" He said looking down. \"I don't believe that, you could have stopped. You didn't want too and that's fine but I got over it and things are different now.\" I said. \"No they aren't.\" He said. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"I loved you, I still do and I won't ever stop and it killed me everyday knowing that you weren't here and it was my fault.\" He said looking at me now. \"It wasn't completely your fault.\" I said feeling guilty now. \"I didn't have to go all the way to New York; I just wanted to not feel anymore.\" I began to feel tears. \"You hurt me a lot and when I told you I was leaving you acted like you didn't care.\" I said. \"I know but it was a lie because I couldn't let myself get hurt. After Memphis left I couldn't think about anyone else leaving me.\" He said. \"You should've called me, I would've come back.\" I said. \"I'm sorry I didn't call.\" He said now closer than before.

Uncle Kip!\" Meria yelled at her uncle from undernthe hood of the Chili Red Mini Cooper that had come into the Garage thatnmorning. \"What?\" Kip answered with an irritated tone. \"This guy's Coop has some seriously damaged shock absorbers. There'snoil seeping on the piston rod and the outer tube's dented,\" Meria answered,n\"He's lucky he brought it in when he did or he might have been splatterednon the side of the road by tomorrow.\" \"Shit. Well, that guy didn't look like he knew shit about cars.nMake sure you tell him what to check for when he comes to pick it up,nalright?\" \"Yeah, alright.\" Meria answered, looking for the guy's phone numbernto call him up and give him the prices for installing the new shocknabsorbers. She was getting really good. Kip knew it; Meria was getting more andnmore sure of herself everyday. Kip supposed it helped having her dad, mom,nuncle, aunt, and everyone else who helped to raise her as ex-car thievesnthough, even though she didn't have the slightest idea about their unlawfulnpasts. However, he didn't think, those 14 years ago, just a year and 2nmonths after the death of Kalitri, when Memphis and Sway had Meria that shenwould be such an excellent mechanic. Kip swept his greasy fingers through his even greasier brown hair,nand looked around at the Raines' Garage, the best garage in Long Beach.nMemphis and he had purchased it just 1 year after Meria had been born. Andnthey all worked it, Kip, Memphis, Sway, and Boxer. It had grown real big,nthey had 5 separate garages in one garage, and they'd had to hire 5 extranguys to help out with it plus the four of them and Meria stopping in tonhelp out after school. They'd made it through all the bumps along the waynand for the last year and a half things have been closer to perfect thennthey had in a very long time. Kip let out a huge sigh at the thought ofnthat and went back to working on the 2003 Nissan 350Z he'd been working onnall morning. ****** \"Hello?\" The Cooper's owner answered after the 2nd ring. \"Hi, this is Meria from Raines' Garage, and I'm calling about yournMini Cooper.\" Meria responded in her most professional voice. \"Oh, yeah, did you find out what was wrong with it?\" Meria rolled her eyes, \"Yes, your shock absorbers need immediatenreplacing.\" \"Oh,\" the guy said sounding obviously confused, \"And what's thatngoing to cost me?\" \"It depends on what you want, basically we have the ones guaranteednto last you 5 years or the ones that'll last you 3 years. The one'snthat'll last 5 will cost about 200 and the 3 years will cost about 150.\" \"Ok, let's do the 5 years,\" The guy said, sounding a little unsure. \"Ok, it should be ready in about 4 hours, but we'll call you and letnyou know when it's done.\" \"Ok. Thanks.\" \"You're welcome, bye.\" Meria hung up and let out a big sigh, people like that bugged her.nPeople that didn't even know the basics of a car, all they knew was wherento put the key. She wiped her greasy hands on an already oily rag lying on herntoolbox, and put her bleached blonde hair up. She hoped no one from schoolnshowed up tonight, her wife beater was covered in grease and her pants werenpractically stained black. She didn't think they would but on a Friday shennever really knew. She got a shock absorber from the supply closet and then started tonremove the old one. She remembered the first time she was allowed to worknon a car. She was 10 and she had been watching her mom work on cars asnlong as she could remember. She watched every time she had replaced annengine, changed oil, done a tune up, changed the tires, found a dead shocknabsorber. Her mom told her everything to look for in every situation, andnMeria absorbed it like a dry sponge. And the first time she worked on ancar, she had to replace the valve on a PCV system. She knew then and therenshe wanted to work with cars for the rest of her life. Her parents andnaunt and uncle, and Auto, and Donny, and everyone had all sat back andnwatched the whole thing, and after she finished, they all clapped. Shenfelt herself blush scarlet but she felt great just the same. With thatnlast bit of reminiscing she finished installing the new shock absorber.nHer uncle was standing against the wall with his arms folded across hisnchest and his foot against the wall behind him. \"Good job, kid.\" He said, unsurprised, \"Now go home, your mom called,nand dinner's ready for ya. I'll call the guy and tell him his Coop'snready.\" \"Alright, Uncle Kip.\" Meria said as she picked up her bag off thenfloor, \"See ya later!\" Meria walked out of the garage to see the setting sun in thendistance. Her house was only a 10 minute walk away, so she decided to takenher time and make it 15 instead. She breathed in the air of Long Beach.nShe'd been born and raised here, and she loved it. She looked up and sawnthe small feathery clouds going from deep pink to orange. It was perfect,nespecially since the road was almost always deserted at this time. Suddenly Meria noticed something she hadn't noticed during hernintoxication of the sunset, tires, slowly rotating behind her. She didn'tnlook back, didn't feel the need to. She just kept looking around,nobserving everything around her. She realized she didn't just stop to looknat things enough. But a minute later, the car was still behind her. Evennthough she was walking rather slowly, it still hadn't passed her. A surgenof slight panic went through her body. She felt the beat of her heartntriple. She counted to 3 in her head. One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi,nthree-Mississippi. She started to sprint. The car sped up and passed her,nbut stopped 10 feet in front of her. The passenger door opened and anfigure in black ran towards her out of it. She screamed and sprinted pastnhim, but was swiftly caught. She felt a large gloved hand cover her mouthnand the figure yank her towards the silver GTO and throw her violently innthe back, while getting in himself. As soon as she felt his hand leave hernmouth she let out an ear-piercing scream. She felt something hit the backnof her head hard, and she went weak and plunged into darkness.

Due to the overwhelming response and pleads for a sequel ornfill in, here it is! Summary: After the team rescues Junie from the hands of Johnnie B and hisngang, Sway tells Memphis she's pregnant. This story is meant to fill in angap or two from the first story. \"I hate being fat! I hate being fat!\" Sway growled through hernteeth. She couldn't ride her beloved motorcycle this way, let alone fitnbeneath a car. She was forced to take extra time off and stay off hernfeet. \"Honey, you are not fat.\" Memphis said, walking into their livingnroom and fluffing a pillow to put behind her before cracking open a beernand sitting next to her. Sway rolled her eyes. That was another thing-shencouldn't drink. If Memphis had not developed this 'perfect husband'ncomplex lately, Sway would have ripped Memphis' head off like a prayingnmantis long ago. She stared with contempt at the can in his hand, and herneyes narrowed into angry slits. \"What? Does this bother you?\" he said, complete with mock innocence. \"Starting early aren't you?\" Sway replied. \"Yeah, I figure if you can't drink, I might as well get shit-facednfor the both of us,\" Memphis replied, tipping the can back again. \"Gimme that can,\" Sway ordered. \"Sorry, sweetie, this means too much to me.\" \"If you love me, you'll give me that beer,\" Sway insisted. It didn'tnwork. \"Oh, no, you are not getting away with it that easy. You are a weeknand a half from your due date, and our perfect baby is not going to get FASnnow,\" Memphis said, shaking the can to get the last of the drink, \"Oops.nSeems that that's the end of it, honey.\" Sway was livid. Memphis stoodnand chuckled as he headed for the kitchen to get another. He didn't evennsee it coming when a pillow, launched from their living room landed with anthud across the kitchen, just missing his head. He knew that Sway couldn'tnget off that couch in less than 5 minutes without help, so he silentlynpicked the pillow up out of the sink and kissed Sway's head as he walked bynand replaced it on the couch beside her on his way out the door. \"Going to Otto's. I'll be back before supper,\" Memphis promised. Memphis stepped off the bus and strolled down the street and intonOtto's shop. Just as if he did it every day, (which as a matter of fact hendid) he walked to the back of the shop and heartily greeted Otto. \"Randall! Good to see you! How's Sway?\" he asked. \"Pregnant. Need I say more?\" said Memphis. Otto chuckled. \"When is she due?\" asked Junie, Otto's wife. \"Three weeks from now, and I wish it were three hours from now,\" saidnMemphis. \"Eager to be a father, are you?\" Junie teased. \"No, Sway's sick of being pregnant and I frankly can't stand tonlisten to her whine anymore.\" Otto and Junie laughed at this. They foundnthe twinkle of sarcasm in his voice and eyes and knew that they were right.n Memphis was going to be a father and he couldn't wait. Sunday of that week rolled around and Randall and Sway were on theirnway to eat lunch with Memphis's mother and her house. Kip would be therentoo, and, if Sway knew their friends, more than one of them would be therentoo. Sway gently smoothed her hands over her swollen belly. She was readynfor this pregnancy to be over with, but still wasn't sure if she was up tonthe task of motherhood. Granted, she was an awesome car thief and an evennbetter mechanic, but she wasn't sure if she would get quite as muchnattention doing a ten-second diaper instead of a ten-second quarter mile.nAt length, she wondered what they would name the baby. They had opted notnto find out what the sex of the baby was, and now it was starting to makenher nervous. \"Honey. Are you okay?\" asked Randall, pulling into his mother'sndriveway. Sway had been right, there were more cars here than they hadnanticipated. Sway vented her concerns and Randall listened, assuring hernthat everything was going to be fine. \"What about a name?\" Sway asked again. \"Well, why don't we let the guys help?\" asked Randall. \"Let them name our baby?\" said Sway, giving her husband a look thatnsent her eyebrow up into her hairline. \"What about Rose?\" said Kip. \"Not Rose,\" said Donny, \"Lindsey or Tracy, but not Rose.\" \"What's wrong with Rose?\" said Kip. \"Boys, boys, try this one.Bernadine,\" said Tumbler. The group ooohednand aaaahhed, remembering the car that the name symbolized. \"Guys, I'm carrying a baby, not a V6,\" said Sway. The guys laughed.nBy the time Memphis and Sway prepared to leave for home, they still didn'tnhave a name for their baby. \"What if it's a boy?\" asked Sway. \"I like Nicholas,\" said Memphis. Sway nodded. \"Maybe Collin or Braeden,\" said Sway, \"Collin and Nicholas come fromnthe same roots.\" \"How do you know that?\" asked Memphis. \"I..well.I kinda been reading one of those baby name books and Infound a really good baby name database on the internet, too.\" Said Sway.nMemphis smiled. About half-way home, Sway doubled over in her seat. \"Honey, what's wrong?\" asked Memphis, suddenly alarmed. \"I think the baby's coming,\" said Sway. Panic swept Memphis's mind.nThey were miles from the nearest hospital. \"What can I do?\" Memphis asked, suddenly not sure what he could do tonhelp her. \"Drive!\" Minutes later, Sway and Memphis were careening down the freeway.nMemphis looked desperately at his wife, wondering if he dared open hisnmouth. \"Honey, how are you doing?\" he asked timidly. \"Unless you can get me to the hospital in less than sixty seconds,nyou're going to have a major problem on your hands, mister,\" Sway panted,nthe pain becoming next to unbearable for the next few seconds and thenneasing off. Hours later, the hospital waiting room was quite a scene. Memphisnwas in the delivery room with Sway, trying not to tell her that she was inndanger of breaking his hands, and their friends, plus Kip and Memphis'snmother, were lined up on the comfy blue chairs and couches. \"Sharon,\" said Donny. \"No, Beverly,\" said Toby. \"Too old-fashioned. Sage sounds better,\" said Kip. On and on itnwent. The longer Sway was in the delivery room, the more names spilled outnin the silence of the waiting room. Soon, a shape appeared in the doorway. It was a man. A man carryingna newborn baby. Behind him came a nurse to make sure the baby remainednsafe. He appeared lost for words. The delicate, tiny life in his handsndrew the group in room to it, as if the itty-bitty fingers had pulled somenmagic string to make them all move. The miraculous little bundle wasnwrapped in pink. \"Brittany,\" \"Vanessa,\" \"Suzy,\" \"Rachael,\" \"No,\" said Memphis, slowly shaking his head, \"Her name is.\" he chokednback paternal tears as he fought to control the tidal wave of love he feltnfor this little creature that he helped to create. \"Her name is Eleanor. Eleanor Helen Raines.\" The silence in the room unraveled the men in the circle, revealingnthe grace created by the miracle of a brand new life. \"Happy birthday, Eleanor,\" Whispered Kip, gently taking the baby fromnhis brother's arms. Slowly, she was passed from person to person, each onentaking their time to memorize every detail of their newest little friend. \"How long did you say it took you to get to the hospital?

She had only one reason for coming to this place and that reason was to visit her sister, whom she'd only kept in contact with through letters. Since their mothers death while on a boost, Sway left for Long Beach while Dallas stayed in Michigan. Both Sway and Dallas had worked with their mother boosting cars. That's how they learned the ropes. Ever since that day, Dallas hadn't stolen one car ever again. Sway, on the other hand, joined a group of boosters. They'd gotten into a lot of trouble and soon, Sway realized the error of her ways and so did Dallas. Unfortunately, Dallas had realized it all too soon and Sway learned after it was too late. Dallas parked her car under a streetlight beside the curb. She got out and walked down the street to the bar where Sway was working. As Dallas entered the bar, it seemed a lot cleaner that what she was used to. From the corner of her eye, she saw Sway leading a man out through the back door. He looked as though he'd had a few too many drinks. Sway cursed as she threw him out. When she returned behind the bar to serve more customers, Dallas was sitting on a bar stool right in front of her. \"I'll have a rum and coke on the rocks, Sway.\" Dallas said. Sway replied, giving Dallas a good look before she began mixing her drink, \"Sure thing.\" Sway slid the drink down the counter to Dallas, who stopped it with her hand and took a drink. Sway was still curious about this woman. She recognized her from somewhere and she knew she would kick herself later for not asking. \"Have I seen you before?\" Dallas paused a moment and regarded Sway. \"My own sister doesn't even remember me.\" She laughed softly and took another swing of her rum and coke. \"Dallas? I don't believe it. You never told me you were coming.\" Sway was taken back a moment as she moved from behind the counter to approach Dallas. \"I think that's what the point of a surprise is, Sway. You weren't supposed to know.\" Dallas moved toward Sway and they embraced. A whole flood of memories came back the moment they came near each other. For so long, they'd been separated. To have Dallas back in her life was a joy to Sway. Sway took a step back and spoke, \"I'm off work in a few minutes. If you don't mind waiting, I can take you to my place. You're not going to stay in a hotel if I can help it. Hell, if you really need to, Memphis and I can spare a room in the house for you.\" \"That would be great. Thank you so much, Sway. How about I go wait in the car and we'll head to your place once you get out?\" Nodding, Sway moved to hug Dallas again. \"Alright. Just don't drive off on me. I'd hate to loose you twice.\" Dallas headed out of the bar and back into her car where she turned on the radio. She didn't mind the wait. Especially because it was her sister she was waiting for. Everything felt different, but familiar at the same time. Sway seemed very happy, not to mention she talked about Memphis. They must have moved into a house together. Her thoughts were jarred when she'd heard a knock on her passenger window. Sway waved and told her to roll down the windows. \"Just follow me. I'm in the white BMW.\" The night drew near and the dimly lit streetlights became bright beacons guiding her way as Dallas followed Sway home. She'd wondered what Sway's home would look like and what cars would be in the driveway. Dallas already knew Eleanor would be there. Sway talked about Eleanor all the time in her letters like it was her baby and not Memphis'. It seemed quite a short drive to Sway's house from the bar. When Dallas pulled into the driveway behind Sway, she immediately noticed Eleanor. She admired the car for moments before getting out of her own Mustang and leaning against the hood. \"She's beautiful. Otto did a good job on it.\" \"He sure did.\" Sway moved to Eleanor. \"I worked on the engine. Otto did the bodywork. I'll tell you more about it later. Right now I have to get you inside and meet everyone. I'm not sure, but Tumbler might be over. He's been coming here a lot since his dad died.\" Dallas followed Sway up the porch stairs and into the home. \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" Her eyes moved around the main corridor. It was a beautiful bungalow home. From inside the den, Dallas could hear a familiar voice over the TV. She heard things like 'I have two dads and one wears lip gloss!' and 'My gender is yet to be determined'. She got closer and saw Memphis sitting on the love seat, while Kip and Tumbler sat on the couch. Tumbler sat watching the TV in awe. \"Jerry Springer again, Tumbler?\" Sway asked rhetorically as she took a seat beside Memphis on the smaller couch. Tumbler smiled and placed the remote he'd been clutching in his hand down on the coffee table. \"Yup. Good old Jerry.\" Kip watched as Dallas took a seat between Tumbler and himself. \"You must be a friend of Sway's?\" \"Actually, I'm her sister. Dallas.\" Memphis responded with enlightenment, \"Sway, you never told me you had a sister.\" \"I wanted it to be a surprise.\" Sway smiled and looked over at Dallas. \"I told her she could stay with us. I know you won't mind, Memphis. She's my sister.\" \"I don't mind at all. I would have liked a little heads up. I don't know if we have room.\" Kip chimed in, \"Dallas can take my room. I can sleep on the couch.\" He thought it would be a good idea to do something nice for Dallas. She was actually quite attractive. It must run in the family. Dallas protested, \"No. I'll sleep on the couch. Kip, you keep your bed.\" She said turning a bit to face him. \"I'm used to sleeping on a couch. I did it all the time back when I was in college.\" \"I insist. Take my bed. I'll take the couch.\" Kip said as he got up from the couch and stretched. Tumbler did the same, sensing it was his time to leave. \"Well, I'm heading home now. It was nice meeting you, Dallas. Hope to see you again sometime.\" Tumbler smiled and walked past her. Dallas smiled back and watched him leave. The group sat in silence for a moment as they flipped through channels on the TV. There was nothing good on at this time, mostly infomercials, Jerry Springer, and re-runs of 'I Love Lucy'. It was already 2:00 AM and Dallas felt like she was going to fall asleep right there beside Kip. She dozed off for a minute; her head lightly leaned against his shoulder. Dallas' eyes opened when she heard Memphis' voice. \"We should probably head to bed. It's late\" \"I second the motion.\" Dallas said as she got up from the couch and offered her hand to Kip. \"Get up. I'm sleeping here.\" Kip ignored her hand, smiled, and flopped down on the couch. \"Go to bed, Dallas.\" \"Alright. You win.\" Dallas turned to Sway. \"Lead the way, oh wise one.\" Sway took her sisters hand and moved through the home briefly before taking her to Kip's room. \"We can take out your luggage in the morning. You should get some rest now.\" Dallas nodded, heading toward the unmade bed and sitting on it. \"Thanks again, Sway.\" She lay back down and kept her eyes open for a few minutes to take in the room. It was messy, which is what Dallas expected from a guy like Kip. His room was filled with stuff about cars. There were many car related posters; small car replicas still in their packaging and on the window to the right of her was a classic decal with a ford boy peeing on a Chevrolet. What a lovely thing to look at before dozing to sleep. She nodded off at first, still trying to examine the room but her eyes were getting heavier and eventually she went to sleep. Kip hoped Dallas wasn't asleep already. He crept past Sway and Memphis' room toward his own where Dallas was. His hand rested on the knob for a brief moment before he turned it and entered the room. He saw his extra pillow by his bedside table and he moved to grab it. \"I'm awake.\" Mumbled Dallas as she turned her head to look at Kip, who was standing to her right. Kip turned quickly, almost as if he'd been snuck up on. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. I just needed to grab my pillow.\" \"You didn't wake me.\" \"Okay. Sorry, again.\" Kip grabbed the pillow and held it against his chest as he spoke, \"Goodnight.\" Dallas watched as Kip moved away. She sat up in bed and called him back. \"Wait, Kip. I feel really bad about making you sleep on the couch. I want you to sleep here.\" She watched as Kip stood there, debating. \"Look, there's enough room for both of us. And it's more comfortable than the couch.\" Moving back toward his bed, Kip sighed. \"You should be a saleswoman.\" He joked as he got into the bed beside Dallas. \"Hey, Dallas?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Thanks.\" \"No problem, Kip.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter Two : Out of Reach Dallas stretched, awaking to the smell of freshly made coffee. She felt like the star of a Maxwell House commercial with the exception of her dancing around from her first sip of coffee. Her eyes scanned the room one last time as she got out of bed and moved out of the room and into the kitchen. Memphis was making pancakes and Sway sat at the kitchen table, sipping her coffee. Both their eyes moved to look over at her, making her presence known. Once Memphis made the pancakes, he organized them neatly onto a plate and placed them in the centre of the table. Sway reached over to the plate of pancakes and picked one up, folding it before taking a bite. \"Morning, Sunshine.\" The words that came past Sway's lips before she continued to eat her pancake. \"Good morning.\" Dallas greeted, taking a seat at the table across from Sway and grabbing one of the pancakes. Just about that time, Kip walked out of the bathroom in a pair of black jeans and a white wife beater tank. As usual, his hair was gelled back. \"Sleep well?\" Sway looked directly at Dallas. A smile spread across her face. She knew that Kip and Dallas had spent the night in the same bed together. She had even been nosey and peeked into the room early in the morning when she woke up. They looked pretty comfortable to her. Dallas grinned back at Sway, a slight glare appearing on her features. \"Yeah. I slept good.\" She leaned back in her chair and finished off the pancake she'd been eating. \"So do we have anything planned for today?\" She glanced over to Kip as he made his way over to Memphis and patted his shoulder. They greeted each other with a good morning and Kip took a seat at the table next to Sway with a cup of coffee. \"Memphis and I promised Otto we'd be in today to work. But I'm sure Kip would be more than happy to show you around Long Beach or something.\" Sway purred, her eyes peering from the rim of her cup of coffee as she took a drink. For a moment, Kip paused and looked over to Sway. Matchmaker, anyone? He blinked and then looked to Dallas. \"Oh, yeah. We can go down to the Harbour front for the car show.\" He smiled and decided not to go for the pancakes today. He wasn't very hungry anyway. \"That sounds great.\" Dallas pulled closer to the table and rested her elbows on it, her hands moving to Sway's cup of coffee as she lifted it to her lips and finished it off. Sway's gaze snapped to Dallas with a glare. My coffee. \"Memphis and I should probably head out now.\" Her gaze would then soften as she looked over her shoulder to Memphis, raising her brows a couple times to give a sort of signal that she'd wanted to leave Kip and Dallas in privacy. Memphis smiled and nodded, heading toward the door. \"Don't forget to wash the dishes tonight, Kip. It's your turn.\" He would yell just before exiting and closing the door behind him. There was a moment of silence after Memphis and Sway left the house. It wasn't an awkward silence as much as it was a peaceful and comfortable silence. But Dallas wasn't a fan of long silence's, so she got up from her seat and walked over to Kip. She picked up his now empty cup, along with hers, and she placed them in the sink. Dallas hadn't noticed, but when she had turned to put the cups in the sink Kip had gotten up from the table and had moved to stand beside her. \"I might as well wash these so I don't have to worry about them later.\" Kip said as he picked up the dish soap and dumped some of it into the sink. Dallas reached over and turned on the water. \"Four hands are better than two.\" Nodding, Kip smiled and carried on washing the dishes with Dallas. Every once in a while catching himself glancing her way and feeling slightly guilty because it was Sway's sister. They had their differences, though. Dallas had long brown hair just past her shoulders. While Sway's hair was blonde. Dallas seemed to like wearing clothing that fit a bit tightly and she liked jeans. Sway liked leather. A soft sigh passed Dallas' lips as she took a step away from the sink and dried her hands on a dishcloth. She looked down at her halter-top to make sure she didn't get any dirt or water on the bright yellow fabric. Her gaze would then wander off to Kip and she caught him looking at her. \"What? Do I have something on my face?\" She joked, sticking her tongue out at him. \"Don't stick your tongue out like that. I might be forced to do something with it.\" Kip joked right back. With the dishes done and everything in the house secure, Kip and Dallas made their way down to the Long Beach Harbour for a car show that happened almost every Friday. Kip's friends were already waiting there when he'd pulled up into one of the parking spaces in his Dodge Charger. Dallas stepped out of the car after Kip did and she made her way around from the passenger's side to see everyone. \"Dallas. This is Freb, Toby, Mirror Man, and the already famously known Tumbler.\" Kips spoke up, watching as Dallas moved up to give each of them a hug. \"Hey. Nice to meet you.\" Dallas gave a wave of her hand in greeting after hugging each of them. She quickly pulled her hair into a ponytail and pushed a few strands to her frame her face. Freb rubbed the back of his neck, looking a little shy. \"So, are we going then?\" They made their way through the other visitors as they examined the various vehicles that were being displayed along the harbour front. Dallas walked in between Tumbler and Kip. While they walked, Kip was reminded of the days when he used to boost cars. Those were good days until he had screwed himself over. Toby had luckily recovered from his gunshot wounds and everyone was glad he did. He had always been the kid who wanted in on the action, but never got the chance to show what he could do for the team. Except for hacking. Kip remembered when he was like Toby. When he wanted to be just like his brother. He'd gotten his wish. \"Sexy.\" Kip's thoughts were broken when he heard Dallas speak and then move from her spot between himself and Tumbler. She moved toward a Mitsubishi Spyder. \"Looks like a V8 in this baby.\" Kip moved to the opposite side of the car. \"You remind me of Sway.\" \"You'd be surprised how many times I've gotten that before.\" Dallas grinned. \"But Sway has more of an obsession with cars than I do.\" The ground moved on to more and more cars as the day went by. Each of them pointing out the shapes, guessing how fast the car would go, arguing about which one looked the best. It was like they were in their own little piece of heaven. And they didn't have to boost them to enjoy them; merely looking at the cars brought back an excitement that a lot of them didn't want to forget. After indulging in the sights of the harbour front car show, the group made their way down to the beach. Instead of lying in the sand, which they knew would get everywhere, the opted for sitting on the grass under a tree. Dallas leaned against the trunk of the tree, pulling grass out of the ground. It was a habit she'd had since she was a kid. \"You know, if you keep pulling out the grass, we're just going to be laying on the dirt.\" Kip said wryly as he lay down with his head resting on her thigh. Dallas merely laughed and threw the grass in his face. Kip shot up and shook his head to get the grass off it. Kip threw a big glob of grass right back to her, but it missed and ended up hitting Tumbler in the shoulder. \"Okay. That's it.\" Tumbler pulled out a wad of grass, plus some dirt, and aimed for Kip. Though he purposely faked it and ended up hitting Mirror Man. Mirror Man brushed himself off. \"Do NOT tell me you just threw that at me!\" Soon, the small grass fight between Kip and Dallas became a full-fledged grass battle between everyone. Kip moved to duck behind Dallas, wrapping his arms around her waist. \"She'd my shield! Shield!\" He yelled, his chin popping up to rest on her shoulder. Dallas looked over to him and grinned, peeling his arms from around her and getting up to run. While Toby had the chance, he hit Kip with a wad of grass. Kip glared. \"I'll get you for that one later.\" Meanwhile, Dallas had stopped running and she was standing in front of the water. Her shoes had filled with sand when she was running through it, but she didn't mind it. She could hear someone approach her from behind but she didn't turn around. Then there was a loud yell as Freb was hit in the eye with grass. The game would cease. Her ears caught Toby saying, \"It's all fun and games till somebody looses and eye.\" Once Kip had caught up to Dallas, he stood beside her quietly. His gaze glanced to the side to see her expression. Just to make sure she wasn't angry or upset. She looked happy. It made him happy. \"Did you have fun?\" He asked in a quiet tone. \"Yeah. Most fun I've had since boosting cars.\" She replied \"You used to boost cars?\" \"Yeah.\" Dallas sighed, blinking as she looked to the water. \"But I gave it up. I didn't want anyone to get hurt anymore. Everything went out of control.\" She would leave it at that for now. Looking over her shoulder, he looked to Kip before her eyes went to the others. \"I think it's time to go home now.\" Kip nodded and watched Dallas turn to leave. He followed after. The day had gone by so quickly and it was already time to go. By the time everyone had said their goodbyes, the streetlights were on and night was starting to come. It was a relatively quite drive home for Dallas and Kip. He couldn't help but think about what Dallas had been talking about a moment ago. She was talking about how things got out of control. Could it have been the same control Memphis had talked to him about before? \"What happened?\" Kip asked, not sure if he wanted to know or if she wanted to talk about it. \"I mean, what happened that made you loose control?\" Dallas looked over to Kip and frowned. She lowered her head; her long ponytail falling forward. \"My mom died.\" Kip was speechless. Dallas continued. \"She crashed her car in a boost. I used to be in her group. She didn't want me to be but she knew she couldn't stop me.\" \"So is that how Sway started?\" \"Yeah. But then she left and tried to start a new life after mom died. You know how that story plays out. She ended up boosting again.\" Dallas' gaze moved to look away from Kip as she stared blankly out the window. \"It's like a drug, Kip. It's so hard to stop.\" \"I know.\" Kip said as he took his hand off the stick shift and placed it on the hand that was resting on her thigh. \"I know what it's like.\" Her brown eyes blinked and then looked to her side. Dallas regarded Kip for a moment as his hand slipped away from hers so he could shift gears. That touch of his hand was more than he could ever do to let her know that he understood and that he really did care. Other than that dialogue they shared, the rest of the car ride was silent. Dallas looked out the window, her reflection looking back at her. She ran a hand through her hair, pushing the strands around her face back behind her ears. A car pulled up beside them at the stoplight. Dallas looked to Kip and gently tapped him on the shoulder. \"Do you know them, Kip?\" Kip looked in the direction Dallas was pointing and immediately saw the man's dark and very familiar face. \"Johnny B.\" Kip mumbled under his breath. \"Johnny who?\" \"Long story. Roll down the window.\" Johnny B smiled and gave them the finger as Dallas rolled the window down. \"Hey Baby. I'm gonna kick yo ass. I just got outta the pen and you and your brotha are gonna pay.\" When his smile widened, gold teeth could be seen in that disgusting mouth of his. \"You go ahead and try it, asshole.\" Kip retorted. At that moment, the light turned green and both cars raced past it. Johnny B was close in first. They whizzed past parked and moving cars, on-coming traffic, and even a few pedestrians. All the while, Dallas was enjoying the rush of speed again. One she hadn't felt in a long time. But in that moment, Dallas also felt a border being passed. If she were driving, she would have felt it sooner. Even she knew when she had to slow down. She eyed the speedometer. \"Kip, you're going too fast.\" \"No, I'm not, Dallas.\" Kip brushed her comment off and sped up more, pushing in the lead. \"Damnit, Kip, slow down!\" Dallas screamed. Out of nowhere, another car drove in; hitting the car Kip and Dallas were in from the left side. Another car hit them in the back, casing it to flip over and roll a couple times before skidding across the road to a stop. Johnny B slammed on the breaks, but that was useless. His car slammed into Kip's, causing Johnny B and his passenger to fly though the windshield. It killed them both instantly. Car crash, east side town The water's deep and you can feel your own strength fading You're beginning to let go It was about 20 minutes later that Dallas woke up. A searing pain passed through her as she slowly turned her head to look beside her. Kip lay next to her, breathing faintly. The car had been turned upside down and all the blood was rushing to her head. She began to feel a bit light headed. A trickle of blood passed down her cheek and toward her eye. She blinked it away and then closed her eyes for a moment. Dallas could hear the ambulance coming closer. But would they be there in time? Her eyes open again as she searched for Kip's hand in the dark. When she does find it, she gave it a squeeze. But he didn't squeeze back. High above me, I can see the surface now Picture perfect life is faded out of you And high above me I can feel the world But I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it I just need you I just need you Dallas kept squeezing his hand, hoping to wake him. \"Wake up. Kip, I know you're still alive. You bastard, wake up.\" She kept talking as tears began to well up in her eyes. She felt like everything she touched died or left her. Her mother. Her sister. Even her father. Though, she really couldn't blame Sway for leaving. It was the best choice. Dallas knew that. And even as the tires of the ambulance could be seen vaguely from the shattered windshield, she thought that this was what it was like for her mother. But she probably didn't feel anything. Not like this. Kip's hand was cold. Dallas was scared. Those tears that welled in her eyes were now streaming down her face as she prayed Kip would be all right. And you grow colder like a dream I can't believe the practical things They're always out of reach Paramedics and police officers gathered around as they began to tear apart the metal wreckage to free the victims inside. One voice sounded so familiar to Dallas. But the face couldn't be seen in her mind at the moment. All Dallas could think about right now was if Kip was going to make it or not. Entwining her fingers in his, she squeezed his hand one last time. Car crash, east side town The waters deep and I can feel my own strength fading I'm beginning to let go Dallas felt no broken bones, just shards of glass scraping against her skin. Feeling light headed, she touched her forehead with her free hand. She was bleeding. Not only there, but on her lip as well. From what she could feel, that was about it. But she knew there had to be more. A soft sigh escaped her lips as she rolled her eyes back into her head. The blood loss was taking its toll on her body. \"They're taking their damn time.\" She mumbled weakly. Her eyes shot open when she felt Kip's hand squeeze back. His head turned slowly and their gaze met with a smile, with whatever strength they both had left. Kip felt her hand loosing its strength. The doors on each side were finally cut open and Dallas was limply pulled out of the car. Kip and Dallas released their grasp on each other. Both were hopeful they would see each other soon. High above me I can feel the surface now Picture perfect life has faded out of you And high above me I can feel the world But I don't need it I don't need it I don't need it I just need you I just need you Detective Castlebeck was the first person on the scene, along with his partner Detective Drycoff. \"What a mess.\" Castlebeck sighed as he moved to the car wreck. He would then make his way to the bodies that had been pulled out of the vehicle. His brow lifted as he recognized one. \"Isn't that Kip Raines?\" asked Jason as he circled the body. Castlebeck replied. \"Affirmative, Drycoff. Check if this car is stolen. We can never be too sure.\" Jason Drycoff nodded and pulled out his radio. \"I'd like a theft check on a licence plate number…\" He trailed off, recognizing the other victim of the crash. \"Something wrong, Detective?\" Came the booming voice of Castlebeck as he stood behind Drycoff. A sombre look passed Dryoff's features as he kneeled down and brushed hair away from Dallas' face. She was unconscious. He was sure this was the girl he'd know four years ago. The one he'd met in college. Sure, they had a thing together, but then she disappeared. To where, he didn't know. Either way, the story between them was unfinished. And he didn't like stories with no ending. \"Nothing, sir. It's just that I know this woman.\" \"Who is she?\" Jason got up as the paramedics took her away on a stretcher into the ambulance. \"She's a friend.\" He was about to step forward, wanting to see her to the hospital, but Castlebeck pulled him back by the arm. \"We have work to do.\" Castlebeck said sternly. Reluctantly, Detective Jason Drycoff stepped back and turned to face Castlebeck. He was ready for the next order. All the while, he wondered what Dallas was doing with Kip. I'll just see her in the hospital tomorrow. He thought to himself before reading out the licence plate number and collecting evidence. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Authors Note: The song is by David Usher and it's called Surfacing.

She walked slowly heading to where the back room was. \"Can I help you?\" a guy asked coming up. \"Yeah, I was wondering if a ummm...Randal Rains was here.\" \"Who?\" the blond haired guy asked. \"Memphis Rains.\" the young woman raised an eyebrow. \"Oh yeah sure, I'll go get him.\" the guy left leaving the young woman to wait. \"Hey Memphis,\" Tumbler said coming in to the back room. \"There's some woman out there to see you.\" \"What?\" Memphis asked. \"Yeah she asked if there was a Randal Rains here and I'm guessing that's you.\" \"What does she look like?\" \"She's got light brown hair and dark brown eyes.\" Memphis was confused as he got up to go see who wanted him. Her back was to him when he walked up to her, she turned around when she heard his footsteps. \"You wanted to see me?\" he asked. She nodded. \"I...ummmm...needed to talk to you.\" Memphis raised an eyebrow. \"About something.\" she twisted the bottom of her shirt. \"Could we go some where?\" \"Look I don't have time for this right now, I don't know what you want...\" \"I need to talk to about something. Can we please go somewhere?\" \"Fine.\" Memphis sighed throwing his hands up in the air. \"I'll be right back.\" \"So what did she want?\" Tumbler asked. \"She wants to talk to me, somewhere other than here.\" Memphis grabbed his keys. (At a little dinner) \"So what was it that you wanted to talk to me about?\" Memphis asked impatiently, he wanted to get away from the is girl. \"It's ...\" she stopped when a waitress came with their food. \"about a car.\" \"A car?\" Memphis raised an eyebrow. \"You brought me here to ask about a car?\" The girl nodded. \"Why?\" \"Because I knew you could help me.\" was all she said and than began to eat. When they were done Memphis sat back and looked at the girl. \"You really brought me all the way here to ask about a car.\" he shook his head laughing lightly. \"Why is that so funny Mem?\" Memphis sat up straight and looked at the girl. \"What did you call me?\" he asked warily. \"I-I-I- I called you Memph.\" \"No you called me Mem. There is only one person I know who called me that. And she's far away from here.\" The girl got up. \"Maybe she's not as far away as you think.\" she emotionlessly, and left. Memphis sat thinking. He got up and left quickly. \"Hey wait up.\" he ran to catch up with the girl. \"Come here I want to show you something.\" Memphis lead her to a roof top. \"What do you see?\" \"Buildings.\" \"No I'm serous.\" Memphis laughed. \"A world were no one can stop you from being who you are. A place to call home., a ...\" \"World unknown.\" Memphis and the girl said together. Than Memphis turned and smiled at her. \"It's been a long time since I've seen you Anddy.\" \"I know.\" she kept looking out over the city.[Chapter 2] 1Disclaimer:nI don't own anything to do with the movie and such, only my stuff \"Wherenhave you been?\" \"Incould ask you the same thing.\" Anddy sighed. Shendid have a point, Memphis had left 2 years after she had. \"Andnwhy are you back?\" \"IfnI tell you will you tell me?\" Memphis asked. \"Depends.\"n Anddy glanced at him. \"On?\" \"IfnI can leave some things out.\" Memphisngot this feeling that something was wrong, but he didn't push it.n\"Ok.\" Anddynsighed. \"I came back to see how everything was going.

Sorry it took so long, I'm working on another story. Anddy stood thinking should she meet every one or not. It couldn't hurt to. Memphis couldn't have met people that were murders, course he could have. Anddy took one look over the city, than turned to Memphis. \"Sure.\" (Garage) \"Come on.\" Memphis walked in to the garage. \"Wait here.\" Memphis walked in to the back, soon he returned. \"They're coming.\" 2 minuets later a bunch of guys walked out from the back. \"Guys I want you to meet someone. This is Andrea Wilkinson.\" Anddy waved. \"Of course you remember Donny,\" Donny tipped his hat. \"Hey Anddy, what up girl.\" \"Spinx,\" Spinx just nodded. \"And Atly.\" Alty smiled. Memphis noticed that Anddy kept staring at Kip, like she'd seen him before. \"Ok the new faces are, my brother Kip.\" Kip stuck his hand out. \"Hi.\" Anddy shook his hand. \"Tumbler,\" Tumbler grinned and winked at Anddy. A smiled was on Anddy's face. \"Toby.\" Anddy shook Toby's hand and as she did she noticed that he was blushing. \"Mirror Man,\" Mirror Man nodded at Anddy. \"Freb,\" Anddy shook his hand. \"Otto and Junie aren't here right now, but you'll meet them later.\" Memphis started walking out side. \"And I wanna show ya something.\" Anddy started to leave when Tumbler asked. \"Hey weren't you like the chick who was faster than Memphis?\" Anddy nodded and than walked out side. She found Memphis looking at something. \"What is it?\" \"This.\" Memphis spread his arms out. Anddy looked at the water. \"Mmh.\" she looked amused. \"What?\" \"Nothing, it's very pretty with the ummm...\" Anddy started laughing. \"fishing boats and ummm...such.\" \"Fine.\" Memphis huffed, turning around. \"Mem, I like it, honest.\" Memphis turned around grinning. \"It really is a site isn't it?\" he laughed. \"Oh yeah.\" Anddy laughed. Memphis and her walked back inside. \"Hey Memphis you got a phone call.\" Atly told him. \"Ok thanks.\" Memphis walked to the back. \"Hey.\" Anddy turned to see Kip walking toward her. \"I got a question for you.\" AA: ok so what ya all think?

Crazed maniacal screams resounded around the walls of the room and threatened to deafen River as more and more Reapers forced their way into the ever shrinking space within the room that held just them and the one single girl that stood before them in front of the sealed metal door and the trapped crew of Serenity. River…..River Tam. A single girl, a human girl but not a normal girl but rather a weapon. Without a conscious thought she swung the weapons in her hands that she had taken from those that she had already taken down, the crazed men and women who no longer could be described as human as their rage induced brains registered not even one blip upon their consciousness, a consciousness that had not registered a single normal emotion since the time that they had become what they now were. They had once had a life each of them but now they had an existence but not a life, controlled, no, they were no longer controlled but that had been what the Alliance had tried to do and as an interference with the human psyche it had backfired so dramatically in a way that none of the Alliance leaders and scientists had ever imagined it could. Reapers, the scourge of the universe. A secret but one not yet known to the universe, a secret which the Alliance would go to the end of the universe and do anything to stop it ever getting out. But as with all secrets, the truth had come out ad was now being broadcasted to the very ends of the universe not that River or the Reapers were aware of at that moment. River was too busy in containing and killing those who were trying their best to kill her so they could get beyond the door to those trapped behind the big steel door behind her, her brother and the rest of her extended family. When she had seen her brother fall when the bullet had hit him it had felt like her world suddenly standing still and her heart itself seemed to almost stop as she saw her brother struggle with the pain of injury and she had known what she had to do, all her life her brother had taken care of her and now it was turn to take care of him. As her mind went into battle mode it was as if she heard herself from a distance speaking when she had stood and they had all heard her say \"My Turn.\" Turning from them and running as swift as an elk and with the elegance of a bird of prey she had dived through the small opening of the steel doors that had jammed when they had tried to close them to keep the Reapers out. Landing and rolling so she was standing within seconds her mind shut down as her body took over, twisting and turning, hitting out with her fists and then weapons as the training she had received at the school took over. Grunts and screams as her fists connected first with one face and then another but none distracted her from her purpose as she swung around and then flew back to where the control for the door was and as the door finally closed she threw the medical satchel through it as the Reapers dragged her back. Once again she turned on them and her training took over as more and more Reapers came at her intent on ripping her apart. For a time it seemed that time stood still as the girl and the Reapers fought, until River alone was all that was standing in the now blood soaked chamber and as the door that had been closed, slowly opened she saw those who she had fought so valiantly for standing, laying and kneeling on the floor staring at her as if she was someone they had never seen before. The looks of shock and disbelief on their faces at both what she had done and the fact that she was standing unarmed before them but also she saw in their eyes the look of relief and love that they all shared for not just her but each other for they truly were of sorts…..a family. A/N: There you have it my first ever story in this fandom though not on fanfic, I hope you liked it and if you did, reviews would be appreciated as I am always a bit concerned when writing for a new fandom more so than when I write for those fandoms that I have other stories in. I do have a number of other one shots which I will eventually get round to posting in this fandom, ranging from silly and fluffy to rather dark ones!

He threatened his crew with is gun and forced them to desecrate the bodies of those who once were his friends, all to carry on a suicide mission. His eyes pierced with anger and pain, he retreat and sought forgiveness in a small white hut, where Shepherd Book stood that very morning. River found him there shortly afterwards and he looked at her with the same eyes he had always had, but, for the first time, she saw direct to his soul, she saw the man who had lost faith, joy, innocence, devotion, arrogance, conviction, peace, all those things he lost that night in Serenity Valley, where his world collapse, all those things that he found and cherish in his crew. He turned his back on River. She looked at him and wondered why, Mal, knowing that she probably already knew it, answer her silent question, he just wanted to say it out loud. Without looking at her, without even turning. He spoke: \"Every human being has the right to defend himself, his family and his home. The home can be people or a ship. Serenity is my home. When I was a soldier, I refused to give up, I defended the right to be free with a conviction as strong as the air we need to breathe, but in Serenity Valley, when I saw the alliance crush our army from the air, I buried my faith, buried my world, then found a home, when I saw that ship, I found a place where I could put my heart and where I would find that freedom. And over time, I formed a family, with longings and dreams of their own, I just wanted to chase the stars and look at them now – he said showing to her the image that was on the shelf, the only personal touch in the home of Shepherd, an image that shows all of them together. Inara wanted to flee, I don't known from what, in time she found peace, but then things changed and she wants to run again, this time from me, from what I represent. For her I am a dark being full of pain and anger incapable of anything else, she says she keeps seeing diferents sides of me and that confuses her a little, but at the end, she seeks something more, something else beyond the cold and darkness in the galaxy and I chase the cold and darkness of the galaxy. Zoe wants to chase little feet through the ship, she wants someone pure and innocent, to see the galaxy with pure eyes. She wants the immortality that comes with a kid, the proof that we existed, that her love with Walsh will leave behind more than a ship, bullets, tiny toys, she wants someone that reminds them. And she has the conviction that it will be so, that the war we fought and lost or rather I lost, she born soldier so she only lost a war, is not big deal for her, big deal for her is her dream. Walsh wants to continue playing with tiny toys and feel the warmth of Zoe's heart on his chest. He asks for nothing more than wake up every day looking at her, as simple as that, is so scared of been responsible for a kid, in his heart he want that with Zoe, but in his mind he thinks is never going to be prepared to be a father. Jayne wants to follow the bright pot full of gold that hides at the end of the rainbow, and in his mind is within reach of his hand if he has enough aim and bullets. Kaylee wants to follow the motor that tunes the rhythm of her heart and wants to have her illusion and to follow it until the end of the time, with more joy than you would believe possible and with more yearning than I will ever have again. Simon, your careless brother, persecutes the conviction of his duty and love for you to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, his conviction that you would have do the same for him if the places were reverse and I have no doubts that If he had to do it again, he would. He follows you like a ship to a lighthouse, he loves his baby sister, but he does not see who can give him peace in his heart. Sheppard wanted to see the galaxy and to know if men were still worthy of the gift of God. And he had is faith set on the fact, that one day I would be returning to the flock, and nearly made me believe it was possible. He was just following his faith. And you, River, you just want to be free, you want to go back to being who you were before the lab, before Serenity. Before us and someday you will, because your eyes see everything without falsehoods, without secrets. You just follow your instincts. And me? I want to give my heart, my ship to a woman that I know I don't deserve. I want you to see my home as hers but you she doesn't want to see me. My home is not enough. I lost a war and I couldn't handle it. Since I can't give any of them their dreams, I will fight to grant yours... I'll let Inara decide if my heart is valuable enough to give it a shot because it's hers until it stops beating maybe even after. I can't help Zoe to convince Walsh to have a child, they have to work it out by themselves. Jayne, well he is easy, he will keep searching for that bright pot full of gold till the end of his days. I can't encourage Simon to give Kaylee an opportunity, he has to be able to see it by himself, sometimes I wonder if he is really smart because only an idiot will let someone like Kaylee pass by. So, cause I am unable to give them what they want, I'll follow you, I'll make sure that you have your freedom. You didn't ask for any of this and you don't deserve it, I give you my word that you will have your freedom, even if it cost me all the air in my lungs and the engine of Serenity.\" During his speech he didn't turn to look at River, and when he finish he simply kept silent, never saw the radio in River's hands or the fact that during his monologue the radio was on...

She senses it there and so it is the first place she goes when Mal lets them all back onto Serenity. It is the first place Kaylee goes, too, even though no manner of oiling and ratcheting and stroking will make the thrusters grow back. River understands anyway. Some things that don't matter do matter. Some actions we go through because it's important that we go through them, not because they'll do any good. It's the same reason the first place Zoë goes is the cockpit. Kaylee runs her rough hands over the cold surfaces of the engine and coos reassurances. She is so busy comforting her Serenity, her girl, that she does not much notice River in the back corner of the room, lying flat on the floor with her cheek against it and her arm stuck up to the shoulder in a crevice by the wall. She stirs her hand about in the unseen darkness, looking for what she can feel is there. The voice of the captain rattles through the dilapidated ship's corridors, calling them into the old meeting place of the kitchen. Kaylee lingers, and whispers a last apology to Serenity, and then moves to the next room. River stays, not making a noise, just stirring about, seeing with her fingers. It must have tumbled back through the corridors at the crash. She knows it's close… Maybe a little to the left… After a minute or so, the captain's voice calls out again. \"River!\" \"Coming,\" she calls back. She reaches a bit more to the left and… there. The tips of her fingers catch it and drag it into grabbing range. She pulls it out through the crevice and runs in to the meeting, hiding it in the folds of her skirt. Simon is searching for his scattered medicines when she goes after the next one. The latch on the door of the surgery came open in their catastrophic landing, and the precious contents of the shelves and counters ended up all over the corridor outside. When she too goes on hands and knees, she knows he assumes she is helping him search. She does not disabuse him of the notion. They have voices. Voices small but familiar, whispering in the corners of the ship. There is one here, wedged behind a little cluster of pipes, and she snakes her slender hand in among the forest of them. It is there, waiting for her, and she pulls it out and clutches it to her chest. Simon looks up. \"Did you find some of the medicine?\" She covers her find with the splay of her fingers and shakes her head at him. \"Medicine, but not for the body. Not for the knitting of wounds or the filtering of fluids. Medicine for the deep, medicine that lasts.\" \"So… Not mine.\" \"No.\" He nods and she steals softly away. She comes into the kitchen listening for the next one. Jayne is there, rooting through drawers and hiding from Mal who wants him to lift heavy things. He shoots her a wary look, but she sees in his mind its perfunctory nature and is unconcerned. She is now in the categories of \"people dangerous to people dangerous to us,\" which is an approximation of companionability, and \"even more dangerous than me,\" which is an approximation of respect. This is satisfactory. She returns his glance and goes about her business as he goes about his. The chairs that have always sat around the table are in a splintered pile in the corner. The table, on second glance, is too. She bends and reaches into the pile. She pulls out chairs, and half chairs, and chair legs, and here it is, hiding among the broken wood. Her fingers are full of splinters, but she does not mind because her latest find has joined the others and they are humming in contentment in her pockets. Mal comes into the kitchen and barks at Jayne to come help him lift the heavy things Jayne had been avoiding. Jayne grumbles but follows. Putting the ship together. Reachieving serenity. River wraps her hands around the treasures in her pocket. She is doing her part. It gets easier to find them as she goes. She can hear the ones in her pockets calling to the others in that familiar voice. They need each other the way the way any family needs each other. The last one is in the cockpit. Zoë is there. She has been helping out, of course, fighting on stoically like any good soldier, but she keeps finding ways to come back here. So River thinks it's only right for her to wait for Zoë's convenience. She is in the corner, slowly straightening some inconsequential thing, her back to the console. Simon and Mal removed the chair's skewer along with its occupant before anything else was done, but the chair itself remains, smelling slightly sour, stuffing erupting from the hole through its middle like blood from a wound. When Zoë is facing away from the console, River knows, she is trying to imagine the chair without the hole and the sour smell. River stretches her arm into a dark corner and lays her hand unerringly on the last piece. A family again. She stands in front of the console and lines them up, just as they were, just as they should be. Zoë Washburne spins around with a start at the tap on her shoulder. She calms her expression into a strong face, a soldier face, but does not wipe away the tears standing in her eyes. There is no shame in them. River lifts her right hand and places in it the last piece—a plastic dinosaur, a stegosaurus, dusty but still proud. Zoë stares down at it for a moment, and then a small smile curves on her face. She looks over at the console, all of the figures in a row, and then back at River. \"Thank you,\" she says quietly. She walks over and sets the stegosaurus down under a plastic palm tree. River smiles. ","Summary":" She finds one under a floor panel in the engine room.

She stepped back with a huff, making a face at Emma to share her annoyance. The little girl smiled at the silly face her mother made but remained still and quiet like a good baby. Zoe glanced at the Captain's sleeping face and didn't bother to hold back a wry chuckle, this phenomenon of Mal's was something the whole crew found much entertainment in. How the man was able to be fully asleep while reclining and holding Emma to his chest with one large hand fanned out over her small back and the other cupping her bottom to hold her up in a unmovable grip was beyond them all. She remembered the first time they had caught the captain at it, Zoe had panicked and swooped to scoop her child out of, what she assumed to be, a feeble hold. It was an irrational fear because Zoe knew that Mal was able to sleep in the middle of a gunfight holding his rifle in a equally unbreakable grasp. But a rifle was not her child so she had grabbed for her baby only to find that she could not pull Emma out of the Captain's arms. In her panic she tried to forcefully pull Emma into her arms... and Mal had followed. The man was stubborn even while asleep! Zoe ended up having to let go of Emma because her pulling only served to keep lifting Mal's back off the back of the couch when he refused to let her daughter go. The Captain was not the most graceful of men and all her pulling jerked Mal awake just as he fell back onto the couch with a grunt. Startled to find Zoe hovering far closer than he was comfortable with, apparently watching him sleep, he had flailed around comically for a bit, sputtering half coherent protests. Little Emma had remained snuggled safely in his arms while he wriggled around the entire time. The ruckus had drawn the rest of the crew to them and, to the captain's chagrin, it had quickly become their new favorite game: see who can pry a awake, but placid Emma, away from the sleeping Captains arms without waking him. So far they had all been unsuccessful. Zoe straightened as she debated giving up and waking the captain in order to release her daughter, however it was not in her nature to admit defeat and sleep was something the captain always needed more of so she was loathe to wake him. Just then Emma smiled her gummiest grin at something behind her mother and Zoe turned to find River stepping into the bridge, a fragrant cup of steaming hot coffee in her hand. Zoe's stomach growled, reminding her that she was missing breakfast. River glaced at Zoe, \"You're doing it wrong,\" she whispered, mirth thick in her voice as she headed toward Emma and the captain. Immediately little Emma let out a happy peal of baby laughter, clearly excited, she knew quiet time was almost over. Glancing between the two girls Zoe raised a skeptical but amused eyebrow, \"Is that so? By all means then,\" she encouraged. Big eyes sparkling River stopped on the other side of the Captain's seat and passed the cup of coffee slowly past his face on her way to set it on the console in front of him. Mal's nose twitched right away and his nostrils flared as his head turned to follow the scent instinctively. No longer skeptical but no less entertained Zoe watched the younger woman wriggle her slim fingers between Emma's tiny back and Mal's hand. His fingers automatically curled around Rivers hand, it never failed to make her smile sweetly and her pale thumb swept a graceful path across his rough knuckles indulgently. Zoe pressed her lips together to hold back the amused snort threatening the back of her throat at the way River paused to stare at Mal, eyes soft and warm, clearly lost in her own head. She had to visibly struggle to bring herself back to the task at hand. Zoe almost rolled her eyes good naturedly as River finally looked up at Zoe, a faint blush stained her pale cheeks but her chin lifted entirely unrepentant. River looked pointedly at Zoe instead, silently telling her to get ready, and then easily pulled Mal's hand away from Emma's back. It was cake for Zoe to tip her daughter out of the hand supporting her swaddled bottom into her own arms. Finally freed Emma gurgled happily now that quiet time was over making both women smile warmly at the infant. Zoe laughed quietly at River triumphant face, \"I win,\" she joked, making Zoe laugh harder before thanking River on her way out to get her daughter and herself a late breakfast. She had just stepped through the doorway when Rivers own laughter rang out, a quick glance behind her showed her the cause. Mal had woken up after all and had tumbled River into his lap making a show of jostling her around and rubbing his scratchy morning beard into her neck purely to tickle River into laughing and continue squirming in his lap. Zoe turned her back to the couples canoodling antics and made sure to close the bridge door behind her, preserving their privacy for a time. As she made her way down the stairs toward the kitchen she spoke to her daughter, \"Seems we will have to find our own way to get you out of the Captains clutches little one, Aunt Rivers way only works for her I'm thinking.\" Emma agreed energetically, happy to keep chatting away in her in her burbling baby talk.

Set post-Serenity. Also a slight nod towards Dead Like Me. A/N: Written for Rare Pair Fest for mm8 and inspired by their prompts: 'Being with her is like flying. Being with her is like being with Serenity herself,' and 'He isn't sure how to be with River.' Thanks for the prompts and for giving me the opportunity to write these two beautiful and complicated characters. I hope you like! Mysterious yet reassuring. That was what River was, yet that wasn't all she was. No one word could describe River Tam, two couldn't even begin to cover it. For too long he had placed every member of his crew under the obligatory one or two word category. Kaylee was bubbly, Zoe loyal, Jayne hotheaded, Inara elegant yet confusing... rarely the words had changed throughout the years. At first he labeled River as just crazy and that was that, and she was, sorta crazy anyway, but she was also smart and determined, stubborn and a force to be reckoned with. Mal had come to the point of respecting her and even caring about her like he did the rest of his crew. Yet it wasn't just that, was it? He was drawn to River as fiercely and as surely as if she were a part of him and not just Serenity. River could steer her confidently into the great unknown, yet where exactly was she steering Mal? Towards self-destruction and insanity, towards caring so deeply about someone other than himself that he didn't know where he ended and they began? When he walked in and saw her sitting in that chair... gorrammit, he must have fallen in love right then and there. Getting into relationships tended to complicate things, that was one of the very many reasons why he hadn't gotten involved with Inara. He had explicitly told Zoe not to marry Wash for the sole reason that they couldn't afford entanglements, and she had gone behind his back at that. Letting Simon and River Tam remain aboard Serenity was more than just complicated though, it proved a dangerous mix. Yet they belonged there, as sure as they all did. They were misfits, better together than apart. It had taken him too long to realize it, but River was really and truly a good fit, a perfect one if he dared go that far. Malcolm Reynolds did not like things getting complicated, nor did he enjoy how confused he felt when River was around. She was in that chair nearly every time he came in, gazing out into the blackness, legs drawn up and arms wrapped around them. It wasn't a vulnerable pose though, it looked more than anything like she belonged there. They had lost a good man and Wash would never be forgotten, but maybe River was worthy enough to take his place. She looked up when he entered and smiled, an unashamed smile expressing that she had some great big secret to hide. Most days he still doubted River's newfound sanity, but she looked harmless enough and he decided to just go with that. \"How's the sky lookin,' little girl?\" \"See for yourself.\" She playfully kicked the chair across from hers and he found himself sitting down. She always did this, encouraging him to stay when she had to know it made him uncomfortable. It was a source of amusement for her, no doubt; he had no idea what she had to gain by it. \"Sky seems clear,\" he nods in approval, though for what he doesn't know. When he looks back at River she's no longer looking at him, just at the dashboard, as if she's concentrating hard on something. \"Anything on your mind?\" Her head lifted again, \"Same as what's on yours, Captain.\" Mal hated when she called him that, she said it like it was a joke almost, another secret that made her feel clever and him incompetent and in the dark. Asking what she meant by that would only be playing her game, and her games were often tiring and led nowhere. \"It'll be past your bedtime soon, reckon I'll take over for a while.\" He and River were rarely joined up here, sometimes by Zoe but the occasions were few and far between and Jayne, Kaylee, Inara and Simon never visited. It was their place, and Mal would be up here more often than not, drawn to River for reasons unknown. He was way out of his depth here, and that was an understatement. Mal didn't know why those spoken words came to his mouth so easily, as some defense mechanism that he would never admit to. It was easier, her not being around, but he also hated it. When she wasn't around or when he didn't know where she was it was as if Serenity wouldn't fly properly, it was like there was some missing gear that made both her and him function. The captain didn't know why those words made her get up more readily than usual, all too ready to leave Mal to it, whatever it was. He opened his mouth to tell her she didn't have to leave so soon, that he had only just gotten there, full well knowing she would be in the same seat, where she was more often than in her own bunk, but he closed it just as quickly when she stepped towards the door but didn't open it, only locked it. He gulped and pushed himself backward into the chair slightly. Scared of a little girl, how weak and powerless was he? It wasn't that he was scared of her though, he had never really been scared of her, even when she had slashed Jayne for no plausible gorram reason. He was more scared of how much he could be bended before he broke. He wasn't sexually attracted to River, per say, though he suspected he probably could be given time and ample private gazing, it was much more than that. Just as Serenity was a part of him, River was too. She knew him inside and out and no one knew him like that. It was chilling and disturbing, but it was like he could feel her fingers wrap around his heart, her whispered words in his head like a manta not even she understood. It was gut feeling most of the time, pure instinct for every word and every movement involving her in some way. River was never in the background and in her mind, neither was he. She walked closer until she was standing before him, bare legs brushing the chair he sat in, legs that looked so gorram appealing and it was her own fault, for making him feel insane, like she had passed all of it onto him without him even realizing it, for wearing that short skirt that Kaylee had dared given her. The girl who he absolutely could not, should not, would not get involved with was barefoot again, he had warned her about this many a time. There were too many obvious reasons: she could slice up her feet, get bitten by something nasty, stub her toe. But really, everything about her drove him downright crazy, even her bare feet. Especially her bare feet. River pushed herself forward and then she was on top of him, before he could count to ten and exhale, before he could think up any gorram reasons to recoil or even to push her away. His hands went up, but they weren't meant to push her off of him or even to surrender. He put his hands on her bare arms and she straddled him more confidently, sitting down in his lap, legs stretched out to both sides of her like some sort of acrobat and it took his breath away, how beautiful she looked and felt: his hands on her arms, her sweet breath mingling with his own panicky half-pants, her soft hair tickling his nose. She smiled and it transformed in mere seconds: a knowing grin, a hand held up to brush her hair back but Mal did it for her, practically moaning on his next exhale when she pressed her forehead against his own. He instigated the first kiss, one on her cheek to test the waters a bit, but she pulled away and kissed him full on the mouth, tongue moving with heated purpose inside his mouth and he followed suit. She tasted even more amazing than she smelled. He jumped, jarring against her when he realized what he was doing. He couldn't do this, couldn't make out with Simon's sister, couldn't fall in love with someone younger than him. She was still a kid... but nothing felt more sure than when she was pushed up against him, making his existence seem a little more important. \"The door's locked, Mal,\" she reminded him with a soft smile. How could she do this, make him feel wanted? He tried to remember if she had ever called him Mal before. He liked it. His hands were trembling again, grasping onto her arms tightly as if she would leave, as if she would call this all a trial run or even just a game, a play period for her to chill out and not think about her choices for a while. \"You're a good kisser.\" When had she gotten this snarky? When he looked at her, into her eyes, he could swear that he could see Serenity, as if River was the physical manifestation of her. She was here, holding him together, steering them into the perilous sky safely, steering them all into safer waters and in her own way, steering Mal carefully into her own head and heart. It felt like he had been with her for ages and just never knew it; it felt like he had known her for centuries. Being with her was like flying . Flying without knowing where the hell you were going but feeling sure about it anyway, safe because someone was there guiding you. Flying with wings as wide as the universe and as bright as the sun. She was blinding. He smiled, \"I reckon you're a pretty good kisser yourself.\" Their next kiss lasted for as long as they needed it to.

In the corner of the engine room, trying to stay out of her way, stood the impeccably dressed Dr. Simon Tam.

No light humor to highlight her day, no one to lovingly talk to as they settled down to go to bed. All she could do was blindly follow Mal's orders to keep from facing the morose, morbid truth. No more blond hair to play with. No husband. Just her. Wash was gone. Everyone kept looking at her for a reaction, but she remained strong. She had to. Even though there was a cold, empty space in her bed, she could not act empty. Getting out of bed seemed like the hardest thing for Zoe, because the residual crew was waiting for her to react to the events. She had nothing to say. But Zoe knew it was only a matter of time. Zoe slipped out of her stone-cold bed and slid on her shoes. She had expected a kiss on the cheek as she fumbled with the laces, but received only the disappointment of something that would never come. Zoe climbed up her bunk ladder, anticipating the ruling she would face for acting completely sober. Crew were talking in the kitchen, she could hear the murmurs from her bunk. She began to make her way to the kitchen, boots on her feet making an echo throughout Serenity. Zoe entered the kitchen, and the crew; Mal, Simon, and Jayne began to get quieter. Zoe stood there, behind the counter, getting the little she needed for breakfast. Tears still stood in her eyes. Stagnant, not moving. Like him. \"How do you think she's taking it?\" Simon asked Mal. The young doctor ran his fingers through his jet black hair. He looked up. The brightness from the kitchen lights hurt his eyes. They were always too bright. Having conversations in the kitchen always felt like you were in some sort of spotlight. He preferred the infirmary. \"Same as she takes everything.\" Mal answered, \"As it comes.\" Mal was thinking of not how in the 'verse they would repair Serenity, but how he could repair his crew. \"I don't know Mal\" Jayne said, joining their discussion. \"I keep thinkin' about Booke, and I ain't never gonna forget him for a while.\" \"Everyone's shaken up, Jayne.\" Mal said. \"It's just a matter of getting back on our feet.\" Zoe went up to the bridge to think. She pushed her brown hair from her staid face. Does everyone hurt as much as I do? She didn't know the answer. And she didn't care to ask. The bridge was still a mess. Fragments of glass punctured her skin as she reached something that looked like Wash's dinosaurs. She pulled out his Tyrannosaurus Rex and his Stegosaurus. Wash had always told her that the T-rex was his favorite because it was vicious, a carnivore, but Zoe always knew his gentle Stegosaurus was his favorite. Zoe clutched the plastic dinosaurs to her chest. Tears pricked her eyes until they fell without obstruction. Zoe heard heavy footsteps coming her way, metal thumps growing louder. She wiped her tears away as fast as she could, because she was strong. She wasn't going to fall apart. Mal sat himself in the passenger seat and looked up at Zoe. \"How are you fairing?\" he asked. Zoe's hands bled from the scratches from the glass. \"I'm fine\" she lied. \"How is the rest of the crew?\" Mal blinked. Clearly Zoe wasn't fine. She was holding back. He knew it. \"Zoe,\" Mal began reluctantly. \"Everyone on the boat is feeling the same pain you are. Heck, I can't imagine losing a husband, but I can imagine losing a great pilot, and it hurts all to hell. Don't think you haven't done your fair share of crying, because believe me when I tell you, I cried like a baby last night.\" Mal gave his signature smile that made everything seem better. Seem. Zoe smiled at his remark as a single tear began to slide down her cheek. She reached to wipe it away, but Mal gently took her wrist. \"It's okay\" he said. More began to steam down her cheeks, as she grasped the dinosaurs tighter. Mal looked down. He hated when Zoe cried. He was protective of everyone in the crew like a father. \"Thank you\" Zoe said quietly. Mal touched her shoulder. \"Of course\" he said. Mal walked away with the same metal thumps as when he came. That was just what Zoe had needed. Shattered glass cracked under her heavy boots. She looked at the dinosaurs once again. Small, plastic eyes stared back at her. Her finger traced over the details of the plastic dinosaurs. Zoe smiled under the tears. She had two pieces of Wash. She wasn't empty anymore.

Wash knew this was a suicide mission and yet he still went along with it, the whole damned thing. He made the call to Mr Universe, Hell he was even sat at the helm of the ship now, cruising along with next to no power, his heart rapidly beating as he saw the mass army of Reavers that he was cruising threw as if they were no threat. He was scared, he was pretty sure they all were, but all of them could prepare for the worst, they could all prepare to be boarded with their shiny guns and their seemingly endless bullet supply whilst he had to sit pretty at the helm, steering the damned thing, and that's what frightened him. He had nothing but his wife to protect him there, and if anyone or anything should harm her, he wouldn't know what to do; she was, indeed, his everything, his one worldly possession that he couldn't bear to lose, not now or ever. He watched as one of the Reaver ships began to follow them, his eyes closely scowering it, waiting to give the order, and as its claws crept out, he found himself shouting the word \"Now!\" down the intercom at Mal, who had been waiting on top of the ship with the gun they had attached earlier that day. As Mal shot at the Reaver ship, some little inkling in Wash's body confirmed that now was a perfect time to start running towards the Alliance, considering now they had an entire Reaver fleet on their tail. He sped off ahead of them, straight for the Ion cloud without a moment's hesitation. The quicker they got away from the Reavers the happier and calmer he would be. He wanted his wife out of harm's way more than himself, his love for her ran deeper than his fear of the Reavers and that was worth something, even out in the black. The crew, and his wife, came before him, even his Captain came first, simply because he was a worrier, and was happiest when everyone was safe, even if he wasn't quite safe himself, like the time with Niska. He never knew he could get so angry about anything that was happening to Mal, but he did. His vessel sped through the cloud, like there was nothing there at all, not even the pretty flashing lights that Mr Universe had promised them, and out the other side, to be greeted by none only than the Alliance fleet Wash had been expecting. But he headed towards them like nothing was wrong, but of course, everything was wrong, they were running from a fleet of Reavers, only a slight chance of survival right into an Alliance fleet, and that was something Wash never thought would happen, it had been completely improbable. He saw the main Alliance cruiser right in the middle of the windshield, not caring to alter course no matter how close he was getting to it, not until the Reavers were out of the Ion cloud and not until he was close enough to spit on it, before diving underneath the base of it, dodging all the missiles that were heading his way, even those from the Alliance. \"I'm a leaf on the wind… watch how I soar.\" He muttered before turning to dive through a gap in the battling ships, unaware of the Reaver ship that was still on his tail. There was a loud clunk on the side of the ship as some debris from the fighting smashed into Serenity, Wash felt the yoke try to pull away under his hands but he wouldn't let it, his eyes fixated in front of him at his goal. \"It's okay! I'm a leaf on the wind!\" He pulled hard on the wheel, pulling it away from another hurtling piece of debris, heading straight for the planet below them, right to where they needed to be, and they were one step closer to getting to Mr Universe. \"Yes… Yes!\" He shouted at Mal as he dodged another piece of debris, and straight into the middle of the firing zone, trying to lose the Reaver ship that was closely behind them, watching as the lazers shot past him after breaching atmo. The second laser hit one of Serenity's engines, Wash beginning to panic as he felt his control disappate.[b] \"We're fried, I've got no control.\"[/b] Serenity began to spin at a sickening rate, Wash scrambling to press as many buttons as he could to at least boot up the back up in time for him to be able to make a crash landing. He knew it was no good when his wife told him that the backup read at twenty percent, there was no way he would be able to land Serenity properly, he was just going to have to risk it all and land her properly. Shaking his head in defeat he gulped hard before finally speaking. \"I'm gonna have to glide her in.\" He ignored everything, his brain completely shutting off from everything everyone was saying, so that he could concentrate on gliding her into the bay below, which was coming up way too fast for his liking. His face strained as he pulled hard on the yoke, pressing a couple of buttons to release the landing gear, the ship shuddering underneath him with the strain of the pull. He knew that the gravity from the planet below was ten times heavier than the pull that came from himself, a small yet semi-muscular man. He knew it had been pointless as soon as he started tugging, but he had to try, for the crew's sake, he had to think of some amazing stunt he could pull just to keep them all alive when they landed. That's when it happened, the bottom of Serenity landed with a loud smack and a screech as it tried to stop the ship from bouncing all the way down the runway, Wash's hands flying off the wheel, feeling his body lift from the chair, and smash straight back down into it, knowing that he would be bruised an achy once the ship had come to a halt. According to his calculations, wouldn't be too long now as he saw the end of the runway approaching them fast, with no signs of stopping, no matter how hard he pulled on the brakes. One of the engines caught on a piece of scaffolding, ripping it straight off and sending the entire ship spinning out of control down the runway. Panic ran through every bone in Wash's body, unable to find the strength to pull himself from his chair and grab hold of the wheel again, as if there was some unknown force holding him back. He needed to do something, he couldn't just sit there and do nothing, considering he didn't really even know what was at the end of the runway, and he didn't know how everyone was from the crash landing either. It didn't matter though, he found out soon enough where the runway ended as the back end of the ship slipped off it, and down into an entrance, enough so that the door of the craft could still open and let everyone out, an easy escape for them all. He'd done it, without even really doing a thing, he felt a sudden relief inside as he realised he'd managed to get everyone down and safe on the ground, even if the landing wasn't exactly how they had planned it, but then again, he hadn't expected to have been continuously followed by that Reaver. All the lights when out in the cockpit, a red glow coming from all the warning bulbs in the area, and Wash sat there with a slight smile of relief on his face, thankful that his wife, his captain, and the crew were safely on the ground, with no casualties. He looked back at his wife, before looking before him; back out into the runway, feeling slightly more at ease as he couldn't see the Reaver craft anywhere, hoping that by some miracle he'd lost it on his way down. \"I'm a leaf on the wind… watch how I-\" those were the last words he ever spoke as the Reaver ship, shot a large wooden harpoon right through him. But he didn't die, not right then, not even with the amount of pain soaring through him, the will was too strong to die, the will to hear his wife's voice just one last time before his life was ended. He heard her call his name that one last time, the fear and panic ringing in her voice. He so desperately didn't want to leave her, but the will of living, and the tug of death were no match…he felt his life slip away. Wash shot up from his bed with a cry of \"Juh Shi Suh Mo Go Dohng Shee?\" , sweat dripping from his face, his hand clutched to his chest where the harpoon had previously been. He looked down at his hand, looking around to see his beautiful wife, laid asleep next to him, worn out from their previous day of hard work and even harder play. He had to admit that dream had felt painfully real, the whole thing of it, and he still had the pain in his chest, a duller version of what he had experienced in the dream. He sighed quietly, slipping himself out of the bed, looking back towards Zoe as he slipped some boxers on. She never looked as good to him as she did now, sleeping ever so peacefully, a smile stretched across her face, unaware of the night terror he'd just experienced. He didn't need to trouble her with such things, not right now, not when she looked so happy. He wasn't going to spoil that, not for all the bribery in the world, not even if she stood up right now and let the quilt fall from her naked body, no, especially not even if she did that. He slipped on a clean shirt and pair of pants, tucking them into his boots, as if he was getting ready for another working day, but he knew that the rest of the ship would still be asleep, and by the time the rest of them woke up, they would find a relatively exhausted Wash at the helm, and even though he couldn't even think of going back to sleep, he knew he would later from exhaustion, whether he liked the idea or not. He trundled over to the ladders leading up to the rest of the ship, only looking back as he heard his wife stir slightly, but he hoped that she would not wake. He climbed up, his boots clanging on every step, his whole body cringing at every sound knowing that if anyone heard him, they would be less than impressed at him waking them up in the middle of the night. Wrapping his big warm jumper around him, he shuffled as silently as he could past Kaylee's quarters and up into the cock pit, his eyes taking in the beautiful sight the fell over Serenity. He'd never really taken the time to appreciate the stars as a pilot, not as much as he had wanted too, but that was because he would normally be asleep right now, but as he stood there, he took in the whole sight ever little bright light woven onto the silky blackness of space. It's design intrigued him now, slowly taking his mind off the dream he had, had not quarter of an hour ago, simply for the simplicity of it all. It made him picture a life where everything was simple, where there were no complications and nobody to tell him what to do, and no Reavers trying to kill him. There, he'd done it again, he'd reminded himself of the dream he had had and he cringed at the thought, slightly annoyed at himself, but scared all the same, like he should have been when he dreamt. He shouldn't have let his guard down; he should have got up and moved out of the cock pit as quickly as he could instead of praising himself for something. It was sloppy and unprofessional of him, and from previous experiences he should have known better than to hesitate in a moment like that. Sighing, he slumped down heavily into his pilots chair, leaning on the dashboard and looking out into the night sky, his brows furrowed as he tried to take his mind of the dream again, but it was no use, he really had done it this time, he'd royally messed up by reminding himself of the god damn Reavers. \"Meh, tah mah duh hwoon dahn\" he muttered under his breath, slamming his fist on the dash in annoyance, his dinosaurs bouncing up off it just as Serenity had done down the runway of Mr Universe's. Hearing the small chink as one of them fell over, he stared at it for a moment, contemplating what to do next about his little situation. There wasn't much he could do about a dream, not really, not when there wasn't anyone worth talking about it to, except his wife, who, was all warm and tucked up in bed where he would have been if his mind hadn't decided to take a little trip down death lane. His dreams had always been so full of life, so happy, and he couldn't understand why this once he'd had a night terror, and for a moment, he feared that it might happen again. Yet, that was all it was, a night terror, it was never exactly ever going to come true, not in a million years, hell he couldn't even remember why they'd wandered into Reaver territory in the first place, it wasn't like he was having premonitions, that was River's job. He was just the pilot, not a damned psychic, and that's the way he liked it; he liked being behind the wheel, steering the ship to the next job and hopefully getting paid most of the time, and even when they didn't, he'd just fly them off to the next place. He picked up the small figurine T-rex in his hand, scowling at it slightly as if he was examining it, but he wasn't, he was merely contemplating why he'd kept the toys in the first place. Were they there as a distraction? A symbol of his childish side? He didn't even remember why he'd brought them on board in the first place, but as long as he was in here, and they were on the dash, he couldn't resist the temptation, like a child who had been told not to press the big shiny red button. He picked up the other figurine from the dash and turned towards the radar, a dinosaur held in either hand as he bit his lip, trying to think of something witty to say. Shaking the stegosaurus in his hand he whispered [b]\"I was betrayed once, but never again shall I fall into the hands of a vicious lizard such as this one over here.\"[/b] His eyes twitched over to the T-Rex held in his other hand, [b]\"but I am a kind, and gentle creature.\"[/b] He hissed quietly, before looking back over at the other dinosaur. \"Ahh well then my friend, you can help me rule over all this land!\" the stegosaurus cried, bouncing along the radar as if there was nothing wrong with approaching his impending doom. As the Stegosaurus came closer to the T-rex, Wash laughed evilly under his breath before forcing the T-rex up onto the Stego, and began to make munching noises as if it was being eaten, as if flesh was being ripped off the other dinosaur for the T-Rex's dinner. Growling lowly under his breath as he chucked the stegosaurus to once side, he let out a pretend burp, and chuckled evilly. He didn't know why, but for some reason, this whole dinosaur eating dinosaur thing had always been somewhat of a comfort to him, as well as a boredom killer. They were the only real material things he had besides his large Hawaiian shirt collection, and his wife, whom, he was bound to by God, and but soul. He truly did love her, and no matter what other woman tried to get in the way of that, he always found he had the strength to say no to it. There was something about the curvaceous warrior woman that Wash knew he would never get bored of. He smiled, leaning back in his chair as he thought about the magnificent naked woman lying back in his bed, keeping it all warm for him should he even think of returning to it before they all had to rise again for work. He pictured the sheets folding beautifully over her to reveal all her curves, folding over the area between her back and her legs that he always loved. The thought of those powerful shapely legs that she had just made his smile widen even more, like nothing in the world was wrong. He reminisced about why he'd married her, even though they hadn't exactly gotten off on the right foot, considering, he could tell from the moment he met her that she had a slight disliking for him, but he'd changed that, rather well actually and for that he was proud. He'd even shaven off his mustache for her even though he thought it made him look particularly manly, but she had a high loathing for it. It was strange what a man would do for a woman, who would potentially never fall in love with him, but she had, and for that, he was eternally grateful.

Tears fell from her eyes; there was a deep ache in her chest. It was a sadness that would always remain; it cut so deep it was hard to breath. It was so strong it nearly overwhelmed her. There was no way she could keep it back. To force it back down and to pretend it wasn't there. Thoughts came flooding back, the look on his face when trying to tell her that the bible didn't need to be fixed, there was nothing wrong. It was faith. The confusion that ran through her and then the guilt that she had ruined something of his, something precious. Just because no one understood her, didn't mean that she didn't understand them. River had tried to apologise but couldn't find the words, then she saw that hair. It still gave her nightmares even now. A sad smile graced her face; he tried so hard to help her and to understand her. Even after all the things she had done he was the first to go and try to help. River knew why, she could read his mind. It was guilt of the things he had seen and done, things that he should have stopped but never did. Horrors that kept him awake at night looking for redemption and Book believed he had started that road when he had first stepped foot on Serenity and met this merry band of thieves and fugitives. She missed his stories, his preaching. Serenity was that little bit emptier without his laughter to lighten it, her tears moistening the sand around the stone. \"Faith.\" River whispered as she kissed it and curled up trying to feel close to him just for a moment longer, the bible clutched tightly to her heart.

In memory, the moment after the doors opened was endless. She raised her weapon, expecting them to pour through the door, and first noticed that they didn't. She recognised River, standing in the doorframe. Unhurt. She had a vague awareness that Alliance troops entered after that, but, somehow, memory edited that out and she moved slowly, silently into the room in the same endless moment. The room was so full of the dead, there seemed to be no room for the living. During the war she had come upon a shelter, hit by a bunker-buster during a raid. There was not a single body within the bunker, but the place was covered in human remains. Just no recognisable bodies. The room was worse, somehow. She seemed distant from it even as she walked through it, as if she was seeing everything through a pane of glass. The place was covered in bodies, left where they fell. Many had wounds to the chest, face, or arms, and had probably died attempting to fight. Others perhaps had been caught by surprise, looking the wrong way, expecting an attack from the wrong angle. Some of the fresher wounds, on the bodies of the last to die… they had been running, or hiding. They had finally encountered something so terrible, it overcame even their condition and so they had tried to escape. Not that it did them any good. The bunker had suffered an impersonal event, like a volcano erupting or an engine exploding. The room had witnessed a massacre. A mass execution, not a battle. There was hardly a body there with more than a single injury. Almost every one had been simply, efficiently, artistically , been given a solitary, lethal, blow. River stood easily, unafraid, almost obscured by big, armoured, heavily armed, clearly capable, nervous soldiers. She had never seen axes quite like those that River still held. They must have come from the rooms other, now-peaceful inhabitants. She wondered if River had ever used or even touched an edged weapon before entering this room, and she shivered. Behind her, Kaylee retched. ","Summary":" Endless Moment No one ever remembers an event quite as it happened.

Not the drinks, those were flowing freely. They were on round three already, bubbles forming in their minds, clouds slowly settling and making all thoughts mellow. Jayne was drunk, not on alcohol; he needed at least a couple more of the hard liquor to get there. He was drunk on happiness. Same as the lady sharing the booth with him… Honestly, kicking Reavers asses is getting to become a habit, and a seriously exhilarating one at that. Mal and Kaylee are out and about buying the parts they need to fix his baby. She did pull her weight and the battle was largely won on the skills of Zoe and the versatility and resilience of Serenity. More than respect, it's reverence that the crew needs to show to that ship because she makes one hell of a last line of defense. \"To Serenity!\" Jayne bellows. \"To Serenity\" chuckles Inara. She doesn't know for Jayne but she is already getting a little tipsy. Happy though. They've traveled with fear for so long that seeing the light at the end of the tunnel is just overwhelming. Winning again felt good, it was giving everyone a slight hope that those badass Browncoats had survived for a purpose; there was a chance to real happiness out there for them. Inara sputtered a bit, trying to choke down that last glass proved hazardous to her health. Still, she smiled, the burn was invigorating, there simply was no way to cap the joy inside her. Things had been better with Mal. Zoe had found the courage to continue without Wash, the gaping hole he left in their lives replaced by happy memories and discussions about the good times, the pranks, the memorable fights. Today, each of them was at a different place in their lives, more trusting of each other, more open in their friendship, better trained at defending themselves, smarter in their scheming. The bar started to fill up; more drifters mingling with the tired locals, desperation dripping from the orders yelled at the bartender. Jayne and Inara looked way too cheerful, the newcomers were eager to reach that stage too. Business will be rocking tonight. \"One more, Nara?\" \"I told you, I'd keep up with you big boy, fill it up!\" she ordered the big man. Not that she wasn't used to having her way with the manly men she hangs out with, between her training and her adventures with the guys, the question was could she out drink the biggest and baddest of them all? Probably not. But she will give it her best, that's a certainty. She tipped the glass on the side, tried to right it up, decided to bring it up to her mouth, ended lowering her face to the table to sip the sloshing liquid, not bothering with a toast anymore. Jayne was laughing, getting drunk was definitely on his list of enjoyable activities, perverting the lovely Inara to his beloved past-time was just an added bonus worth remembering. If only he could be sure to remember this… He knew in his heart of hearts that he will. After all, for years he'd hoped to spend some time with the girl his Captain had set his eyes on. She was pretty, she was kind, and she was quiet. The quietness was what really made him notice her. He could have pretty girls, once in a blue moon he could afford a companion, but he probably never could have a person that understands him and can provide the peace he needs between outbursts. He wouldn't want to play kinky games like some of the men she meets in her line of work. This is not about spanking or silk cuffs… it is about finding a safe harbor. Sadly, this port has already been spoken for. And… he remembers the old song his mom used to sing \"you can't make a heart love somebody\", yes, he surely can't… but he will build memories and commit to his mind this moment as probably one of the happiest in his life. \"Are you sure you want to experience round five, sweetie?\" \"Jayne, I'll kick your ass, if you even start with the condescending tone.\" She was giggling and he was cherishing every minute of it. An evening he will never mistake for the bar drawls Mal and Zoe attracts, an evening made for simple pleasures and dreams, an evening worth writing about to Mama. The end.

This is fanficiton author Lightning4022. Just a quick word- this is a character account from a Serenity roleplay game I am currently doing. It is obviously written as this character, Josephine Ashe, and her writing and views do not reflect my own. There's a bit more information on her profile, if you're interested! Enjoy. Journal 1- A Journey in Jiangyin Authors Note: Our first big mission just got done, and its been about to weeks or so since it all started but I havent gotten to much time to write anythin. Well, cept for a couple a poems that i wrote on the trip. Anywhosits, it started when Janet, the dispatcer at Tracinia Couriers, told us about the son of some fancy alliance guy who got put in jail for stealin money or somethin. Shed herd that this son had taken his dads stuff and moved out in the rim to Jiangyin while he figgred out what to do with it all. She said if we found all o the great riches he was keepin, we'd be so much closr to our dream of havin our very own ship! No more of this half-wages Couriers nonsense. She gives us a little shipment to pick up outta Jiangyin. Carly gets all superstiches or somethin though, coz mercy's talkin all about some ghost named horhay on the ship, coz little bits of jewelery n food n whatnot keep disappearin all over the boat, n sometimes we hear little scratchin noises from the walls. Carly makes us search all round the wearhouse until we find this lil piggie doozzybob made outta glass. She says it's some sort a good luck charm n we get to leave. So me, Kass, Mercy, n Carly all set out, me pilotin of course, and we know the trip'll take a few days. i get to spend most of the first day up on the bridge, just lookin at how pretty n dark space is. I get a coupla insperations for some real nice poetry, but nothin comes to the page when i try to write. I hear mercy goofin' off a little, but nothin's out of place. Then, they call me down to the kitchen n tell me that we're catchin whatever little thing's been makin all these distractions on the boat. Carly makes me go to sleep, and that damn autopilot has to fly for me for a few hours. i didn't sleep well, too worried about the ship crashin into a moon or somethin, and i wake up real early in the mornin to this rattlin noise from the kitchen. Pretty soon it turns to screechin n hollerin, and everybody's up. Turns out that critter on board was some kinda monkey! Mercy calms him down, and they make me put the guy in our bathroom for the night. Since I'm already awake, Carly lets me go back to pilotin. I write this about our adventures so far: Pitter pat above our head Kass'll set a trap Mercy won't let the critter be dead But maybe it's a rat! Actually it's somethin funky… Horhay, the spider monkey! Nobody likes my poem all to much when i read it, but i think it really captures the adventure we had. After a couple more days of flyin, we land on the dusty lil planet. We get on our mules, but after a while I notice this HUGE rattlesnake. It wasn't a problem for me, and i killed it in one shot! Kass wanted to stop and cook it up, and we had our first real meal in a while. Even i thought it was delicious! While we were eatin, this guy shows up, named Jessie, an we get to talkin about the local goings on. He's a little freaked out by kass and my twins thing, never gets old. oh, and kass and i started bringin along these matching jackets and doin our hair and pants and boots the same way, but wearin different shirts. so we can look like the same person if we need to. not that we dont already! But Jessie doesnt know too much about any of this alliance guys son business, but he says we should talk to Marsha the marshall in town about these raider guys botherin his town. he eats some rattlesnake and leaves. We meet marsha, who doesnt know anythin about the alliance guy but that aparrently theres some new settlers town at the turner place, which doesnt mean anythin to us yet. she says that the raiders around here are keepin her saloon from gettin the drinks they order, so we go talk to the saloon guy. when drive back to the boat. but when we get there, tho, there's this raider guy who tells us to get away from our own boat! carly tells us to leave, n we turn around n go over the next hill. then we make our plan to get our boat back. first, i sneak back up to them with my shotgun, n then everybody else goes while it's clear. the raiders are makin so much noise that they dont even hear my loud sisters! then, we start shootin, and kass gets one guy with her wrench. carly gets shot though and after we shoot one guy and the others run away, we have to take her back to town to get stitched up. while she's gettin fixed, mercy, kass, n i fly to the town with the saloon drinks. we get our money, most of it gets paid to the doctor after he fixes carly, and go back to the saloon. (my memorys a little fuzzy here) carly's still a bit woozy from her operashen but we know about this tracker guy named bret who could help us find this alliance guy while were here. we stay the night in town and go to the gun shop, and the next day carly n mercy talk to bret at the saloon. he says he can help us if we pay him right, but we still need to go get our real shipment n take it back to Persephone. we tell him well hopefuly be back, n head home. Janet getsus another shipment real close to Jiangyin, on Ita, and well have some time to go after the alliance guys stuff too. were not sure if we wanna do it yet though, because the shipment looks real suspishes. and we dont know about the alliance guy either, he could have some real strong people workin for him, maybe even the raiders! and we dont know what hed even have. we take the shipment though and start flyin for a few more days. on the second day, we get the scare of our lives! outta the middle of nowhere, this lil ship flies at us, trailin smoke out the back. i know its reavers, but how did they get out here! this aint reaver space! they almost hit us, n we could have died, but yours truly saved us with this tilty-flyey thing that i did, and they miss us. they try to follow us, but were too fast! i wrote this about it after it happened: Flyin high Above the sky Reavers! Oh no well surely die! But Jo, she sure does know how to fly! The best pilot ever, by and by! Carly helped me with the by and by part. i needed something to rhyme. mercy said my poem was awful. :( Anyways, we decide to go back to Jiangyin and figger out the deal with this alliance guy. we meet bret again, and he says that theyre at the turner place that marsha told us about! one of their big guys is even at the brothel now! we go get horses and go past the brothel to see the guys horse n check if hes still there. mercy notices that hes got a robot horse, and i see this big pretty shotgun! we dont want to take it tho because it might have some sorta alarm n we dont want him to know what were doing. we ride for a few hours in the countryside and bret knows where hes going. we say if he helps us fight n sticks with us that we can give him a lift to Persephone, but he leaves after we get safely to the turner place. when we get there, we se a huge military ship, but it probably had alarms on it so we couldnt do anything. thats where they probly had all their supplies too. we saw a man and a lady outside waitin for their guy at the brothel to come home, but he doesnt show up so they go back inside. we go around to the back of their house and wait for a few hours, figurin out what to do. we think maybe we can go in there n pretend to be sick travelers, but mercy could pull somethin. and we dont want to fight them for sure! we dont even know what their deal is yet. eventually carly tells us to go back to town, and well talk to their other guy there. we get back real late at night, and the alliance guys sons brothel guy is in the saloon havin a drink. carly n mercy talk to him, n aparrently his name's Gordon but people call him grunt. mercy says hes a good guy (one of her speshal things she can do is tell things about a person. almost like shes readin a book), and he gets up to get some air. i follow him (kass n i were on the other side of the room by the bar so he doesnt notice me) he calls up his boss, probably the alliance guy, about how theyve found the people that can ship for him. he notices me outside the bar, and goes inside. i follow him in, and so does kass. hes real surprised by the twin thing, and asks kass if she was just inside, and how she got to the table so quickly. then i show up. hes real surprised! he explains to us that the alliance guys son actually took his dads stuff and wanted to donate it to the orphanage on Persephone, but he couldnt get off the planet because his dads ship is bein tracked. we offer to help him, and take the four people in their group to Persephone. its a good thing we didnt fight or lie to them! we get ther stuff on our boat and take em with us, but we dont have enough room for bret. we pay bret, and the eight of us leave Jiangyin. Its kinda cramped but we manage to pick up our real shipment and head back to Persephone. fortuneately our company didnt seem to wonder why weve been taking so long to ship everything (thank you janet) and the company we were getting from didnt actually ship anything bad . they took the stuff to the orphanage, and since they donated all of their money, they gave us the robot horse to thank us. we sold it, and it put us even closer to getting our dream. some day. and in the meantime, we sure know how to make workin on that boat fun! a little adventure, lots o time with the best sisters in the Verse (well, not too much time. i can always get my space on the bridge when i need) and our new pet horhay! he dont like me too much yet after i put him in the bathroom, but hes warming up. oh, and i think carly might kinda like grunt! anyways, this was one of the most exciting times of my life.

The night (it was always night in space) Serenity flew to Miranda and fought battles of one kind and another Serenity flew like a wild thing and Wash said \"I am a leaf on the wind- watch how I soar\" but then he died and didn't say anything. That night on the bridge a forest grew and grew— and grew until the ship was filled with ferns and ginkgos and palms and the walls became the world around, blown with a soft Jurassic breeze And there was a private spaceship just for Wash and he sailed off through sun and moon and in and out of stars and almost over a light year to This Land where the dinosaurs are. And when he came to This Land where the dinosaurs are the T-rex roared its terrible roar and the allosaurus gnashed its terrible teeth And they rolled their reptilian eyes and the raptors showed their terrible claws till Wash said \"qing zuo\" and tamed them with a sweet and funny joke delivered in perfect near deadpan without cracking once and they were tickled and called him the greatest dinosaur of all and made him king of all dinosaurs. \"And now,\" cried Wash, \"let's play\" \"Hao le\" Wash said and watched the dinosaurs go off to bed their scales more real than plastic. And Wash the king of all the dinosaurs was lonely and wanted to be where Zoë loved him best of all. Then from far away across the 'Verse, he missed his autumn flower so he gave up being king of where the dinosaurs are.

There's not a day they never fight. Struggling is a word well known on their vocabulary. Yes, Shepherd Book and Wash were gone, but Captain Malcolm Reynolds still has a crew of six to lead; he's not the kind of person who stops to feel, he knows he has to move on. He's responsible for each one and their actions. He still has a ship to pilot. He still has to escape from the Alliance and being free is his greatest achievement, the fight he keeps winning and conquering every day, truthful to his values and ideals of liberty. Malcolm hangs on to the something that keeps him carrying on. He lost friends; he lost human lives, human beings. For more insensitive he may seem he cares about people, especially his crew. Every day is a fight for the tomorrow. Every hour, every minute, every second counts. Every decision taken, whether right or wrong, true or false, can determinate the life or death. Mal have been in a lot of fights, some he won, some others he lost, but he knows that when comes a new day, new challenges come with it, and he always learnt to fight for what he believes, either fighting in the true corporal meaning of the word or by resistance, until the last day of his life, against the Alliance and his enemies. There's always a need to live, a new day to face, new challenges to overcome and goals to reach. If the leader falls, everyone falls. Since little kid the sense of leadership had been on him. And, over the years, that became a harder burden to carry. He has to lead six people. Six human lives placed on his hands. People just like everyone else…people who laugh, smile, cry, hurt and bleed…people who love, hate, feel, breath, fight... People just like him. He never gave up on fighting, he may, however, have tried to flee some fights…But, if people call him ruthless for killing, they are the really unfeeling people. Malcolm never killed anyone without making them look into his eyes. He never killed an unarmed man... but when he did it, it was a merciful action on its true word meaning. Malcolm never really knew what drives him, what makes him fight for the tomorrow. Maybe thirst of revenge, freedom, or maybe to just be the outlaw. He never really found what's so strong inside him that pulls him. Maybe it's love, maybe it's hatred… Maybe is everything, maybe is nothing. But whatever it is, it's strong as hell. And that he does not fight, even if he wanted. It comes from the inside and wraps him before he notices. It pulses along every heartbeat, runs through his veins, fills every breath of his. But it's what makes him take a deep sigh and rest. It's what makes him be assured that he is a normal human being with something that drives him. It's what makes him awake up every time a rush of feelings or events drowns him and feel alive. When asked about what probably drives Captain Malcolm Reynolds, his crew would answer things like these: Kaylee : \"What moves Capt'n is love. He loves everyone on this crew, even though he doesn't show it…\" She would say with cleaning the oil from her hand to an old and ragged piece of cloth, ignoring the stains that she may have on the face. Simon : \"Well, that's a…tough question…\" He'd sigh. \"I think something besides the cardiac system that keeps him alive…\" Clumsy as usual, Doctor Simon Tam would say it on this ways, probably walking back and/or dropping whatever was on his hands at the moment. Zoe : \"I think what drives Captain is the feral posture of a military that fought for his beliefs.\" Calm and strict would be how she would present her explanation. If Wash was still among them, he'd say something like this: \"That self-centered jackass has something inside besides the guts?\" He'd joke. Characteristic of him, expected of him, better saying. Jayne would be cleaning a gun, excitedly. \"What moves him moves every man with a gun: the rude pleasure of shooting!\" But, to not look bad as the old man he used to be, the old Jayne mercenary, he'd add. \"Shoot against some...things…that are not moving…and breathing beings…\" Inara : \"What drives someone is always an emotion. Good or bad, it makes people follow something, chose paths. Sometimes it's a life ambition. But, since we're talking about Mal, I don't think this applies.\" If there is anything the Companion is, is being secure of her words and she's never be afraid to let them flow like this. River : \"The existence of a spiritual part on people has never been proved. It doesn't seem to be palpable or to have significance on the chemical reactions sent by your brain. Nothing impulses living beings than outside stimulus that triggers a response.\" The little genius would answer this without even blinking, unaware of the wisdom and knowledge that her words could sometimes carry. No one seemed to have the right answer. What then moves Mal to keep fighting every day? The one that got it almost correctly was Shepherd Book : \" I don't care what you believe in, just believe in it. \" That's what gives Malcolm the impetus to fight for the tomorrow: living day after day, one day at the time…until the end of his life. And just keep believing, just waiting for the tomorrow to come, for as much time as possible. Can I get some of your opinions? P.S: If you liked this one, I've wrote a small one-shot for Firefly, under the name Serenity, if you guys want to check it...

His head, plastered with short brownish hair, hung as he stared at the ground, and the regularly handsome business suit he donned wrinkled slightly. \"Alright, Raines. If that's your attitude, you're fired ,\" his superior informed him. Shaking his head disappointedly, he added, \"Seems a shame though. You're one of the best. Have your belongings out in thirty minutes.\" He walked over to Randall's office door but halted, looking towards the dealership's entryway, where a man with greyish-white hair stood. The potential customer looked around, seeming thoroughly confused and as though he didn't belong. \"I've got an idea, Raines. See that senior there? He doesn't know the first damn thing about cars… if you can get him to purchase a car for $1000 over the actual price, you keep your job.\" Randall Raines rose his head slightly, and instantly recognized the new arrival. His eyes flared, a fire spurted in them, and, angrily, he shouted, \"You cheap-ass son of a bitch!\" The glass walls of Randall's office shook, attracting the potential customer 's attention. \"You're scum, asshole! You can't fire me – I quit !\" With that, he shoved his possessions into a box, pushed passed his former boss, and walked over to the man who'd arrived a couple minutes before. \"What do you want, old man?\" \"Well, that's an inviting way to treat an old friend, Memphis. What was that little hissyfit about, anyway?\" Raines shook his head, \"Nothing, I just quit. The cheap son of a bitch wanted me to cheat you, and he thought that you, of all people, knew nothing about cars.\" He motioned for them to go outdoors, which they did, the sun now beaming down on them. \"So, Otto, why the visit?\" Otto Halliwell leaned up against a black Mini Cooper and replied, \"You know Kip misses you, kid. He really wants to see you; he's still taking Helen's death fairly hard, although it was over a year ago…\" Memphis bowed his head in respect for his deceased mother. \"Is that all you wanted? You could've just called.\" \"Actually, I promised Kip I'd make you go back,\" snapped Otto. \"You're damn saucy today. And hey… seeing as you just quit your job… would you like a place at the repair shop? We could use more help.\" Randall sighed. \"I guess I could work for you. Does Kip actually miss me? Because he seemed so eager to get rid of me last time.\" Ignoring the last two sentences, the elder grinned. \"Thanks, Memphis. And we'd best get going.\" Me : I know, really short, but chapter one's up! And please review! Anyways, I gotta go post Chapter One, so…. Buh-byes! And review! Everyone : Buh-byes![Chapter 2] Resurrection Me : Hi again! Like I said, Chapter One's up. That's why you're not allowed to doubt me, oki? Now, I'm hoping to have the second and third chapters up before Christmas, but I won't put up chapter two unless I get at least 10 reviews, okay? And Chapter Three requires a total of twenty-five reviews. Oki? Now, enjoy! Chapter One Rocky Reunion Later that evening, closing in on six o'clock, tension began filled Otto's Auto, a vehicle body shop, as the namesake for the company arrived with Randall Raines. Sara Wayland, who'd been sitting on a wheeled board just on the floor, her back leaning against the bumper of a beat-up, dull 1993 Honda Civic, had been casually conversing with one of her male co-workers when she laid eyes on Memphis. She considered him for a moment, her eyes subconsciously scanning him from head to foot, before she rolled herself back under the vehicle. All was uncomfortable silent until – \"Memphis!\" From the back of the room where he'd been sitting came a male in his early twenties. The bottoms of his garage suit glided mere millimeters above the concrete floor, the sleeves rolled up to mid-forearms, the overall suit splattered here and there with paint, oil, and grease. Just visible around the edge of his sleeves was a tattoo on his arm. His dark, slicked back hair would have visibly been wavy if the young man hadn't yanked it back into a small ponytail, away from his brown eyes. Kipling Raines pulled his brother into an affectionate hug, their height evidently identical, and didn't release him until Raines senior physically – but gently – pushed him away. Memphis smiled, holding his sibling at an arm's length, examining him. \"Kip, you look great! How've you been? Getting along fine?\" There was a secret glimmer in his eyes that, if read correctly, would tell anybody he was content. Kip returned the grin. \"I'm good, man – great actually. Otto's been helping me out, a fair bit, so has Donny.\" The elder shot a look of appreciation towards Otto and then Donny Astricky, the above-average-sized African American man Sara'd been chatting with before. Otto shrugged, as though it wasn't a big deal, but with Memphis it clearly was. \"Hey, Donny, how've you been?\" inquired the recently returned adult. The addressee simply replied, \"Alright.\" The man was dressed all in black – black T-shirt, black casual pants – and his trademark, black, wide-brimmed hat was situated alongside him. Donny may have looked sinister to some, but those who knew him even a little knew of his abundant kindness and gentleness. He seemed to be a silhouette against the white sheet that protected the elderly couch where he was seated. Memphis took a moment to observe the comfortable surroundings. The walls were hidden inch for inch behind pictures of the most expensive cars, trucks, and motorcycles, along with diagrams of different vehicles' organs – engines, carburetors, radiators, and the like. Cans of differing liquids were stacked on the metal shelves and a couple desks laden with papers and computers were located against the walls. About a dozen vehicles, a couple of which were up on jacks, were in for maintenance or restoration. Memphis sighed deeply. Home sweet home. \"Come 'ere!\" Kip shouted suddenly. A figure down by where the young Raines had previously been jumped, surprised. The person rose from his computer chair, from which he'd been searching the internet, astonishingly not on a car website. Noticing the signal from his friend to come greet Memphis, the short, delicate figure – only about 5'5\" – rushed over, his Hawaiian T-shirt swaying slightly, his jeans creasing. An uncharacteristic baseball cap covered the chestnut brown hair on the eighteen-year-old's head, but Memphis recognized him immediately. Toby. \"Hello Memphis,\" he said, repositioning his hat so the beak faced backwards. Toby offered him his hand and received a generous handshake. The elder Raines smiled. \"What are you doing on the computer?\" Sensing the hidden suspicion in his sibling's voice, Kip defended his little friend. \"He gonna go to university , man! He's researching to see where he'll go.\" He clapped a callused hand on the teenager's shoulder, and Toby grinned. \"Oh,\" was Memphis's reply. \"Sorry, I… uh… didn't know.\" A snicker came form somewhere close by. Randall looked around blindly until he regarded Sara, who'd emerged from beneath the Civic, and was still on the board, her hand rummaging through a toolbox. \"Well, I suppose that's what happens when you desert your past.\" \"Oh, and you didn't leave your past behind?\" he snapped. She sighed calmly, willing herself to remain under control. \"No, actually.\" Her hand escaped the peacock toolbox with a stainless steel wrench and slid herself back the vehicle. She continued talking, despite her voice now being somewhat muffled. \"If you'd paid any attention whatsoever to me you'd remember that I always called Kip's house two or three times a week, Otto's once a week, and the garage every week and a half. And I wasn't to busy to come back for a couple of days for Toby's graduation.\" Kip nudged Otto in the side with his elbow and whispered, \"She got hit on by nearly all the guys in Toby's graduating class, and a couple of girls, too.\" All of the sudden, the door swung open and the scents of cheese, tomato paste, and charred pepperoni wafted in. Memphis whirled around on his heels to see a dark-haired dude Kip's age enter, three stacked pizza boxes raised above his head. Down the side of his off-white short-sleeved shirt was a clear substance that looked to have the texture of slime, and just below that, on his barely baggy jeans, were several spots of dirt. He rested the cardboard boxes on a nearby desk, then looks over at Otto, frustration evident. \"Otto, man, your dog jumped me!\" was all he said before grabbing a napkin and attempting to wipe the slobber from his shirt but failing horribly while everybody laughed at him. Randall thought back, and couldn't remember seeing Otto's mastiff outside when he'd arrived. The new person proceeded to separate and open the pizza containers. \"Okay people, who's hungry? We've got Pepperoni and Cheese, Meat Lovers, and, of course, a vegetarian.\" Memphis smiled as he greeted him. \"Hello Freb. So I guess all you can do is order pizzas?\" Laughter consumed the garage before the 'pizzaman', grinning, shrugged and replied, \"Hey, people gotta eat, right?\" Donny announced that he was going to check on the Halliwells' dog, snatched a piece of pepperoni and cheese pizza, and passed Memphis as the latter strolled in the Honda Civic's direction, frowning. He looked down and all he could see protruding from under the vehicle were her legs, covered by navy fabric, slightly spread-eagle. He seated himself on his shins, taking her ankles and hauling her out from underneath the vehicle; he felt so comfortable, sitting there almost between Sara's legs, her lying on her back before him, chest rising and falling as breathed. \"You hungry, Sway?\" he inquired, referring to her by her nickname. She jumped to her feet and shoved him backwards slightly. The girl placed her hands on the dark bonnet, back facing Randall, and when he placed his hand on her shoulder and gripped it lovingly, she raised one of her hands and her middle finger stood alone, erect. A lot of ooh s filled the air and Freb, who didn't quite get it, said, \"Hey, where's the love?\" Sway swirled around on the heels of her leather boots, her arms folded, and leaned her back against the Civic. Spite and anger were clearly evident in her now harsh voice as she faced Freb and responded. \"Apparently in some chick's panties, right Raines?\" A crude silence came over the group, everybody watching Memphis eagerly to see what he would do. After a minute, he stepped forward towards the female and nearly shouted, \"Come on, that's entirely unfair! I never did anything with her!\" She accepted his challenge by stepping up as well. There was a severely evident height difference, as she was only Toby's height, nearly half a foot shorter than her ex-boyfriend. \"Oh,\" she growled sarcastically, \"I'm sorry, I never realized that taking shots from a girl's bellybutton was called 'doing nothing'.\" She turned to walk away, but was abruptly stopped. Memphis took hold of her wrist and pleaded, \"Sway, please, wait.\" Upon reaction to being restrained, she took her free hand and slapped him hard across the face before wrenching her other from his grasp. She strode over to the couch where Toby and Kip were now situated and eating pizza, and sat next to the elder of the two. Kip wiped one of his hands on the navy overalls and placed his arm across her shoulders. Sara grinned playfully and laughed. Randall was shocked, but took this opportunity to admire her radiant beauty. Her short, blonde hair was mostly held back, except for a few strands which framed her elegant face. The top half of her work suit was around her waist, as its sleeves were tied there, and she wore a formfitting, slightly revealing black spaghetti-strapped shirt. As she laughed, his eyes were drawn magnetically to her full, red lips. Kipling whispered something into her ear, which was pierced by earrings shaped like little steering wheels. Sway glanced at Memphis and laughed again. Randall seated himself atop a stool and began questioning the female. \"So, are you dating anybody?\" She smiled and answered, \"Uh-huh.\" With that answer, Randall wondered as to whom it could possibly be – whom would Sway even consider dating? As he involuntarily observed her, it came to him – Kip. It was so obvious, he should have seen it coming from a mile away – she'd always cared about Kip, even if it wasn't in that sense, and the two had been known, before she and Memphis packed up and left town, to sit up for hours into the night, just talking. And the reason Kip wanted his brother to come back was so that he could gloat that he got the one woman Memphis cared about so much, but lost. Glaring, he asked, \"What's his name?\" \"Why all the questions, Memphis?\" inquired the younger brother suspiciously. \"Oh, I see. You still love Sway and you're jealous.\" The room filled with laughter, though it originated only from the younger generation. Both Memphis and Sway glared at Kip, whereas Halliwell didn't will himself to blink. Randall cleared his throat and continued. \"Is he good to you? Is he here?\" As though on cue, there was a masculine holler of pain, several booming barks, and a thud against a wall that seemed to be just outside, not five feet from them. Sway jumped up quicker than a Mustang and bolted towards the entrance; Kip rose as well, and when he passed his brother in his walk to follow the female, said, \"He's here now.\" Toby leaned forward on the couch, looking ominous, like somebody about to speak of something forbidden. \"The dude's an asshole, Memphis, but Sway's too stubborn. He objectifies her, I've seen it, but she's in love – or so she says – and won't listen to reason. And she refuses to listen to any of us, even Kip and Otto.\" Memphis looked over at the elderly man, who just nodded affirmatively. Just as Memphis arose, Sway's scolding voice drafted in. \"Down, boy! Down!\" Donny walked in, laughing his head off and clutching his side, with Kip right behind him, doing the same thing. Both held up their hands innocently when they saw Memphis's look . \"Don't thank us, man, thank Otto's puppy,\" was all the African-American said, causing the elder to jump up, startled, and run outside to check on his 'baby'. As Kip reclaimed his place on the couch, he turned to Freb, still laughing, and managed to utter, \"Man, it seems you're not the only one he jumped.\" Following them was a man in his mid-thirties, massaging his neck, and Sway, holding his hand and smooching him on the cheek. Memphis glared at the newcomer and became sick to his stomach. Sway's boyfriend was around 5'8\" and fairly scrawny, although still seemingly strong, with short brown hair and bright, emerald green eyes. He sat on a desk with Sway behind him, her legs wrapped around his waist, wiping the dirt off his jeans-covered legs. The boyfriend caught the glare from Memphis. \"What's wrong, buddy?\" Randall crossed his arms. \"Who are you?\" It took every ounce of restraint within him not to add 'asshole'. Sway jumped off the defensively. \"Watch it. His name's Derek, and I love him.\" Derek slid off the desk and stood in front of his 'girlfriend'. \"What are you doing, honey?\" \"Stay outta the way, Sara,\" he ordered and Memphis's eyes flared angrily. \"Who are you buddy?\" The elder Raines stepped forward, challengingly. \"Raines,\" he informed him, \"Memphis Raines. And dude –\" he motioned towards the female \"– don't boss her around, or I'll beat the living daylights out of you.\" \"Oh, so you want to fight then?\" inquired Derek. He threw his blue sports jacket backwards and Wayland caught it. \"Come on buddy!\" Randall looked over towards Sway, who had tossed the jacket onto the desk. She hung her head, her eyes overshadowed by strands of blonde. He watched her lips - across them rolled the words \"Macho jerks\", although she voiced nothing. Memphis stared at them, those luscious, full, deep red lips, and he could almost taste them. \"No,\" he said, and Sway's head jolted up, appreciation written across her features. \"I won't sink to your level.\" Sway's boyfriend simply laughed, saying, \"What a pussy.\" Memphis shook his head and, keeping the image of Sara's lips in his mind, corrected the unwelcome visitor through gritted teeth. \"No, I just respect the wishes of Miss Wayland.\" \"Bullshit!\" yelled Derek. \"You don't respect her, you just want to screw her!\" At that, he plowed his fist through Memphis's gut. Kip, Donny, and Freb stepped forward, but Memphis held up his hand to halt them, his other hand on his stomach. He clenched his teeth. \"I don't. I don't want to 'screw' her, unlike you – I have the utmost respect for her. I would rather have her as a friend right now than nothing.\" Sway stared at her ex-boyfriend, a mixture of hatred, respect, and… caring, surging through he. She brought her right arm in front of her eyes and pleaded with them. \"Please... stop.\" Derek struck Randall's jaw with an uppercut, sending him flying – Donny sprinted forward and caught him. The younger ones walked threateningly towards the attacker, but Sara reached him first. \" Move it, you dumb ox!\" she commanded, pulling on his arm. \"Alright. Let's go, Sara,\" he obeyed, and the two were just at the entrance when Memphis mustered up enough strength to express one word – Sway. Derek retorted, \"What!?\" With Donny's assistance, he stood. \"Her name is Sway .\" As eight o'clock approached, the Raines siblings decided to go out, to celebrate Randall's to Long Beach. Since Kipling didn't exactly live the high life, they just went out to a bar, but the elder brother appreciated it all the same. They snagged themselves a table, and began to converse about their lives. Kip took a long swig of his Smirnoff. \"I've got a small house with Mirror Man and Tumbler. I work at Otto's part-time and Mirror Man and me help out at his uncle's restaurant a mile outside of town.\" Memphis imitated his brother's action. \"Awesome. So what about Tumbler?\" A voice interrupted their conversation. \"You called?\" The siblings looked up to see a male Kip's age looking down at them, although he was barely more than brothers' height. He looked almost gothic, wearing mostly black clothing and a long chain that came from the belt hoop on his dark, baggy jeans, extended downward about eighteen inches, and then curved back upward and entering the pocket. As well, he donned a loose, short-sleeved shirt that couldn't have concealed his brawny arms not matter how hard it tried, and his boxer-like build was evident. \"Hey, Tumbler,\" Kip greeted him. He quickly added, \"Memphis was just wondering what you did for a living.\" The muscular one swindled a chair from another table and situated himself alongside the younger Raines. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I see. Well, I'm doing pretty good in Long Beach's ABL.\" Seeing the expression of puzzlement upon Memphis's face, he explained. \"Amateur Boxing League. I'm got a match pretty much every Wednesday. Also, I work here as a bouncer and help Otto, as does all our little group. Pretty cool, huh?\" Memphis shrugged, replying, \"Sure.\" He paused for a moment, observing the neck of the beer bottle. His brother watched him, concerned, until the elder inquired, \"How's Sway been doing these past couple weeks?\" Kip managed to force a small smile. \"Well, Memphis, you know Sway – she doesn't really show her emotions. Been working her ass off at Otto's lately though, at least ten hours everyday.\" Kip sighed. \"But think about it. A week after a huge relationship ends, she comes over with this boyfriend , this objectifying, perverted, jackass fucker with friends to match – doesn't seem very Sway , does it?\" Memphis, who was absentmindedly focused on the people seated at the bar, muttered, \"Yeah… very unlike Sway.\" He began running his thumb and forefinger along the neck of the bottle, slowly, as a fairly tall black man sat. This man observed the occupants of the saloon, until his eyes rested on Kip, Tumbler, and Memphis, and he started over. \"Oh shit,\" mumbled Memphis, \"not again.\" \"Kipling and Randall Raines!\" the adult announced in a falsely cheery voice. \"I just can't believe it – you're back! And you're…\" The boxer plastered a smile onto his face, and answered, \"Tumbler, sir,\" through a tensed jaw. He remembered the first time he'd came in contact with this man, about three years previous, and how he'd desired to 'bonk' him on the head with a lead pipe – Tumbler felt exactly the same now. A chair was freed and the man, a policeman, dragged it over. \"Right, Tumbler… you know boys, this reminds me of three years ago, that little reunion .\" He grinned, thinking of how much trouble this group might cause, now that they were back together. \"Why have you returned, Randall? Family emergency? Business opportunity ?\" He'd put emphasis on the last question for a damn good reason. \"No, Officer, I'm just back to live with my brother,\" replied Memphis, his voice strained. \"And I promise I'll be a good boy, Castlebeck.\" Detective Roland Castlebeck gave the threesome an ' I really don't trust you ' look before leaving them to their drinks. Memphis watched him for a moment and, when the detective had finally noticed, received an expression that planted tension inside him. Then something clicked, and Memphis questioned, \"Kip, you're clean, right?\" \"Damn right, I'm clean! Three years, Memphis!\" replied Kip, frustrated. \"Why would you –\" The oldest of the trio speedily interjected, \"Castlebeck. He'll be by tomorrow. He suspects something; I saw that look in his eyes. Now, are you sure you and your friends are clean?\" Tumbler and Raines Junior glanced involuntarily at each other prior to sharply answering, \"Yes.\" Memphis ran a hand through his hair, as he always seemed to do when worried – like he was now – or frustrated. He started counting people off on his fingers. \"Sway's clean, I'm positive, and Donny, definitely Otto, Sphinx… Atley!\" he exclaimed, slamming his fist onto the table, rattling it. \"Jesus fucking Christ… Where does Atley work?\" A shrug originated from the boxer's brawny shoulders. \"Nobody knows, he keeps quiet about it. We see him every now and then; he usually comes by Otto's on Saturdays.\" This seemed to satisfy Raines senior, as he released a relieved sigh. Tumbler did the same, closely followed by Kipling. \"Anyway, I've got to return to my post… and Memphis, they're here .\" He indicated a table about fifty feet from them before leaving. \"What? Who…\" Memphis scanned the crowded table, mostly surrounded by males though there were a couple beautiful women. His eyes continued journeying until they ceased uneasily on Derek and Sway. Jealousy boiled within him, though he would never admit it. Kip managed to see right through him, though. \"They come here pretty often, Derek and his cronies. Buncha idiots. I told them off once for gawking at Sway butt, but they fought back, seven of them, and I got pretty bloodied up.\" A slight rage surged inside Kipling's brother. Derek ordered – not asked, ordered – Sway to retrieve another pitcher of liquor. As she arose, Derek and one of his friend, a fairly large guy ( 'The bigger they are, the harder they fall,' thought Memphis), slapped her on the backside, and the other half dozen admired it as she walked away. When she arrived and sat at a barstool, Memphis joined her. \"Why do you take that bullshit?\" he questioned her. She looked up at him, surprisingly unsurprised that he was there. \"Memphis…\" she said slowly, softly, the word playing on her cherry lips, \"what the fuck do you want with me?\" He opened his mouth to speak but was unable to locate the words, so promptly shut it. \"Stay away from Derek, and don't gimme your bullshit, alright?\" He stared at her, watching the female order a pitcher of booze, his mouth hanging slightly. Suddenly, he delicately took hold of Sway's forearm, whirling her around, causing the twosome to face one another. \"Sway, I know you're upset and I promise to respect your feelings. I want you to understand that I'm sorry and I don't want you to hate me. I love you.\" That being said, he pulled her into himself and passionately kissed her. After a moment, she forcibly pushed him away as Derek and several others rushed to her side. \"Leave Memphis,\" she instructed, just as two large guys advanced on him. Kipling and Tumbler darted over, joined by a couple others – Mirror Man and Freb. \"Get out before somebody gets hurt.\" Mirror cracked his knuckles and Tumbler toughly flexed his biceps. Memphis bowed his head in defeat, ignoring the victorious expression on Derek's face, and walked out, friends close behind. But before they're all departed, Sara – omitting the yell from her boyfriend to \"get your sexy scrawny ass back here\" – ran up to the last in line, Kip. \"What?\" he snapped. His impression of Sway was a little less than perfect at that moment. She pulled him into a warm, tender, loving embrace and pecked him on the cheek. \"I'm glad you got your Memphis back, hon. Too bad mine couldn't have come along for the ride.\" Me : I know, I know, kinda bland and boring. Shi : Well… it's only your first Gone in Sixty Seconds fanfic. Don't be too hard on yourself.

Chapter Two Atley Jackson and the Sphinx The next morning, the overwhelming scent of eggs and bacon and the unmistakable sound of something frying awaked both Raines brothers. Kipling rose from his mattress, donning nothing but his SpongeBob Squarepants boxers and scrambled to the door opposite his bedroom, banging brutally on it. However, once he did that, he instantly regretted it; clutching his forehead he groaned, knowing those last couple drinks were haunting him. Kip wished great pain on Tumbler when he hollered that he would be finished promptly. \"Mind you Ps and Qs, little brother,\" Memphis announced his arrival, making sure his voice remained relatively quiet. Kip greeted him with a noise of perplexity, looking up at him from the hardwood floor. The first born, in explanation, whispered, \"Pints and quarts, like drinking. Means don't exceed your limits. I learned that a couple weeks ago,\" a sigh of regret escaped his mouth, and to himself he added, \" the hard way .\" The wooden door swung open, revealing a shirtless Tumbler. The dyed-blonde tips of his otherwise brown hair drooped sideways slightly, and a few droplets of water trickled down his chiseled chest. He offered his hand to his best friend and, with a single, quick jerk, stood him upright. \"Honestly, Kip, why do you wear those?\" he inquired, indicating his colorful boxers. \"They're for children.\" \"Oh, like you can talk,\" countered the addressee, pointing to Tumbler's Homer Simpson lounge pants. Memphis shook his head, certain that an argument was brewing, and grinned as he proceeded toward the kitchen, where stood the fourth housemate. Sitting at the small, circular table, he finally realized the horrific state the adjacent living room was in – clothes strewn over the backs of furniture, magazines atop the seats, several empty pizza cartons resting on the floor. He shook his skull disappointedly, noticing the filthy dishes stacked untidily in the sink. The African American male was Kip's age, and was no taller that 5'9\". He had very short dark hair and mischievous blue eyes, the corners of which cringed a little from the smile that was permanently glued onto his face. This friend of Kip's went by the name of Mirror Man, and nobody knew his original name – but nobody asked. He flipped the bacon, being careful no grease flicked onto the drooping, elbow-length sleeves his green and orange cotton robe. After completely tending to breakfast, he followed Memphis's gaze. \"Oh, right. We kind of forgot to clean the dishes for a couple days. Don't mind it, though.\" Memphis released a released a small chuckle, responding, \"A couple days? More like a week, at the least.\" He stalked over to the sink and began running the water. Tumbler came into the kitchen then, and the threesome proceeded to clean the contents of the sink. When they were done five minutes later and their breakfast consisting of bacon and scrambled eggs was resting on the table, the dark-skinned boy stole a handful of bubbles from the sink. Waiting by the kitchen's entryway, he threw it in the direction of the oncoming, still-in-his-boxers Kip, but missed horribly due to the fact that he had no aim and hit Tumbler square in the kisser. Kipling laughed silently, some moisture shaking from his arm – a short wash always did good for him after a night of drinking. \"I'm going to hurt you, Man,\" snarled the boxer, grabbing a dirty sock and smacking the African-American right in the face. Both Raines brothers sighed – nothing had changed since Memphis's last visit – ' Hopefully it won't end like last time, though ,' thought the younger, dodging a dishtowel. He sat opposite his sibling at the table and they dug into their first meal together. Soon, the squabble died down, food was consumed, and conversation was fluent. All good things have to end sometime. This ended with a knock from the front door. The brawniest answered it. After a moment of silence, Mirror demanded, \"Who is it, boy?\" Tumbler returned, followed by a pretty, red-haired girl, whose hair was styled in practiced dreadlocks. She donned a black, elbow-length-sleeved shirt and leather pants, and was removing a pair of sunglasses from her face. The young woman appealingly hoisted her slender frame onto the countertop. \"Oh, dear, I do love topless hunks in the morning,\" she said, eyeing the three Caucasians. Then she turned to the other. \"What's with the robe, Father?\" Mirror Man chuckled and shed it, unveiling his slim body, the only thing covering any part of him being his peacock blue tear-away pants. \"Ta-da! You like this baby?\" He grinned that playful smile he always seemed to wear. Laughter escaped the girl's luscious red lips and, quoting him from three years ago, said, \"Sexy, sexy!\" The petite house was overrun with laughter from all but Memphis. He continued staring at the redhead's face; he felt as though he'd seen her somewhere before, but couldn't place her. Her smooth face, her sexy eyes, her oh-so-familiar sensual voice. Kip arose, joined the female, and began examining her dreads, twisting one in his finger. \"I dunno, red's just so different…\" She simply shrugged, and the eldest male became mesmerized by her feminine figure. The redhead noticed this and shot him an angered glare, one that he knew all too well. \"Sway…?\" \"Yuh-huh?\" she responded in a drawn-out manner. When he remained silent, Sara began running her hand slowly along the elastic of Kip's SpongeBob boxers. \"Hey, I bought you these, didn't I? For Christmas!\" He nodded and she smiled joyfully before patting him on the behind once. \"Shouldn't have, though. You're butt's too small, can't keep them up.\" Memphis glared enviously at his little brother while Tumbler called to Sway, \"Hey, you wanna feel my ass too?\" She shook her head, that playful, un- Sway smile roaming over her facial features. \"Nah, maybe tomorrow. Anyway, what's taking you dumbasses so friggin' long?\" Her hands traveled to her waist in a flippant pose, that foreign smile banished and replaced by a serious, ' Don't fuck with me ' expression. \"C'mon, honeys, get those cute asses in gear before Otto comes up here and kicks you there!\" The corners of Memphis's mouth cringed into a weak smile – she was back, Sway, his Sway. The group of five arrived in as many vehicles, since they didn't want to abandon their beloved 'ladies'. Memphis, second last to arrive, drew stares from his friends, new and old, as he parked his black 2000 Mini Cooper.

Loves, Tasha We agreed not to have kids. Wenwanted to be together but we thought it best if we didn't have anynkids considering both of our pasts. I don't really remember thenthought process we both shared, but I guess we just thought it wouldnbe unfair to the child if a person or event from the past came backnto us. And yet, here I am, standing over a small plastic crib,nlooking in at this small baby lying right in front of me. I curl my fingers slightlynaround the cool plastic as I looked down at the smallest and purestnthing in the world. She was asleep finally, after long hours ofncrying as loud as any person or in this case, baby, could. It REALLY happened so fast…Indidn't believe Sarah when she said she was pregnant. Even as shengrew…I still didn't believe it, it took till this moment for mento believe it. It's like I was watching a movie, I felt her kicknin Sarah's stomach, I held Sarah's hand tightly in the deliverynroom through the birth process, but I guess it never sank in…untilnnow. It wasn't a mistake; I wouldnnever call my newborn daughter a mistake, which is just cruel andnunfeeling. But like I said before, we didn't really want kids andnit was definitely unplanned. It definitely wasn't a mistake on hownMarie happened either. We weren't drunk; Sarah and I were just innthe heat of the moment, in the phase that we get in some times, mostntimes. Only, this time it just happened. Despite the fact that we didn'tnwant any kids…I feel like the luckiest man in the world.[Chapter 2] Memphis stood over a stove, water boiling and ansizzling sound signifying something was frying. Memphis Rains wasnsurprisingly an amazing cook. He hated baking but cooking, he COULDndo. And certainly Sara loved it, for she accused herself at suckingnas far as cooking goes. Memphis moved around the kitchen quicklyntossing some spices into the frying skillet over the chicken. His sneakers moved across the hardwood floor, hisnpants partially covering the back of his shoes, hanging loose againstnhis legs but secure around his waist. His light green long sleevent-shirt was rolled up slightly at the sleeves so he wouldn't getnfood on his shirt. Memphisnnodded as he stuck his thumb in his mouth, licking the creamy saucenoff his finger. He then heard a small giggle behind him. Memphisnfrowned and glanced around him to see his four-year-old daughternclimbing up on this high yet empty computer desk. \" Marie! nNo, Marie get down!\" Memphis warned leaving the kitchennimmediately, walking as fast as he could next to her, but trying notnto alarm her. Mariencould only laughed and accidentally lost her balance, falling overnoff the desk. \" MARIE!\"n Memphis called lunging at her to catch her. Memphisnlanded on his stomach under Marie, who landed on his back, laughingnlouder as she rolled off her fathers back and next to Memphis. Memphisnthen flew up into a sitting position, grabbing her and checking hernall over to see if she got hurt. Seeing nothing wrong with her,nMemphis's right hand flew to his face, whipping it in stress. Saranthen walked into, raising her eyebrow at the scene. Memphisndidn't notice her presence at first, after a couple minutes henfinally looked up at her. \" We neednto get that…\" Memphis closed his eyes for a second, breathingndeeply refraining himself from cursing. Lately he had been watchingnwhat he says more closely, considering. \" Thatnstupid computer desk out of here. That's the third time she fellnoff that thing.\" Memphis complained. Saranlaughed as she picked the tiny girl up in her arms. \" I'mnnot kidding Sara, she's gonna hurt herself.\" Memphis replied asnhe watched her set Marie down in her play pin where most of her toysnwere. Memphisnhad been calling her Sara for about the last six months now. 'Sway'nwas her nickname, her street name. She was married now, a mother asnwell. Her and Memphis's boosting days were over their crime lifenwas also dead and so was her name. Of course she through 'Sara'nto be too girly so Memphis got himself in the habit of calling hern'Sar'. But when Memphis was serious, he would call her by hernfull name. \" RelaxnMemphis, she'll be fine.\" Sara replied walking behind him andngrabbing his tense shoulders in her hands. \" I don'tnunderstand it…\" Memphis began groaning slightly as he felt hernskinny fingers over his muscles. \" I havenstood in the same room, under the glaring gaze of some ofnCalifornia's most dangerous men and I haven't flinched. Ofncourse I have been scared out of my mind you know?\" Memphisnreplied. \" Mhmm.\"n Sara replied telling him she was listening as she massaged hisnshoulders. Memphisnsqueezed his eyes shut tight for a minute as she hit a tough spotnthen slowly reopened his eyes and sighed. \" Butnthat kid makes my heart skip a beat every time she trips.\" Memphisnadded softly. Sarangrinned then wrapped her arms around his neck, placing her chin onnhis left shoulder. \" I thinknI know what's your problem.\" Sara whispered in his ear. Memphisngrinned and took a hold of her wrists and gently yanked her over hisnbody and onto his lap. \" Andnwhat have you diagnosed me with Dr. Rains?\" Memphis asked playingnalong, looking at her with interest. Saransmiled and looked into his eyes. \" Inthink…you're becoming a daddy.\" She answered giggling, makingnMemphis grinning a large smile. \" I thinknthat might be happening. Oh gosh Sar…I'm mutating.\" Henwhispered, her face close to his. \" Wellnwhatever you do, don't loose that kid/teenage inside you. Causenit's hot.\" She commented smiling as she kissed him deeply. Memphisnchuckled through the kiss, loving the woman he had married STILL. Henbegan the think that there will never be a day when he didn't andnhe knew there was never a day when he didn't as well. Even throughnthe six-year period when he left her and Long Beach, she was all hencould think about. And he was grateful that she forgave him. \" So isndinner ready?\" Sara asked in excitement, breaking Memphis out ofnhis thinking world. \" Justnabout.\" Memphis answered staring blankly at nothing before gettingnto his feet and walking into the kitchen to tend to the cooking food. \" Ahh,ndon't you love that you have a great cook for a daddy so you won'tndie thanks to mommy's cooking honey?\" Sara asked smilingnsquatted down in front of Marie who just glowed with a smile. \" Ok,nit's about ready.\" Memphis called from the kitchen. \" Yum.\"n Sara replied excitedly as she picked up Marie and carried her intonthe garlic aroma filled room, setting her down on her high chair. \" Wannanbeer?\" Sara asked Memphis as she opened the fridge. \" Sure.\"n Memphis replied scooping out noodles onto a plate. \" Dadde.\"n A gurgle noise said. \" Yesnsweetheart.\" Memphis replied keeping his concentration on gettingnthe food on the plate. \" I'mnhungry dadde.\" She replied. \" Oh Inbet you are! Daddy's hungry too.\" Memphis replied spinningnaround glancing at her, flashing her a smile. Marie smiled back. \" HEYnnow, don't forget about mommy!\" Sara replied sitting down nextnto an empty seat and the high chair. \" Oh ofnCOURSE! How could we?\" Memphis asked sitting a plate down innfront of her and a plate in front of his chair, then finally a littlenplastic one in front of Marie. They allnstarted eating, no one saying anything besides the small giggles ofnMarie as she fed herself. \" Got ancall from Ava.\" Sara replied wrapping her creamy cheesy noodlesnaround her fork then shoving it into her mouth. Memphis'snright elbow was on the table, his hand holding his fork. He lookednat Sara, then moved his right hand in front of his mouth as henchewed, his eyes telling her to go on. \" She gotnarrested Memphis.\" Sara replied in sadness. \" Fornboosting cars?\" Memphis asked, looking over at Marie who was toonbusy playing in her food. \" Yea,nshe got picked up by the cops last night, she got to call me and shensaid that she might be in jail for a while. For a WHILE!?\" Saranasked not raising her voice but making it known she was upset. \" Wellnyea Sar, Castlebeck kept threatening to put me in there for life allnthe time, you know that.\" Memphis said lowly. \" I know,nbut…I don't know, I just don't know.\" Sara replied as shenlooked down at her food, away from her husband. \" Onlynleads to getting busted or killed, you know that.\" Memphisnreminded as he took a drink from the beer bottle. \" Inknow.\" She assured him then looked up smiling weakly at him. \" Oh,nwhat time is it?\" Sara asked as if she remembered something. Memphisnlooked at his watch. \" 6:02npm.\" He answered. Saranturned around and turned on the small TV sitting in the corner,nflipping it to the news. \" Wantingnto see if there is anything about anything we should know on thentube.\" She said as she flipped it to the local news. Memphisnnodded but didn't really pay attention to it as he pushed a piecenof chicken over to the other side of his plate. \" Dadde,nI want ice-cream.\" Marie whined. Memphisnlooked up at her plate. \" Eat twonmore pieces of chicken babe, then you can have any flavor you want.\"n Memphis replied. \" YAY!\"n She squealed then dug into her chicken bits. \" Memphis.\"n Sara replied nervously grabbing his attention. Noticing she wasn'tnlooking at him but the TV, he drew his attention there as well. \" Predatornis armed and dangerous. The man's name is Jonathan Bensend whondisappeared from the federal prison he was being held at. If anyonenhas any information on the person or his where abouts phone thenpolice immediately at 552-2429.\" The anchor replied. Saranlooked back at him, who's face was emotionless. \" JohnnynB.\" He breathed with disgust.[Chapter 3] Memphis sat on the edge of his little girl's bednin the dark, the only light a small glowing nightlight next to hernbed, giving a warm glow on his face. He found himself doing thisnmany times, staring at her while she slept. It was hard to stop fornhim, every time he came to tuck her in she was just lying there andnonce he started, he couldn't stop. Memphisnmoved a piece of her blonde hair out of her face and smiled tonhimself. He never knew he could love a child so much, but he did tonthe point where his hear just ached, in a good way. Memphis closednhis eyes and bent down, kissing her forehead for a long time, thenngot up and left her room. He closednher door a little ways, leaving a crack open for extra lgith from thenhallways to leak into the room. He sighed and ran his fingersnthrough his hair as he walked down the hall and made his way into hisnbedroom where Sara sat on the bed, her back against the backboard,nstaring at nothing. Memphisnstopped in the doorway, leaning his left shoulder on the frame,ngiving her a serious look, in his head trying to figure out what shenas doing. Her eyesnthen moved over to him but she did nothing else. \" Somethingnthe matter?\" Memphis asked his voice kinda raspy from not speakingnin a while, for he spent the last 15-20 minutes staring at Marie. Sara shooknher head no. Memphisnsighed and looked aside before walking in and closing their doornslightly. He made his way to the bed and sat on the end of it,nsitting his elbows on his knees. \" Sara, Inknow something is wrong. I can see it in your eyes.\" Memphisnmumbled. \" What donyou see?\" she asked curiously but softly. \" Fear.\"n He answered looking back at her. \" Fear?\"n she repeated as if she didn't know the meaning of the word, notnwanting Memphis to see through her. \" Yesnfear, I have spent six years boosting cars, and I know what fearnlooks like in someone's eyes. I have sat in the passengers seat ofna car being chased by people who are gonna kill us and I seen fear innthe drivers eyes, I seen fear in my crew's eyes when things wentnwrong, I saw it in Kip's eyes too much during that big boost we didna while back, I know what it looks like, and you have it.\" Memphisnexplained then turned his body, slightly lying on the bed but holdingnhimself up with his right elbow. Saransighed a shaky sigh, knowing Memphis was right. \" Ok,nfine I am scared, are you happy?\" Sara replied, no being smart butnmaking it a point to Memphis that she was frustrated. \" Whatnare you scared about?\" Memphis asked. Sara saidnnothing but look down at her lap. \" It'snabout Johnny B.'s escape from jail isn't it.\" Memphis answerednafter a couple minutes of silence. \" What ifnit is?\" Sara asked now getting an attitude. Memphisnrolled his eyes, groaning slightly. \" Sara…\"n Memphis began. \" NOnMemphis, that black thug is out of jail, not on parole but he ESCAPEDnfrom jail! And if I remember Kip telling me…you and Johnny Bnaren't EXACTLY on the same side of the FENCE if you know what Inmean!\" Sara replied rising her voice, interrupting him. \" Andnyou're worried that he'll try and show me up?\" Memphis askedncalmly. Saranlooked at him like he was stupid. \" YES OFnCOURSE!\" Sara said in the same tone. \" Sara, Inhave many of other people in this city looking to kill me and theynare NOT in jail, we'll be fine! You don't actually think JohnnynB. was the only guy I pissed off in my day do you? Come on! nEverything will be fine. That loser is so stupid he'll landnhimself back in jail by tomorrow.\" Memphis replied softly. \" Memphis,nyou're NOT getting it. It scares me, I lost you once and I DO NOTnwant to loose you again!\" Sara said in anger, not anger towardsnhim but anger towards the situation. Memphisnwas silent, just looking at her. \" You'rennot gonna loose me. And Johnny B. isn't gonna do anything. Henprobably wont even remember me.\" He said. Sara gavenhim a 'yeah right' look. Memphisnchuckled. \" WHY arenyou psyching yourself out for?\" Memphis wondered. Sarangrinned and looked out the window, out into the beautiful night. \" Do younever miss it?\" She asked as he unlaced and took off his boots. Memphisnlooked back at her, but she was still looking out the window. \" Boostingncars?\" He asked. \" Yea,\"nShe murmured. \" No,\"nMemphis answered tossing his last boot to the floor. Saranlooked over at him. \" Notneven a little bit?\" She asked. \" No, Indon't miss seeing people die, having the crap scared out of me bynthe jack asses who want this car or that car. I don't miss beingnwanted, or watched and I do not miss wondering if I was going to livenor die by the time that certain boost was over with.\" Memphisnreplied. Sarannodded in acceptance and understanding as Memphis studied her face, \" Whatnabout you?\" he asked curiously. \" Kinda,\"nshe admitted. Memphisnraised his eyebrows in surprise. \" I missnthe feeling,\" she added. \" Thenfeeling?\" Memphis repeated. \" Yes thenfeeling of adrenaline, and for the most part, that's all I miss,\"nshe replied finally turning her head to face him. \" I missnyou doing it,\" she admitted as well. \" Me?\" nMemphis replied in surprise. \" Yea younMemphis, you're the only reason why I started boosting cars. Inremember when I first saw you too.\" She said stretching a largensmile on her face. Memphisnlistened with interest. \" I was ansenior and I was walking to my piece of crap car in the parkingngarage after I closed the shop I was working at in the mall. I camendown in the elevator and I saw this car screech to a stop and a guynjump out. I thought a million things and I knew for sure if that guyncame anywhere near me I would beat the lights out of him, but I hidnbehind a wall and watched. It was you, and I saw what you do and…\"nshe began, looking straight into his eyes, who was listeningnintensively. \" I wasnintoxicated. So I found out about cars, everything about them, foundnout where you and your so-called 'gang' was and got in. Why donyou think I went everywhere with you on a boost, even after we werendating. It was hot, watching you do that was a turn on to me. Itnwas like sex.\" She admitted, not being ashamed really, but grinnednslightly. \" So youngot a thrill out of watching me disarm a car?\" Memphis askedngrinning. Sara bitnher bottom lip and shook her head yes. Memphisngrinned wider. \" Thennmaybe I should go down and hotwire our car more often.\" Memphisnreplied. Saransmiled and grabbed the collar of his shirt, yanking him from thenbottom of the bed up on her, at the front of the bed, pressing hernlips to his, and kissing him deeply. Memphisnclosed his eyes, kissing her back with as much passion as he reachednto the side, his fingers feeling around the lamp for the lightnswitch. After he found it he pressed the button and the lights wentnoff. The nextnmorning Sara looked around the kitchen frowning. Memphis chargedndown the stair, fixing the color of his black shirt. \" Heynbaby!\" Sara shouted to get his attention. \" Yup.\"n Memphis shouted back considering he was in the other room. \" Do yanmind doing me a favor pleeeeease?\" Sara asked walking to the samenroom as him, and into his arms, looking at him with the sweetestnface. \" What?\"n Memphis asked giving her the eye. \" Do younmind going to the grocery store to pick up a couple things for me.\"n She asked smiling. Memphisnsighed but grinned acting like he didn't want too. \" FinenI'll go do it.\" She spat in anger, of course she was playing. \" Heynnow!\" Memphis replied grabbing her elbow and twirling her backninto his arms and grasp. \" YesnSar, I would love to go to the grocery store for you.\" Memphisnreplied grinning then let go of her. \" Thanksnyou!\" She replied kissing him on the lips then walking back intonthe kitchen. \" HeynMarie, wanna go to the story with me?\" Memphis asked walking intonthe living room where his daughter sat playing. \" YEAH!\"n She explained in excitement. \" Well,nok, lets find your shoes.\" Memphis replied looking around tryingnto find her shoes. \" Hun,nwhere are Marie's shoes?\" Memphis shouted. \" They'renunder the couch!\" she shouted back. Memphisnreached under their leather couch and pulled out her shoes. \" Alighty,\"nHe replied as he lifted Marie up and sat her on his knee, and startednputting her shoes on. \" Dadde,\"nMarie spoke. \" Yesnsweetie,\" Memphis answered as he stood up holding her in his arms. \" May Inget a toy please?\" Please? Please? PLEASE?\" she asked. \" We'llnsee,\" He answered. \" Sar,nwe'll be back in a while.\" Memphis called. \" Ok, byenbaby,\" She replied kissing Marie on the cheek. \" Bye,nbye mommy,\" She said happily. \" Bye hotnshot.\" She said kissing Memphis on the lips. \" Later,\"nhe said the opened the door, putting his sunglasses on with the othernfree hand as he and Marie walked out into the bright warm day. Memphisnwalked into the small yet well air-conditioned store. They werengreeted by the clerk who Memphis nodded a hello too. \" Ok,nmommy's list says she needs chocolate syrup…yummy, wonder if wencould talk mommy into making us two milkshakes this evening.\" nMemphis replied walking down one isle. \" YEA! nYUMMY!\" Marie agreed excitedly. \" RandallnRains.\" A voice said. Memphisnlooked to his right seeing a familiar face. Memphis's face grewnserious as he sat Marie down who ran to the end of the isle tonexamine a toy hanging from the side. \" DetectivenDrycoff.\" Memphis answered. \" Haven'tnseen you in a while man.\" He answered. Memphisngrinned. \" Wellnthat means I have been keeping myself out of trouble then doesn'tnit?\" He answered in a smart aleck tone. \" Yea,nand I am STILL scraping the crap out of my boxers from that littlenchase scene I was involved with, with you thanks to Castlebeck.\" nHe said crossing his arms. \" Well,nyou know what they say Drycoff, if you wanna catch a car booster, youngotta drive like one.\" Memphis answered smiling lowering hisnsunglasses. Drycoff'snface twisted in frustration and he then grabbed Memphis's rightnarm, twisted it behind his back and showed him into the isle,npressing his body and face against the potatoes chip bags. \" Inshould arrest you right now you asshole, I don't know HOW you gotnaway but you shouldn't have.\" Drycoff said behind clenchednteeth. \" On whatncharges Detective, granted I have had a past with that but you havenno evidence.\" Memphis answered. \" Nonevidence!? How about the wreck you left Long Beach in the lastncouple years ago HUH SMART GUY!?\" He asked tightening his gripncausing Memphis to clench his teeth and close his eyes in pain. \" Correctnme if I'm wrong, but I believe that case was close was it not?\" nMemphis answered grinning to himself. \" Dadde! nWhat's going on!?\" Marie asked almost in a scream, her lipnquivering from fear. Memphis'sncareless manner was gone as he looked over at his daughter. \" Ohnnothing honey, daddy and his friend here are just playing. You knownhow you and I play fight right? This is the same thing.\" Memphisnanswered. Drycoffnthen let go of Memphis; too busy staring at the small girl. \" Younhave a kid now?\" Drycoff asked. Marie just stared back at him. \" Yes.\"n Memphis answered rubbing his arm. \" Finenscrew you going to jail, we'll just take her out of your custody.\"n Drycoff replied. Memphis'snmind and heart filled with rage as he clutched the man's collar. \" If younEVER try to take her away from me I'll-\" Memphis began. \" YonRains!\" A voice said. Memphisnand Drycoff both looked in the direction of the voice to see threenblack men including Johnny B. standing in the entrance. Memphisnthrew Drycoff down and then lunged at Marie, diving on top of her asna shot rang out, just missing Memphis's foot. His bodynand her body scatted across the floor, out of range. Memphisngot up and lifted the small girl in his arms, pressing her tightnclose to his body as he squatted down behind an isle. He could feelnher small hands clutch his shirt tightly, in fear. Memphisnbreathed hardly in fear as he peered around the isle. Memphis thennstood up and started running to the exit, but Johnny B's mennstarted shooting and with that Memphis stopped dead in his tracks asnhe took shelter behind another isle. Memphisnlooked down at Marie who was crying. \" How didnyou get to be so brave? Huh? How?\" He asked smiling trying tonget her to feel better and calm down. Memphisnlooked around in panic then saw the cashier, the only on there, reachnup and pick up the phone. Memphis's first choice was he wasndialing 911. After Memphis thought it was safe he ran over behindnthe desk to see Drycoff hidden behind there as well. \" Don'tnlet her out of your SIGHT!\" He demanded handing Marie over to him,nthen shot up and ran behind the other isle. Memphisnran along the isles, searching for them. He peered around anothernisle to see one of his three thugs standing there looking around. nMemphis flew up behind him, kicking the gun out of his hand. nSurprised he threw a punch at Memphis who caught it and then kneednhim the gut. To finalize the act Memphis backhanded him allowing hisnbody to crash to the ground. Anothernheard to struggle and came to his friend's rescue, landing a blownin Memphis's face. He shook it of and kicked him in the balls,nletting him fall to the ground. Once he was there Memphis powerfullynkicked him in the face. Suddenlynhe felt someone grab him from behind. He felt himself being spunnaround and shoved up against one of the cool doors that kept thenbottled pop and Gatorade cold. His cheek felt the cool air throughnthe glass as he felt the front of his body and his cheek pressedntightly against the door, his left hand behind his back. \"' EllonRains, been a long time boy.\" A voice said chuckling. Memphisnstruggled someone what but realized that was more painful than justnstanding. Memphis breathed hard as his body burned, especially hisnarm. \" Saw younon TV Johnny, escaping from jail…what are you still doing in LongnBeach?\" Memphis asked. \" Don'tnchange the subject FOOL!\" He shouted, the took his head and slammednit into the glass, creating a large crack in it, allowing Memphis tonfall back first to the ground. Memphisntouched his forehead with his right hand, and pulled it away hisnfingers covered in blood. \" I gotn10 years thanks to you!\" he shouted taking out a knife. \" Andnyou're gonna get life now for escaping, smart move.\" Memphisnreplied, a large cut in the middle of his head, blood oozing from it. Johnnynthen lunged at him, digging the knife into the material of his jacketnand digging it through the tiles of the floor, pinning him there. Memphisnactually shuttered in fear, of how close the blade was to his skin. \" I don'tncare, now that I know you'll be dead.\" He hissed in his face. Memphisnthen kneed him in the gut, and then kicked him off him as he sent hisnfree arm to the grip of the knife and yanked it out of the floor andnoff his jacket, throwing it aside, which it stopped underneath anvending machine. Johnnynstill got to his feet sooner than Memphis and grabbed hold of hisnshirt, yanking Memphis close to him, cocking his gun and putting thenfront to his head, digging it into his skin. Memphisntried to get away but Johnny's grip stood. Memphis could thinknnothing, couldn't see anything except his daughter and Sara. nSuddenly a shot fired out. Memphis and Johnny looked to the side tonsee Drycoff. \" I'llnsettle this later bastard.\" He hissed then shoved Memphis into thencorner of the isle then ran out, his other boys running after, somenlimping. Memphisnhit the corner and fell to the floor. He groaned and clutched hisnhead again. Drycoff chased after Johnny B. but they ran through thenstore to the back and out the exit. Once Drycoff got to the exit,nthey were long gone their car screeching off. Memphisngot to his feet and ran to the front desk, grabbing Marie and pickingnher up. \" Dadde!!\"n she literally screamed clutching him tight, hugging him. Memphisnthen ran out the door and to his car, getting away from Drycoff andnJohnny and his gang, for as he knew, they were still in therensomewhere. Memphisnunlocked the door and quickly strapped her in to her seat in the backnthen jumped into the driver's seat, turning the car on and pullingnout of the parking lot, driving fast. \" Dadde,nyou're bleeding!\" Marie said in horror. \" It'snok baby, it's just all…a game.\" Memphis replied glancing backnand giving her a smile. She smiled back weakly. Memphisnpulled into their driveway quickly, getting Marie out and running tontheir front door. They busted through, causing Sara to frown andngreet them. Shenshrieked once she saw Memphis. \" OHnCRIST MEMPHIS WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!?\" She screamednrunning to him and clutching him, Marie in between them. \" Hurrynup and pack, we're leaving town tonight.\" He instructed.

It was the perfect night to go boosting because it would be harder to work up a sweat. Kip, Freb, mirror man and I were out getting the Porsche. It was definitely going to be one of the harder cars to nab given the fact that it was inside a dealership but anything was possible, right? Kip and I were the only two, besides Tumbler and Toby, who had known the car was inside the dealership, we thought it would be the best way to keep everyone calm. \"The corner of Wiltern and Weatherly…Tumbler messed up, it's not here.\" I looked across the street and then laughed silently and both Kip and I said \"He didn't mess up its right there\" Freb and mirror man looked all around and then across the street. \"That\" Freb asked but before he can finish mirror man cut him off. \"Kip you got to be shittin' me man\" mirror man than looks at me and says \"you knew about this?\" I shrugged my shoulders \"Ah come on Arriella, you are supposed to be the smart one, you are supposed to be the one to discourage him from doing stupid shit like this. I looked at him, raised my eyebrows, and smiled. \"That's still my Job? I thought I gave up babysitting when we called it quits?\" I paused \"He told me he wasn't going to do anything stupid, I need the money. If he plays it smart it can be done.\" I heard Kip mumble something under his breath about babysitting. Mirror man was the only person I was paying attention to and he said \"and how is he supposed to play it smart?\" I paused, I hadn't exactly thought of that, but I figured Toby would have something in mind. Mirror man sighed at my own stupidity and then looked at Kip \"How are we supposed to get in? Tell me you and Toby worked something out.\" Toby and Mirror man were great with electronics. If Mirror man couldn't do it than Toby could and vice versa. Kip grinned at him then said \"Let me out, I need my tool.\" While he was getting out he said \"Pop the trunk while you're at it.\" Me and mirror man exchanged a look, this was not good at all. \"Kip what tool?\" I asked worriedly. Kip jumped out of the car, ignoring my question, and leaving the door open so that me and mirror man could get out. \"Kip, god damn it answer me, what tool? You and Toby made some kind of plan didn't you?\" I should have never gone along with this plan. I needed the money and the thrill. I had been busy so I had left a lot of the planning to Kip and the guys but the car being inside the store had been the one aspect that Kip had let me in on, somewhat reluctantly at that. We got to the trunk and Kip opened it and grabbed for something that I couldn't quite make out. Mirror man had though \"A BRICK!\" He stated incredulously. \"A brick is not a tool. If you are going to use that we might as well call up Folsom and make reservations.\" I looked between both of my friends and then glared at Kip \"Kip, don't do this, if I get in trouble, I swear to god I will kill you.\" Kip looked at me \"Leave then. This isn't for the faint of heart and besides you gave up babysitting duty right?\" I stopped at his words, Kip had never told me to leave before, we had gotten into fights over his stupid pranks but never had he told me to leave. Kip was angry as hell with me and it stung but I had to get over it. Finally, I got myself together again and started walking. \"I can't leave Kip and you know that, I need the money, but I swear if I get in trouble with the cops you'll be begging them to lock your fucking ass up.\" Mirror man laughed and Kip grunted. We had made it to the window and Kip threw the brick through the window. It made a loud crash and a few seconds later the alarm went off. I started panicking then. When a person boosts there is always a possibility of getting caught and you know that and most people were willing to risk it, for the most part so was I but this was suicide. If a person played their cards right they wouldn't get caught but an alarm going off before they even set foot into the car was not good at all. I was pulled out of my reverie when Mirror man tapped me on my shoulder indicating we were ready to leave. I jumped into the backseat, not wanting to sit next to Kip because I was so pissed off. \"Okay Billy badass you got us in here now how the hell you plan on getting us out?\" Mirror man asked somewhat sarcastically. \"You had to ask\" I said anger, exasperation and sarcasm mixing at the same time. I pointed to the window right in front of us. \"Ah shit.\" Was all mirror man had time to say before Kip sped up and jumped the car out of the window. I grabbed on to the Kip's seat, reflexively, and then let go hoping he hadn't noticed but I saw that Kip had a grin on his face and I knew he had. I cursed under my breath, just what I needed, Kip knowing I was scared shitless. The Porsche hit the street and we sped away towards our destination. Kip, of course, couldn't go without making a little noise so he squealed the tires and laughed. I felt like slapping him across the head but given the fact that he was driving and we were not an item anymore it probably wouldn't go over very well, so I just tightened my hold on the seatbelt I had decided to wear and swore under my breath. Kip looked up at the rearview mirror and into my eyes and said \"You okay back there Angel?\" Kip had started calling me Angel way back when we first met. According to him, I was his Angel. I used to find it romantic, now it just pissed me off. I rolled my eyes at him and flipped him off; he laughed and sped up, Kip knew I hated going fast during a boost, being the responsible person I was. Let me rephrase that, Kip knew I hated going fast in a car that had definitely been reported and this one had. He was totally egging me on. \"Kip, were in a stolen car.\" Mirror man said. \"A fast stolen car\" Kip added. \"Like that makes a difference\" I said under my breath. Kip looked at me through the rearview mirror and smiled \"It does when you won't get to drive a car like this for a long time baby.\" He was right, cars like this were way above our spending limit, even when we boosted. \"You got that right hun, except soon we won't be driving any cars because we will all be in prison .\" Kip laughed and Mirror man gulped and said. \"Man I should have never come along with this.\" Finally, after what seemed like hours we got to a stop light. I was thanking god and everything in between until Kip rolled down his window. \"Hey\" He said to the beautiful blond next to us. \"Kip, stolen car.\" Mirror man and I said in unison. Mirror man was grabbing at him trying to pull him back. \"No… No\" Kip said pushing mirror man off. The girl turned her head our way and Kip said \"Baby you are so talented\" The beautiful blond in the car next to us rolled her eyes in a dramatic way but you could tell she was enjoying the attention. Kip revved the engine, waited for the light to turn green, once it did, he put his foot on the gas, yelled \"I love you\" to the blond and we were jamming. I felt like I was on a roller coaster at that point. I felt my body slam into the seat; I felt my stomach jump to where my heart should be and my heart jump to my throat. I think I am going to be sick. The car that Kip had been racing was no competition at all and we lost it not too long after we started the race. \"This is why we broke up!\" I yelled. \"Why? Because I have good taste in woman?\" \"No, because you're a jackass.\" I said somewhat angrily. Mirror man laughed and Kip said \"Don't laugh, that's not funny,\" He looked at me through the rearview mirror and said \"That's not funny\" Mirror man patted Kip on the shoulder \"Man, that's funny and so god damn true.\" I smiled a little too; mirror man always had a way of lightening the mood. Kip sighed but didn't say anything as we pulled into the spot where we held base. Kip honked, which indicated to the others that it was us, once he got the car into the warehouse and stopped the car Mirror man jumped out and I followed suit. Tumbler said something to Atley Jackson who was supposed to be our babysitter. Atley smiled and then came over and patted Kip on the shoulder and said \"goes 0-60 in 5.2 seconds\" Kip nodded his head and mirror man exclaimed \"I can vouch for that man\" Mirror man was acting like ten seconds ago he wasn't ready to piss his pants. I rolled my eyes in disgust and anger, Atley must have caught it because he came over to me \"Something the matter?\" I walked away from him and nodded my head 'no'. Everyone was all excited at the prospects of having gotten thirteen cars done. Tumbler marked off the Porsche and started handing out beers. He got to Toby and said \"You can't have any you're too young.\" Toby groaned but it was the only protest he would make on the subject. He knew there was no way he would win. He was only seventeen; the baby of the group and everyone thought it was their job to take care of him. \"What's that noise?\" Atley asked worriedly. I stopped my thinking to listen and heard a thump thump and then saw some lights shit I thought cops. The others must have thought the same thing because they all yelled \"Cops, let's get the hell out of here!\" We all started running here and there cleaning up what we could. I was almost out the door when I heard someone break the black light and then I heard Atley say \"Now you have gone and done it Raines.\" I thought to myself definitely. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx When I had first joined the gang about five years ago, I had been fourteen years old at the time; we had made plans that if we ever had to make a run for it we would meet at Danny's, an all night pool hall around the block from our old school. The only reason Kip wanted to meet there was because the owner, Danny, knew Kip's older brother Memphis and he would let us drink and what not as long as we had our fake I.D.'S. It took us all a good hour to regroup, but that was to be expected. I was the last one to arrive and I got a loud greeting. \"ANGEL!\" Kip yelled from across the room \"I thought they caught you baby!\" I rolled my eyes in loathing and walked over to the group. Tumbler was being assaulted by two bimbo's, Toby and Freb were sitting next to him staring at him in wonder, they were not as lucky at attracting female attention. Kip had two empty beers in front of him and one half empty one in his hand; those three beers were probably not his only three and probably would not be his last. Mirror man had a beer and was sipping it nervously looking about as if expecting cops to come busting through the door and arrest us all at any moment. I put a hand up to cover a smile that was coming to my lips; mirror man hated it when I laughed at his paranoia. I made it to the table and reluctantly sat down next to Kip which was the only seat available. Kip must have sensed my reluctance because he said \"You aren't mad at me are you angel?\" I looked at him angrily \"Don't call me that\" \"Ah come on baby\" He said putting his arm around my shoulder. I shook it off and waved the waitress over. \"Can I have a seven and seven?\" The waitress shook her head and left. Since I had arrived everyone had sobered up, except for Kip, who was whispering something to one of the girls on Tumblers lap. I sighed and grabbed for Kips beer which I missed the first time but got the second time. \"Hey\" He protested. I ignored his protesting and said \"Sooo what's going on?\" No one answered. I had known it wasn't going to be good news but obviously this was worse than I had expected. I sighed. \"Someone needs to answer me. Keeping me in the dark is not going to do anything.\" The waitress had returned with my drink and I was sipping it, slowly. Kip looked at me and grimaced. \"They aren't answering my calls. But, we can do the job, we got thirteen cars in one week, we just got to up our game and show them we got this shit under control.\" When the person in charge of a job does not answer the crew runner they asked to carry it out that is not a good sign. It meant they had lost trust in them. It also meant that they were making plans without that person; which could entail death or torture or just a \"friendly\" reminder not to fuck up again. However, we were dealing with Raymond Calitri and he was more of the death and destruction type of guy. I snorted and everyone looked at me grimly, if I didn't think we could do it, it probably couldn't get done. \"We were supposed to get fifty cars done guys; thirteen is nothing. What the hell were you thinking taking a job for Calitri that you could not do? You might have been able to do 50 cars in two weeks but there is no way to do 50 cars in one week I—\" \"Actually\" Tumbler said a bit slowly, as if he didn't want to, \"we have five days\" Then he looked at his watch and said 'actually, four days.\" \"What?\" \"We procrastinated a bit\" Kip said. \"Brilliant\" I said angrily. \"Calitri is going to kill us.\" Kip had asked Calitri for a Ten thousand cash advance which him and the guys had spent on booze and a get a way car also known as a get there car. \"We procrastinated because we needed another hand and your fucking ass wouldn't call me back.\" I looked around the table. \"Oh no, you are not going to blame this shit on me. When did Calitri let it slip that he was thinking about hiring you for a job? A month ago? Two months ago? You should have gathered your team then, not a couple days before Kip!\" I slammed my drink down on the table, most of it spilled out which left me only a sip which I downed quickly. \"I don't need this shit god damn it!\" Kip said angrily. I was about to say something but Toby and Mirror man cut in \"Guys, come on fighting isn't going to solve this.\" Mirror man put his hand on my arm and rubbed it \"Now\" Mirror man continued \"all we need is to gather a bigger team, got any people in mind?\" He looked at me. \"Jake and his team, their good\" \"Jake won't help\" Kip exclaimed. I looked at him and smirked \"Cause you fucked his ex?\" I said pointing at Kip \"or because you fucked his sister?\" I said pointing to Tumbler. Tumbler laughed but Kip looked uncomfortable. \"He won't destine people to die. I'll see what I can do.\" I looked around. \"There is nothing more we can do tonight. Besides, I am tired, call me tomorrow around noon and I will tell you what I have worked out.\" At this point everyone dispersed except Kip and Tumbler who stayed. They would probably stay have a couple more drinks, fuck those whores that were hanging on them and call it a night. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I was making my way home when I felt a tap on my shoulder; I jumped a mile but relaxed when I heard \"Damn Angel, you don't remember my touch anymore.\" I looked at him, annoyance present on my face and said \"What happened to Tumbler and the Bimbo's?\" He laughed \"Them? They don't mean anything to mean, just a good time, you know? You though, you meant something.\" I looked at him from the corner of my eye \"Kip your drunk, go sober up and then come talk to me okay.\" He laughed \"Me drunk, nah, I haven't even had that many drinks tonight.\" I laughed \"No? What would you classify as not too many?\" \"Ah you know twelve or thirteen-ish\" Truthfully, twelve to thirteen beers wasn't a lot for Kip; mainly it just caused him to get a little emotional and loud. I laughed loudly this time. Kip smiled too. \"So, what happened to us Angel?\" He was serious this time. \"Kip, Don't do this right now okay.\" I said sadly. I hated talking about our split. \"No, I want to know what happened. We had something good. I know we did, you even said we did. But, all of a sudden it was like, bye Kip, see ya, you don't matter. I mean what the hell was that?\"I knew I had hurt him but there had been a lot to my decision to leave him. I wanted to protect him for the most part and leaving him was the best way to accomplish that. Kip had been a senior when we met, I was in ninth grade. We met in P.E., the only class he tried in, we hit it off right away, mostly, and he invited me to go hang out with him and his gang. They had been in to petty crime at the time, stealing little things and then one day Kip mentioned his older brother Memphis and his car stealing days, we decided to try it and we all liked it and that's how our boosting days together had started. At first it started out with Mirror man, Kip, Tumbler and me. However, Toby and Freb had come along not to long after. Toby lived close to the Raines his entire life. Supposedly he had known Memphis. We took Toby on two years ago, he had been fifteen; the guys had done it more out of sympathy than anything else. Toby wasn't good at making friends; he's a shy kid who doesn't really know how to interact with people. When he has conversations with people he starts bringing up facts about computers and electronics which a lot of kids his age are not interested in. Toby always liked Kip and the gang and one night we had seen him getting picked on by some kids who happened to be in my graduating class. Kip, Mirror man, and Tumbler beat the shit out of them and I mended Toby's wounds. Ever since that night he stuck to us like glue, in a way it had been a good thing because he had brought a lot of handy little gadgets and the whole hacking scene to our outfit, mirror man had done the same thing but Toby enhanced it. Freb, on the other hand, had been the first person I had befriended when I moved to Long Beach and one day I had asked him if he wanted to hang with the guys and I at lunch, he was not good at making friends either, he agreed and one thing led to another and he started hanging out with us a year after I joined the gang. Neither Freb nor Toby were allowed to do much of anything. Basically they did odd jobs, Toby did the hacking but he never went out on a job, Freb ordered pizza for the most part and would occasionally go with us on a job but he never got his hands dirty. Our motto was if we got in trouble Freb could always plead ignorance. I had been reluctant about letting Freb join, I mean it had been my idea to let him eat lunch with us but I had never intended him to help us boost, but we had needed someone to help with the \"get away\" car so we decided on Freb. Anyway, I had joined the gang and we had all hit it off great. Two years after joining Kip and I had gotten together and things had been good until about a month or two ago. Kip was the nicest guy. Although he would never let me admit it to anyone, he was sensitive to others needs, which is one of the things I had really liked about him. His looks were not that bad either. He had dark brown hair that he liked to wear slicked back, he was 5'11, which was good given my 5'6 frame, it would have sucked if he were extremely tall because then I would have to look up to him and if he were short, well looking down on your boyfriend wasn't the best thing in the world. He wasn't puny but he wasn't too buff, which I liked and he had tattoos. \"Look Kip,\" I finally said \"What we had, it was puppy love, it wasn't anything special, it wasn't going to last so I did the responsible thing and broke it off. I mean, you've said it a million times before \"Arriella Grace, you are the most complicated girl I know.\" You aren't good with complicated, it would not have lasted. So I called it off.\" \"Bullshit\" Was all he said. I looked at him and sighed \"Kip, that shit you pulled tonight, it might have been cool when we first met, when I was a kid, but now, I am not in to that shit, you know? I need someone who is mature and that just isn't you? I could tell by the look that came across Kips face that I had hit a soft spot \"So what, Jake is mature?\" Kip had thought, and I had not led him to believe otherwise, that Jake and I had hooked up which might have been the reason Kip had slept with Jake's ex, who at the time was his girlfriend, just to spite him, an eye for an eye. I looked Kip in the eye, wanting to end the conversation and said \"Yeah, like Jake.\" \"Fine, go be with Mr. Mature ass Jake and I will leave you the fuck alone. Just remember one thing, when Jake leaves you for the next hot commodity, I won't be there for you okay?\" I smiled at him and said \"I've never needed you Kip. You were just for fun. The next relationship, Jake for example won't be for fun, it will be for real.\" I knew what I was saying was hurting him but that's what I was aiming for. I needed Kip to give me up. I knew Kip had fallen for me hard and I needed him to let go. It could never work out between us. There were certain obstacles that would prevent us from being together and I figured it would be easier to stop the relationship sooner. In reality I had let it go on too long, almost three years, but the truth of the matter was I had fallen for Kip just as hard as he had fallen for me. \"Fuck off\" was all Kip said as he walked away. I turned away, tears burning my eyes, and walked home. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Kip Raines was walking down Walker and first thinking about the conversation he had just had with his Ex. Who in the hell did she think she was? He had invited her to hang out with his friends, he had treated her like a princess or some shit and then she goes and steps on him like he was a piece of dog shit, what the fuck man? Kip was so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn't hear the car cruising behind him stop. He also did not hear the occupants of the car get out. He did however feel someone tap him on the shoulder; he turned around expecting Arriella and was surprised to see a big burly and extremely ugly man looming behind him. Shit was all he could think before he felt a fist smash into his face. His body slammed to the ground and he screamed out \"wait man, let's talk about this, my gang and I can work this out, we can do it, you just got to give us time.\" The ugly man laughed and punched Kip again. Kip saw darkness and nothing else. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I am sure you noticed I changed a few things around…if you haven't I won't mention what those things were. I hope you like this story. I was a little reluctant about writing it because I have never written Romance fic with a character that is already developed like Kip is. However, I was bored one day ( which does not happen much) so I was watching Gone in 60 seconds and Arriella came into my mind and then her story came to my head. I tried pushing her out of my head because I have other stories I am working on but she really wanted to be written so I had to oblige. Please read and review. Hope you like and if you have any questions you can message me or put them in the review and I will try to answer. Thanks[Chapter 2] ChapternTwo: Four Days Till Deadline We'venlearned to run from anything uncomfortable, we've tied our painnbelow and no one ever has to know that inside we're broken. I trynto patch things up again to calm my tears and kill these fears.n---Paramore: Miracle Consideringnhow far from home I was, I got there in record time. I lived in thendecent part of Long Beach, not the rich part but not the poor part,nbasically the middle class. A person probably should not walk homenafter dark fell but, I had pepper spray and I knew how to take carenof myself. Hah! Besides, what was a girl to do? I had to make moneynfor my family's survival and that entailed staying out late somennights. I had a car, a 1965 mustang coupe, but I never drove itnaround when I was taking part in a boost because if I had to leave itnbehind, I would be caught in an instant due to registration. Inentered my three bedroom house and noted that the television was on,nI looked around, and I saw my dad slouched in our recliner, passednout. I started walking over to him and shook him awake. \"Dad\" Inwhispered, not wanting to wake my sisters and uncle who were sleepingnin the bedrooms. He didn't budge at first so I shook him harder andnspoke a little louder \"Dad!\" Finally,nhe started awake with a groan and then squinted as if trying to makenout who was bugging him. \"What?\" He finally mumbled. \"I-Inyou should go to sleep.\" \"Inwas sleeping until you woke me up.\" He grumbled. My father and Indid not get along very well. He blamed me for my mother's death andnI blamed him for us having to rely on my asshole of an uncle. Insighed angrily and mumbled under my breath about my father'snstupidity. \"Yeah, I meant you should go sleep in your room.\" \"Oh\"nhe said. He started getting up then. He was a tall man about six feetntall. He had blond hair and pool blue eyes. He used to be muscularnbut after my mother's death, six years ago, he had sort of letnhimself go, he wasn't fat but he had a little pooch. He startednmaking his way towards his room; he didn't even turn around and sayngood night. Inrolled my eyes in anger and frustration and then walked towards mynown room as well. Myndad blamed me for my mother's death because my parents werensupposed to pick me up on the day she had died, but they had beennlate. I was pissed off when they ended up coming, my mom had beenndriving and my anger had been directed at her; we had been so intonthe argument that my mother had missed the light turning red. We gotnhit by a Chevy truck and my mom ended up being declared DOA(dead onnarrival), I was in a coma for a couple of days. Afternthe accident things had changed between my father and me. Before thenaccident we had been best friends, after, he could barely stand tonlook at me let alone have a conversation with me. Ingot to my room and silently opened the door, hoping not to wake myntwo younger sisters. After my mother had died, my father, my twonsisters and I had come to live with my uncle Steve, my dad's oldernbrother. He had a three bedroom house which meant that my sisters andnI had to share a room. Ingot into my room and I noticed that Allie's, my fifteen year oldnsister's, side of the bed was not occupied. I was a little annoyednby this figuring she had gone to her boyfriend of the week's house.nSince I wasn't too bothered by my younger sister's absence Instarted changing out of my normal boosting outfit; tight black jeans,nlavender tank top, and a black hoodie. It was the most comfortablenoutfit I had and the most inconspicuous. It could do without thenlavender but lavender was my favorite color and I hated wearingnoutfits that were completely bland. WhennI was completely undressed and in my pajama's; a light pink shirtnwith black lace and night pants with black puppy paws, Charlotte, mynyoungest sister started to stir. I stopped everything I was doing tonno avail, her pool blue eyes opened and she looked straight at me. \"Arie?\" \"Yeahnbaby?\" I asked softly, as if talking to her like that would lurenher back to sleep. \"Youndidn't pick me up from school today.\" Ininhaled deeply; I had promised her, even when I had started boosting,nwhich she knew very little about, that I would almost always pick hernup. She had this strong attachment to me; I was the mother she didn'tnhave. It was a burden and a gift all wrapped up in one. \"I knownbaby but I had a job to do. Someone has to make the money rightnkiddo?\" Shenlooked at me skeptically. \"Daddy has a job.\" Charlotte, Charlienfor short, still had a deep admiration for our father. She was sixnyears old and the admiration she held for our father was reasonable.nIt would end soon; at least I kept telling myself that. It would benso much easier when she quit looking to dad for help and love andneverything else fathers were supposed to do. I mean, it wasn't thatndad didn't give Charlie and Allie attention and love; he justndidn't give it to them all the time, like they needed. So, it wasnalways left to me to explain to Charlie that \"daddy wasn'tnfeeling good or Daddy was late because he was having drinks withnfriends.\" I had done the same for Allie but she grew out of hernadmiration for him a couple years ago, now she was just a pain in thenass. But, to be fair, the past year or so, dad had been around fornChalie and Allie more. \"Inknow girlie, but dad doesn't make enough, so I have to go out andnmake the rest.\" Tell her some truth, that was my style, not thenwhole truth because I didn't want her to become a loser like me,nbut I didn't want to lie to her because I didn't want her to hatenme. LikenAllie? \"Doesn'tnUncle Steve make the rest of the money?\" Inlooked at her. Damnnthis kid is so inquisitive. I thought to myself. \"You know, Uncle Steve only makes enough tonpay for himself, not for the four of us too.\" I was smoothing overnthe truth, only telling her a little of it. The truth was that Steven made enough money, combined with my father's income, to pay for usnall but he wouldn't. From the minute I had come to his 'quaint'nlittle home he had made that quite clear. Flashback: Mynmom died in December and by February things were falling apart. Myndad was drinking more and more and all the 'motherly' duties werenleft to me. Cooking, cleaning, taking care of my sisters, who at thentime were very young; Charlie was only a couple months old and Allienwas nine years old. I tried my hardest to make things work but Infailed miserably. Eventually, reluctantly, I called our only livingnrelative, Uncle Steve. Ingrabbed my mother's phone book which consisted of only a couple ofnnames. She kept uncle Steve's name under R, which I always foundnstrange but she explained was easier because \"he was our onlynrelative\". I flipped to the R section and I saw the name F. I hadnasked my mom about it once but she had evaded my question, hurtnclearly written on her face. Right under the name F I found UnclenSteve's number. I prayed silently that the number would work andnreluctantly dialed his number. Inhad always disliked my Uncle, he gave me this weird vibe, but Indidn't want my family to fall apart any more than it had and Infigured he was the only person that could help. When I called him, henseemed very surprised, which wasn't odd considering my mother didnnot like him either. My uncle and I talked about little things atnfirst, the weather, school and then he had asked how things were. Inwas reluctant to tell him but if I didn't the phone call would havenbeen pointless. \" Things are…notnso good right now.\" I finally managed to spit out. I heard my unclensigh into the phone. \"I knew your dad would take your mom's deathnhard, she was the love of his life. What exactly is going on?\" I hated raggingnon my dad, I didn't want to tell my uncle that my dad was drinkingnall the time, he had taken a leave of absence from work which wasnalmost up and it didn't look like he was anywhere near ready to gonback. However, I remembered the reason I called him was to get somentype of help so I knew I had to speak up. \"He's drinking morenthan usual and his leave of absence from work is up soon and I don'tnthink he has made plans to go back.\" A long silencenfrom my Uncle, a heavy sigh and then \"Hang in there okay, I willncome down right away.\" My uncle lived in Long Beach, we lived innFresno. It was quite the ride. I nodded my headnand then remembered he couldn't see me \"Yeah, alright. I-I do younhave the address?\" \" Yeah, your dadngave it to me when your mom passed. Sorry I couldn't make it to hernfuneral by the way.\" \" Huh, oh nonproblem,\" I sighed, that definitely was not the right thing to sayn\"My dad missed you, but he understood, works important.\" \" Yeah.\" Wasnall he said. \"Look, I have some vacation time so I can drive downntonight, if all goes well I should get there in six to eight hours.\" I looked at thenclock on the stove, it was five pm, I counted in my head \"Sonbetween 11:00pm and 1:00 am?\" I asked \"You don't have to donthat; you can wait till morning to come.\" He laughed \"No,nthat's okay; I would like to see you guys any ways.\" I nodded my headnin understanding \"Okay, see you later.\" \" Right.\" Thennhe was gone. Input the phone down, wondering if I had done the right thing. Mynmother had never liked Uncle Steve and I always felt somewhatnuncomfortable around him but he sounded nice enough. Whatnelse was I supposed to do? Mynfamily was falling apart. My dad was spending most of our money onnbooze barely leaving enough for food. I was pretty sure we werenbehind in the mortgage on the house and if he didn't go back tonwork things would be even worse. Indidn't have much time to dwell because I heard Charlie crying;nobviously she had woken from her nap. I waited a couple minutes,nhoping my dad would get some type of epiphany and go pick up his babyndaughter who desperately needed some parental love. No such luck, Inwalked into the room, which Charlie and Allie shared, picked up thenbaby and rocked her back and forth. Whethernor not I did the right thing doesn't matter, I cannot keep livingnlike this. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Justnas my uncle had said, he arrived later on that night, around 12, Inguess that would be considered earlier the next morning. Anyway, Inwaited up for him; I didn't want to appear rude, my parents hadntaught me better than that. When I saw his car pull up I got reallynjittery and I started biting my nails, a nervous habit. I hadndecided to keep my uncle's visit a secret from my dad so that henwould not make me call my uncle and cancel. I needed help my dad andnI both knew it, we both hated accepting help; only problem was, I wasntired of living the way I was. Inhad no life at all. My life consisted of going to school, pickingnCharlie up from the babysitter and Allie up from daycare. After thatnwe would come home, Charlie would take a nap and Allie would donhomework or watch T.V., I would prepare dinner and do homework. Atnabout five, I would serve dinner, Charlie would be up from her nap sonshe would need to be fed and have some attention given. From aboutn5:00pm-8:00pm I got the girls ready for bed and at eight I put themnto bed. Usually, neither girl stayed asleep the whole night; Allienhad nightmares about mom and Charlie was a baby and baby's wake upnall the time. In between all of that, I had to do homework so I nevernhad time for anything else. I usually spent the weekends doing makeupnwork. Inwas hoping that with my uncle in the picture, maybe he would give usnsome extra money and we would be able to afford to have thenbabysitter and daycare provider care for the girls longer in the day,nmaybe till 5:30 or 6:00. I also hoped that my uncle might be able tonhelp my dad overcome his grief and depression and start being thenfather I knew he was and could be. Inheard my uncle's car door slam I jumped up from the table where Inwas doing some homework, groggily yet jittery, it's a horriblenfeeling; it's like your mind is tired but the rest of you won'tncalm down. I walked to the door, waited for him to ring the doorbellnor knock; when he did I answered it. Obviously, I had answered it waynto quickly because my uncle had a knowing smirk on his face, as if henknew I had been waiting right by the door for him to knock. My facenflushed red, one of my worst qualities, I turned away quickly so henwouldn't see and ushered him in. Hencame in slowly and I finally had a chance to look him up and down innthe light. The last time I had seen him Allie had been three, so Inhad been about six years old. He was a well built man just like mynfather, he had green blue eyes and his hair was a dark shade of blondnwith some gray specks thrown in, my uncle was a lot older than my ownnfather which accounted for the graying. He wasn't as tall as myndad, probably an inch or two shorter, 5'11-5'10, even thoughnthere were strong dissimilarities between my father and his oldernbrother, anyone would be able to tell that they were closely related. Hensmiled a smile I hadn't seen in a long time, it was almostnidentical to my father's smile, happy go lucky, toothy, charming,nand a little bit seductive. There was something different about hisnsmile but I wouldn't figure out what that was until later on. I wasnso glad to see someone who was sure of himself, happy and had mynfather's smile, a smile I had been missing for two long month'snnow. Inhad no clue what to say to this 'familiar' stranger so I justnstood there, he was the one who broke the silence. \"So, where'snmy little brother at?\" Inlooked at him, something about the way he was asking implied to menthat he knew that I hadn't told my dad that he was coming. \"He'snsleeping; he does that a lot now. You know since the-uh-accident.\" Mynuncle nodded his head. \"He doesn't know I am here does he?\" Inlooked at him in horror, embarrassment, anger and amazement. Hownhad he known? \"I didn't get the chance to tell him.\" Mynuncle smirked. \"Well, you better wake him up, I didn't come allnthis way for nothing now did I?\" Inshook my head in agreement, not sure what more I should say or do.nThen I slowly made my way to my dad's room. Mynfather is going to kill. No, scratch that, first he is going to chewnme out and then he is going to kill me. He is then going to chop menup into little pieces and scatter me throughout California. Insighed more out of embarrassment of what was to come than anythingnelse as I entered my dad's room. The only time my dad ever lookednlike his old self, peaceful and happy, was when he was asleep.nSometimes I would look in on him while he slept; it was the only waynthat I could see my old dad, the dad I missed, the dad I sondesperately wanted back. Ingot to my dad's side of the bed, I was a little disappointed tonwake him because gone would be his old self, just like that; kind ofnlike the way our old life had melted in to nothing in five seconds. Inshook my dad's shoulder gently and he woke up, I was startlednbecause usually he did not wake up that quick. \" Isnhe here yet?\" He asked in a groggily irritated voice. Indidn't know what he was talking about. Hencouldn't be talking about my uncle could he? He must still bendreaming. \" What?\"nI finally managed. \" Younheard me\" He said getting out of bed and pulling on his robe. \"Isnyour uncle here, is Steve, my brother here.\" He was talking to menlike I was slow or something and it stung but I was not going to letnhim know. \" Whyndon't you come see for yourself?\" I said with as little emotionnas possible. Hensighed, pushed his blond hair out of his face and started walkingntowards the living room. I got to the living room before my fathernwhich was a good thing because I was able to melt into the furniture,nat least for a little while. Myndad came out and I could tell by his face that he held anger towardsnmy uncle. \"What are you doing here?\" My father said somewhatnangrily. \" Yourndaughter, Arriella,\" The way he said my name made me cringe, henspat it out like he hated speaking it, like, if he kept it on hisntongue too long it would burn him like hot metal. \"called and askednme for help.\" Insaw my dad look over at me something like disgust was present on hisnface. At his look, I wanted to protest to what my uncle had said; Inhadn't asked for help, he had just sort of assumed that I needednit. I hadn't asked him to come here either, even if I needed hisnhelp, I hadn't expected or wanted him to come here. I decidednagainst protesting though because the truth of the matter was, I didnneed my uncle's help, I needed someone to intervene on my behalfnand I didn't want it to be the county or the state. \" Well,nmy daughter, Arriella,\" He said it mockingly and with anger andndisgust. I wasn't sure who it was directed at; my uncle or me. \"wasnmistaken, we are doing just fine.\" Whynwas he lying? We needed help; we needed money or an extra hand. Whynwouldn't he just admit it? Inwas angered by my father's denial more than anything, he could denynit but the proof was pretty much everywhere. The house for example, nwas a mess, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't keep everythingnclean. When mom had been alive each of us had had chores that we didnevery day during the week and then during the weekend we had extranchores, chores that didn't need to be done every day. I triednkeeping that tradition up but it failed. My father didn't seem carenand Allie didn't like chores when mom was alive so when I was inncharge, she simply refused and I couldn't do it all by myself. Mynuncle laughed at my father's comment. \"It doesn't look like shenis mistaken. Look at the house, look at her,\" He pointed to menthan, he was right too. I was pale and I had lost weight, people atnschool commented on it but everyone figured I was still grieving overnmy mother's death. \"Sophia would not have wanted her kids to livenlike this.\" Myndad flipped out when my uncle said that \"don't tell me what thenfuck my own wife would have wanted. You don't know a thing aboutnher; you did not give a shit about her. I don't even know why youncame here; you don't do anything that doesn't help yourself!\" Incringed at the words coming out of my dad's mouth; they werendripping with anger and hatred. I had never heard him talk or yell tonanyone like that before. When him and my mother got into fights, hendidn't sound like that, he was mostly just exasperated andnfrustrated. Mynuncle must have noticed his anger too, because he flinched a bit.n\"Look Jay, I came because my family is in need. If you don't wantnto accept that, fine, but you need to think; look around you, look atnyour girl, look at your house, look at you, eventually CPS is goingnto get involved and I know that Sop-you don't want that.\" Mynuncle didn't wait for a reply, he turned towards the front door andnstarted walking out, before he did though, he threw down some moneynon the coffee table. \"Get some food.\" Was all he said as he left. Incouldn't believe my dad had done that, I was pissed. I turnedntowards him, because I had been watching my uncle depart, and I sawnhim slouching on the black couch, he looked like a defeated man. Henput his face in his and rubbed his hands up and down his face as ifnhe was trying to drive away the shame or pain. \" DadnI-\" I stopped. What was I going to say, sorry? I wasn't sorrynthough and telling him that would only make him think that I was okaynwith how things were heading. Henlooked up and our eyes met, \"Ella, I- I think your uncle is right.nYou have been doing a lot. I don't want my girls being taken fromnme and that might happen, I have seen it happen before.\" He sighednthe realization of what he was about to say setting in. \"I don'tnknow what kind of help your uncle is willing to offer, but I think Inwill take it.\" Insmiled a bit. My dad must have caught it because he said \"Yournuncle isn't good news; don't think that this will come withoutnsome type of price.\" After he said this he got up from the couchn\"I'll go call him, he doesn't have a home phone just a cellnphone so the number you used should reach him.\" He walked off andnjust before he reached his room he said \"Elle baby, maybe younshould get some rest, you look tired.\" He entered his room and shutnthe door. Innodded in response to his question but I knew he hadn't seen it. ShouldnI go in and tell him that things will be okay? We can make it? Wenwill just get help from Steve for a bit and then we can do things onnour own again? Once dad got back on his feet again things wouldndefinitely be okay. I finally decided against it, he wouldn't want to hear my words ofncomfort, they wouldn't mean anything to him. Inwalked back into the kitchen, where all my homework was, I was goingnto do some more but I decided against it, I put it and went into mynroom. It was a beautiful bedroom, the furniture was a cherry oaknwhich had been my mom's favorite and mine too. There were ornatendesigns on it; designs that made the furniture appear really oldnfashioned. The furniture consisted of a headboard, a desk, which Inused on occasion but it was easier working in the kitchen, a dressernand a night stand. Mynparents had bought the furniture for me when I had turned twelve. Momnhad said that every maturing girl needed nice furniture. Mom had beennimpressed when I picked this set out \"It will grow with you.\" Shensaid. Thenbedding consisted of white sheets and pillows, and a white comforternwith lavender flowers. I jumped into bed, not even bothering to takenmy clothes off, and fell right asleep. I dreamed about my mom. Thatnnight would be one of the last nights that I dreamed about her. Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Inawoke the next morning to a low noise coming from my sister's room.nI looked up at the ceiling, trying to remember what had happened.nWhen I finally did the first thought that came to my mind was thingsnwere about to take a turn for the better, after two long months ofnbad, things were going to get better. Ingot out of bed, my body protesting the whole time, looking at thenalarm clock on my nightstand I realized it was only 8:00am, which wasnthe reason my body was protesting, I had only gone to bed 6 hoursnbefore. Wow,nthis is the first time in a long time that Charlie and Allie havenboth slept in so late. Atnthis thought I began to worry. Whatnif something has happened to them? What if some freaky man had brokennin last night and taken them or killed them? I practically ran to my sister's room, opened their door and sawnsomething I hadn't seen in a long time; My dad was in the rockingnchair, Allie was sitting on his left knee, his arm draped around her,nand Charlie was cradled in his right arm and he was singing a song tonthem; both girls were asleep. I was happy to see this but a pang ofnjealously stole through me. I was too old to sit on my dad's lapnbut before mom had died he used to bring the girls into my room, henwould sit on my bed and we would all cuddle while he sang. Getnover it I finally said thosendays are over. Myndad must have heard the door creak because he looked up \"HeynArriella, I made breakfast, eggs Benedict and orange juice. After Inwas done I came in here since there was nothing else to do, thought Inwould let you sleep.\" He smiled at me; it wasn't with his eyesnthough so I knew it was a forced smile. \" Oh\"nWas all I could muster. I missed my dad so much. I wanted him to wrapnhis arms around me and hold me, sing to me, and tell me it would benokay; but he could and never would be able to bring himself toncomfort his wife's murderer. Inwalked out and into the kitchen; I made myself a plate, I hadn'tnhad eggs Benedict in ages. I knew how to make it, I loved making it,nI loved cooking in general but these days I made things that wereneasiest, cheapest, and would please everyone. Insat down at the kitchen table, more out of habit than anything, mostnof the time the girls and I would eat wherever we felt mostncomfortable, mainly the living room in front of the television. Everyntime we did I thought of my mom and what she would have to sayn\"Arriella, did I raise you to be a T.V. fanatic? Gracie Bear thendestroyer of the American family\" Insighed and started eating. Gracie Bear had been my parents,nespecially my mothers, nickname for me. As I got older I hadn'tnliked her calling me it but she still did it, occasionally we wouldnget into fights about it; I would give anything to hear her sweet,nrich voice call me Gracie bear one more time. Infelt a tap on my shoulder and looked up to see my father standingnbehind me. \"What?\" I asked a little sharper than I had intended. \" Right\"nMy father said. \"Look Ella, I may have been a shit for a bit but Inam still your father and you will treat me with respect.\" Innodded my head \"Sorry\" I mumbled. \" Yeah,nlook, I will clean up here, you go get changed or whatever and then Inwant to talk to you about what your uncle had to say.\" \" Youncan tell me now.\" I said eagerly. Mynfather looked at me as if he was searching for something and thennshook his head \"No, go get changed and then I will tell you.\" Input my dish in the sink and went to my room, grabbed everything Inwould need to get dressed. I pretty much ran to the bathroom, took anshower as fast as I could, dried off, combed my hair, put on mynclothes and then walked into the living room. Myndad was sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in hisnhand, waiting for me; obviously I had taken longer than I hadnthought. I walked to the table and took a seat across from him. Inthen looked at him expectantly; he was supposed to be the bearer ofngood news, who would have expected that his news would be bad. \" Well,\"nHe said slowly, as if he was trying to mold his words carefully.n\"Your uncle will definitely help us but like I said, he won't donanything that doesn't benefit him somehow,\" He said this with ansardonic laugh. Mynheart fell to my stomach, I didn't know what my dad was going tonsay but I could tell it was going to be bad. \"yeah.\" I whispered. Indon't think my dad even heard me because he didn't look up fromnthe coffee mug that he was staring at, as if it would give him allnthe answers he was looking for and bring back his dead wife. \"Yournuncle wants us to come live with him in Long Beach. He says it willnbe the best way for him to help out. He can help me take care of younguys and at the same time he won't have to take time off of work ornanything. Basically, he will have an infinite amount of time to helpnus; any other way would be limited.\" Inlooked at my dad in complete shock; tears were threatening to pournforth from my eyes. \"I-but-I this is the house where all ournmemories of mom are.\" This was true too. We had moved into thisnhouse when I was two or three and had lived here ever since. It wasnthe family house; I could go to any room I wanted and remember mynmom, every room had a story to tell about my mother. Without it Inwould forget her, I wouldn't have the constant reminder. Mynfather looked at me with an iciness I had never seen him directntowards anyone except maybe his brother, last night, \"You called,nyou deal with the consequences, that's his offer.\" Inwanted to scream at my father then comfortnme, hug me like when I was a little girl, tell me it will be allnright, tell me we don't need a stupid house to remember her, tellnme we just need each other and our love for her. Tell me something,ndon't hate me, and don't turn away from me. Let me be your littlengirl again. The little girl that you greeted with a hug after worknand would tickle with your mustache just because you knew it annoyednme and made me laugh at the same time. \" Whatnabout work, for you?\" Mynfather laughed at this. \"Don't worry baby daddy won't be anloser if that's what your worried about. Your uncle told me and Inalready knew; that the Long Beach police department is hiringndetectives, I guess one of their detectives decided to retire, Stevenseems to think I can get the job.\" Inlooked at my dad and I smiled sadly \"I guess we have to do it thenndon't we? You obviously can't take care of us and I am only anchild?\" I saw something like hurt flash through his eyes. Good Inthought maybe you're feeling a little bit of what I have been feeling. ThennI said something that I will always regret \"I wonder what mom wouldnthink of you now?\" I cringed inwardly when I said it, I knew it wasna horrible thing to say but I wanted to hurt him like he hurt me andnI knew mentioning mom, especially mom's possible disappointment innhim, would hit the spot. Indidn't take the time to see how badly I hurt him; I got up andnstarted walking to my room \"When do we leave?\" \" Werenstill discussing it.\" My dad said in a defeated voice. Innodded my head, walked to my room, lay down on my bed and criednsilent tears. I hurt my father and I hated it, but I hated him morenfor hurting me. Whyncouldn't he just forgive me? I had killed my mother, I knew thatnand I would have to live with that, wasn't that enough? Did I alsonhave to live with losing my father? ooooooooooooooooooooooooo Incried so long that day, dad took care of the girls, which was a plus,nand for the first time in around two months I got to spend timenalone. The time I spent alone wasn't the fun I imagined myn'freedom' would be, but at least I got to grieve. I grieved fornall the wrong things though. I grieved for the loss of a house, thenloss of memories and the loss of 'life as I knew it' but at leastnI grieved for something since my mom's death. Afternan hour of sitting and crying in complete silence, I grabbed mynportable CD player/walkman and put in a CD. It was Lynyrd Skynyrd,none of the best bands in the world, definitely not the best but closenenough. They happened to be my mom's favorite band; her and my dadnused to 'argue' about that, he used to say 'hands down LednZepplin was the best band' she would laugh, muss his hair, which henhated but tolerated from her, and say 'nah baby, I gotta saynSkynyrd is the best.\" Inused to laugh at my parents antics when I was younger but as I gotnolder I started putting in my own two sense 'mom' I would say inna mock annoyed voice, \"Zepplin is by far superior to Skynyrd.' Myndad would high five me and my mom would mutter 'traitor'. Thatnalways caused us to laugh hysterically; sometimes we would laugh sonhard, that, if we were in the car, the people next to us would looknat us as if we had all just escaped from the loony bin. It was great. Mynparents had bought me Lynyrd Skynyrd's greatest hits for my twelfthnbirthday. It had all their best songs on it; song's like Sweet homenAlabama, Freebird, Call me the breeze, and so many more. I put in onenof the three CD's and skipped ahead to one of my all time favoritenLynyrd Skynyrd songs. Freebird. Thenmelody was great, yearning and sadness all rolled up into one. Itnreminded me of how I felt every day of my life. The words drifted out IfnI leave here tomorrow Wouldnyou still remember me FornI must be traveling on now ' causenthere's too many places I gotta to see Evennthough the song was basically about a guy that wanted to get out of anrelationship because he wanted to be free and travel the world itnreminded me of myself. I so desperately wanted to be free. But, if Inleft would my sisters remember me? Would they hate me? Love me? Havenmixed emotions? I had always dreamt about seeing the world and onndays when I was so stressed out, I just felt like walking out of mynhouse and never coming back. Causenthere's too many places I gotta to see. Butnif I stayed here with you girl Thingsnjust couldn't be the same CausenI'm as free as a bird now Andnthis bird you cannot change Lordnknows I can't change Ohohohohohoh Andnthe bird you know cannot change Andnthis bird you cannot change Lordnknows I can't change Whennmy mom had been alive I had tasted freedom and loved it. I did notnhave to take care of my sisters, I always helped my mom because Inwanted to, because I loved her and I knew at times she got stressednhaving three kids so I wanted to help lighten the load. I had hadndreams when she was alive though, I had wanted to go to college andndo something good with my life, neither of my parents had gone toncollege and I wanted to make them happy. I had other dreams too.nHowever, my mom died and I am caged now, without her things cannot benthe same, but all the dreams I had haven't gone away, lordnknows I can't change. ByenBye, baby it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah Thoughnthis feeling I can't change Butnplease don't take it so badly ' causenlord knows I'm to blame Inknew, eventually, I would leave my family and it would be anbittersweet moment, it was inevitable, every child left homeneventually. My concern, however, was whether or not I would leave onngood terms; as time went by my heart grew colder and colder towardsnmy father and I knew, if I left home on bad terms with my father Inwould hardly see my sisters and the truth of the matter was, mynsisters were the most important people to me. If I ended up losingncontact with my sister's I would be to blame because I had killednmy mom, I was selfish, I couldn't give up my dreams and just letnwhat was to happen, happen. Every single day of my life, the onenthing that kept me going was the fact that soon enough I will be outnof here, away from dad. I am a restless soul who wants to experiencenthe world and not even the fact that, if I leave my sisters will benwithout a mother, has quieted that. Butnif I stayed here with you girl Thingsnjust couldn't be the same CausenI'm as free as a bird now Andnthis bird you cannot change Lordnknows I can't change Ohohohohohoh Andnthe bird you know cannot change Andnthis bird you cannot change Lordnknows I can't change Lordnhelp me I can't change LordnI can't change (Indo not own this song or anything that has to do with it…) Thensong ended and I had tears in my eyes, that song had never effectednme so much but I guess I never really understood it. Even though thencircumstances were different being caged is never fun, and a personndoes not like it and the thoughts of freedom that plague their mindnnever leave the person completely. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Incontinued listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd, I had been listening to them anlot lately, just to be reminded of my mother. When the song SweetnHome Alabama came on I started thinking about my new 'home'. Bothnmy parents had originally come from Long Beach but neither of themntalked about it much. Whenever I had asked what it was like theynwould say \"Oh it was nice but Fresno is way nicer\" and quicklynchange the subject. I never really understood this because everyonenknew Long Beach was a pretty nice place, in some places at least. Inknew my parents were trying to hide things about their past from menbut I never knew what. Both my parents seemed pretty square to me. Myndad was a cop and my mom worked at the supermarket when we kids werenin school. Neither of them did drugs, of course, they occasionallynhad a glass of wine but they had never abused it untilnmy mom died I thought to myself thenndad became a closet alcoholic. Itnwas a known fact that they had had me before marriage. Ohnmy. I thought sarcastically. But I couldn't think what they wanted tonhide from me. They would never take me or when Allie came along,nanywhere near long beach. We lived in California all our lives and wennever once had been to Disneyland. Whatna shame I thought sadly. Mom had been trying to talk dad into taking us shenhad said \"Gracie is almost 14 and she hasn't been yet, if wenlived in another state that might not be a big deal but come on babynwe live in the same state and we live Six hours away.\" Dadnhad always been a sucker for mom, especially when she gave him hernpuppy dog look, I had actually mastered that looked over the years,n\"Soph baby I- What about all the shit that happened back then?\"nMy parents hadn't known I was there or they wouldn't have beenntalking about it. \" Baby,nDisneyland is in Anaheim and Long Beach is a long way from there. Wendon't have to worry about it. Besides, dad called and said all thatnshit is over.\" That had surprised me because I had always thoughtnmy parents didn't have fathers, neither talked about them. \" Okay,nthis summer, since Ella is going into high school we will go.\" Momnhad clapped her hands together like a little girl and jumped up andndown on the bed, I smiled too, I was finally going to go tonDisneyland. Of course that never happened and it never would. Ohnwell, shit happens. Insighed and rolled over on my side MaybenI will finally figure out what my parents were hiding from me? Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Inmust have fallen asleep because I awoke to a small hand shaking menawake. I rolled over, opened my eyes and looked at my sister, AllisonnBianca Schroeder, Allie for short. She had dirty blond hair just likenmy father, she was chunky, she got made fun of for being fat and Intold her \"One day you will show them Allie, you are going to bengorgeous and they are going to wish that they hadn't said anythingnto you.\" She didn't believe me but I think it's true, my dadnwas a chunky child and one day he lost all his 'baby fat' andnbecame one of the handsomest men around; or so sayeth the othernmothers. She was basically an exact replica of my father except shenhad my mother's beautiful golden brown eyes. Inlooked at her for a minute not comprehending why she was waking menup. \"What?\" I finally choked out. \" Daddyntold me to come wake you up. He said we are going out to dinner withnsome man to talk about the future.\" She said everything sonprecisely that I knew she had rehearsed my father's exact words thenwhole way down the hall. \" Okay.\"nI said. \"What should I wear?\" Shenshrugged her shoulders, pointed to her own casual outfit and said \"Wenare just going to that Chinese place.\" Innodded my head in understanding and she left. I got out of bed, wentnover to my closet, searched around for an outfit, found one, a blackntank top with fake jewels in the back that were shaped like angelnwings and khaki pants. I combed my hair and put on some makeup; I putnmy makeup on just the way my mom taught me, just enough so peoplenknew you had some on but not too much so that you appeared as thoughnyou didn't know how to wear makeup. After mom had died, I had sortnof taken over her make-up at first it had been weird but then I gotnused to it and I felt like I had even more of her close to me. Inlooked at myself in the mirror real quick just to make sureneverything was okay, it was, and I looked again, stuck my tongue outnat myself and mumbled \"Ugly\" and walked out of my room into thenliving room. WhennI got into the living room I saw my dad take in a deep breath and Inrealized he still hadn't gotten over what I had said this morning.nI shrugged my shoulders and said \"Ready?\" Myndad nodded his head \"You look good Elle. I-uh you look so much likenyour mom.\" Inlaughed inwardly at that, I couldn't look like my mom could I? Therenwas a floor length mirror in our living room, it was supposed to gonin my parents room but dad never got the chance to put it in there; Intried to, as inconspicuously as possible, glance at myself in thenmirror and when I did I saw my mom staring back at me. My breathncaught and I couldn't breathe. Last time I looked at myself in thenmirror all I had seen was an awkward teenager, now I saw my mom.nThick, luscious, beautiful, dark chocolate brown hair, naturally tannskin, and full lips that a lot of girls would be jealous of. Ofncourse, I was still in that awkward teenage stage, my body was a bitngangly but I was slowly beginning to see the curves that I had sondesperately wanted. The only difference that existed between mynmother and I, and would never go away, was our eye color, my mothernhad beautiful golden brown eyes whereas I had my father's pool blueneyes. Forna minute I didn't know what to say, everyone had always told me hownsimilar I looked to my mother but I had never believed them butnobviously it was true. Finally I spoke \"She was way prettier butnthanks. Are we ready to go?\" Dadnsmiled, held up baby Charlie's car seat and said \"Yep.\" oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Wenarrived at the restaurant twenty minutes later. It was a beautifulnrestaurant with ornate Chinese designs; it was one of the onlynrestaurants that was extremely beautiful and at the same time it wasnacceptable to dress casually. Myndad grabbed Charlie out of the car seat and I helped Allie out of thencar. We all walked into the restaurant, with the exception ofnCharlie, and ran straight into my uncle. \" Indecided to wait to get a table. I wasn't sure if you would bringneveryone or what.\" Myndad grunted, Allie hid behind my legs, Charlie smiled up at him and Innodded my head and said \"Thanks.\" I had no clue if that was thencorrect response but it was obvious it was the only response he wasngoing to get. My uncle motionednfor the waitress, indicating we were ready to be seated. She camenover and told us to follow her, which we did. We were seated by anwindow, which was good because it would keep the baby occupied; shenloved looking outside at the birds and what not. The waitress set ornmenus down and left. I pretended tonlook at the menu because I could sense the tension; it was obviousnthat my dad was still angry with my uncle, even though he hadnaccepted the offer. \" Soooo\" Mynuncle finally said, putting a stop to the silence that had beenntaking over. I looked up fromnmy menu, my dad did the same and Allie, who was intent on getting thenlemon seed out of her water, looked up as well. My uncle smiledn\"Well, I guess you talked to Arriella about the circumstances?\"nMy dad shook his head and so did I. \"Okay, and she obviouslynagreed. Well, we need to talk about our options, pertaining to whennyou all come to live with me.\" I lookednworriedly at Allie but realized her attention had fallen back tongetting the lemon seed out of her cup of water. Neither my dad nor Inhad explained to her that we would be leaving our house. I knew shenwould take the news hard because after mom had died all she had saidnthe first couple weeks was \"at least we have the house and thenmemories that exist of her there.\" It was kind of a weird thing fornher to say but doctors had said that sometimes young children clingnto special things of their dead parent and the house had beennextremely special to my mom. My dad looked atnmy uncle like he was an idiot. \"What do you mean? We wait till Insell the house and get the job.\" My uncle lookednat my dad with annoyance. \"That's one option but then the kidsnwill not be adjusted to life in a new community. It will take ancouple months for the house to sell and you to get the job. I wasnthinking the kids could come live with me until everything getsnsettled and then when everything is settled you could come and staynwith us as well.\" I looked from myndad to my uncle, the look on my dad's face clearly showed that henthought this was a good idea, and I was in a state of disbelief. Thenlongest I had ever been away from either of my parents had been onennight, when I went to a friend's sleepover, and that night had beennhell. I couldn't believe my dad was actually considering this; henhad never liked being separated from us and now, all of a sudden hencouldn't wait to get rid of us. If I went to stay with my uncle whonwas to say my dad would even come? Lately, he had been going out tonbars and not coming home till morning, this might be just what henneeded to abandon us for good. \" You can't benserious?\" I finally stated. My dad looked atnme and a look of puzzlement, annoyance and worry crossed through hisneyes. \"I think it is a good idea. We will be living with your unclenfor a couple months, at least, and it would be a good idea for you tonget to know him. I originally wanted to wait till you finished schoolnbut your uncle brought up a good point, you not adjusting to your newnsurroundings would suck, this way you will adjust to everything andnespecially your uncle. You and your sister's won't be without menlonger than a few months, three or four at the most.\" I looked at himnand then it clicked \"This was all a show wasn't it? You knew Inwould call Steve, you knew I couldn't handle it anymore; you knewnall this was going to happen. Why are you doing this? Why won't younjust move on? People die and you have to get over it! Get over it,nshe is dead and she is never coming back!\" Paranoidnmuch? I thought to myself. Fuck,nmaybe I am a dissociative junkie, when I get out of here I reallynneed to check my arms and make sure that they don't have any tractnmarks on them. Atnmy words anger flashed through my dad's eyes, the thing aboutnhaving emotional outbursts is never have them when someone else is onnthe verge of having one too, especially when that someone is thenperson you are taking your anger out on. \"You think that I haven'tntried to forget? I have! But I can't and I don't think I evernwill. I miss your mother so much and I am so tired of you and yournstubborn ways. Damn it Ella, when you get like this I just think hownfucked up it is that things didn't turn out differently. That shenwas the one to die and not-\" Inlooked at my father and I felt tears coming to the surface. He hadnfinally said it; he had finally admitted that he wished I would havenbeen the one to die. \" Ella,\"nMy dad said in a pleading voice. \"I didn't mean it like that, Inmeant- ButnI stood up and walked away. \"It doesn't matter\" I said over mynshoulder. \"We all know how you feel, we have all known it for anlong time and it doesn't matter because it wasn't me and we can'tnchange that.\" I said the last part in a whisper and walked out ofnthe restaurant. I heard my dad calling my name but I ignored him,ntears were streaming down my face and I couldn't bear to let himnsee them, he didn't deserve to see the pain he had caused me, hendidn't deserve the chance to comfort me. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Inwalked around town for hours, listening to my portable CDnplayer/walkman. I had always known, deep down, that my father hadnwished that it had been me who had died. I knew that if my fatherncould go back and change the events of that night he would have savednmy mom instead of me. When the accident occurred, I looked worse offnthan my mom so my dad pulled me out of the car first; he had to donCPR and everything. Because of me he never got a chance to take anlook at my mom, if he had, he might have been able to stop thenbleeding, he might have been able to help her start breathing again. Whennthe sun started setting I knew it was time to go home. Fresno is andecent little town, but it is definitely not a place you want to benout at night, alone, especially when you are a young kid. The walknhome took a good twenty minutes and I was dreading it the whole time.nPart of me just wanted to never go home, become one of thosenstatistics you read about in the newspapers, a run away, but I knewnthat was stupid and I was not into doing anything stupid; I was wayntoo tired for stupid. WhennI got to my block, I saw my uncle's ford explorer loaded up withnall sorts of shit. Obviouslyntoday's events hadn't delayed my 'fathers' decision. Inwalked up to my uncle's ford explorer, looked inside and noted thatnsome of Charlie's crib was inside the rest of her crib was on thentop. I sighed heavily and walked into the house. Myndad is probably going to yell at me for being gone for so long. Ingot inside and my uncle was the first one to notice me \"Arriella,\"nHe said firmly \"Your father wanted me to tell you to pack yournthings and not to make a fuss. You and your sister's will benleaving with me as soon as possible.\" \" I-Inhe isn't here\" Mynuncle looked at me with his smile that reminded me of my father butnat the same time was different, \"He thought it would be easier onneveryone if he wasn't here. Now go get packed. You will neednclothes, bedding and the like.\" Innodded my head, more out of confusion than anything else. I walkedninto my room. I started gathering everything that I figured I wouldnneed. Clothes, makeup, nick nacks, bedding, shampoo, toothpaste etc.nI was almost done packing I just needed to grab something out of myndesk drawer. I reached in and sitting on top of everything was anpackage and on top of the package was an envelope. Scrawled in mynfather's handwriting was Arriella. Inreluctantly ripped open the envelope and read what my father had tonsay: Arriella, Inwanted to wait till your birthday to give you this stuff but Indecided that now was the best time. Your mother and I couldn'tnbelieve how fast you were growing up and we didn't want you tonforget that you would always matter to us and you would always be ournGracie Bear. We got this specially made for you a couple monthsnbefore your mother died and the jeweler called recently to tell menthat it was ready. I debated on whether or not to pick it up but Inknew that your mother would have wanted you to have it and I knew younwould want to have a lasting memory of your mother. Dad. Inopened the package and inside was a red jewelry box. I opened itngingerly and gasped when I saw what was inside, it was the mostnbeautiful jewelry set I had ever seen. It was a white gold necklacenwith a heart dangling from it and on the heart was a small diamond.nThere was a matching pair of earrings, although the heart on thosenwas much smaller, and a bracelet. I immediately went to put thenbracelet on and I caught a glimpse of something on the back of thenheart. I was a little worried because I thought it was a scratch butnI looked closer and saw \"Gracie Bear\" had been etched on it. Thisnmade me extremely curious so I looked on the back of the necklace andnsaw \"Always our\" I smiled at this; it was a shortened version ofnwhat mom had always told me. \"You will always be our Gracie bear,nwe will always love our Gracie bear no matter what.\" Incried then and rummaged through the package because I realized therenwas more. There was another envelope in it which I opened. It wasnanother letter from dad. Arriella, Do notnlet your uncle get his hands on any of the jewelry in the nextnpackage. I already told him he was not to take the jewelry you justnreceived. The stuff in the next package is not so safe though. Thenjewelry that is in there is everything your mother ever wanted younand your sisters to have; it is separated by name and everything. Incan't explain why I am giving you all of this stuff now but it isnimportant that I do because I might not see you guys again. You maynnot want to believe me, but I am not a horrible person, I am justnlost and I do want what is best for you. I don't know if your unclenis the best thing for you but I know he will take care of you for thentime being. Your uncle is not the savior you believe him to so pleasenbe careful of him, that is all I ask. I willncome to you and your sisters as soon as possible but as a sort ofn'payment' for letting us live with him, your uncle has asked mento do something for him and therefore I have to go away for a while. If I donnot make it back and things get crazy with your uncle call thisnnumber 555-6262 and tell the person who answers that Jay gave you thennumber. Tell your sisters I love them and will not forget them. Ella,nplease forgive me and don't be too much of a freebird because Incould never handle not seeing you. Dad. Inlooked at the letter; it made no sense at all. My uncle had asked himnto do a job? What was that? The letter touched my heart because Inknew in my heart my dad had been trying to apologize but why hadn'tnhe said it to my face? I reread the letter and laughed a little atnthe freebird part because in a way it proved that my dad still knewnme. It was kind of confusing though, what had my dad been saying? Wasnhe telling me that it was okay to break free from the 'cage' Infelt like I was in sometimes? But that I shouldn't forget who I wasnand where I belonged? Infolded the paper up and took the package my dad had given me and hidnit as good as I could with my stuff, hopefully my uncle wasn't ansnoop. While I was hiding the package, something slipped out of itsnfolds and I looked and realized it was a wad of money; attached tonthe money was a note and all it said was 'just in case'. I feltnreally weird about all this but I couldn't protest to any of itnnow, my dad was gone now and I was now in my uncle's care. Inlooked around my room one last time and wondered what would happen tonmy beautiful furniture and the house that had been a home for sonlong. I sighed deeply, turned the light off, was plunged intondarkness and left. Inmet my uncle at the front of the house and he had that familiar smilenon his face and for the first time I realized what was differentnabout it; it had viciousness to it and it was also calculating. Itnwas all the things my father's smile was but it had a monstrousnside to it that my father's smile could never accomplish. Inshivered silently and walked with my uncle to the car. Thisnis not going to be good at all. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Okay,nthis chapter has gotten extremely long and I know I for one hatenreading long chappie's. The next chapter will be up soon or Inwouldn't have ended it here. Anyway,nI hope you people are enjoying this story. I know I am. I wanted tongive background on Arriella and I figured this would be a good placento start. It wasn't supposed to get so extremely long. I hope it isnsomewhat gripping and cliffhangerish. Also, the next chappie will hitnon the point of the whole flashback (which was not just to give somenbackground to my character). Also,nthis is supposed to be a romance but it is more than that so I don'tnknow 100% when the romantic parts will come but I will try to addnsome flashbacks or something. Ifnanyone wants to see something specific in this story you can tell menand I will try to add it. I cannot promise that I will be able to addnit but I will try. I mean, you might want to see some moreninteraction between Arriella and so and so or something like thatn(Etc) and I will definitely try to comply but sometimes things don'tnwork out the way they are supposed to. Please…please…please…reviewnI love getting reviews and since this is a new story I would reallynlike to get some reviews and see what ya all think. I don't know,nright now I am really into this story so reviews won't make andifference on whether or not I continue writing but reviews are niceneither way…so please…please…please…please…review![Chapter 3] Hey Guys, So it has been an extremely long time since I have updated any of my stories and there is a reason for that! I had a number of chapters already written up for many of my stories, mainly my Four Brothers, Charmed and Gone In 60 Seconds. However, my computer got a virus or something and a number of my files were deleted and that included my stories, unfortunately. Also, the USB drive that I had my stories saved to got lost. Due to that I just did not feel like rewriting the lost chapters. I had pretty much lost all motivation and couldn't seem to find it. Also, combine that with some personal things that had been going on in my life and bam I had major writers block, lack of motivation and I just didn't even know if I would ever log onto Fanfiction again. I must say that a number of things have changed though. Throughout the course of my hiatus I continued to get a few reviews on my stories which reminded me of my stories and reminded me of my love for writing. Things in my life are still rather messed up and I am still struggling but through struggles come the best of writing. I admit that I came up with most of my story ideas when I was struggling the most and I want to get back into the writing especially the three stories that I mentioned since those are the ones that I have the most love for. It is very likely that you will see an update for my Gone In 60 Seconds story. I had five chapters written before everything got lost (although this story will probably be much longer) and it consisted of a number of flashbacks and then I was slowly starting to get into the present. I have to figure out how to rewrite those five chapters. I think I can do it because I have the story pretty much completely mapped out in my head. However, before taking this up I wanted to make sure that I did not lose the characters etc. Anyway, I cannot guarantee how long it will take for the chapter/chapters to be updated because I am also busy with school and the last five weeks are here and so I have final papers and final tests etc. But, I will be taking a bit of time to write the chapter. The next update you should be seeing is my Charmed story and the reason for this is because it has less chapters than my Four Brothers stories and so I have to take some time to reacquaint myself with the Four Brothers story before I go about writing it. I've started re-reading my four brothers story and am on chapter 7 or 8 so eventually I will be up to speed at what direction it has taken. Obviously I have the story written out it my head but when it is written down on 'paper' it is a tad bit differ so reacquainting ones self with the work is best. Anyway, this is the plan and it should not change too much except for, possibly, the order of the updates. I have found writing to be therapeutic and this is something I need to do for myself and I know when I was writing these stories it was really beneficial. Anyway, to the future I suppose. And, once I get more of these stories completed I am hoping that you will see some other stories. I am also hoping that you will see my writing has improved since my last updates although I must admit I do not proof read my stories because I do not find it to be that important. While I am hoping my newer stuff will not have as many mistakes as my older stuff I find stressing about grammar is for school which I do excessively.[Chapter 4] Author's note: I have been wanting to get something up for a while so I thought I'd give it a try. This is the primary story that I'll be working on but I'll need to re-watch the movie at some point and I don't currently own it. I can probably get a few more chapters written before then though. Also, I want to say that geography might not be accurate in this. I live in California but I have only been to the LA area like three times total and I was rather young. Therefore, if anything is not accurate you can point it out for future chapters or you can just go with it. Lastly, like I said in previous chapters, I had five chapters written for this and then lost them. I got kind of discouraged about writing the chapters over after that and so I just stopped writing. Not sure how often I'll post to this story but I'd like to get one of my stories completely finished and this is the one I like best. Kind of lost my ability to write though so I don't think these will be all that good. The ride to Long Beach took longer with a baby and I could tell that my uncle was getting impatient. I did what I could to calm Charlie down but she needed some time outside of the car. We took a pit stop at a dinner and ate. I fed Charlie and my uncle seemed annoyed with the mess that she was making. I asked my uncle how much longer we had till we were there and he said about an hour. I was thankful for that. The hour seemed to pass in no time at all even though Charlie was fussy. My uncle's house was a quaint three bedroom. We all got out and headed inside. I was a little nervous since I hadn't spent much time alone with my uncle before. He showed us the room that would be ours and while it was a tad bit cramped I knew we'd make it work. I figured we'd get a bunk bed at some point and Charlie could sleep with me until she was old enough to occupy the bunk bed. I rocked Charlie back and forth because I could tell she was tired. There was only one bed in the room and I figured Charlie could sleep there along with Allie. Eventually Charlie fell asleep and I put her in bed with pillows all around so she wouldn't roll off. I turned to Allie and could tell she was tired as well. \"Why don't you put your pajama's on?\" I could tell Allie felt kind of uncomfortable about that but she did it anyway. I sang her a song and watched her drift off to sleep. After the girls fell asleep I went out into the living room. I felt really uncomfortable about being alone with my uncle but I figured that I needed to show him respect. However, I should have just gone to sleep. \" Uncle Steve\" I called. \" What?\" He called back. \" Just looking for you because the girls fell asleep and I wanted to thank you for taking us in.\" My uncle came out of one of the rooms and looked me up and down. I could tell there was something on his mind but I wasn't sure what. It wouldn't take long for him to let me know what it was. \" Look,\" he said. \"I am not offering you a free place to stay. If you want food and shelter you have to pay your own way. I know that might be new to you since your parents spoiled you rotten but growing up I had to pay my own way as did your father.\" I was baffled by what he was saying. \"What do you mean? How do you want me to do that?\" I had no idea how I was supposed to get a job at 14. It might be possible to do some babysitting for other families but I wasn't even sure about that. \" I have a few ideas in mind.\" My uncle said. \" Here's the thing, I know ways to make extra cash and I'll have someone teach you. If you end up not being able to do it then you and your family can find somewhere else to stay.\" I started getting nervous then. I could tell I wasn't going to like what my uncle had planned. \"Yeah, I can do that. But, what is it.\" \" Well, there's a profit in stealing cars. I've gathered a team that does it for me and we split the money. I want you to do it too and then we'll split the money as well. I get 80% and you get 20%. Seems like a fair deal to me. That 80% will cover room and board for your whole family.\" My jaw was dropped at that. Not only was he trying to make me steal cars, he was also wanting to take more than half. My uncle, who happened to be a cop himself was telling me that he took part in stealing cars. \"I-uh-what if I don't want to?\" I asked nervously. The thing about my uncle was that he didn't seem like the type of person you said no too. \" Like I said, if you don't do it your family can find somewhere else to live. I'll give you a week to get it together and then you'll have to leave.\" I was infuriated now. He was gonna kick us out when we had no way of getting anywhere. I remembered the number my dad had given me and had told me to call if anything went wrong. I was contemplating calling it when my uncle reached out and hit me hard in the gut. I doubled over and tried catching my breath. I had no idea why he was doing this. \" Look,\" my uncle said. \"You can say yes and make it go easy or you can say no and I'll make sure your life is a living hell. It's really up to you. I'll give you a few days to think about it.\" He walked away after that leaving me gasping for air. After I recovered from the punch to my gut I retreated to my room. I didn't know what I was going to do and I realized I didn't have access to a phone. Later in the evening when it seemed like my uncle was asleep I snuck out into the living room to use the phone. I was nervous about it but I needed to find a way to get us out of here. I got to the phone and was getting ready to dial the number when \"What are you doing?\" I looked up and caught my uncle out of the corner of my eye. I didn't know what to say so I just stood there dumbfounded. \"Your dad gave you a number didn't he?\" I was going to deny it when my uncle said \"Don't try lying to me. I know whose number he gave you and why. I can tell you that if you call that person I'll have them arrested in no time. It's easy to plant evidence on someone. It's easy to be a step ahead of your father as well. He's not the least bit creative.\" I sighed. I didn't know if I should believe my uncle but I didn't want to take the chance that some person I didn't really know would get in trouble because of me. I put the phone down and started walking to my room. \"It doesn't have to be difficult Arie. Boosting cars is actually fun and rewarding for a lot of people. I think you'd enjoy it.\" I walked back to the room without a word. My uncle had gotten his way and I had gotten into boosting cars. I met Jake through my uncle and had gotten lessons in boosting cars from him. I met Kip and the guys relatively soon after that and the only one in our gang who knew how big of an asshole my uncle was Mirror Man. I mean, the guys knew my uncle wanted money for us staying there but they didn't realize the extent of it. When Mirror man found out I made him swear he wouldn't tell Kip. Charlie ended up climbing into bed with me even though she had to get up relatively soon for school. I laid there with her. It was one of the most peaceful things in the world even though I was really struggling with everything that had gone on. My mind was racing and I was worried about Kip. I knew once I got Charlie off to school I would have to make some calls. Earlier I noticed that Allie wasn't in bed and I was going to have to talk to her about that. Sneaking off and leaving Charlie alone in the house with Uncle Steve was unacceptable. Cuddling with Charlie did help ease my mind but before I knew it the alarm clock went off and it was time to get her dressed for school. I was in a pretty big hurry to get her dropped off so that I could make the necessary calls. However, Charlie had other ideas. \"Arie, please let me stay home today. I hate school.\" I knew she had been bullied at school but letting her skip wasn't gonna accomplish anything. We fought a lot of mornings about her going to school. I sighed and told her that the weekend would be here soon enough and then she'd have two days free from school. That seemed to help a little bit and she got dressed. We were out the door soon after that. When I got home from dropping her off I picked up the phone and dialed Jake's number. I was nervous about making this call but I knew it had to be done. The phone was ringing and ringing and just when I thought there wasn't going to be an answer I heard \"Hello\" \"Jake\" I said \"It's Arie, I need your help.\" I started to explain the situation but Jake cut me off. \"I heard about what happened and I can't help. I don't want to get involved in something like that and I know for a fact your uncle wouldn't want me getting involved either.\" I sighed \"Please Jake, this is really important. I am worried about Kip.\" \"I get that but it doesn't change my decision. I won't get involved and you really should have thought more about getting involved. Your uncle isn't going to be happy about this.\" I was getting angry. Who cared about my uncle. \"You're condemning someone to death Jake. You know Calitri will not let this slide.\" \"I realize that but it really isn't my problem. Talk to your uncle about what to do. I am sure he'll be thrilled to know you disobeyed him regarding Kip.\" \"I didn't disobey him. I needed the money. Fuck Jake, come on. Do this for me.\" \"No. That's my final decision.\" I sighed \"Thanks a lot Jake. I guess I'll ask someone else.\" \"You can try but no one is going to bite. You and your friends are screwed.\" I hung up on Jake after that and threw the phone across the room. \"Fuck.\" I screamed. Jake was right. No one else would take this on. I had called Jake in hopes that our supposed friendship would lead him to help but he was more worried about doing something that would upset my uncle. \"Fuck!\" I said again. \"Fuck, fuck, fuck!\" A few tears started coming down. I might have broken up with Kip but that didn't mean I had stopped loving him. \"What are you crying about?\" I heard. I looked up and my uncle was standing in the doorway. \"I suppose your crying over the incident with Calitri. Didn't I fucking tell you to stay away from that boy.\" This is as much as I can write today. I have to get the movie before I can continue. I might actually have it somewhere. I also have to get a copy of the screenplay. Or, I'd like to if it's at all possible. Thanks for reading! I know it's not very good though. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Don't own any of the characters or the main plot of the movie. If I did…I would be Jerr"},{"Movie":"Serenity","Title":"Dear Diary","Author":"Loonyloops","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10872478","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N This is an updated version of the story I posted last year. It is still very much the same. However, I have added a little more to the story, as well as page breaks. The following publication is from a diary found near a school in the Eastern Plains District on the northern continent of the planet Miranda. The inscription in the front of the diary says it belonged to a young girl named Emmeline Crumb. She received this diary for her twelfth birthday, just two days before the release of the PAX. It was a gift from her Aunt Emma. Research has revealed that Emmeline was named after her paternal aunt Emma Crumb-Black of Terra 3. Please keep in mind the disturbing nature of the events on Miranda as you read the last days of that planet as recorded by Emmeline in her new diary. Dear Diary, I am so happy I have you. I can't wait to tell you all about what happens around here. I had a really great birthday party and got lots of great presents. It's really late and I have to get up early in the morning so I won't tell you all of them right now. I don't mind not telling you much now because we will have forever. Goodnight, Emmeline P.S. I'm going to write Aunt Emma and tell her I love my birthday present from her. Dear Diary, I'm not exactly sure what I should write, so I will just tell you a little bit about me for now. My name is Emmeline Crumb. My brother is Emmett. He is two years older than me. My parents' names are Emil and Evelyn. Yeah, we all have E names. I think it is kind of neat. It makes us different from all the other families. My best friends are June Sung and Macie Waters. We have known each other forever. We all live on the same street across from a huge playground. We go to there a lot. That is where we met and we keep hanging out there. On the other side of the playground is the school we go to. It is made almost all of glass. I think it is really pretty. My mom owns a diner on the other side of the district called Evelyn's. She made all the recipes and is always working, but she still likes to cook for us at home too. Dad is an engineer. He works for the Alliance. Tomorrow we are going to the park over by the diner to watch the PAX deployment. I wore my new clothes that I got for my birthday to school today. Macie and June liked the blue color of my skirt. They said it matches my eyes. I didn't tell them, but I was hoping Bobby Redman would like it too, but he sat on the other side of the room and didn't see me. Well, I'm tired. Now you know a little more about me and I know a little bit more about how to talk to you. We are going to be the best of friends. Goodnight, Emmeline P.S. I wrote a thank you letter to Aunt Emma. She should get it next week. Dear Diary, Today is the day. Mom says the Alliance is going to help make Miranda better. I don't know how. I think it is already pretty good, but Mom and Dad say I am too young to know any different. They are so dumb. Of course I know stuff. Just because they don't think I do doesn't mean I don't. I know that the PAX is supposed to make all the crime go away. There isn't much crime here, so I don't know why they are releasing it here. It doesn't matter though because we get out of school today because of it. Ms. Janson says it's so we can witness history. All I know is that me, June and Macie are going to the park with June's parents to watch the deployment. They say there might be a big explosion. I can't wait. Mom was going to meet us there, but she has to work. I hope Mom gets to go outside to see it, at least for a little while. Since Dad has been working on the deployment engine, he has to make sure everything is working good, so he is going to get a really good view. I'm sure Emmett will be with his dumb friends at the park too. Oh, they're here. I'll tell you all about it tonight. Dear Diary, I'm back and all I can say is wow! That was the coolest thing ever! There were two shuttles flying over us really high up, almost out of the atmosphere. We couldn't see it but they announced it over the speakers when they released the PAX. We thought that nothing would happen. Then all of a sudden there was a bright flash and we could see a huge fireball expand through the sky. It was so high up it took several seconds for the sound to reach us. Then everyone started cheering. When the fireball died out everyone started leaving. June's mom told us to head to the transport so we could go get some lunch. On the way to the transport we saw several people holding signs saying how bad the PAX was. They think it will damage the ecosystem and not have any effect on crime. I wanted to tell them that my dad would never work on something that would hurt anything, but Junes' mom made us walk faster past those people. We went to Chinny Chin's. I love their taco soup. After that me and Macie stayed at June's house for the rest of the day. We had so much fun. Macie said that Bobby likes me. I hope so because I like him too. Mom came and got me after she got off work. I don't think she needs to take me everywhere. She lets Emmett go wherever he wants. She says it's because he is older and that one day I can go where I want too. I can't wait to be older. Dad was really happy tonight. He said they will start to look at \"the numbers\" tomorrow to see if the PAX is working, but it will probably take a couple of days. He said since he worked on the deployment part he just has to review the engine's performance. I think that means he will not be doing much tomorrow. Today was so much fun I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I wish every day was just as good as today. Goodnight, Emmeline Dear Diary, Today at school all everyone wanted to talk about was the deployment. Not everyone got to see it. Bobby said I was lucky. His parents wouldn't let him watch it. He is so cute. I can't believe he was talking to me! That was in second lecture. The rest of the day I kept trying to talk to him again but he was always with his friends. June says he is just a dumb boy and that I should like someone else. She likes Charlie. He is two years older than us and friends with Emmett and I think he looks like a gorilla. Bobby is so much better. At supper Dad said people at work were worried about the PAX. He said it isn't acting right. He said that he would probably be working a lot until they figured out what's going on. I'm not worried though. Dad said they did a good job making it. He has been working with those scientists most of my life so he knows what they have been doing. He was so happy yesterday. I'm sure everything is fine because every time Dad says something isn't acting right it turns out that he is wrong and the thing is working right. Emmett said that he wants to be a scientist and make stuff like the PAX when he grows up. Mom and Dad think that is a great idea. I think it sucks. There is no way he will be a good scientist. I think he should be a pilot. He is really good with that type of stuff. After supper Emmett was being nice so he played checkers with me. He beat me twice, but I like it when he is nice so I didn't complain. Well, I have to do my homework now. What I really want to do is call Macie and talk to her about Bobby, but she is grounded. She told me and June at lunch that she and her brother had a really bad argument last night after we left, and they were both grounded for a week. So I guess I will do my homework. Goodnight, Emmeline. P.S. I really hope I get to talk to Bobby tomorrow. Dear Diary, I can't wait for school. Bobby will be in second lecture so I'm going to try and sit by him. And I can talk to Macie at lunch. I always hate it when one of us is grounded. We are together so much it's weird when one of us is missing. I will be back this afternoon to tell you all about my day. Dear Diary, Oh my gosh! Today was so weird! Everyone was smiling. Even Macie was in a good mood. Normally she is sad and mopey the entire time she is grounded. Bobby held my hand too! He barely talks to me ever and today he said he wanted to hold my hand and he didn't care if we got in trouble. Ms. Janson looked right at us and just kept smiling. He held my hand all lecture. I am so glad Macie was right because I really like Bobby a lot. The second best part of the day was that we don't have any homework. It was just as weird at home. Emmett didn't argue with Mom about what was for supper. Dad was smiling again, so I guess the PAX is acting right after all. Mom made her famous tofu salad for supper. It was SO good! It's my favorite thing she makes. She said that is why she made it. She also made Dad the steamed vegetables that he likes and Emmett a chocolate cake. She said I could go to the playground with June if it was okay with her parents. Since Macie is grounded I couldn't ask her. Macie was at June's house when I got there. She said her mom said that she and her brother weren't grounded anymore. So we went to the playground and talked until it was dark. There were a lot of people out there. It's like everyone decided to have a big party and everyone was invited. I'm tired now. Goodnight, Emmeline[Chapter 2] Dear Diary, Today was so dumb. We didn't do anything at school. Everyone just sat around, even the teachers. We didn't even play during recess. No one even complained about it but me. They just shushed me! Bobby wasn't at school so I didn't even get to hold his hand. That would have made it a little better. Macie and June thought the day was great. I think they are crazy because it was the worst day ever. Mom, Dad and Emmett were the same way all afternoon. Mom didn't even cook supper. She just sat in her chair all evening. I had to eat leftover tofu salad, and it is not nearly as good the second day. Emmett didn't even complain that he was hungry. That would have made Mom think about supper. I was so hungry but no one cared. I didn't get lunch today either because the cafeteria ladies were just sitting around with the rest of the teachers. I was so mad that I took my salad to my room and didn't say anything to anyone. Emmeline Okay Diary, This is getting even more stupid. Mom didn't go to work today. She just sat in her chair. She didn't even say anything when I asked her what was for breakfast. She just smiled at me! I had to make it myself. Then I was the only one who showed up to school. Not even the teachers came. So I broke all the windows in the cafeteria. Then I went to Macie's house but no one opened the door, so I went to June's. They didn't answer either. They are terrible friends. They don't care if I have nobody to talk to. I saw people everywhere, but they were all just standing around. When I bumped into a man in my way he just fell down and stayed there. How dumb! The city is quiet and it is annoying. Every now and then I can hear someone yelling, but they are far away. I got hungry and there is food in the school, so I just went in through the broken windows. Mom was still sitting in the same spot when I came home tonight. She didn't even ask where I had been. I don't think she loves me anymore. My life sucks. At least I still have you. Emmeline I am so hungry! Mom is still sitting in her chair. I don't know where Dad is and Emmett is still in his room. Nothing new there. I'm going to see if I can find food. Ugh, There were some people in the school! They were eating my food. I was so mad that I hit one of the men. He pushed me down and I cut my hand on a piece of glass. He laughed at me. So I picked up the glass and cut my hand more while staring at him. He quit laughing and gave me my food. It didn't even hurt. They were jerks. I think Mom peed in her chair. She is so gross. She didn't even get up to change clothes. From the smell, I think Emmett did the same thing. How lazy do you have to be to do that? I'm going to bed. Emm I can hear yelling. I think it is coming from the school. Those jerks better not be eating my food. That is my food! Mom and Emmett are still in the same places so can just go. I am going to take a knife with me. That will show those thieves. Just because I'm not a grown up doesn't mean I can't fight. They called me a baby so I stabbed the man who laughed at me yesterday. I think he died. The others took all of his clothes but all I took was his ring. It is pretty and I wanted to wear it on my face. So I made an older girl use my knife to make a hole in my ear. The hole was big enough that the whole ring fit inside it. She used a needle and some thread to make sure it wouldn't fall out. My shirt is all bloody but my new ring is pretty. Mom didn't even notice. I think she is dead. I'm sleepy. I looked in Emmett's room. He is dead and I am hungry. My knife is still at the school. I accidentally left it in the guy that laughed at me. There are others in the kitchen, not as good, but one of those will do. Mom stinks. I'm going to leave, but I am going to take another knife and my diary. I like you. This knife isn't as good as my other one. I'm going to go get it, and food. I'm hungry. I can hear the others. I bet they are using my knife. That is my knife! They were using my knife to cut food. Since it is my knife I got a whole arm. We're leaving. I have never been on a space ship. We are hungry and there is no food here and everyone stinks. I have my favorite knife and the other one too so I can get food just like all the big people. I am so hungry. There is nothing to suggest Emmeline Crumb stayed on Miranda after this time. It is unclear whether the first victim of this group's cannibalism was \"the man who laughed\", another member of their party, or someone who was already deceased. Emmeline's father, Emil Crumb was identified at his office desk. Evelyn and Emmett Crumb were found in the Crumb home, their remains were untouched. There was no clear evidence as to the fates of the other children mentioned in Emmeline's diary. ","Summary":" A/N This is an updated version of the story I posted last year.

One Walking into Zoe's quarters without permission, Mal asked her, \"Just what is that?\" She didn't reply, just tried to hide the test, before realizing it was pointless and holding it out to the captain. He knew exactly what it was before he asked. It was the reason he came to see her. Pulling a face, he held up his hands and exclaimed, \"I ain't touching it.\" \"You're such a baby!\" Zoe exclaimed. The captain raised his eyebrows at her poor choice of words and waited for his first mate's real reaction to hit. \"Oh, god,\" she said, tossing the test into the corner and covering her face. After a few moments of silence, Mal asked her, \"Were you trying?\" She nodded. \"Did Wash know that?\" She glared. \"It's just,\" the captain continued, \"I seem to recall a month long argument all across my boat about how all our lives were too dangerous to involve children.\" \"He wanted them, if our lives had been different.\" \"And you wanted them either way.\" Zoe shook her head slightly and wiped her hand across her forehead. \"Why did I think this was a good idea?\" Mal shrugged and said simply, \"You were in love. Guess it's natural.\" Not letting him have the high ground a moment longer Zoe then turned the conversation around. \"Speaking of love…\" she began. The captain immediately began to back away. \"Good talkin' to you,\" he said, while stumbling at the base of the ladder. \"How are you and Inara getting along these days?\" Zoe continued to press. \"Between you two and Simon and Kaylee this place is almost romantic.\" \"Yeah, an' Jayne and his hand. Goodnight, Zoe!\" She smiled at her boss' getaway, then rubbed her still flat belly and said, \"You're gonna have quite the time growing up here.\"[Chapter 2] Author Note: this fic was supposed to be a one-shot, but then, of course, inspiration hit, and I found myself needing to add to it. This bit is set almost six years after the end of the movie. I don't intend to write any more chapters, but I'll guess we'll see what my muse has to say about that… Two Taking a deep breath, and tightly clutching her most prized possessions to her chest, Zoe turned around and strode confidently into her son's quarters. She smiled at the sight of him play fighter pilot on his console. Just like his father , she thought, wistfully. It was the biggest compliment she could ever bestow upon him. Another deep breath. \"Hoban?\" Not looking up, he answered, \"Yeah, Mom?\" She knelt down beside him. \"Hoban, can you turn that off, please?\" \"Aww, Mom, do I have to? I'm winning.\" Zoe didn't answer, knowing she didn't need to. After a few moments more of Hoban carrying on playing he gave up trying to ignore her and pressed the power button. He turned to face her. \"Is everything okay?\" \"Yes, sweetie. Now, I know your birthday is still a few months away, but-\" He cocked an eyebrow at her, giving her pause. \"What?\" \"Why is it I always get presents four months before my birthday?\" He noticed. Of course he did. Clever boy, just like… Zoe swallowed. It was time. \"You remember all those stories Uncle Mal used to tell you?\" \"About my dad? Sure. He seemed like a cool guy.\" Zoe smiled again, but it was bittersweet. It took a lot of effort for her mouth not to cave in on itself, and for her not to give way to tears. \"Your father was an amazing man,\" she forced herself to say. Hoban frowned. \"Mom, why do you never talk about him?\" Because it hurts. Because I miss him. Because if I think about him too much I won't be able to carry on. \"Because it hurts,\" she admitted. When Hoban's frown only deepened she reached out and ran a hand through his hair with a promise of, \"You'll understand one day.\" He nodded, then his eyes finally landed on the items she was holding. \"Are they for me?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" He hesitated slightly with the next question, but eventually let it loose. \"Were they his?\" Zoe could only nod that time. It took every bit of strength in her body to hold out her arms and hand her husband's beloved toy dinosaurs over to her boy. \"Take good care of them,\" she instructed. \"I will, Mom. These are awesome!\" he exclaimed in return, before getting up to go play with them elsewhere. The moment he was gone from the room Zoe felt herself begin to break down, but suddenly Hoban was back in the doorway, looking at her. She wiped at the tears in her eyes roughly. She'd vowed long ago never to cry in front of him. Never to let him know how having him in her life gave her meaning, but also the harshest sorrow. \"What is it, sweetie?\" she asked, when he was still stood there moments later, silently watching her. Hoban bravely walked back into the room, handed one of the dinosaurs back to his mom, and then threw his arms around her – still with a toy in each hand. \"I think dad still misses you too,\" he said into her hair. \"You can keep this one, to watch over you.\" Zoe couldn't respond any more. Nor could she hold back her tears. She just held her son tighter and thought to herself: My boy is so loving, and he looks out for me, even when I hide my feelings. He can see straight through me, just like his father. The End Chapter End Notes If you're anything like me, you'll be a puddle of emotion right now. I'm only partly sorry. The timeline I'm going with it this: Zoe got pregnant one month before the movie is set, meaning she was one month gone (roughly) when Wash died. She found out two months after that (in chapter one), when she was therefore three months into the pregnancy. Hoban was born eight months after his dad's death, meaning he was four months old when the first anniversary rolled around, and the anniversary therefore falls four months before each of the boy's subsequent birthdays. P.S. Did you catch the significance of the boy's name? ","Summary":" Author Note: this is set about two months after the end of the movie.

Small, silvery tears streamed down her face, like raindrops on a window. Her auburn hair was messy, as if she actually cared to fix it. Nothing mattered anymore. Serenity's engine hums were low and somewhat sad, as if Serenity was asking what was wrong. Kaylee hugged her knees to her chest, withdrawing herself further from Serenity or anyone. She heard the mournful bustle of her crewmates as they tried to keep themselves occupied enough not to face the truth. Wash was gone. Kaylee couldn't handle herself. She felt like a five-year-old who was told that her gerbil died. But this was bigger than that. This was bigger than anything. Simon couldn't find Kaylee. He was pretty worried; Kaylee didn't handle death particularly well. And this wasn't one of River's infuriating games of hide and seek. Is she okay? His first bet was that she was out on Serenity, possibly washing all the blood and gore applied to Serenity's exterior to help them pass through Reaver space. He only found Inara repainting Serenity's symbol. After that it seemed obvious were Kaylee was. The engine room. Kaylee could look only at her hands. They were small, with many small scars from sharp objects in the engine, burns from whenever the engine caught on fire and so on. She could name all of the places they had been when she got those scars. She acquired most of them when they were out in the black, but there were various ones from when they were in the world. There was Whitefall, Triumph, Higgins' Moon, St. Albans, and Miranda. Simon started towards the engine room. He grew concerned about how Kaylee was feeling; he was a doctor after all. At Mr. Universe's home, Kaylee was shot by poison darts during the Reaver attack. Simon was wondering if either the medication or the poison could be altering her mood. Walking with a limp, he got to the engine room door. Kaylee could hear his walking about. After all, who had a limp besides Mal or Simon? Mal had the rest of the crew to distract, so she was sure it was Simon. She sat up a little bit. Simon knocked gently on the door before coming in. Kaylee wiped her face with the sleeve of her coveralls. Simon looked at her. His gaze was full of empathy. All of that madness was hard on all of them. He slowly and cautiously made his was over to Kaylee, gingerly kneeling down next to her. He caringly slipped his well-muscled arm around her. \"Kaylee…\" He began.\" I know all of this is hard on all of us, but sitting away from everyone and keeping to yourself like this isn't going to help anyone\". Kaylee looked up at him, tears continuously falling. He then slowly wiped away the tears on her wet cheek. Simon hated when she got sad like this. \"No, it's all my fault.\" Kaylee said, her voice shaking. She buried her face into her arms and started to cry more. \"Kaylee, what are you talking about?\" \"It's my fault Serenity spun out of control. I wasn't in the engine room. It's my fault that we didn't land smoothly.\" She began to sob. \" It's my fault Wash died!\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Kaylee shook with sobs as Simon hugged her. She thinks all of this was her fault. Her eyes were clouded with tears as she grasped Simon's shirt, bringing her closer to him. Simon immediately wanted to deny her thoughts on what happened. \"Kaylee, that wasn't your fault…, none of this was your fault.\" Simon took her small hand in his as she began her counterargument. \"Wash needed me down there…to steady the ship. He was counting on me\" .Kaylee looked up into his ice- blue eyes. But there was nothing cold about them. She was so innocent…how could anything like this happen to her. \"Kaylee\" Simon began. \"If you stayed down there you would have gotten hurt. The engine was on fire. It would have burned you.\" \"It should've\" She said darkly. \" I'm the one who should have died. I should've stayed down there.\" Kaylee curled up again. \"I should be dead!\" She yelled. Simon couldn't believe what he was hearing. Kaylee, so bright, so happy… turned into someone completely different. He felt like he was losing her. The engine room grew so cold. Simon enfolded her in his warmth, and her tears fell on his shirt. He couldn't care less. At that moment, the only thing he cared about was her. He gently stroked her hair in an attempt to calm her down. \"Don't say that…,\" Simon said, \"Ever\". He looked into her eyes. His own eyes watered. Simon pulled Kaylee even closer to him. He pulled her into a hug. Her small body was so small and trifling as she pressed into Simon. He closed his eyes as a tear streamed down his cheek. \" Where's Wash?\" Kaylee asked, concern growing. \" He ain't coming.\" Zoe said flatly. Her eyes widened in shock and remorse. Kaylee was devastated. It was her fault. Her fault. She felt like she had been shot. She was sure it was nothing compared to what Zoe was feeling. Zoe might as well shoot her now. It was her fault. Zoe's words echoed in her head. \"He ain't coming.\" She knew this was the torment she deserved. The dinner table was utterly quiet. No Wash to tell jokes. Just the crew. None of them had anything to say. They sat in deafening silence. Simon looked over to Kaylee. She was looking down, not talking, not eating. Simon took her hand gently from under the table. She flinched as he rubbed her hand with his fingers. Her eyes lacked the usual shine. They were faded, grey, so alien to their original warm green. She knew she daren't say anything. If she said nothing perhaps they would forget she was there. After all, that's the way it should be. Kaylee lay in her bunk. She could hear Simon pacing upstairs. Metallic steps echoed around the room. Simon was disturbed. He couldn't eat or think…his mind just kept racing back to her. He had to fix this. He knew he had to make her see his view on things. He thought out what he would say, but it was easier thought out that actually done. Simon knocked before he warily made his way down her ladder. He, once again joined beside her. She didn't look at him, didn't even blink as he brushed the hair from her face. \"Kaylee…this isn't you fault. There are so many things I've done wrong in my lifetime. There are so many imperfections, anywhere a person looks. But when I look at you, there is one thing I see…\" Perfection.

It was perfect, and he would rather see it used as Book saw it than used as a graveyard. \"I've been looking for it. You couldn't help some paying travellers could you?\" \"As long as they're paying.\" \"Of course, when can I expect you.\" \"A few days from now, a week at most if something goes wrong.\" \"Have faith Captain.\" With that Urie was gone, and all that was left in the cockpit was a stinging sensation in Mal's chest. It hurt to hear Urie use Book's phrase, even though Urie meant no more by it than the habit he had of saying it. Serenity landed on the planet as planned. Not gracefully, but it made it to the ground. All of the crew filed out, Mal first, Zoe and Jayne second, Simon and Kaylee waiting for River who had landed the ship. She was enthusiastic about flying, and Mal tried to teach her what she didn't already know. Which, as a psychic, there wasn't a lot. Urie jogged to meet the crew and shake each of their hands. \"Come this way,\" he said to Mal once he was done and Mal, Zoe and Jayne followed. \"They have been traveling for a year, keeping away from the Alliance.\" Urie explained. \"A brother and sister but they won't give us their real names.\" \"You sure it'll be safe for us to take them?\" Mal asked, his tone thick with reservation. \"I wouldn't put you in danger captain.\" Urie assured him, too honest to be lying. As they approached the door of a hut, it flew open and a woman, average in height, her long hair in a high pony tail that revealed the sides of her head to be saved. She wore brown leather over soft cream fabric over tanned skin that made even Zoe pause to take her in for a minute. Her eyes were an intense brown, and her darker still eyebrows were knotted together in anger. She swore in Chinese at the door as she walked. \"Lan!\" Urie tried to interrupt her stride. She stopped, even faced him but failed to lose any of her rage. \"Yes Urie!\" \"This is Captain of the ship Serenity as I-\" Lan moved to Mal and company, \"Very nice to meet you,\" she barked, \"Thank you for your assistance. Please excuse me.\" Mal turned to Urie with an expression that read, 'The money better be worth this.' As Urie tried to explain, a young man came from the door to shout back at his sister in english. As he did so, the crew took note of his leith structure, the same darkness in his short hair as his sister's, and the contrast in how loose his grey clothes were. \"Don't mind her,\" he assured everybody else quietly, \"She's pissed I won't tell her where her neice and nephew are.\" Mal scoffed, \"Kid you're no father, you're still a boy.\" The kid shot him a stern look, \"Close; the name is Cai. Talk about my family in that way again it'll be your last; favour or none.\" Mal perked up and turned to his crew, \"I like him,\" and back to Cai, \"but Orchid and Colourful? Kinda sissy fake names.\" Cai's features relaxed and he smirked. \"I'll go and get my sister, sorry about this Urie.\" Urie turned back to Mal with an apologetic smile. First impressions counted. Mal put his hand on Urie's shoulder. The gunshots started.[Chapter 2] Guns out and running, everyone was looking for cover. It took most people a while to find their bearings but Urie and the crew were already firing back as a small team of the Alliance advanced. A few of Urie's men were firing too. Maybe two soldiers of the Alliance fell. Four of Urie's brave know-nothings went down faster. There was nothing to be done really except keep firing and don't let the Alliance get to the free people who sought refuge with Urie. It was all beginning to look hopeless. Mal found himself praying River would find it in herself to show him how she managed to defeat all the reavers. He didn't believe it but it sure would be nice to see. Especially right now. But he couldn't see River. Or Kaylee or Simon. All he could see was Urie, Jayne, Zoe and strangers. This did not sit well with him. Running footsteps came from behind him. He turned to shoot. He watched Zoe turn to shoot whoever was after him but Lan rolled past him and kept running. He and Zoe's eyes met and they knew where she was going. They turned back to the Soldiers and kept firing. Then Cai appeared, knives flashing in his hands. And something strange happened. Lan attacked him. Not right away, she disarmed some Alliance soldiers first and gave Mal and company a chance to advance a little further, take up better positions. She assisted her brother and then the pair of them started wrestling. Seriously. \"What in the gorram-\" Jayne started but Mal ignored him and tried to keep firing. He had to reload. He ducked, did so and rose back up to find the siblings firing at Alliance soldiers with their own guns. When they were dealt with, Lan chucked the gun and jumped on Cai's back. From the path Simon, Kaylee and River were running towards the shooting from, having taken their own weapons from their attackers after River disappeared and reappeared, Simon saw something all too familiar. \"Get down!\" He pushed his sister and his girlfriend down to the dirt as someone pushed a pulse into the ground. Zoe had noticed the pulse being raised and called out, \"Down!\" as Simon had. All within earshot didn't question her command and dropped to the floor. Of course, the siblings didn't. Cai threw Lan to the floor and the pulse dropped him like a fly. Lan leapt back into action above her brother as the Alliance swarmed him. One gun shot was heard. The Alliance walked away leaving one body behind. Helplessly, Lan screamed, \"Cai!\" as he brother was taken away. When everyone who had avoided the pulse used to knock out those it came into contact with, they noticed the Alliance leaving and none of them wanted to give them reason to turn back. Mal, Zoe, Jayne, Urie, Simon, Kaylee and River all walked out into the open to watch them go. Simon ran to bodies checking if they were dead or unconscious. Mal walked straight to the panting, silent Lan on the ground and knelt to talk to her. \"Why'd they take him away?\" he said shorty. She didn't answer. He realized her breathing was shallow called to Simon. Simon directed Kaylee and River to check those he had missed before jogging t Mal's side. By the time he got there, Mal had pulled away the leather waist-coat the girl had been wearing and was putting pressure on the hole in her lung. She groaned, already in shock. \"Is there an infirmary here?\" he asked Mal. \"Only on the ship.\" Mal replied soberly. Simon ripped at his shirt and knotted it tight around the girl's waist. He turned to Mal, \"Moving her isn't ideal but if I operate out here she'll die of infection. She needs to be on board Serenity.\" Mal hesitated before agreeing, getting a familiar feeling. Simon enlisted Jayne's and the help of a few locals to transport Lan, while Mal approached River. \"What do you know?\" he asked. \"She's not like me if that's what you mean.\" she replied, looking around, her face jerking as though she were hearing and seeing into a world Mal couldn't. \"And the brother?\" \"No. But his wife was. They think the children are valuable.\" \"Who?\" \"The Alliance.\" She said, her eyes on her feet. She didn't like to talk about them. She walked away from Mal, who turned to Zoe for council. \"This is all a little too familiar for me.\" she commented as he approached. \"Good, we agree. Should we take the girl on board?\" \"She'll want to go after the alliance.\" \"We can't leave her here. They might come back for her if they don't get what they want from him.\" \"Then take her on board, we'll dump her when we can.\" Zoe said coldly. Since the death of her husband, she had mourned in private. This was the first thing Mal had seen truly bother his first mate. It was a bad sign, but he didn't want to put Urie's flock in the same kind of trouble he had Book's. He walked to Urie. \"How are your injured?\" he asked, and Urie looked at him with anger and sadness that wasn't evident in his tone when he calmly replied, \"Manageable. Will you take her on board?\" \"We'll get her out of your hair. If the Alliance come back -\" \"We're going to move camp a little more Easternly. We'll make it look like we're headed for the skies. Don't worry about us.\" Mal clapped him on the shoulder and turned to look for his crew. He saw Jayne and announced, \"Lets get back to the ship before they come after us.\" \"Won't they have seen Serenity?\" Kaylee asked, worried they would track and destroy her home. \"I think they were a little preoccupied to notice,\" Mal replied, still walking towards his ship, \"We'll throw a few tricks at 'em none the less.\"[Chapter 3] River was plucked from sleep knowing Lan was bout to start groaning harshly in pain. When it began she was half way to the medical room. Lan was running a fever and River wasn't sure if she should go near her or not. \"Cai!\" She roared as River soaked a cloth in cold water and pressed it to Lan's forehead. As she did so, she shushed the girl, and began to sing a soft Chinese folk song she didn't know she ever knew. \"I'll take it from here, River.\" Simon said as he entered, rolling up his sleeves. Kaylee followed him and took River outside. \"But I can help,\" River insisted. \"I know River, but she's dangerous.\" \"She only tortured one of them. She killed the rest, she wont-\" \"Enough, River.\" Kaylee said, stopping to face her lover's sister. \"We can't know things like that; those are her secrets you're telling me. Now let your brother see her well, you hear?\" \"Right.\" River submitted, turning to leave. Kaylee was right, even if it felt unfair to be taken away. Simon injected more pain killers into the IV drip the girl was on and waited for the delirium to calm. She had a fever, and he'd given her all of the sedative he could be sure she could handle, and it didn't look good. Zoey appeared at the door. \"Came to see how she was doing.\" \"Not well, I'm afraid.\" \"Fever?\" Zoey asked, coming closer. Simon nodded, knowing Zoey had enough practical knowledge about battle wounds. He didn't need to explain anything to her. \"How long has it been since we got her on board?\" Simon asked. \"Sixteen hours. Have you slept?\" \"Not yet.\" \"You go. I'll get her changed out of those clothes and see if there's anything I can put together from her belongings.\" \"And her scars?\" Simon asked. He didn't like it but it needed done; the girl was a mystery and anything they could find out without stressing River's... talents, was important. But it meant violating the girl's privacy by stripping her naked. \"I'll be professional.\" Zoey assured him. \"I trust you will.\" He sighed, fighting a yawn. As the door closed Zoey began punching the code in to mirror the windows to the infirmary. She moved to the girl and checked first the wound the doctor had operated on. It was as clean as a gun shot could be, stitched into an uneven line. The bandage was saturated with disinfectant and blood. Zoey first replaced the bandage, and as she rolled her sleeves up for the rest of Lan's garments, Lan's eyes opened. She lifted her hand to shield her eyes from the harsh light. \"Relax Lan, you've been shot.\" \"Soo-chow.\" she grumbled before beginning to cough. \"How do you feel?\" \"Feverish.\" she replied, her eyes rolling and her jaw quivering as though she was cold. \"My brother.\" \"Taken.\" \"Seen-teeyow!\" she spat. \"Why would the Alliance... Lan? Lan! Simon!\" Lan began convulsing, and the fresh bandage quickly turned Red. Zoey tried to hold the girl's shoulders against the bed as the seizure continued. Simon leaped inside, pulling on a shirt and going straight to a drawer. He pulled out an injection and put it in the IV. \"What happened?\" he demanded. \"She woke up. Asked of her brother. Seized.\" Zoey reported. They waited for her body to become still. Simon looked to the new bandage. \"I have to re-\" \"I can do it.\" Zoey insisted. \"Sleep, Simon. I'll call if something like that happens again.\" As Simon disappeared, Zoey started to unzip the marred leather waistcoat and cream cotton tank top underneath. She heard River's approach. \"You know you shouldn't sneak up on someone with a gun.\" Zoey cautioned as she gently peeled away the bloodied garments. \"You knew I was here.\" River said simply. Zoey smirked. \"I did. I also know you can't be pitching a fit in here if you see something with that third eye of yours you can't handle.\" \"What can she have done thats so bad?\" \"Do you know the things I've done.\" River stared at her. An understanding was made. \"Alright,\" Zoey decided, \"But if you get scared I want you to walk out and go to your room. Calm down on your own, you hear?\" River nodded and approached to help. Zoey sent River to fetch the Captain from the cockpit. \"Captain!\" she said urgently, \"You should see this.\" \"What is it?\" He asked, unstrapping his belt and leaving the pilot's chair. River took the seat without being asked as she replied, \"It's Lan. Zoey's with her now, waiting for you.\" No more needed said. Mal left to find out what was the matter. Jayne and Zoey stood with their arms folded, facing the bed Lan lay on, her body covered only by a white sheet, tilted on her side, her back and one leg only exposed to them. Mal slowed as he saw what they were staring at; a scar running in a straight line from her shoulder to her heel in a perfect vertical line. \"That ain't good.\" he sighed. \"No it ain't.\" Jayne agreed. \"What do we do with her?\" Zoey asked. \"Strap her to that bed, everyone in the cafeteria, now.\" Jayne and Zoey flanked Mal at the head of the table as Inara, River, Simon and Kaylee all sat around the table. \"If what happened in Urie's camp didn't,\" Mal began, \"We would have transported two very dangerous people.\" \"Who are they?\" Kaylee asked, looking nervously at her shipmates. \"We cant say for certain about her brother but Lan is or was a member of The Gesval.\" \"What's the gesval?\" Simon asked, taken aback from the reaction Kaylee and Inara gave. Fear was clear. \"A nasty bunch of thieves that took the term Pirate to a new level.\" Mal explained. \"And she's one of them.\" \"Maybe she got out.\" Kaylee ventured. \"Made a new life for herself.\" \"Maybe, but it ain't likely.\" \"Is she still -\" Simon began, \"Heavily sedated. When she's healthy we'll put her in a cell until we can be sure we're safe. That's it.\" With that Mal, Zoey and Jayne left.

He took the envelope being waved in frontnof his face from Kip's hand. \"How…did you stealnthese?\" He asked quickly. Kip looked hurtnthrowing his arms to his side like he was shocked, confused and readynto hit someone all at the same time. \"I know a guy,\"nTumbler said standing behind Kip. Ending the electricity between thenbrothers. \"They've been soldnout for three months, who do you know, the Governor?\" Randal askednsarcastically. Tossing the envelope back into his brother'snoutstretched hand. Kip's smile returned,n\"Hey don't worry,\" he teased, \"We got you and Otto ones too.\" Kip reached into hisnback pocket and pulled out a second off white envelope. The front wasnmarked with messy permanent marker, saying simply, for Randal. Randal smiled, noticingnthe writing. \"It's a nice gift, thank you.\" \"You better count menout.\" Otto said, emerging from the back paint shop. \"You mean to tell menwe finally get tickets to the greatest monster truck show on earth,nthat same show we've been trying to get ticket's for, for weeks,nand you can't go?\" Randal asked incredulously. \"Otto you seriousnman?\" Kip added. \"Hey,\" He said,nhitting Tumbler upside the head, \"Stay outta there.\" Tumbler shut thendrawer, to the desk he had been exploring, quickly. He turned to facenthe group, placing his arms across his chest like he'd beennstanding that way since he'd walked in. \"Kid, look around,\"nOtto waved his arms in the air to emphasize his point, \"I've gotntoo many cars and not enough time. Ever since Toby got hold of thenbooks he's had this place working full steam.\" \"And you're gettingnway more cash flow, right?\" Kip said, slightly protective of one ofnhis old crewmembers, and still friend. Otto sighed, turning tonRandal he said, \"You better check if Sway is free.\" \"I don't know,\"nRandal said smiling, \"She might not be the type of girl who likesnmonster truck shows, she wears lip stick now.\" Otto laughed. The air was hot andnsticky as Avery felt a hand on the small of her back. She blushed,nslightly uncomfortable with the lack space between her and a guy shenbarely knew. She was usually like that, uncomfortable with newnpeople. \"Now you kids havenfun, we'll be away for two weeks, Preston's cell will be off mostnof the time, but mine will be on for emergencies.\" Avery nodded in anpracticed manner at her mother's directions. \"Don't worrynChannel, you and my father should just focus on having a relaxingnvacation.\" The hand left her back and moved towards her mother'snsuitcase. \"Let me help you with this.\" \"Oh you're such andoll Tommy, Avery's lucky to have you as a host these two weeks.\" The guy smiled andnwalked out to the car, tossing the suitcase uncaringly into the trunknof the white Cadillac. Avery snorted, \"Hey…\" \"Is for horses, notnyour vocabulary. You know better than that.\" Her mother cut hernoff. Avery sighed, tryingnagain, \"You know we came to L.A. for a vacation, not so you couldngo off on a vacation somewhere else.\" \"Avery,\" Channelnsaid sharply, \"My vacation is where ever Preston is.\" Avery flattened hernmouth into as straight a line as she could manage. \"You should justnenjoy your time with Tommy, he seems like a great guy.\" Channelnsaid, placing her tiny black sunglasses onto her tanned face. \"I would have hadnmore fun at home.\" Avery said twisting the silver ring on her rightnhand thumb. \"Well you could usenthe sun.\" Her mother said curtly, turning, smiling and walking tonthe car. Tommy re-joined Averynon the side steps of his house. Well, his father's house, which wasnreally large and painted an off white with salmon colored trim. Averyncrinkled her nose in disgust as Channel waved from the open window;nthe car sped off down the street. \"I always had a thingnfor Ivory,\" Tommy said, rubbing her back comfortingly. She smiled. \"Go pack your bags,\"nHe said less sweetly, more business like. \"I never unpacked.\"nAvery said. Tommy looked surprised,nbut then shrugged, \"Alright bring 'em out to the car then.\" \"Where are we going?\"nAvery asked, trying to keep the sweetness in her voice, the lastnthing she needed was to get on bad terms with the only person shenknew on the entire coast. \"Long Beach.\" Hensaid blandly, picking up his cell phone to dial. He noticed her face andnshut the phone. \"It's not a bigndeal, I have friends out there I have to go see, plus wouldn't younrather be at the beach, it is summer.\" It was his sales pitch, eachnpoint jumbled together with a smile on top. \"Alright.\" She saidnflatly, walking to the room Preston's maid had assigned her. Twenty minutes laternthey were cruising down the highway in Preston's 1957 T-Birdnconvertible. White paint with red leather interior; Avery had tonadmit to herself she was pretty comfortable, whether Preston knew hisnson had taken his car or not. \"Long beach, huh?\"nAvery asked with slight curiosity. \"Don't worry,\"nTommy said, sliding his black sunglasses over his eyes to block thensunset's blinding light, \"You'll like it.\"[Chapter 2] The Convergence \"Kip it's a goodnoffer, I think we should take it.\" Tumbler stated, taking a swig ofnbeer. Kip didn't answer. Henstared blankly at his own bottle, half empty. \"It's after ninenman, where's Sway?\" Freb asked, sitting down on the stool next tonKip. \"It's not like hernto be late.\" Toby added, sitting next to Tumbler. \"Typical woman man,\"nMirror Man said, leaning against the bar in the middle of his fournfriends, \"keeping you waiting.\" Tumbler smirked, \"Yeanlet her hear you say that.\" Kip smiled, taking answig of beer. \"Nice,\" Frebnshouted, \"pool table opening.\" Toby got up silently,nfollowing his friend who handed him a pool stick. A song from the '90'snstarted to play. It was a melody vaguely familiar yet one thatncouldn't be named. \"Oh now I know theynain't gonna start playing that shit.\" Mirror Man said loudly,n\"I've got tah fix this.\" He chugged the remainder of his beernand walked directly to the jukebox, digging through his over sizednpockets for quarters. \"It's gonna be anlong night.\" Tumbler said, taking another swig of beer. Kip nodded, \"Mannwhere is she?\" \"Where are wenexactly?\" Avery asked, eyeing the large cargo ships suspiciously.nIt looked like a scene straight out of \"On the Waterfront\" exceptnmore modern and less welcoming, which she hadn't thought possible. \"We're meeting mynfriend at a bar.\" Tommy said, less friendly than Avery liked. \"No hotel?\" Averynasked, trying her best at weak-but-gets-everything-she-wants femalenvoice. Tommy smirked, \"After,nI just have to stop in and give him something, it's reallynimportant. Than we'll go to our room.\" Avery didn't flinchnon the outside, her face stayed cool as a cucumber, but her stomachnwas doing flip-flops. Sharing a room, possibly a bed, with a guynshe'd just met yesterday wasn't exactly her style. \"Here.\" Tommy said,nparking the car and getting out. Avery looked aroundnremoving herself slowly from the safety of her seat. The bar theynwere walking into was the classic fisherman's place, a plank fornstairs and ropes for handles. The door swung both ways and it had anclassic circular window hole, like the Titanic Avery thought. Thendoor was painted blue like the rest of the building and rust formednon every crevice. Tommy, the constantngentleman, held the door open for her. \"Thanks,\" Averynsaid sarcastically. \"My friend's rightnover there.\" Tommy said, brushing past her quickly. He reached outnhis hand to a guy sitting quietly in a booth. The unknown friendnstood shook hands and proceeded to engage Tommy in what looked likenthe world's most intense business conversation. Avery sighed. Shenrealized they stuck out like green grass in the middle of a droughtnand couldn't understand how Tommy didn't see this. \"This is going to bensome week.\" Avery said under her breath. Her frown deepened as shenrealized it was actually two weeks. \"Hey check this out.\"nKip said, pointing to Avery and Tommy. \"They're a littlenfar from Orange County.\" Tumbler remarked, ordering another beer. Kip's eyes followednAvery from the door. Her blue sundress was earning her plenty ofnstares. The guy she had come in with motioned for her to sit down.nThe booth was also occupied by a guy Kip knew more by reputation thannactual contact, but that was mainly due to Kip never really gettingninto the drug scene. \"This isn't good.\"nKip said quietly. \"Nope.\" Tumblernagreed, handing him a beer. \"Hey quit pounding onnthe machine!\" The bar tender yelled. \"It took my quartersnman!\" Mirror Man shouted back. \"Excuse me,\" Kipnsaid distractedly to the bar tender, \"When's Sway getting here?\" The gruff man lookedndown sourly, \"She ain't coming in tonight.\" Kip sighed. \"Perfect.\" Tumblernmumbled. Avery took a seatntentatively next to Tommy. He didn't bother introducing her, innfact his friend didn't pay much attention, just a simple nod andnthan back to business. They were talking jibberish to her, all aboutnamount and how the market was virtually untapped. For what she had nonidea. She was just hoping the other members of the bar would startntreating her like she didn't exist, all the attention was beginningnto make her blush, and more uncomfortable than she thought she couldnget. \"Hey man,\" MirrornMan said, re-joining Kip and Tumbler at the bar, \"check this out.\" He pointed towards thendoor where five very well built and visibly armed men had come in.nThe sixth was skinnier, but walked as if he owned the world. \"Shit.\" Kip cursed,nputting his beer onto the bar. Bravado oozed from hisnpresence as he strutted over to the booth. He stood uncomfortablynclose to Avery. She noticed Tommy's friend slightly tense. He hadntattoos up and down his well-built arms. His tattered black tee andndenims fit and helped him fit in. And his scuffed black army bootsnhad obviously seen a fight or two in their day. To Avery there shouldnbe no reason for this man to tense. But with the introduction of thisnskinny tan man and his oversized black and white, ex-military look anlike, body guards this tough friend of Tommy's certainly tensed. \"Phil,\" The skinnynman started, \"What's your friend doing in Long Beach?\" He turned his attentionnto Tommy, \"Here for the truck show pretty boy?\" \"No,\" Tommynanswered, annoyance laced in his voice. \"No,\" the skinnynman repeated, \"I didn't think so.\" He noticed Averynlooking at him; he smiled an oily smile car salesmen practice yearsnto achieve. Avery looked down at the table. \"What's the matternpretty boy,\" skinny man's attention went back to Tommy, \"thosenrich white folks loose interest in your expensive white fun?\" Avery's eyes widened,n\"Shit, drugs.\" She thought. \"More like, I'mnlooking to expand my market base.\" Tommy replied, seeminglynunfazed. \"I came to Long Beachnwith a drug dealer, fucking figures, thanks Channel, thanks so much.\"nAvery thought as she began to twist the hem of her dress under thentable, \"How am I getting out of this.\" \"Yea?\" skinny mannsmirked, \"maybe we should talk.\" Tommy motioned for himnto sit down across from Avery. \"Outside.\" Skinnynman said, sharply turning and walking towards the door, he whisperednsomething to one of his guards who smirked. \"Well,\" Tommy saidnmotioning to his friend. \"Like we have anfucking choice.\" The friend said agitated. \"Move,\" Tommy said,nlightly touching Avery on the arm. She got up, the roomnwas starting to spin. \"Tommy….\" Shenstarted but he cut her off. \"I'll be rightnback.\" He pushed her aside and walked out the door with his friend,ntwo guards followed them out. One had walked out already with skinnynman, leaving two with Avery. \"You're an awfulnlong way from home sweet thing.\" One said, brushing his hand up andndown her arm. The other one laughed,nsitting down across from her, they were boxing her in. \"Perfect,\" shenmumbled. \"Your boyfriend bringnyou along to all his business deals?\" The one who had been brushingnher asked. \"He's not mynboyfriend,\" She answered quietly, eyes focused on the battered woodnof the booth's table. \"Kip what are youndoing man?\" Mirror Man asked as Kip stood up and started walkingntowards Avery. Toby and Freb hadnstopped playing pool; Tumbler held his beer silently watching thenevent unfold. They had all huddled up when the skinny man they knewnas Slice walked in with his entourage. Drug dealers are usually badnnews, but drug dealers who have a criminal record longer than Santa'snlist and are smart enough with the law to stay on the streets, thosenare the guys you need to be prepared for. Bad things follow wherevernthey go and if you've been in Long Beach long enough you know Slicenis a name you want to avoid. \"Man this is notngood.\" Mirror Man said, shaking his head. Guard number one hadnmoved his hand to her back. Guard number two was laughing. \"Knock it off.\"nAvery said frustrated. He didn't stop. \"Please,\" shenbegged. Pleading just madenguard number two laugh harder and Guard number one bolder. He movednhis other hand towards her chest when something caught it. \"I think you'rendone man.\" Kip said sternly. Guard number two stoodnup. \"Here we go.\"nTumbler mumbled. Taking a final swig, emptying his beer. The guard starednincredulously at Kip. \"Who are you?\" \"Doesn't matter,nI'm a concerned citizen of this bar and I'm asking you kindly tonfuck off.\" Kip said, dropping the guard's hand. \"Better watch yournfucking mouth.\" Guard number two through his pointed fingernmenacingly in Kip's face. Avery heard a bottlenbreak and watched as shards of glass scattered onto the table. Guardnnumber two feel back into the booth, grasping his head and trying tonstop the bleeding. Kip ducked the firstnpunch as Freb's jaw connected with the second. Mirror Man pushednguard number one to the ground, screaming the whole way. Tumbler'snfist connected repeatedly with guard number two's jaw as Tobyndelivered a few swift kicks to guard number one before having hisnknees kicked out from underneath him. Avery felt arms grabnher, looking down she noticed marking around his wrist. She couldnonly see one, and it was for only a split second before she foundnherself running towards the door. Kip pulled the out ofnplace girl quickly towards the door. Freb and Toby were pre-occupiednby a few guys from the bar who felt joining in on the fight would benfun and Mirror Man was holding down guard number one shouting loudly.nWith guard number two sufficiently incapacitated Tumbler followed Kipnand Avery out the door. \"What…' Averynstarted, but was cut off, this time by Kip. \"Where are the keys?\"nHe shouted. \"Here,\" Tumblernsaid, tossing the clinking metal pieces into the awaiting hand. \"Getnoutta here, we'll manage.\" Kip nodded as Tumblernre-joined the fight inside. \"C'mon.\" Kip saidnto Avery wrapping his arm around her tightly. They walked quicklyndown the ramp. The violent scene fromninside was replaced by a war like scene outside, complete with car onnfire. She didn't see the red and white convertible anywhere ornTommy for that matter. She saw a couple of skinny man's guards innthe parking lot watching the car burn, their guns in hand. Skinny man was shoutingnat them, waving his hands frantically in the air. Avery was just aboutnready to collapse, and decided she probably would if her strangenknight not in shining armor's arm hadn't been around her. \"Get in,\" Kip said,ndepositing her next to a polished black car that looked like itnbelonged in a 1970's T.V. show. Her mouth openednslightly to protest, but then her brain engaged realizing the optionsnwere get into this stranger's car, the same stranger who saved hernor hang out in a parking lot in the middle of the night next to anseedy bar complete with brawl inside and cars on fire outside. She buckled her seatnbelt as they sped out of the parking lot, past a row of police carsnheading towards the battleground. \"I'm…Avery.\"nShe said unsure of herself. Kip looked at her a fewnseconds, than back to the road, \"I'm Kip.\" He said just asnawkwardly. He made a left at thenstop sign and a right at the next set of lights. Avery tried tonpretend like she knew where he was driving her, well aware she wasnfailing miserably at it. \"Your boyfriend's anreal people person.\" Kip scoffed, stopping at a red light. \"He's not mynboyfriend.\" Avery responded defensively. Kip opened his mouth tonsay something but decided against it. Avery looked over andnnoticed he was looking at her; she looked at her hands. \"Are you hungry?\"nKip asked awkwardly. \"Yea,\" Avery said,nsurprised at her self, \"I am actually.\" Kip nodded, \"Ok.\" He shifted into gear asnthe light turned green and took a left.[Chapter 3] Burgers \"Hiya Kip,\" greetedna smiling middle-aged waitress. \"Hey Nancy,\" Hennodded, taking a seat in a booth. Avery slid into thenseat across from him. The diner smelled like fries and milk shakes.nThe walls were plastered with '50's memorabilia, the boothsnlooked straight out of \"Grease\" and the room was completed bynstools lining a countertop, and a jukebox in the far corner. \"My ma works here.\"nHe said casually browsing a menu. She didn't scoff,nfrown, or laugh. Kip expected that amount of money to not look sonkindly upon the people with out it. No doubt the guy she came withnwouldn't be grabbing a burger at a dingy diner. She sure keptnstrange company. Avery noddednabsentmindedly and said, \"Cool. What do you recommend?\" Shenpicked up a menu. \"Other than dumpingnyour boyfriend?\" He said sarcastically, \"The burgers, they'rennot amazing, but they're pretty good.\" Avery nodded, \"Worksnfor me. I think I'm so starved I wouldn't notice if they werenpulled out of the trash!\" She frowned, \"And he's definitely notnmy boyfriend.\" Kip looked confused,n\"Where…when…uhm…\" he trailed off. Not sure of what henshould ask. \"Who, Why, and How?\"nShe finished for him; still smirking she put down the menu as thenwaitress came over. \"So what're yahnhaving hun?\" She asked cheerily, surprisingly cheerily for close ton1am. \"Two burgers, twoncokes. Thanks\" He smiled breifly, handing her the menus and shenleft. \"You know, you'renkind of sarcastic.\" He teased. \"Yea…sorry.\" Shenlooked at her ring. He studied her, stillnunsure about what to ask next. She was fiddling withnthe ring on her right thumb finger; staring at the table. Her wellnfit deep blue polo shirt and dark denim jeans, he expected werendesigner, definitely didn't put her living anywhere near here. Sonhe decided to start there. \"So,\" He startednslowly, still watching her, \"Where are you from?\" \"I,\" She hesitated;npulling her eyes from the table she looked at him. Somewhere in thenback of her mind she noted that she wasn't uncomfortable, shenwasn't blushing, and he was definitely a stranger. \"I'm originallynfrom Colorado,\" She let one shoulder up, and then pulled it down,nforming a shrug, \"But I got here by way of L.A. and a '66 fordnmustang.\" Kip smirked; there wasna definite possibility she knew a bit about cars. \"He's got a nicencar.\" Kip said, taking a swig of the coke the waitress had justnplaced, quickly, on their table. A group of bikers hadnjust filed into the diner, leaving the one waitress in the placenvery, very busy. \"Well,\" Averynswirled her drink, then decided to take a sip, \"I doubt henunderstands it's anything more than a convertible. And it's hisndad's anyways.\" A few minutes passed innsilence. \"So, how'd you getnto L.A.?\" He asked, suddenly smirking, \"aspiring actress?\" \"Ha!\" Averynlaughed, \"You wish! Nah I was there for vacation, with my mother.nShe decided to run off to Palm Springs with Tommy's dad; they'rendating; I don't think I mentioned that…but anyways, yea. Theynleft, and Tommy promised a beach and he was honestly my only friendnso I thought…hey why not?\" Kip stared at her anmoment, \"So Tommy was the guy at the bar?\" \"Yea,\" Averyngrimaced, \"Turns out we're not exactly friends.\" \"And your ma datesnthat guys father?\" Kip asked, taking a large bite out of hisnburger. Avery shrugged, takingna smaller bite, \"Well, my mom and I aren't exactly similar.\" Kip nodded. \"I'm Avery, by thenway.\" She stuck out her hand across the table. \"Oh,\" Kip reachednout, awkwardly shaking it, before letting it drop, \"I'm Kip.\" \"Thanks.\" Averynsaid, blushing slightly, staring at the table, \"For saving me, yahnknow? I can't figure out how I got my self here.\" \"No problem,\" Kipnsmirked, \"I think my boys were dying for a fight anyways. It was anslow night.\" He laughed. Avery smiled. \"So this guy, whondrives too nice a car for himself, tells you to pack your bags andndrags you to Long Beach for what he said was vacation and turns outnto be a drug deal, with one of the worst guys in Long Beach. And nownyou're stuck here how long?\" Kip asked, more comfortablynassessing the blue eyed, petite girl. She had a nice smile and reallynfull red lips, but he tried not to focus too much on details; she wasndistracting. \"Two weeks.\" Shensaid, pushing back her finished plate and taking a healthy swig fromnher drink. \"And where are younstaying?\" He asked. He noticed she'd finished most of her burgernand she'd touched her fries. A slow panic crept ontonher face. \"Oh gawd,\" she whispered, \"I have no idea!\" \"You don't knownwhere you're staying?\" Kip asked suspiciously. Maybe drugsnweren't too far off. \"No, he brought menright to the bar, he made all the arrangements, oh gawd, he even hasnmy bags!\" She was fully panicking now. Kip's mouth fell opennslightly. He grabbed it up quickly, Tommy needed his ass kicked, andnthen some. \"You can stay at mynplace for the night.\" He offered, \"And in the morning we can gonfind Tommy and get your stuff. It shouldn't be too hard, he sticksnout in a crowd.\" She looked at himnnervously. \"Yea, I think he does that on purpose…but why are younbeing so nice? You don't even know me? I could be like…an axenmurderer or something.\" Kip laughed, \"Inseriously doubt that, and I'm helping yah out because you look likena girl who's far away from home and's got no where else to go.\" \"I could go to anhotel?\" She said, but as more of a question. \"I've got my pursenstill.\" \"It's 2am.\" Kipnstated, smirking. Tonight's events definitely hadn't hit her yet. \"Oh.\" She lookednback at the table. A few silent secondsnpassed. Kip shifted in his seat, he wasn't sure how he was going tonexplain this to Memphis. \"Are you sure?\" \"It's really not anproblem.\" Kip assured her. She smiled, \"Oknthen.\" She tried to calm her nerves; it wasn't like she had anchoice. This seemed to be thenpattern ever since she got to Long Beach, her not having a choice andnfinding her self in odd and awkward situations…dangerous even.nThough she doubted the guy who saved her from dangerous was dangerousntoo. \"Alright,\" Kipnnodded, \"You ready to go?\" \"Yup.\" Avery tossednthe napkin from her lap onto the table. Kip smirked, \"Swaynwould love her manners,\" he thought sarcastically, \"Napkins innlaps not to mention the posture.\" He held the door open for her. \"Thanks, again,\"nshe smiled quietly. \"Sure,\" He lookednback into the thriving dinner, still stuffed with bikers, \"See yahnlater Nancy.\" From somewhere insidenthere came the muted response. \"I like your car.\"nAvery said, plopping in the front seat and buckling herself in. \"Yea?\" kip asked,nsticking the keys in the ignition. \"Thanks.\" \"Yea, I'd pick an'67 Chevie Impala over a Mustang any day.\" She slouched down innher seat, surprisingly tired. Kip smirked; shendefinitely knew a bit about cars.[Chapter 4] ~*~ Picturesnand Racecars \"Givenme a couple of minutes?\" Kip said, moving quickly from the livingnroom down the narrow hall. Thendisheveled house smelled like cars. Avery wasn't sure how that wasnpossible but the air was lightly tinted with a mixture of gasolinenand that sharp new car smell. Kip hadnswitched on a light when they'd come in, it hung limply from thenlow ceiling, illuminating a worn brown leather couch andnmiss-matching fabric armchairs. Their was a television that seemednbetter suited for the early '90s propped up on an old crate. Thenfloor between it all boasted car parts instead of a coffee table. Shenwatched as Kip moved from room to room, carrying what looked likensheets and pillows; but the light in the hall was dim enough shencould only guess. \"Younknow,\" She called, shrugging off her purse and tossing it lightlyninto one of the armchairs, \"I could just sleep on the couch.\" Her eyesnflashed back to the couch, but shrugged off her thoughts and didn'tnretract her offer. Kipnpaused in the hall, looking at her, \"Pretty thing like you? Nah.\" Averynturned her head towards the window so he wouldn't see her smile. Henstarted moving back and forth from the rooms again. \"Besides,\"nhe said, \"Tumbler and Memphis would be confused as hell tah see yahnthere.\" \"Tumblernand Memphis?\" Avery questioned, moving towards the shelves. \"Theynlive here too,\" Kip replied, \"Tumbler was in the bar earlier…hentossed the keys at me.\" \"Oh,\"nAvery said quietly. She twirled her hair nervously, though in truthnshe was starting to feel emotionally numb. It was like everythingnthat had happened in the past 14 hours was just a dream; she'd wakenup, in her bed, surrounded by her cloths, her things, her friends. Averynsighed, not mentioning people she actually knew or places shenrecognized, her clothes were still locked in Tommy's trunk.n\"Perfect,\" Avery mumbled to herself, \"best vacation ever.\" She letnher eyes run over the room some more, in desperate attempt tondistract her mind. Tommy was gone, her clothes were gone, and she wasnprobably a couple thousand miles from anywhere familiar. Thenshelves were littered with trophies, pictures and variousnmemorabilia. She smiled, picking a picture off the surprisinglynsturdy shelf. \"Isnthis you?\" Avery asked; she'd seen Kip re-enter the room from thencorner of her eye. He may have been her knight in shining armor, butnknights could turn out to be baddies too. \"Yea,\"nKip smiled, looking over Avery's shoulder. \"I was ten – maybeneleven?\" \"So younrace?\" She asked, looking up. He ran anhand through his slicked back hair. \"I used to…my family'snkinda into cars,\" He paused, sitting heavily and sinking into thencouch, \"I mostly just help in restoring 'em now.\" Averynnodded, searching for conversation. \"So, uhm…who are the othernpeople?\" Kipnpatted the cushion next to him on the couch; Avery sat, sinking backninto the cushions. He noticed for the first time she was wearingnperfume; it wasn't sweet, or strong, just a soft clean smell. \"That'snmy ma,\" Kip pointed, pulling his attention back to the picture,n\"And my older brother Memphis.\" \"Oh,nyour roommate?\" She began twirling her hair again. Forcing back thenthoughts of how she'd just totally agreed to a sleepover at anstranger's house; a stranger she'd met while he pulled her out ofna seedy, burning bar, complete with drug dealers and waterfrontnlocation. Hensmirked, \"The one and only.\" Shenhanded him the picture; he noticed her nails were short and paintednblack. \"That'snan interesting color.\" He commented; hoisting himself up andnplacing the picture caringly back on the shelf. Averynnodded, \"I like it.\" She replied simply. She'd almost gottennher thoughts quelled; but the constant butterflies in her stomachndidn't help any. Kipnstudied her a moment \"You know cars?\" He asked. Averynsnorted, then blushed lightly after registering that sound had comenfrom her. \"Way to be un-lady like,\" Avery thought, mentallynkicking her self. \"Barely,\"ncontinued, recovering her complexion, \"But I know which ones Inlike. I kinda have a checklist of the ones I want.\" It wasnKips turn to snort. He didn't blush, \"You have a car?\" he askednpointedly. \"How many cars do you have so far?\" Was what he hadnthought. Averynshook her head, \"Nope, I mean…I've got my license, I just don'tnown a car. I wish.\" \"Oh,\"nKip said, shrugging, \"Huh.\" Averyntwisted her hair, which fell just below her shoulders; straight and andusky blonde. A fewnseconds passed in semi-awkward silence. Avery cleared her throat.nShe'd thought about asking for a tour and nixed it. \"What would Indo if I found something disagreeable?\" she thought, \"It's notnlike I could go anywhere now.\" \"So…younwork in a garage?\" She asked. Trying to regain control of thenbutterflies that had stirred at the thought of how stuck she reallynwas. Hensmirked. \"Yup,\" he stretched, yawning, and glanced at the clock,n\"I'll probably be there by the time you wake up tomorrow.\" \"Oh\"nAvery mouthed silently, nodding slowly. Kip stucknout his hand; Avery accepted, and he rescued her from the bowls of,nprobably, the most comfortable couch she'd ever sat in. \"I'llnleave directions and a phone number.\" He said reassuringly. \"Ok,\"nAvery tugged her shirt back in place. \"I'm gonna try the hotelsntomorrow morning. So with any luck I'll have a room by the time Insee you.\" She smiled. Theynwalked down the cramped, dimly lit, hall. More family picturesndecorated the walls; unevenly. Kip swung open the first door on thenleft, \"Bathroom,\" he instructed and kept on walking. Swingingnopen the second door on the right revealed a freshly made bed, twonroughly folded towels, and a motorcycle. Or at least part of anmotorcycle, rested at the foot of the bed. A narrow desk, stool, andnshort chest of drawers were the only other occupants in the room. Itnwas on the small side; but felt homey. Averynsmiled wider, she couldn't stop herself, \"Planning on driving itn'round the house?\" She asked teasingly. \"I'mnbuilding it,\" Kip laughed, \"It's no where near done. I hadnanother one, but sold it a while back.\" \"Huh,\"nAvery replied, still smiling. She sat stiffly on the bed. \"Yea,nso…\" Kip started, digging through the chest, \"Those are freshntowels and sheets. You saw were the shower is…you kinda hafta waitna couple of minutes for the water to heat up.\" He saidnit rushed; Avery cocked her head slightly to the side. Since when wasna knight ever embarrassed? \"Nonproblem.\" Avery said, smoothing out invisible wrinkles in hernjeans. Kipntossed something from the drawers at her, \"Sorry,\" he saidnearnestly, \"It's the best I've got, it should be big enough ton… uh…work?\" Averynheld up a large Metallica t-shirt. \"Perfect,\" She smiled. Kipnnodded, heading out the door. He paused at the frame and turned tonface her. He opened his mouth to ask something, but decided againstnit. \"Uhm,\"nHe stated, \"The door locks, if you're…uncomfortable?\" Henshrugged unsurely and trudged lightly down the hall. Averyntilted her head again at the now vacant door. Shaking out hernponytail she stood up, shutting the door, changing, tossing thentowels and her clothes to the foot of the bed. She admired thensemi-built motorcycle a few moments before flicking off the lightsnand sinking into bed. She was awake just under a minute beforendrifting off to sleep. She leftnthe door open a crack, letting a sliver of soft yellow light in fromnthe hall.[Chapter 5] ~*~ Memphis Avery let out a groannas she rolled over in bed, glancing at the clock. It was 8am. It wasnsummer and she usually slept in until at least 11. She shook out thentwo braids she'd folded her hair into the night before and lookednaround the room. She smiled as she noticed a plain yellow post-itnstuck to the lampshade next to the bed. In even, though notnelegant, script it said, \"Gone to work. Kip.\" In smaller writingnan address, phone number, and directions followed. Avery smiled; henreally was a nice guy, needed to use less hair gel. Avery shook her head.nShe wouldn't know him long enough to have any sort of influencenover his hairstyle. She'd be moving into a hotel room tonight,nhiding out there until Channel comes home. Then she'd be on her waynhome. She'd probably never see him again after today. She frowned; pushingnthose thoughts to the back of her head she assessed the room somenmore. It was comfortable here, peaceful. Warm yellow sunshinenstreamed through the two bedroom windows, opposite the door and hall,nthough most definitely needed cleaning. She stepped out of thensurprisingly comfortable twin bed. Snatching up the towels and hernclothes she padded across the tan carpet. It was littered with oilnand grease stains, even in the hall. She shrugged. \"Itncould be worse,\" she mumbled to herself. Switching on the shower itnsputtered to life a few seconds later. She moved her hand backnand forth through the chilly water a few minutes before depositingnthe Metallica T and hopping in. Twenty-five minutesnlater she was out, dressed and her tresses were tightly wrapped innthe towel on top of her head. Avery folded Metallicanand made the bed. \"Strangest vacation ever.\" She muttered tonherself again. It was a habit. Moving to the kitchennshe flipped open the phonebook and started dialing every hotel thatnseemed half decent. Her cell was keeping pretty decent charge; she'dnturned it off last night after realizing she had no charger and itncould run out. She made a face at thenthought of being without her cell. \"Hello? Is this thenDay's Inn?\" Avery spoke into her phone hopefully, \"Ok perfect,nI was wondering if I could get a room for…\" \"All booked up.\"nThe voice said before abruptly clicking off. \"Right,\" Averynsighed, trying the next number. Fourteen hotels laternAvery was put on hold. It was her last shot before trying some of thenmore inventive lodging numbers in the area. She poured out a bowl ofncereal, after a very effective search mission for cereal and milk. These boys neededngroceries, bad. She hopped up on thencounter. Chewing patiently. \"Miss?\" The voicenon the other line sounded stressed. \"Yea?\" Averynswallowed quick and asked, \"So can I get a room?\" \"Well,\" The womannsounded almost apologetic…almost, \"We have one reservation thatnprobably isn't coming. We have to hold it as courtesy until 11am.nBut we can put your name down and then if they don't show up we'llngive the room to you.\" \"Okay,\" Averynagreed, it was her best shot, \"Thanks.\" They clicked off andnAvery took another bite of cereal. \"Who are you?\" Andeep male voice asked. Avery spun on hernheels, \"Oh.\" It took her a moment tonrecognize the face from the picture. He'd gotten older. \"You're Memphis!\"nShe exclaimed, sticking out her hand, \"I'm Avery.\" \"Hi,\" He answered anlittle apprehensively, \"I'm Randal.\" The girl lookednslightly puzzled, moving her dish to the sink and rinsing it, \"Kip'snolder brother right?\" A small smirk hinted atnthe corner of Randal's lips, \"Yea…you're Kip's friend?\" Avery shrugged. Movingnthrough the apartment and down the hall. \"Uh…where is he?\"nRandal asked, following after her. \"Oh, at work,\" Shenanswered; unfurling the towel she ran a hand through her damp hair.nIt was starting to curl. She hung the towel over the railing and,nsnatching up her purse from Kip's room, moved back to the mirror innthe bathroom to apply mascara and lip-gloss. Avery internallynsighed; she didn't have her makeup bag and this would have to do.nRandal was still watching her. A full smirk played across his lipsnnow. \"I'm headed therennow actually,\" she offered, grabbing the post it note from thenlampshade. \"I can drive you,\"nRandal said, more of an instruction then an offer. Avery just shrugged,nit'd be better then trying to figure out public transport, \"Okay….nthanks.\"[Chapter 6] Welcomento the Garage \"I like your car,\"nAvery offered. The entire ride so far had been in awkward silence. \"Thanks,\" Memphisnsaid, making a right, \"Kip bought it for me.\" Avery just nodded. Outnthe window Long Beach wasn't getting any prettier. And she startednto wonder if there even was a beach in Long Beach. And if there was,nit was probably covered in trash, in the regular and white variety. Avery smirked, and thennmentally kicked her self. Who was she? Channel? She didn't thinknlike that, usually. \"So,\" Averynstarted, trying to distract her mind, \"Why Memphis?\" \"Uh,\" Randalnshifted uncomfortably in his seat, \"Well…what has Kip told you?\" \"About you? Not much,njust that your family was into cars.\" Avery replied, staring outnthe windshield. They seemed to be approaching a large junkyard.nComplete with chain link and wood board fences. \"Well,\" Randalnlaughed to himself, \"Yea, that's about right. I drove a car fromnhere to Memphis once. When I was younger. And the name stuck.\" Avery nodded. The carnwas parked. For a junkyard therenwere an awful lot of antique cars scattered about. But the randomnpiles of tires made up for it. \"Twilight zone,\"nAvery mumbled. \"What?\" \"Oh, nothing,\"nAvery turned her head to hide the blush. She noticed a couple of guysnstanding on what looked like a makeshift deck. \"Listen, the doorsnthrough there,\" Randal pointed, \"Kip's probably in the back bynthe paint shop.\" \"Thanks,\" Averynsmiled, unbuckling. She noticed the figuresnwatching them, one gave a singular beckoning wave innMemphis…er…Randal's direction. Randal unbuckled andngot out, \"Listen I've gotta go take care of something or I'dnwalk you back myself.\" \"No worries, andnthanks,\" Avery smiled and climbed out of the car, \"It was nice tonmeet you.\" Randall turned back tonface her, a now familiar smirk plastered across his face, \"Nice tonmeet you too.\" Avery walked towardsnthe unmarked entrance of the large, waterfront garage. Casually shenglanced back at the group of three standing on the makeshift porch. They seemed perfectlynat ease with the surroundings. Spare car parts and tires piled aboutnantique machines. It was right out of the twilight zone, Averynthought again. She pushed open the wooden door, it's rusted hingesnsqueaked, not that you could hear them over the din from inside thenlarge building. If the outside yard hadnbeen a mess, the inside was more like a small town in the after mathnof a hurricane. Avery held back a grimace. All around her menncovered in overalls and general baggy apparel, half soaked in oil andngrease worked on various aspects of a wide variety of cars. Bon Jovinblared over all the drills and bits. Avery sighed, which way was thenpaint shop? She never had been one for tech-ed in High School. A pit bull shaped manncompleter with jowls and graying around the temples approached her,neyes still shielded by goggles. \"Can I help yah sweetharht?\" Perfect, Avery thought,n\"Yea, I'm lookin' for Kip?\" She tried her best to keep anneven voice, like it was typical for her to be hanging out surroundednby half working cars and a garage full of rough-around the edgesnmiddle aged men. Out of the corner ofnher eye she saw an overall clad body turn. He'd been bent over annearby car's hood, she guessed working diligently at something innthe engine. \"Hey Jimmy,\" thenbody sauntered over, with a natural swagger built into his walk. \"Did ever body looknlike a boxer around here, or was it just her imagination?\" shenthought to herself, a waning smile still on her lips. She was goingnfor friendly and worthy of directions to Kip. \"I got this, whyndon't you go back tah shinin' that Buick of yours.\" The guynsaid with a smirk. He was probably around Kip's age, Averynreasoned, so much for thinking the place was filled with the middlenaged. He was dressed in baggyndenim overalls, only one strap clipped, with a plain maroon t-shirtnunderneath that looked one, maybe two sizes too small. His sandynblonde hair was done up in spikes, most likely helped out a bit bynsome gel. Avery smirked tonherself. Some things were just universal. \"Aw forget you kid,\"nThe guy spat in response, \"You know damn well I'm workin' onnthat '35 Ford, and what'd yah got? A Pinto.\" The newest stranger,nthe young one, faltered, the smile falling back a bit, \"It's fornsentimental value or somthin' it's not my fault Otto takesnwhatever he gets for work.\" He waved a hand around emphasizing hisnpoint. Avery glanced, she wasnno expert in shop sure, but she knew a good car when she saw one. Most of the cars, fromnwhat she could tell of them, seemed to be the valuable kind ofnantique. The Pinto definitely stuck out. Though there might have beenna '96 minivan in the far corner, but she couldn't really tell,nthere were too many things blocking her line of sight to get a goodnview. \"Oh so you're goin'nafter Otto now?\" The pit bull man didn't seem to be in a good, ornhelpful mood. Avery frowned, the kidncould definitely take the middle-aged guy, and his arms were innshape, she was sure the cut off sleeves meant to show off thenmuscles, like the tightness of it. And he didn't have the beer gutnof his opponent but she really wasn't in the mood for a fight tonbreak out. She just wanted to find Kip, which was kind of strangenconsidering she didn't really know him that much better. \"I'm not goin'nafter anyone old man,\" the kid waved off the offer and turned hisnattention to Avery. Ending the confrontation before it reallynstarted. \"Hi,\" he smiledncrooked and Avery's stomach did a flip. He stuck out a handncasually, \"I'm Tumbler.\" Avery couldn'tnentirely hide the smile, everyone had really strange names aroundnhere, \"Avery,\" she offered, \"I'm looking for Kip?\" \"Ah,\" Tumbler said,na certain realization seeping into the swagger, \"Yea he's out bynthe paint shop.\" He paused, lookingnAvery over a minute longer then necessary, and sure enough a faintnpink crept into her cheeks. That seemingly decided whatever it wasnthat needed deciding in Tumbler's head, \"I'll show yah.\" \"Thanks.\" SuddenlynAvery found herself wishing she'd had her makeup bag this morning. \"Welcome to Otto's.\"nHe said, smiling infectiously. She couldn't stop the large smilenthat spread across her face in response.

Then the lady spoke. Dana's hand lowered and Marty shuddered beside her. \"Dana. Marty. You wouldn't want to press that button, believe me\" \"Believe her? Believe HER?\" – Marty exclaimed in increasing panic – \"Dana, don't listen to her and just–\" – he tried to reach the button but Dana pushed him away from it, the adrenaline wearing her down and making her think clearer. \"If you two will just come out, I promise, no one will shoot at you, no one will try to kill you\" \"What, no more zombies coming at us?\" – Marty said caustically – \"Dana, let's make them choke on it, c'mon!\" \"We should go out there\" – she said, very calmly. \"WHAT! Dana, what the fuck!\" – but she was already getting up and heading to the door – \"Dana, no, what're you doing! They're gonna fucking shoot us! The fuck, man!\" \"I don't think they will\" – she whispered, staring at the door, and then back at him – \"You can press it now, if you want, but I'm going out there\" \"No, Dana, c'mon, don't do it, I can't do it alone, c'mon, c'mon\" \"Come with me, Marty. It'll be okay\" \"You're gonna believe some nut job we can't even fucking see?!\" \"I don't believe in her\" \"But you're going out there!\" \"I believe that there's more at play here than just– Just us being chased by monsters through the night and even more monsters in glass cages\" \"Yeah, it's about them putting fucking bullets in our skulls, Dana! Wake up already!\" \"Marty. I'm going out. You can either come with or not, but I've made my decision\" \"Dana, why?\" \"If I'm going to die, it's not going to be in a dingy little control room\" \"You'd rather get eaten by some giant snake, or whatever the fuck else they got locked up out there?\" \"Yes\" – he groaned. \"You're insane\" \"I know\" \"We're gonna die out there\" \"Probably. But we've gotta die some time, might as well go all out, don't you think?\" \"That would be pressing the button and letting them deal with being chased around!\" \"Are you coming?\" – he looked at her hand for a moment and breathed in deeply. \"If we're gonna die, we better damn well die together, at the very least\" – she grinned as he got up and held her hand tightly. \"I hope we can\" \"That's not reassuring at all\" – he grumbled and held his breath as they walked out. The hallways were littered with men in all black holding massive weapons, looking at the bloody duo with suspicion and detachment. Marty held Dana's hand tight enough to break her bones, but she said nothing as they made their way to the elevators and a woman was waiting for them. Unlike the men, she was dressed impeccably in a skirt suit, hair all in place and she gave off an air of poise and power that Dana and Marty had never felt before. \"Well, well. You two have to be two of the most interesting people I have ever met, and that's saying something, considering how many people I've met over the years\" \"Does that mean you're an immortal or something?\" – Marty bravely, or dumbly, blurted out. Dana hid a smile as she caressed his trembling hand. The woman grinned blankly. \"I am not an immortal, I am simply much older than either of you, and I have been in this business for longer than either of you have been alive\" \"Killing innocent, unsuspecting college students, you mean? THAT business?\" – Marty spat at her, feeling the burn of the horrors he'd seen and endured in the last few hours. \"Saving the world, actually\" – the woman said impassively – \"It's the most noble of deeds\" \"No, it's fucked up\" \"To each their own\" \"What do you want from us?\" – Dana interrupted, wiping some of the tears and blood and grime off her face. \"I want you to understand\" \"Understand that we almost died tonight, and our friends suffered horrible deaths for nothing?\" \"Not nothing, no\" \"Then what?\" \"I told you, saving the world\" \"How do their deaths\" – Marty started – \"or our deaths, for that matter, equal saving the freaking world?!\" \"If you'll follow me, I can show you\" – the friends traded looks. \"Up to you\" – the young man said softly. He squeezed Dana's hand. \"Fine, we'll come with you\" – she said, looking the older woman in the eye. It was a long way down increasingly darker corridors, the steel walls turning into stone and dirt, and Marty and Dana continued holding hands, as if it were the only thing keeping them alive and well. How long that would last was a thought they tried their hardest to keep away from their scattered brains. The woman opened a heavy door and a few steps later stood in the middle of a platform. Dana and Marty carefully followed, and frowned at the huge stones surrounding them, each of the five pieces with carvings, and four of them bloodied. The only one which remained untouched was of a woman with a long piece of cloth over her head and body. \"From ancient times\" – the older woman began in a steady tone – \"there have been beings that demand blood. I have made my living continuing the work of countless others before me, and I am sure the moment I perish, others will easily pick up the mantle, because this is, by far, the most important job in the world\" \"The hell is this place?\" – Marty questioned, glancing at the edges. Like Dana, he tried to push down the unease at the grumblings they could hear from under their feet. \"This is the center of Their power, or the center from which They can rise\" \"Who's... 'They'?\" – Dana asked quietly. \"They are all powerful agents of destruction, and it is some part of humanity's work to make sure they are properly... Entertained\" \"Enter– Is that what this whole thing was about?! Entertaining some bloodthirsty ancient as fuck monsters?\" – Marty screamed and shut up with a click when the grumbling turned into not quite muted snarls. \"You would do well not to anger them\" – the older woman said calmly – \"They can be quite unforgiving\" \"Why did you bring us here?\" – Dana asked, looking at the only untouched slab of stone – \"What are these– Carvings?\" \"They are the necessary elements in the maintenance of the world as it is\" \"Holy shit\" – Marty whispered, looking from one stone to the next with wide eyes – \"It's us\" \"Curt, Holden, Jules\" – Dana pointed at each stone and paused – \"It's you\" – she pointed at the figure seemingly dancing with a cup in its hand. \"Great, I'm the drunk\" \"The Fool, actually\" – the older woman interjected. \"Not much better\" \"And I'm–?\" – Dana asked, motioning to the unblemished stone. \"The Virgin\" – Marty snorted – \"We work with what we got\" \"This is messed up, man\" – Marty remarked – \"So, what, you gotta grab one of each and kill 'em off? The more nightmarish the better?\" \"Something like that. This year is clearly a little different, however\" \"Because we figured it out\" – Dana mumbled, looking at the carvings. \"Yes. It's never happened before\" \"Well, we're not totally dumb. Rising the dead notwithstanding\" \"What happens now?\" – Dana asked, turning back to the woman – \"We're alive, we're here, are They happy about this? Was this entertaining enough for Them?\" \"Almost. You see, Dana, there is an order to the sacrifices–\" \"And now we're sacrifices, awesome\" \"First the Whore–\" \"Dude! Jules was awesome, she was dating Curt since the start of college!\" \"–then the order is not entirely important, as long as the last one standing, or to die, is the Virgin\" \"And we still got two sacrifices walking around\" – Marty concluded. \"Correct. Now it's up to you what happens\" \"What happens?\" – the woman smiled serenely. \"You may choose to continue the ritual and save the world, or not, and then the world will end, but you don't want that, do you? Marty, Dana?\" \"If this is what some people are spending all their time doing, creating fucking nightmare creatures and plotting the demise of a handful of innocents, then maybe we shouldn't– Dana?\" – she was staring at the edges of the platform – \"Dana?\" \"It's not everyone\" \"What?\" \"Not everyone wants to kill innocent people in order to satisfy the desires of– Them\" \"No, but–\" – the girl looked back at him and frowned. \"I don't want to start the end of the world, Marty\" \"Hey, neither do I, but–\" – the red head shook her head and looked at the woman. \"Will you take care of our families? Jules was going to become a doctor to help her brother... And Holden's family–\" – she swallowed and Marty widened his eyes – \"Make sure they're taken cared of\" \"Dana–\" \"We will\" – the woman promised solemnly – \"We thank you for your sacrifice, I hope you know that\" \"Yes\" – Dana looked at Marty and let go of his hand – \"And you're welcome\" – she smiled and made to jump off the platform, but at the last moment, she turned and tackled the shocked older woman – \"Thank you for your sacrifice\" – she snarled, and started to push her off the edge. Marty scrambled but ran to help her, and together, the friends pushed the screaming woman off the platform. They laid down, crying, laughing and barely managing to catch their breath. \"This may have been the dumbest or smartest thing we've ever done\" – Marty commented. \"I guess we'll find out\" – Dana replied – \"You got any joints left?\" – he snorted and pulled a slightly worse for wear pot cigarette from his pocket and gave it to her as he tried to find his lighter in his other pocket. \"I'm with you 'til the end of the world\" – he said, turning to light the joint for her. \"If we survive, this'll be the most epic weekend getaway story ever\" \"I don't know, Mal always has the weirdest stories to tell\" – they laughed as the joint was shared every few moments. They remained lying there, awaiting the end of the world, or the simply continuation of their lives. Come what may. After the night they'd had, they sincerely had no fucks to give either way. And then, either the HAND came crashing down on them all, or THEY liked the show enough to overlook the fact they traded one fool for another.

I'm working on your face right now and it'd be the worst time to screw it up.\" \"Haven't you been on my face for awhile now?\" he wiggled his eyebrows and she scrunched her nose at him, ignoring the flush that was building at the base of her neck. He laughed at her reaction before adding, \"I bet you're just taking your sweet time so you can continue to stare at this beautiful mug that God bestowed upon me.\" He gestured towards his face before the threat of her glare forced him back into his previous position. \"Sure it is, Marty.\" She made a few swipes with her pencil, darkening the lines of his mouth. She heard him chuckle but didn't glance up just yet. She made a few more last minute touch-ups before surfacing. \"Aaaaannnnd…done!\" She grinned over at him before bouncing on the bed over to his side. He accommodated her, wrapping one arm around her and the other reaching for her sketchbook. She mischievously held it just out of reach and he let out a playful groan as he made another attempt for it. She only let go of it when he used his trump card and went for that ticklish spot on her waist. He used her distraction to his advantage and was quick to grab the picture to finally get a good look. Trying to catch her breath, she shook her head in amusement and rested her head back on his shoulder as she waited for his reaction. Despite herself, she felt her nerves coiling in her stomach at what he might think of it, though she knew her own skill. She just hoped he liked it. \"Wow,\" he breathed, giving her an answer. He handled her sketchbook with care, placing it on his bent knees as he stared down at the drawing in awe. \"I knew you were amazing but this is…wow, Dana.\" She giggled again, snuggling closer, \"So, what, do you like it?\" He kissed the side of her head in response. She beamed up at his profile and asked, \"Is that a yes?\" His fingers ghosted over the image of himself, too lightly to smudge, and he turned to look her in the eye. \"I love it,\" he said seriously. Her smile was soft and radiant as he leaned down to kiss her gently. She kissed him once more on the cheek before laying her head back into the crook of his neck as they gazed down at the drawing. A comfortable silence drifted over them, but it was peaceful and neither minded. Marty broke it after a couple of minutes, \"So when do we get to do the nudes?\" He laughed as she thumped him on the arm. He didn't even stop when she pushed him off the bed- he merely pulled her down after him. -x- A/N: So I really wanted something where Dana drew Marty (because lets face it Fran Kranz is like an artist's dream ok have you seen his hands?) because she's obviously an artist and I just thought it'd be cute and they'd be all adorable and cuddly and whatnot.

Marty lights a joint and passes it to Dana, letting her have the first puff. She sucks on it for longer than needed, vaguely remembering that this is the first time she's ever smoked weed, and it's the end of the world. She always did have great timing. She coughs out smoke, passing it back to Marty. He puts his arm around her, her thin body shivering under his touch. This is the end, they can feel it. The Earth is angry at them, at humanity. When their world should go black, everything shifts. They wake up in the cabin, in Marty's room, Dana tucked under his arm, her head nestled under his chin, feeling as if they'd slept for weeks. At first, they think it's heaven. But they walk about unsure, they check and the cameras are still there, the basement door lies untouched-somewhere, people are still watching them. There's a noise and Dana latches onto Marty, waiting anxiously for the Buckners to come marching through the door, axes and shackles and all. Instead Jules skips in, pulling Curt behind her. Curt has his hands full of suitcases, Jules is carrying liquor bottles. Dana's date stumbles in behind them, tossing a football around. For reasons unknown, she tightens her grasp on Marty's arm. \"How did you guys survive?\" Dana asks, running over to hug her friend. The last time she saw her, she was in pieces. \"It was a long and hard journey,\" Jules said solemnly. \"Marty got very high, we had to suffer through Curt's terrible driving and Holden's fear of speed, but we got through it.\" \"Hey!\" Curt shouted, slapping his girlfriend on the ass. \"That wasn't nice at all.\" \"I'm kidding!\" Jules held her hands up in defense. \"What do you mean, Dana? You were there.\" She looked back towards Marty, retreated towards him. He wrapped his arms around her, their friends staring with questioning looks. \"They don't remember.\" She said. \"I'm going to go put our stuff away.\" Curt said, grabbing his and Jules' suitcases and walking towards the bedroom. \"We get a second chance.\" Marty swallowed, hard. Dana shrugged-he had been right about everything else that had happened, why not this too. They didn't understand, but they weren't about to take anything for granted. \"We can't stay here.\" Dana told everyone, grabbing suitcases and hurrying to the camper. \"I agree with Dana.\" Marty grabbed Holden, pulling him out to the van and starting it up. He honked the horn, letting Curt and Jules come running out, half dressed. There was no need to guess what they had been doing. \"Come on!\" Dana yelled, motioning for them to get in. \"What the hell?\" Jules asked, walking towards her friend. \"What are you doing, we just got here?\" \"We need to leave.\" Marty sighed, revving the engine. \"Marty...\" He thought for a moment. Maybe they would be alright if they stayed. If they kept away from the basement steps, didn't pick up any strange artifacts, and definitely didn't read any latin. No, Marry shook his head. He wasn't taking any chances, especially with Dana around. Jules and Curt could stay if they wanted, but he was getting out of here, Dana too. \"Just get the fuck in,\" Marty added. \"Or we're leaving you.\" Jules and Curt exchanged a glance. \"Just let us grab our stuff.\" Curt said quietly. \"Some vacation this is,\" Holden said, rolling his eyes. \"Don't be a dick.\" Marty told him, tapping his hands on the steering wheel. \"Yeah, when we get out of here, we'll spend the weekend at the beach or something.\" ","Summary":" They're pretty sure they're going to die.

The constant tease of human minds against his own was excruciatingly delightful and the edges of the blades that had been set into his skull shuddered and hummed at the sensation. The slithery, coiled ropes of his appetite had not been sated for nearly three years and he was growing restless. He could feel the unwinding of the world and wished to have a hand in it. The glass cube where they, the Servitors of the Old Gods, should not have been the obstacle it was. It looked innocuous enough; glass and steel fit neatly together so that nothing could get in or out. Not even air. Of course, he had long since gone beyond needing such trivial things. He could smell his own blood and the leather cassock he wore. Nothing else reached him Idly, as he had hundreds of times before, he pressed his will against the glass and steel of the cage. Immediately, old and twisting marks flared into golden light, pressing back against his will and keeping him imprisoned. He withdrew the tendrils of will and wish and turned his mind inward. The sacrifice had all gone wrong, he knew. Oh, he had sensed the death of the first woman. She had been simmering and ripe with desire. A creature of exquisite carnal delight… Her moniker of the Whore had offended him on a level so profound he had been unable to give voice to it, even in his own thoughts. Musings of her so-called corruption had brushed against him from the keepers, those who had once been priests and priestesses to the ancient chthonic gods. He reflected on their imprudence; they were very quick to cast stones against one who sought and took pleasure where she willed but then they were just as quick to watch her revel in her sexuality, in the delight she had taken in her own flesh and nerves. That they, his keepers, were too bound up in the dizzying tangle of guilt-loathing-desire-disgust and unable to simply allow themselves release made the tips of his fingers itch. He could show them. He could teach them. The runes at the seams of his cube flared sharply again. Her death had been acerbic with fear and disgust and he had howled silently at the wasted potential. The sights he could have shown her, the sensations she could have explored… all undone against the sharp and rusted teeth of an ancient and unearthed saw. A saw! A crude instrument meant for labor, not for art. His contempt made the pinpoint lights of white fire flare suddenly in his abyssal eyes. Her death had been a bitter taste in his mouth, sour blood and old sweat against his tongue and teeth. She could have been exposed to the depth and breadth of suffering. She would have, he thought, been the first to embrace the pain and make it her own, reshaping her own fragile human structure into something more befitting for the darkness she would have housed. She was wasted potential for beauty and horror. They had traded a slow and breathtaking erosion of the human soul for the abrupt climax of fear and death. Sloppy work. Sloppy and stupid. He had never been able to understand the Buckner family. Whenever their collective consciousness had brushed his, he had felt immediately weary; their tedious circles of vicious sexual destruction and faith based justifications had been used by countless men and women over ten thousand generation in innumerable religions and cults. It was vulgar. They reveled in inflicting pain, on themselves, each other and on any unwary who had the misfortune to become their prey. But they had not understood it. The little one, Patience, had come close but only in her secret journal. She could have been an astute acolyte, he thought. However both brothers and father were as yet too human to truly understand immensity of the darkness laid at their feet. They were like children, playing in the spume of waves and thinking themselves very bold and very daring but unaware of the full terror of the ocean even as crashed and heaved against their ankles. He had little time for such children. He had felt the fear of the other Sacrifices after the first death. It was a delicate and tightly tuned cord, trilling in near silence; an exposed nerve waiting to be coaxed and shaped by a master's hand. But again, he had felt the bitterness of wasted opportunity. The Buckners were blunt instruments, unable to feel and perceive anything other than their own pleasure. They were no teachers. They reveled in the agony and the fear of their victims but did not strive to enlighten. They had hammered at the walls of their quarry's hiding place, pulpy flesh that had been too long dead to experience anything but the faintest echo of pain. When they had finally gained entrance, they had proved impotent; unable to cause anything but disgust-fear in the chosen sacrifices. Tedium. He had felt with a sharpening of interest when the blood sacrifice of the Fool was given without any accompanying death. But he had thought then that it would be a matter of time. The boy might have survived for now but he was, after all, the Fool. Deep within the darkness of the ever-shuffling machinery and far below the pounding feet and heart of the sacrifices he wondered. He had disdained calling the first victim the Whore after all. He had decided to keep quiet and close tabs on this wayward sacrifice as the game progressed. He was smug in his knowledge that, had he and his acolytes been the ones chosen the Fool would have soon become part of their ranks. Though the Fool's mind had been hazy with whatever intoxicants he continued to feed his system, it had been sharp enough to resist the fumes and gasses the Priests continued to use to sway the odds in their favor. The death of the Athlete had been a slap in the face. It had been little more than an accident, a sudden blaring light in his eyes before death had gathered him up and spirited him away. There had been no pain, little fear and no enlightenment. As the Virgin (and again he felt that sharp sense of offense at such an unworthy term for such stunning flesh) and the Scholar had fled from the precipice, their fear had settled. It had become a slow and sullen flow of despair. Exhaustion had taken over then, exhaustion and the need to buoy each other with hope. It would have been the time that, had he been the chosen nightmare, he would have allowed them a reprieve, a moment to gather their wits and heart again; there was no point in driving the human soul to the pinnacle of sensation if the flesh was too exhausted to feel. The Buckners had, apparently, felt differently. As with the Athlete, the Scholar's death had been bitter and exhausting disappointment. Pain, yes there had been pain. But less than Father Buckner would have wanted. The scythe he favored had severed most of the Scholar's nerves, had deadened an already weary body with barely a brush of true torment. And then the Virgin was left. Oh, her fear had been piquant; at this point ripe and full and ready to burst against the lips of any lucky enough to truly savor it. She had escaped Father Buckner who yet remained trapped in a metal box at the bottom of a fathoms deep lake. Her subsequent escape and brief respite had been, for the Priests and Priestesses, the end of their night. In his glass cage, looking into the faces of other monsters he felt their elation, relief and self-congratulatory revelry. For them, it was done. But he knew something that they had not yet learned. The Fool still lived. It was he who saved the Virgin from Judah Buckner who, with all of the delicacy of a bear trap, was attempting to drive her to new heights of fear and terror. She was too far gone to feel anything but an overwhelming sense of confusion and frustration, her mind uncoupling from her body as one question railed against the insides of her mind. He had heard it, of course, as he heard all of their screaming, shrieking, terror-filled thoughts. This one was simple and it was often the one the sacrifices were all left with before they finally died. Why? He would have told her, had he been there; had he been her guide to the new world of pain and fear. He had even attempted to reach out to her, to inflict his own brand of mercy on the red-tinged thoughts of the dying Virgin. But the wards on his prison had kept him pent and he had resumed his passive speculation. The Fool had been the hero. The Fool had lived, had rescued the Virgin… and now… Now they were within the facility. He felt them growing nearer, felt her confusion beginning to fade away, felt her awareness of the situation slowly crystallize to understanding. He would, he suddenly felt, be her guide into the world of true terror after all. He had summoned the Requiem Sphere to him. The glyphs at the borders of the glass flared sharply but could not stop the small, metal puzzle from answering his call. It fell into the cup of his awaiting hands and warmed pallid flesh with the remembered heat of a living, human touch. The Athlete has almost summoned him, after all. And then she was there. The Virgin, blood-smeared, bruised and close to mental and emotional collapse, and as she stared at him he felt her dawning realization. Rage, horror and a shrieking injustice at what had been inflicted on her and her friends that grew far, far, far below her conscious mind. She was aware of it only as a hot, dull throbbing pain at the base of her skull. She stepped forward, her blood-and-sweat matted hair hanging in limp ropes around her pale face. The buzzing fluorescent lights threw shadows harsh and ashy over skin that should have been dotingly flayed and opened. There was such potential in her! He matched her step until they were separated only by glass, the warding spells on his side glowing in soft warning at his proximity. It was an intimate distance, he thought as he stared down at her. She looked up at him, her hazy eyes beginning to clear. He saw the Fool turn out of the corner of his vision, felt the sudden fear and then, amusingly, frustration. He, at least, had gone past fear. Through spells and runes and glass he looked down at her, down at her bruised and battered face and into the forge of her will. He clenched his teeth, a muscle in his jaw jumping spasmodically, nostrils flaring as he watched her, as if her could drink down the scent of her through airtight glass. Her anger gave her will, her will drove her fears to new heights as the need to survive returned to her battered and abused limbs. She spoke then, but not through the glass, not to him but to the Fool. Explaining what she had gleaned, what she now understood. He watched her lips form the words, They made us choose. Ah, but what a glorious creature she could have become. He could have taught her much, could have helped her inflict such damage on the rest of the world… on the Priests and Priestesses that had so long been out of his reach. Her rage had been sudden and sharp, an abrupt heat to all of the sweetness of her pain and all of the salt of her fear. She had railed against him, against the glass. Her hands had been had been badly cut, the long gouges only just clotting. With her sudden onslaught they broke open and blood spattered and smeared; a living counterpoint to the agony that had broken over her. He watched her unblinking, unchanging and wanted . He felt a distant and weak form of sympathy for her. Confusion was ever the hardest burden to bear. She had been given nothing, had only figured out through her own temerity and the desperate need to find some meaning in all of her suffering, in all of the death she had witnessed. She had screamed, oblivious to the tears brightening in her eyes, but her voice couldn't penetrate the glass. The pain and fear could. He drank of that greedily. It was a rich and heady wine and he seethed that so much of it had been so badly wasted. When the mechanism of the cages whirred back into life, he stepped back, watching as she was shuffled and rearranged like the rest of them. Now that his attention wasn't focused so tightly on her, he could feel the mad scramble and alarm of the Priests and their servitors. They had become aware of the Fool then, and of the invasion of the menagerie and now they hastened to repair the damage before it could undo them all. The bitterness of not being summoned was sharper now, his disappointment turned to something like rage. With such glorious canvases wasted on the dull machinations of the Buckner Family…! It was travesty and an offense to his senses. He could have given them (her) enlightenment; could have opened them to the agony of pleasure, exposing bone and flesh and muscle to the sensuous indulgence of ecstasy beyond any human endurance. He closed his eyes and toyed with the idea of remaking their frames… or rather, allowing them to remake themselves in the image of Lazarus, she who ruled the Maze of Hell. He was her favored son and most devoted disciple and he would have been delighted to expose the Virgin and the Fool –and to lesser degrees the others—to the terrific wonder of the Goddess of Anguish. He felt it then when the entire machinery changed its ever-shifting patterns. It stopped shuffling and reshuffling and suddenly he felt all of the creatures, all of the nightmares within their glass prisons begin to descend towards the demesne of the Priests. His eyes snapped open. She had released them. She had released everything. She had released him. He shuddered, elated and impressed. She had given up on the idea of life. Whether she lived or died now, she would never go back to what she was. She was as much monster now as the rest of them and in her own way would celebrate it. If she lived through the night, he swore to himself that he would seek her out and offer to show her all the delights and horrors that he had learned over the millennia. With a wry smile that never made it to his mouth, he thought that perhaps she would be able to instruct him on a few points in return. But then he felt the wards on his cage falter, felt the screams tuning in the air like some vast orchestra. He could smell blood, heady and thick and set his thoughts of the Virgin aside… for the moment. Before he could be teacher to her, he must first purge his frustrations on his keepers. It would not do to bring anger or passion to their next encounter. With a soft, heralding chime of a bell, the doors of his prison slid open and he stepped into the bloodbath that was prelude to the end of the world.

Well, I have a huge crush on Marty but I know my parents wouldn't approve of dating a stoner. Then there's Nick, he was a stranger guy. He was smart but never wanted to do his work. He was also super quiet. \"Tayla!\" Sandy shouted at the front door. \"I'm almost done!\" I yelled back at her. I smelt weed and looked out the window and saw Marty smoking out of his bong. He looked adorable. His hair was long, and wavy. He was clean of no beard and had blue eyes. He dressed decently. I had to get him off of my mind. I knew he'd never like someone like me. I finished packing and lugged the suitcase down the stairs. Zak was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs. \"Finally! I hear Marty is really into you.\" He said chuckling. \"Shut up and leave it alone!\" I added pushing him out of the way and making my way outside into the light. My eyes looked right at Marty but his focus was on Sally. Zak bumped into me and I stumbled down the stairs. I sighed while walking past Marty and climbed onto the trailer where Nick was in the drivers seat. \"Good Morning Sleepy Head!\" He said smiling. I grabbed my seat and pulled out my galaxy and went on Wattpad. I read some stories as people board. My mind couldn't focus when Marty came and sat a cross from me. \"Hey Tayla, what are you doing on this fine morning?\" He said rolling his joints. \"Uh, I'm just reading some Fanfiction.\" I added blushing hard. \"Well that's nice...\" He stated as he moved away. My hole face expression changed. I looked at Zak and he looked at me and shrugged his shoulders. Zak gave me the one minute finger and went to the back of the trailer. I tried listening but I couldn't hear anything. A few tears fell from my face and Sally noticed. \"Aw, Tayla...\" She stated get close to me. I got up and ran into the bathroom. I heard Zak and Marty walk by and I started to cry. 5 minutes later I heard a knock on the door. \"Tayla, come on... Please come out.\" Zak said sounding upset. \"No..\" I stated. He walked away and I unlocked the door and opened it. My eyes looked at the group and they were all by Nick talking so I ran into the bed room. I heard Zak talking to Marty about me. Soon enough, I heard footsteps walking closer and closer to the room. \"Hey, guys! She's out of the bathroom!\" Marty said \"Marty, check the back!\" she yelled. I heard footsteps walk towards the door and hear the door squeak open. He walked closer to me and sat on the bed. \"Tayla\" He began. \"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. It's just I really don't know you enough to actually have a relationship. I hope you can forgive me for that and hope we can still be friends.\" Those words hurt me a lot. I rolled over and looked at him. My makeup running down my eyes and my lip quivering. His expression changed quickly. He put his hand on my hand and rubbed it. \"It's because I'm different. You don't like me because I'm not a stoner. I like you so much, and what you said just now literally broke me. I hope you know that Marty.\" I stated looking away from him. \"Tayla, come on.

Six ways the world didn't end, plus one. Cabin in the Woods fanfic. 1.4k Trope deconstruction for the win. You gotta love Joss. 6. Turn left (the one where she chooses) Dana puts two bullets in Marty, then one in her head. We live in the world we make. It's not worth it. 5. You made us choose how we died (the optimistic one) \"I name you a fool.\" Says Dana. Shifting the gun from Marty to the woman who engineered all of this, lips curling into a twist. The moment between the bullet and her heart is enough for her eyes to widen. The director has enough time to scream as she stumbles over the edge. The rumbling of the earth stops and the fool's outline shimmers with blood. Marty yanks her out of the way of the werewolf and they run, hand in hand, hearts pounding. They can still hear the slaughter going on behind them but outside, outside the sun is rising. 4. The one where she chooses (and lives with it) Dana empties the clip in to Marty, hands shaking, head spinning. The earth stops moving. She just saved the world but it doesn't feel like that. Feels like she just murdered the only friend she had left. The director lays a hand on her shoulder says, \"let's get you cleaned up.\" It's easy to whip the gun around into her head, easier still to leave the woman unconscious on the ground. There's what looks like a werewolf eyeing them hungrily, so she backs away slowly. Its more interested is the Director then her so she walks away. Finds the access tunnels and climbs out, slowly, painfully. It's an hour and a half on foot to the nearest town. There's a diner she goes into. She takes a seat and the waitress puts a hand on her shoulder gentle-like. \"Sweetheart, you need help?\" Dana's gore splattered and numb. There's a tv on overhead, tuned to the news. War in the Middle East, drug rings in South America, the oncoming energy crisis. The only other customer asks his waiter to change the channel. He doesn't need this depressing shit before breakfast. This is the world they died for? She took too long to respond and waitress has left, probably gone to call the police. She'll be gone by the time the waitress comes back. 3. Heroes don't kill anybody but themselves (the genre savvy says) \"It's easier\" Marty says offering Dana the gun \"with this.\" She shudders and pushes it away. \"I'd rather die.\" He laughs. \"If this were a movie you'd live to regret that.\" Oh she does. The director isn't carrying a gun. Can't carry a gun if what they've read between the lines is correct. This is about choice. They have to choose, ignore the old man at the gas station, to continue up the road, how they die. The bitch is telling them you or the world. And there's a choice. Of course there's a fucking choice. Marty has the gun still in hand. She wants him to love every soul in the world but really it's come down to this. Is Dana worth dying for? There isn't time to assess the pros and cons. 'Cause he could go on for hours about the how the world is ending and how it's time to for a new species but talking is not the same thing as doing, not doing. Suicide. Say the word like he means it because otherwise it's not a choice. Should he soften it? Call it martyrdom. Killing yourself for the sake of the world. Sounds like the sort of shit a hero would do. He's not, forever too aware of the things that should stop him. The ground is rumbling beneath his feet. Marty thinks of his mother. She'll be asleep when the sun rises. Sleeping through the apocalypse. Dana's standing across from him, her eyes wide. The director wants him to love the whole damn world but it's this- a girl who's covered in blood and the thought of his mother sleeping through the giant evil gods apocalypse. Gun to his head and this is a choice. 2. Do not go gently (goodnight) She's bleeding, from the neck. He wants to apologize for that, the werewolf and choosing to let the world end. He's bleeding too, and the world's going fuzzy round the edges. Hell of a night. He's cold, so is she leaning against him. Jules, if she were still alive, would babbling about blood loss and shock, pre-med and the fuckers reduced her to the whore. He fumbles for the joint he knows is tucked away in his jeans, fumbles the lighter even more. It drops from his hands and he realizes he can't feel them. Beside him, Dana reaches for the lighter, slow, and clumsy, not like herself at all. She lights the joint with an effort and takes a hit. Passes it to him. His vision has tunneled down to her hand and the joint. Nothing left. Wants to say something but the words trip over his tongue. His heart slows, stutters, stops. This is the absence of choice. 1. You made us choose how we died (the pessimistic one) Japan maintains it's perfect record. The control room gets the news as Marty is dying off screen. They pop champagne bottles because this doesn't matter anymore, and leave the victims unmonitored until the emergency sirens sound as the base has been breached. They glance to the screens and see the survivors. There have been base breaches before, but never here. Protocol has the manager choosing what to do with them. Hadley lifts the bottle and salutes their screen, and tells the operators to drop them in the entrance hall. Says, \"Keep the doors closed til we get there.\" A band of the security men and the controllers gather round the door. Security keeps guns leveled on the elevator and it dings as it opens out of place in the sterile halls. They offer the kids hard liquor, a toast to their deaths becoming unnecessary. The girl looks like she'll be sick, but the boy clamps a hand around her arm and takes the glass, toasts them with a cold smile. He hands it off to her and she knocks it back a little too fast. They get drunk in a corner of the control room and when the intern tries to hit on Dana, Marty snarls and shoves his way in between the two of them. They're both shaking and drunk, and they understand this was a choice. The controllers could have lit up the elevator as soon as it arrived but they didn't and they are going to live. So is the world. 0. Hope is a thing with feathers (and your wings are broken) The giants rise but they live. Maybethey were too close to the epicenter to be noticed, ants too small to be crushed. Maybe this is their idea of mercy. The gods will not kill those who release the gods. He was holding her hand when the world ended. They haven't let go yet. They hike out of what used to be the woods, flattened now, and find the remains of a town. She hot-wires a car and he's impressed. They hit the road, what's left of them headed south for their parents' homes. He's there when they find the remains of her parents. She's there when they find the remains of his. They hold on. The survivors of the apocalypse are gathering east in what used to be Colorado. It's not much, the radios say, but there's food, shelter. The car Dana hot-wired died a week ago and she could start another but it's hard to find an uncrushed car so they're on foot until future notice. Backpacking across the end of the world. They don't talk about the others but this is the shit they planned for back in college, more zombie apocalypse then giant evil gods but it's close enough. The plans translate even if the monsters are different. It's a month on foot, less if they can find a car. Two weeks in and a car they should have heard miles ago, in the unnaturally silent brave new world, pulls up along side them, rolls down the window. The first living they've seen since the world ended stare at them. \"Jesus,\" the woman says \"You're just kids.\" Her hand has already found his. And the look they share is dripping with irony. They don't say they made us choose how we died , that it was the world, or us and we chose ourselves . They don't apologize for their choice. They do say hello, introduce themselves, and hitch a ride south. They survive. And his hand never leaves hers. ","Summary":" Title: turn left Summary: It's about choice.

She and her 4 friends; Mary, Jake, Zach and Alex had gone to Mary's aunt's remote cabin in the woods for the weekend. However, the creepy gas attendant back in the gas station wasn't the best part of the trip. However, it was worth it, 3 days of fun, love and insanity, all on their own. Something seemed pretty off about how everything was going, and she decided to ignore it. This would prove to be a mistake…. The door was slammed open to reveal the cabin's interior – Basics, fireplace, several bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, the works. However, the wolf head trophy on the wall seemed to seriously freak Zach out. There was a patch of wood planks that seemed a little higher than the others on the floor. ''Hey guys…'', Jake murmured, '' This cabin is freaking me out….why are there multiple bedrooms if only your aunt and uncle lived here..?'' ''Don't be a baby, Jake'', Mary said. However, that question had been nagging at the back of her mind as well, but she wasn't about to admit it. ************************************************** *********************************** ''Everything is going according to plans, the lambs have passed the gate, they have come to the killing floor…'', Mordecai grumbled through the microphone. ''Are you just going to keep saying that shit over and over until you die?'', asked Hadley. Sitterson chuckled. He had no idea how the Story Department had found this old coot, and he didn't exactly want to find out the answer. He glanced over at the betting board, before remembering. ''Alright folks, last chance to bet! This cash wad isn't going to win itself!'' Sitterson shouted, before pausing. ''Whoa whoa whoa, Maintenance, why do you vote for the same thing every year? For this year, change your vote or it doesn't count'' Sitterson said to the Maintenance team. Maintenance sighed, erased their name, and put it somewhere else on the board. ************************************************** *********************************** Jane sauntered over to the living room to dance with the rest of the group, before a loud ''thwang!'' echoed through the Cabin. The unusual slightly taller planks had swung up, revealing a cellar of sorts. The group looked at each other simultaneously, before slowly starting to head inside. There hundreds of weird artifacts on tables throughout the cellar; a white mask, a tapestry with a faded unicorn on it, a diary, film reels, a wedding dress, a rocking horse, a chunk of rock, a foreign dagger, and many, many more. Zach picked up the diary, and called everyone over….. ************************************************** *********************************** Maintenance were glaring holes into Sitterson now, they had certainly missed their chance of winning for listening to ''Mr. Control''. However, the teenager stopped reading the diary…. Zach had stopped reading up to the point to ''husband's bulge''. He beaned the book over a table, and it crashed into a chest full of gas masks and tonics. ************************************************** *********************************** A monitor instantly switched to the cube prisons, where the Buckners and Mutants winced in pain over the maltreatment of their items. Sitterson was twinged with annoyance by now, nobody before had hurt their Monsters like that. ''Send a Wrangler Bio-Med Assistance squadron to Elevators….057 and 453.'' Sitterson mumbled through the microphone, voice tinted with stress. ************************************************** *********************************** A loud ''PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRPPPP'' echoed through the cabin's cellar. Now twice..thrice…10 times in a row before Jake was calmed down, and stopped from blowing the conch shell. ''You could go deaf from all that noise!'', Zach yelled. ''Well SORRY, Mr. Wants To Go Home!'', yelled back Jake, who pushed Zach into a table, vibrating a snakeskin, a rubber lizard, and a surgical knife… ************************************************** *********************************** From the lake, 10 large hairy and flabby forms appeared swimming towards the Cabin…..a gigantic serpentine shadow slinked towards the cabin as well….scaly humanoid footprints were beginning to be made in a track trail towards the Cabin…3 humanoid figures began slowly strutting towards the Cabin's light…it was a new event… ************************************************** *********************************** The Control room had gone silent. Never, in the history of the American Branch, had multiple Monsters been summoned. It was an honor…a milestone… ''WE HAVE WINNERS!'' shouted Sitterson, ''Zoology, identify our Monstrous victors!'' A woman in a lab coat stood up and began to speak, Sitterson quieting the room. ''10 Mermen….'', Hadley shouted in excitement so loud it hurt the Zoology Woman's ears, '' the Giant Snake…Reptilius….and the Doctors!'' Maintenace roared in outrage. They were so stupid in choosing the Dismemberment Goblins. Who would open a Chinese box full of comic books? Nobody, that's who. ''Zoology, Hadley, Wranglers, and Ronald the Intern, you split the pot!'' yelled Sitterson, before slowly giving out the equal wads of cash. ************************************************** *********************************** ''We've got a perfectly good lake, and we don't swim!?'' yelled Zach, before grabbing Mary and shoving her into the lake, and falling in himself. They laughed, but Mary punched Zach in playful annoyance. ''Marco'' ''Polo'' ''Marco'' ''Pol—'' Mary suddenly disappeared under the water, hidden from view. ''Mary?...Mary?...MARY?'' Mary's hair slowly began showing up under the water, Zach yanked it up to see her…..and got half her body from the stomach up. Zach screamed, before shoving the corpse back in. He slowly saw blurs swimming at him, before a toothy maw enveloped his face, and shoved him under… ************************************************** *********************************** Hadley grinned in drunken happiness as the blood spurted into the air like a geyser from one of the Mermen's blowholes from underwater. Finally, the Mermen had been picked…emphasis on MerMEN, due to the betting board's listing, he only thought there was A Merman. This was a whole lot better. ************************************************** *********************************** Jake looked out the window towards the lake, just in time to see the geyser go back under the water. Jake rubbed his eyes, and saw the regular water, but there was a strange tint to it….he decided to investigate. ''Alex, get your ass over here, you need to come outside!'', yelled Jake. Alex was about to refuse, but there was a sudden change of air, a strong smell, then he agreed and headed outside. Jake noticed the smell of meat, and noticed it emanated from the lake. He dipped his hand inside, and ended up picking up a surprise. ''HOLY SHIT'', he yelled, as he dropped Zach's forearm. It had been basically torn off…no, BITTEN off. But what could've done that? There are no sharks OR crocodiles or gators in this area. As if karma wanted to answer his question, a webbed hand latched onto his calf. Both young men yelled as the Mermen began emerging from the lake. Alex was suddenly pounced on by a Merman, and was dragged away. Jake began running back to the Cabin… The grenade exploded, killing the Merman, and setting off a fire in his legs…severing them. He yelled in pain…before spotting 3 human figures walking towards him, in doctor gear. ''Oh please, th….'' The thankfulness died In his throat, as their smocks were covered in blood, and their eyelids were somehow sewn shut. ''Do not fear us'', they spoke in unison, ''We are the cure''. On the mark of ''cure'', they began cutting into Alex's ribcage, removing organs and placing them in their black medical bag. The last thing Alex felt was a scalpel plunging into his jugular… ************************************************** *********************************** The progress was going well so far…the Whore, Scholar and Fool were down for the count, however, so was a Merman, who was getting a funeral on Tuesday by Hadley's forced request. Sitterson grinned at the thought of burying a Merman….there weren't many Monsters killed in the line of Ritual duty. Only a Doctor, said Merman, 2 Zombies, and a Dismemberment Goblin. ************************************************** *********************************** Jake slammed the door shut as soon as he got in. ''BARRICADE, BARRICADE NOW'', he ordered. ''Why? Where's Alex, Zach, and Mary?'' Jane asked. ''They're GONE, now help me barricade!'' replied Jake. ''What? I'm not leaving without them!'', she yelled back, and opened the door….to the Doctors, 3 Mermen, and Reptilius. A Doctor casually tossed her Alex's arm. She instantly slammed the door, activated the locks, and ran to her room. However, a side of the Cabin suddenly exploded open, revealing the Giant Snake's gaping maw. The force threw Jane into a wall against her room, knocking her out cold. Jake ran over to her, but then a Doctor's hand burst through the glass window, and dragged him outside. The night was given the sound of Jake's screaming and the maniacal cackling of Doctors, gargle of Mermen, hiss of Snakes, and the roar of Reptilius. ************************************************** *********************************** ''—As it ever was'', Hadley echoed the end of Sitterson's prayer. The Ritual was complete. However, the real bitch would be capturing the Monsters back…eh, they had Wranglers for that. ","Summary":" Fall leaves crunched under Jane's feet.

They closed their eyes. It would be over soon. For them, maybe for all mankind. \"For Christ's sake COME ON!\" Marty and Dana opened their eyes to see Ronald the intern racing through the chamber. He hit a hidden switch on the wall and the stone panel slid back to reveal a shiny metal door with the words 'Director's Escape Pod' embossed on the metal. He opened it and jumped in, frantically beckoning them to join him. Dana looked at Marty who shrugged at her in return. He picked her up and carried her across the chamber, Ronald pulling them inside and slamming the door behind them just in time to severe the fingers of the razor taloned hand which followed. \"FUCK YOU MANBAT!\" he roared triumphantly as the still twitching digits fell to the floor of the capsule. Then there was noise and light, then blackness. Marty picked himself up off the floor and raised himself unsteadily to his feet, bracing his hands against the metal sides of the capsule. Ronald was staring out of the porthole in the door and speaking intently into a radio mounted onto the side of their craft. \"Streetcar calling almighty, streetcar calling almighty….\" He followed Ronald's gaze, realising for the first time that they were floating hundreds of feet in the air, suspended by a trio of massive parachutes deployed above them. He was just in time to see an enormous demonic hand emerge from the ground beneath the cabin and smash it to smithereens. The creatures which erupted from the soil after it looked like nothing he had ever seen in his worst drug induced nightmares, a cross between giant octopuses, dinosaurs and every other conceivable monster that had ever haunted the dreams of man, standing hundreds of feet tall. One noticed the escape pod and idly reached out to take it into one enormous tendril spouting hand, as if curious at this new flying oddity. In spite of himself Marty quailed backwards, glad that Dana was still lying unconscious on the floor. The hand disappeared in a flash of light followed a second later by an explosion so loud it seemed to rattle the fillings in Marty's head. He looked back at the hellgod whose demonic features were now filled with what was undeniably surprise as it held the bloodied and smoking stump where its' hand had once been up for examination, the other hellgods staring at it with equal shock. It let out a piercing scream which made Marty's insides twist in agony but it was silenced in an instant as its' head exploded in an avalanche of rubbery flesh and vile multi-coloured fluids. It seemed to take forever to fall to the ground, Marty able to feel as well as hear the sound of the massive impact. \"Yeah, how'd you like that you DEMONIC FUCKS!\" Ronald yelled. \"Welcome to the 21st century!\" Suddenly the air was full of streaks of light and fire, the flailing hellgods disappearing behind a vast wall of smoke, their inhuman screams still audible over the thunder of the barrage. Severed limbs and tentacles, some still ablaze were thrown clear by the impact of the missiles. \"Wow, jumbo calamari\" observed Marty. The impact of the escape pod striking the ground jarred him off his feet. Ronald popped the hatch and then helped Marty get Dana to her feet and drag her outside, the fresh air bringing her around again. She opened her eyes to find the sky filled with helicopters. \"Second wave\" Ronald observed. He looked with foreboding at the woods, dark and ominous even in the light of the fresh dawn. \"Let's get out of here, the critters are still out there somewhere\" He began to walk in the direction which the helicopters had come from. Eventually Dana and Marty followed him. One year later. He kicked back in his chair taking a long draw from his reefer. No one would ever convince him that it was anywhere near as good now that they'd legalised it. That said he was quite partial to some of Starbucks flavoured brands. Well, he'd said civilisation needed to be brought down and rebuilt again, having to pay tax on his weed wasn't really what he had in mind. He flicked on the news. \"In further news Congress today passed legislation to reintroduce compulsory prayer at all schools. This brings the US into line with the British Commonwealth and continental Europe where the Pope and Archbishop of Canterbury met yesterday to begin the formal handover of power from the Christian Federation back to secular authorities. The Pope will begin a whistle-stop tour of North America next week, the first for the Pontiff since assuming the role last month. A spokesman for the church commented that the entire nation is looking forward to greeting her. In related news authorities in Salem have announced an entire week free of witch burnings in the New England area. We'll be right back with a report on the Texas family who killed a giant supernatural snake and have now opened their own leather emporium and Arkansas launching their first statewide zombie hunting day\" The broadcast cut to a terrified looking family besieged in their house by a multitude of varied monsters, the father frantically rifling through his government issue 'Supernatural survival kit' for the correct countermeasure, a bright orange coloured plastic box with the words 'DON'T PANIC!' stamped helpfully on the side. The monsters fled at the sight of the pitchman walking into the centre of the scene, a man with a gleaming smile and a tan twice as bright. \"Are you confident that your government issue anti-monster kit is enough? What price do you put on your family and immortal soul?\" The scene switched to the same family happily shopping at a cavernous store filled with equally enthusiastic customers. Over them hung a giant cardboard cut-out of the pitchman using a cross to hammer a generic monster. \"Come to Jerry's Crucifix Store for all your anti-occult needs. We've got stakes, silver bullets in every calibre you can imagine, holy water blessed by the representatives of all major religions, talismans, flamethrowers, chainsaws, mystic daggers, blessed swords, sacred texts, charm bracelets, anti-charm bracelets, chicken feet so fresh they're still in the chicken, guns guns guns and every sort of grenade under the sun. If evil can think of it, we've got something to kick its' ass! At Jerry's Crucifix Store our motto is 'Our prices won't be beaten and you won't get eaten!\" He changed the channel. It was a talk show. One guest had his face pixilated, wearing the t-shirt of the 27/30 movement, demanding the ethical treatment of werewolves. You didn't need a t-shirt to know that the other was a sexy witch. The skimpy black lingerie, matching high heels, beautiful face and body a pornstar would die for left little room for doubt. Just for good measure she topped it off with a broomstick, black cloak and pointy hat from under which her long black hair flowed. A large black cat stretched contentedly on her lap, purring as it rested on her stockings tops whilst she stroked its' tummy. Eventually he was able to tear his eyes away from her long enough to concentrate on what the man was saying. \"90% of the time I'm as human as the rest as you. I live, I feel, I breathe, hell I coach little league. 10% of the time I lock myself up so that I don't hurt people. I am not a monster, I keep the wolf in check. But I shouldn't have to. With a homeland I could run free with the rest of the pack and never hurt a soul. Poison me and I die, tickle me and I laugh, cut me and I bleed\" It was her turn to speak \"We sexy witches are no threat to mankind. We just want to be left alone. All we need is a homeland, a refuge. Hawaii, Tasmania, Madagascar, all devastated in the war. We could rebuild them, make a world of our own. \"But some of the species are inherently evil!\" the interviewer protested. \"And some aren't\" the man objected. He gestured to the sexy witch whose nametag gave her name as Miranda May \"We're not. The unicorns aren't. The sasquatch aren't. Even the vampires only need to feed and they've got fetishists queuing up around the block to let them bleed them. We don't need to fight, we can all co-exist\" He turned back to the news. Ronald looked uncomfortable in his suit and tie, bathed under the bright lights of the multiple press cameras surrounding him. The capitol building was still being rebuilt, scaffolding and workmen clearly visible in the background. You could just make out the baying of the crowd outside held back by hordes of military police in riot gear. The representative for Ohio went first. \"Mr McDonald we have read your report with interest. I must ask you how it feels to be responsible for the global deaths of 5 billion people?\" Ronald adjusted his tie and lent forwards \"Congresswoman Sylvester I would not know. My organisation saved the lives of those 5 billion people not to mention the one and a half billion who remain\" There was uproar in the chamber and cries of 'Shame'. Sylvester let the tumult die down then continued \"Mr McDonald your organisation has been responsible for the brutal and torturous murder of millions of people over thousands of years, reaching right back into recorded history. And that was BEFORE you unleashed the unspeakable horrors that have massacred the Earth's population over the last year\" Ronald took a sip of water before replying. \"Congresswoman we never released any monsters. By making the sacrifices as we did we kept the hellgods placated whilst mankind developed to the degree that we were finally able to defeat them. Had we not done so you, your ancestors and everyone in this room would not be here because humanity would have been exterminated thousands of years ago, human civilization would never even have existed. We were able to defeat the hellgods at terrible price because we appeased them until we were ready to take them on. Imagine had we been forced to fight them without smart weaponry, without aircraft and nuclear fission? I make no apologies for ensuring the survival of mankind and saving billions. Every great figure in history has participated in the necessary evil of our conspiracy. It is sheer hypocrisy to be criticized for being forced to make sacrifices for the greater good by those whose lives we saved\" The uproar in the chamber almost drowned out by the sound of the car arriving. Marty switched off the TV and went to the door, checking first on his cctv. You still had to be careful, there were still plenty of monsters about even after the destruction of the last of the hellgods, hunted down by submarines as they sought refuge in the oceans depths. \"Hey babe\" he greeted Dana, kissing her passionately. \"Do you want some tea or should we just…?\" She shook her head and took his hand, leading him down to the basement. As she walked she stripped off her t-shirt, shoes and jeans, folding them neatly into a pile before adding her underwear. She had long since lost any embarrassment of appearing naked before Marty, even before they had become lovers. She walked into the cage and he closed the door behind her, locking it securely and checking it was properly shut. They waited together for a moment, neither knowing what to say. \"Do you want me to bring me you a TV or…?\" \"Just go Marty\" she told him \"You know I don't like you to see me….see me when it happens\" He nodded and made his way upstairs. Werewolf keeper was a weird way to spend the holiday weekend but in fairness he'd had weirder.

Even as the ceiling rained down upon them and the floor cracked heavily at their feet, she could still feel herself fading away. In a strange way, she was almost grateful for that. Hopefully she wouldn't have to see it end- see him end. Marty tightened his hold on her and she felt the despair well up again at the injustice of it all. The cards had been stacked against them from the beginning…and now it was just hopeless. She let her head drop down and her eyes clenched shut. She felt him curve his body into hers, trying to almost huddle against whatever was rumbling beneath them. It wouldn't be too long now… The stones broke upwards and she knew it was going to happen now. The trembling was so violent now and she took one last breath before- \" Dana?! Maaar-tyyy! \" Her eyes flew open. Immediately she was blinded by light and the first thing she noticed after blinking a couple of times was the endless amounts of green in front of her. They were back in the woods. A gasp left her as she turned to look at Marty, who was already staring confusedly back at her. His face was clean and any trace of the Hell they'd been through had been wiped off completely, as though it had never happened. She realized belatedly that her own injuries seemed to have vanished and she looked down to check. Nothing. No blood, no torn flesh, nothing at all- just smooth skin and perfectly intact clothes. Her head began to spin and she lifted a hand to steady herself. \"Wha-?\" she began before she was interrupted by someone calling their names again. She had forgotten about that after their state of apparel had caught her eye. \" Marty! Dana! \" The voice was louder and more insistent this time around, almost desperate. Dana glanced at Marty, confused as to what to do. He shrugged helplessly back at her, seeming to still be in a daze. \"Are we dead?\" she croaked, her voice breaking on the last word. He couldn't answer her. He didn't know how. She took a deep breath before heaving herself to her feet, her hand still firmly entwined with his. He quickly followed her example, and they hurried to follow the voice- which led back to the cabin. Dana felt herself pause right before the trees opened to the clearing. What was she expecting to greet her past the foliage? After everything she had seen, everything that had occurred at this place, could she really handle anything more? Marty sensed her hesitancy and gently squeezed her hand. Her eyes found his and she was thankful, not for the first time, that it was him with her during all of this. She felt her resolve strengthening, remembering that they had faced so much already- what's a little more? She took a deep breath and they walked out into the clearing. \"Dana! Marty!\" Marty let out a strangled yelp next to her and she felt the air leave her lungs. \" …Jules ?\" she called out weakly. Because it was. There her friend stood, her head intact and no wounds discernible on her body. Her hair was surprisingly dark again and she looked sufficiently as freaked out as they did. Jules spun on her heel to yell at the occupants back in the cabin that they were here, before turning back to them. \"Where-?\" she began, but Dana was already running full speed. She crashed into her friend, almost knocking them both off their feet onto the porch. But she had to make sure this was real. All she could do was cling to Jules as tightly as could, praying this wasn't a dream. Jules hugged her back just as fiercely and Dana pushed down the lump in her throat as she tried not to cry. Not even 10 hours ago she had held her best friend's decapitated head in her hands, and now Jules was alive and the apocalypse didn't happen and nothing made sense anymore. Dana fought to hold the tears back but holding Jules in her arms was forcing everything that had happened to finally hit her. She took a deep breath before pulling away, leaving at least one hand on her friend's arm, just in case. Jules beat her to asking the question: \"What the hell is going on? Where were you guys? We just woke up in the cabin like nothing had happened and-?\" She broke off, her hand making wild gestures in the air as she struggled to find words. Curt and Holden almost barreled out the door, crowding next to Jules to take both her and Marty in with their own eyes. Marty had, by this point, made his way up to the porch to stand beside Dana. He stared at Jules as though she were a vision, like he couldn't believe his eyes. Dana could tell he didn't know what to make of this either. None of them did, really. She took another breath, \"I have no idea,\" she sighed out. Adrenaline began to pound at her ears and she started feeling jittery as the 'what ifs' flew to mind. What if they weren't really out this mess? What if the Buckners were still out there? What if there was still time to kill them all? \"But I think the main goal right now is to just get the hell out of here while we can,\" she continued. \"Agreed,\"\"I second that\" Curt and Marty overlapped each other, with Jules and Holden nodding their heads in concurrence. All of them turned to rush into the cabin to get their stuff together as quick as possible. Dana was cautious as she walked back to her room, keeping an eye and an ear out for anything weird…or weirder , she supposed. She gently pushed the door open, the creaking holding more weight than ever. It looked the same. Like, the same as when she last left it before the Buckner's showed up. The window was still intact, as was the quilt on top of the two-way mirror on the wall. Everything looked the same as before. It still sent a chill down her spine. She quickly hurried to gather her stuff, shoving it into her bags before leaving the room for hopefully the last time. As she walked down the suddenly long hallway a loud crashing noise brought her to a screeching halt. She dropped her suitcase and immediately dashed towards the noise which seemed to come from Marty's room. A loud rushing noise sounded in her ears as worst case scenarios came to mind. \"Marty?\" she shouted, \" Marty?! \" She burst through his door and stopped. He was standing over a broken lamp on the ground. She looked up from the broken shards to his face, confusion and panic probably warring in her expression. He looked just as frazzled. \"Marty…? What-?\" she gestured towards the mess as she took a hesitant step into the room. \"There-there was a camera in there when-before the, ya know?\" his hands fluttered about him as he tried to get the words out. He stared down at where there wasn't a camera, nor a microphone, nor a cable, coming from the destroyed lamp. There was nothing out of the ordinary. \"I-I thought it might still be there but it's…it's not.\" Dana could only look at him in response. He continued, \"I looked everywhere but the whole room is clean. I-I just…I don't know, Dana. I don't know what's happening.\" His voice hitched as he finally looked up at her. She licked her lips, still unable to find the words to help him. She could only step forward and reach for his hand. \"Come on, Marty. Let's just get out of here.\" He let her lead him out of the room. -x- Before she could leave, she remembered one more thing she had to check. She knew she probably shouldn't, but she didn't think it'd leave her alone if she didn't at least look. She walked over to where the cellar was. There wasn't even a door anymore. Not even evidence that there had been a cellar door, in fact. Her fingers traced the smooth surface as something unnamable welled up inside her. She wondered if it was panic, or just plain fear, or something else entirely. \"Dana?\" Jules's voice called, snapping her back into reality. She had a small moment of madness where she wondered if there was a way she could rip through the floorboards, just to see it the things were still below but someone had hidden the door just in case. But a hand rested upon her shoulder and Dana forced herself to stand. To finally leave this place once and for all. She got the hell out of there, closing the door behind her with relish. The rising sun lit up the sky and the trees, making this place unrecognizable to the nightmare it had been. How could everything still be the same? Curt had the Rambler ready to go, something that still shocked her despite everything else. That vehicle had been at the bottom of the fucking lake. How did it get back up here? How was it even still intact? She still didn't know. And so she got in the Rambler and didn't look back as Curt drove away from the cabin. -x- The speed at which he was going was almost that of last night's, when they had tried escaping the first time. The similarities freaked her out and she couldn't help thinking that this would be the final test. The tunnel had been blown last she saw it- if it was open now… Well, she didn't know what that meant. No one spoke in the van. No one could really voice their thoughts well enough, she supposed. And as they waited with bated breath to see the reality of the situation with the tunnel, the hesitancy to break the tension was very high. Marty sat in front of her but had eyes for no one but the tabletop that he rested his hands upon. Jules, however, looked at everyone in intervals, trying to gauge her friends' expressions and reactions. Holden stood between the driver's seat and the passenger's, helping Curt navigate his way once again, though she was sure Curt knew the way by heart. The scenery flew by even faster than it had the night before and she knew it was because this time they were aware that every second counted to get to that tunnel. She clenched her hands beneath the table as she watched Marty do the same above. She watched as his knuckles grew white and his nails pressed against skin and had to stifle the urge to reach for him. In what seemed like hours, but was rather mere minutes, she finally heard Curt proclaim the pass was finally coming up. She spun in her seat, getting up to look over Holden's shoulder in anticipation. A weird mist seemed to hang around where the entrance was and they couldn't see if it was closed or not. That didn't stop Curt from gunning it, regardless. \"Curt,\" Jules warned, but he kept his foot on the gas. As they were almost upon it, the mist dissipated and the cool darkness of the tunnel surrounded them. She didn't breathe until they were out on the other side, unable to process the fact that they had made it this time. The whole group seemed to exhale at the same time. She flopped back onto her seat, her legs unable to support her anymore. Glancing over at Marty, she took in his ashen face and the small crescent shapes on his palms and the back of his hands. She reached without thinking and gently touched his skin. The way he flinched you would have thought she'd tasered him. She began to retreat but he was already pulling her hand back. So she sat there and allowed herself to breathe some more, feeling the warmth of his hand, and trying to understand what the hell was going on. -x- They drove for about hour or so before Curt announced that they were about to come up on that creepy gas station. And then an idea hit her. She stood up, her mind spinning with these new thoughts. She rested a hand on the back of Curt's seat. \"Pull over,\" she ordered. Curt shot her a look of disbelief, as did Jules. \"What?\" Curt asked, \"Are you crazy? Why-?\" \"Just do it,\" her tone leaving no more room for question. She then moved away, heading towards the kitchen area. \"Do we have any weapons in this van?\" she asked aloud, rummaging through the drawers for something. That got everyone's attention. \"Why?\" Holden stood up and began to walk over to her- to stop her or help her, she didn't know. She didn't care. Her hands paused as they finally landed on a rather large steak knife and she didn't hesitate to pull it out. \"That old man had to have been a part of the ritual. He's one of the transgressions we passed, he has to have been.\" She turned to face them, the knife held firmly in hand. \"He's the only chance we have for answers and I'm going to get them no matter what. I need to know what's going on. I have to know.\" Marty was the only one who seemed to be completely in agreement with her, though the others were varying. Regardless, Curt still pulled over when they reached the gas station. Jules stood up before Dana could get near the door, \"Wait a minute- what ritual? What the hell happened back there at the cabin, Dana?\" Dana paused near the doorway, hesitating for just a moment, \"I can't explain it all right now, Jules, but you have to trust me, okay?\" Her friend wavered, but ultimately nodded in acceptance. Dana opened the door. \"Bring your bong, Marty,\" she tossed over her shoulder before she stepped out of the van. She didn't go charging in full blast like she thought she would. Instead she treaded lightly, softly calling out, \"Hello? Anybody there?\" No one answered her. She could hear the others get out behind her. She slowly made her way closer to the building. \"We're looking to buy some gas?\" she tried. She wondered if he was hiding, or if maybe the cult had disposed of him or something. But nothing moved and nothing replied. She grew even more frustrated. She knew he had to be here. He had to be . She needed answers. She readjusted the knife in her hands to where the blade ran parallel with her arm, readying herself for anything. \"Where are you, you old fuck ?!\" she snapped, her voice rising along with her desperation. \"I know you're here, and I'm not leaving until I get some answers!\" She was at the entrance to the main building by then and that was when she heard the click of the shotgun. She immediately began to backtrack but refused to move too far away. She heard a few intakes of breath behind her and could feel them surrounding her for backup. A hand touched the back of her wrist and she knew it was Marty trying to get her to back up a little more. But she couldn't. The anger that had filled her all last night when going down the elevator returned with a vengeance, and she refused to let it go. The shot gun emerged first from the doorway before the man stepped out. He looked the same as he did yesterday, but the wild and off look in his eyes was more prominent. He leveled the gun at her, but she didn't flinch. She didn't allow herself to, he didn't deserve her fear. The hand at her wrist was more insistent, but she nudged it away gently. \"You better get the hell off my property before my trigger finger starts getting' itchy,\" he growled at her. His beady bloodshot eyes traveled over her to the rest of her friends. She squeezed the knife tighter. \"Why?\" she challenged. \"Are you afraid of what we'll do to you now that we know you don't have those evil gods to back you up?\" She took a defiant step forward. He spit on the ground at her feet. \"It don't matter if they didn't show up this time. The Ancient Ones are always watching and you'd do right to show them some respect.\" Dana heard Marty snort behind her, and felt relieved that he was still so expressive. She'd been worried that he'd never shake out of that comatose state; this gave her some hope that he'd be fine. However, she agreed with his sentiment. \"Why would I give them my respect when they killed my friends and tried to kill me? Why should I get off your property and not rip your face off after you led us to that slaughter?\" she snarled. \"They needed a sacrifice and I gave it to them. If I hadn't, they would have been displeased. I will not apologize for doing my duty,\" he steadied the gun even more. \"Anything to justify murdering kids, huh?\" Marty scoffed. His voice caused the man to look over at him, and that was when Dana moved. It was idiotic, she knew. She had no experience with maneuvering like this, or immobilizing a threat in this manner. She flew blindly and instinctually, her hands reaching out to grab the rifle and rip it away from the man's hands, tossing it to the ground behind her. She used her weight distribution to throw him off balance, pushing him back against the side of the building. The knife she still held found its way to his throat and she kept it there securely, the blade just barely brushing his skin, the threat clear. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed Curt scramble to pick up the rifle. She tightened her hold on the man and the handle of the knife. \"First things first,\" she began, \"What's your name and what is your job?\" He merely curled his lip at her. \"Curt,\" she called softly. The telltale click of a rifle being cocked forced the man to rethink his options. \"Mordecai,\" he spat. \"You can call me Mordecai. And my job is to be the Harbinger, to set up the first transgression for sinners like you .\" He made a move to throw her off, but Holden was right there, restraining Mordecai's left shoulder and wrist tightly against the building. From the pinched look on the old man's face, Dana bet Holden was squeezing and twisting his arm as far as he could. Curt stepping up on the other side to shove the end of the rifle in Mordecai's face helped keep him docile as well. She readjusted her hand on the knife and continued her interrogation. \"What happened? Why is the world still…okay? Why are there no giant evil gods running amuck?\" He didn't answer until Holden violently twisted his arm. He screamed in agony and she repeated, \" What. Happened? \" \"I don't know!\" He barked. \"The gods were supposed to have risen if the Fool hadn't died before sunrise. By all accounts they were supposed to have razed Earth to the ground by now.\" \"Then why haven't they?\" she yelled, the knife pressing a little more sharply into the skin at his throat. \"I don't know!\" he tried lifting his chin to relieve the pressure from his neck, but she merely followed him until he couldn't move his head anymore. She paused then, watching him try to catch his breath as Holden continued to keep his arm in a painful position. She could tell that he was telling the truth; he didn't understand what was going on anymore than the rest of them about why the Ancient Ones didn't rise. However… \"Is that organization still running?\" she asked. He kept his mouth shut. This time Holden bent a finger back. In between his howls of pain he managed to answer \"I don't know!\" \"How do you not know? You work for them! I'm sure you have some form of communication with them- what is it?!\" \"I'm not- will you stop that?! \" he screamed at Holden, but Holden didn't move from his post. Mordecai dropped his head back in exhaustion, exhaling loudly. \"I have a number I call if I need to get in touch with them. They usually never call me, but if they do it's always on that ole' payphone over yonder.\" He motioned with his head to where a dirty old telephone was hooked up to the side of the shack next door on their right. She hadn't even noticed it before, it blended with every other piece of trash at the station. \"What's the number?\" He leveled his gaze at her and Dana held it. \"What's the number?\" she repeated firmly. He chewed on something that she guessed wasn't gum before finally rattling of the numbers. \"Jules?\" Dana questioned over her shoulder. Her friend nodded before jogging over to the decaying phone, jabbing in the correct number and waiting. It was a long couple of seconds. The only sound was the wind blowing through the trees nearby and Mordecai's heavy breathing. She could hear Marty behind her, stepping from one foot to the other nervously. Jules finally broke the silence, \"No one is answering. It says the number has been disbanded.\" She put the phone back down and joined them again. \"Either they are actually gone or he's tipped them off about us.\" \"I haven't said nothin' !\" he spat. \"None of this would have happened if you had just followed the procedure like you were supposed to. I warned them to keep an eye on you two, especially the Fool ,\" he snarled in Marty's direction and Dana tensed in defense. \"But they didn't listen to me and now look at what's happened. Everything's gone to Hell in a hand basket!\" \"Because the alternative would have been so much better?\" Dana scoffed. \"Killing children or setting evil gods free. Obviously those are the better choices than everyone living and the gods leaving, huh?\" \"We've protected this planet for thousands of years off the blood of sacrifices. We've never had an error like this.\" \"Have you ever even seen these so called 'Ancient Ones'? How did you know for sure they'd rise anyway? Or have you been executing thousands of children based on an assumption ?\" she snarled, her hand shaking as her anger continued to build, her voice rising. \"I know my place and my role and I will not apologize for it,\" he stated. His arm was still twisted in an unnatural way, but he didn't look like he was in pain anymore except for the sweat that built on his forehead. \"No, you'll just be left with the fact that you're just a murderer with no justification. The blood of the children that came before us are on your hands and the cult you're a part of. Your excuses mean nothing anymore and you'll have to live with that now.\" She wanted her words to cut. She wanted them to slice through and cause him to feel some sort of regret or remorse. She wanted to be ruthless. But he smiled. A slow widening of his lips, showing off his blackened mismatched teeth and blood from where he'd bit his tongue. It unsettled her how calm he was. And she wasn't the only one. Holden's hands tightened their hold and Curt lifted the rifle more firmly against him. \"I may have their blood on my hands, but you will always have the blood of your friends' on yours. The memory of being the one to call upon the horror that killed them. The memory of being the last survivor as you watched them being picked off one by one.\" His voice was soft and lilting, something she didn't expect him to be capable of. It took her off guard and she found that she couldn't speak as he continued his attack, his horrible breath hitting her in the face. \"How did it feel? Knowing it was your fault that your friends had met their grisly end? The sacrifices that I've sent on their way are just a blur now, there's so many. But you…you will always carry the memories. You will always see the deaths and remember. That is your survivor's guilt. That is your burden to carry and it will haunt you more than it will ever bother me.\" She didn't know what to say. What made it even worse was that he was probably right. No, he was right. She could still see Matthew tossing Jules's head in her mind's eye, feel the weight of it as she caught it. When she looked at Holden she could see the scythe and the blood splatter. She could still hear the roar of the engine and the crash when Curt hit the barrier. She could still smell the blood and burnt air as she and Marty waited for the end. She could still remember the look in Marty's eyes as she pointed a gun at him. At that moment she felt like she'd always remember, that she'd never escape that cabin and that he was right and she wanted nothing more than to push the knife in and not let up. She wanted to cry and scream and buckle to the ground. Instead she kept a calm expression. She showed nothing of the turmoil that was churning inside her and kept a steady hand on the knife. \"That may be, but that doesn't change the fact that I survived- that we survived. Your sacrifice didn't work, your faith is null and void, your Ancient Ones abandoned you.\" He went to speak but she cut him off, \" Now , since you put us through hell, I think we deserve a full tank of gas, on the house. Don't you think so?\" He clenched his jaw in agitation but didn't disagree. \"Curt? Why don't you and Holden escort him over to the gas pump? Make sure he does what he's supposed to.\" \"Will do.\" Holden nodded and she slowly moved the knife back, watching as the boys led Mordecai over to fill up the Rambler. Curt never wavered with his rifle, which he pointed directly at the nape of Mordecai's neck, and Holden kept a firm hand on his shoulder. Mordecai didn't look like he'd try anything anyway; he knew he was outnumbered. Jules followed them to keep an eye on things. It was only when they went around the gas pump and Mordecai was out of her sight that she finally allowed herself to breathe, letting her shoulders slump forward and her hair cover her face as tears pricked her eyes. 'He was right' was what kept running through her mind over and over. She rubbed her eyes viciously, not willing to break down at this fucking gas station of all places. A hand on her shoulder caused her to jerk, swiftly turning to see Marty looking at her with concern. \"Dana-\" \"I'm fine.\" \"No, you aren't. And if you were I'd actually be doubly worried,\" he gave her a small smile, but she knew he was serious. She let out a sigh, knowing he wouldn't take her bullshit; there'd be no point in even trying. So she decided to be honest. \"He's right, you know,\" she said softly. Marty shook his head, \"No he isn't, Dana-\" \"Yes, he is, Marty,\" she said forcefully. \"I can't forget what happened. Every time I close my eyes I still see them; I see all of our friends dying and all those monsters. I still see them and I will always remember that it was my fault.\" He gripped her upper arms and came closer, \"But it wasn't your fault, Dana!\" Her hands instinctively found themselves at his chest- trying to pull him closer or push him away, she wasn't sure. \"How can you say that? After I read the diary?\" Her fingers curled into the fabric of his shirt, \"After I almost shot you?\" She could feel a lump building at the back of her throat and swallowed, pushing it back down. Marty's eyes softened and she couldn't handle that right now. How could he still even look at her? She had pointed a gun at him, ready to take his life just like those people , and he still gazed at her with this…this affection! She didn't deserve it, not any of his kindness. She couldn't even look him in the eye, choosing instead to stare fixedly at the neck of his shirt. However, he wouldn't let her avoid him, craning his neck to force her to look at him, his left hand reaching up to catch her cheek. \"Hey-hey, I don't blame you for any of that. None of us do. It didn't matter what had been chosen, we were going to be attacked regardless. It could have been worse , remember?\" his thumb brushed along her cheekbone. \"And that last thing? I think we evened that out when I let the werewolf attack you, remember?\" he gave her a shaky grin and she felt something inside her relax a little. \"After that, neither of us can really point fingers, can we? Besides, that type of stuff only brings people closer together.\" She couldn't help but roll her eyes at that and his grin strengthened. \"I mean, you know, what's a little attempted murder and werewolf attacks between friends anyway- I mean, really now.\" She tried to suppress it but he saw it anyway. He ducked his head to get a better look, \"Ah! Is that a smile I see?\" Hiding her tiny grin behind a curtain of hair, she playfully thumped him on the chest. Before she could reply, however, Jules was already calling them over, saying that the tank was full and that it was time to go. Marty glanced back at Dana in time to see any evidence of her smile slowly drain away. The hand that still rested on her shoulder squeezed gently. \"Dana-\" \"We should go,\" she interrupted. She tried to move past him, but his grip on her tightened and he pulled her back slightly. \"Hey…,\" he whispered softly, \"It's gonna be alright.\" Her palms slid up his arms to rest on the hands that held her in place. \"We'll see.\" She lightly pressed against his skin before letting him go. Making eye contact, she gave him a small smile, letting him see that she appreciated him being there and then stepped back. \"Come on,\" she nodded in the direction of the Rambler, reaching out to tug on his sleeve. \"Time to get back to society.\" \"You know, I actually kinda miss that ole' binding society,\" he reflected aloud. Having her back to him she didn't see him smile when she giggled in response. \"Yea, me too.\" Dana was almost in the van, had her foot on the first step, when Mordecai decided to leave some parting words. \"Good luck with those memories, ya hear?\" he turned and spit off to the side, a satisfied smirk showing off his crooked teeth. Dana's hand clenched the doorjamb as she reined in her anger. Keeping a composed exterior she turned slowly back to him, her eyes cool and deadly. Her lip curled and without a word she leaned over and spat at his feet. Then she spun on her heel and walked calmly into the vehicle. As she flopped back into her seat she could still hear Marty say, \"I still believe that railroad will get here one day, you just gotta keep the faith!\" before he bounded up the stairs too. He sat opposite of her at the table once again, next to Holden who was at the window seat. As the van started up and pulled out onto the road, Marty grinned cheerfully over at her and she couldn't help but laugh and shake her head in amusement. Unfortunately, it didn't quiet the small voice of fear and anxiety that was growing louder as the prospect of reaching normal life came closer and closer. She felt like a ticking time bomb and she worried what would happen when they finally made it back home. She wondered when she'd eventually destroy everything, because at this point it was bound to happen sooner than later. -x- So I wanted to start a CITW fic and here it is.

But a cute one, not one of the ugly lumpy ones with big sharp teeth and flippers for hands.\" She shoved a short, strapless dress into Dana's arms. \"Here, wear this. You are going to look stunning! Do you want to borrow my new earrings- the emerald teardrop ones? I know I saw you admiring them- and you'd look amazing, Dana. Completely, totally, amazing. Oh- andohmigoshI just had the best best best idea- we should wear cat ears!\" The theater department had set up a haunted house in a building scheduled for remodeling, and they were letting people in one or two at a time. \"Come one, come all, and see…the abandoned carnival…of DEATH…and DESTRUCTION!\"shouted a student dressed as a ringmaster. A drawn-on mustache completed his costume. \"Are you scared?\" Jules whispered. Dana, trying to adjust her dress so that it wouldn't show too much of her bra, just made a noncommittal noise. Haunted houses had never felt real to her- even in third grade, she knew the that fearsome clown was just Ashley's dad wearing a mask from the dollar store. \"Right this way, ladies,\" the 'ringmaster' said, ushering them in. Inside, everything was dark. Dana blinked, trying to make her eyes adjust to the low light. Suddenly, a deformed creature with a minotaur head and a tumor-covered torso lunged at Jules. She screamed, terrified. Acting purely on instinct, Dana lunged forward, drove a knee into the creature's crotch, hauled it up, bopped it on the nose- \"Dana, no!\" Jules caught both of Dana's arms and pinned them behind her back. \"Seriously, what the fuck.\" \"You are so lucky I don't have a penis,\" the creature groaned. When she removed her mask, Dana saw that she was actually Laura, a petite theater student. No wonder Dana had been able to overpower the creature so easily. \"I think you gave me a concussion, though… whatever, just-\" she waved vaguely- \"keep going. I'll, like, go get an ice pack.\" Jules was appropriately frightened, jumping and gasping at all the right places. Every performer seemed energized by the possibility of spooking someone so radiantly beautiful. But Dana was too adrenalin-buzzy to really be aware of anything outside her own head. She kept replaying the few moments of the fight, thinking about how exciting it had been to just cut loose and trust her body like that. \"Wow,\" Jules said, giggling nervously as they emerged into the bright sunlight. \"I feel so-\" \"-alive!\" Dana finished, twirling across the grass with her arms spread wide. Jules gave her a skeptical look. \"Dana, you almost gave that guy a concussion.\" \"Yes, but-\" For a moment, defending her friend, she'd felt powerful, unstoppable. Like a warrior. Like she could do anything. But Jules, the sweetness-and-light extrovert, didn't understand. \"Never mind,\" she murmured, and looped her arm through her friend's for the long walk back to the dorm. \"It's called the Truel,\" the teacher explained. Clicking her laptop, she projected a drawing of a cartoon cowboy onto the big screen at the front of the classroom. Marty was sitting in the third row, sipping a mango smoothie. He liked Probability. …well, he liked the clip art. \"Imagine a duel between three friends. Mr. White is the worst shot- he hits his target one out of every three times. Mr. Grey is slightly better, hitting his target one out of every two times, and never misses. It is decided that each man will get one shot. Mr. White will shoot first, then , then . Who should shoot at to increase his chances of survival?\" Other students got out notebooks and pencils, punched numbers into their graphing calculators, leaned towards each other to discuss possibilities. But Marty just frowned at his smoothie container, turning it slowly. Why would friends shoot friends? When the teacher asked the students to present their fidings, Marty, who never spoke unless called upon, raised his hand within an instant. The teacher felt quite proud of herself. \"Yes, Marty? If you were Mr. White, would you shoot at or ?\" \"Neither. I'd shoot into the air. It seems to me that any quarrel that has friends shooting at friends is… well, pretty fucked up. If I could remind everyone how ridiculous it is to be, y'know, taking a gun and pointing it at people you've maybe even eaten multiple handburgers with, maybe they'd remember that nothing's worth dying for. I guess what I'm saying is…\" He took a deep breath, trying to figure out what had just spilled out of his mouth. \"Sometimes the best way to win an impossible game is not to play.\" And then everyone was fucking staring at him, so he concentrated on his smoothie until his classmates turned their attention back to the teacher. Dana was a warrior, more powerful than she ever believed she could be. Her small frame concealed the fact that she had the determination to succeed in impossible circumstances. She wore fraying henleys and old rock-concert T-shirts- and she was absolutely effing fearless. Marty's illogic was its own form of logic, one that solved problems by zigzagging around expected rules, then hitting those expected rules with a banana, putting little grass skirts on them, and teaching them how to hula dance to showtunes until they learned valuable lessons about the true meaning of friendship. He was, in fact, an unconventional genius. Neither teen knew that they already had the skills they'd end up needing to survive.

As he inhaled the smoke of his joint, wishing the drug to numb the pain, his attention was drawn to the woman at his side. The light in her eyes was fading; that light that put her above all the rest in his eyes. And that hurt more than the stab wound in his back. Part of him, as the world crumbled around him, wanted to turn away. He didn't want Dana to see him cry. He didn't want to see her die. But this was it. The end of the world. \"Marty.\" Her voice was weak, but somehow she managed to push herself up against the vicious quaking. She angled herself towards him, and Marty automatically dropped the joint to help her. One arm went around her shoulders and the other went to push the blood-soaked hair from her temple. Dana's eyes were wide with terror, and desperation. \"Don't think of me as a complete bastard,\" he started without thinking, \"but I always thought you were kinda foxy.\" To his surprise, she laughed. It was choked and rough from the wounds on her throat. Marty bit back the tears that were threatening to spill. Her hand on his arm was slipping, and her breathing was shallow. But then, against all odds, her arm was like a vice on his and she pulled him down to her lips. Hard . The next thing he knew he was tasting blood and dust and Dana. Beyond the general shock of this woman kissing him, there was the fleeting thought of Wow. You should probably stop underestimating her. It was sad and despairing, but Marty was shaking as he kissed her back as gently as he could. For a blissful moment, he realized that he was happy to die like this. Light flooded the room, and something like wind tugged at their clothes. This is it, Marty thought as the pain washed away. Dana had slid a grimy hand through his hair to keep him from pulling away. But then there was nothing. No, not like death nothing nothing. Like nothing changed. He didn't want to pull away from Dana, even if they did end up in heaven, but curiosity was too much. The first thing he realized was that the blood and bite marks had disappeared from Dana's body. And she was still breathing. The second thing he noticed was that they were not alone. YOUR PURE LOVE HAS BROKEN THE SPELL. THANK YOU, MARTIN MIKALSKI AND DANA POLK. About a dozen giant dazzling gods stood before them, cracked chamber finally ceasing in its shaking. No longer wraithlike and menacing, they were bright and multi-colored. Like angels. Or something. Marty's jaw dropped, his mind not completely processing the fact that he wasn't dead yet. On the contrary, all the dirt and gore from his hands—and clothes—was cleared off. Like magic. \"What?\" WE HAVE SLEPT FOR MILLENIA, HOPING THE DAY WOULD COME WHERE THE SPELL PLACED UPON US WOULD BE BROKEN BY TRUE LOVE'S KISS. AN EVIL WITCH HAD— \"I think we get the gist. You're saying, all of this, everything, the sacrifices—\" Dana choked off, gaping in astonishment. \"—would have ended if I had just laid one on this guy?\" BASICALLY. \"This is so much bullshit.\" BULLSHIT? ONE WOULD THINK YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL, TINY HUMAN. \"After killing our friends?\" Dana shouted. \"Maiming us? Nearly destroying the world? Yeah, I think bullshit is the right word.\" IT WAS JUST A BIT OF FUN, REALLY. OH, FINE, FINE. NO NEED TO GET HUFFY. THE OTHER HUMANS ARE RESTORED; ALIVE AND WELL. WE WILL SEND YOU BACK TO YOUR HOMES AND WE ANCIENTS WILL CONTINUE OUR GUARDIANSHIP OF EARTH. Marty blinked. \"That's it?\" THAT'S IT. \"Oh.\" Roughly five minutes later, they were teleported on the behest of the Ancient Ones back to Dana's townhome. Heart beating rapidly, still unsure if he should believe what had just occurred, Marty scanned the living room they had poofed into. Holden and Curt were sprawled on the couch, fast asleep. Dana moved first, slowly walking over to their friends. \"I wonder if they'll remember anything,\" she whispered. She stared at them as if trying to make sure they were real. Her hand reached out and brushed Curt's shirt. He shifted, huffing, but fell back to sleep. Marty shivered. \"I hope not.\" They checked upstairs, and found Jules (head and all) curled up in the reading chair in Dana's room. A red comforter was tucked under her chin. They quietly backed out of the room, letting her sleep. Marty leaned heavily against the wall of the hallway, grateful that he no longer had to favor his back. Dana did the same. For a few moments they just stood there, soaking in the shock and relief of being back in their normal lives. Out of a nightmare that they created and then fixed. That power was, perhaps, more frightening to Marty than the zombies. Finally his friend broke the silence. \"True love's kiss, huh?\" Dana muttered. \"Who'd'a'thunk?\" he responded, chuckling nervously. \"Fairytales? Evil witches? Monsters?\" She passed a hand through her magically-cleaned hair. \"I need a fucking nap.\" \"Okay. I'll check up on you in an hour, Aurora. In case you need an, uh, alarm clock.\" He wriggled his brow teasingly. \"Don't get smart on me, Marty,\" Dana deadpanned. \"I've had a long day.\" Her warm hand slipped into his and squeezed gently. Marty swallowed at the sweetness in Dana's face. The same face that was screwed tight in determination as she leveled a gun at his head. The same face that was wild in fright and anger as she fought for her life. Relief was there now, and the slightest uncertainty too. \"We're gonna be okay,\" he murmured, squeezing back. \"Yeah,\" Dana sighed. \"Yeah, we are.\" She hesitated at first, but then leaned forward and brushed her lips against the side of his mouth. It was soft and warm, and filled him with life. He felt dizzy, and Marty was pretty sure that the amused look on her face as she pulled away was in response to his goofy grin. \"An hour,\" he stated seriously when he finally got control over his speech once more. Dana rolled her eyes, but the smile remained as she went into her room for her nap. ","Summary":" 0o0o0o0o0 Marty's heart pounded, and every inch of his body ached.

The sunlight always managed to scare away the worst of her fears, and she would wake up to him sleeping behind her, chest rising and falling slowly with his arms still wrapped dutifully around her. Even in sleep it wasn't uncommon for his grip to tighten when she moved to get up, and she would have to gently uncoil his arms to free herself, usually leaving Marty to roll over with a sleepy mumble. She never left the room for long, just to use the bathroom and find something resembling breakfast. She'd come back to bed soon enough, and whichever book she chose to read while she sipped on her coffee would come second to quieting the small fits of restless shifting and incoherant noises that came of his nightmares with a hand on his collar or in his hair to rub gentle circles that seemed to penetrate into the world of sleep. It would only take a handful of these fits to wake him up completely, and he would usually come back into the world of consciousness breathing heavily as his most recent nightmare melted in the sunlight. He would never really relax until his eyes had locked on Dana and he was sure she was alive and unharmed.

After the deaths, after opening monsters of nothing but nightmare on the world, after awakening ancient gods and ending the world came the unsettling quiet that signaled it was really over. It was over, and Marty and Dana were still there, still intact. They'd get up from their place at the bottom of the steps and walk through the empty building and outside; navigate their way back to people, humanity-a town or something, at least. But instead, it was like their karma. where there was once everything, there was now nothing. New York City itself had probably become a ghost town by now. Everyone was gone, all they had was each other. Which was funny, because in the beginning they weren't even friends really. He was always 'Jules' friend Marty' and she was always 'Jules' friend Dana.' She'd been there always, in the background when he had his first joint and hiding behind Him that one time Jules had convinced them to crash a frat party. They'd loved each other from the start, it was just whether or not they were going to admit it. Now, however, admitting it didn't matter so much anymore, there was so much silence that they didn't need words, their emotions existed in the ways they touched, the way he held her body in his and the look she gave him whenever she was about to make a hard decision. And as they passed the now-empty towns and cities, sometimes on car, sometimes on foot, Marty would make sarcastic remarks and Dana would just be grateful that she still had him to watch out for her, to protect her from any creepy gas station workers that came their way. And in this world, that would be a welcome sight. The world had ended, and they had just missed it. \"The whole world Marty...\" She had said, thinking of all the babies and the children and the innocents that would die. The whole world, that meant a lot of people; but apparently, it didn't mean them. ","Summary":" What came after was silence.

Please enjoy My name is Jules Louden, before that night I was just an average college student with a wonderful life ahead of me. I had good marks, paid my own rent, a big caring family, best friends anyone could ever ask for, and I was really proud of myself for that. I had everything planned out so perfectly and thought nothing could ever change that, but after that…incident, things don't seem to matter anymore, life isn't worth living anymore without them. I should be grateful I guess, that there are still people who cares about me, they keep telling me that I'll get well, that everything is going to be okay. They're wrong. If there's anything I know for sure, it is that my life will never be the same again. Because that one fateful night, I've crossed the line from where I can never return. We all did. I guess, what they say is true, you don't know what you have until it's gone. It all began when Curt, my boyfriend for 5 months then, decided to drag me on a small trip to the countryside where he said his cousin just bought a cabin. I refused at first, being a pre-med and the president of the pre-med society at our college really left me little time to rest, or as my boyfriend put it, 'day off.' He claimed I was being too overly competitive and 'crazy' about my grades and internships, he didn't feel he was getting the 'love that he needs.' I wouldn't call building the perfect resume 'crazy,' heck everybody in my class was basically hardwired like that, you can't survive pre-med by fooling around. I admit though that I've always been an overachiever, so he should have known better, he was supposed to be my boyfriend after all. But that guy, with the determination of a hungry lion chasing its prey, kept on pestering me by coming up with silly 'romantic' things to persuade me. Unwilling to take no for an answer, he snuck into the dean's office and asked me, for what was like the billionth time, over the intercom. There had been much laughing, jokes were made and as well as threats of expulsions, but in the end I gave in, but only after I told him that there would be no kinky stuff and that I could invite my best friend, Dana Polk, to the trip. She needed the 'day off' more than anyone in the campus and I'd have felt really awful to just leave my best friend on a trip while she was going through a rough time all by herself. You see, my pal Dana, she was trying to get over an affair she had with a teacher. It was a pretty stupid relationship to have, but knowing her since we were little, she always was that gullible. Days later, Curt managed to convince me to have his new jock friend, goes by the name of Holden McCrea, in the trip. Holden is a nice and down-to-earth guy but I wasn't sure then if Dana would appreciate it, not that he wasn't good looking or hot enough, I just didn't think it was very subtle, with her just barely coping with the post break-up mess and all. In the few occasions that I had the time to watch my boyfriend train, I came to realize that he was good at his game and would make a good receiver. Other than the fact that he was good at football, he turned out to be quite well-informed in the medical field too, having volunteered in his hometown's hospital as a nurse. He admitted that he originally wanted to apply for pre-med at his hometown's college but his family just couldn't afford it, and besides he got accepted to our college on football scholarship. He also confided in me that he didn't think he would 'fit in' after seeing how closely-knit we (Dana, Curt, Marty and me) were to each other, but I told him that I was just happy to have someone in the group that I can talk stuff with, without making that someone sleepy or think that I'm weird, he laughed at that, saying he knew exactly the feeling. All in all, I think he would make a good addition to the 'gang' and of course, a good match for Dana. I just hoped that Dana could get past the whole matchmaking thing and give him a chance. During the trip, I don't know why, maybe it was Marty's joint or something that I had that morning, but I felt so…warm and energetic. It felt like I just drank the same stuff that Curt put in his shake every morning. I couldn't help it when I joined Marty dancing around like crazy to Led Zeppelin's 'Black Dog,' rocking the RV, while Curt tried unsuccessfully to keep it down. My newly dyed hair was blowing around my face wildly as I danced to the music, for once in my life I actually didn't mind it getting messy. Holden broke down into laughter seeing me acting silly, having never seen me acting like that before. Dana however, had known me long enough to get 'acquainted' with my wild-side, so she just shook her head after I bumped my head with Marty's when the RV hit a pothole. I've thought about it, and I'm 100% percent sure Curt did that on purpose. Getting back, that's your concern. I should have caught that, the harbinger, and all the signs. We were just too lost in emotion to recognize it. We assumed him to be nothing but a creepy old redneck, but he must have known something about the cabin and the monster. He must have. As we left the gas station, Holden took over the wheel as Curt moved to the back to soothe me. I was angry, and confused. I tried my best to not break down and cry, but the tears just came out on their own. It was just cruel, what was his reason for calling me that in front of all my friends. He didn't know me. What did I do to deserve it? I kept asking myself that. Before I knew it Curt already had his arms wrapped around me and I began to cry on his shoulder, soiling his shirt in the process. We kept like that for a while, just me and him in the back of the RV, away from anybody else to spare me the shame of having to bawl like a kid in front of them all. But from the absence of Marty's wild rants about the Martians, I guessed, they already knew. An hour later we at last arrived at the cabin. The cabin was dark and brooding, it didn't look like anybody's been living in it for a while and it has certainly seen better days. It was one those cabins that looked small in front but quite spacious inside. But still, not quite what I had in mind. Nevertheless, it was trivial, my boyfriend had put a lot of effort into this trip for all of us, and this was also supposed to be my day off from the hectic university life, which I've got to enjoy with nobody else but my best friends, so I wasn't going to let some rickety cabin bother me. Somehow I felt something was off. It wasn't just the cabin, there was just something about the woods itself that's been bugging me since we got off the RV, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Curt's firm arm pulled me away from my thoughts as he hauled me inside. The cabin turned out to be quite spacious. The 'lounge', which it shared with a modest kitchen took up the entire width of the cabin. A large old fireplace on the left, a cozy couch, a homely rug and several armchairs facing the fireplace, there was also a mounted wolf on the right side of the path that leads to the hallway which stretches far to the back. It was very stereotypical, though I was grateful for the indoor plumbing. The little worry that I'd left further dissipated when Curt told everybody of the nearby lake. I always thought nothing could beat a dip in a lake in a hot summer day. I wasted no time throwing on my swimsuit, a two-piece bikini that I just bought yesterday, it didn't really cover much, which made me wonder why I bought them in the first place. Curt liked it though, I just hoped that it didn't give him any ideas. Dana and Holden, who I was very glad to see getting along pretty well, didn't waste any time as they thundered down the pier and cannonballed into the water. I knew better though, judging from the temperature, it'd be a little while for the water to warm up. I thought I'd just find a spot to lay out the towel and soak up the rays a little bit, giving Dana some 'alone time' with Holden. I smirked when I saw the realization in Dana's pleading eyes. But of course, Curt had to be such an idiot and decided to do yet another one of his mindless acts as he threw me into the water. After several angry splashes directed at Curt and telling him he just missed the chance at oiling up my body, I realized that there was one of us missing, Marty! I turned my head and there he was standing gleefully on the pier, him and his joint, apparently he enjoyed witnessing his friends making a fool out of themselves. He looked so stoned all the time then, I didn't even remember the last time I seen him 'sober'. I've always told him he could get addicted by it but by that point it looked like he already did. Anyhow, that was not an excuse to not 'suffer' the cold water with the rest of us. I didn't know how, but an idea came into my mind and I whispered it to Curt, he was so excited he forgot to swim as his body began to sink in the water. He then spread it to Holden and Dana. So the objective was to throw Marty into the water, how, was something that even I until now can't even believe my mind to be capable of generating such ideas. Marty and I used to be sweethearts in high school. I knew the feeling was still there no matter how stoned he was. He's a boy after all. I called him to the side of the pier, and then I pulled myself up along the edge of the pier giving him perfect view of my not-so-covered glistening cleavage. \"Come on Marty, swim with us, you're missing out on the fun,\" I said in my most innocent voice. He mumbled something, I saw his eyes wandering down as I smiled slyly. \"See anything you like?\" I teased as I edged closer to the nervous guy. \"Jules…\" he was totally mesmerized by the show. \"NOW!\" I shouted. Marty looked over his shoulder and knowing what was coming, took one last big drag of his joint and down he went. Who says only little kids could play games in the water? We had fun playing several games that day, we had underwater competitions which Marty had surprisingly won. I nearly had it and he told me later that he was this close to coming up for air himself, I didn't know if that was supposed to make me feel better or not, at the fact that I'd just lost to a stoner. We then had an Olympic-style race, Curt aced this one with Holden close behind. Though I didn't believe their fancy butterfly stroke was necessary, they just did it for the show knowing that the rest of us couldn't do it, front crawl was proven scientifically to be the best actually. So I believe, it was just due to their brute force actually. I like to think of it that way. We also had a 'chicken fight' where we, the girls, sat on the shoulders of the guys and tried to knock each other out. I didn't know how that turned into a wrestling match between the boys. I also had Dana demonstrate her synchronized swimming skill. She began taking synchronized swimming classes during high school, which I also attended, and has gone and won several competitions. I just told her that it'd be good to let Holden know about it now that he was here and she reluctantly agreed, but she balked when I likened the idea to animal's mating call. Just by seeing Holden's awed face I'd say it was pretty successful. Well, who'd have guessed the shy and bookish Dana Polk had such skill? The time flew by and soon the sun was already behind the tree-lined horizon. We dried up and left, feeling really exhausted after all the splashing, jumping, and racing. We had a grill party on the terrace at the back later on. Fresh meat, corn, marinated mushrooms, shredded cheese, onions, potatoes, zucchini, sausages and shrimps all thrown into the grill. It was tended and cooked by Curt himself, the self-proclaimed 'master grill,' and from the wonderful smell he might really have a gift for the grill. Curt came with the sizzling dishes later, the ones he was very proud to say to be 'guarded family secret,' it was well worth the wait. The warmth of the summer, good company, delicious food, cold beers and a good view to the sunset, it couldn't get any better than that. It really was one of the most wonderful moments I've ever had, but unknown to me at that time, it'd also be one of the last. With the feast finished, everybody settled in the main room. We put on some music and had a couple of drinks from the keg before Marty came up with 'truth or dare' and he dared me first! I suspected then that this was how he was going to get his payback from being thrown into the water earlier, and no matter what I chose, he'd get his payback. \"I dare you, to make out with that moose over there!\" he pointed enthusiastically to the mounted wolf head across the room. I rolled my eyes, he wouldn't be able to notice a difference even if the thing howled at him. But if he wanted to see me giving french, I'd say let him see it. That way he'd see what he's been missing. I didn't know what came over me that night, I'd never dream in a million years of making out with a wolf, mounted or not. I would have preferred Dana over that beast, not that I'm into women, at least Dana doesn't have those sharp pointy teeth and is easier to the eyes. I closed my eyes and I neared the tip of my lips to the wolf's until I felt it. I slowly sucked on it like it was Curt's. My fingers drifted through the rugged fur of the beast as I traced the outline of its teeth with the length of my tongue. I continued on with my nose brushed against the beast's. The kiss started out soft, but it started to get harder, it was quickly filled with heat and wanting. My tongue danced between the lengths of the teeth, licking it off so passionately as if it was a proper lover. The sourness of whatever coated the thing didn't even bother me. It felt so weird and yet so wonderful on my tongue. Finally, I slowly parted and 'thanked' the beast with my head still spinning from the lurid fragrance of it. But I was proud nonetheless, it was just one of those experience that you won't ever forget. Marty looked like he couldn't believe I just did it before he started to clap his hands in astonishment followed by everybody. The game continued and I was about to dare Dana to make out with Holden when a huge bang shook everyone from their seats. I looked past the couch and saw that it was the cellar door. It'd been mysteriously opened. I instantly got an idea. \"Dana,\" I called her, she turned her head, fright in her eyes. \"I dare you.\" I grinned as she whimpered, knowing full well what it was. Less than a minute into her dare, the sound of her deafening shriek tore through the place. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at that. I honestly didn't know what the fuss was about, she ought to be grateful that she'd only need to stay down there for thirty minutes to finish her dare considering the alternative. What was the worst thing that a cellar could have? Spiders, maybe, surprisingly enough I'd never seen one today. We went down the stairs and found her facing a faded portrait of a young girl, it looked old and out of place down there. I was wondering what it was doing in an abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods and whether Curt's cousin had anything to do with it, when Marty lit the lantern which illuminated the barely-lit cellar. We looked around and suddenly found ourselves surrounded by weird antiques. Macabre was the perfect word for it. There were dolls, not the cute ones either, it looked like it came out from the creepy doll island I happened to visit in a trip to Mexico. Then there were porcelain masks, toys, more old portraits and some carnival props, heck there was even a fortune telling machine down there. I then looked to the side and spotted something that caught my eyes. It was the prettiest pendant ever, the jewel that rested on the chest of the mannequin glimmered at me as if it was inviting me to come and try her. I was so taken by it, I didn't realize I'd knocked over a tape recorder and I jumped when it began to play on its own. It started with a grainy voice of a man. \"Tuesday, June 25th 1982. These past days have been a nightmare for all of us, to think that it has only been three days…time sure is going slowly down here.\" \"Blair said that this alien, this…thing, it absorbs and imitates other beings and it imitates them perfectly. I'd have said it was his delusion talking if I hadn't seen it myself…What it did to Bennings…I still can't get the image out of my head, given a little more time it'd have imitated him perfectly.\" The man paused. By that time, everybody was already gathered around the recorder on the ground. \"We let that dog-thing roam freely around our outpost the day it got here, if that thing was half as smart as Blair believed it was, then it couldn't just be Bennings. The blood sabotage proved my worst fear that some of them, if not all, have already been…imitated.\" \"I'm going to hide this tape when I'm finished. If none of us make it, at least there'll be some kind of record. The storm's been hitting us hard now for... 48 hours…We still have nothing to go on…\" \"One other thing, I think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over and assumes your identity. Windows found some shredded longjohns but the nametag was missing…They could be anybody's. Nobody... nobody trusts anybody now, and we're all very tired... there's nothing more I can do, just wait... R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot, US outpost #31. \"There was nothing but the sound of the howling of the wind in the recording, whoever it was, must have been recording it outdoor, then it continued, \"June 26th. It's only me and Childs now, I don't know where Nauls and Garry are but I assumed the worst. I was forced to burn the outpost down to prevent those…things from spreading…my only hope is that it's frozen for good.\" \"I-I can no longer feel anything, I feel s-so cold, i-it's not going to be long now….Childs, I think he's already g-gone, if you find this tape, please b-burn our bodies, it's the only w-way to make sure that they stay dead… R.J. MacReady, helicopter pilot, US outpost #31. Out.\" The button clicked back and that was the end of it. There were silence for a moment as everybody tried to digest what we had just listened. We looked silently at each other. \"That sounds genuine.\" Curt commented. \"Those days before any action movies, people listen to these kind of things for entertainment all the time man. Even this one time in the 40s, people actually believed that the Martians were invading the earth because it was tuned on the radio.\" Marty said. \"The tape recorder wasn't invented until the 60s.\" Holden stated in an as-a-matter-of-factly voice. \"Actually, the Soviet Russians…\" Marty began. \"Let's just get out of here,\" Dana suggested and everybody gratefully nodded in agreement. I looked around the place for the last time, and as I climbed up, I wondered if we'd just made a huge mistake by going down there in the first place.

Hoy vi Cabin in the Woods con unos amigos. Al principio me desconcertó bastante. No solo la trama y no entender porque lo mandaban ahí, si no la parte romántica. No puedo evitar pensar en eso cuando veo una película, por más de que no sea de romance. No me gustan muchos las películas todas \"romanticosas\" me gusta el amor en un segundo plano. Creo que es perfecto. Y sinceramente al principio pensé que Dana terminaría con Curt, luego con Holden, pero cuando llegué al final y vi que Marty la abrazaba de esa manera, fue tan: \"¡Awwww, son el uno para el otro!\" Espero que les guste. PD: Escuchen \" I Just Can't Live A Lie \" porque me encanta como queda con el fic. Disclaimer: Cabin in the Woods no es mío. (Si lo fuera, Marty y Dana hubieran sobrevivido y se hubieran besado... y todo eso...) Lo Único Que Tenían: Iban en el ascensor. Ese ascensor. El que les mostraba todos los horrores por los que podrían morir. Ellos miraron a todos lados asustados. No sabían que mirar, que pensar, que… hacer. Marty pasó su brazo por el hombro de Dana. Tratando de protegerla de algún modo. Ella se aferró a él con fuerza. Estaba aterrada. Si seguían luchando era porque esperaban vivir. Y en esa vida lo único que tendrían sería el uno al otro. - Sabes, Dana. – Dijo tembloroso Marty. – Cuando salí por un corto tiempo con Jules, me di cuenta de que ella no era mi tipo. – Rió. – Creo que te cuento esto porque en algún momento tenía que contárselo a alguien. - Lo dices como si nunca más tuvieras la oportunidad de contárselo a nadie. Como si no… estuvieras para hacerlo. - Es lo más probable. – Contestó con franqueza. - No digas eso… vamos a lograrlo, ¿Verdad? – Marty se encogió de hombros. - No lo se. Solo se que quiero estar aquí contigo para siempre. – Sonrió calidamente. Ella se dio la vuelta para mirarlo de frente. - ¿Qué dices? – Preguntó sonriendo de lado. Su mirada era tranquila. Como si el terror hubiese desaparecido por un instante. El también sonrió. - Nada. – Contestó solamente. Una criatura se acercó a la ventana. Pero ellos no le prestaron mucha atención. – Lo siento. - ¿Por qué? – Preguntó ella frunciendo el seño. - Por todo. – Respondió apretando los labios. – No quería esto. - Nadie lo quería. – Contestó ella abrazándolo. – Estoy segura de que todo hubiera sido diferente si no hubiera pasado esto. - Todo sería distinto. De no haber pasado esto quizás yo… - Empezó pero se quedó sin terminar la frase. - ¿Quizás tu? – Lo animó a continuar Dana - Quizás yo me hubiera animado a decir muchas cosas. - ¿Cómo cuales? Puedes decirlas ahora y será como si las hubieras dicho. No es demasiado tarde. - No. – Contestó pensando. – No lo es. – Sonrió. - ¿De que te sonríes? – Preguntó en una risita. - De que tienes razón. No es demasiado tarde para hacer algo que siempre quise hacer. - ¿Y que querías hacer? – Preguntó mirándolo profundamente a los ojos. - De hecho… - Empezó acercándose a ella. Dana no lo previó. No supuso que Marty la iba a besar. Pero cuando lo hizo, ella se permitió por un momento pensar que todavía estaban en su casa, cuando todos iban a ver una película de terror, como la que estaban viviendo ahora. Ellos se quedaban hasta tarde. Y él era el último en irse siempre. Marty decía que era porque quería hacerle compañía. Y cuando iban a la casa de otros, él siempre la acompañaba a su casa. Ni siquiera lo hacía Holden, su supuesto pretendiente. Y eso nunca le hizo pensar que Marty pudiera estar enamorado de ella. Marty la besaba con calidez y dulzura. Pero también con miedo. Mucho miedo. Dana podía sentirlo, porque ella misma estaba aterrada. - ¿Eso siempre quisiste hacer? – Preguntó con los ojos brillantes al separarse de él. - En algún momento tenía que hacerlo. – Contestó mirando a un lado. Dana lo tomó de la mano. Ahora sabían. Ahora entendían. Si morían o vivían… lo harían juntos. Porque eso, es lo único que tenían. ","Summary":" ¡Hola! Hoy vi Cabin in the Woods con unos amigos. Al principio me desconcertó bastante. No solo la "},{"Movie":"Cabin in the Woods","Title":"Waiting for Sunrise","Author":"Mint Pearl Voice","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8725166","Passage":"[Chapter 1] At some point during the night, Dana goes back to her room to change into a camisole and pajama shorts (it's nice to be able to get away with going braless.) But she's so tired that when she sits on her bed for a moment, she ends up just falling asleep. And then- Dana jolts awake, images and sensations flowing away from her mind like water roaring down a drain. Blood on her face, her hair, only most of it hers- a decapitated head bouncing, the shock of cold water, the snarl of pointed teeth, a one-armed little girl dragging an axe- and Jules, Curt, Holden- Ohshit. Dana's breaths come in little gasps. She yanks the blankets away and casts frantically around for a weapon. Lamp. Lamp good. Lamp good yes. The lamp has a reassuring heft. Her entire body taut, Dana creeps toward the door, alert to even the slightest ambient noises. A twig snaps outside her window. Fuck this subtlety shit, Dana thinks, and runs. So it's like 2 AM, maybe three, and the fire is starting to flicker down a bit, as if someone's hit the dimmer switch, but the closet holds wool and flannel blankets aplenty, and Curt and Holden finally got the space heater working, so the whole cabin has this nice, toasty glow to it. Marty's telling some inane story about how a guy once cut him off on the highway while he was listening to a Kurt Vonnegut audiobook. He's getting really into it, gesturing more animatedly by the second- like, he's really pissed off about this, you know? And he just had this epiphany about how Vonnegut was right, man- That's when Dana runs in- barefoot and on the verge of sobbing, her hair in disheveled tangles, gripping a lamp like she's about to shank somebody with it. Marty stops mid-word. Her friends- no, her family. They're all still here, still alive, and how is that even possible? Jules un-nestles herself from Curt. \"Dana, sweetie, you okay?\" Jules. Amazing Jules, Jules who can match her shoes to her earrings, Jules who is made of metaphorical sunshine and poodle fluff and who makes precalculus look so fucking easy. When Dana got The Email from her teacher, she was too stunned to do anything but cry. She skipped all her classes that day and just hid under her duvet doodling geometric figures and rain clouds. Marty left her the most comforting voicemail ever, and that made her smile a bit before the tears prickled her eyes again. But Jules came to her dorm room with two bottles of bright pink nailpolish and a Styrofoam container of leftover cafeteria lagnasa, lured Dana out of her funk with ordinary gossip and an offer of hair-braiding. Dana has never met anyone so genuinely loveable as Jules. Did she even thank her for the lagnasa? Dana drops the lamp and, heedless of its shattering, propels herself into Jules's arms. She presses her nose against Jules's collarbone and breathes flowery Victoria's Secret perfume. \"Jules,\" she says, her voice muffled and unsteady, and wraps her arms around the other girl. \"I just. Love you so much. Okay? Friend love. You're the best friend anyone could ever ask for and please, please be careful-\" Curt makes a concerned sound and pats Dana on the back. Curt. Holy shit, Curt. Why is she not hugging Curt? Dana scrambles over Jules's lap and scooches between the couple to curl up against Curt. She has not appreciated Curt enough. So brave, so resolute- she remembers a dim image of the way he was willing to risk his life for them, the way his courage ended up not mattering in a way that, to an outside observer, would have been hilariously fucking ironic. Curt is amazing at recommending books. He knows about works of obscure literary fiction translated into English that have twenty viewpoint characters and six timelines, two of which run backwards, and he'll coax Dana into reading it and she'll protest about things like business and homework, but in the end she'll acquiesce and slip the heavy hardcover into her backpack, and in the end it'll be the best thing ever and she can think of nothing else. Also, he makes Jules ridiculously happy. \"Do you need anything?\" Holden asks. Holden. In her dream, they were almost lovers. Dana doesn't know him as well as she knows Curt and Jules, but she'd like to. Not necessarily in a \"kissing and horizontal tango\" way, but she knows Holden is someone she can rely on. Reassuring and logical in a crisis, never willing to give up, sweet and kind and now that she has him in her life, she's going to take advantage of the friendship opportuntity. Dana stumbles from one couch to another to rest her head on Holden's shoulder. He strokes her hair- a little awkwardly, but it still feels nice. \"Hey, Dana, did my secret stash tell you to smoke it? We've gone over what happens when you get stoned- you know, mucho with the shaking and the vomiting and the general not-good things. Leave the drugs to the professionals.\" Marty, standing up and leaning against the couch, unharmed and unbloodied. It was just them at the end, she remembers, leaning against each other and sharing a final joint and waiting for the apocalypse. He'd given her space to vent her rage against the glass-caged nightmares, then held her comfortingly when her fury dissolved into sorrow. And he'd saved her life. With someone else to worry about, she'd stayed angry, stayed fighting. They'd snapped their strings and given the finger to the puppeteers. Marty meant so, so much to her. Dana wriggles from Holden's embrace and collapses against Marty, wrapping her arms around him. He hugs her back just as tightly. \"I wouldn't have shot you,\" she mumbles, even though she doesn't know why she's saying it. It's just really important that he understands her. \"I wouldn't have, okay? I promise I wouldn't have.\" \"You might have,\" Marty says, his voice shaking a little. \"I wouldn't have blamed you.\" They cling fiercely to each other. A long moment later, he lifts his head, strokes her cheek with a hand that she's surprised doesn't have blood on it. \"You gonna be okay, Dana?\" That's where the head- Jules's head- bounced across the cabin. That's where Big Zombie broke through the door. She leans against him. \"I'm not sure.\" No one is entirely sure how to respond to that. \"So,\" Jules says, a little too brightly, \"is anyone interested in playing Truth or Dare? Truth, Dare, or Lecture?\" \"No. Nononono, we can't play that. Wait- does this cabin have a cellar? We have to nail down the door- duct-tape it, anything- we can't go down there-\" Dana crawls across the floor, desperately searching for the opening. I can stop this. Curt wrinkles his nose. \"Dude. Why would a cabin have a cellar?\" \"You're acting really weird, Dana,\" Jules says, all concerned and protective. \"And I'm saying that as your friend.\" She finds the spot where the cellar door was, traces its outline with her fingers- but there's no door. Just floorboards. Only it was so real, so real, the cellar must be here somewhere, it has to be, she has to stop them- what if there are zombies in the woods right now? \"I'm sorry, I just-\" and then she starts crying. Dana acts majorly weird for the rest of the evening, freaking out every time she hears a noise outside, even if it's just an owl hooting. When everyone else starts to trickle off to bed, she takes the sharpest, largest kitchen knife from the drawer. \"I'm going to wait outside,\" she says firmly. \"They'll have to kill me last, so maybe I can buy you guys time.\" Okay, maybe she's acting kind of irrational, but there could be zombies. Everyone exchanges nervous looks. Is it really a good idea to let the girl who's been sobbing for no reason go outside alone with an edged weapon? Seriously, though- danger to herself and others much? \"I'll wait up with her,\" Marty says quietly, and the other three relax. Dana is alert, every muscle ready for battle; Marty sits back, smoking a joint. Finally he says, \"I had the dream too, Dana.\" She looks like a startled fawn. \"Really?\" \"If it's the dream you're talking about, the one with the killing and the dying and the monsters… really.\" Dana chews on her bottom lip. Then: \"The tooth-faced ballerina?\" \"Yep.\" \"The Angry Bad-Touch Tree?\" \"Wish I hadn't seen it, but… again, yep.\" She's silent for a long moment. \"So what do you think it means?\" \"I don't know. It's just a dream. Why does it have to mean something?\" Which is Marty for \"I'm not ready to talk about it yet.\" Dana respects that. They scan the forest in silence. Suddenly- \"Tell me what's going to happen tomorrow. Tell me there's going to be a tomorrow.\" Marty looks uncharacteristically solemn and in need of reassurance. The forest seems dark and menacing, and Dana wonders if they're just living in the calm before the apocalypse. The warmth from inside radiates against their backs; inside, their friends sleep peacefully, untroubled by horrifying visions. And she's not alone. \"We'll sleep till noon,\" Dana begins, a little unsteadily. She tries not to look at the trees or think about what might emerge from them. \"And then Curt will wow us all with his mastery of the pancake.\" Marty cracks a small smile. The knowledge that her words are working emboldens Dana. She feels stronger, braver, as if a light within her is dispelling the darkness. \"We'll go kayaking or mountain-biking or maybe just swimming, and we'll stay out till the sun sets. We'll collect twigs and make a fire in the fireplace. We'll roast marshmallows and get our hands sticky and play Would You Rather… and we'll try to ignore the dulcet tones of Jules and Curt having wild monkey sex.\" Marty snorts with barely repressed laughter. \"As soon as the sun rises- you'll see. Everything will be normal.\" \"As soon as the sun rises,\" Marty agrees softly. Dana and Marty lean against each other and wait for sunrise. Or the apocalypse. Secretly, they're not sure which.

Pitch black all around you, and a silence that only the wolves can break. No one can hear you, so why do you cry? Come, love, do not fear me. I am here to save you. Who are you? I, I am you. Spinning head, and dizzy, twisted thoughts- where have you taken me? I've have taken us inside of ourselves. Do you understand now? Can you now begin to fathom the pain you've been wading in, my love? Light! but it's so far away from us. I can reach, and stretch, and run and jump...but I do not get any closer. Yet, they keep telling you that you're almost there? Should you give up and lay your weary body down? Maybe you can reach it someday. Maybe...maybe...maybe. I'm slowly waking into the 'real' world again, and it upsets me. If I had the choice, I would stay inside of my dreams for all eternity. A place when nightmares seem more real. Now, why would I like that better than reality? Listen closely to the thunder. \"Reality is the deadly truth, Dreams are a beautiful illusion.\" It's useless trying to fight the steaming, afternoon sun when she burns underneath the lids of your eyes. Where was this blast of light coming from? I shield my eyes with the shadows of my hands, and search for the source. There is an open door and the other end of the dark eternity where a silhouette blocks some of the blinding, heated light. Reality came rushing back through me and the memories hit me like a semi-truck traveling at 70 mph. I was thrown into the back of the car, my head being slammed against the side of the door and busting upon contact. I hadn't noticed the scream coming from my mouth until a large, rough hand clamped down on it. Thrashing and kicking my legs, I fought with all I had, but it was not nearly enough. The man holding me down pinched my nose to cut off any air supply, and I kept trying to kick him or punch him or...or- or anything! I started to spiral into the nothing. All muscles became weak, and my body chilled over... The figure approached me as a lion would stalk up on its hyena prey in the tall blonde glass. For the first time since I woke up, my heart beat a stiff pound that echoed through the dark. With each step the shadow took, an explosion went off inside of me. Heat swelled up in my veins, a sharp, cold breath of air, boom, tension, boom, step, boom…Boom….Boom…..boom.

The cabin is quite large and that's why they set to go there Once they arrive, they explore and divide themselves into 3 rooms Room 1: Abi, Lee Anna and Lucci Room 2: Sierra Katie and Bri Room 3: Ashley Lana and Tanya What the friends don't know is, there is a group of \"mutants\" surrounding the cabin The mutants don't bite or eat to kill, they use weapons of their choice. Once it's night time, the girls throw a little party for themselves and dance and get drunk. Ashley and Lucci end up getting pretty fucked up and dance very provocatively in front of the fire place. Tanya and Sierra go out for a walk in the woods. They get somewhat far from the cabin, and they start to hear rustling in the bushes. They ask if anyone is there, yet they know there will be no reply. Sierra walks slowly to the bushes where the rustling was to check it out Tanya tries to stop Sierra and get her to go back to the cabin with her Sierra ignores Tanya and once she gets to the bushes.. She finds nothing Tanya then screams and Sierra turns around and see's the mutants grab Tanya. Sierra tries to run over to help her but Sierra is also grabbed by one of the mutants. The mutants holding Tanya have weapons, while the mutant holding Sierra does not. Tanya screams for help but one of the mutants pulls out a saw and slashes Tanya's throat, killing her. Sierra screams and breaks free from the mutants hold and runs off to the cabin. When Sierra is almost at the cabin, one of the mutants had set a rope trap, which causes Sierra to trip right in front of the cabin. Sierra screams for help but the music inside is too loud of anyone to hear in there Sierra is dragged into the darkness by the mutants soon after. Bri, Katie, and Lana noticed Tanya and Sierra didn't come back They decide to go outside and look for them Katie and Lana check the RV and Bri checks the woods Bri notices a figure in the distance She runs towards the figure but halfway there the figure disappears. She notices the ground is wet and discovers it's blood. Bri screams at the top of her lungs She finds Tanya's body and is horrified. She turns around and see's the RV is moving a lot. Bri runs back to the RV and comes up to a crying Katie. Katie says \"things\" came inside the RV and attacked them. She got out but Lana was still in there. She couldn't do anything to help her. They heard a loud scream by Lana in the RV. They both go to the RV to try and help Lana but just as they approach it… They see blood splatter on the windows. They come up to the RV door, and a mutant thrashes Lana's body out and it lands on Bri. Katie see's Lana's body is headless and screams. The music inside the cabin is still too loud for anyone to hear them. Bri is still under Lana's body and screams for Katie to help her. Katie is too shocked and panicked and only moves back rather than helping Bri. A mutant comes out of the RV, and Bri screams even louder. Just as Bri gets herself out from under Lana's body, the mutant pulls out his machete and slashes Bri's back. Bri falls to the ground, while letting out a blood curling scream. The mutant puts the machete through Bri's back and Bri lets out one last scream, before she dies. Katie comes out of her shock too late, which she even realizes, and runs back inside the cabin. Lucci and Ashley are a lot more sober when Katie runs in crying. Everyone was gathered in the living room, and they rushed to Katie when she came in. Katie told them they needed to board the cabin up. Everyone was confused and Katie screamed that Bri and Lana were killed, and she thinks Tanya and Sierra were killed too. Lucci doesn't believe her and walks outside. Lana and Bri's bodies are gone. Katie says it was true, but she couldn't prove it since no blood landed on Katie. Ashley and Lee Anna explored around and found no signs of their deaths. The blood on the window was even gone. While everyone was exploring outside, only Abi and Katie were still inside. Abi tells Katie that she believes her, even though she doesn't wanna. Abi said she heard some of the screaming, but thought it was just a joke, or they were fooling around. She even saw strange figures while they were driving to the forest, but thought it was only images in her head. While Lee Anna and Ashley looked inside the RV, Lucci went behind the house. Lucci notices a dent looking thing in the ground. She see's it's actually a door. Lucci, curious, opens the door up and climbs down the ladder. The ladder starts getting slippery, and when Lucci holds her hand up to the light, she see's blood on her hand. She screams, but slips from her hold, and falls down to the bottom of the hole. The fall wasn't too long, but Lucci is still hurt. She looks to her side and see's a lit hallway. A mutant then walks up to her and Lucci realizes Katie was telling the truth. The mutant grabs Lucci and drags the screaming girl down the dirty hallway. Lee Anna and Ashley go back inside the cabin with Katie and Abi. Katie asks where Lucci is. Ashley and Lee Anna look at each other, and then look back at Katie in silence. Abi and Katie's eyes go wide open and run outside with Lee Anna and Ashley right behind. They call Lucci's name, but nothing. They decide to stay together and look around everywhere There is no signs of anything Ashley is too over-whelmed and runs inside the cabin for her safety. She goes to her room, and finds the bodies of Bri, Lana, and Tanya. Ashley screams at the top of her lungs and the other girls race back to her. Ashley then realizes the mutants would have to be inside the cabin. Ashley turns around and a mutant is standing behind her. The mutant swings at Ashley but she ducks. Ashley kicks the mutant and goes for the door. The mutant grabs Ashley's leg and pulls her down hardly. The mutant ends up stabbing Ashley's hand and Ashley screams loudly. The mutant goes for the finish but Katie rushes in and tackles the mutant. Ashley races out of the room to Abi and Lee Anna. The mutant grabs his machete and swings on Katie's back. Katie screams in pain, and the mutant pushes her over, onto Bri's body, and he jams his machete into Katie's chest. The mutant swings at Katie's head and the machete goes into her head, instantly killing her. The 3 girls outside scream and Abi closes the door. They run outside the back door and keep running. While running, Lee Anna falls into the door leading underground, but clenches onto the grass. Lee Anna screams for help and Abi and Ashley help her. They realize that it leads underground and they decide to go down to see if Lucci is there. They close the door, and the mutant that was inside the cabin does not know where they ran off too. They get to the bottom and notice dried up blood. Lee Anna starts breathing heavy and Ashley and Abi shush her. They go down the lit hallway and here movement in the other room. Ashley peaks down the hallway leading into the room with the movement and see's no mutants. The girls move into the room and see Sierra and Lucci tied up, hanging from a pole. They run over to them and Lee Anna goes over to Sierra. Sierra looks up at Lee Anna and starts crying. Abi and Ashley go over to Lucci When they try to wake her up, they notice Lucci's throat was slashed. Abi starts crying and Ashley consoles her. Lee Anna tells them they need to leave, fast, before they come back. Sierra starts walking weird and they can tell she was drugged. Abi and Ashley both carry/drag Sierra, holding her on their shoulders and Lee Anna leads the way. Lee Anna notices a slope and light coming from it Lee Anna looks up, and notices the way out. The girls climb up the slope, while Sierra struggles too, even with the help of Ashley and Abi. They hear movement coming toward the slope and Lee Anna tells them to hurry. Lee Anna makes it to the exit and waits for Abi and Ashley. Abi looks behind her and notices a mutant climbing up after them. The girls scream and Lee Anna screams for them to hurry. The mutant grabs Abi's legs and Abi screams. The mutant kicks her down the slope and Abi lands at the bottom unconscious. Ashley ends up dragging Sierra up to the exit and they both get out. They hesitate but they know they have to leave Abi. Lee Anna, Ashley and Sierra go through the woods the whole night. They hear rustles occasionally and move even faster when they do. Once sunrise occurs, they reach a cliff. They decide to rest at the cliff, since they've been moving for such a long time. Sierra starts crying, saying she's been through so much. She saw Tanya die right in front of her and they dragged her to that cellar/underground thing. Lee Anna and Ashley start trying to figure out where the road might be, where they could find help. They both argue on what direction it was, and what direction they came from. Sierra looks over the cliff, seeing how far the fall is. Sierra sits back where she was, still sniffling. While Lee Anna and Ashley decide on a direction, they turn around to tell Sierra. They see Sierra isn't there. They look around and don't see any signs of her. The thought crosses Lee Anna's mind and she crawls over to the cliff and looks down, and see's a body in a pool of blood… Sierra's body. Lee Anna starts to cry and Ashley cries after she sees it. Ashley says that she should've saw it coming and kept a watch on Sierra, incase she was even thinking about killing herself. Lee Anna tells her it's not her fault, it's the mutants. This gets the 2 back on track. They continue on their way to find help. They see no signs of mutants while walking. In the evening, they hear a girl scream for help. The scream came from Abi. They realized she was close and they looked around and called her name. Abi soon found them and the 3 girls all hugged each other, crying. Abi said she wasn't touched after she fell down the slope, and when she woke up, she ran away into the woods. Ashley brought gum with her, and kept it in her pocket, and she gave it to the 2 girls every once in a while to help control all their hunger. While resting for the night, Lee Anna wakes up to rustling. She quickly wakes up Abi and Ashley and they hear it too. It's too dark for any of them to see much. A mutant grabs Abi and Abi screams loudly The mutant ties a rope around Abi's neck and strangles her to death Ashley and Lee Anna are scrambling to find Abi but they can't in the darkness. Ashley feels a hand on her shoulder and screams. She and Lee Anna run off into the darkness. Lee Anna collapses from weakness after another couple hours of them traveling. They decide together that they would die there. When they are asleep, Ashley feels something shaking her and she screams waking up and finds it's a camper. Ashley cries in relief, and wake Lee Anna up. Lee Anna opens her eyes and smiles but says she can't move, she's too weak. The camper gives Lee Anna water and food and she eventually gets the strength to walk. The camper takes the girls to his RV and gets them help EPILOGUE: Lee Anna and Ashley were the only survivors. Only Abi's body was found, the rest of the bodies were gone. The police searched the underground rooms, but found no mutants and no signs of the bodies.

Fue el único día en que se divirtieron antes de la masacre. Antes del Apocalipsis y todos esos zombis. Jules había puesto un mantel en el suelo, con platos y aperitivos que ella y Dana habían preparado. Se sentaron todos en el pasto. Conversaron sobre trivialidades, y luego sobre cosas serias. Rieron, jugaron y contaron secretos. Dana se recostó sobre en regazo de Holden, sonriéndole con dulzura. Marty observó como Holden la miraba. Sabía que a él gustaba. Como también sabía que a la misma Dana le gustaba. Sintió un apretón de ira en su estómago. No lo pudo evitar. Cerró los ojos. Respiró hondo y miró a un lado. No podía evitar sentir eso. No quería envidiar a Holden. Pero lo estaba haciendo. Apretó las manos. En secundaria, cuando conoció a Jules y salió con ella, descubrió que era parte de algo. De un grupo. Si bien no era grande, se componía de cuatro personas, era algo. Y para alguien que nunca había tenido a nadie, eso era mucho. A Marty se lo consideraba un rarito. Tenía como amigos a Kurt y Dana. Luego él y Jules terminaron en buenos términos. Al parecer, ella estaba locamente atraída por Kurt y viceversa. A Marty no le importó demasiado. Él tampoco estaba enamorado de ella. Y no quería estarlo por un largo rato. Pero él no controla sus sentimientos. Un día, en la clase de arte, la profesora dio un trabajo en parejas. Kurt y Jules lo hicieron juntos, porque ya eran novios. Por lo que Marty se había quedado solo. De nuevo. Dana se acercó a él. - ¿Estas solo Marty? – Él la miró frunciendo el ceño. Era penoso decir que si. Pero esa era la verdad. - Al parecer… - Contestó solamente. - ¿Tu? – Preguntó. Supuso que Dana tendría ya un compañero. Era lógico teniendo en cuenta lo bella que era. Aunque solo se tratara de un simple reporte de arte, nadie ignoraría que era hermosa. - También. – Contestó sonriendo. – Pensé que podía hacerlo con Jules. – Comentó mirándola. – Pero cuando la vi a los arrumacos con Kurt supe que no podría contar con ella. – Rió. Marty pensó que tenía una risa estupenda. Fresca y dulce. –Así que… ¿Quieres hacerlo conmigo? – La pregunta lo tomó por sorpresa, no supo responder. - ¿Eh? – Murmuró torpemente. Ella volvió a reír. - ¿Quieres hacer el trabajo conmigo? – Marty se quedó pensativo. - Si, ¿Por qué no? – Contestó mirándola. - Muy bien. ¿Puedes venir a mi casa hoy? - ¿Hoy? Pero si el trabajo es para dentro de dos meses. – Contestó frunciendo el seño. - Me gusta la anticipación. – Sonrió. - ¿Puedes venir? - Claro. - Muy bien. Nos vemos. Esa tarde, él llegó al departamento de Dana. Era muy lindo. No vivía sola como ahora, porque estaban recién en secundaria, pero sus padres estaban de viaje, como habitualmente por su trabajo. - ¿Y? ¿Qué opinas? – Preguntó ella refiriéndose al departamento. - Es genial. – Contestó mirándola con una sonrisa. - Ven, en la mesa tengo las esculturas de arte, ya las conseguí. - ¿En que momento? – Preguntó sorprendido. – Si recién hoy nos dieron el trabajo. - Ya las tenía. Amo el arte. - Me doy cuenta. – Sonrió. - ¡Ven, vamos! – Gritó tomándolo de la mano y corriendo hacia la mesa de trabajo. - ¿Te gustan? - Wow… son muy lindas. ¿Estas serán las que analizaremos? - Si, por supuesto. – Contestó sonriéndole. - Bueno… a decir verdad, - Empezó Marty hurgando su mochila. – Creo que aquí tenemos una más para el reporte. – Finalizó triunfante sacando una escultura de yeso. Era una bailarina. Los ojos de Dana se agrandaron. - ¡Es hermosa! – Exclamó tomándola. - Si la quieres… te la regalo. – Contestó sentándose. - ¿En serio? – Preguntó incrédula. – ¿De donde la sacaste? - Supuse que te gustaría. La hizo mi hermana mayor antes de mudarse con su novio. – Contestó sonriéndole calidamente. – Intuí que ya tendrías las esculturas, porque no me dijiste nada sobre traer alguna. Pero en mi casa tenía esta. - Si te la regaló tu hermana, no me la deberías regalar a mi. – Dijo Dana dejándola en la mesa. - Prefiero que la tenga alguien que la aprecie más. – Contestó sonriéndole. Dana se sentó a su lado y comenzaron el reporte. Luego de media hora Marty se estiró en la silla. Miró a Dana. Se veía magnífica enfoscada en su trabajo. Observó cada detalle de su rostro. Sus ojos celestes mirando las esculturas, sus cejas rojizas tan perfectamente finas, su nariz proporcional con sus facciones, su boca chica pintada de rosa. Su cabello rojo en ondas que caía al costado de su rostro. Era hermosa. Él sonrió. - Ya, ¿Qué pasa? – Preguntó mirándolo. - ¿Qué? – Preguntó torpemente al verse descubierto. - ¿Tengo algo en la cara? Lo digo porque me estabas mirando. – Marty casi llegó a ruborizarse, pero no lo hizo. - Eh… solamente miraba lo concentrada que estabas. – Sonrió nerviosamente. Ella le devolvió el gesto. - Me comprometo con mi trabajo. – Contestó volviendo la vista a las esculturas. - ¿Cómo crees que le estará yendo a Jules y Kurt? - Supongo que bien. – Contestó Dana. – Es decir, Jules no lo parece, pero es muy inteligente. - Lo se. – Contestó él. Recordó cuando ella le había cancelado algunas salidas por estudiar, y como él de todos modos iba a su casa a verla hacerlo. - Oye Marty, ¿Te gustaría descansar un poco? - Es una gran idea. – Rió al levantarse y seguir a Dana. - ¿Quieres algo de tomar? – Preguntó acercándose a la heladera. - De acuerdo. – Contestó siguiéndola. Ella entró en la cocina y sirvió dos vasos de jugo de naranja. - Toma. – Dijo al darse vuelta, pero Marty estaba más cerca de lo que ella creía y lo chocó tirándole un poco de jugo. - ¡Oh Marty! ¡Lo siento mucho! – Gritó tomando una servilleta y pasándola por su buzo una y otra vez. – Lo siento, lo siento. - Esta bien, no te preocupes. – Contestó alejándose. - Espera, te traeré una camisa de mi hermano. - No, en serio, así esta bien… - Empezó pero Dana hizo caso omiso y le trajo una camisa. – Dana, es solo un poco de jugo, no es cianuro… - Ella rió, pero de todos modos lo mandó a su habitación a cambiarse. Allí descubrió muchas cosas que no sabía de Dana. Su increíble talento para dibujar, sus esculturas, su amor por la música, entre otras cosas. Su curiosidad fue tan grande que abrió su armario. Todos los vestidos colgaban de la percha. Todos eran juveniles y coloridos, como siempre era Dana. Abrió una cajonera, revisó muchas cosas. No pudo evitarlo, su curiosidad era más grande que el respeto hacia la vida privada. Había muchas cosas de mujeres. Maquillaje, cremas, etc… pero entre todas las cosas, encontró un libro. Por supuesto, sabía que su curiosidad no podía llegar tan lejos como para no respetar el diario intimo de su mejor amiga, pero… estaba entre sus manos. Tal vez podría hablar sobre él, tal vez dijese algo, algo que le importara. Abrió el libro y lo ojeó. Las primeras páginas eran de mucho antes, así que fue directamente hacia el final. Descubrió la fecha en la que se conocieron. \"Hoy conocí al amigo-novio \"amigovio\" de Jules. Es un chico de lo más extraño. Quiero decir, ¡es muy diferente a ella! Jules es todo atrevimiento, y él, Marty es lo opuesto. Tengo que admitir que es lindo. Pero no de la manera en que dicen que Kurt es lindo. Kurt es… \"caliente\" pero Marty es lindamente dulce, y bueno. Es un gran chico. Jules sacará buenas cosas sobre esto. Por otra parte…\" Ella había escribo sobre él, ¡había escrito sobre él! Pero aquí hay otra nota que lucía interesante. \"Esto va de mal en peor, hoy Jules me contó que sale con Kurt, le pregunté por Marty, y me contestó: \"Es todo tuyo Dana, se que te gusta. He visto como lo miras. Y la verdad es que yo estoy muy enamorada de Kurt. Así que no pienso más en él. Ah, y soy conciente de que él tampoco me amaba. Creo que tiene a otra persona…\" Esto no va bien. Cada día estoy más enamorada de él, creo que es el indicado.\" - ¡Marty! ¿Sigues ahí? – Gritó Dana. - ¿Te encuentras bien? - Si. – Gritó guardando el libro rápidamente. – ¡Ya voy! Salió de su habitación apresurado. - ¿Qué pasó? – Pregunto ella sonriéndole. - Miraba tus esculturas. Son hermosas. – Mintió. - Oh, gracias. – Contestó acercándose a él.- Te queda muy bien esta camisa. – Cuando levantó la vista hacia él, Marty descubrió que estaban demasiado cerca. Su corazón estaba muy acelerado. Ella se acercó más. Marty corrió unos cabellos de su pelo. – Sabes Marty… tengo ganas de besarte. – Confesó y lo hizo. Él correspondió al beso en un principio. Dana lo agarraba del cuello con delicadeza y él la tomó de la cintura. Eso no podía seguir así. Si tenían más cercanía las cosas se pondrían peor y eso solo los llevaría a un lugar. Inesperadamente Dana lo tiró al sofá. Marty estaba muy asustado, no podía permitir eso cuando ni siquiera sabía que sentía por ella. ¿Solo un cosquilleo en su estomago que se extendía por cada parte de su cuerpo o amor de verdad? No quería hacer nada imprudente sin antes saber. Dana se acostó a su lado e intentó sonreírle. - Ya lo se. – Suspiró. – Esto no es bueno. Lo siento. - Dana yo… - Se quedó sin voz. Por primera vez no supo que decir. – Lo siento. – Ella comprendió al instante que solo la había besado para corresponderle, no porque lo sintiese. - Esta bien. – Contestó levantándose. – No se que quise hacer. – Dijo dándole la espalda. – Lo siento Marty. Éramos amigos y lo arruiné todo. – Suspiró sentándose en una silla. – Si quieres puedo terminar esto sola. No hace falta que… - No Dana. – Dijo levantándose del sofá en el que se encontraba aún acostado. – Estamos juntos en esto, lo tenemos que terminar. – Ella se echó a llorar. – Dana, Dana, ¿Qué ocurre? - Estoy pasando un mal momento. – Sollozó con su voz cortada. Para Marty fue como una daga en su corazón. - ¿Qué pasa? Cuéntame. – Ofreció sentándose a su lado. - No puedo… es… - Dime. – Sonrió. – Puedo ayudarte. - No puedes. – Contestó abrazándolo. - Al menos puedo reconfortarte. – Ella lo miró con su sonrisa quebrada. - Estuve de novia con el profesor Gael. – Confesó escondiendo su rostro. - ¡Dana! – Gritó sorprendido. - ¿Con el profesor de Ciencias? - Si. – Lloriqueó. – Y… me, me dejó. – Dijo apretando la camisa de Marty. – Porque, él tenía solamente veinticuatro, y yo tengo diecisiete. Pero, estaba casado. Y yo, no sabía, y casi, casi… - ¿Casi que? – Preguntó alarmado. - Casi, ya sabes. Casi como ahora nosotros. – Marty palideció. Abrió los ojos de par en par. - Solamente \"Casi\" menos mal. – Suspiró. - ¿Y que pasó? - Nada, simplemente después de eso, él… me dejó. - Pero Dana, vamos en secundaría, ¿Por qué meterte con alguien grande? - Lo se, y lo siento. – Contestó mirándolo a los ojos. – No quería… realmente no quería hacer esto contigo. No tenía que haberte besado, solo quería sentirme querida. – Marty tenía ganas de gritarle en la cara que le gustaba. Pero sería incoherente decirle eso y hacer esto. De todas maneras… ¿Qué podía hacer? Tampoco iba a hacerlo con alguien que no amara. Y no es que no amara a Dana, simplemente él no sabía que sentía. - ¿Quieres que hagamos esto otro día? - De acuerdo. – Contestó levantándose. – Pero si necesitas una mano, un hombro, un consejo o un consuelo, solo… solo llámame ¿Si? – Ella sonrió débilmente. - De acuerdo. – Sonrió y lo acompañó a la puerta. En la salida, él se dio la vuelta para despedirse, pero en vez de darle un beso en la mejilla, le dio un rápido besito en los labios. Dana se quedó sorprendida, luego se recompuso y sonrió. - Y si me lo preguntas…. – Empezó él. – Yo también tenía ganas de besarte. – Sonrió. Ella arqueó las cejas, y luego giró los ojos. - Adiós. - Nos veremos. – Sonrió y le dio la espalda. Ese día Dana se había entregado a él. Pero no había hecho caso. Y ahora tenía que ver como ella y Holden estaban a los arrumacos. Le dio asco. Unas semanas más tarde de ese día en el departamento de Dana, él la vio con un muchacho. Y la ira que se desató adentro de su cuerpo, como la calidez en su estomago cuando ella lo abrazaba, le hizo saber que de verdad la quería. Pensó que se le iba a pasar con el tiempo. Pero terminaron la escuela e iniciaron la universidad y él seguía tan enamorado como siempre. Suspiró. No podía ser peor. - He… chicos. – Susurró levantándose. – Voy a… buscar un cigarrillo. – Terminó entrando a la cabaña. Nadie le prestó demasiada atención. Solo Dana se dio cuenta de que los cigarrillos estaban a su lado. - Voy al baño. – Comentó levantándose. – Ya regreso. – Cuando desapareció por la puerta la única que no pasó inadvertido lo que sucedía era Jules, como siempre. Ella sabía que antes, en el secundario, Dana había estado muy enamorada de Marty y sabía que ahora él lo estaba de ella. Cuando Dana cruzó el umbral vio a Marty sentado en el sofá con la cabeza entre las manos. Sabía que algo no andaba bien con él. Se sentó a su lado sin que lo notara. - ¿Qué ocurre? – Preguntó mirándolo con una sonrisa calida. Él se sobresaltó y luego la miró. - Nada, solo… pensaba. - ¿En que? – Preguntó recostando su cabeza en el regazo de Marty. - En muchas cosas. - ¿Cosas como cuales? - Bueno, solo… pensaba en la secundaria. - ¿Qué cosa sobre eso? - ¿Por qué quieres saber? - Porque te veo mal, y quiero apoyarte en lo que sea. Como tú lo hiciste aquella vez. – Comentó mirándolo con calidéz. Él sonrió. - De eso pensaba. - ¿Cuándo me consolaste? - Bueno, no específicamente, pero si sobre ese día. – Hizo una pausa. – Lo siento. - Deja de decir eso. – Dijo Dana sentándose de nuevo. – Ya lo he entendido. - No me refiero a eso. No me disculpo por no quererte como tu, bueno a decir verdad… me disculpo por no haberte querido esa vez. Porque cometí un error. – Terminó mirando al frente. - ¿A que te refieres? – Preguntó ladeando la cabeza. - A que si me hubiese dado cuenta antes de lo mucho que te quiero, las cosas serían diferentes. Y lo siento, por dejar que el tiempo pase. – Ella frunció el seño. Sacudió su cabeza alejando un pensamiento de su mente. - Marty… yo estaba enamorada de ti en ese momento. No puedo prometerte que ahora será igual. No quiero lastimar a nadie. Ni a Holden ni a ti. A nadie. - Lo se, lo se. Ya sabía que ibas a decir eso. Pero… hizo falta verte con otros chicos para darme cuenta de que te amaba. Y eso es demasiado tarde. Lo siento. – Terminó girando su cuerpo para darle la espalda. - ¿Puedes dejar de decir \"Lo siento\" es lo único que no quiero escucharte decir nunca más. - Discúlpame. - Marty…- Empezó con tono acusador. – Es lo mismo. Que te disculpes cuando es tarde, o que te disculpes cuando no me amaste no me sirve de nada. Y no te culpo por no amarme, porque ¿Qué podías hacer? No me amabas y listo. Pero luego te rendiste. Nunca viniste a decirme nada. Te quedaste en ese \"Lo siento\" porque pensabas que yo no te quería más. Lo que es ridículo. Yo no insistí más. Supuse que si ibas a querer decirme algo, ibas a hacerlo tú. Pero no lo hiciste, y di por sentado que no te interesaba. No quiero oír disculpas. Quiero que me digas lo que te pasa de verdad. – Marty se quedó con los ojos bien abiertos mirándola con un brillo de duda. Luego miró a un lado. - Dana… siempre te he querido. Y nunca tuve el valor de decírtelo. Te amo. – Cuando se giró a verla ella tenía la cabeza ladeada con una sonrisa. - ¿Sabes cuanto he sufrido por eso? – Emitió con una carcajada. - Lo se, y por eso, lo siento mucho, de verdad. Pero cuando te vi con otros muchachos, pensé que ya no sentías nada por mi, y luego Holden y… - A ellos nunca los podría amar como te amo a ti. – Confesó mirándolo con una sonrisa de lado. – Y solo… deja de disculparte. - ¿Y que pasa con Holden? - Ya Jules se encargará de encontrarle una novia. Quizás tarde un tiempo, como nosotros. Pero lo hará. - Él la besó con calidez y con dulzura. Con un amor a prueba de todo. Como por ejemplo zombis o rituales aterradores. Una rubia escondida en el umbral de la puerta sonrió. Le había tomando mucho tiempo que declararan su amor. Pero por fin Jules consiguió que Marty y Dana se besaran de verdad… Ahora solo una cosa… ¿Dónde habrá una novia para Holden?

Usual disclaimer stuff goes here,nblah, blah blah. :) * * * * * * The night had descended on Long Beach, California at a reasonablenhour, and the sleepy area was just now waking, stretching through thenstreets with a vibrant and swift urgency. People worked, and people played.nSporty, impressive cars of all shapes and sizes drove about, men and womannalike in the driving seat. The moon hung lazily in the clear sky amidst thenstarts, watching casually as the night unfolded, the hour pressing onnquickly. In the bar close to the pier, things were just getting interesting.nAlcohol flowed, money was spent and earned, and the constant haze andnstench of cigarettes was hanging resiliently in the low-lit air. Musicnplayed at a considerably comfortable level, drowned out only by thenfrequent laughter of a rowdy group of people seated in a large booth in thencorner. They had three pitchers of beer, and showed signs of turning thentown upside down later if they consumed enough of it. The usual collection of middle-aged men desperate to fit in fillednthe bar stools, noticed and acknowledged only by the barman. They dranknbeer after beer, and watched everyone discreetly. There were a small number of women dotted around, the same old kindnwho only wanted to know you if you lived hard, drove fast, and had a walletnfull of cash. They were on the hunt for every woman's typical ideal man...nthe desirable, mysterious, handsome and loaded young man who would keepnthem entertained until they found something newer, younger and richer. Two young men played pool in the corner, not saying much, theirnsilence a signal to everyone else that they weren't here to socialise,ncause trouble, or be on the receiving end of any. They just wanted to drinknbeer, and have fun, and stumble home at the end of it al. when they didnspeak, the conversation revolved around anything with four wheels and anpowerful engine. The first was standing at the side of the table, his pool cue in onenhand, and a half-empty beer in the other. He watched the table with curiousneyes and shrugged his shoulders loosely under his hooded sweater. Hisnslacks were black, and his worn sneakers had seen better days. His brownnhair was gelled right back, styled so that it wouldn't get in his face. Thendenim jacket he often wore hung on a rack off to the side. The second young man was considering the table carefully withninquisitive blue eyes. His dark blonde hair was spiked, giving him anmischievous, youthful air. His knuckles were just visible below the widencuffs of his black jacket, collar of a red shirt showing over the top. Hisnbaggy jeans efficiently covered most of his boots, the chain hanging fromnthe belt loop disappearing into his side pocket. He wore two solid silvernrings on the last two fingers of his left hand, his large heavy silvernbracelet only showing when he twisted his wrist to grip the cue. He hadnshaved all but most of the sideburns of his facial hair, and no longernlooked as daunting as he had not long ago. \"Are you going to shoot before last orders?\" Kip Raines murmured, hisnvoice on the border of audible as the speaker churned out a steady rhythm. Tommy 'Tumbler' Tumble turned his gaze upon his long-time friend, andnsmiled his most charming smile. He bent over the table, lined up his shot,nand potted the eight ball with irritating ease. He laughed softly tonhimself, seeing the flash of defeat in his best friend's eyes, beforentriumphantly saying, \"Your round.\" He shook his empty beer bottle fornemphasis. Kip rolled his eyes, leaned his cue against the wall, and grumbled,n\"Don't you wanna get outta here already?\" Tumbler leaned against the table, raising a single eyebrow. \"You'renjust trying to find a way to get outta buying me another beer.\" Kip dug around in his deep pocket for some change, and replied, \"No.nI can afford the beer.\" His friend grinned knowingly. Kip didn't have a lot of cash recently.nHe had been saving it all up for a car. Not just any car... no, it had tonthe right kind of car. He just wasn't sure what that was yet. It would comento him. He just needed to think about it and be patient. \"All I'm worried about it how you're going to drive when you'rendrunk,\" Kip continued, throwing Tumbler a look. Tumbler let his head sink for a moment, before he sighed. He stood tonhis full height, replaced his cue and grabbed Kip's jacket, tossing it atnhim. The denim jacket hit Kip in the side of the head, clung to hisnshoulder for a moment, and then fell to the floor. Kip glanced curiously to Tumbler, blinking once in question. Tumbler motioned for the door, and said, \"Let's go.\" \"I didn't mean we had to leave now,\" Kip told him, not sure who henwas trying to convince. He scooped up his jacket, and slipped it on. Tumbler smiled. \"It's okay. I'm running outta cash anyway.\" Henstarted for the door, Kip right behind him. One of the young women by the door laid a hand on Tumbler's arm as henwas about to pass. \"Fancy taking me for a drive?\" she asked him in a voice that shenprobably thought passed for seductive, sweet and innocent. She wasn't evennclose. She was half-drunk, and looked more than a little stoned. Tumbler took hold of her hand, and dropped it again, saying, \"Maybensome other time.\" The woman pouted, trying to look deeply offended, before throwing anglance to Kip. Kip stifled a laugh, and hurried out of the door after his friend. Tumbler took one look back at the bar, and started laughing, thenaffects of five or more beers starting to sink in. he closed his eyes, rannhis hands over his spiky blonde hair, and then managed to stop laughing. Kip's hand jabbed towards him, palm up, and his eyes stared tonTumbler, who simply gaze back blankly. \"What?\" Kip sighed, and pushed his hand into Tumbler's jacket pocket, fingersnmoving around searchingly. \"Man, what the hell are you doing? Mugging me or something?\" Tumblernqueried with half a chuckle. \"No, I'm lookin' for your keys,\" Kip informed him simply, onlynslightly amused at his friend's sudden succumbing to inebriation. Tumbler's left hand casually shoved Kip back, and then disappearedninto his pants' pocket. He pulled out the chain, showing Kip the set ofnkeys hanging off the end. \"Give 'em to me,\" Kip said dryly, suddenly quite tired, though henwasn't sure why. He reached out to take the keys. \"Hey,\" Tumbler began, pulling them out of reach, \"I can do it. Whaddanyou think I am? Stupid?\" \"That's debateable,\" Kip grumbled as he watched the other man fiddlenwith task of unhooking the keys. Impatient, Kip moved over, easily took the keys out of Tumbler'snhand, and moved about removing them from the chain. \"Hey,\" Tumbler complained, furrowing his brow, \"I could've done it.\" \"Yeah?\" Kip said, removing the keys and leading the way to the car,nletting the chain dangle around his friend's shin. \"Probably would havenfallen over before that.\" He smiled, hearing Tumbler moving behind him,neven as they arrived at the red Nova. Kip moved to the driver's seat, Tumbler coming up beside him as henunlocked the door to the classic car. \"What are you doing? This is my car,\" Tumbler told his friend, givingnhim a gentle shove. \"I'm supposed to drive.\" \"And you'd crash it too,\" Kip informed him simply, locking gazes withnhim, and raising his eyebrows. \"Get in the passenger side.\" He didn't move. \"Tumbler,\" Kip began, pointing to the right side of the vehicle, \"getnin the passenger side. You're not drivin', okay? I'm driving you home.\" \"I can drive my own car... Kip,\" Tumbler stated, seeming to havenmomentary trouble recollecting his friend's name. It was Kip's turn to shove, gently, for fear of throwing thenmarginally shorter -yet stronger- man right off balance. \"You couldn't walk twenty feet without a map,\" Kip retorted, givingnhim a warning stare, \"and then you'd still get lost. Now, get in thenpassenger side already.\" Tumbler scoffed, and moved around the car, speaking as he went, hisnvoice loud, \"If you scratch my car, I'll kick your ass.\" Kip watched his friend practically fall in the car, rolled his eyes,nand climbed behind the wheel with a discreet smile.[Chapter 2] The Shelby Mustang roared down the freeway, picking up speedngradually, gliding smoothly and with ease past slower vehicles, leavingntheir drivers looking on jealously as the GT 500 sped away. She was finallynfinished, a well-oiled machine, perfectly tuned and cleaned to a shine. The driver sat comfortably in the left hand side of the car, hisnhands rested casually on the steering wheel, watching the road unfold aheadnof him as he steered his Mustang to his destination. He had had a lot ofnpractise in this particular car, and he was pretty sure there was nothingnhe couldn't do in 'Eleanor'. The incident a little over a year ago hadnproven that. Of course, 'Eleanor' had looked a little worse for wear afternthat particular boost, but his younger brother had bought her for him, andnnow she was all his... perfectly legal. 'Eleanor' was finally his, and innperfect working order. Sighing a sigh of content, Randall 'Memphis' Raines turned off thenfreeway, and reduced speed, heading on his way to the garage to lend a handnto his old friend. He had promised to try and held restore an old Ford. Memphis had been helping out at Otto Halliwell's garage since the bignboost last year, and felt better for helping out, after all the older mannhad done to help. He and his wife were good people, decent people working ansolid honest life. Junie and Otto appreciated Memphis helping out, evennthough they had tried a couple of times to insist it wasn't necessary. As he pulled into the yard outside the large building, he smiled,nlooking out at the old cars in need of restoration, new parts, or justnsalvaging. Memphis wouldn't admit it to anyone, least of all Otto, but henactually loved coming here to help out five days a week. Otto gave him somenmoney for his services, and that was all Memphis really needed. That and 'Eleanor'. Memphis parked the Mustang carefully, pulled out the key, and climbednfree of the car, running his hand down the smooth exterior as he closed thendoor, locking it after him. Last thing he wanted was for some amateur tontry and boost her, or even just damage her. He walked the short distance to the wooden door, and pulled it open,nstepping inside, and welcoming the large mastiff that greeted him withnlolling tongue and wagging tail. Memphis laughed, and was too busy petting the dog to notice someonenapproach. \"Morning,\" they said to him, causing him to start a little. He lookednup to them, and smiled. It was Otto, a rag in his greasy hands, and toolsnhanging in his work belt. His overalls had seen better -if not cleaner-ndays, and his glasses hung on a chain around his neck. His recedingnhairline gave him an air of experience and wisdom, and the gentle eyesnlooked down welcomingly. \"Hey, Otto,\" Memphis returned, standing from petting the dog, andnpatting it on the head a couple of times to send it away. It padded off tonits grubby blankets, and locked its teeth around an old license plate. \"You ready to start on that Ford?\" Otto inquired, jabbing a thumbnover his shoulder to the classic vehicle, sitting patiently, and waitingnfor restoration. It looked like it had been through a bit of a battle, butnseemed worth saving. It was doable. \"Sure.\" Junie poked her head out of the office, smiling pleasantly, andnholding out a mug. \"Coffee, Memphis?\" He grinned in response, and nodded. He watched the woman disappear,nand heard her fish out the necessary items to make him his drink. \"I'll just go change,\" Memphis told Otto, seeing his acknowledgingnnod, and paced off to don a pair of overalls. As he walked, he whistled anlight tune to himself, listening to the sounds of tools in cars, and thenrevving of motors as other workers tested engines. It didn't take Memphis long to change, coming out from the small roomnwith a pair of overalls, white T-shirt exposed, the top half of hisncoveralls hanging around his waist, the arms tied in a knot. It was warmnday in Long Beach, and apparently Otto had realised, as he opened the largenmain doors to the garage. Memphis smiled, and jogged back over to help with the car. * * * Sara 'Sway' Wayland finally managed to drag herself out of bed atnaround nine o'clock, yawning exaggeratedly, and stretching refreshingly,nher blonde locks of hair hanging in a mess around her head and face. Shengroaned lazily, and brushed them aside with a hand, shaking her head tonclear her vision. Memphis was already gone, she surmised, glancing over at the emptynhalf of the bed he always slept on. It was tidy and neat, and screamednRandall Raines in its organisation. There were no sounds in the rest of thenapartment. He had gone to the garage. Sway stood from the mattress, glancing out of the window, with itsnpartially opened blinds, and saw the rush and bustle of Long Beach as itnstarted to wake. She admired a few vehicles as they passed, and crossednfrom the bedroom into the lounge-come-kitchen. Her feet carried her to the percolator at once, where Memphis hadnkindly and considerately decided to leave her some coffee. She smilednsleepily, rubbed her tired eyes, and poured herself a mug, adding somensugar. This was just what she needed, she realised as she walked across tonthe couch. A good cup of fresh coffee. She curled up on the couch, andnturned on the TV, bringing up her sock-covered feet onto the soft cushions,nand sighing. There wasn't a lot on the TV at this time of morning, she soonnnoticed, as she flicked through the channels, still waking. There were thenusual daytime soaps, a few game shows, and an old movie. She hung about onnthe movie for a while, before realising it was of no interest to her. Shenturned off the television, activating the stereo instead, hearing thenblaring of rock music soon begin. Another smile. Her favourite. Not really ideal early-morningnlistening, but it was doing a good job of waking her up. That, on top ofnthe coffee, did the trick. After drinking her coffee, and managing to eat a slice of toast, shendressed herself in sleeveless short top, and tight jeans, slipping on hernboots afterwards, tidying her hair presentably. Nodding her head along to the beat, she thought about what to do withnherself. It was Saturday. She didn't have to work at the bar tonight, andnshe had long since quit her job at that car place downtown. If she wantednto work with cars, she knew exactly where to go. Well, it's not like there's much else to do, she mused, nabbing hernleather jacket off of its hook on the wall, and slipping it on comfortably,nshutting off the stereo, knowing the neighbours would be relieved she wasngoing out. Snatching her keys out of the dish by the door, she left thenapartment, and made her way immediately down to the parking lot where hernYamaha was parked safely. * * * Lyle Shepherd was a man who demanded the best, and always got what henwanted. He was a tough man, a daunting man, and when he was disappointed, anviolent man. He had only been in Long Beach for three months, but wasnalready growing quite attached to it. He had gathered quite a fewnconnections in his time at Long Beach, but it still wasn't enough for him. His crew were scarce, few and far between. It wasn't what he wanted.nHe needed to build himself up here, let people know what he was all about.nLyle Shepherd wanted his reputation known. He sat behind his ratty desk, staring at the lone picture that satnframed on his desk, and the smile on the face of his late wife was almostnenough to make him forget who he was. He was no longer the loving husbandnand devoted father he had once been. No. Now he was a changed man. Somenwould say for the better, and some would say for the worst. He stood from his desk, crossed the room to the door, and stared outnover the balcony at the work going on below. Cars and motorbikes sat below,nsome old, some new, all valuable and desirable. There were Fords, Yamahas, a couple of Porsches, and even a fewnMercedes, as well as a couple of old Volvos, and a Ferrari. Lyle Shepherd sighed, and groaned, rubbing his eyes. Why were hisnpeople having so much trouble with this? He had told them to collect thesenvehicles over a week ago, and they only had about thirteen at most. Henneeded a considerable amount more. For many years, since the death of his wife, the loss of hisndaughter, and the disbanding of his fortune and reputation, Lyle Shepherdnhad been dealing in whatever he could get his hands on. He had managed tonamass quite a few respectable clients, but he was after the big buck. Henwanted the big deals. And this was one of them. It was just taking too long. He had mentioned this to his boys thenprevious day, and they had gone out in search of information, names ofnpeople they could use to help them. By help, he meant do the work that hisncrew obviously couldn't do themselves, whether said people really wanted tonhelp or not. Local police and detectives had already arrested two of his boys, andnthey were sniffing close. He couldn't afford to lose this deal. It wasnworth too much money. The opening of the door caught his eye, and he turned his head in thendirection of two of his boys entering, conversing quietly, and holding anfew items in their hands. From his position up on the balcony, LylenShepherd couldn't make out what they were. They moved up to him immediately, two men similar in skills, and bothnvery capable. They had been the only successful workers in Lyle Shepherd'sncrew so far. One of them was taller than the other, a shock of bleachednhair his most striking feature, on top of the almost ice blue eyes and wrynsmile. His name was Lennox. The second was slightly rounder than the first, but a big built man,nstrong and sly. His darker skin hid dark eyes, and was topped off withngelled black hair. He was somewhat an emotionless man, never quitencomfortable with showing others how he felt about whatever was going on. Henwas known as Ox. That bothered Lyle Shepherd very little. He just wanted to know whatnthey had managed to dig up. He led the way back into his office, and sat back down, the two mennstanding before the desk, and looking to him. \"What have you got for me?\" he asked of them in a smooth voice, hisntone curious and insistent. Ox held out a thin file to Lyle Shepherd, one he took instantly andnstarted to peruse. He thumbed through the papers, and unclipped the Polaroids attachednto the top of the pages. He glanced through them with mild interest. \"We managed to get the names of some car thieves... good ones too,\"nLennox told him, arms crossed over his broad chest, the leather jacket donenup tightly. Ox took up his cue to speak almost immediately, and continued, \"Whatnwe managed to find out is that there are, from what we can gather, twoncrews, not just one. A little over a year ago, they joined together, andnpulled off a fifty car boost in one night.\" Lyle Shepherd's eyes rose instantly, and he considered Ox seriously,nas if waiting for the joke to reach a pinnacle. Ox was deadly sincere. Thenlook in his dark eyes confirmed it. Ox was not a joker, as opposed tonLennox. \"And they didn't get caught?\" Lyle Shepherd inquired, intrigued now,nas he inspected the photos again, taking in the faces of the people in thenimages. \"Nope,\" Lennox replied simply. \"They came close on the last car, anShelby GT 500.\" \"We did manage to find out that the cars never made it out of LongnBeach though,\" Ox interjected. \"Someone tipped off the cops, and they werenimpounded, and then returned to their owners.\" Lyle Shepherd leaned back in the leather chair pensively; the photosnset out in a line before him. \"And this is all of them?\" \"From what we could tell,\" Ox confirmed, nodding once, and movingnforward. \"We couldn't manage to find two of them, a man and a woman. Thenman is the big one, the brains you could say. He pulled off the last boost,norganised it all, and everything. But we couldn't find him. Known asnMemphis Raines.\" \"A woman?\" Lyle Shepherd was confused. He rarely heard of female car-nthieves. It was interesting to him. \"Yeah,\" Lennox said to him, \"known as Sway. She's pretty good.\" Lyle Shepherd nodded, and pointed to the photos. \"So who do we havenhere?\" \"We've got Otto Halliwell and Atley Jackson,\" Ox informed him,npointing to the first photo, showing two men in conversation outside ofnwhat seemed to be a garage of some sort. \"Halliwell owns his own chop shop,nand Jackson was the intermediary for the last boost between the crew andnthe dealer. These guys are pros, but from what I hear, they don't actuallyndo the stealing themselves.\" Lyle Shepherd nodded, and indicated for Ox to move on to the nextnphoto. It showed a large black man climbing out of what appeared to be anstudent driver car. \"This here is Donny Astricky,\" Ox continued matter-of-factly.n\"Teaches new drivers over at the DMV. Old friends with Halliwell andnJackson. Old school, and a expert with the tricky work.\" Ox moved on to the third picture, a tall imposing man with a gravenlook on his face, narrowed eyes, and hard lines. His short, close-cut hairngave him a military air. \"This guy is known as 'The Sphinx'. Doesn't speak a word, but quite anhandful. Not the most gentle creature, if you understand what I'm saying,nbut damn good at what he does.\" The fourth photo was of three young men. The first was clearlynyounger, with a full head of tousled blonde hair, and an innocentnexpression. He carried a backpack over one shoulder, and wore a jacket thatnseemed a size too big. The second looked as though he had lived on thenstreets for a number of years, a young man with longer black hair and anstreetwise smile. His leather jacket and dark garments suggested he knewnhow to dress to ward others away. The third and final young man was black,nwith sunglasses completely covering his eyes. He wore baggy brand namenclothing, and had a bandana tied around his head. He appeared carefree, andnwas grinning like an idiot. \"These three are part of the other crew, the younger crew, led by thenbrother of the head honcho. This here is Toby, a computer genius. He gotnshot on the last boost when he got in over his head. Not too good with thenstealing, but a whiz with the complicated computer stuff. Here we have anguy called Freb, known to tag along with a boost, but never really heard ofnhim actually doing one solo. Finally, there's the little one, 'Mirror Man',nwho has actually stolen a car himself. Known as somewhat of a technicalnknow-it-all, he can break into quite a few locked garages with the rightnequipment.\" Lyle Shepherd was growing interested, and he rested his elbows on thenarmrests of his expensive chair, pointing to the last photo. Two young mennwere standing outside what seemed to be a bar at night. They stood beside anclassic red and black car, and seemed to be talking. The first was a tough-nlooking kid, shorter than the other, if only slightly, with spiky blondenhair and large sideburns. He was fiddling with a set of keys, and appearednas though he had consumed a certain amount of alcohol at the time. Thensecond was trying to take the keys off of the first, clean-shaven face andngelled hair making him presentable yet carrying an air of streetwisenknowledge. His casual appearance contrasted somewhat to the jacket andnshirt of his companion. \"And who are these two?\" Lyle Shepherd inquired curiously, jabbing atnthe photo. \"Ah.\" Ox almost showed a smile. \"Now here are two kids who know hownto boost cars, if you know what I'm saying.\" Ox leaned forward on the tablenon his knuckles, and spoke confidently, \"The one playing with the keys isnknown as Tumbler, a rough kid who is fond of his cars. Quite violent ifnprovoked, but can pretty much drive anything with an engine.\" Ox paused,nseeing the nod from his employer. Lyle Shepherd was impressed. \"And thenother kid is the leader of the younger crew. His name is Kip Raines. Veryngood with a boost, but somewhat spontaneous.\" Ox stood to his full height, and looked to Lennox. \"These youngernones will take risks to pull off a boost, but the older crew are sly,ntricky. Working together, they could bring in your deal and close it beforenthe cops even knew what was going on.\" Lyle Shepherd smiled, nodding to himself. \"This is good... nicenwork.\" Ox and Lennox simply nodded. \"Bring me these two,\" Lyle Shepherd ordered with a wry smile, seeingnOx and Lennox acknowledge, before leaving. As they closed the door, henleaned back in his chair. \"Let's see if we can wet their appetites.\"[Chapter 3] Memphis heard the engine of the motorcycle rumble from outside thenshop, and allowed himself a smile. He wondered how long it would take fornher to get here. With very little to keep her entertained on a Saturday,nshe usually drove down to Otto's to see what was happening, and if shencould lend a hand herself. He saw her walk through the door, slipping off her leather jacket,nand removing her helmet, placing them carefully and surprisingly neatly onna workbench near the door, heading straight over to the old Ford they werenworking on. She planted a kiss on him, and smiled. \"What you working on?\" Memphis sighed, and rubbed his filthy hands on a rag, replying, \"Thisnold Ford. Remember I told you about it? It's quite a job though. Might takenus a while.\" Sway nodded, her blonde hair moving about her face and resting on hernshoulders beautifully in controlled locks. Her blue eyes considered him.nShe was bored. \"You can give us a hand if you want,\" called Otto from underneath thenhood, the sounds of tools clanking from within. There was a small curse,nand the older man poked his head up from his work, shaking his hand. Sway smiled, and glanced between the two. \"Sure. I know when I'mnneeded.\" She giggled and went to grab herself some overalls, leavingnMemphis to look on after her. * * * Kip knocked on the door three times and waited, leaning against thenwall near the doorframe itself. He knocked again, louder this time, andnrolled his eyes. Apparently, the beer had taken more of an affect than Kipnhad thought, and his friend probably wasn't even out of bed yet. Kip sighed, and shoved the toe of his boot into the bottom of thendoor three times in succession, the loud knocking carrying down the quietncorridor. The cheap apartment building was dead, and no one was around,napart from the crazy woman who lived in the place down the hall. She alwaysncomplained about the noise, and gave them hassle, shouting that she wasngoing to call the police if they didn't keep it down. There was the sound of something being knocked over from inside,nfollowed by an abrupt quiet curse, before the familiar rattle of a chainnbeing thrown aside was heard. Another lock was undone, and then the doornopened, displaying a rather tousled looking young man. Kip smiled. \"Hung-over?\" Tumbler groaned, and pulled a somewhat comical expression, rubbing anhand over his hair and face. He was dressed in long shorts and sleevelessnwhite vest, his hair a mess of blonde spikes atop his head. His blue eyesnstared at Kip, and he no doubt had a headache. Kip laughed, and Tumbler let him in. The latter walked away from thendoor, and climbed over the mess in his small apartment, collapsing on thencouch where he had obviously fallen asleep the previous night... or rather,nearly morning. Kip had managed to drag Tumbler in at about three o'clock.nTheir drive home had taken an unexpected detour. Kip stood amidst the dishevelled belongings, amongst which werenclothes, a small number of empty bottles, a few car magazines and an oldnacoustic guitar that probably hadn't been played in a while. Tumbler sat up on the couch, and stared up at Kip, eyes narrowed.n\"What are you doing here? It's early.\" He rubbed his eyes, and scratchednthe back of his head subconsciously, looking around at the mess; clearlynamazed he had managed to get through it all when he'd got home. Kip laughed once again, and pointed at the clock on the wall, whichnhe soon realised had stopped, instead pocketing his hands, and saying,n\"Early? It's gone eleven.\" He was still smiling when Tumbler threw him anlook of amazement. He obviously hadn't known it was that late. \"We're gonnango check out some cars today, remember?\" Tumbler nodded, glancing about as if searching for something, andnmumbled, \"Yeah, yeah, I remember.\" He frowned. \"Just give me a few minutes,nand I'll be ready.\" \"You sure you can drive today?\" Kip teased, earning himself a glare. Tumbler moved off to the bathroom, shutting the door behind him,nleaving Kip to grin about his friend's state and the mess in the apartment.nHe should have expected this. Kip sat at one of the kitchen stools, and thumbed casually through ancar magazine, admiring a few of the pictures there, and quickly moving onnwhen he saw the prices attached. He had to remember to be reasonable aboutnhis purchase, if he ever found a car. After about ten minutes, Tumbler emerged from the bathroom, somewhatntidier than before, and shuffled into the bedroom to change. Kip heard himnopen the closet, and pull something out. His attention was soon back on the magazine, as he waited patiently. Another five minutes passed, and Tumbler came out of the bedroom,nfully dressed. He had slipped on a short-sleeved bowling shirt with thennickname 'Tumbler' stitched onto it in red, with a fresh sleeveless vestnunderneath. His baggy jeans had been replaced, and the trademark chainndangled halfway out of the pocket, his car keys reattached to the end afterntheir night out. His hair had been redone, and stuck up in styled spikes ofnblonde, growing lighter towards the tips. The light reflected through the window off of his two silver ringsnand chunky bracelet as he turned to Kip. Kip hopped off the stool, and shut the magazine, having not foundnanything in his price range. They started for the door, before Kip stifledna laugh. \"Um... Tumbler?\" His friend turned back to him, and waited. \"Might need some shoes, pal.\" Kip pointed. Tumbler looked down, donned a confused expression that seemed to shownhe had thought he'd already had footwear on, and quickly grabbed his thicknboots off the floor, shoving them on and tying them securely. Kip was still smiling as they went out the door, hearing Tumbler slamnit behind him. There came the familiar whining voice from down the hallway,nshortly before a head poked out of the door from the other end. They werenwalking away as she shouted, \"Keep the noise down! What have I told younabout the noise!\" Tumbler rolled his eyes with a sigh, and called back, \"Alright, MissnFletcher, whatever you say.\" They had started descending the stairs as the woman shouted somethingnin response, but they were too far away to hear... or care. It was a marvelnthe woman hadn't heard Kip bringing Tumbler up in the morning. The noisenhis friend was making had been somewhat amazing for someone who had barelynbeen able to climb the stairs without falling backwards every few seconds. They emerged into the sun of the Long Beach day, and Tumbler fishednhis keys out of his pocket, saying as he did so, \"You gotta get me somencoffee or something.\" \"You've got coffee inside!\" Kip told him as he unlocked the '69 Nova. \"Not anymore I don't,\" Tumbler replied, climbing in, pulling down hisnshade to keep the sun out of his eyes as he located the ignition. \"Haven'tnhad coffee for a week. Mirror Man used it all.\" Kip sighed loudly, and got in the car, closing the door after him,nand hearing the engine roar into life. \"Fine. We get some coffee, and thennwe look for my new car.\" \"If you can ever decide what kind of car you want,\" Tumblerncommented, pulling out of the parking lot, and onto the road, his eyesnlooking out for other cars and pedestrians as he did so. He drove with onenhand on the wheel, the other rested on the rolled down window edge as theynmoved. Kip slouched back in the seat and shrugged. \"It takes time. I'llnfigure it out, just you wait.\" \"You can pick a car for your brother,\" Tumbler began, furrowing hisnbrow as they stopped at a red light, \"but you can't decide what you wantnfor yourself.\" Kip let the conversation drop for the time being, and directednTumbler to a place where they could get some breakfast. * * * The Ford had decided to start behaving at around midday, when Memphisnwas on the verge of smacking it with a spanner. The engine had splutteredninto life after Sway's third attempt, and cheers had sounded through thenshop. It was far from complete, but at least the girl started now. \"Whadda you say we go out for drinks tonight?\" Sway offered Memphis,nstanding rather seductively by the hood of the vehicle, holding anscrewdriver in her hand, and turning it end over end repeatedly. Memphis turned to her, and smiled. \"What brought this on?\" \"I dunno,\" she replied, shrugging loosely beneath her unzippednoveralls, revealing a grubby T-shirt she had found in the back room. \"Inguess the success here has fuelled it my need to celebrate... withnalcohol.\" Memphis chuckled to himself, and nodded. \"Okay, sure. Drinksntonight.\" \"Great,\" Sway muttered happily, and ambled away to talk with Junie,nwho was watching from the office with mild interest. The two soon got tonconversing, and it wasn't long before the sounds of their laughter werenheard. They got along as if they had known each other their whole lives. Memphis got back to work under the hood, hearing Otto speak to himnfrom around the car somewhere. He was out of sight, but in audible range,nas he said, \"So, how are things with your brother? I haven't seen himnaround for a couple of weeks.\" \"Wouldn't really know,\" Memphis replied casually, frowning tonhimself. \"I haven't spoken to him myself in a week. Last I heard, he wasnlooking for a car.\" \"As in 'to buy', right?\" Otto queried, poking his head under tonregard his old friend seriously. The look in his eyes was unmistakable asnconcern. Memphis nodded. \"That's what he said to me. Told me Tumbler was gonnangive him a hand.\" \"Why wouldn't he ask you for help?\" Otto asked, taking a rag out ofnhis pocket, and wiping it over the car's exterior slowly. Memphis came out from under the raised hood, and sighed, arms restednon the front of the car, as his eyes found Otto. \"I'm not sure. Maybe he'sngetting more independent. I don't know. I just hope he and Tumbler keepnoutta trouble... and by getting a car, Kip means with money and keys.\" Otto nodded wordlessly in agreement, and shuffled off to finish upnsome neglected paperwork. Memphis watched him go, furrowing his brow at the possibility of hisnbrother getting himself back into trouble, and ducked back under the hoodnof the Ford to work.[Chapter 4] Tumbler and Kip had taken to walking at around one-thirty, the heatnof the California sun too much to handle in the car. They had parked it upnin a secure place, and Tumbler had pocketed his keys again, feeling betternfor eating and getting some coffee, kindly funded by his friend. As they walked, their eyes searched for advertisements of potentialncars for Kip, and as they passed each dealership, they casually glancednabout. There wasn't much on offer. When it hit two o'clock, the two walked by the pier, grateful for thenbreeze that was on offer there, and watched the cars go by every so often.nPeople passed in couples and groups, throwing the two odd looks, as thoughnthey expected to be jumped any minute. Tumbler looked out at the water, rested forward on a railing with hisnarms crossed, and listened to the pesky gulls as they passed overhead. Kipnstood beside him, hands shoved pensively in his pockets, eyes glancingnabout as if the perfect purchase would pass him by any moment. Needless to say, he would be disappointed. \"You planning to do this all day?\" Tumbler asked of him, glancingnback through narrowed eyes as the sun shone down on them warmly. The breeze tugging at the hood of his sweater, Kip shrugged. \"I guessnnot. I can't seem to find anything anyway.\" \"What about that Cadillac we found near Starbucks? That wasn't toonexpensive,\" Tumbler offered, finding his gaze wandering the wavesnsearchingly. Kip shrugged once again, lazily, tired and bored, and said, \"Yeah,nbut I'm not sure I want a Cadillac, you know?\" \"Oh, man, you're not sure about anything,\" Tumbler complainednimpatiently, hearing the screeching of a car from not too far away. Henignored it. Some people in Long Beach drove like maniacs... himselfnincluded at times. \"I know I want a car,\" Kip retorted confidently, \"I just don't knownwhat kind.\" \"Or what colour, year, size... any of that,\" Tumbler told him simply,nwithout looking back at his friend. Tumbler heard a car pull up behind them, and only half-turned whennsomeone grabbed Kip around the scruff of his sweater. Tumbler went to help,nmet by a punch in the stomach that knocked the wind out of him. He and Kipnwere thrown forcefully inside a van, and he heard the door slam, and thennlooked up, finding a gun pointing at them. Tumbler immediately raised hisnhands, glancing to Kip in alarm. What the hell was going on? \"You Kip Raines?\" one man asked, a large dark-skinned man withnshadowy eyes and black hair. He was the one holding the gun. The man besidenhim had obviously bleached hair, and was staring intently, sitting on a lownseat, his arms rested forward on his knees. There were two men in the frontnof the van, but it was hard to pick them out. \"Yeah,\" Kip replied with a quick nod. \"What's this about? We didn'tndo anything.\" He looked to Tumbler, who kept quiet. The second man glanced at Tumbler, and smiled a wry smile at thencorner of his mouth. \"You'll find out.\" Their journey took no more than ten minutes, and before long, theynfound themselves being pushed out of the van outside of a large warehouse,npeople milling about here and there, watching them as they were directed tonthe front door. They stepped inside, the larger of the two men stillnpointing a gun on them. Tumbler looked to Kip, and saw that his friend had already noticednthe impressive -if somewhat small- collection of expensive cars dottednaround, spaced out here and there by the odd motorbike. They were led towards a metal staircase that wound up to a secondnfloor room with the kind of glass that let you look out from the inside,nbut was impenetrable to the naked eye from the exterior. The kind of glassnyou see in detective movies. Tumbler walked behind Kip, and in front of thenlight-haired man who had hit him back at the pier. The guy had one hell ofna right hook. When at the top of the staircase, the larger man opened the door, andnindicated that Kip and Tumbler go inside, which they did obediently,nneither too keen on the idea of getting shot. That hadn't worked out toonwell for Toby, even if he was fine now. It wasn't appealing. Once inside, the room was revealed as somewhat spartan, furnishednonly with a desk, three chairs and a coat rack, covered with an expensivencloth coat and a scarf. The scarf was collecting dust, but the coat wasnfresh and clean, and looked like the kind that cost an arm and a leg to getndry-cleaned. A middle-aged man sat behind the wooden desk in a leather chair thatnsqueaked slightly when he rocked in it. His hair was receding, and fleckednwith grey. His eyes were a dark menacing green, and bore through the twonyounger men almost instantaneously. He leaned forward on the desk, hisnelbows rested on the wood, and he smiled a cunning smile. He was dressednentirely in black. \"Kip Raines and Tumbler, I presume,\" the man said, and his voicencarried a hint of sarcasm and just a touch of menace. He glanced betweennthe two, and raised his eyebrows. Kip nodded. The man smiled, and stood from the desk, pacing around it, and takingnto glancing out of the window down at the warehouse below. \"My name is LylenShepherd.\" Tumbler held back the urge to speak, knowing he could be less thannsubtle with his insults, and that would probably earn him another punch orneven a bullet, neither of which he really wanted right now. He kept hisnmouth shut, and simply watched and listened. \"I've heard of you, in case you hadn't guessed,\" the man said with anslight laugh that carried across the room. \"I've heard about what you canndo.\" \"If you're referring to boosting cars,\" Kip began cautiously, \"then Inthink you mean 'used to do'. We don't do that anymore.\" He turned to them, hands in his pockets, and cocked his head ever sonslightly, narrowing his eyes. \"Is that right?\" Tumbler didn't even have time to react when the strong hand latchedntightly around his neck and threw him against the wall, locking around hisnthroat immediately after, the other hand of the light-haired man grippingnthe front of his shirt, pinning him. Kip went to help his friend, but stopped immediately when the gun wasnpointed at him. The man identified as Lyle Shepherd stared expectantly atnhim, and waited. Tumbler choked slightly, and gritted his teeth, trying to pry thenstrong hand off of his neck without success. He tried kicking out, strikingnthe man twice, finding nothing happened. The man didn't budge, simply heldnhim tightly, seemingly entertained. \"Let him go,\" Kip said calmly, his voice shaking nevertheless,nlooking pleadingly to Shepherd. He shifted nervously on his feet, andnglanced back over at Tumbler, who closed his eyes tight, and continuedntrying to pull the man off of him. Shepherd didn't speak, just stood silently, watching. \"Please,\" Kip attempted, taking a step towards Shepherd, \"we don'tnsteal cars anymore. We can't help you, whatever it is you want, you'renwrong. We don't boost now.\" \"You're living honest,\" Shepherd said blandly, glancing to the floor,nan expression of boredom on his face. \"Is that right?\" \"That's right,\" Kip confirmed, even as Tumbler choked again. \"Comenon, let him go.\" There was a long silence, where the only noise was that of the carsnoutside and the sounds of Tumbler struggling to get free and breathe. Kip stared pleadingly at Shepherd, and Shepherd stared right back atnKip. \"You're not living honest,\" Shepherd said to him, \"not anymore.\" \"W... what?\" Kip mumbled, not quite sure what he should say, ifnanything. He didn't really understand. He looked to his friend momentarily,nand then back to Shepherd. \"You work for me now,\" Shepherd continued, \"and you do what I say,nwhen I say.\" Kip shook his head. He had tried so hard to get out of the life henhad foolishly chosen some years back, and didn't want to revert to itnagain. He didn't want that for him and his friends. They were livingnhonestly, earning a living -if somewhat sparingly- and getting on fine.nUntil now, it seemed. \"If you don't work for me,\" Shepherd began, moving across the room tonstare out of the other window casually, standing right next to the man whonwas choking Tumbler, giving them a nonchalant glance, \"then he dies.\" Tumbler tried to protest, but couldn't form the words, fighting fornoxygen, and failing. Kip was falling into panic now, and trying his best to hide it.n\"Don't make me do this.\" \"What's it going to be, Mr. Raines?\" Shepherd queried, turning tonregard him, looking to the two men at the side of the wall. \"Your 'honest'nlife... or his survival?\" He indicated Tumbler with a nod of the head, andnraised his eyebrows. \"Your choice.\" Another prolonged silence, where Kip thought frantically over hisnoptions, his mind refusing to take in what was happening. \"You can live with boosting cars, Mr. Raines,\" Shepherd pushed, voicenlower, eyes staring at Tumbler now, watching the younger man struggle tonget free, \"but can you live with his death on your conscience?\" Kip shook his head vehemently, and then nodded twice. \"Okay, okay...nalright, I'll do whatever you want. Just let him go, okay?\" Shepherd smiled triumphantly, and patted the light-haired man on thenshoulder once. He instantly released Tumbler from the choking grip, and letnthe younger man collapse against the wall, gasping for air, before henslowly sank to the floor, coughing. Kip stayed where he was, not sure whatnmoving would provoke from the gun-wielding man behind him. \"Now,\" Shepherd eased, \"listen up. Here's what I want from you.\"[Chapter 5] The usual sounds of the garage carried through into the office,nthrough its open door and thin windows, and right to Otto Halliwell and hisnwife. The dog lay snoring on its side under a bench, and one of its fournlegs kicked every now and again in the frantic chase of a dream. Otto sat at the workbench, glasses perched on his nose as he skimmednsome recent paperwork, the radio playing in the background, but inaudiblenover the clanking of tools, the conversing and the revving of engines. With a groan, Otto pulled his glasses off his face and let them hangnaround his neck as he rubbed his tired eyes. He sighed, seeing theninquisitive look of his wife. Otto smiled. Junie smiled back. It was at that moment that Memphis appeared in the doorway, lookingnrather frustrated, maybe even a little concerned... perhaps angry. \"What's wrong?\" Junie asked, and the sound of her concerned voicenawoke the slumbering dog. It gazed about lazily and yawned. Memphis looked down at Otto. \"Hank just arrived. He said he saw Kipnand Tumbler downtown,\" he revealed. There was an unmistakable look in hisneyes. \"Are they okay?\" Otto found himself asking, turning on his stool tonface his friend. Memphis shrugged. \"Apparently, they were admiring a Lexus.\" Otto glanced briefly to Junie, stood, and led the way out of thenoffice, leaving his wife and dog behind. Memphis followed. \"Do you think they were... up to something?\" Memphis let out a long exaggerated breath, and shook his head. Swayncame up beside him as he replied, \"It's hard to tell. Kip's been clean fornover a year, but Hank said they looked a little... suspicious.\" His eyesnmet Sway's, and the woman's brow knitted. \"Well there's no way to tell what they're really doing,\" Sway stated,nusing a stray rag to wipe her grubby hands. Memphis raised his eyebrows. \"I can think of one.\" Otto nodded, and watched Memphis and Sway move off to change. * * * Tumbler watched Kip with a furrowed brow and a considerable frown. Hendidn't want this. It was wrong... Kip had tried so hard, as had he. Thentemptations had been unbearable at times, but he had beaten them... theynboth had. Kip stood next to a silver Lexus, admiring its sleek, beautiful formnand finish, touching it lightly with one hand. His eyes floated back to hisnfriend. Tumbler looked away, and shook his head slowly. He felt a littlenguilty, letting himself be used against Kip like he had. But he knew hownKip thought of him as family... close family. He would never let anythingnhurt Tumbler, and vice versa. It had been that way for years. Tumbler heard the rumble of a familiar car, and even as Kip managednto pop the door on the Lexus, his blue eyes caught sight of a ShelbynMustang approaching at a considerable speed. \"Um... Kip?\" Without looking back, removing his tool from the car door, Kip asked,n\"What is it? Is the owner comin' back?\" Tumbler shook his head, just as the Mustang pulled up on the oppositenside of the street. There was an unmistakable blonde in the passenger seat,nand an angry-looking man behind the wheel. \"No... but that might be better,\" Tumbler managed to stammer shortlynbefore the door of the silver Mustang opened. The man climbed out at once,nand started across the street. \"Kip!\" Tumbler swallow, throat suddenly dry, and saw his friend whirl innpanic as recognition set in regarding the owner of the voice. \"Memphis...\" he muttered, seemingly in disbelief, even as his brothernstalked swiftly up to him, and shoved the door of the Lexus closed rightnbehind Kip. Kip started slightly, and opened his mouth to explain. Memphis heldnup a hand. Tumbler felt the desperate urge to turn and walk away, seeknsanctuary, but Sway's glare kept him frozen in place. He avoided her angryngaze, and his eyes found an interesting non-existent point on the floor. \"Don't say a word, Kip,\" Memphis growled, and without looking fromnhis brother, addressed Tumbler; \"Where's your car?\" Tumbler fumbled for a moment, digging his keys out of his pocket.n\"Right around the corner,\" he mumbled in response. \"Sway. Go with Tumbler,\" Memphis said stiffly, \"drive him back tonOtto's.\" Sway nodded, and moved to Tumbler, who unclipped his keys and handednthem to her shamefully. He was more embarrassed that he could remembernbeing in a long time. The look Sway gave him didn't help any either. Shentook the keys, and walked beside Tumbler, keeping an eye on him. Just as they were about to round the corner, Tumbler heard Memphisnsay, \"Kip, get in the damn car.\" * * * The drive back to the shop didn't take long, and when Memphis pulledn'Eleanor' up outside, the red and black '67 Nova was already there, parkednand empty. Sway and Tumbler had beaten them here... quite surprising at thenspeed Memphis had driven. Memphis climbed out; waiting until he saw Kip get out as well, andnthen shut the car door. His brother did the same. Memphis led the way intonthe garage, his anger swelling more and more by the minute. This was morenthan a problem. This was unbelievable... he had thought Kip was over this,nTumbler too. Apparently not. Pushing his way through the door, Kip right behind him, Memphisncaught sight of Otto, who nodded to him. Junie was hanging back in thenoffice doorway. The shop was quiet. \"I had a feeling you'd head back here,\" Otto explained, his voicenlow, dog at his side, \"I sent the others home for the rest of the day.\" Memphis nodded, and let his eyes search for Sway, who he foundnleaning against the wall across the room, near to a desk, her arms crossednover her chest, face pensive. Tumbler sat with a frown in a wheelie chair,nwhich he shoved lightly back and forth with one foot. The chair spun a fewncentimetres and stopped, before he gave the ground another gentle nudge,nsending him spinning ever so slightly the other way. His arms were on thenrests at the side of the chair, and his eyes never left the floor. The air was silent for a while, the tension high. Everyone just satnand looked at everyone else, save for the two culprits who had just beenncaught red-handed, so to speak. The only sound was that of the dog as henpanted in the warm afternoon, eyes droopy and lazy. Memphis gave a momentary glare to Tumbler, and then turned on Kip,nwho looked to be expecting whatever his brother had in store. He lookednashamed, and for a very good reason. \"What the hell do you think you were doing?\" Memphis blurted finally,nno longer able to keep it inside, feeling his anger flow free throughoutnhis body. His eyes found Kip's and locked them there. Kip said nothing. Memphis glanced back at Tumbler, who avoided hisngaze, and also kept silent. Memphis paced one intimidating step closer to his brother, and saidnin a low voice, \"I asked you a question.\" \"We...\" Kip began quietly, somewhat feebly, \"we were...\" he sighed,nand shoved his hands in his pockets, \"we were stealing a car.\" At the sound of movement from behind him, Memphis turned his head tonsee Tumbler merely leaning forward in the chair, a hand rubbing through hisnhair. It was the sentence Memphis had feared. He had known it was coming,nbut something deep inside of him had told him foolishly that maybe therenwas another explanation. For a few moments, Memphis wasn't sure what to say or do, before henmanaged to ask, \"What the hell for? I thought you were done with that...ndidn't you learn your lesson the last time!\" Kip squirmed under his brother's icy glare, and shook his head,nstammering for a second before offering, \"You don't understand.\" \"You're damn right I don't,\" Memphis agreed whole-heartedly, lookingnto Sway, who shrugged. Tumbler had taken to standing from the chair, handsnin his pockets also, eyes locked on the classic Ford, obviously trying tonfind something else other than the debate to concentrate on. Memphis continued, \"Here I was thinking you had finally learned yournlesson, gotten over all of this, and moved on. You told me you were goingnto buy a car, not boost one. I mean... a Lexus? In broad daylight!\" \"No,\" Kip mumbled, shaking his head, \"it's not like that. I didn'tnhave any other choice...\" Memphis felt his brow furrow, and his eyes narrowed in confusion andnconsideration briefly, before he demanded, \"What are you talking about? Youncould have chosen not to steal the damn Lexus. You're lucky I got therenbefore you did something stupid and got yourself in more trouble than you'dnever know what to do with.\" Kip took his hands out of his pockets, and gestured vaguely to thendoor as he said, \"No, I mean, I didn't want to steal the Lexus-\" \"What? Someone told you to steal the car?\" Memphis exclaimed, wavingnhis arms, leaning forward to say it right in Kip's face. Kip wasn't intimidated anymore. Memphis waited for the excuse. \"I had to, Memphis,\" Kip told him firmly; words clear and crisp, eyesnlocked with his. \"I didn't have any other choice.\" Sway moved over a few feet, standing behind Memphis, and asked, \"Kip,nwhat are you talking about? What do you mean you 'had to'?\" Kip hesitated, and Memphis saw him glance to Tumbler, who was tryingnhis hardest not to get involved. If I'm not going to get anything out of him, Memphis thought,nregarding his brother momentarily, before stalking over to the Ford, thennmaybe I can find out what's going on from Tumbler. He arrived at Tumbler's side, and visibly saw the younger man shrinknaway slightly, as if he had thought Memphis was going to strike out atnhim... and it wasn't like Tumbler couldn't defend himself. What the hellnwas going on here? Something was wrong. \"Are you going to tell me what's going on?\" Memphis asked, keepingnhis eyes firmly locked on Tumbler. Tumbler threw a look to Kip, and said, \"Nothin'.\" Memphis almost burst out laughing at the pathetic attempt. There wasnno emotion in Tumbler's voice. He had just shaken his head and mumbled ansimple word, one that Memphis already knew meant squat. \"Don't lie to me,\" Memphis warned, and Tumbler looked him in the eye. The two stared at each other for what seemed like hours, but whatnwere only moments in reality, and their gaze was intense, daring even.nMemphis wanted to know what was going on, and Tumbler wasn't going to say. \"Did you put him up to it?\" Memphis inquired after a long minute, notnsurprised when he saw Tumbler snap his head to him in disgust and shock. Tumbler's gaze hardened, and he narrowed his eyes. \"Hell, no.\" \"Then what? Some dumbass dare?\" \"Yeah, right,\" Tumbler scoffed quietly, \"you think we're thatnstupid?\" \"I dunno,\" Memphis retorted quickly, \"I caught you breaking into anLexus in the middle of the street.\" \"You've got no idea what's goin' on,\" Tumbler practically growlednback, inches from Memphis now. He had clearly made him a little angry...ngood, just what he wanted. Maybe now he would get some answers. \"Then why don't you tell me?\" Memphis pondered aloud, sarcasmnevident. \"Because it's none of your damn business!\" Tumbler exclaimed, andnbefore long, he and Memphis were tangled up in a rather heated argumentnthat jumped back and forth. Their words increased in volume, and the intentnmoved from inquiry to insult quickly. Sway moved over to try and break Memphis away from it, and Otto wasntrying to calm Tumbler down. Apparently, it didn't take long for the youngnman's temper to boil. He was furious. Memphis wasn't much better. Junienstayed back in the office, rubbing her eyes, and the dog retreated throughnthe small doorway behind her with a low pine. \"He was going to kill him!\" At the sound of Kip's almighty shout, everyone froze, their voicesnfailing and stopping altogether. Memphis turned to his brother first,nfollowed by a confused Sway. Otto glanced between Kip and Tumbler, whonsighed loudly, and rubbed his hair again, glancing away, seemingly ashamednagain. Kip was staring intently to his brother, and he was breathing hard,nas if he had just been running. Memphis' eyes narrowed. \"What?\" Calmer, Kip repeated his words, \"He was going to kill him.\" \"Who?\" Sway inquired, tilting her head ever so slightly, with anfurrowed brow. Kip paused, and Tumbler's eyes darted to meet him. There was a subtlenshake of the head, one that Kip apparently chose to ignore. \"He... he said he was going to kill Tumbler,\" Kip managed after anmoment. \"That's why we... why I was stealing the Lexus.\" Memphis glanced to Tumbler, who groaned, rubbed his face, and slumpednback into the chair. He paced over to his brother, and took a hold of hisngently by the shoulders. \"Who said he was going to kill Tumbler? Why?\" \"Um... I... I can't remember,\" Kip murmured, shaking his head innserious confusion. Sway glanced to the other young man, and raised her eyebrows. Tumblernsaw her regarding him, and let out a sigh, saying, \"Lyle Shepherd. His namenwas Lyle Shepherd.\" Memphis whirled to Otto, and quickly said, \"Get hold of Atley, see ifnhe's heard of this Lyle Shepherd guy.\" Otto gave a swift single nod, and disappeared into the office atnonce. There was the sound of his picking up the phone. \"What did he want you to do?\" was Memphis' next question, and henturned back to his brother, anger faded, concern ebbing and flowing freely.nThe situation was more complicated than he had thought. \"He wanted me to get everyone together, and then he was gonna give mena list of cars he needs,\" Kip explained, and there was an edge ofnexhaustion to his voice. He scratched the back of his head slowly, andnsighed. \"I didn't want to get anybody else involved.\" \"Then how come you went after the Lexus if you didn't even have anlist?\" Sway queried, not sure who to look to: Kip or Tumbler. Tumbler chose to reply, and Kip perched himself on the edge of anworkbench carefully as the other young man said, \"We thought that if wencould show this guy we could manage to boost a car without anyone's help,nthen no one else would have to get involved.\" \"I know how much this all mean to you, Memphis,\" Kip added, glancingnaround the garage, \"and I didn't want you to have to risk losing it allnagain. I thought this was all behind us, you know?\" \"Then how did this Shepherd guy get the chance to offer you thendeal?\" Memphis asked, hands akimbo, eyes looking between Kip and Tumbler. Kip and Tumbler explained carefully, trying not to leave out a detailnof what they knew, and Memphis and Sway listened carefully. It was a littlenconfusing, and more than a little worrying. Someone had been able to dragnup information about the crew's names and skills. Someone had told them,nand they even had photos of every member of both young and old crews.nSomeone had been doing their homework. Memphis saw Otto emerge from the office, and heard him say, \"Atley'sngonna see what he can dig up on this Shepherd guy. He'll give us a callnwhen he finds something.\" Memphis nodded, mind made up, and turned full on to his old friendnand associate, saying, \"Otto, we've got some calls to make.\"[Chapter 6] Two hours had passed, seemingly in an endless drag, and Otto's largengarage had once again filled with familiar faces, young and old. Kip andnTumbler had tried to protest, but Memphis, Sway and Otto himself would hearnnothing of it. Someone needed their help, and whether they liked it or not,nthey were going to get it one way or another. Memphis paced the room thoughtfully, leather jacket still coveringnhis tall slim frame. His frosted blonde hair was neat and styled, hisnintelligent, gentle eyes ever watchful of the people around him. One handnrested near his mouth, as if in deep thought, the other on his hip firmly. Otto hovered in the doorway to his office, Junie gone home for thenrest of the day. The large lazy mastiff lounged sleepily at his heels,ndrooling generously. Otto's grubby overalls had been rolled up at thensleeves, and the rag hung limply from one pocket. He watched Memphisncarefully. Sway sat reversed in a spinning chair, leaning her chin on herncrossed arms patiently. Her blonde dreadlocks rested around her face and onnher lean feminine shoulders gracefully, light eyes looking around at thencollection of friends and colleagues, new and old. She felt safe to be innsuch familiar company. Donny Astricky had taken it upon himself to lean his large framenagainst the temperamental Ford, and his kind dark eyes admired itnknowingly. His large hands were in his pockets now as his eyes flittednabout to take in the small crowd. It had been a while in coming, but to himnit had been inevitable that they all reunite sooner or later. Sphinx, the large silent imposing figure that he was, held answitchblade firmly in one hand, proceeding to flick it out sporadically,npushing it down again with his free hand. His strong face looked as mean asnever, and the penetrating eyes never left the weapon. Kip slouched in a grubby armchair at the far side of the room, hairngelled back, eyes staring at a nonexistent point on the wall oppositenamidst tools and keys. He had been lost in his own little world for somentime now, and had not said much in almost fifteen minutes. Standing cocky as ever not too far from Sphinx, his dark sunglassesncovering his eyes, was Mirror Man, nodding away to his own silent beat innhis head. His bright, over-the-top clothing singled him out from everyonenaround him, and he seemed content to be so original and individual. Hovering in front of an active laptop, typing away frantically andneffortlessly was Toby. His blonde hair was wispy and somewhat tousled, asnif their phone call had woken him from a much-needed sleep after a longnnight of surfing the net. His innocent eyes never left the screen. Freb stood curiously, seemingly a little nervous, close to Otto,nglancing at everyone frequently in turn. He sighed restlessly often,nwaiting for the plan of action to be announced, made public knowledge as itnwere. His all-black trademark clothing almost made him unnoticeable. And finally, there was Tumbler, seated near Kip on a clearednworkbench, not sure what to do with himself, eager to get his all over andndone with as soon as possible. He didn't even want to be here, was muchnmore concerned with getting everyone else uninvolved. It struck him that itnwas his fault... all of this. It was because of him that Kip had agreed tonthis. His blonde hair, lighter at the tips, was dishevelled, but stillnspiky as always, gelled into place. His blue eyes were observant andnconcerned. His youthful face wore a frown. There was only one figure missing, and the reason for their ominousnsilence was because of this absence. They had contacted him, and were justnwaiting for his report on this threat. Lyle Shepherd... that was what Kipnand Tumbler had called him. As if on some sort of cue, Atley Jackson appeared in the doorway,nswinging the wooden door closed behind his lank frame, looking downndistractedly at a scribbled collection of notes on a crumbed piece ofnpaper. Memphis and everyone else along with him turned their headsncollectively towards Atley, and waited, just like they had been for thenlast hour or so. It had in truth only taken a short amount of time forneveryone else to arrive, but Memphis wanted to wait until Atley had arrivednuntil he got down to business. \"I think we got ourselves a problem,\" Atley said without provocation.nHis shaded eyes met those of Memphis, sway and Otto, and he sighed loudly.n\"One Lyle Shepherd,\" he continued, flashing the paper momentarily, \"is anconvicted convict, charged in the past decade for just about everythingnunder the sun. And I mean everything.\" Memphis waited... more waiting. Why was everything determined to makenhim wait recently? Atley's eyes scanned his paper as he read from it loudly, \"Theft,nattempted murder, assaulting a police officer, grand larceny, disturbingnthe peace, kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm.\" Tumbler frowned considerably, and Kip glanced up at him on thenworkbench from his slouched position in the armchair. Kip furrowed hisnbrow, and gave his friend a reassuring look. Atley had moved across the garage, through the small collection ofncar thieves, young and old, and handed Memphis the paper. Memphis let hisngentle eyes look it over, and groaned, rubbing his head once over, rufflingnhis light hair, before passing it to Sway. She let out a whistle, andndiscarded the paper, letting Otto take a glance. \"I think problem is an understatement,\" Otto commented quietly,nlaying the paper inside his office before Freb could take a look. Thenyoungster frowned, tried to peek, before Otto was forced to actually closenhis office door to prevent him from doing so. There was something on thatnpaper that they didn't want the young crew to see. Sphinx and Donny sat patiently on their respective sides of the room,neyeing the others curiously. They would get their look later, they knew.nThey knew how to be patient. Years of boosting cars had taught them suchnendurance. \"So what exactly is it that we're doin' here?\" Mirror Man askednbluntly after a moment of prolonged silence. He looked around through darknshades, and shrugged his lean shoulders, glancing hurriedly up at Sphinx.nThe large statue of a man simply blinked. \"We're waiting,\" Memphis replied, his eyes never meeting MirrornMan's. The young dark-skinned man waited, and then slumped his shouldersnback against the wall, taking his hint to shut up and sit tight. A few eyes darted momentarily in Tumbler's direction, and the youngnman tried his best not to notice, glancing to this and that as if he wasndistracted. Memphis knew he did realise the attention he was being paidnthough... he also knew Tumbler didn't like it. Memphis sighed lightly, and made his way for the exit at a calm pace,ntapping Sway on the shoulder as he went. She glanced up immediately, herneyes looking around once before she followed silently, a little meekly...nodd for her. Sway came to meet Memphis outside the door moments later, her blondenhair cascading in controlled tight locks over her feminine shoulder, herneyes curious. He had a purpose for calling her out here; she just didn'tnknow what it was. \"What is it?\" she asked quietly, careful not to let herself be heardninside the closed garage. She stood close to the taller figure of Memphis,nas if the proximity helped to calm her nerves. As Memphis touched her arm, she shuddered slightly. What had her sonspooked? It wasn't as if Shepherd had threatened her life. But Memphis knewnwhat it was almost as soon as he thought about it... it was the fact thatnsomeone she knew was being threatened so vehemently. Shepherd's record wasnimpressively frightening. \"I think we ought to consider getting Kip and Tumbler out of LongnBeach... Tumbler especially,\" Memphis informed her after a moment ofnserious consideration. It hadn't taken him long to come to the conclusion.nIt was the only sensible thing to do. But Sway shook her head almost instantly. Apparently she did notnagree. \"No,\" was all she said. \"Why not? If he stays, then we risk getting him killed.\" Memphis wasnbeing insistent but not harsh in his words. He chose them carefully, spokenthem cautiously. The last thing he wanted or needed was to offend the womannhe loved. \"What happens if Shepherd finds out we shipped him outta town, huh?nWhat do you think he'll do to the rest of us,\" Sway corrected firmly. \"Andnthen what's to stop him from tracking Tumbler down? Kip too if you sendnthem both away.\" Another strong shake of the head. \"They wouldn't be ablento live with themselves if that happened... I know I wouldn't.\" Memphis let the words sink in, and then embraced Sway tightly andnaffectionately. Sometimes she was so much smarter than him. She had a goodnhead on her shoulders. He kissed the top of her head, and then her lipsngently. He nodded. \"You're right,\" he whispered to her. Then he said louder, \"Allnright... everyone stays... if they want to.\" * * * Tumbler had taken it upon himself to slump himself down in the farncorner of the room, where it was quiet and distant from everyone else, andnjust think. He had been down here for a good ten minutes now, whilstneveryone else talked. Memphis and Sway were still outside speakingnsecretly. He didn't care what they were talking about. He just wanted everyonento leave... he wanted to go back to his apartment, lie on his bed, andnthink about how much of an idiot he was. All of his life, he had never letnanyone use him like that... never. His back was rested firmly against the wall behind him, his kneesndrawn up loosely in front of him and his elbows leaned on them. His handsndangled before his legs, and he spun one of his large rings round and roundnhis finger as if it would help him think. Not that there was much to thinknabout. This was his problem... well, technically -to Shepherd at least- hisnand Kip's. Nevertheless, he wanted Kip out of danger. He wanted to handlenthis himself. The door opened as his mind resolved itself, and his blue eyesnimmediately darted to meet the face of Memphis, followed by Sway, as he re-nentered the garage. There was a look of certainty on his own face, as henmotioned everyone to listen. \"I've been thinking,\" Memphis said loudly, drawing attention tonhimself, \"and I've decided that not everyone needs to be involved innthis... not if we're careful. With a little bit of deception, we can makenShepherd believe that everyone he wants involved is taking part. One carnhere and there if you're not willing, then there won't be any problems. Indon't want anyone to feel obliged to put themselves at risk.\" There was a moment of silence, and everyone looked at one another,nfleetingly at Tumbler, who sighed and glanced at the floor, trying not tonlook bothered. He tried to give off an air of nonchalance, and wasn't surenwhether or not he succeeded. \"So,\" Memphis continued purposely, \"who's in?\" ","Summary":" NOTE: As I am not much of a car person, names and types of American carsnwould be appreciated for f"},{"Movie":"Cabin in the Woods","Title":"It All Started With Apple Juice","Author":"NoLongerInUse404","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9955973","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Holy shit, you're joking\" \"What?\" \"We're out of apple juice\" \"Why the hell do you care about that?\" \"Because I really want apple juice\" \"Well go get some out of the store\" \"But it's too far\" \"Are you- You're fucking with me, aren't you?\" \"Not yet\" \"I- Wait what\" \"Hmm?\" \"What did you say?\" \"Hmm?\" \"What the ever living fuck did you say?\" \"I said nothing, kay?\" \"Oh the hell you didn't-\" \"Ow!

Well too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more. And every day, I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths. Colonel Carl Jenkins The Numbers Game Colonel Carl Jenkins didn't like looking at casualty reports. It put a face on his pawn pieces. Granted, the casualty report in the reception area of Fort Ares didn't have pictures attached to them, but still, it had names. Pawns didn't have names, and if they did, you were playing the game wrong. Still, the names were there. A constant reminder that on the other side of the galaxy, men and women were fighting and dying against a species that didn't have names even for its queens. When the chess analogy was used, he'd heard some people say that it didn't work, because the Arachnids had their kings, their queens, and a hell of a lot of pawns. Every human however might as well be a queen, in that they were self-aware. Whenever he'd heard the defence, Carl had just rolled his eyes – no, the analogy held. Being a self-aware pawn didn't stop you from being a pawn. High as he was in the Federation, he was still a bishop at best, and that didn't mean that he could choose to leave the board at a moment's notice. So the screen in the reception area showed the endless cycle of names. He kept reading the latest copy of The Daily Eagle – one of several state-run publications that had everything from the reports on the war, to the economy, to some celebrity's second baby that said celebrity promised would be raised as a good citizen of the Federation. Frowning as he skipped from page 6 to 27 (page 6 had asked whether he wanted to know more about the fighting on Beta II Sierra), he reflected that the paper was good at one thing – selling a version of the war that wasn't real. \"Colonel Jenkins?\" But then, what was real anyway? He was a psychic. Looking at the woman in front of him, he knew that the thoughts he was reading in her head weren't real, in as much that they didn't physically exist. But that didn't change the fact that the thoughts were still there. \"Is General Redwing ready?\" \"Yes sir, if you'll follow me.\" He nodded and he followed her out of the reception, past the grey-wearing pawns of Fort Ares that would be no different from pawns found on any other chessboard. He spared a glance at the casualty list nonetheless – pawns were dying left, right, and centre. It didn't take long for them to reach Redwing's office. The attendant knocked on the doors – wooden, as Carl noticed. They were the only things made of wood in the building. \"Come in,\" said the voice. Carl nodded at the assistant and did just that. Before him was a room bereft of anything that might suggest a personal connection with anyone, and everything that signalled love and devotion to the Federation – medals. Trophies. A pair of antique pistols mounted in a cross section on the wall above the Federation flag. Three walls of Redwing's office were taken up with such memorabilia, while the fourth was made from plasteel, allowing a clear view over the sands of Mars. Red, red, and more red – just like the blood-splattered grass of Beta II Sierra, only a different shade. \"Colonel Jenkins,\" Redwing said. She loosened the top of a crystal bottle and began pouring a clear liquid into a pair of cups. \"Drink?\" \"Um…\" \"It's just water Jenkins.\" \"Oh.\" He took a seat opposite her and took a sip. \"Thank you.\" Redwing smirked. \"You didn't know it was water? Thought a psychic would know that.\" \"It isn't that simple,\" Carl murmured. \"Fair enough.\" Redwing leant back in her chair and took a sip herself. \"Trust me Jenkins, I'd love to have a bottle of something fancy here, but water is basically liquid gold on Mars.\" She took another sip. \"Speaking of Mars, how are you finding it?\" \"Red. Dry. Dusty.\" \"I meant the gravity.\" \"Oh, that.\" Carl shrugged. \"I'm managing. I figure in less than forty-eight hours I'll be back on a ship with the gravity set to one g anyway.\" \"But not on Earth,\" Redwing said. \"I've got places to be. Earth isn't one of them.\" Redwing said nothing. She just took another sip. Carl didn't even try reading her mind, because if there was even the hint that he was trying to mind-read a superior officer, he would, at best, be looking at dishonourable discharge and with it, loss of any chance of citizenship. At worst…well, suffice to say, like the Arachnids, humans could find all manner of dealing death in unpleasant ways. \"So,\" Redwing said. \"I got your message – Planet P was a success. Everyone's happy. You aren't. And because you're so unhappy you want to come straight to the people who make decisions as to how the war will go.\" \"That's one way of putting it,\" Carl murmured. \"And I'm dealing with it in one way,\" Redwing said. \"What's the other?\" \"One's sending you straight to the sky marshal since you apparently know so much. Other is to tell you to remember your place and focus on the Bugs.\" \"I know my place. That's why I'm here.\" \"And why are you here?\" Redwing asked. Carl did a quick calculation in his head – three minutes, fifty-three seconds. Impressive. Most generals waited at least six minutes until they actually got down to business. \"I need money,\" he said. \"What?\" Carl cursed under his breath. \"What I mean is…I, I mean, we, need funding.\" \"Hmm.\" Redwing finished off her glass and began pouring another. \"Well, that's a bit more palatable. Though when you say we, is this Psychic Ops? Or you and some significant other?\" \"Yes. I mean…\" He sighed. \"We, as in, branches of intelligence and RnD.\" \"I wasn't aware that you were experiencing shortages in funding.\" She took a sip, put the glass aside, and leant forward. \"In fact, if you weren't receiving funding, would you have had the resources to capture the brain bug?\" \"We didn't capture the brain bug, the Mobile Infantry did. In fact, I met the private who did it,\" Carl said. \"And?\" \"And if the universe decides we get to live, then history will record our names sooner than his. And especially before the thousands who died in the operation.\" \"Are you going soft on me colonel?\" \"No ma'am. Just running the numbers.\" Redwing scoffed. \"You think the people in intelligence haven't already run them? The Arachnids have more. We kill more of them than they kill us. It balances out.\" \"Actually, it doesn't,\" Carl said. Redwing remained silent. \"Your entire strategy is based on the assumption that people keep enlisting at the same rate,\" Carl said. \"Let me tell you, that isn't going to happen.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I don't need to be a psychic to know that in almost every major war in human history, the rate of enlistment declines over time. Before the birth of the Federation, why do you think conscription was a thing?\" \"If you're suggesting the Federation introduces conscription colonel, you're going to find yourself on a planet far more backwater than Mars.\" \"Only a planet? Thought I'd be booted down to moon-level duty for that.\" He sipped his water and poured himself some more. \"No. I'm not suggesting conscription. The Federation's operated the way it has for centuries. The Federal Council isn't going to change that even in the face of our own extinction. Because as we all know, humans are terrible at changing their behaviour even when faced with calamity.\" Redwing didn't say anything. \"You're a general, aren't you? Weren't you obliged to study history?\" \"Everyone is obliged to study history Jenkins.\" \"Yes, I know.\" He leant back in his chair, thinking that lessons in history were often less about history, and more \"the present is awesome, the past was terrible, here's why.\" He could accept that no view on history could ever be neutral. He could accept that in the 21st century, that Western democracies had collapsed for a reason, and that the world the Federation created was at least a stable one. But then, that was before first contact with the Arachnids was made. Before the entire galactic paradigm shifted from humanity being the top god to a cat hissing at an approaching wolf. \"Fine,\" Carl said. \"I'm not suggesting conscription. But I am suggesting, or rather, requesting, that you pull some strings and allocate more of the budget to the branches I've nominated.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a data chip. \"Details are on there.\" \"Didn't know you were an economist Jenkins.\" Redwing nevertheless took the chip in her hands. \"I'm not, but I'm a strategist and a psychic. I can tell you, a decade from now, the Federation's going to be facing a shortfall in enlistment. Possibly even civil agitators in the colonies, even Earth itself. So, only way to avoid that is to win. And only way to win is to fight smarter. Accelerate developments. Change tactics.\" \"We're already doing that Jenkins.\" \"I…\" He sighed. \"General, do you know why Earth's been able to control its colonies up to this point?\" \"I wasn't aware that there was ever a point where that was an issue.\" \"It's because Earth has billions of potential soldiers, and millions of actual soldiers. Any world decides to rebel, we can overwhelm them through sheer weight of numbers.\" He paused, leaning back in the chair. \"How's that working against the Arachnids?\" \"So far? Well enough.\" Carl sighed. \"Look at the casualty list in this very base general. Do that, and tell me we're doing well enough .\" Redwing didn't say anything. Carl didn't need to read her mind to know that she had looked at it, and at least part of her was bothered by it. Silence lingered between the two of them, which allowed the colonel to consider his next words. He considered expounding on the values of exoskeletons, or even better, power armour, but decided against it. He didn't need to explain the worth of such nascent technology to Redwing, he just needed to get her to put more emphasis on it. \"Insects,\" he said eventually. \"Right now they're our enemies, but we don't really consider that they're also our allies.\" He decided to go for the metaphor. \"What the hell you on about Jenkins?\" A metaphor that needed explaining. \"Fun fact general – did you know that without even trying, our ancestors managed to wipe out one third of all insect species over the twenty-first century?\" \"No. Should I care?\" \"Well, obviously that was centuries ago, but if you'd been alive at the time, you might have cared,\" Carl said. \"History emphasises the birth of the Federation as the result of the collapse of archaic government, but we don't really consider the circumstances that led up to that. No insects, no crops, no food. No food, more wars, more death, more instability.\" He took a sip of water. \"Earth's better now though – more stable, better managed, but a lot of it is looking like…well, that.\" He nodded past Redwing towards the sands of Mars. \"Is this going anywhere?\" \"Insects bounced back though. They breed so fast, they can refill their ecological niche pretty quickly.\" Redwing snorted. \"You think the Arachnids have a niche that needs filling?\" \"No. But I do think that history has shown us that we humans are pretty good at killing things when it's the result of more than swatting and shooting. I mean, we nearly wiped out malaria in the twentieth century through killing mosquitos. That was through a single chemical, not swatting them.\" \"Malaria's still on Earth Jenkins.\" \"It is, but it's a non-issue. Which is our end-game with the Arachnids, no matter what the sky marshal says.\" Redwing raised an eyebrow. \"Are you suggesting-\" \"That we can't kill all of them? No, I'm not suggesting that, I'm stating that. We don't need to kill all of them, we just need to kill enough that they're no longer a threat. Same as most wars really – few powers have ever fought to the absolute end before they surrendered. And no bug species was ever wiped out by us just stomping on them.\" Redwing said nothing. She just lay back in her chair, running her finger around the edge of the glass. \"Course we know most of our chemical weapons are useless against the Arachnids,\" Carl said. \"But I'd like to think my point stands – fight smarter, not harder. Otherwise we may be looking at our extinction again, and this time, we may not survive it.\" He got to his feet. \"If I may…?\" \"Go,\" Redwing nodded. \"We'll be in touch.\" He gave a salute. \"Thank you ma'am.\" Walking out of Redwing's office, he reflected that \"we'll be in touch\" translated to \"we'll never talk again\" about half of the time. Still, he could live in hope. Humanity was simultaneously the most intelligent species in the galaxy, and also the dumbest. All of human history could be boiled down to intelligence and stupidity being at war with each other, with intelligence coming in to save the day at the last moment. It was a system that had worked so far, but intelligence only had to fail once before stupidity led to destruction. Looking at the sands of Mars, at the casualty list that kept working its way upward, he reflected that once again, destruction was at mankind's doorstep. A/N So, fun little fact, the number of insects on Earth is declining by about 2.5% per year, leaving some to suggest that by 2100, there'll be no insects left on Earth. I doubt it'll come to that, but whatever the case, if insect populations collapse, we are absolutely fucked. It was actually this tidbit that got me to write this, the idea that \"bug species\" are often antagonists in sci-fi (a trope that the original Starship Troopers at least popularized), but in reality, insects are absolutely vital to life on Earth. While writing this, I realized that Starship Troopers isn't really a setting condusive to expressing this idea since in-universe, the collapse of civilization before the Federation is attributed to \"the failure of democracy,\" but, well, drabbled it up anyway.

John Rico sat quietly in the medical bay maintaining his bedside vigil. It had been a week since the incident on planet P that had taken the lives of a number of his unit including Lt. Rasczak. It was the same incident that had nearly taken the woman he was now watching over. Dizzy had spent the first couple of days in the rehab tank in the medical wing having her wounds treated and mended with skin grafts. Once her wounds had been dealt with she had been moved to her current private room while she rested. So far she had remained unconscious the entire time which, the doctors had told Rico, was not uncommon after suffering so many traumatic injuries. The roughnecks had been granted a week of R&R; while the great minds at Military Intelligence were busy coming up with a mission plan for their return trip to planet P in an attempt to capture the so called \"brain bug\". Over the course of the week Rico had only left med bay to oversee Lt. Rasczak's funeral and to attend his own official promotion ceremony naming him the new Lt. in charge of the Roughnecks. Johnny looked down at her sleeping form once more thankful that she seemed to be resting comfortably. He remembered how beat up she'd been when he'd gotten her onto the rescue drop shift, at the time, being so sure she was going to die in his arms. Rico shuddered as memories of those terrible moments replayed in his mind. \"Rico! You know what to do!\" Rasczak barked as he looked up from where his now missing legs should have been. Rico hesitated for a moment before glancing at Dizzy and then back at the Lieutenant. After a split second he raised his Morita and fired a single round at near point blank into the Lt's chest. \"Watkins secure the lieutenant! We're not leaving him on this damn rock!\" Rico shouted to his nearby squad leader. Rico and Dizzy hoisted Rasczak's body onto Watkin's shoulder and the three headed for the rescue ship just as the floor where they'd just been standing was destroyed with the arrival of another of the tanker bugs. Rico watched as without hesitation, Dizzy threw one of her hand-grenades landing a perfect throw into the bug's mouth resulting a moment later in its head exploding. The attack on Dizzy by the arachnid soldier played out in what felt like slow motion. Rico watched helplessly as the bug stabbed through her body armor repeatedly. With Ace's help, Johnny had been able to rescue Dizzy and get her onboard the drop ship. It had been in the moments following their lift off that Rico had come to realize how much he truly cared for his classmate, friend, and now fellow squad-mate. For as much as he'd thought he'd cared about Carmen and would never be able to get past her, Dizzy had proved to him that the temporary pain had been just that. He had found someone that he knew would always be there for him no matter what for as long as they both lived. \"Johnny is that you?\" a strained voice brought him out of his thoughts. \"Yeah Diz I'm here.\" He replied softy taking her hand gently in his. \"Where are we? What happened?\" she replied still obviously groggy. \"Shh. Take it easy Diz. You're safe now. We're back at Ticonderoga, you've been out for a few days recovering.\" He replied as soothingly as he could. Rico spent the next few moments bringing her up to speed on what had happened following their evacuation from the outpost. Dizzy lay quietly in her bed holding his hand as she listen to the events that she'd missed. \"So how do you feel?\" he asked. \"Still tired and a little sore.\" She replied. \"Well try and get some more rest. I'll be here when you wake up I promise.\" He replied softly. Dizzy had trouble finding the words to express her gratitude for that promise so, she settled for simply smiling back at him. \"By the way I've been meaning to tell you something. I love you too Diz.\" Rico said as he gently kissed her forehead. Dizzy could feel the tears forming as she thought back to her confession that night in his tent. It was the first time they'd ever been together and the memory of having finally confessed her true feeling to him and the two making love had brought all those emotions flooding back. \"What's wrong Diz?\" he asked seeing the tears running down her cheeks. \"It's just that I've waited a long time to hear you say that. I still can't believe I finally get to be the one to have you.\" She replied voice a little shaky. \"You'll always have me Diz. I promise.\" He replied kissing her again. \"Now get some more rest. I promise I'll be here.\" He added. After watching over her for a few moments as she drifted back to sleep, Rico lay back in his chair thinking about all that had happened to them since graduation. Despite all the pain and tragedy and the fact that they'd had to grow up so fast he wouldn't trade the current moment for anything. His last thought before drifting off into his own peaceful sleep was that for the first time since he lost his parents to the tragedy in Buenos Aires and Carmen's love to the hands of fate, he was finally at a point of being truly happy. I love you Dizzy Flores and you will always have me he thought to himself yet again. And in that moment he knew that it was a promise he would die to keep.

No, it's not the fact that we're invading at all without bombing the planet first. It's not that the bugs are firing plasma far faster and cohesively than they should. It…well, actually, that does kind of bug me. Especially since I'm sure we've already lost one of the dropships as a result of this. And even if we don't bomb the planet from orbit, can't we send some fighter-bombers to soften up the targets that clearly do exist? Anyone? Okay. Just asking. So, we land. Pouring out from the dropships. I'm too busy charging and screaming like a maniac to ask anyone why we haven't deployed any armour. I mean, Arachnids are man-killers, right? Claws, claws, and more claws? I know a tank isn't invincible, and I know we don't ask walkers (yet), and I know that we don't have power armour (thought we had that though…someone wrote about it in a book…), but seriously, are tanks too much to ask for? Or, I know, flamethrowers! Anyone? Okay then. So, the invasion goes downhill pretty quickly. Yeah, we take out the plasma bugs, which are obviously not firing in coordination, and obviously aren't targets that we should have softened up beforehand, and obviously aren't causing a panic in the Fleet, and…well, you get my point. And points…ugh. Shouldn't have brought that up, because those Arachnid claws I mentioned? They're, well, pointy. So it isn't long before the bugs that obviously can't operate cohesively, that obviously can't use plasma batteries or lob asteroids across the galaxy to hit Earth (shouldn't those asteroids take billions of years to reach us?), and obviously aren't intelligent at all, are killing us. Bummer. It's quite a relief when I get to relay a call from the Fleet – time to bug out (geddit it? Bug?) and retreat. By which I mean running for our lives. And it's at that point that what bugs me, really bugs me. Why do we call them Arachnids? I mean, they walk on four legs don't they?

Bit of a headscratcher for me, and I've seen a few theories floating around. Anyway, drabbled this up as a take on it. Ghosts of Mars \"You're not real.\" She…it…he couldn't tell, ran her fingers along his shoulder. He couldn't feel her touch, such was the thickness of his armour, but still, he shivered. \"I'm not real?\" she whispered. \"I'm here, aren't I?\" No. You're not. You can't be. You can't be here, because your body was shot into space twenty years ago. But she was. Isabel \"Dizzy\" Flores. Mobile Infantry, Private, Roughnecks. Dressed in nothing but a vest and jeans, bereft of weapons or any armour. If she were real, she'd be twenty years older, not to mention having red rather than blonde hair. \"Remember, Johnny?\" she whispered, her two eyes locking in on his single good one. \"Remember that night we shared? That last night, across the stars and under them?\" Her fingers ran down his arm, and down the side of his check. \"Remember?\" He shoved her away and walked across the Martian sands. If he accepted that the universe was more insane than he'd realized, he could accept that Dizzy Flores hadn't been killed on Planet P, or God (who now existed according to the Federation) had done a Lazarus on him, and given him his friend slash lover back in the all too perfect flesh. But he couldn't accept that. Because whoever…whatever, this Dizzy was, there was one thing that he couldn't accept. \"Something wrong, Tiger?\" Her personality. It was all wrong. It was as if someone, or something, had taken the template of the perfect human female, under the premise that the average human male would only be interested in physique, and a personality that would be receptive to using that physique to create more humans. Dizzy Flores wasn't perfect. She never had been. \"Go to Hell.\" And he'd never asked her to be. So on he trudged over the sands of Mars. He, John D. \"Johnny\" Rico. Former hero of the Federation, former head of a satellite station in orbit of Mars, now assigned to a Mobile Infantry unit to take back the planet from the Arachnids. Specifically a unit that he was now separated from due to a FUBAR atmospheric insertion. He had a gun, ammo for it, and power armour as advanced as anything in human-controlled space. Yet all he could do was trudge with Dizzy Flores behind him. \"Johnny, what's wrong?\" He shook his head and kept walking. He'd landed on Mars, and there she was, right in front of him, no worse for wear for someone who'd been impaled by a Warrior Bug. \"Johnny, get your head out of your arse.\" He walked even faster – that was something the real Dizzy Flores would have said. The Dizzy Flores who- \"Johnny!\" He spun round and pulled a pistol on her. Pistols were next to useless against Bugs, and there were few situations when one needed to use them on a fellow human. But, there were always exceptions. Such as now. Such as drawing a pistol on a girl who didn't look a year over twenty, who was just standing there on Mars. \"Listen to me,\" Johnny said. \"There's only three ways you could be here now, and I don't have the time to indulge in them. So, either you disappear, or I waste a bullet and make you disappear.\" \"You'd kill me?\" she whispered. Scowling, he holstered the pistol, and began walking again. Scowling, he heard her walk after him. Alright, fine. \"One,\" he called out. \"You're some kind of human-Bug hybrid that the Arachnids have created in some pathetic attempt to infiltrate the Federation.\" He spun his head round. \"Newsflash Dizzy! You're not meant to impersonate people who are dead.\" Dizzy laughed. A perfectly normal sounding laugh that nonetheless sent a chill down his spine. \"Alright then,\" she said. \"What's the second option?\" \"Second option?\" He picked up the pace, this time keeping his eye on the straight and narrow, if such a thing existed in the Martian sands. \"There's a Brain Bug nearby that's doing some psychic mind trick. That it's trying to distract me, or get me to do an Anoke, or whatever it was you freaks think are going to break me.\" He sighed. \"Well, newsflash. I don't know jack, and if you want me to talk, you're going to have to stick your stinger in my head before I shove it up your arse.\" \"Don't think the Bugs have arses. Remember high school biology lessons?\" Dizzy laughed. \"Poor Carmen. She could never stomach what we could.\" Johnny paused. Carmen. She…it…whatever, had mentioned Carmen. Carmen, who was likely on the other side of the galaxy right now, taking part in an invasion of Klendathu that was anything but secret. Carmen, who he hadn't seen in years. And the Bugs knew that. Unless… \"So then,\" Dizzy said. \"What's the third option?\" \"The third option?\" He murmured. He took out his pistol and ran it through his fingers, sitting down on a small rock that looked like every other small rock on a planet that, compared to Earth, was nothing but a small rock. A rock that supported his weight as he met the creature's eyes again. Eyes that matched those of the real Dizzy Flores perfectly. If it was a trick from the Bugs, why was it that the eyes were what they got right? \"Option three…\" he began, \"is that I'm simply insane.\" \"That's it?\" \"That's it. Whacko. Section eight. Unfit for duty.\" \"I don't think you're unfit for duty.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm still talking to you aren't I?\" \"And why is that?\" Why indeed. He didn't know. He could guess, and generate his own set of options, but the first one that came to mind gave him so much pause that he dared not even contemplate darker alternatives. \"Johnny?\" He evaded her gaze and cast his own over the Martian sands, shivering in the wind. Mars was a cold world. Humans could live on its surface thanks to terraforming, but that didn't change the fact that Mars was still colder than Earth – it was simply too far away from the sun to exceed twenty Celsius bar the equatorial regions. Still, he had to admit, Mars had a beauty to it that the wasteland worlds of the Arachnids lacked. It was…primal, he supposed. The planet named after the Roman god of war, the planet that had enraptured mankind even before they reached into space, before the collapse of Western democracy and the birth of the Federation. Mars wasn't Earth, but right now, it was a close second. \"Twenty years,\" he murmured. \"Huh?\" \"Twenty years,\" he repeated. \"That's how long I've been doing this Dizz. How long since you died.\" \"But I'm here.\" \"No you're not. You're here, because I'm so old and so desperate that trapped on this shithole, I've conjured up some dream girl, because of my three closest friends in this world, one's dead, the other could be dead, and Carl…Christ, I can't even begin to guess where he is, or what he's doing.\" He stood up. \"So, yeah. That's why I'm talking to you. Because I'm so old and so desperate that I'm talking to a hallucination that may or may not be from the Bugs.\" He tapped his forehead with his pistol. \"Well, congratulations you overgrown insects – humans are insane. It's why we're so good at killing you.\" Dizzy, or whatever she was, just stood there. She put a finger to her chin, in a move that was meant to be seductive. Johnny holstered his pistol. He'd wasted enough time with this. If he was going to die on this planet (and chances were that he would), he could do it while not in a prepubescent wet dream. \"Twenty years,\" she said. \"So you'd be thirty-eight?\" \"In a few months, yeah.\" \"Hmm.\" She smiled. \"You don't look that old. In fact…\" She drew towards him, putting one of her arms around his, and the other… He tore away and kept walking. Across the Martian sands. Headed for the LZ in the hope that his unit had survived, and were more sane than he was. \"Johnny, come on! All's fair in love and war! And football! Hey, remember that move you used to pull? Can you still do it?\" Walked as fast as he could.

The last time I had glanced at the clock on the wall, it had been 4835L. I was determined to last at least five minutes before looking again. My record that night was eight minutes. My all time record was twenty. I thought that I might be losing a little more sanity every night I was the radio operator for Rico's Roughnecks. Klendathu. Bloodiest planet in the known universe. Tens of millions valid targets scurrying about. Daily skirmishes numbering in the hundreds across the battlespace. And there was nothing going on at nights on our area of operations. Nothing at all . \"Roughneck base, Roughneck base, this is Roughneck 2-6 romeo, radio check.\" Alright, I lied. There's radio checks. Wheeeeee... My callsign was Roughneck base. Roughneck 2-6 romeo was the radio operator for 2nd squad's sergeant. He wanted to make sure our radios were working. That's as exciting as things get around here. Man, day shift gets to call in airstrikes, and coordinate attacks and hot extracts, and all the cool stuff. I have to do radio checks. Without letting my eyes cross the clock's face, I swept up the receiver and jammed it up against my mouth. \"2-6 romeo, base, roger.\" \"Roger out.\" My eyes went to the clock against my will. 4844L. Nine minutes. Not bad. I stuck my hand in my utility pouch strapped to my leg and scooped some CaffJump pills out. Those little red pills could keep a man awake for over 80 hours if he takes enough of them. Before the Bug War, they were used as a study aid by students and to interrogate political prisoners. Lethal overdose is said to be impossible, though you certainly won't enjoy the experiment. I would literally shoot my own brother for a book to read. \"Roughneck base, Roughneck 6 alpha, radio check.\" Lt. Rico himself, out in sector, waiting for an attack that will never happen on my watch. But if it does, we'll have comms with him. \"Roughneck 6 alpha, Roughneck base, roger.\" I checked the time again. 4846L. About sixteen hours before my shift is up, because each day on Klendathu is about fifty earth-hours long- I'm on from 3830L till 1230L, daily. Why did I join the MI, again? Bing! Update sound. I checked the Transnet, where every unit within a thousand klicks shares the same message board. It's where I post any patrol updates and significant acts and so on. So does everyone else online. So it's a handy little tool for keeping everybody up to dat and on the bounce. [[Razorback_RTO]]: Two kawas traveling at unusually high speed, ivo GRID 23L XZ 9888 6625 I checked the map automatically. XZ 9888 6625 is on a game trail about twenty klicks to my west. Then I did a double take and reread the message. Kawas? They're flightless birds about a meter high. Totally harmless, unless you're a fruit or vegetable. Why on earth would he put that up on Transnet...? I pulled out the Battalion sigacts sheet and scanned it. No mention of kawas. I had thought maybe the Bugs were like, I don't know, using the kawas as living breeding factories, or as proxy psychic scouts, or something. No theory I could come up with was dumber than having them mentioned on the Transnet. I glanced at the clock. 4854L. I shrugged and resumed my drug fueled vigil. Bing! [[Razorback_Battle_NCO]]: STAND EASY MEN KAWAS HAVE LEFT GAME TRAIL HEADED SW OUT OF AO WE SALUTE YOU FOR FOR YOUR COURAGE IN FACE OF KAWA THREAT I blinked. What the heck...? My mind put the pieces together. The battalion RTO pulled a stupid, reported something pointless and unnecessary. The Sergeant Major chewed him out, then mocked him on Transnet so that everyone else would know that it wasn't something to worry about. I pulled out the keyboard and typed; [[Roughnecks_RTO]]: THANK GOD, WE'RE SAVED I giggled wildly to myself. I had been awake just a little too long, and slaphappiness was kicking in. Bing! [[Jaguars_Battle_NCO]]: WE HAVE OUR MORTARS LAID IN THAT DIRECTION, WE'LL KEEP THEM THERE JUST IN CASE And an instant later; Bing! [[Buenes_Aires_Airfield_RTO]]: We can have birds on station in five minutes if kawas make another pass. I laughed aloud, losing my composure a little. Razorback RTO was never going to live this down. Bing! [[Jaguars_Battle NCO]]: ROGER LOL I typed; [[Roughnecks_RTO]]: THOSE CUNNING KAWAS HAVE CLEARLY LEARNED OUR AOs, AND THEYRE USING THEM TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. DO WE KNOW IF THEY'VE ALLIED WITH THE BUGS? ? ? I popped another two CaffJumps and printed a quick snapshot of the screen. Lt. Rico was going to love this. Bing! [[MI_Intel_COIC]]: Those are definitely bugkawas, I've seen the video and it's obvious from the way they waddled I laughed. I roared. I fell out of my darn chair and rolled around, unable to breathe, pounding the ground with a gloved fist, rubbing my forehead against the floor. CaffJumps also remove inhibitions with enough doses, and I'd had quite a few. \"Roughneck base, Roughneck base, Tower One, radio check.\" \"Tower One, base, roger.\" I had recovered by now. I glanced up at the clock and saw that it was 0017L. One hour, twenty three minutes. New all time record, for the win. I got up out of the RTO chair and carefully pinned the entire Transnet conversation on the wall, where everyone who entered the HQ would see it. I stretched, popped another little red pill, and settled back down in front of the computer screens and radios. About twelve hours till shift change. A month and a half before I'm switched out to the front lines and see some actual action. One year before we redeploy back home. It was comforting to know that other MI are out there on night shift getting slaphappy too. ","Summary":" I stared at the computer screen, chin leaning heavy on my right fist.

He'd seen no nativenlife apart from Arachnids or sources of water. Not to say that theynweren't there, but the mission briefing hadn't covered suchnthings. All he and the rest of the Mobile Infantry were meant to donwas touch down, kill every bug in sight and establish a position,nenjoying a few cold ones in the aftermath.

Henknew where the bug was, specifically a few feet away from him, but itnwas dead, killed by MIs that could stop running away long enough tonkill it, but not long enough to help him back to the dropship.

However, for the grunts at the front line, right in the thick of it this war was personal. They did not fight for the future of you or me, they fought for each other. This story is dedicated to them. This story is also dedicated to my wonderful friends, Randal, Mike, Zaire, Breanna, Wiseman, Brittany Reed, and 1st Sgt's Vaughan and McKenzie. Chapter 1: history (past, present, future) I was just 18 when I joined up. We had been at war with the muldines for two years and all my friends had joined up. Some were infantry, others were doctors or pilots. No matter what, everybody did there part. When I graduated, I began to ask myself if I should do the same. I talked to my parents and after a long debate we had come to a decision. The next day I joined the drop-ship infantry. Chapter 2: don't forget I climbed off the transport and was \"greeted\" with the pleasant smirk of a smug drill sergeant. There was a holo-gram board that told your name and your placement. I was in 1st platoon, 44th brigade. I reported to my barracks after receiving a uniform. I won't go into to much about training. All you need to know is that it was no easy task and was extremely tough. After basic training, I went on leave for a few weeks. I stayed with my friend Elijah and after two weeks I got a letter, it read: Private Frank ray, You are hereby ordered to report to the federal cruiser Lansdowne. You are also promoted to the rank of corporal. I don't think I have to say anything else. Chapter 3: strong but sensitive Before I go into any further details about my experiences, I should state that in the galactic union both men can women are allowed to serve in the military, and while they are allowed to have relationships with civilians, it is against the rules for an officer or enlisted man to date with another soldier. My first few days on board the Lansdowne were pretty easy. Everyone was new so no one knew what to do (including me). My squad consisted of 4 other kids. Ghost was pretty quite but he looks like someone I could trust. MJ was a cool kid but not the kind of guy I would trust around my sister, Zaire was pretty laid back, he just wanted to stay out of jail. Then there was Little Bit, she just joined up to follow her father's footsteps, he fought in the last war. I was amazed, for a soldier so tough; she looked like she couldn't hurt a fly. She was cool but she seemed to have a bit of a temper. As night winded down a call came through, an aid station down on the planet surface required support and needed to evacuate the wounded. We answered that call. Chapter 4: baptism by fire As the transport hit the surface, we piled out carrying heavy weapons for tank battles. Bullets hit the ground around us. Two guys from B Company went down instantly. We ran for cover a couple of times before getting to the aid station. Ghost laid down some suppressing fire while Little Bit and I helped load wounded onto MJ's transport. We made it back but we lost a lot of people. As we docked with the cruiser we were for the most part, in a daze. We couldn't believe what had happened. We did everything by the book and still lost a lot of men. I looked over and saw Ghost staring out the window, I tapped him and he jumped but said nothing. We got off and went to our quarters. We were given a week of R&R; afterwards. Chapter 5: back in the saddle. When we got back from R&R; we had a bunch of new crewmembers. One of them was a chemist named Brittany; she was a nice girl but seemed kind of weird. To be honest I was kind of attracted to her even before I got to know her. We sat down at breakfast one day and started talking. Ghost walked by and gave me an odd look. Brittany then told me that ghost was her brother. Ever since our first mission, ghost has been acting really weird. He had a blank look on his face most of the time, but who could blame him. I guest, when you see a man get blown up, you tend to loose a bit of sanity. On this ship we have to act crazy just to keep from going insane. Even though technically we were on active duty, we still had fun. When little bits birthday came around, we threw a big party. I met her boyfriend at the party he was a nice guy, but I told him that if he ever did anything to hurt her than I would jettison him into the sun, after all in our band of brothers, little bit was the kid sister. We got a call later that night; a unit was under heavy fire and needed help getting there wounded out. Why does it seem like we get all the tough assignments? Chapter 6: Our great crusade It wasn't like our last landing. They knew we were coming. Anti-aircraft rockets exploded around us. As we touched down artillery hit the ground around us. I jumped behind a wall of dirt just as a mortar round hit. I caught a bit of shrapnel. Little bit picked up a field dressing and patched up my arm. I nodded and she left. I didn't see her for the rest of the battle. When we got to the downed units position I walked into the medical tent and saw little it lying on a bedroll with stitches in her leg. When she was finished, we reported to the commanding officers tent. The C.O. was a man named Lt. Vaughan. He told me his situation; they lost 4 men and had a critically wounded pilot. They needed help breaching the enemy road blocks. We contacted the ship; we would try an evacuation tomorrow. Chapter 7: Yankee Doodle Dandy As we moved from cover to cover I feared that the groans of our wounded pilot would give us away any minute. Then like something out of an old western, muldine infantry fired on us from a roadblock. One of our men had a machine gun and strafed the enemy. We ran behind a wall and I checked our TAC map. We reached the landing zone. We threw signal flares out as a beacon to signal the landing craft. When we arrived back at the flagship we were met by Capt. McKenzie, our C.O. he informed me that I was to be promoted to Drop Sgt. As part of this promotion I would be transferred to another unit for a month. Little bit was promoted to corporal. Chapter 8: Friends old and new I was sent to the 18th brigade to assume the position of Drop Sergeant, assuming that I completed this month of relocation; I will go back to the field to command and actual company as 2nd lieutenant. The 18th was just a training brigade that trained drop troops for the 44th brigade. Drop troops were the elite; they were sort-of like the long gone heroes of the air cavalry back in Vietnam. As I walked into the barracks which could be entered by either male or female sergeants, I was highly disappointed by the condition of the barracks, there was a television on and no one bothered to call the troops to attention, I quickly found the Private first class in charge of the men and relieved him of command as my first order of business I ordered two military police officers to smash the television. Not everything was bad about my time with the 18th brigade. I do happen to remember one soldier whom I trained with back in basic. Cadet Pvt. Garvin was a short soldier training to be a heavy weapons specialist. He was my star pupil and did go on to serve in the 44th. Chapter 9: The tide turns We've had string of losses after the landing back last year. It was time to take action. Now that I was back with the 44th brigade, I was reassigned to be 2nd lieutenant in charge of scientific research. This was a nice way of saying that my job was to lead an \"elite\" squad of men who would \"utilize new technology as a means to better combating our enemy\"; at least that's what the Captain said. I would be working with Brittany, who was chief of research, she designed it, and we wore it. We were called into the C.O.'s tent. He informed us that we would be using a new flame thrower pack in the next landing. He told us the plan. We were going to raid the muldines main base on their home planet. We would be under the command of lieutenant colonel Gravedoni. God help us, Gravedoni was a good desk jockey but he lacked \"in-the-field skills\". I wanted to say something but it wasn't my place. I could tell this would be a flop. Chapter 10: The big show Every one was going in, doctors, pilots, infantry, and us. We were right in the thick of it. We touched down under heavy fire. Armored vehicles had already landed and laid down covering fire for us to move on the capital. There was a trench surrounding the city. As we charged the trench, I came face to face with a muldine soldier. As I pulled up the barrel of my gun, I heard the click of a gun behind me. I felt a thump behind me and I hit the ground, I can't remember anything after that. Chapter 11: The death march I learned a new thing about the muldines, they are ruthless. I can't help but cry when I think of the march that they sent us on. We were sent to the muldine prison planet of Asmuth. As we moved through the jungle one of the prisoners collapsed and a guard shot him on the spot. We arrived at the prison complex just before sunrise a week after we landed. They took our cloths and gave us a tethered cloth smock. They then searched us and sent us to our quarters, which consisted of a metal table and chair, along with a small wax candle. They interrogated us with the aid of a machine that sent electric shocks throughout your body. Then thy moved us again. If you fell behind you died. Chapter 12: Jailbreak After about a month, rumors began to spread of a raid by G.U. – better known as the galactic union- forces. If these rumors were true then it was up to us to do what we could to aid our boys in the attack. That night, it happened. There were explosions all over the camp. I saw a transport land. For soldiers ran out, it was my old team, turns out that they joined the special weapons regiment a few weeks after me. As a guard ran by, I punched him and grabbed his rifle. I helped my self to one of his grenades and used it to blow up the wall of my cell. I shouted for little bit, she ran over and helped me get back to the ship. Turns out, I was the main objective. As other prisoners ran to seek refuge on the transport, lieutenant colonel Gravedoni pulled out his pistol and shot the prisoners. Three others were allowed on and that was it. A medic tried to look at my wounds but I pushed her away. At the time, I didn't realize it was Little bit. Chapter 13: Collateral damage About 4 years into the war, the \"enemy\", as they were called, began attacking our ships with long range rockets. We lost a couple of ships did get hit but we never lost a life due to it, until now. We were repairing the shield when the first rocket hit that day. It destroyed the one section of the ship and started fires in the quarters. I ran to the area in an attempt to help. As the fires eventually went out, we found hundreds of burn victims but the worst was ghost; his arm was completely incinerated and his leg was half gone. A medic ran over and was able to stop the bleeding, later on we found out that he did survive and went back home. \"How do I tell Brittany that her brother was so badly wounded?\" I thought. Chapter 14: The breaking point After the attack on the ship, we were sent the rear to assist with the moving of the wounded- which included ghost- to our hospital on the moon. Brittany was with us to comfort her brother but hardly ever spoke. I walked into her quarters to find her crying. I felt so bad. They were rationing like crazy now. You needed a permit to buy medicine, at least that's what my mom said. No one ever talked, not me or even M.J., and Zaire had been hit in the foot sometime ago and was confined to quarters for the next few months. We had lost all hope and were therefore useless at the front so we were ordered to return to earth to assist with the defense of the planet against an invasion that slipped right under our noses. What we found was extremely depressing. Chapter 15: Life at home When we touched down on earth, we were speechless. The invasion had been fought back but the damage was devastating. We quickly got to work. M.J. would go with Garvin and help at the capitol in D.C. while me and Little bit would go to Baltimore with Brittany. When we arrived in Baltimore I rushed to my house. My mother and father were there with my best friend who was in the galactic home guard. Thankfully he and my father fought of the muldine looters and hid in the basement. We met up with M.J. and Garvin. We all found our families and would fly them to stay with Garvin's family in North Carolina; we would form up with the rest of the 44th there. Chapter 16: Why we fight Although the U.S. had been secured, Mexico was still under enemy control. We were to be sent on long range patrols in Texas. This was my first fight on earth. We heard reports that he muldines had been using civilians for experiments but we didn't believe them until we found a camp full of dead civilians. I hope no one else ever has to see what I saw that day; burning bodies, dead children. There was nothing we could do here. I saw, the now, Gen. Gravedoni taking pictures and filling out papers. To him these were not casualties; they were just numbers and percentages in tomorrow's paper. I hate this war. Chapter 17: Ultimatum After the discovery of the prison camps, President Johnson issued an ultimatum to all Muldine forces occupying this or any other allied planet. \" To all enemy forces, lay down your weapons and return to your home planet or face total decimation.\" When the Muldine soldiers laughed at this statement, we knew there was only one way to win this war, total all out invasion. Chapter 18: End game We could feel that the war was coming to an end as we prepared for one final assault; the muldines had retreated to there on system but still launched bombing assaults. The only way to win was to quickly invade the planet and Kidnap the muldine minister of war, and then they would be brought to their knees and forced into negotiations or better yet unconditional surrender. With Gravedoni transferred, we would be under the command of Capt. McKenzie. It was time for revenge. As all of the transports landed, our artillery and armor laid down cover while we got of the ships. As we moved into and alley way inside the town I took the lead, firing six rounds from my rifle into the chest of a muldine soldier. As we cleared the alley I saw an anti-aircraft gun firing at our air support. I called little bit up and she fired a rocket and destroyed it. M.J. popped some smoke and we ran to a rally point outside the capital building. This was it. As day two of the invasion began we readied for our attack, we moved swiftly through the street and arrived at the door. Garvin placed explosives on the door and we ran in. we fired ad the guards and turned the corner just as a soldier fired a burst from a machine gun at us. Little bit dropped to the floor. I screamed for a medic and this girl from Delta Company named Mel came running up and took her away. M.J. got a call from air support; we had five minuets to get the muldine war chancellor out before they flattened the building. We busted into the chancellors office and tossed a flash grenade in. I grabbed the chancellor and put a pistol to his head. We ran out just as F-42 strato-fighters came in and dropped white phosphorus in on the building. We dived to the grown as the heat singed the backs of our uniforms. We had won the war. The call went out to all muldine soldiers as the chancellor addressed his people. He said: \" To all muldine fighting units in the area, you are to lay down your weapons and cease all aggressions against galactic union forces in accordance with the cease fire agreement. You are to hand over your weapons at the following locations…\" we had won the war. Epilogue: After the war M.J. went to Georgetown University on a full military scholarship. Ghost returned home and married his nurse from the hospital. Zaire lost a limb but was able to become a district attorney for the state of Maryland. Brittany and I dated for a while but went our separate ways; we still stay in touch today. Me and little bit stayed in the military. She went on to be a drop sergeant and I became supreme commander of the allied effort in former muldine occupied areas to help with the disarming efforts. The war left all of us with our own scars, whether they are on the outside or the inside. No one is sure who truly won the war and it's not for me to say either, history decides the winner. All I know is that this fight, our fight, the good fight, is over. -Gen Frank Ray, G.U.

Evidently, the brass had discovered some kind of Smart Bug on Planet P. They wanted that Bug. They wanted to discover how the enemy thought. They wanted to win. The Bugs had a different idea. The Bugs wanted to keep their Brain Bug safe. The Bugs wanted to win. Private Ilya Tolstoy wanted to stay alive. The vast cave systems of Planet P were the Bug's apparent natural environment. His squad had been ordered to hold this particular cavern in order to keep the main force from being overrun by the Bugs. Ilya knew that the orders were not truly to beat back the Arachnids, but to die slowly enough for the primary objective to be completed. So, he was trying not to die too quickly. Once again, the Bugs had a different idea. Desperation. Desperation was guiding all of Private Tolstoy's actions. The narrow tunnel was swarming with the loathsome creatures. All around him, the stench of the dead humans and aliens filled the air. The Russian was fighting back to back with the survivors of his platoon. \"Hey, George. How much ammo you have left?\" Tolstoy heard Private Kern ask. There was an edge of hysteria in his voice. He was nearly broken. \"Enough to get out of this. Now shut up and kill some damn bugs! \" Franklin nearly roared. Mostly, over the screeching of the Arachnids and the gunfire but also to hide the worry. Ilya whooped in a weary attempt at boosting morale and poured even more fire into a charging alien beast. Chunks of flesh and fountains of ichor scattered from the Soldier bug. As the creature died, the distant rumbling of a nuke detonation filled the chamber. Moments later a second, much closer, detonation rumbled through the cave. The last arachnid fell to the Lieutenant's under-barrel shotgun. Exhilaration filled the few human survivors. The fact that they had survived was a beautiful thing. \"We survived! We can win! We're going to be ok!\" Private Kern hollered. The ground groaned and gave way. Murphy was never subtle in his revenge. After an uncomfortably long time, Tolstoy managed to drag himself to his feet. The fall wasn't as bad as it could have been. Granted, he was sore and slightly bleeding but nothing was broken. As he looked around, he realized that he was one of the lucky ones. Several members of his squad were broken. It was the most accurate way to describe what was left of them. One of his fellows had his skull crushed and he was practically impaled on a rocky spire. Others where just bent unnaturally or smashed by huge rocks. Kern clawed away from one of the mangled corpses. Several of the other troopers staggered away. There was some moaning from those too injured to move. \"Corporal Franklin?\" Tolstoy called out. George was their highest ranking soldier after the Lt. Had been gutted by an Arachnid. \"Dead.\" A weary voice called out from behind. One of the soldiers was going to each of the wounded, checking their condition. She was no doubt a doctor before the war. The eyes of the squad turned to Tolstoy. Great, I spoke first so I'm the leader. He took a deep breath, even though it felt as if someone had set him on fire as he did it. \"Ok, You guys\" He pointed to a group standing around staring around aimlessly. \"Follow me. We're going to look for a way out of here and a way to get the wounded out.\" \"Doc!\" He didn't know the young woman's name. She was one of the reinforcements straight from the Core Colonies. \"You're in charge here. Do everything you can. We'll be back with help as soon as we can.\" The young woman nodded. \"Sir!\" She promptly went back to work. Tolstoy motioned for the group he ordered to follow. They did so with reluctance. \"Let's move it. I don't want to be trapped in this shithole!\" There were some grumbling, but they followed. It was only then, that Ilya noticed his surroundings. There was a green haze hugging the ground. There was an undeniable sense of foreboding. The Mobile Infantry advanced slowly through the darkness. After a while, one of the troopers stopped and looked at the surroundings. \"We're not in a bughole.\" The soldier felt a number of eyes turn towards him. Kern shifted uncomfortably. \"What are you talking about? How can you be sure?\" The soldier fiddled with his rifle. \"Because the walls have been carved .\" The soldiers took in the walls. The rocks had far too many right angles to be natural. Ilya walked forward and ran his hands along the wall. The black stone of the wall was smooth, almost glossy. Everything in this place was unexpected. A somewhat welcoming sight was a tunnel entrance. There was an upward incline to the ramp. The tired soldiers advanced cautiously. \"Who ever did it is likely long dead. The Bugs probably saw to that. Come on, we need to get to the surface or at least somewhere we can get a signal.\" All the soldiers gaped in shock. This was no cavern. If there was any doubt that this chamber was artificial, the giant pulsing generator ended any other possibility. A sickly green light seemingly flowed like water. \"What is this place?\" Kern turned in place, taking in all the gloom of the place. \"It's a tomb .\" The soldier who had noticed the artificial nature of the place first spoke with a shaking voice. He walked up and stared blankly at what appeared to be a sarcophagus decorated with a stylized symbol. It almost looked like a cross of one of Earth's abandoned religions. Kern was shaking now. \"A tomb for wha...\" There was a wet sound that was familiar to the troopers. Kern had just been impaled. Kern's murderer was no bug. It was something worse . The thing was barely visible. It's shell was a twilight gray. The only thing easily seen was the bone-white death's head mask and the lifeless green eyes staring at the squad. And Kern's blood running down the monster's needle-like claws. \"NO!\" One of the troopers screamed. The phantom tilted its head, seemingly in confusion. It then ripped Kern in half and tossed him away. \"Kill it you idiots!\" Ilya screamed, terror dripping from his words. The squad opened fire. Rounds bounced off the body of the enemy. And then... It turned to mist and receded into the shadows like a wraith. Slowly, the Mobile Infantry stopped shooting. They were merely wasting ammo. An unnaturally loud hiss filled the air as the sarcophagus began to open. As machine's lifted the casket, lights erupted all throughout the chamber. The MI stared in mute horror as row upon row of skeletal constructs stretched for as far as they could see. \"We are so fucked! RUN!\" One of the troopers screamed as he broke for the tunnel entrance. He never made it. One of the skeletal ones brought the ax head of the strange device it carried on the soldier. The unfortunate human was nearly split in half. All around them, soulless green eyes appeared in each of the metal skeletons. The creatures marched out in perfect unison. The MI opened fire to no effect. Their fire pinged helplessly off the advanced material shells of the MI's doom. As one, the agents of death raised their weapons and fired. The impacts were horrific in their damage. It was if someone was peeling them away layer by layer, molecule by molecule. Ilya's mind snapped and he ran and ran. He impacted into something hard. Tolstoy yelled out in pain. He looked up, blood streaming from his broken nose. He gazed upon Death. A gaunt lifeless face stared down on him. In the center of the parody of an Egyptian Pharaoh's chest was a glowing core. It lifted an orb of some kind. A hoarse cry escaped from somewhere . The pulsating core began to rise in concert with the staff in the Lord of Death's left hand. Tolstoy tried to scream, but a metal foot crashed down crushing his chest. The staff of the Лорд смерти was the last thing Ilya Tolstoy of St. Petersburg ever saw. The surface of Planet P was a site of triumph. Soldiers whooped and fired their rifles as a squad dragged their quarry from the crypts of this forsaken world. The Brainbug writhed in a feeble attempt to escape. A trio of old friends; a naval pilot, an MI soldier and an Intelligence officer walked off in triumph. \"You know, when the three of us are together, I think everything will be ok.\" The female naval pilot smiled broadly. Lt. Johnny Rico was about to respond when the screaming started. At the mouth of the cave, men were dying. Before the terrified eyes of their compatriots, they were dissolving. Phalanx after Phalanx of utterly silent seemingly robotic warriors emerged from the cave systems. Johny watched in horror as one of the warriors who had been blown in half with a grenade claw itself over to its severed lower half and reconnect. The deathless machine rose to its feet and took its place in another Phalanx. Then there was the welcome sound of a fighter flight screaming towards their location. Salvation was coming. But, there would be no salvation. One of the fighters was destroyed by a single bolt of green energy that erupted from behind one of the mesas. The second fighter was caught by a whip of sickly green energy and casually thrown into a cliff wall. A pyramid of what looked like solid black stone slide inches off the ground towards the now broken troops. Each shot from its weapon struck with the force of a nuke. The Fleet was being overwhelmed by calls for orbital bombardment. Mobile Infantry soldiers were dying in the thousands by the second. The Admiral in charge was preparing to give the all clear when one of his fleet's remaining ships exploded. It had been rammed . The Admiral managed to get a single look at the strangely beautiful craft. It was an elegant pyramid resting on a crescent moon. \"Goodbye, Maria.\" It was the only sound on the bridge as an arc of lightning sliced his ship in half. The space around Planet P was alight with the Funeral Pyres of Mankind. Far away, beneath the snowy mountains near the Galactic Rim, inside the stillness of a mind-shattering Orbital Construct encircling a dying star, inside the crypts of a airless ball of stone and deep within the labyrinths of a world of rusted sands, a signal was received.

Voice muffled, he attended to her comment, \"We're moving to Long Beachrnbecause that's where your dad wants us to go.\" Sagernrolled her eyes and folded two tee-shirts expertly. \"Whatever. I want to gornsomewhere fun, like Hawaii. That would be awesome .\" \"I'llrnlet him know that, kiddo,\" a deep voice came from the stairs. Sage turned tornsee Tumbler enter the room with his arms full of boxes. Tumblerrnhadn't changed in 16 years. He was still well built, handsome,rnand—slightly—dumb. But everybody loved him and he roomed with Kip, therebyrnmaking him the fourth member of the house, so they overlooked his few momentsrnof ignorance. In fact, Sage often thought, if she were older or he was younger,rnthey would make a really great match. Hernwas pretty much everyone's favorite older brother. He teased her, and got herrnout of trouble with Kip—who mostly watched her since her dad was busy withrnwork—and made sure she ate a sufficient amount of junk food. Because of him,rnshe up to date on all the latest swear words and cool phrases and in return,rnshe promised to ask her friends if they had any \"hot older sisters.\" \"Wouldrnyou?\" She asked, rising to snatch a box from his arms and starting to pack morernof her uncle's shirts in it. \"Because I really think he picks the lamest placesrnon the planet. At least New York was cool. Why couldn't we stay there again?\" Kip,rnwho's head was visible again as he tossed more shirts to his niece, exchanged arnglance with Tumbler. \"Uhm, because it was too dangerous for you. It's not likernwe could walk you to school every morning and there was some pretty badrnshi—stuff goin' down there.\" Herrneyebrows raised. \"Guys, you can curse around me. It's not like I don't hearrnit at school.\" \"Wellrnmaybe that's why I pulled us out of New York, sweetheart.\" Sagernjumped and saw her dad leaning in the doorway. At 37 years old, he didn't lookrnhalf bad, and she knew it. All her friends' moms' were always talking aboutrnhim. Tall, medium-haired like hers, and piercing blue eyes made up the packagernthat was Randall Raines. For some reason, she always thought he would lookrnbetter in leather, but he stuck to jeans and oxford shirts these days, so shernassumed she had inhaled too much smoke by accident. Herncame to sit on the bed next to her. \"I know this is hard for you, but I promise this is the last move we'll ever make.\" He grabbed her around the waist andrnsqueezed her tightly. \"Forrnreal? You're not kidding?\" \"Swear.\" Shernbreathed a heavy sigh of relief and hugged him back. Then she pulled away tornlook in his eyes. \"I'm gonna hold you to that, Dad.\" Hernsmiled. \"I know.\" Withoutrnwarning, Tumbler and Kip launched themselves on the bed and yelled, \"GROUPrnHUG!\" Sage was squashed between the three men in her life and she loved it.rnThis was how her family was supposed to be. This was the way her life wasrnsupposed to go. Sherncould only hope it would stay that way in Long Beach. *** (Twornand half weeks later.) Thernroom looked like a bomb had gone off. Shirts were all over the place, pantsrnwere hanging half on hangers, half off. Her bed wasn't made and there was junkrneverywhere. All the drawers to her dressers were open and what scant clothingrnshe had managed to put away from the move was also draped precariously over thernedge. Shernstood in the center of chaos, dressed only in a pair of low-rise jeans and herrnbra. Any minute now, Kip would be yelling up to her, telling her that she wasrngoing to be late for her first day at her new school, that she was going tornmiss her breakfast, and that he didn't care what the hell she was doing uprnthere, she had better get her ass down here or there wasn't going to be a first day of school. Arnknock on the door was her only warning before Tumbler burst in. \"Sage, yournbetter get down there. Kip's gonna have a cow and I'm don't think you want tornsee him give birth to the new Big Mac.\" He closed the door. Sagernfell back onto her bed with a loud groan. The door opened again and she sat up.rn\"What?!\" Tumblerrnwhistled. \"Nice bra.\" Shernreached for the pillow beside her and threw it at his head. He chuckled andrnleft the room again. Forrna minute she just sat there, looking over things in her room with a calculatingrngleam in her eye. Then, like a panther, she leaped over to her desk and startedrnto go through the things in her chair. While she was wildly tossing things overrnher shoulder, Kip walked in. Hernopened his mouth to speak and she accidentally tossed a pair of clean underwearrnon his head. Slowly, he reached up and pulled the panties down, as a low growlrnformed in his throat. Sagerngradually stopped her frenzied searching and looked over her shoulder. Her eyesrnwidened dramatically and she reached into the pile one more time, emergingrnvictorious with a bell-sleeved dark green shirt. She pulled it on over herrnhead, grabbed the well-used book bag that was resting innocently by therndoorway, and scooted past her irate uncle to scarf down her omelet. Kiprncounted to 10 and prayed for strength, then headed after his niece, who wasrngoing to be in a world of hurt when he was through with her. \"Irnswear on the hood of my Porsche, Sage, if you are late to school this morning,rnI am going to beat you .\" Shernnodded and furiously continued forking egg in her mouth. Five bites later, thernplate was clean and she'd chased the egg down with a glass of orange juice.rn\"Let's go.\" *** \"Okay,rnnow you know to refer to us all by our real names. No Memphis for your dad, andrnit's gotta be Tommy for Tumbler. Don't mention that you rarely see your father,rnand that you've moved 17 times in your life. They'll find that out on yourrntranscripts, and I really don't think that's something you need to announce tornyour class. Also—\" \"UnclernKip! I know . I'm could write the book on this.\" She reached in the backrnof the sports car for her book bag and threw her head forward to tousle thernwaves in her hair. \"I'll see you at 2.\" She kissed him on the cheek and exitedrnthe car. Kiprnwaited until she was safely inside the front doors before peeling away from therncurb. He dialed a number on his cell-phone and spoke into it. \"I just droppedrnher off. So far, so good.\" *** Sagernglanced down at the schedule in her hand and up at the door. Yep. This wasrndefinitely her first class. English. What fun. Tumblerrnwould tell her to stop being such a freakin' wussy and go in already , sornshe hesitantly pushed the door open and stepped into the classroom.rnImmediately, all conversation stopped. The room was silent. Arnyoung woman, with very dark brown hair and light green eyes looked up from herrnnotes. \"Come on in. You must be Sage, our new student. I'm Ms. Nichols, by thernway.\" Shernnodded and walked to the center of the room. \"Where should I sit?\" Thernteacher looked up again and gave her classroom a look. \"Um… Why don't you takernthe seat in front of Jesse and then we'll continue with our lesson. I don'trnbelieve in that embarrassing \"Introduce yourself in front of the class\" crap.\" Sagerntook a seat near the back of the class, in front of a handsome African Americanrnboy, her shoulders slumped gratefully. Even though she'd done it countlessrntimes, standing up and introducing herself to new classmates seemed like anrnobscure form of torture employed only by teachers who had no hobby but to makerntheir students miserable. Ms.rnNichols smiled at her. \"You guys, this is Sage Raines. She comes to us fromrnReno, and now we are going to keep learning about Beowulf . If yournhave any more questions, kindly direct them to Sage herself, after class .\" Therernwas a collective groan and as she pulled a binder out of her bag to take notes,rnshe was glad this was her first class. It was obvious this Ms. Nichols had arncool relationship with her students and that they loved her just as much. Thernclass went by pretty quickly after that. She scrawled some nonsense aboutrnGrendel and the meaning the book had for her life today and then the bell hadrnrung. Her next class was gym and she'd passed it on her way in, so she didn'trnstay to talk to anyone. Onrnher way out the door, however, Ms. Nichols stopped her. \"Sage?\" Shernwalked back into the room and stopped at her desk. \"Yeah?\" \"Irnjust want you to know that if I don't know a student's parents through schoolrngames or class trips or something, I usually send a letter home to set up arnconference. I didn't want you to be worried or anything when you got one in thernmail later this week.\" Shernsmiled gratefully. \"Thanks. My uncle, for some reason, gets very hyper aboutrnthose sorts of things and I'm sure he'll appreciate your doing so.\" Therndarker brunette had a confused look on her face. \"Your uncle? Is he your legalrnguardian?\" \"No,rnhe just lives with me and my dad. But my dad usually doesn't have time for myrnschool-related things. I barely see him. So my uncle and his best friend havernpretty much raised me all my life. He always goes to my parent-teacherrnconferences, too.\" Ms.rnNichols looked dubious. \"Okay, if you say so. But I really would like tornmeet your father, Sage.\" She looked at the clock. \"Shi--oot. I think I justrnmade you late to your next class. Hold on a sec, I'll write you a pass.\" Sagerntook it with an inward grin. It wasn't everyday that a teacher slipped likernthat. \"Thanks. Showing up late on the first day is not a way to scorernpoints with the teachers.\" Herrnteacher watched her as she exited the room and frowned. \"A father she neverrnsees, her transcripts indicate she's changed schools 13 times… What has thisrngirl been through? And her name is Raines. God, I have a weird feelingrnabout this.\" *** Gymrnwent well and she headed off to Lab Chem, where she was once again, paired uprnwith Jesse. She basically took notes the entire period and her hand was aboutrnto fall off when she left class. AfterrnChem was Trig—not something she was looking forward to— at all . Thernteacher waited for all the students to sit and then pointed out the onlyrnavailable seat… which was in front of Jesse. Whenrntheir teacher faced the blackboard and started lecturing, she felt movementrnbehind her and moments later, shivered when she felt his breath on her neck.rn\"I'm sensing a pattern here.\" \"You'rernnot the only one,\" she muttered, hoping he didn't hear her. \"Mr.rnCastleback! Miss Raines! Does there seem to be a problem here?\" Butrnunfortunately, the teacher had. Sagernslid down in her seat and wished a very painful injury on this woman. But fromrnbehind her, Jesse spoke up. \"Not at all, Mrs. Clark. We were just discussingrnSage's schedule. Since she's a new student and all, I offered to help her.rnTurns out we have nearly every class together. How's that for a firstrnday of school gift?\" Thernteacher looked somewhat bewildered. \"Yes, well… Linear equations …\" Whenrnshe turned back to the board, Sage whirled around in her seat and glared atrnhim. \"Are you nuts? She's going to kill us!\" Hisrnbrown eyes twinkled and he tapped her on the nose playfully. \"She will if yourndon't turn around, or my name isn't Jesse Castleback.\" Hernleft her to ponder his level of sanity and the strange feeling she got when shernwas near him. Hey, I wonder if Kip knows Jesse's dad? ' *** That'srnall for now! The real stuff comes in the next few chapters. REVIEW!!![Chapter 3] Life is Like A Bowl Of Cherries Chapter 2nPG-13nSerenity Sean(Serenity_Sea@yahoo.com) * ~ * ~ * ~ * The sound of plates being passed and the ceramic hitting the table was thenonly noise for some time. Then, cardboard scraping cardboard hit the airnand the scent of pizza assailed their senses. For the next few minutes,neach family member was engrossed in inhaling has much pizza as they could. Finally, when they had broken for air at about the same time, Memphisnlooked across the table at his daughter. \"How did school, go, honey?\" She looked up at her father, confused. \"It went fine. Why? Did you thinknit wouldn't?\" \"No. I never said that.\" Her lips twisted in a bitter smile. \"Yeah. That's what I thought.\" Hernchair shoved back from the table and she jumped up and ran from the room.nThe sound of her door slammed and Memphis closed his eyes defeatedly. Henpushed back his own chair- \"No.\" Kip said from his place at the table. \"Eat your pizza. Give her a fewnminutes to cool off. Then I'll go talk to her.\" Memphis looked at Tumbler for guidance, who nodded regretfully, agreeingnwith his best friend. He sighed and then moved back in closer to the tablento his place. Across from him, Kip continued to eat his pizza at a slow pace, alternatingnevery few bites with a swing of beer. About 10 bites later, he stood up andngrabbed his plate to put it in the sink. \"Tumbler - it's your turn to washnthe dishes for Sage.\" Without another word to his brother, he left the room. * * * Three hours later, Kip came back emerged from Sage's room with red eyes.n\"God, Mem, I don't know what you did to piss her off.... but you sure did angood job off it.\" Memphis watched the figures dance across the screen, registering Kip'snwords. \"She's too much like her mother, Kip. Being around Sage... was likenbeing around *her*. I couldn't take it.\" \"So you let her fade from your life?\" Kip asked incredulously, and his tonenwas one of having had this conversation many times before. \"It hurt, Kip,\" He said tiredly. \"And by the time it stopped hurting, itnwas too late. She was too used to you and Tumbler. She didn't need me innher life.\" The younger brother thought of his own father, how he'd felt after he died,nand shook his head. \"You always need a father in your life.\" Memphis sighed deeply. \"I've tried to make it better, you know I have. Butnit's too late. The time for that has come and gone. She has got so manyndefensive walls when it comes to me, I wouldn't even know where to start. Indon't know my own daughter,\" he turned to Kip with soulless eyes, \"and shendoesn't want to know me.\" Kip bit his lip to keep from blurting out what would only get them into anneven bigger argument and started to walk out of the room. He paused in thendoorframe. \"You need to call them.\" Memphis closed his eyes painfully, acceptingly. \"I know.\" With that said, Kip left the room and Memphis to his thoughts and the mutednTV set. Calling them or not wouldn't change the fact that his daughter wasna stranger to him. It would only open up more of the past that he'd triednto hard to protect her from, and he didn't know if he-or she-was ready fornthat yet. Unfortunately, there was only one way to find out. * * * Sage looked down at the text message on her phone and closed her eyes innresignation. It was from Kip and it said to get a ride home because he wasnin a meeting and wasn't going to make it. That wouldn't have been too much of a problem - she'd made friends fast -nexcept it was nearly an hour after dismissal and anyone she knew inndetention didn't get out for another 45 minutes. Everyone else had left. One saving grace was that she was wearing her leather boots and not a pairnof strappy shoes as she tended to on occasion. With a sigh, she shifted hernbag and started walking away from the school. * * * He slammed the phone down in frustration. \"Unbelievable! She's had a cellnphone since she was ten; you'd think by now that she'd pick it up whennsomeone calls.\" Kip Raines was upset. Actually, that was an understatement. He'd callednhome nearly an hour ago and Sage hadn't answered. She hadn't answered herncell phone either, and it was usually attached to her. Knowing his niecenthe way he did, she'd probably gotten the message late and was doingnsomething stupid like trying to walk home. She wasn't that dumb, was she? Groaning, he got up from his desk and called for Tumbler through the openndoor. They would have to sort this mess out themselves or Memphis wouldnnever forgive them. He was fiercely protective of his daughter, for all hisnnot showing it. Tumbler stopped in front of the Kip's slouched form, breathing heavily.n\"What's up?\" Kip looked furtively for any sign of Memphis and then explained thensituation. Tumbler's eyes got bigger and bigger until they were the size of dinnernplates. He cursed angrily and then looked at Kip. \"She's not that stupid,nright?\" He shot him a slanted look. \"Let's hope not.\" * * * Now she was in some seedy part of town and had to face the fact that she'dntaken a wrong turn somewhere. After two weeks of having Kip drive her tonschool, she knew the route with her eyes closed. Which didn't account fornher current status of being lost without a clue, but the way things were innher life these days - *Dad* - it didn't surprise her. Streetlights flickered on above her as the sun continued its slow descentnand shadows became longer. Sage looked around and recognized the Quik-Martnas the one in the center of town. She suddenly felt a bit more confidentnand sure of her surroundings. A pair of bright high beams settled on her and then moved as the car turnedndown the street. She was aware of it following her at a slow pace until shenstopped - a stupid, *stupid* thing to do, one thing Kip and Tumbler hadnbeaten into her head after a bad incident in Manhattan - and turned to facenthe car with her hands on her hips. \"Are you following me for a reason, or just cause you have anseriously perverted mind?\" The driver in the sleek sports car leaned over the passenger's seat,nremaining hidden from view. \"I just like to cruise the boulevard. You sortanremind me of someone I used to know.\" Knowing what she was about to do was something she was never, ever supposednto do, under any circumstances whatsoever, Sage closed the distance betweennherself and the car until her legs brushed the polished silver exterior andnshe could see the black leather seats. Leaning with her arms resting on thenopen window, with her head peering inside, she asked, \"Oh yeah? Who'snthat?\" Up until this time, she didn't know the African American race could losenthe color in their face as easily as she did, with her startlingly palenskin. The young man with reflective sunglasses on - she could easily seenhim now - fumbled with the handle and the door fell open. \"Get in the car,\" he said, his voice shaky. Sage's eyes widened incredulously. \"No way!\" \"Get. In. The Car.\" She started to move away and he said firmly,n\"*Now.*\" She looked heavenward for strength and prayed he wouldn't kill her, thennslid her bag higher onto her shoulder and got into the car, wondering whatnin the world was possessing her to get into the car with a stranger. * * * Memphis strolled into Kip's office with a smile on his face. \"Kip! I justngot a call from Ms. Nichols, Sage's homeroom and English teacher,\" he tooknoff his jacket and hung it on the coat rack, \"and she said Sage is doingnexcellent in her classes.\" When there was no answer, he turned around,n\"Kip?\" His brother wasn't at his desk. Ten minutes later revealed that he was not in the cafeteria, the gym or thenparking lots. He had to be, as he walked away from the office that nownbelonged to Tumbler - which was not surprisingly empty - *with* Tumbler.nNormally, this wouldn't have bothered him. Except it was nearly 4:30, Kip and Tumbler were both gone. They didn'tnleave their offices unless one of them had to pick up Sage or run an errandnof some kind; they believed in staying until closing. Bu they didn't close until 6. And he was worried. * * * The ride was silent and it was all Sage could do not to grab the wheelnherself and pull them over to the side of the road, demanding where thenhell he was taking her. Of course, that would be bad, because she wasn'tntoo great at evasive maneuvers, and for all she knew he could have a leadnpipe in the back and was just waiting for the right time to use it. 'That's not likely,' her ever-logical mind reasoned. 'After all, why wouldnhe go through all the trouble of making you get in the car if all he wantednto do was knock you out? He's older than you; he could have easily chasednyou down if it was necessary. Besides. People who dress in neon yellow FUBUnoutfits aren't usually serial killers. Serial killers try to blend in withnthe crowd and this guy obviously wants to stand out in a big way.' The signs on the road that she recognized became fewer and farther innbetween and she started to worry. \"Where are you taking me?\" He seemed hesitant to look at her again, and she wondered what exactly hadnhim so shook up. \"Somewhere safe.\" Her eyebrows arched high. \"Are we in danger or something?\" \"More than you could possibly imagine,\" he answered her seriously andnshe felt a chill skitter down her spine. Still, she wasn't going to take this vague reply for an answer and shiftednin her seat to look more closely at him. He was about Kip's age, shenguessed, and rather slim. Judging from how he sat in the bucket seats, henwas also a bit on the short side, though you really couldn't tell since henmore than compensated that with his choice in clothing. The sunglasses werenstill on, despite the sun having gone down 20 minutes ago, and she wonderednwhat color eyes he had and how he could still see the road in front ofnthem. He drove very well, with an ease that she standard with the men in hernfamily and she knew that regardless of the make or model, he could havendriven a 20-year-old Volkswagen the same involved way. \"Do you at least have a name?\" Sage demanded in a tone thinly lacednwith impatience. * * * He cast a glance over at her again, daring to rest his eyes a second longernthan necessary, wanting to reassure himself that it truly wasn't *her*, asnhe had foolishly believed her to be, but someone else - someone who he'dnseen in picture that had been sent in a forgotten Christmas card severalnyears back. The card hadn't been sent to him, it had been sent to thenperson they were going to see and he wondered what he was going to say tonmake this entire situation make sense. The least of his problems was whatnname to give her; it had been so long since he'd met someone he didn'tnknow, or didn't know of him, and he doubted that she would take anythingnless than his Christian name for an answer. Trouble was, it had been sonlong, he'd nearly forgotten what his Christian name was. He settled on the name he'd used for the past two decades. \"Mirror.\" A 'get real' look set in her features and she smirked. \"Yeah right. And mynname is Glass.\" He lifted one hand off the steering wheel and merely pointed at hisnsunglasses. Understanding dawned in her eyes. \"I get it.\" She paused. \"Inguess I shouldn't have been so surprised. My unc-I have some friends withnstranger names.\" \"It's actually Mirror Man, on account of my being a man and.\" He sawnthe smirk on her face and it took him flying back more then ten years; butnit still had the power to humble him. \"Never mind.\" They drove on in silence, and she let her eyes take in all the details ofnthe car - something she could report back to Kip later, if she made it outnof this alive. This was obviously the car with the extra package, an 8-discnCD changer, BOSE speakers that were strategically placed around thentravelers to make the sound fuller, cherry lacquered trim around the dashnand door handles, and of course, the ever-present blinking red light on thencorner of the stereo that she knew was merely a decoy for the monsternsecurity system woven throughout the car. At this point in her conversation with her uncle, he and Tumbler wouldnshare a wistful gaze or if he was by himself, a ghost of a smile wouldnappear on his lips, leaving her like she was missing the end of somenrunning joke that had been in their past. Mirror noticed her drinking in the car and all the features with anpracticed eye and had to shake his head. If he'd been questioning itnbefore, it was blatantly obvious now. She was made to sit behind the wheelnof a red sports car, just like her mother, and drive the hell out of itnuntil she just couldn't drive anymore. The cool assessment of the vehiclencame from her father, and partly her uncle - his former best friend, withnwhom he'd had little to no contact with in the past years - but would helpnher discern whether or not the risk was necessary. It didn't occur to him that she knew nothing about her mother, the same asnthey did, or that her father had long since retired fully from then'business,' taking his younger brother and best friend with him. He only knew that the thrill of boosting cars was in her blood. And as soon as someone opened her eyes to that thrill, and she could handlenthem as expertly as her parents once had, she was going to tear thisncomplacent town of Long Beach apart. And he was going to help her. * * * Sage never took her eyes off the road, for all her checking out the car andnasking questions. It came to mind that she might have to make the trip backnhome by herself, and she didn't want to get lost. So while it appeared thatnshe was looking at all inches of the car, she really kept one eye on thenroad and stored away the information in her mind. The car finally slowed some, and she saw a high, chain-link fence thatnparted slowly to let them through. Ahead of them lay an old wooden buildingnwith a faded sign on it that she couldn't make out in the darkness. Thenonly other distinguishable element to add up was the large graveyard ofncars that surrounded them. All sorts of cars, from the expensive ones, like the very car she was innright now, to older, classic cars that she barely recognized. There was onenshadowed form to her far right, that was draped over tightly with a blackntarp and before she could stop the words from tumbling out, she asked,n\"What kind of car is that?\" Mirror turned to her with a smile that she couldn't yet decipher; thoughnshe got the impression he was almost proud of her for some reason. Hendidn't answer her, though, merely turned the car off and unlocked the doornfor her to get out. She left her bag on the seat and waited for him to lead wherever they werengoing. He moved with purposeful strides to the front of the building andnopened up a huge door with a jaunty flourish. It was anti-climatically darkninside and she couldn't make out a thing, but he was halfway across thenroom when he called, \"Wait here,\" and she wasn't about to take her chancesnjust yet. Suddenly, the lights above her flickered on, almost reluctant to reveal thensecret of her location and something slammed into her as she looked aroundnat what had all the makings of a body shop. '*She had been here before. And she knew this place as much as she wasncertain the sun rose in the east every morning and Earth was round.*' Two chalkboards, covered in cobwebs and a thick layer of dust stoodnproudly, if somewhat out of place, in the back of the room, and while shenitched, for some reason, to get over there and read them, her attention wasntaken up by the rest of the room. Cars rested on lifts and tools laynscattered about on every surface possible, while the place reeked faintlynof gasoline and anti-freeze. Paint splatters of varying color decoratednmultiple spots on the cement flooring and some even reached the walls. Echoing footsteps sounded from behind her and she whirled around to seenMirror coming down a steep metal staircase that led up to a loft of sorts.nFace hidden from view, she could make out another man close on his heelsnand watched with a detached interest as they made their way over to her,ndeftly walking around the cars and plentiful tools that were strewn acrossnthe floor. Finally, they got close and Mirror stepped aside to reveal his companion. The man looked old. He was obviously much older than her father, andnjudging by the lines etched around his eyes and mouth that only added tonthe effect, life hadn't been easy for him. A pair of faded navy overallsnrested on his still-trim form and with his slightly slicked-back hair, henlooked as though he belonged in another time, though he plainly fit innhere. The clear blue eyes threw her for a loop, though, and made her take ancloser look at their new company. Identification hit her like a sucker-npunch to the gut and she sucked in an audible breath. \"*Uncle Otto*?\" * * * End chapter two. Sorry it took so long to get out; I've been working on half a dozen thingsnat once and this was sort of sitting on my computer, waiting to be readnthrough and proofed before it could be sent out. Because you all love me SOnvery much and that is going to be demonstrated with all the reviews younleave, I have a present for you: Chapter three is also posted. Now all you have to do is wait a bajillion years for chapter 4.[Chapter 4] Life is Like A Bowl Of Cherries Chapter 3nSerenity Sean(Serenity_Sea@yahoo.com) * ~ * ~ * ~ * Otto Halliwell stared at the young girl before him and wondered how in thenworld he let her slip away. As her godfather, he should have fought harder,nmade his surrogate son stay in Long Beach - at least in the state - so hencould help raise her and see what type of woman she would grow up to be.nNow, though, her metamorphosis was almost complete and he had missed all ofnit. \"Sage,\" he opened his arms and she flew into them with a childlikeninnocence. His arms wrapped tightly around her, and she smelled faintly ofnthe familiar combination of citrus and gasoline, and he had to smile. After one more squeeze, she pulled back to look at him, the attitudenseeping out of her and her unusual green eyes lighting up with a smile. \"Incan't believe it's you. I thought I'd never see you again.\" Otto smiled in return and put an arm around her shoulder. \"Well, wencouldn't have that, now could we?\" She shook her head wordlessly and henguided her over to the steps so she could sit and he could take in hernappearance. Sage's hair had darkened considerably since he'd last since her - thoughnthat was nearly five years ago, and to be expected - and she'd grown intontall and slender frame. She was quite thin - which worried him, because thenlast person he'd seen that thin had been her mother before she disappearedn- but her eyes had remained that same, silver-green with a trace of sadnessnher new attitude hid well. She looked like a carbon copy of her mother. When her mother had had darker hair and had first joined up with theirncrew. Way before Kip had been involved and Atley had been injured, and still withnthem. She changed it after Memphis left, thinking that she could change thenpast if she changed her present, and when she left the business a yearnlater, it was still same the pale blonde, twisted in dreadlocks, thatnthey'd come to associate with her name. Still smiling, he asked, \"When did you get into town? Assuming, of course,nthat Mirror didn't kidnap you from another state.\" A slightly admonishingngaze was thrown his way but Mirror just smiled easily and quietly left thenroom. \"A little under a month by now, I guess. It's flown by pretty quick-nI'm surprised my father hasn't called you yet.\" Otto noticed her tone cooled considerably as her eyes had shuttered overnwith some emotion and knew that the relationship was strained betweennfather and daughter. His heart went out to both of them and hoped that itncould be worked out even as he stifled the immediate reaction of anger thatnMemphis had been in town for such a time and neglected to mention it. \"Ah, well, he wouldn't,\" Otto replied, knowing that it was high timenshe knew the truth about. *all of it.* \"He's given up his past andneverything with it.\" Intrigued, Sage leaned her elbows on her legs with the same intensity hernmother had when learning about some new exotics and murmured, \"Do tell.\" He had to blink several times to clear the image of her mother that hadnsuper-imposed itself on top of her and cleared his throat. \"Why don't wenget something to eat first. You must be starving.\" Her stomach growled audibly and they laughed. * * * * * \"I'm tellin' you, man, it was weird. It was like starin' at. *her*nall over again. She's a friggin' clone.\" Two faces looked up at him with antolerating look and he groaned. \"You just wait. When Otto brings her innhere, you'll see what I'm talking about.\" He took his seat at a long table next to a stoic-looking man and elbowednhim in the side. \"You believe me, right, Sphinx?\" The Sphinx gave him a chilling look that clearly stated, \"Get your elbownout of my *bleeping* side before I shove it up your ass. Backwards.\" Mirror Man shrugged, too used to the man's stares by now to be intimidated.n\"You'll see,\" he repeated quietly, reaching for a piece of pizza. And they did see. He had the satisfaction of watching them-even Sphinx-drop their pizza onnthe plate and jaws drop open in shock when Otto guided Sage through thendoorway. \"Come now, fellows. You don't want to scare Sage off, now, do you?\" With an effort, they closed their mouths and looked at each other in shocknbefore directing their gazes back to her. A raven-haired young man with dark eyes was first to speak. \"Sorry thatnwe're all starin' at you. It's just that. well, you look a hell of a lotnlike someone we used to know.\" Her gaze immediately met Mirror's, remembering his earlier statement andnthe previous incident. \"Don't mind Freb, there. He has a tendency to speaknup even when he's not supposed to.\" She looked inquiringly at the younger-looking man next to Freb. \"And younare?\" He blushed and she found it refreshing. \"Uh, Toby.\" A smile curved her lips. \"Mirror, Toby, and Freb. That's a catchy group younhave.\" For some reason, it sounded unbalanced, even to her ears, and she grewnuncomfortable with the fact that her uncle and Tumbler had probably knownnthem at one time. Then her gaze settled on the grim, silent man sittingnnext to Mirror and involuntarily took a step back into Otto, who steadiednher by the shoulders. Mirror grinned at her reaction and nudged The Sphinx again. \"Dude, I *told*nyou. Turn down the glare when we have company.\" He looked up at Sage with angrin. \"This here is Sphinx. And don't take offense to the fact that hendoesn't talk back. It's not you. It's just the way he is.\" Sphinx's eyes slid up glaringly and Mirror moved away with a tentativensmile. \"I'm just gonna go sit over here and grab myself a beer.\" She looked to Otto for reassurance, who nodded, and started to sit downnnext to the scary looking Sphinx. She had gotten one leg over the picnicnbench when voices came from their right. In strolled two men, a tall black man with closely cut hair and a warmnsmile and a shorter man with a gimp and slicked back hair that put Otto'snto shame. She stared at the shorter man, trying to place him, and when shencouldn't her gaze went back up to the black man. They'd both stopped dead in their tracks upon seeing her and she took thatnopportunity to climb out of her place and walk over to them. Squinting up at the tall man, \"Donny?\" Something in his face lit up and he picked her up and twirled her around.n\"You *do* remember!\" She leaned in close to him and squeezed her armsnaround his neck the way she had when she was younger. When he finally setnher down, she politely turned her attention to the other man. \"You must be Atley.\" He nodded quietly and her eyes widened. \"Please tell me you can talk. I cannonly take one Sphinx.\" Everyone laughed, Sphinx even smiled and Atley smiled. \"You must be SagenRaines.\" She shrugged a slim shoulder. \"So everyone keeps telling me.\" \"You doubt it?\" Her expressive eyes glanced at him before she folded her arms defensivelynand mumbled, \"I don't know what to think anymore.\" A hush filled the room and Atley put his hand on her shoulder, steering hernout the way he and Donny had come in to get some air. and to talk. Which left the rest of them with the image of Sage's expression and hownmuch of her mother she had in her. * * * \"So what's this all about, then? Seems to me like you've got a goodnhead on you shoulders-you seem to know who you are.\" Sage breathed in the crisp night air and watched the moonlight ripple in anpuddle at her feet. \"I thought I knew. But everyone I've met had *that*nreaction to me tonight and I feel like I've missed the joke. Who was she?\" Even though he knew who she was talking about, he needed time to gather anresponse. \"Who was who, darlin'?\" Something flickered in those eyes of hers and he recognized it asnirritation. \"The person I remind everyone of. Who was she?\" Sighing, Atley reached into his pocket for a cigarette and lighter. Hisnhands shook slightly, but she didn't notice. Inwardly, he wondered if henhad the right to tell her this; if Memphis had wanted her to know, he wouldnhave told her by now, for sure, and then he wondered how the job ofndisclosing bad news had fallen to him. First Kip, now his niece. \"She was your mother.\" He answered simply, and blew out a stream ofnsmoke, watching her reaction. \"You knew my mother?\" Atley nodded. \"We all did. She used to be one of us.\" He didn't expand onnwhatever they were, and she didn't ask. She was still too busy trying tonabsorb the facts, as things clicked into place. \"That's why he hates me so much, isn't it?\" \"Who?\" \"My father.\" She laughed bitterly. \"Because I look like her. And-\"nShe broke off as her throat closed with emotion. He put his arm around her comfortingly and she reluctantly rested her headnon his shoulder. \"I'm sure he doesn't *hate* you, Sage. He's your father.nNo parent could ever hate their child.\" Sage lifted her head briefly and sent a chilling look down his spine. \"Thennyou obviously haven't seen him in action. He won't look at me unless he hasnto, and he certainly didn't raise me. 'Dad' is merely a title, because ifnyou want to know what's really been going on, Kip and Tumbler have takenncare of me since I was five. I guess that's when I started looking likenher.\" Atley wisely remained silent, letting her have her time to get used to theninformation that had been dumped on her. \"You want to know something pathetic?\" He looked down at her. \"What's that?\" She looked away, her eyes locking onto the black-covered car that she'dnseen before, and absorbing the familiarity of it. \"I don't even know hernname.\" Atley cursed before he could stop it and she nodded. \"I know.\" By his figuring, he could at least give her that. There was no harm innletting a daughter know her mother's name, right? \"Her name was Sara.\" \"Just Sara?\" She asked, fishing for a last name. For now that would have to be enough. \"Just. Sara.\" He knew it was badnlying to her, that she'd been lied to enough her entire life and she morenthan deserved some truth, but that was a line he wasn't sure he couldncross. Things were obviously bad between Memphis and his daughter now, andntelling her more would only make it worse. Plus, it wasn't his decision tonmake. If she was anything like her mother, and it was unquestionable thatnshe was, then she was going to attack Memphis with all the determination ofna bank robber, demanding answers. But it felt weird. Calling her by her given name instead of the one she'dnresponded to for all those years. He wondered where she was now and whatnshe was doing; the rumor among the group was that she was dead. But he knewnher and he knew that she wouldn't allow anything as mundane as death tonhappen to her. She was probably out there, lurking, just waiting to makenher entrance into their world again. \"She's dead.\" Sage mentioned abruptly and he had his answer. \"Do you believe that?\" he asked, carefully keeping the speculatoryntone to himself. With an effort, she pulled herself together and looked him in the eye.n\"*No.*\" He saw her shutting down and he knew he had to stop it some way. \"Why?\" \"Why not?\" She shrugged. \"He's lied to me about everything else. Whynwouldn't he lie about this?\" \"Why would he?\" Atley countered calmly. This made her pause and some of the fire went out of her eyes. Possiblenthoughts ran through her mind until she settled on one that had the greennin her eyes up and blazing. \"Because he was ashamed of rejection.\" And that pretty much hit the nail on the head. Memphis never hid fromnanything unless he was uncomfortable with it. It was unsettling how muchnshe looked like her mother just then, with the fire in her eyes and thendead-on depiction of her father. \"She loved him.\" He offered quietly, hoping to assuage some of thenanger towards her father. \"Then why did she leave him?\" She retorted, and it occurred to himnthat the anger might not be directed at Memphis at all. * * * \"I can't find her.\" Tumbler looked at Kip. \"We'll find her.\" \"Tumbler, we've been up and down these streets for the past twonhours. She's not here, and she's not at home. She's missing, and we'rengoing to have to tell Memphis.\" \"Maybe she's at a friend's house?\" \"She would answer her cell.\" \"What if it's dead? Or broken?\" \"She would have called to let me know.\" The bulkier man rested in the soft leather seat of Kip's Porsche. \"I'm outnof answers.\" \"Good.\" Tumbler rolled his eyes. \"You're such a drama queen.\" Kip turned to him with angry eyes. \"No, I'm not a drama queen, I'm justnworried that my 16-year-old niece is out missing, or lying dead in a ditchnsomewhere. I'm also worried that if her father finds out she's gone, he'sngoing to do something stupid and let people know that we're back in townnbefore we're ready.\" Startling them out of their misery was the sharp trill of Kip's cell phone.nCaller ID showed it was Memphis and he looked out the window stubbornly. Itnrang a few more times and then stopped, only to pick up again, on Tumbler'snphone. He glanced at Kip, who nodded ever so slightly and answered the phone.n\"Hello?\" \"Do you know where Kip is?\" \"Yeah,\" he stared at his friend, replying vague to stall for time. \"Good. Do you know where my daughter is?\" Just then, Kip's phone rang again and they jumped. The caller ID wasnunavailable and they could imagine all-too clearly what could be on thenother end. It rang promisingly once more and before the note could end, Kipnhad it opened and answered. \"Hello?\" Memphis repeated in Tumbler's ear, \"Do you know where Sage is?\" But Tumblernwas too focused on the color draining out of Kip's face and seeing himnswallow convulsively. \"I'm gonna have to call you back,\" he promised Memphis, closing thenphone against his protests and watching as Kip ended his own call andnstarted to turn the car around. \"Was that her?\" Kip took a deep breath. \"Not exactly.\" \"It wasn't a kidnapper, right? No one kidnapped her?\" \"It wasn't a kidnapper.\" Tumbler waited for more, but that was all he wanted to share. Then hennoticed they were driving on the outskirts of town and got confused. \"Dude,nwhere are we going?\" It was a full minute before Kip answered him; Tumbler counted. \"To Otto's.nMirror picked her up on the way home from school and brought her there.\" * * * I am such a devious little writer-person. Stop me. About the whole Sage/Jesse storyline. don't rule that out just yet. We'renlaying down the groundwork for this and so we'll get back to that innchapter 4 or 5.[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 (Serenity_Sea@yahoo.com) * ~ * ~ * ~ * Memphis stared down at his cell phone in shock. Tumbler had just hung up onnhim. Sage was MIA and Kip wasn't taking his calls. Something was up. He tried Kip's cell once more and was rewarded with an answer this time.n\"Where are you?\" The pause on the other end was lengthy enough to make him worry. \"On ournway to pick Sage up.\" \"You know where she is?\" \"Sure. She's at. a friend's.\" There was something incredibly crypticnabout that sentence, but before he could question it, Kip had said goodbyenand hung up. Things were sort of a blur after that. He remembered getting in the car,nturning on the ignition, and pulling out of the parking lot. And then he was on autopilot, his body knowing what his brain was refusingnto register. * * * \"When we get there, I'm going to beat her.\" Tumbler winced sympathetically, knowing exactly what she in for. \"Maybe younshouldn't do that.\" The anger in his eyes was palpable now. \"Oh no, I'm absolutely going to donthat. She deserves a hell of a lot worse for ending up where she is now andngetting into a car with a stranger. *What the hell was she thinking?*\" \"Mirror's not a stranger,\" Tumbler interjected quietly. Kip shook his head. \"He is to her. She never met him. Donny, Otto-hell,neven Atley, I could see, but Mirror? The girl had no brains left in hernhead.\" They were silent for the rest of the drive; words would only make thingsnworse and Kip needed all his energy to remember how to get to Otto's. Itnhad been over ten years since he'd last seen the man and even longer sincenhe'd visited the garage. When Memphis had talked about making occasionalnvisits to Otto's, he'd immediately turned him down, knowing that as much asnhe loved Sage, if he went back, he'd stay. He only hoped that he wouldn't get sucked back in now. * * * Sage watched as Toby put the phone down quietly. \"He's on his way.\" Theynhad hoped, by having Toby, the most mild member in the group make the call,nthat Kip would take it easier and calm down a bit. But she knew better. She rolled her eyes, \"Great.\" Atley put his hand on her shoulder and shensighed. \"He's going to be furious.\" When no one said anything, she lookednaccusingly at Mirror Man. \"He is, isn't he?\" Mirror looked at Otto for guidance, but he shrugged him off and gave him anlook that was clearly meant to say, 'hey, this one's all yours.' \"Yeah,\" henadmitted. \"But that's only if he remembers how to get here.\" \"What do you mean?\" Sage was confused. If Kip had spent as much timenhere as she thought he had - and that was a great deal of his life - thennthere should be no problem. \"He's been here before.\" Otto cleared his throat finally, saving Mirror Man from furtherninterrogation. \"Kip hasn't been here in a long time, Sage. And in case younhaven't noticed, we're not exactly in the most accessible location.\" A snort came from Freb as he took a swig of beer. \"Hell, we're in thenfreakin' boonies, man!\" Donny shook his head painfully and stared at him a second before smackingnhim upside the head. \"Didn't I teach you to think before you open yournmouth?\" Freb stuttered a bit and looked bashful when he turned his face back up tonmeet Sage's. \"Sorry.\" She smiled easily. \"It's okay. I think we're all just a bit nervous aboutnthem getting here and-\" The slamming of car doors and a very loud argument that traveled clearlynthrough the windows from the outside cut off the rest of her comment. \"I told you to take that left, man, but you didn't want to listen.\" \"Hey!\" That was Kip and she could tell he was more than annoyed. Thenmen in her family never seemed to deal well with getting lost. \"I got usnhere, didn't I?\" Loud footsteps could be heard for several moments and then stopped. \"Should we knock?\" Tumbler asked, his voice muffled by his closenproximity to the door. Inside, Donny rolled his eyes and looked heavenward. Some things nevernchanged. Sage giggled. \"Did we ever knock?\" Kip shot back, shoving the door open. They busied themselves with getting the door closed quickly - 'apparently,'nOtto thought, 'old habits died hard' - and because of that, everyone insidengot a chance to see them first. When they turned around, though, the effect was complete, and everyone wasnsilent. \"My god. You've turned into a bunch of sissies.\" Sphinx, who was thenfirst to recover, spoke in his clear, accented voice. Sage's eyes grew wide and she along with everyone else, turned to look atnthe large man. He shrugged and closed his mouth, making it clear that henwasn't going to contribute any more. For the next few minutes, no one said a word. Mirror had taken off hisnglasses for the first time in years to rub them and stare at Sphinxnintensely. Sage saw her uncle and Tumbler shed about 10 years of theirnlives, and watched as they regressed before her very eyes. Kip scuffed his shoe back and forth and chuckled nervously. \"Wh-What do younmean, Sphinx?\" Mirror looked over and then tossed a glance at Sphinx. \"What he means isnthat you're dressin' like some trussed up preppy boy from the 'burbs. Whatnhappened to the hair, the beard, the coolness? Where'd it go, man?\" Tumbler rolled his eyes self-consciously and a small anxious titter escapednhim as he tried to formulate a response that would let them know he wasnstill inside the cleaned-up looking young man. \"Maybe I can answer that for you.\" A new voice called from the door,ndemanding their attention. * * * Chapter 5 is also posted.[Chapter 6] Chapter 5n(Serenity_Sea@yahoo.com) * ~ * ~ * ~ * Sage froze where she was and her eyes scrunched closed. She cursedninaudibly, feeling that gaze on her even though her back was turned. Kip shoved Tumbler accusingly. \"I thought you locked the door!\" \"I did, I swear!\" The tall man dressed in black, who stood comfortably at the door, pullednsomething thin and silver out of his coat pocket briefly. \"You really thinknthat lock was going to keep me out?\" He fished something silver out of hisnpocket and tossed it to Tumbler, who caught it reflexively. \"Otto gave me ankey.\" His dark blue eyes scanned the room. \"But I honestly thought younwould have made better time getting here. Where is she?\" Drawing in a breath and praying for strength, Sage forced herself to turnnon the stairs and face the newcomer. \"Hi, Dad.\" Memphis Raines stared at his daughter, taking in the way she was standing,narms braced on the railings of the stairs, leaning slightly forward andnlooking as if she'd been caught with her hand in the cookie jar. If therenwere ever a time she reminded him more of *her*, he'd have been dammed tonremember it now. Sometimes it took everything he had to remember that shenwas not her mother and it would therefore be wrong to take out what he wasnfeeling on her. It took some effort, but he finally managed to speaknwithout sounding bitter. \"Ho-How did you get here?\" She came down the steps slowly, just the way her mother always had -npausing to rest one foot on each rung as she descended, enjoying the noisenit made. \"Mirror Man picked me up. I was lost in the center of town. He had menget in the car and we ended up here.\" His eyes closed slowly, trying to hold back his temper. Right now, he wasnhaving no problem keeping mother and daughter separate. Even *she* hadn'tnbeen that stupid. Sage liked to pass herself off as being savvy, and fornthe most part, she was. But there was a certain innocence to her thatnseemed to carry itself well into her teenage years. \"And before you say anything,\" she held a hand up and walked the restnof the distance to where her father was standing, \"He didn't force me tonget in the car,\" her right hand dipped behind her back and she crossed hernfingers tightly, in clear view of everyone else, \"and I could have gottennout at any time.\" He nodded, thinking it over. \"Why didn't you answer your cell phone?\" Otto stepped between the two, momentarily distracting Memphis from hisndaughter. \"I think I can answer that, Memphis. You see, cell phone servicenis not what it used to be out here and, well,\" he paused awkwardly as Sagengot the picture and handed her phone over. \"See for yourself.\" Only one of the five little bullets was displayed on her phone, though itndid show several missed calls from Kip and Tumbler around 4 o'clock. \"Fairnenough.\" He saw Sage trying to tiptoe away and Otto saw the determined setnin Memphis' jaw. \"Sage. Get your things. We're going home.\" Her jaw dropped open in disbelief. \"You've got to be kidding me. I haven'tnseen Uncle Otto in years. I'm not leaving yet.\" \"*Sage*. Your things.\" When she didn't move, he firmly added,n\"*NOW*.\" Sage swept through the rows of cars and back up the stairs where her jacketnand book bag rested. Somewhere between reunions and the phone call, Mirrornhad retrieved her things and brought them up to the loft so she could getnsome work done while they tried to figure out what to do with her. Hidden from view, her hand stilled on the bag as a devious plan crept intonher mind. She reached inside the bag and pulled out her English notebook.nIt was her most important notebook, and she would need it later. But fornnow, it would serve as a way to return to the place where she felt at homenand strangely alone at the same time. With any luck, she could at leastnfind out more about her mother and forge a friendship with people who, innher opinion, should have been in her life all along. \"Sage?\" Memphis called from below. \"Coming,\" she replied, taking a pen and scribbling a hasty note on anblank piece of paper. She covered the sound of her ripping out the page bynconfirming that she was coming again, and left it in fairly plain sight fornwhoever came up to the loft next. Memphis did not so much as say hello to his old crew, and his eyes sweptnover Kip's friends as if they weren't even there. \"Let's go.\" He placed anrigid hand on Sage's shoulder and walked her out of Otto's. Otto moved as if to go after them, and Kip, who had watched the wholenencounter with a sort of bored interest, put his arm, palm up, to stop him.n\"No, don't. She'll be back. And she's going to chew him a new one by thentime they get home.\" The older man had difficulty restraining himself, but muttered somethingndarkly and left the room. Kip and Tumbler turned to face the remaining crew. \"Hey guys.\" Silence once again reigned in the garage until Mirror Man came boundingnforward and grabbed them both in a tight hug. Toby and Freb followed soonnafter, and even Donny got in on the action. Sphinx and Atley were curiously missing, and Kip absently wondered wherenthey went. Then Mirror was dragging him in the back for some pizza and tonshow off the newest cars they were revamping to Tumbler and it was out ofnhis mind. * * * \"You know,\" Atley sighed, exhaling a strong steam of smoke as henwatched Memphis' black Acura pull away from the lot and onto the muddy backnroads, \"I'd forgotten what a stubborn sonofabitch he was.\" Sphinx's teeth gleamed in the moonlight and Atley knew he wasn't out ofnline by continuing, \"But you would have thought he'd want his kid to knownabout her past. If for no other reason for her not to repeat it.\" A longndrag on the cigarette and he was careful to ground it firmly beneath hisnshoes. With a garage full of gasoline, you could never be too safe. \"She'sn16; almost 17. She gets her license in another month.\" The Sphinx grunted his acknowledgement. \"Ten bucks the first place she comes is here.\" Atley turned on his heel and went inside, leaving Sphinx to think aboutnwhat he'd said. \"Hmmm.\" The tall, stoic man stared out into the distance, until hencouldn't see the red of his former crew leader's taillights anymore. Henstayed out a few more minutes for good measure and allowed his thoughts tondrift to the girl's mother. She had been incredible, and a near-perfectnmatch for Memphis. (Even though she swore she was 'flawed.') Without her,nhe was a bitter, stiff-necked man who couldn't even allow his daughter hernhappiness. When she'd left, she'd left a whole in everyone's heart. That was just hernway. She sort of attached herself to everything, stuck a claim on one partnof you or another, and then left you high and dry when the wind changed andnshe decided to move elsewhere. The thing was, she never moved far. And he knew she was alive. Sphinx reached into his pocket and pulled out a letter, reading it in thenbright moonlight. Up until this evening, he hadn't dared to open it. Thenname was unfamiliar, but the handwriting wasn't. He had an all-too clearnidea what was on the inside of the envelope. He sighed deeply, finished reading, and tucked the letter back in hisnpocket. Oh yes. She was alive. * * * \"What were you thinking? You didn't even know who Mirror Man was! Youngot into a car *with a stranger*.\" Memphis shook his head and pushednhimself to focus more than a third of his attention on the road. The lastnthing he needed right now was a ticket. Sage sat in the passenger's seat, looking obstinately out the window. Shenrefused to meet his eyes. Not only had he completely embarrassed her, he'dnpulled her out of a situation where she'd been comfortable. For her to feelncomfortable these days, it required a little more than a smile from someonenand a kind word. But for once, she felt like she among family. And he'dntaken that away. It was unforgivable. \"And then you have Toby call Kip. Did you not want to face himnyourself? Were you worried he was going to ream you out?\" 'Kind of the way you're doing now,' she mentally responded, refusing tonshow emotion. Her father was playing the 'I'm going to see how long itntakes you to get mad' game and she could wait him out as long as necessary.nShe had two cards in her hand that she had yet to play and when she usednthem, it was going to be with great relish. For now, she'd just watch tonsee when they were off the major highways. With what she had to say, beingnin a congested area wasn't a good thing. \"Are you going to answer me?\" he demanded and she responded with anlazy look. Memphis bit the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood and tried tonremember how much damage a speeding ticket would do him right now. Hencounted to ten until his mind hurt from the numbness. When he'd turned ontontheir street, he opened his mouth to speak, but Sage cut him off and beatnhim to it. \"Why didn't you tell me Mom's name was Sara?\" Now, Memphis was an extremely skilled driver. He'd been driving since henwas a year or two younger than Sage and performed some extremely evasivenmaneuvers. The thing of it was, her question had caught him so entirely off-nguard, he swerved to the left and nearly took out the neighbors' trashcans.nWith shaky hands, he pulled over and turned off the car. He turned to look at her. \"*What*?\" She returned the look. \"Mom. Her name was Sara. Why didn't you tell me?\" \"Because I didn't think it was necessary.\" Sage rolled her eyes sonsharply he thought they might fall out of her head. \"Who told you?\" \"I'm not a rat,\" she retorted, leaned over, and started the car backnup herself. Memphis watched her a bit longer and she evenly sent back a look of her ownnuntil he put the car into gear and drove the remaining distance home. Before he could say anything to her, she'd grabbed her bag and had unlockednthe front door. He exited the car as well, running a hand over the smoothnblack paint, and wondered how he'd gone from a car that was older than henwas to one younger than his daughter. It drove beautifully. But it wasn't Eleanor. He sighed and went inside to fix himself a cup of coffee. For the next fewnhours, he was lost in paperwork, looking over Sage's grades, and wonderingnwhat type of car he would get her. Kip said she'd been a simply awful driver when they started out. She'd beennpainfully bad. But then, after a week or so, the Raines genes kicked in andnshe had driven the test car - a 10-year-old brown Oldsmobile - like it wasna sports car. She wasn't doing the fancy stuff - the 180's and 360's andnreverses at 70 MPH - but she sure as hell could drive. He had even let hernloose with his beloved silver Porsche, and that was the highest form ofnpraise she could ever get from him. Memphis glanced at the clock and rubbed a hand over his face. It was timenfor bed. He turned off the lights and knew that he didn't need to leave any on fornhis younger brother. Kip wouldn't be coming home tonight. The stairs werendark and he had more than half a mind to leave it that way, and headnstraight for his room at the end of the hall. And he'd hate himself in thenmorning. He already hated himself for not even saying hello to the guys,nbut if he'd shown any sort of interest in rekindling what once was, Sagenwould have caught onto that in a heartbeat, and snatched the chance to-tondo whatever it was she wound up doing. He pushed open the door to her room gently, smiling when it didn't squeak,nas was sometimes the tendency. Sage was stretched out on her bed, with hernarms and legs flung to the sides. She hadn't changed out of her schoolnclothes, though her shoes were off at the foot of the bed, and Memphisnsmiled when he saw her favorite stuffed toy - a red Volkswagen Beatle -nclutched tightly in her right arm. Even at 16, you weren't too old to have something to cuddle with - in spitenof it being over 10 years old; the red was no longer red but a dull, andnconsiderably lightened cherry color - or too old to have your dad tuck youninto bed. Memphis gathered her close with one arm and expertly turned back her sheetsnwith the other. He settled her in and she turned to rest on her side, hairnfanning out on the white sheets and looking somewhat like. *him*, for once.nThe unyielding set to her jaw while the rest of her features were softenednin sleep was undeniably something that she got from him. He chuckled at the irony - 16 years after he'd shut her out of his life, henwas realizing just how much he wanted to be a part of hers - and ran a handnthrough the thick hair that was all her mother's. \"I love you, Sage.\" Memphis leaned down and kissed her on thenforehead. She mumbled something in her sleep and he smiled tenderly. *She'd* alwaysnloved her sleep too, and hated when he woke her up for one reason ornanother. Unfortunately, Kip loved sleep as well, so she had the sleep genenfrom both sides of her family this time. As he closed the door on his slumbering daughter, he vowed to do whatevernit took to forge a strong relationship with her. Everything but bring her to Otto. * * * The morning, when Sage woke up, the sun was shining on the door across fromnher bed. This stuck her as odd, because when her alarm woke her up, the sunnusually wasn't even out. Warily, she turned over on her side to see hernalarm clock. '8:02' She cursed. First period had begun nearly an hour ago. With a new sense ofnurgency, she rose from the bed, tossed the sheets to the top and spared ansecond to pull them down while reaching for the nearest pair of jeans. The jeans she was now jumping into were black and feeling melancholy, shenreached for her nearest black shirt. It was thin, and fitted, and she wouldnnormally have paired it with something more. well, at least something morencolorful. But this morning, she wasn't in the best mood and color was thenleast of her priorities. Halfheartedly, she grabbed her bag and headed for the bathroom, then thenstairs. Nothing, however, could have prepared her for what awaited in thenkitchen. \"Good morning, sweetheart,\" Memphis said, never taking his eyes offnthe papers her was reading. And so the morning got weirder. \"Kip didn't come home last night, so I decided I'd let you sleep innand drive you to school when you woke up.\" She tried to run a hand through her damp hair, but felt the gel andnwithdrew quickly. \"Um. okay. I'll just grab a bagel and we can go.\" He turned at the exact moment she reached for her bagel on the counternbehind him. Memphis Raines looked at his daughter and bit back a long string of curses.n\"I've never seen you do your hair that way before.\" Knowing he was referring to the twists that covered her entire head withngel, her lips curved slightly. \"Mirror told me I had the right shaped facenfor it. Would you believe his sister is a hairdresser?\" What he had trouble believing was that Mirror had willingly planted thenidea in his daughter's head. And he had a sister that was a hairdresser? Hendidn't even know Mirror Man *had* a sister. \"Um, well. it's a new look for you.\" She had wrapped the bagel in tinfoil and was tapping her foot impatiently.n\"Yeah, so? I like it.\" He grabbed his keys and she pushed out the door ahead of him, getting intonthe unlocked car. \"As long as it makes you happy,\" he mumblednsarcastically. * * * After she had signed in at the main office and gotten everything settled innher locker, the bell rang, signaling the end of second period. This meantnshe had exactly four minutes to get her ass to chemistry, which was on thenother side of the school. Grabbing the thick chem. book that she'd leftnovernight and an equally thick red notebook, she slammed the door shut andnplowed into a black and green varsity football jerseyed chest. \"Hey.\" Sage closed her eyes and stepped away, knowing exactly whom the voicenbelonged to. \"Why aren't you walking away to let me die of embarrassmentnright now?\" Jesse Castleback grinned, revealing a boyishly handsome set of white teeth,na sight that had brought many a cheerleader to their knees. \"You weren't innEnglish this morning,\" he ignored her negative statement, and put a hand onnher shoulder to propel her in the direction of their next class. \"I tooknthe notes for you. Everything okay?\" She cast a gauging clear-eyed look at him, one that usually intimidatednpeople she didn't want to explain herself to - which was pretty often - andnwas slightly disturbed to find that it had no effect on his laughing brownneyes. She sighed and wondered why she was giving into the query, completelynunaware that she was currently the envy of half the cheerleading squad. \"I sort of had a big family reunion type thing yesterday afternschool. it went well, but the talk with my dad after; didn't.\" \"Parents are unpredictable like that, aren't they?\" His eyebrow rose. \"Inthought you'd hung here after school. But if you were here late, how'd younget a ride home?\" She blinked. If he was okay with the fact that he'd just admitted tonwaiting for her, or was at least paying some seriously non-obligatorynattention, then she could be too. \"I, um. I got picked up.\" That wasn't tonsay that it wouldn't require some effort. They had now reached the door of the chem. class. He stopped at hernstatement and put both hands on her shoulders. \"You *what*?\" Sage immediately grew defensive. \"I got a ride with a guy. I knew him,\" shenadded indignantly, pushing his hands away. \"Sort of.\" Jesse stared at her for a long, measuring moment, then sighed, shaking hisnhead. \"You are too much, Raines. You're going to kill me, you know thatnright?\" Involuntarily, she felt the corners of her mouth curve upwards. \"Yeah,nokay.\" The bell rang and they took their seats at the lab desk they shared nearnthe back of the classroom. For the next few minutes, Sage sat quietly andntook studious notes, while the teacher lectured about lab techniques andnthe importance of safety around highly flammable components. About 15 minutes into the lecture, Jesse slouched in his seat and groanednunder his breath. Sage hid a smile; she had begun to understand her partnernand knew that this was his least favorite part of the day. She, on thenother hand, lived for science for some unexplainable reason. Maybe thencontrolled situations appealed to her, since labs could go as planned ornentirely reversed from the expected results. For whatever explanation, thisnwas, without a doubt her favorite class. But when he slouched in his seatnlike that, she knew that paying attention from this point on would be outnof the question. When he was bored, he fidgeted. And when he fidgeted, hendistracted her until she personally stopped him. She gave him about a minute before the foot jiggling began before touchingnhis arm gently. \"Chill. He's almost done, I remember this experiment fromnmy last school.\" He rolled his eyes at her and playfully flicked a strand of her hair. \"Inkinda like this. Where'd you get the idea for it?\" \"Wouldn't you like to know,\" she murmured under her breathe, lookingnfor all the world like she was paying diligent attention, though she wasnreally trying to control her impatience with their still-droning teacher.nThat was the only thing that sucked about switching schools. You sometimesnran the risk of repeating things. A lot. Jesse flicked her hair again. \"The football team's hosting a party thisnFriday night. Wanna come with?\" Finally, the teacher was wrapping up. Unfortunately, he was also alteringnthe experiment. She needed to get these diagrams down; at least one of themnhad to have them the correct procedure down. \"Sure,\" Sage replied,nanswering without really thinking. He grinned and resettled himself in his chair. He knew when she realizednwhat had just happened because her eyes got greener and grew to the size ofnthe beakers resting on shelves around the classroom. \"What?\" She asked loudly, drawing the attention of the class and teacher.nInstantly, she blushed, and ducked her head, letting her long twists covernher cheeks. \"Was there something you disagreed with, Miss Raines?\" Sage shook her head solemnly. \"No, sir.\" Then a mischievous smile twistednher lips and her eyes gleamed. \"Actually,\" the class, who had by now turnednback around, glanced back, \"what if instead of using a control plate withnthe Tobacco Mosaic Virus, we added another form of bacteria and see how itnheld up against that? I think that by using a non-plant bacteria, we wouldnbe able to test its effectiveness on a more stable type of virus.\" Their teacher looked impressed. \"That's a very good idea. While you'rengoing over the procedure, I'll see how I can work that in. Thank you fornyour input, Miss Raines. I hope to be hearing from you more often.\" She exhaled loudly, slumping in her seat with relief. Jesse cleared hisnthroat and she glanced at him to see him grinning at her. \"Don't speak. Injust used up the reserves of my brain power and I need to regenerate.\" He held his hands up innocently. \"I wasn't saying a word.\" Sage glared at him. \"Sure you weren't.\" She reached for her pen and triednto go over the procedure quietly, but this proved hopeless as her mind wasnotherwise occupied with the fact that she had just accepted what could benjustifiably called by any stretch of the imagination - a date. The pen thatnhad been hovering over her notebook slammed down as she turned to look atnhim. \"What did you just rope me into, Castleback?\" Jesse smiled disarmingly. \"Would I rope you into anything without yournconsent first?\" Her glare hardened, and he continued, \"You are justnaccompanying me to a small party with a few friends on Friday night. Andndon't think you can back out, because you already accepted and I will bendevastated if I have to find another date. Not to mention, bored sillynbecause all the good-looking girls in this school have nothing but airnbetween their heads and yet you defy that, for somehow I manage to have anstimulating conversation with you no matter what.\" When she didn't react,nhe added, \"That was a compliment, you know.\" Now she had to smile at him. \"I know. I just don't want to ruin yournevening. I'm not going to be a different person from who I am now, so justnbe prepared for that. Fitting in with the cheering squad isn't really mynthing. You still sure you want me to go? There may be dirty looks shot tonthe rah-rah chicks if they start to mutter things under their breath.\" He slipped an arm around her shoulder easily, using his free hand to pushnaway their notes while laughing at her probably dead-on prediction. \"If Inhad wanted anyone else, I would have asked them. Don't you want to shake upnthe complacency of this town anyway?\" Her eyes sparkled and he had hisnanswer. \"Besides. Can I help it if I don't want you wandering around thenstreets of Long Beach unaccompanied?\" Sage recalled his earlier outburst. \"Why were you so freaked, anyway?\" Jesse shook his head slowly, almost as if mocking himself. \"It probably hasnsomething to do with the fact that my father's a police officer.\" * * * I think that is quite possibly the longest chapter so far. It more thannmakes up for chapter four, though you all should consider yourselves luckynthat you were granted another 2-chapter update. The chemistry between Jesse and our girl Sage is starting to take a turnnfor the better. She has no idea just how deep this boy has fallen. And whynshould she? No one ever paid her much attention before. But for somenreason, little Castleback has fallen for the dark, mysteriously smartnRaines daughter. I can't wait to see where it leads.[Chapter 7] Life is Like A Bowl Of Cherries Chapter 6[Chapter 8] Life is Like A Bowl Of Cherries | Chapter 7 - - - - - \"So how did it go last night?\" Sage wordlessly turned to him. Then she looked back out the window. \"Ouch. That good, huh?\" Sighing heavily, she reached down into her bag and scribbled on a piece ofnpaper. She then handed it to him and closed her eyes. 'Tired. Stop. Talking. Please.' He grinned and drove the rest of the way in silence. * * * Sage woke up to the rich scent of coffee. She opened her eyes and nearlynjumped out of her skin. There was a giant cup hovering in front of her face. She blinked andnfollowed the hand connected to the cup. \"Wake up, Sleepyhead.\" Jesse was crouched beside her, eyes dancing as he smiled widely. Shencouldn't stop from replying in turn as she gratefully accepted thencaffeine. \"How long was I out for?\" \"About twenty minutes,\" he replied, watching as her brain woke up. Itnwas almost as if clouds literally cleared from her eyes and he swore hencould see the gears turning as she thought. \"We've got 10 minutes beforenhomeroom. Thought I'd jumpstart your morning a bit. Plus-I'm bribing you.\" \"Oh?\" A wisp of a smile played on her lips as she drank. For the first time all morning, he took his gaze off her. Sage wouldnremember it later as one of the few times she'd ever seen his confidencenfalter. \"Sage. I don't want to pressure you into anything. And I don't wantnyou to feel obligated to be with me.\" Her brow rose. \"Castleback, where are you going with this?\" \"Why don't you call me Jesse?\" He asked abruptly, avoiding hernquestion and just as skillfully asking one of his own. Sage blinked. \"I don't know. You always call me Raines.\" He slowly shook his head. \"Not anymore.\" Inwardly taking a deep breath, she lifted her hand to his cheek and lockedndirectly in his eyes. \"Jesse.\" A tiny grin appeared on his lips and shenfelt his cheek move under her hand. \"What do you want form me?\" They stayed like that for what seemed like hours. She waited for him tonmake a move; to step forward or pull back. \"Yo, Castle-back!\" Startled, Sage jumped slightly and would have pulled away, if he hadn'tnbeen holding her hand in place. \"Don't move,\" he ordered, his voicendistractingly low, sending shivers down her back. She felt like there was anten-ton weight on her chest as he ignored his friend and gently tucked anstrand of hair behind her ear. \"The ball, Sage,\" he finally moved to standnup, pulling her out of the car, \"is in your court.\" Sage leaned up on her tiptoes and kissed the precise place her hand hadnbeen moments earlier. \"I'll see you in English. Go talked to your friend.\" Jesse watched her walk away with an inner confidence he noticed from thenfirst day she'd walked in the door. Sage Raines didn't know it just yet,nbut they were a very dangerous combination. * * * Sage didn't allow her muscles to unclench until she was safe inside thengirls' bathroom. It was the one place Jesse couldn't follow her. Hopefully. Though, judging from the present set of girls making more use thannnecessary of the mirrors, they probably wouldn't object too much. Needing to blend in so as not to further rouse their suspicious, Sagenleaned forward and examined her eyes in the mirror. They looked weary,nlacking the familiar silver luster she'd grown accustomed to over thencourse of the past 16 years, and she sighed. How had she gone from beingnhappily adrift, passing her classes, content to write her essays and benquietly ignored, to this? This was scary. Everything had changed, and she wasn't sure how she feltnabout it. Here, she wanted to not only excel in her classes, butnparticipate all the time. Speaking up would have been unheard of two monthsnago-but here. Of course, it didn't hurt that Jesse was in nearly all of hernclasses. She found that she met his eyes more often than not, that thencomfort level between them was undeniably present and equallynunexplainable, but that she really wouldn't have it any other way. She was very, very close to falling in love with him. And Sage Raines didn't let anyone into her heart without a fight. * * * English was, surprisingly uneventful. She watched from her seat as Jessenwalked in the door and immediately locked eyes. He winked and took his seatnbehind her. All throughout the class, she could feel his eyes burning intonher, but it wasn't until Ms. Nichols was handing out the homework that shencould look back at him. \"What's going on?\" He shrugged. \"Nothing.\" Her brow arched and the look she gave him was priceless. \"Tell you after class.\" She sensed he wasn't yet finished and wasnproved right when he tapped her nose and added, \"Turn around.\" Sage rolled her eyes and tried to focus until the end of the period. Shenwas all but ready to jump out of her skin when she heard her name beingncalled. Ms. Nichols was looking at her expectantly. An elbow jabbed into her fromnbehind. \"Um, yes?\" A smirk seemed to wavering on their teacher's lips. \"Can I talk to you forna minute?\" Sage nodded and headed to the desk, Jesse trailed not far behind. The smirkngrew full-fledged when Ms. Nichols noticed his actions. \"Alone,\" she added,ngiving her student a reproving look. He took the hint, grabbed the books out of her arms and headed out thendoor. \"Yes?\" The older woman rose from her chair. \"I have a conference scheduled at thenend of the week with your father,\" she kept her eyes on Sage's face,n\"apparently, our secretaries have gotten to know each other quite well bynnow.\" Sage nodded distractedly. \"Right.\" Then she realized her teacher wasnwaiting for a reply. \"Oh-so, right, secretaries. I didn't know teachers gotntheir own secretaries.\" The brunette gave her an odd look. \"I just want to stress upon you thenimportance of this conference. Your dad needs to be there. Given his tracknrecord-\" Sage snapped to attention. \"-Whoa! What do you mean, his track record? Whatnare you talking about?\" Ms. Nichols looked taken aback at her sudden vehemence. \"The past few timesnI've tried to get in touch with him,\" she spoke slowly, her brows raised innwarning, \"he has neglected to return the message.\" The teen shook her head slightly. \"No. He got the message. He just doesn'tncare.\" Fleetingly, she thought of her car, and the brief time they'd spentnlast night, but angrily brushed it aside. \"With all due respect, Ms.nNichols, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but don't be shocked if mynfather doesn't show on Friday. I won't.\" She'd had enough experience reading difficult students before Sage, butnthere were times when it seemed the young woman had all the personality andnemotion of a black hole. Obviously, the relationship between father andndaughter was strained, but she had no idea it was quite so troubled. And itnappeared that only Sage was the one allowed to criticize her father. Heavennhelp the next one who spoke badly of Randall Raines. She might notnacknowledge it, but there was no one on earth Sage loved more than hernfather. She glared defiantly back at her and probably would have continued glaringnif a slight buzz hadn't startled them both out of their standoff. Sage letnone more venomous look at her before retrieving her cell phone. 'Hey. What's going on? Chem's lonely w/o you. J.' Ms. Nichols watched as Sage's entire face transformed at what appeared tonbe a text message from someone important. \"How did he get this number?\" she whispered under her breath, staringnat her phone incredulously, halfheartedly returning her attention to hernteacher. \"Someone important?\" As if she had personally commanded it, she watched as Sage's defensivenwalls went up. \"Doesn't matter. Are we through? I'm going to be late fornChemistry and my partner-\" a brief smile broke through of its own accord, \"-ndoesn't take very legible notes.\" 'If he takes them at all,' she thoughtnsarcastically. They both knew that her disrespectful attitude and demeanor was enough tonget written up-not to mention, having a phone on during school hours wasnagainst school policy. 'At least she's got guts.' An almost devious smile appeared on Ms. Nicholsnlips. \"Tell you what, Sage. You come with me, and I won't write you up fornyou behavior and that phone. I'm sure Mr. Castleback will manage innChemistry without you.\" Sage's jaw dropped slightly, though whether from correctly guessing thenmystery caller's identity or the fact that she wasn't getting written up,nshe wasn't sure. She tried to regain her composure. \"Where?\" \"Does it matter? You're getting out of class. With a *teacher*. It'snconsidered excused.\" She gave her a bland look, \"Unless you'd prefernspending this Friday in detention?\" \"You wouldn't.\" \"Try me.\" Her dark eyes glittered and Sage decided she didn't want tonpush the issue any further. That didn't stop her from making one last attempt at escape, though. \"Whatnis it with people and wanting me to go places with them? Do I have 'kidnapnme' written on my forehead?\" Ms. Nichols unexpectedly stopped in the process of locking the classroomndoor. \"What do you mean?\" There was a look in her eyes Sage couldn't identify, and wasn't sure shenwanted to. \"It's nothing. Really.\" It was eerie, the way this woman's eyesnbore into her and made her want to blurt out what had happened the past fewndays. Saving her-or damning her, depending on your point of view-was the timelynarrival of a certain guidance counselor. \"Ms. Raines. Astraea. What have we here?\" The two turned to look at Ms. Ward and she was momentarily taken aback bynthe matching expression on their faces. \"None of your concern, *Sarah*,\" and Sage was shocked at the malicenin her teacher's voice, \"so why don't you stay out of matters that don'tnconcern you.\" The counselor's lips twisted. \"Whatever you say. Does Ms. Raines' fathernknow you're pulling her out of class so unexpectedly?\" \"Of course he does,\" she confidently replied, sneaking a glance atnSage, willing her to agree. \"I always run my plans by him first.\" \"Always?\" Her tone of voice made the hair stand up on the back ofnSage's neck. Ms. Nichols stiffened and replied in a dangerously low voice, \"*Always*.\" The blonde sniffed disdainfully as if she'd suddenly became aware that itnwas two against one. \"Please be careful with Ms. Raines. She has a test innTrig that I'm sure she won't want to miss.\" The cold fire in Sage's eyes was unmistakable as she stepped in between thentwo teachers. \"I don't know what your deal is with my father, or why younsuddenly know everything about me, but I am going to ask you-nicely-ton*back the hell off*. This behavior crosses the line of guidance counselornand fits very nicely into *stalker*. I would appreciate if you kept yournopinions to yourself and bring any issues you have with my dad to himnpersonally. I'm sure he'd love to meet you.\" Ms. Ward paled. \"That won't be necessary. I apologize for freaking younout.\" \"Accepted. If you'll excuse us?\" Sage brushed past her counselor andnout the door, automatically heading for the teacher lot. It wasn't untilnshe felt a hand on her shoulder that she stopped and turned to look intonthe eyes of her companion. Before she could speak, Sage held up her hand.n\"I don't know what the hell that was, but you had better do some explainingnand fast-because Ms. Ward wasn't the only one crossing the line backnthere.\" She bit her lip to keep from grinning, \"Astraea.\" She acknowledged the name with a nod. \"Let's get something to eat first.nAll this cat-fighting had made me hungry.\" When they stopped in front of a black Ferrari convertible, Sage's jawndropped for the second time that day. \"Ms. Nichols, you're kidding.\" She shook her head and tossed the keys to her. \"It's Rae, and get in.\" * * * They ended up at an outdoor bistro just past main street. After orderingnlunch-at Rae's persistence-Sage twirled a breadstick while looking at herncompanion, waiting for her to start talking. \"Can I just say one thing first?\" Sage nodded. \"Do you know whatnyou're getting into with Jesse Castleback? Because while I think he's got angood heart-I'm not so sure the two of you is one of his better ideas.\" \"What makes you think it was his idea?\" Sage asked dryly. \"Because I've known him longer than I've known you-but you remind mena lot like myself when I was younger. Tall, dark and handsome isn't alwaysna picnic.\" Sage sighed and leaned back in the wicker chair. \"I just want you to knownthis whole situation is weird. I don't normally allow myself to snap at twonadults, much less one who wants to take me out to lunch. That having beennsaid. I don't know what's going on with Jesse. Do I think he's cute? No. Henis quite possibly the most handsome boy I've ever met-and charismatic tonboot. But he's a football player. Granted, he's got brains, and whilenthat's unheard of, he seems to be yet another person taking an interest innme, which leads me to believe-\" \"-you're doing something wrong.\" Rae finished for her, trying not tonsmile at her young guest. \"I told you that you remind me of myself. I'mngoing to take a wild guess here, but-judging from what I gathered from yourntranscripts-you got your work done, hung out with the wrong crowd to dispelnany bit of a 'good girl' image, and when you got a little too 'bad girl'nfor comfort, you backed off. Or, in this case, moved to Long Beach.\" Shenleaned on the table and tilted her head. \"Am I right?\" Sage nodded mutely. Rae grinned, tucked back some of her dark hair. \"Thought so. Before I scarenyou *completely* away, let's get into those explanations, okay?\" The server interrupted briefly to set down their salads and while Sage dugninto hers, Rae used the opportunity to speak without interruption. \"What you witnessed back at school was a mutual dislike Sarah-Ms.nWard-and I have for each other. Why she's suddenly obsessed with you andnyour father, I don't know. What I *do* know is that she's hated me from thenfirst day I came to work here, and I don't know why.\" \"Maybe you look like someone she didn't like.\" At her arched look,nSage added, \"What? Trust me, it's more feasible than you think. Really.\" \"You want to talk about it?\" The teen shook her head once. \"Not now. Maybe after you're finishednexplaining.\" Rae rolled her eyes. \"Okay, so, Sarah? She hates me. We've got that. Inpulled you out of school because you looked like you needed a break andnwhile I bet that if I hadn't done it, Jesse would have-he's part of thenproblem, isn't he?\" Sage nodded. \"Thought so. Besides. You didn't reallynwant to take a trig test, did you?\" * * * \"Ah. Sleeping Beauty awakens.\" Kip looked up at his best friend and scowled. \"Shut up, Tumbler. Where'snOtto?\" \"Like I'm going to tell you.\" He must have read something in Kip'sneyes, for he hastily added, \"in his office.\" Kip snagged a mug of coffee-and winced. 'Note to self: Never let Mirrornnear a coffeepot again.' He leaned in the doorframe of the office, lettingnhis gaze wander the shelves. \"You look upset.\" Otto noted, pushing aside the papers on his desknand motioning for Kip to come in and close the door behind him. \"Well, maybe that's because I am.\" He daringly sipped again at thencoffee and somehow resisted spitting it back out. The effort must havenshown on his face, though, for the next thing he knew, he was sitting withna fresh mug of Otto's coffee, in the chair reserved for potential clients. The older man watched him carefully. \"So. What brings you to my office?nShouldn't you be gallivanting about with that old gang of yours?\" Kip shook his head, setting down his mug. \"That's part of the problem. Sagenwas here yesterday, wasn't she?\" Otto nodded silently. \"Who was she with?\"nWhen Otto didn't answer right away, Kip pressed, \"She didn't come bynherself. Who did she come with?\" After a long period of silence, during which Kip was hard-pressed to notnsay anything, Otto finally evasively answered, \"I had Toby do a plate-ncheck.\" Which, given his skill with a computer, and the many years he'd had tonsharpen those skills, should have been a cake job. Even so, Kip couldn'tnkeep from asking, \"And?\" \"The car was registered to a Jesse Castleback.\" He let loose a long string of curses so strident that had Donny, who wasnpassing by, raise a brow and stop in his tracks. Otto waved him on andncontinued to wait out Kip's foul language. When he stopped, apparentlynrunning out of options, he looked utterly defeated. \"How does my niece wind up getting involved with a Castleback?\" Otto examined his paperwork. \"I'm sure the good detective is asking his sonnthe very same thing.\" * * * Roland Castleback was not, as a matter of fact, asking his son what he wasndoing with a Raines. \"Why did Robbie pull me over yesterday after lunch and tell my thatnmy son was speeding down the freeway at precisely 1:47 PM, when my son wasnsupposedly in school, in the middle of a chemistry lab?\" Jesse stared at his father, gauging how much truth to let slip in thenwhopper of a lie he was about to tell. \"Dad. A friend of mine was. sick.nAnd I had to get them away from school before something bad happened.\" Whether from being a cop for over three decades, or knowing his son as wellnas he did, Roland Castleback picked up on two things in his son'snstatement. The use of a non-descriptive pronoun and the evasive end to thenanswer. \"This friend. Is it a girl, by any chance?\" \"Maybe.\" His eyes pinned Jesse down. \"And what kind of trouble was she in?\" \"She wasn't in trouble!\" Jesse protested a little too strongly. \"Or,nat least, I got her out of there before she could be.\" When he noticed thatnhe didn't look very convinced, he added, \"Look, Dad. She's. important tonme. And she wasn't having a very good day.\" \"You know that doesn't excuse the speeding. I don't care who she is.\" 'You would if you knew who her father was.' Jesse thought, immediatelynbanishing the thought from his mind before his dad decided to give him annimpromptu lie test. \"Jesse. Are we clear?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Castleback rolled his shoulders and exhaled loudly. \"Good. Now do you wantnto tell me why I was called to the principal's office?\" * * * Lunch had been fun, and when Sage looked at her watch, she was more thanncertain she'd missed her trig quiz; and that Rae had planned it that way.nIt was weird to think of her favorite teacher as 'Rae,' weirder still tonreplay the morning's events in her mind. Sage though that she was probablynthe only girl in California who could honestly say she had two teachers andna quarterback vying for her attention. Speaking of the quarterback, she looked down at her phone and groaned. \"What's wrong?\" Rae asked, taking her eyes off the road briefly. \"Jesse. left me a few messages.\" \"Oh.\" If more amusement could have been injected into that singlenword, Sage would have been surprised. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Rae snatched the phone out of her hands and kept her knee on the wheel,nsteering with such precision it momentarily left Sage speechless. \"Holyncrap! You have 19 missed calls and 16 new text messages!\" She whistlednadmiringly. \"I'll say this for him; that boy is nothing if not persistent.\" Sage grabbed the wheel before she steered them right into a ditch. \"Watchnthe road! You're going to get us killed, here!\" She kept the phone out of reach but did allow her right hand to regain itsnposition on the wheel. \"So. Are you and Castleback an item?\" She closed her eyes and let her head fall back against the headrestndefeatedly. \"My god, you don't let it go.\" \"Nope.\" Sage then remembered she was driving in a very fast car with a woman whonpreferred a 'Look, ma! No hands!\" approach. Her eyes flew open. \"Hey, wait. These aren't all from him. You've got a number of callsnfrom someone else.\" She grabbed the phone back. \"Great. My dad. And my day is officiallyncomplete.\" \"Your dad called? Give me that-I'm going to make sure he's coming onnFriday.\" \"You are really obsessed about this conference, you know that?\" A pause. \"Well. I don't have many students who come in halfway through thenyear, manage to keep a stellar GPA, single-handedly catch the eye of who isnprobably the most desired boy in the school, and disrespect two teachersnwithin a five-minute period. I'd say that's quite a string ofnaccomplishments.\" When Sage didn't reply for a long time, Rae thought she'd gone too far. \"You forgot the phone. I'm not supposed to have a phone on innschool.\" They shared a glance briefly and started laughing. * * * \"Sarah?\" The blonde looked up from her computer screen. The short secretary--she had personally nicknamed her Glenda--wasnexpectantly waiting at the door. \"Yes? What is it?\" \"I have Mr. Raines on line one for you.\" An evil grin curved her lips. \"Thank you.\" She reached for her phone andndepressed the hold button. \"Mr. Raines? It's Sarah Ward, Sage's guidancencounselor. Good, how you are? Oh no, Sage's fine. I just wanted to know ifnyou were aware of her frequent outings with Astraea Nichols. Ms. Nichols isnher English teacher. Yes, I do believe you have a conference with her thisnFriday.\" She paused and the light in her blue eyes grew chilly. \"Certainly.nI'd love to be there.\" * * * He nearly launched himself off the bed when the phone rang. \"Hello?\" \"Jesse?\" \"Oh, thank god, Sage. I thought you were dead.\" A dry silence greeted him on the other end. He tried again. \"You still there?\" \"Mmm hmm.\" She was clearly trying to keep a cool demeanor. Jesse decided he would shock her. \"Hey Sage?\" \"Yeah?\" He bit back a grin and hoped he could keep his facts straight. \"Today,nafter I was talking to my friend, we wanted to know who had left lipsticknmarks all over my cheek.\" He ignored her gasp of outrage and continued, \"soninstead of trashing your reputation, I just. told him you were myngirlfriend.\" \"You *what*?\" \"Which, I suppose, isn't really a lie, because you *are* a girl--nleast you were last time *I* checked--and we are. technically speaking,nfriends.\" He heard her sigh clearly filtering over the phone lines. \"Castleback?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You are *so* dead.\" \"See you up at quarter to seven.\" * * * She replaced the phone with a lingering smile, running the day's eventsnthrough her mind. All in all, it hadn't gone bad. In fact, it could havenbeen worse. Much worse. Her dad hadn't been home when she'd finally gottennin--Rae had dropped her off--and so she'd pretty much retreated to her roomnuntil it occurred to her that she would probably call Jesse. In some ways,ntheir relationship was kind of weird. She would have had to be blind not tonsee his overprotective attitude, and while it would have normally annoyednher, that yet another man in her life was trying to take care of her, shenfound it didn't bother her as much coming from him. And that probably should have sent up warning flags, but she didn't care. Something, however, wasn't sitting right with her. Some part of the daynjust felt. *off*. Again, she ran the day though her mind, trying tonascertain just what was unsettling her. Another six tries saw herncollapsing on the pillow and admitting defeat. It wasn't until she woke outnof a sound sleep well after everyone sane was asleep in their bed when shenrealized what had troubled her so much. When Ms. Ward had said 'Ms. Raines' in the hallway before, they had bothnturned to face her. * * * Chapter eight is going to be the conference and the party Jesse and Sage gonto. Also, we're going to get to what Ms. Ward's been stirring up. Jeez. 10 pages? This is too much. I think I need to take a break ornsomething. The story has taken a life of its own.

Everything else belongs to their creators. Healing Hands Chapter 1 Essence Morgan closed her eyes as she jogged slowly, intent to enjoy the sun and warmth now that she was able. She'd been cooped in her new home for most of the two weeks she'd been in this city and by God now she was at least going to see something other than drab walls and cardboard boxes. Even if it killed her. Which is the very thought pattern that had made her peel herself away from unpacking and head out this morning . . . well that and Angel was about to climb the walls right beside her. She sighed, looking down as her German Shepherd pranced along in front of her; occasionally tugging at his leash when he would spot or smell something interesting before he'd settle back down. She rolled her eyes. You'd think he was the one who'd had to pack and unpack, transfer jobs and deal with all of the general hassles of moving from the way he was acting. But then again as far as he was concerned, he probably had. His food bowl had moved over four states after all. She shook her head, using her free hand to push her slightly damp light brown hair out of her eyes; glancing around the new area she'd found herself in. So maybe a ten mile radius was a little large for her to take on her first run but she needed to familiarize herself with as much as she could. And in Long Beach she needed to make sure she did it quickly . . . Which is how she'd found herself near the docks and marinas in the warehouse district, taking in all of the older buildings and salt worn architecture. Each new structure was slightly different than the last, the years of grime dirt and graffiti adding to the already chipped and dented siding and the cracked or broken windows to make each seem unique. And even though they were all in various stages of decay or repair she found that she loved comparing them. Chicago had plenty of buildings like these and seeing them made all of this a little easier on her. Actually it made it a lot easier . . . because as soon as she closed her eyes and listened, she heard the one thing that Chicago had lacked severely. Even under the sounds of the city and the wind. She heard the ocean and the marina; she could smell the salt and water on the air . . . she was finally home. Despite how long she'd lived in Chicago–and everything she'd suffered through while she was there–she hadn't really had to look hard for a place to relocate when the world had finally become too much. She been born and raised in California, living and thriving on the west coast until after her fourteenth birthday. When he her parents had been killed in a rather grizzly car accident. She'd gone to live with her older brother Troy after that, moving across the country and trying to build a life for herself as he balanced taking care of her and keeping his blossoming career afloat. She smiled, pride swelling in her chest as she thought about all her brother had accomplished over the past few years. Their parents would be just as proud if not more so . . . but then again how could they be anything but? Troy had done more than okay for himself, working hard to reach a height that his peers had never thought him capable of. Now as a high end attorney he worked with a multibillion dollar conglomerate that kept him flying across the country–and occasionally the world to solve certain international issues with his own brand of skill and charm. And while it meant that she didn't see him much she knew he loved her immensely . . . and that he was only a plane trip away. Essence sighed, slowing down as she and Angel passed close to the Vincent Thomas Bridge. She looked up, taking in the menagerie of concrete and steel in awe before she shook herself and started back on her exploration. But as she moved further into the warehouses and turn offs to the water she couldn't help but wonder if the towering structure was any prettier lit up at night than it was in the day time. She grinned, shaking her head. Probably. She made her way down one of the larger alleys, looking around the old storefronts and garages curiously. Who knew, maybe she could actually find someone to work on her baby down here . . . and if she was lucky she might just happen upon a better second job. She'd always had an interest in cars, even when she was younger. And working in and around garage couldn't possibly be as bad as what she was doing now. Hell it might actually take stress away from her life. She slowed, glancing in the largest free standing garage cautiously; trying to see if anyone was around . . . or if there was anything worth stopping to see. She'd noticed more than a few classics littered around the gated in yard–all in various stages of repair–and she had to admit she was curious to see what else they had. She glanced into the open work bays and noticed there were several men outside, mingling just beyond the doorway. The men laughed and talked with one another, some hassling the others good naturedly as others groused and complained. But as soon as they noticed her all conversation stopped, the members of the group either fading back deeper into the large garage or standing and staring back at her. Essence raised a brow at them–in curiosity and confusion–before she shrugged it off, looking forward and focusing all of her attention on the music blaring from her earbuds as she continued on her way. She rolled her eyes, heading down towards the waterfront as she tried to guide Angel the way she wanted him. But with how restless he was she knew after a lap near the docks she would need to head back. Or she would have even more trouble getting him to follow her. He was a great dog, but when he got bored or tired he had the attention span of a gnat. And she could practically hear her brother's teasing voice in the back of her head, accusing her that he was just like her. She made her way around the marina, looking over the different kinds of boats and ships as they danced across the murky water in the port. And she'd only had to keep Angel from chasing the gulls and pelicans twice before he'd gotten the message and been content to just bark and yip at the flying rats. Eventually her feet led her home, climbing the few steps to her porch as she tried to wrangle both Angel and her keys. Which were stubbornly trying to stay attached to her iPod arm band instead of coming loose like they should. She stepped inside before releasing Angel's leash, leaving him to gallop into the kitchen; where he immediately tried to swim in his water bowl as she made her way upstairs to take a quick shower before going in to work. She sighed, shaking her head at her dog. At least he wasn't small enough to fit in the bowl anymore . . . now that had been a horrific mess to clean up. She sighed, letting her mind turn towards work as she turned the water on; adjusting the temperature before she started shedding her workout clothes. Being a first assistant for a shoe store that didn't give a rat's ass about their employees wasn't as glamorous as other people thought–actually in all honesty it sucked–but it paid well (since she'd worked her way up the proverbial latter and fought hard for all of her raises). Or at least enough for her to get by. So she'd slaved away for what seemed like forever until she finally transferred from Chicago, both her boss and the seemingly never-ending snow wearing on her dangerously thin last few nerves. So now here she was, twenty-three years old in a new town with a fresh start . . . now she just had to make the best of it. After her shower, Essence found herself glancing around her closet; trying to find something suitable to wear to work. She needed something she could move around in and still look professional . . . and that she wouldn't mind being seen in before she went in. Hell at least she didn't have to wear a uniform right? She reached up, trying to push her hair back and out of her face before she reached out to trace one of her better dress shirts. She'd taken the extra time to style her long layers today instead of just braiding it or pulling it back, curling the layers in different angles to make them more noticeable before she'd done her makeup. She glanced around the closet again before shaking her head, grabbing her black leggings and one of her softer black tunic length shirts. The shirt would sit well on her figure, accentuating her waist without being too tight or fitting while the draped kimono styled sleeves bagged just enough to be either casual or dressy. Essence turned, grabbing her grey suede calf-boots before she sank onto the edge of her bed; carefully pulling the square toed riding boots up and onto her legs; taking the time to make sure the leggings were completely tucked all the way around. She went to check her makeup, smoothing her hands over her slightly peachy pink cheeks before she reapplied her clear gloss. She'd found a long time ago that going for a natural look–save the mascara and thin black liner she'd used on her eyes to make them more noticeable–was the easiest way for work. It wasn't too loud or dramatic. And people didn't mistake her for some kind of pampered little princess . . . or a skank. She rolled her eyes, carefully adjusting the diamond briolette articulated dangle and sterling silver heart necklace from her jewelry stand. She knew the diamonds were simulated but Troy had gotten it for her on her eighteenth birthday . . . and she loved the way it looked against the otherwise dark outfit. She nodded once at her appearance before going back downstairs to get ready to leave. Angel needed fresh food and water–and his impromptu swimming pool needed to be whipped up–and she had to grab her keys and purse. Then she could get this show on the road. She sighed, stepping over Angel as he wagged his tail; trying to intertwine himself between her legs as she hit the ignore button on her cell phone for the fourth time in as many minutes. She pointed at the whining and whimpering German Shepherd, shaking her head as he dipped his head and gave her his best 'wounded puppy' look. She rolled her eyes skyward before she crossed her arms, blatantly ignoring the ringing phone in her hand before she reached out and ruffled Angel's fur behind his ears. Earning her a happy bark and the best doggy grin he could give her as she gave him a deadpan look. Seriously that look might work with Troy but it didn't with her. Not when she'd seen him chasing his tail two seconds before. \"Bye Angel. Behave!\" The dog yipped again, settling on his haunches as she finally opened the interior door to her garage. God it had taken her longer to get around the dog to the side door than it had for her to do her hair and makeup . . . that decided it. She needed a cat. She shook her head, stopping to smile at the gleaming black 72 Gran Torino practically preening on its wheels; running her hand down the hood appreciatively as she made her way to the driver's door. She'd knew that most people thought the monster of a car was too much for her–and she'd had more than a few guys outright laugh at the fact that she drove a stick–but she'd fallen in love with it as soon as she'd seen it on-line. And Troy had been a sweetheart, surprising her with it on her twenty-first birthday. She sank into the plush seats, cranking the car and listening to the deep throaty idle before she reached under the dash and flipped the switch for the best feature. The radar deflector that Troy had painstakingly installed after her fourth speeding ticket. She grinned, reaching up and hitting the clicker for the door before she threw the car into reverse; edging out and into the street slowly. She made her way to the edge of her new neighborhood, trying to make sure she kept all of the kids running and playing in her sights before she pulled out onto the main road. She kept a moderate pace, glancing around until she cleared the first few lights. But as soon as she saw it was clear she was gone, maneuvering between the cars on the street as she made her way to Huntington Park. As she drove, Essence started mentally preparing herself for the day–well night ahead of her . . . until her cell phone rang again. She reached down, glancing at the name on the face plate before she rolled her eyes. Today was going to seem insanely long as it was. And talking with her favorite but meddling brother was only going to make it seem longer. She sighed, answering the call as she sped past a Prius, shaking her head at the hybrid as it puttered along beside her. Car of the future her ass . . . \"Yes Troy, can I help you?\" \" Why in the hell do you keep ignoring my calls?\" Essence sighed, rolling her eyes again as she shifted into the next gear; easily bypassing the other cars as she got closer and closer to her turn off. She knew she shouldn't take as much pleasure in hearing the irritation coloring her brother's voice but she couldn't help it. Besides he made it far too easy for her to harass him with how he worried. And she was his little sister, it was kind of her job to turn his hair gray. \"Because I'm on my way into work as we speak. And you know how I feel about driving and talking on cell phones.\" She heard him snort and it was all too easy for her to see him leaning back in his seat as he rolled his eyes at her. She grinned, trying to fight back the wave of homesickness that started to bubble in her chest. God he was one of the few things she actually missed about Chicago. \" Yeah you do it all the time.\" She shrugged, taking the turn onto 710 a little faster than necessary as she grinned. She couldn't argue with him there. \"What's up Troy? What's making you such a worry wart, huh?\" Tory sighed into the phone, letting her hear just how serious he was as he almost whined into the phone. She rolled her eyes. He was whining . . . he just wouldn't admit to it. \" I just miss you, Elixir. God now I know how Mom and Dad felt when I moved out after I turned eighteen. This is torture!\" She laughed, leaning further back into her seat as she tried to relax before she went into work. So she was still doing well over the speed limit and weaving in between the cars poking by her. She needed to try and get as much in as she could before she walked through those doors. And she wasn't going to do it on the phone with Troy. \"I miss you too, Troy. Now stop worrying so much! I'm fine. But look, I'm almost at work so let me get off here. I promise you can talk my ear off on the way home, alright?\" She heard him rustle around before he answered, sounding a little more at ease now that they'd spoken. \" Fine. Have fun at work.\" \"You too, big Brother. Love you.\" \" Love you too.\" They both hung up in sync, something they always did. Mainly because neither liked to hang up on the other when they didn't have to. But as she slowed to turn into her parking lot she had to admit that maybe her day wouldn't be as long now as she'd thought. Smiling softly to herself she shook her head, moving to park. She knew–that despite their differences and the fifteen year age gap–nothing could sever the bond she had with her brother . . . As soon as Essence clocked out she made good on her promise, calling her brother to talk about any and everything she could think of. She told him about how her house looked now that it was finished and all of Angel's antics both on and after their walk while he told her about the cases he was working on back in Chicago. And even though they talked well into the early morning hours, Essence didn't feel badly about it. If anything it was almost like he was there with her as they spoke, just in another room. Even now, as she tried to wrangle Angel and get him ready for their new routine half asleep she wasn't sorry to have spent so long on the phone. Besides, Troy had apparently needed to hear from her as badly as she had him. She looked around her kitchen and living room, making sure she had everything she needed. Her keys were already clipped to the iPod strap and she'd tucked her cell phone into the strap of her sports bra, reminding herself to actually find some jogging or yoga pants with pockets before she bent to ruffled Angel's fur. He yipped and jumped, already tugging on his leash as they made their way to the front door. And he almost jumped off the porch to chase the neighbor's cat as she bent and contorted to lock the door, forcing her to wrap the leash tightly around her arms as she scolded him. She sighed, letting him lead the way as she rolled through her music; trying to find something to help her keep a good pace. She sighed, letting her mind wander in time to the music and her own steps as she and Angel made their way back to the warehouses and the waterfront. It seemed as good a place as any to run and she liked being able to feel a little more at ease in the midst of the old buildings. But as she started to come upon the few garages scattered around the district she started to rethink that opinion. Angel kept trying to leap at the other–cage and fenced–dogs as they barked, forcing her to keep fighting him to move forward. She rolled her eyes, tugging him with her as she moved closer to the garage she'd seen the day before. Of all the days for him to decide he was Rambo puppy today was the one he picked. She stopped, about to point and reprimand Angel when her phone started to vibrate beneath her shirt; causing her to groan before she went to retrieve it. Right as four men drove by and started to cat call and whistle to her, making her roll her eyes at them as she fought with the cell and the dog. Seriously they thought shit like that was attractive? She shook her head, glancing at the name before she growled. She hit the answer insignia, not even giving her brother time to start as she drolled to him over the line. \"What's wrong now Troy?\" \" Please let me help you get a job, Essence. We both know that working in retail and part time at the hospital is not going to pay all of your bills!\" She rolled her eyes as she sighed, leaning back against the fenced in yard of the garage, completely ignoring everything around her as she tried to talk sense into her brother. \"We've been over this, Troy. I don't want a job you found me. I want to find one for myself! That way my co-workers will respect me. And not think I need to be kept.\" Troy sighed to himself, letting her hear how frustrated he was about all of this. She knew she shouldn't have said anything last night but oh no. She just had to talk to him about everything and now he was in worry mode. \" I just want you to be secure, Essence. I want to give you everything you need.\" \"I want you to remember I'm not a child anymore Troy!\" She bit out exasperatedly, going to run the hand tangled in Angel's leash through her hair. Only to remember she'd thrown it back into a high ponytail rather than dealing with it. \"Listen, I know it's hard to let me be an adult after you raised me . . . but I just need a big brother, Troy. One who would be there if I fail at all of this. But you've got to let me try. I don't mind the work, Troy, I never did. You just have to believe and trust me that I can live on my own.\" She sighed, letting her hand fall back to her side as Troy spoke again. And she felt bad but she knew it was something he needed to do. He couldn't coddle her forever. \"I'm sorry. I'll try harder to let go. Love you.\" She smiled, sagging against the fence as she answered him. He was a good brother. Over protective and nerve-racking but good. She turned, raising a brow to the older man that had moved to the opening in the fence she was propped against; smiling to her shyly as he gave her a little wave. \"I love you too, Troy. Look, let me call you when I get off work, okay? I think I'm messing with this guy's business looking all cop-like so I've got to go. Give my love to Ava for me. Bye.\" She glanced back at the man beside her, grinning bashfully as she waved the phone. \"Sorry. Over protective big brother.\" The man chuckled, the sound warm and welcoming as he shook his head lightly. \"That's fine darling. I just wanted to check on you. Make sure you were okay.\" She smiled back to him, relaxing as he shifted on his feet slightly. He was a little taller than her with hair that was more white and gray than the dark brown she could see on the ends, with a completely white thick mustache above his friendly grin. He was wearing worn and slightly dirty work pants and a shop shirt, the name Otto embroidered in the oval patch over his heart and a pair of what looked like really thick glasses peeking out of the pocket with a small wrench and screwdriver. \"I'm fine, just family drama. Well over protective brother drama.\" He nodded, running a hand over his hair as he grinned to her sheepishly. \"I kind of overheard. So . . . you're looking for a new job?\" She nodded hesitantly, cocking her head to the side curiously as the man before her started to resemble a shy little boy more and more. Finally he grinned, shoving his hands in his pockets and rocked on the balls of his feet before he nodded back to the large garage. It was bigger than most of the others she'd passed. And there were a good bit of junked and wrecked cars in the side fence. \"Well you're in luck, kid. I need a secretary. My wife keeps nagging me to get the office under control but I can't ever seem to find the time. Or the willpower.\" Essence grinned, crossing her arms and tugging Angel to sit beside her. \"And judging from your desperate tone your office is a huge mess right?\" The man flushed but grinned, shrugging. \"Yeah. Something like that.\" Essence smiled apologetically, tugging at the leash to make Angel stand. \"Well I would love to but I know what clerical work pays. And I honestly can't afford to take the cut that quitting my retail job would mean. Meaning I won't really be spending too much time trying to organize your office.\" The man seemed to panic slightly before he responded quickly, practically tossing out his next statement like it were a life line. \"I'll double whatever you're making right now.\" She looked at him like he was crazy and he continued, talking almost a mile a minute as he almost pleaded with her. \"Please, kid? My last two secretaries saw the mess and quit the next second. I'm beggin' ya.\" She crossed her arms, looking at him before she sighed. She'd tell him how much she made and he would probably let her go on her way. \"Well I make ten fifty an hour now. So I really don't think–\" \"Kid I'll give you twenty-two fifty an hour.\" She blinked, trying to wrap her mind around what was happening as he shifted on his feet again. He apparently took her stunned silence as a no so he continued, trying his hardest to get her to agree. \"I'll put the offer in writing and everything. You can sign the contract the day you start. So how about it?\" Essence nodded dumbly before her face split into a bright grin. She knew she was beaming at the guy but she just couldn't help it. This was like an answer to all of her worries! \"YES!\" He nodded, his shoulders sagging in relief before he clapped his hands together; rubbing them enthusiastically as he smiled wildly to her. \"Alrighty then! Let's go on in and write all of this up. Can you start today?\" She blinked before shaking her head slowly, shifting on her feet as she reached down to pet Angel again. God was he really that desperate? \"Um no . . . I work at the hospital tonight, unfortunately. But I can start tomorrow. I'll just need to drop my key off at the store first . . .\" He nodded, extending his hand to her with an award winning smile. And Essence suddenly wondered what she'd gotten herself into. But she sighed, taking the offered hand with a smile as she sealed her proverbial fate. \"Great! I'll see you tomorrow, say eleven?\" \"Sounds great. See you then Mr . . .\" He grinned, motioning to the patch on his chest with a mischievous twinkle to his eye. Which had Essence fighting between laughing and rolling her own. God this guy was a trip. But at least he seemed nice enough. \"Like the shirt says, darling. Otto Halliwell. But feel free to call me Otto . . .\" With a nod and another warm smile, Essence wrangled Angel and started back towards the front of the garage. Now she needed to go home and start the process of quitting her old job . . . She grinned, moving through the gate back to the world outside of Halliwell Restoration. God now that was a great thought. But first she was going to finish up her run. No need to get lazy just because she was employed right? Otto watched the girl go back out front, shaking his head as he smirked. Well at least now Junie would leave him alone for a while. And who knew maybe the kid would actually stick around . . . He turned going further into his domain before he spotted ten of his favorite aggravations looking at him like he'd lost his mind. He glanced down, checking himself over before he ran a hand through his hair. His glasses weren't teetering atop his skull–for once–and he'd actually worn the matching work shirt and Dickies that Junie had laid out this morning. So why were they looking at him like he'd escaped the nuthouse? It wasn't like they'd caught him talking to the dog . . . recently anyway. Finally he had enough, crossing his arms as he demanded \"What?\" One of the younger men stepped forward slightly, practically bouncing on his feet as he pointed the way his new secretary had gone. And Otto had to fight rolling his eyes at what the kid said. God they were all so damned paranoid. \"Otto man what did you just do? She could be a cop, dude!\" Otto raised a brow to Tumbler, shaking his head again as he tried not to sound irritated. \"She's not a cop, Tumbler.\" The shorter black man behind him snorted, reaching up to adjust his ever present sunglasses before he threw in his own opinion. Some of the others chuckled but Otto just gave into the desire to roll his eyes. God they all needed to take antipsychotics or something. \"Oh sure. Because none of them like to keep German Shepherd as pets!\" Otto sighed, reaching up and pinching the bridge of his nose; counting to twenty in his head before he answered. This was his payback for teaching his son how to aggravate Junie he just knew it. \"She's not a cop. She was just looking for a job that her brother didn't hand her. That's all. Nothing more and nothing less, okay?\" Memphis looked to him, brow raised before he groaned; shaking his head. \"Please tell me you didn't hire her for the secretary job.\" Otto huffed, nodding as he glared at all of them. It was still his damn garage! \"I did.\" A chorus of groans and comments erupted in the enclosed space, every member of the group giving their opinion or prediction to how all of this would end. Well, everyone but one that is. He merely stood back, watching the others argue before he rolled his eyes. He agreed with Halliwell. The girl that had just left wasn't even close to a cop; no matter what the others said or thought. But he did have to admit–if even just to himself–that watching her try and tame the disaster zone the man called an office was going to be interesting. And at the very least extremely entertaining . . . especially since the last two who tried hadn't even lasted a full minute. A/N: I know, I know, I still have Mystery Girl to do and the sequel for the King Arthur story, but this one and the other story I posted has been on my mind. Hopefully it will help with my writer's block. Thank you to Chaosia Guadimus who's been a great help with both stories and being patient with my madness and correcting in what needed correcting and thensome. Okay, please review and let me know what you guys think. The title was previously for an X-men story that just didn't work out.[Chapter 2] Healing Hands Chapter 2 Breath in. Breathe out. Breathe in. And out. That was about the only thought on Essence Morgan's mind as she stared up at the open doors of Halliwell Restoration. She had–true to her word–dropped her keys at the other hellhole of a job a mere thirty minutes before . . . and now she just had to get a grip on herself and actually go into the new one. It couldn't possibly be any worse than what she just left. She'd gone in to the store to find the racks in disarray and stock laying everywhere while two of the other people she was supposed to work with talked and flirted, letting the third try and run the counter all by herself. And even though she'd felt bad about abandoning the third she wasn't about to stay in that mess. Not when someone was willing to pay her over twice what she was making there. She shook herself, straightening her shirt and pants as she stepped away from her Torino and towards the doors. Now she just had to go inside and see what she'd gotten herself into. As she moved to the garage she took her time looking over the other cars resting near the entrance. Most were classics or vintage cars-and in very different stages of repair and restoration- but the one that kept drawing her eye was the practically preening GT500 sitting closest to the entrance. The body had apparently been damaged and repaired-attested by the Bond-o gray and the sanded patches- but she could tell that as soon as it was primed and painted the car would be gorgeous. She shook herself, pushing through the one open door as she looked around; trying to get a feel for the shop. She really hadn't had the chance to look around much the day before and now that she had a spare moment she knew she needed to familiarize herself with her new workplace. And what a workplace it was. All of the bays were tucked away from the central portion of the garage, partially hidden by either hanging plastic from the large wooden and sheet metal doors or even the support beams and concrete joists of the building. The tool boxes and work benches had obviously seen better days but she could tell they were well cared for. Even if some of them did look like they'd exploded all over the place. She turned, watching the grease and dirt covered workers bustle about in their areas before a sound behind her caught her attention. She glanced back, relaxing once she saw Otto moving towards her with a wide smile on his face . . . until she realized that the closer he got the more nervous his smile looked. But why would he be fretting already? \"Oh thank you God, you made it. Kid you have no clue how glad I am to see you. Have any troubles with the other job?\" Essence shook her head, reaching up and pushing her hair out of her face as she tried not to snort. \"If they had a problem I really don't care. I've had enough of their crap.\" Otto laughed, seeming to relax slightly as he grinned at her. Smoothing his burgundy leather apron straight over the dark blue mechanic's shirt and his jeans. He reached into the front pocket of the apron, tugging out a pair of fairly thick wire rimmed glasses as he held his hand out towards the back of the garage. \"Now that's the kind of attitude I like to hear! C'mon kiddo. You're going back this way.\" She laughed, nodding as she moved to follow him. But the deeper into the garage they went, the more conscious she became of the attention she was garnering. She knew she'd probably over dressed but she knew you only got to make a first impression once. So the fitted black pants and black blazer over the white button down shirt might seem a bit odd for the new garage secretary. But any discomfort she'd suffer would totally be worth it . . . besides she didn't want to seem too comfortable or people might get the wrong impression. Otto moved up a set of rusting and shadow shrouded steps, stopping in front of two frosted glass and wooden doors as he turned to her. He pointed to the one on the far left, almost casually informing her as he pulled a massive set of jingling keys from his pants pockets. \"That's the private office kiddo. No one expects you to do a damn thing in there so just ignore its existence. But this one,\" he motioned from the door marked Private to the one labeled Office. \"This is all you.\" He turned back to her, grinning sheepishly as he pushed the key into the lock. \"Now I just wanna remind you of what you're getting yourself into here . . .\" Essence smiled, reaching up and running her fingers through her slightly waving hair again as Otto stalled for time. She knew that whatever was behind that door couldn't possibly be that bad. But she would humor the kindly mechanic and try not to patronize him. \"I remember, Otto. I can actually appreciate this a lot more than I could my old job. Especially with how much you're going to pay me.\" Otto chuckled ruefully, turning back to unlock the door as he shook his head. But as soon as the grimy and dusty door swung open Essence knew she'd been wrong. What was behind the wood and glass was as bad as Halliwell was making it out to be. Actually it was worse. She took a tentative step inside, looking over the disarray and clutter. The filing cabinets seemed to be bursting at the seams, oceans of paper and carbon copies overflowing into the floor while teetering stacks of what looked like invoices were settled haphazardly all over the room. She turned back to Otto, blinking before she gathered herself. \"Wow . . . now I know why the other two quit on the spot huh?\" Otto ran a hand over his silvering hair bashfully, leaving a dark smudge of either grease or oil in his white tresses before he nodded. She sighed, stepping completely into the room and dropping her purse into the ripped green leather office chair. Before she grimaced at the mushroom cloud of dust and dirt that stirred from the simple movement. God how long had it been since someone had cleaned up in here? She turned, hands on her hips as she started to make a mental list of what would need to be done. Other than just setting everything on fire and starting over fresh. That was her fool-proof failsafe should the surely lurking dust bunnies plan a counter strike. She shook herself, smiling to Otto as he shifted on his feet. He still seemed like he expected her to cut out at any second. \"Alright. I guess I need to get started. But first I need to sign that contract.\" Otto sighed in relief, pushing his glasses onto his nose as he rolled his eyes skyward. His lips moving in a silent prayer before he tugged a rolled cluster of papers from his back pocket. Correction: a greasy cluster of papers from his back pocket. Oh she was going to have to do something to fix all of this . . . or at least remember to never wear white again. \"Oh thank you Jesus. Right here kiddo. And you have no idea how much this means to me.\" Essence glanced back around the room skeptically before raising a brow at him as he searched for a pen that worked. He moved to the almost completely hidden desk, shoving a towering pile of papers to the side and unfurling the contract before he signed his portion. His scrawling signature taking up a good portion of the bottom page. He handed her the pen, extending it to her like he was handing her a life grenade. She laughed, neatly inking her signature beneath his one both copies before tucking her–or the less greasy–copy into her purse to take home. Otto laughed, shaking her hand happily as he continued to thank her. The shit eating grin never leaving his face even as she practically pushed him out of the office. She sighed, closing the door behind the odd man before looking over the warzone she had to fix. God where in the world did she need to start? Taking a deep breath she had decided to stack the papers in their proper individual places…painstakingly going through each one. By mid-afternoon Essence had finished the stacks of papers upon the desks and filing cabinets–which was a surprising in itself from the amount of paperwork–and had started on one of the filing cabinets. She had opened all the windows to let out the musky and stuffiness of the room, turning on the lone fan as well as shedding her jacket. Essence even went as far as to fold back her sleeves up to her elbows. With her iPod on full blast, the young woman blocked out all the noise from the garage, working at a steady fast pace. She always did work better and harder with her own music; it was her own rhythm to help her work. Not to mention it placed her in a world of her own. By late afternoon Essence turned on the lights but kept both the blinds and windows open as there was still the stuffiness inside the small room as she went through another filing cabinet. The dust was all over the place, Essence wondering if she should wear a mask next time as she couldn't seem to stop from sneezing. Oh, what had she gotten herself into? Atley only came to talk with Memphis about the list they were to be doing, not babysit some grown ass woman that could possibly be a cop. But, oh no, Otto had cornered him before he can leave to go back to his apartment to watch the woman who continued to work nonstop in the office since everyone had left to go home. Why couldn't Otto just tell the woman it was time to go and make her go on her way? So here he was outside by the open painting docks smoking his–or what it feels like–hundredth cigarette, wishing he had another pack with him as he only had one more smoke left. Sighing, he flicked the bud away from anything that can possibly be flammable and blow the whole damn building up. Only then will Otto literally kill him, bring him back from the dead, and kill him again. This shop was his life that held so many memories, not just from the days of when it was a chop-shop but also when he went legit...then back again to the illegal world. Otto was a smart man, how was it possible that he couldn't see that this woman could possibly be a cop and be a threat not just to them but also to the business that they have gotten into after the whole incident with Memphis' kid brother. Walking back inside Atley closed and locked the large doors to the paint docks, knowing that he wasn't going to smoke when he didn't have another pack in hand. He then walked towards the front of the garage, looking through the glass windows of the office to watch the woman continue to work away without even bothering to look up. One thing he can say about the mysterious woman was that she was indeed a hard worker. She's been at that fast pace nonstop for the last thirteen hours, too engross in fixing that damn office that Otto let slip into a hurricane disaster after his Goddaughter had cleaned and put some order to it a few years back. It was a wonder just how much this woman got done without so much as a five minute break for herself. Of course, if she was a cop it's possible that she could be looking any sort of evidence that can link them to the stolen cars they've boosted since the whole Calitri incident. Then again she's only glanced at the information on the papers to put them in a certain pile that she has created, so she couldn't have found anything in that short ten seconds that it takes her, right? Atley sighed again, rubbing the back of his neck. He was such at odds with the woman that he didn't know what to do or even think about her as of yet. But he certainly was keeping a close eye on her just to be on the safe side. Looking down at his watch, Atley walked towards the office, thinking that midnight was enough time for her to work on that damn office and for them to get home and get some sleep. Essence continued to work nonstop, not really paying attention to the time as she frowned at each and every piece of paper that she picked up. So far she had five types of piles she had sorted the paperwork into. One was paper worker over three years, the second was restoration continuing, third was supplies for the garage, the fourth was paperwork for under three years, and the last one was papers that have been badly stained with grease to the point that she couldn't read anything on it. She has been lucky so far to not run into any sort of trouble with the five stacks and prayed that it would stay that way. She stood up with a small stretch, cracking her neck to relieve the tension that has been building up since she started in the office. Essence started when someone placed a hand on her shoulder, her heart racing a hundred miles per second. Taking out of her earphones as she turned, she saw a man she did not know looking apologetic, his hands raised in surrender. He was tall, six foot three inches maybe, with blondish-brown hair that was slicked back and hazel eyes that seemed to have seen too much of the world. Essence felt bad for him, she almost wanted to hug him and tell him that everything was going to be all right as she gave him the world. Of course that could just be the motherly instinct within her and she would never embarrass herself that way whatsoever. Or even let him and others know of her precious treasure just yet. \"Sorry Miss didn't mean to startle you. But it's nearing midnight and everyone has gone home.\" Essence flushed in embarrassment, looking towards the glass windows to see nothing but an empty garage. She kicked herself as she always did this. Whenever she was working on a project and had all her focus on it she never paid much attention to anything around her. \"Oh, Otto should have told me, I usually don't look at the time when I'm working this hard.\" The man smiled, seeing just how flustered she was over the situation, Essence becoming even more embarrassed that he noticed. Of course Atley knew it wasn't her fault and shouldn't really stress over it. He would have to tell Otto to suggest an alarm of sort to let the woman know when she needs to take a break or when the garage was closing. Though, it's possible that Otto would have had let her stay all night to finish the damn office. Something he would be telling his wife in revenge of making him babysit. But when he took another look around the office and saw just how much more presentable it really was now. Maybe presentable enough to actually let customers wait in here from now on. \"I think he had rather you be working hard as you have been. His wife, Junie, has been on his ass about the filing and the cleaning of this office for a while now. Their Goddaughter had it cleaned and pristine at one point and Otto just let it all go to hell.\" he told her as Essence returned to her decent self. He thought of how he liked her better all messy instead of prissy. \"The name's Atley Jackson, by the way.\" Essence shook his hand, smiling shyly. \"Essence Morgan; well, let's get you out of here.\" Atley nodded, letting the young woman walk before him, who turned back into the room and closed all the windows and the blinds, muttering to herself all the while. Atley couldn't help but smile in amusement, making sure not to let the woman see that he was laughing at her as he noticed that she gets embarrassed easily. He then turned off all the lights on his way, noting Essence standing by as he locked the doors to the garage. He wondered if that was a habit to make sure it was locked properly or something else. \"Well, I'm sorry to have made you stay so late. Have a good night,\" Essence nodded before walking towards her car. Atley smiled at the woman–not able to believe that she was driving that monster of a car and wondered if it was a cover up to get them to like her–nodding as she waved at him before backing out of her parking space. Perhaps she wasn't a cop after all, but one couldn't be too careful. If she was, however, that woman was definitely one hot cop. The next day Essence packed a bag to take with her to the garage as she was to work third shift at the hospital that night. She only had to make sure to let Otto know of her leaving early so he wouldn't freak out and wonder where she was–and not to mention to set her alarm on her phone to remind her or else she would be working nonstop till midnight again. Entering the garage Essence bee lined for the office as she wanted to get a start on the filing before looking and speaking with Otto. She had disposed of her bags and jacket when someone knocked on the open door. Turning, the young woman smiled shyly at Atley, who was leaning against the door frame. \"Hey, you ready to work until midnight again?\" Essence laughed, blushing. She didn't know what it was, but something by the way the man looked at her was almost as though he wanted to see into her soul and bring her true self out on the open. She had a feeling that he might think she could be hiding something from him, but this was the first time she's ever seen the man in her life, so it couldn't possibly be that, right? Her asshole of an ex wouldn't send someone all the way here just to spy on her, right? Maybe it was her imagination; overreacting on things since the incident five years ago. \"No, I actually have to work third shift at the hospital. Which I have to tell Otto, so do you know where he is?\" she asked, thinking it would be best to find her boss before getting lost in her work. \"Yeah, follow me.\" Atley started walking further back of the garage. \"So you work at the hospital too?\" Essence nodded, looking at all the classic cars that were being restored or fixed within the garage. She didn't really pay much attention her first day yesterday but as she followed Atley the woman wanted nothing more than to go up to one of these cars and touch them or sit inside for just a minute. \"Yeah, I'm a nurse slash paper worker; it was the only job I found that helps me more on my choice of career.\" Atley raised a curious eyebrow at her, \"Which is?\" \"I want to be a psychologist.\" Essence shrugged, looking up at the taller man, even with her three inch heels he towered over her. Sometimes she hated being short. \"The schools are cutting back, so a second psychologist wasn't going to work. So I use my degree and knowledge to help the crazies that we sometimes get in the ER, and when we're packed to the max, to calm them so we can get the area in order.\" Atley looks at her with a piercing gaze, going over what she has said. \"I can't imagine you being a psychologist.\" Essence laughed, gaining the group of people in the painting dock attention. \"Yeah, that's what I get a lot. I'm either a school teacher or–before I quit–in retail.\" \"Essence is Atley bothering you?\" Otto teased, the man frowning and holding out his arms in a 'Why do you assume I'm bothering her?' \"No, Otto, he helped me find you. I just wanted to let you know that I have to leave at six tonight because I'm working at the hospital. I can bring you next month's schedule to let you know when I'm leaving early or staying here longer.\" Otto nods, knowing that this was actually working on their favor. They had another list to get ready to do and he and Memphis were just talking about how to work in the garage around the woman so she wouldn't see them since all their work plans was there. Maybe it was time to move it to another location? \"Okay, that's no problem at all.\" he agreed with a smile. Essence smiled in return, feeling grateful. She knew that Otto would be a great boss and be understanding, but she thought she might have some problems with certain issues with him when she tried to work in his office. \"Great, well I'll go back to the office and work as much as I possibly can today.\" Otto waved a hand at her, smiling back at her. \"Don't you worry your pretty little head, kid. Take all the time you need in that office and don't over work yourself now.\" Essence nodded in return and waved at the group as she turned to go back to the office. She knew her own streak and taking her time was certainly out of the question. As the group watched her go, Mirror Man was the one to disrupt the silence. His words making the others roll their eyes as it made one man's blood boil with anger. \"Damn she has a fine ass! Almost as big as J-Lo!\" Atley glared at the short man, disgusted with his disrespect of the woman. Then the words that came out of his mouth not only surprised him, but also the others. Atley didn't know what possessed him to say the words but he did and he hoped no one saw the meaning behind them like he knew in his heart what they had meant but didn't want to acknowledge it. He just met the girl! \"Boy, you best respect that woman, or so help me I'll personally throw you into the ocean with an anchor to hold you down, got it.\" Everyone watched in amazement as Atley walked away, angry. However, it was Memphis who was frowning in curiosity, looking after his best friend. Of all the years he's known the other man he has never seen him act that angry over something so small. Especially since he knows how Mirror Man was with most women. Yes, he would have given a cold look and even freezing cold words to the one who did the offensive, but he would never look so...angry. \"I think Atley has a crush on the new secretary.\" Memphis muttered in confusion, wondering if that's what he truly saw or it was just his imagination. \"What?\" Essence rolled her neck as she was finally able to finish two filing cabinets in time for her to change and go to the hospital. She hated the feeling of incomplete, because she knew that the office needed a lot of work but the hospital helps her a bit more with paying the bills. Not to mention she loved it and it helps her honed in what she really does love–and that was helping people by talking to them and listening when they feel that no one else would. Grabbing her bag, the young woman walked to her right and into the small bathroom she had seen earlier when Atley took her to find Otto. She doubled checked that the door was lock, grimacing at the how disgusting the small bathroom was or smelled but didn't complain much. This was a garage full of men. Shaking her head Essence quickly changed into her light blue scrubs as she exchanged her high heels with comfortable tennis shoes. Taking a deep breath, and shuddering it out through a shaky breath the young woman walked out and towards the office, clutching the handles to her bag nervously. Many of the men were staring at her strangely, Essence gathering her things quickly as she hated how they were staring. Almost like they were changing her scrubs to the nurse outfit from the fifties or something. Her thoughts were confirmed when they started to yell out to her and whistling as soon as she stepped out of the office. \"Hey baby, wanna play doctor with me?\" \"You should have worn the skirt outfit instead honey!\" \"Yeah, you might get more of a turn on from the men!\" Essence cringed, kicking herself. Why did she have to change into her scrub clothes here? Oh, yeah, because she wanted to stay later to clean the office up than having to run to the hospital and change clothes there. Then a voice startled her–and the men–looking up to her right. She would have thought that he would still be with Otto and the others, talking to them. So why was he here at the front of the garage? \"Knock it off assholes! Get back to work; Otto's already pissed off at you guys for being behind!\" Atley yelled. He stood in front of the blushing woman to keep her from the other men's view, glaring at the men with a hard cold stare he can muster. He felt the same sort of anger when Mirror Man had disrespected the woman when she was out of earshot, and it only confused him even more than when he yelled at the younger man. What was going on with him and this woman? It was like she was bringing something out in him that he never knew existed. \"Come on, we were only just playing around!\" They started shouting apologizes as the men knew that to be on the other man's bad side was a bad idea. Atley ignored them–grinning almost sinister–instead letting them think they were in trouble and to leave the woman alone the next time she comes in to work. He waited for her as she quickly gathered her other bag and sweater, only to usher her towards the entrance. Essence leaned into the man when his hand was pressed to the small of her back, the woman feeling comfortable with the contact from the man she only met yesterday. Once outside Atley smiled at the exhale Essence gave, smiling up at him with her cheeks still flushed. He smiled back in return, liking the innocent flush she was displaying. \"Thank you, I guess I should have changed at the hospital instead of here.\" Atley shrugged, never losing his smile. \"No problem kid. And if they continue to hassle you, let me or Otto know and we'll take care of it.\" Essence forced a smile at the man calling her kid, but nodded with appreciation. She didn't know why but hearing him call her kid made her feel small and not in the same league. What league was that? She wasn't sure but wanted to find out. This man made her feel things she hasn't felt in a long time and it confused her, as well as it clouded her sense a bit when she was near him. Maybe it was best to just stay away from him? But how could she if he was long time friends with Otto, surely he would be coming around the garage all the time. \"Thank you, I guess I'll see you later?\" Atley frowned, tilting his head to the side as he watched Essence walk towards her car. He had noted the forced smile and wondered what he had said that she took offensive. He smiled as Essence gave him a small wave before turning the car around and driving away. Atley shook his head. He needed to clear his thoughts before the boost later that night–which is a good thing that the new secretary wasn't going to stay to midnight today–he didn't need any distraction at that moment, especially something so small...of course, he wasn't sure if what he was feeling was small. As he went back inside with another quick shake of his head, Atley glared at the men still working on the cars whom quickly duck their heads with shame, working harder and faster. He headed into the back of the garage with the thoughts of the boost when he was taken aback by the suggestive smiles and confusion on his team and family members faces. He frowned at them, holding out his arms in confusion at their looks towards him, wondering if he had done something wrong. Or if they were blaming him for something that the younger kids have done... again . \"What?\" Out of all the things to come out of Mirror Man's mouth, the words that spilled out weren't the ones he was expecting. What in hell's name did he get that stupid idea in his head? He hadn't said a word about the woman or even glanced at her in a way that would suggest he wanted anything from her...right? Despite it, Atley could feel himself blushing, narrowing his eyes and glaring at the shorter man. \"In all of the year we've known you man, we never seen you had a crush on somebody!\" Mirror Man yelled out first, \"Especially a woman!\" \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Donnie smacked the shorter man's head, who started to protest against him and everyone else that was glaring at him. \"What? Man, I will kick your ass!\" \"Nothing, now let's get started in how we're going to steal these cars tonight.\" Memphis says, changing the topic quickly. He knew that it wasn't the time to have any distractions and made a point of letting the other's know with a glance. However, one thing for sure was Atley having a crush on a woman was sure damn funny to the group, and they couldn't wait to see what happens between the two adults. A/N: Thanks to Chaosia Guadimus for being the first (and so far only) reviewer! Come on you guys, I know you want to review! It'll only take a few seconds to press the button and write something. :)[Chapter 3] Healing Hands Chapter 3 In the two weeks Essence and the boosts had came to a small routine. Otto had placed a large calendar in the painting area that told them when the young woman had to work third shift at the hospital or when she was staying late at the garage. It was the only way they were able to boost around her and not raise any suspicion. However, once the office was cleaned and in order Essence didn't stay late anymore, the boosts were able to breathe a little easier after that. Otto still kept the calendar up to let him know when his secretary was leaving early for the hospital so that his Goddaughter can take over. Not to mention that per Essence advice Otto had given his Goddaughter and wife money to buy all new furniture for the office. They even re-arranged the entire office around so that it looked more welcoming for both females and males, as well as re-painting the walls. Otto's and Junie's Goddaughter had always had a good eye for what went well with the shop and a good sense of fashion, no matter what situation it was if it was for a girly shop or a garage. Atley was also hardly seen around the young woman anymore after the group teased him, but he would occasionally smile or nod at her as he passed by to go see Otto–when she looked up, of course. Due to being such a hard worker Essence hardly ever look up from reading over the papers or away from the computer screen. Sometimes Atley would look through the door window, watching her slender fingers move across the keyboard rapidly and without pause. When he strayed too long Atley would shake his head and move away as fast as he could, looking around to make sure none of the workers were watching him. Essence was a bit confused by the other man, but didn't mention it nor did she let it bother her for no more than a minute or so. It was just her imagination, right? Besides, it was hard enough to try to keep the work in order as the mechanics brought in loads of paper work for her to look over and file. Most of them she couldn't even read due to grease stains and so she would let Otto look them over when he can, as he has done his share of staining the paperwork and was all too familiar. Not to mention he helped sort out the ones she found in the disaster of the office too. After the scrub incident Essence took to changing at the hospital instead, leaving the garage a half hour earlier. She did notice that the mechanic men had not once been rude to her after Atley yelled at them, which the young woman was all too grateful. They had become a little friendly with her, which she did not mind so long as they didn't cross the line. Otto had even let Essence work on her baby on her lunch break, using the garage tools when it needed a tune up. A lot of the younger men around her age that worked there had given her weird looks because she knew her way around the garage but mostly because she drove the sleek Torino. They–as all the others who have seen her with her baby–thought the monster of a car was too much for her to handle. It was Kip Raines, Randall's little brother, who had approached her and started talking to her as he helped her with tweaking the engine– with her permission, of course. They had gotten along fairly well to a point where Kip had become fairly protective over her whenever he saw one of the mechanic's watching her or whenever Tumbler seemed to be touchy-feely. Essence noticed that she leaned more towards Toby because he was so quiet and shy that he slightly reminds her of herself. Scratch the slightly, Toby reminded her a lot of herself. He–along with the others–were impressed by the illegal radar deflector and wanted to know the story behind it. They all had laughed, not able to believe that the short woman was so content into speeding; and that her beloved lawyer brother bought the damn thing so her license wouldn't be suspended and she didn't need to pay another speeding ticket. Essence promised them that she would show them just how fast she drove and what her baby can handle when she had the time. But knowing with her schedule at both jobs, it was going to be months before she had time for herself let alone spend time with them. Then the incident that would haunt her for a while happened when it was after closing and almost everyone had gone home. She was working a bit late that night due to Kip, Tumbler, Toby, and Mirror Man distracting her that she didn't finish typing up the reports on to the computer or even file the paperwork itself. Because of her late nights Otto had given her a key–against the booster's protest–a few weeks back. But they all noticed that nothing was out of the ordinary in the weeks that passed with her having the key. And with the younger kids becoming great friends with her, the group of boosts knew that Essence wasn't a cop like they first thought and visibly relaxed around her. Now the woman had thought that she was alone in the garage, the silence whispering echoes of the day's event as the building groaned, settling in for the night. Well, at least Essence thought she was alone. Just as she finished typing of the last of the paperwork, and deciding to file it in the morning, a voice had spoken up from the open door way, Essence looking up startled and fear. She had recognized him as one of the mechanics leering at her with her nurse outfit two weeks ago and sometimes following her around the garage when none of the younger kids were around her. \"Hey baby,\" he smirked at her, looking her up and down. \"Feel like playing doctor now?\" Essence slowly stood, frowning at the man. \"Excuse me?\" she shook her head, \"I'm sorry, but you can't be here after hours.\" The man stepped inside, pushing the door behind him close, which did not close all the way. \"Oh, I've seen the looks of disgust, but underneath were looks of lust! You had to keep appearance for the others; I understand.\" Essence looked at the man with disgust, wondering what was wrong with him. How was it possible that a man thought a simple look of disinterest and disgust was portrayed as lust? How self conceited or the level of mentally crazy do you have to be? \"I have no lust for you!\" Essence ground out. She needed to get to her purse on the other side of the room to grab the pepper spray she always carried per her brother's request when she was moving out here. \"If you leave now, I won't tell Otto that you were here after work hours.\" The man leered at her, \"Playing hard to get, I love it.\" Panicking with fear Essence made a run to her purse–praying that she would be able to make it–only to be grabbed by her waist and thrown against her desk by the surprising fast man. She kicked him hard in the stomach before punching him, however he didn't went down. He growled and punched the woman back against the desk before slamming her on top of it. Essence screamed for him to let her go as she tried as hard as she can to fight him off, tears falling down the side of her face. Essence felt disgusted as the man roamed her body with his greedy hands, ripping her shirt and trying to lift up her skirt. Of all days she had to wear a skirt today. \"Let me go!\" she screamed. She started to sob at the thought of being raped again. Then the ceiling of the garage disappeared, followed by the desk she laid upon. The smelling, slightly pudgy man above her even disappeared. The garage became a small apartment with walls a pale yellow with very low orange lights. A dark shadow loomed above her, its eyes and teeth shinning, the only thing visible in the darkness. The smell of cigarettes and alcohol filled her nose. Then the shadow tried to kiss her neck, laughing as its voice seemed to be disoriented. \"That's right, scream. You know you like it!\" Suddenly the shadow was off of her and everything fell into pieces and reality returned back to the present. It took a second to realize what was happening and Essence rolled off the desk (making an even more of a mess with the items) and went to run only to hit a hard body. She looked up in fear that it was another intruder or even the man from her past, but she relaxed as she saw it was Atley she had ran into. He had a dangerous angry glint in his eyes, which softened when his hazel eyes turned to look down at the young woman. Essence turned around to see the tall silent man who hung out with Otto and the others known as Sphinx holding the mechanic down with his foot, his back to her. But she saw that in his right hand he held a blade. Essence faintly heard Atley talking to her, his hands gripping her shoulders trying to get her attention. But all she was able to think about was how close it was for the past to repeat itself. How much misfortune can she have in her life? Was she to suffer her happiness after the beautiful treasure she had conceived and had felt complete after the darkness she had went through? After that thought her world was blank as she went through the motions in a zombie daze. Atley and Sphinx walked through the doors of the garage, Atley shaking his head when he saw the black Torino still parked in front of the garage. He knew that the only reason Essence was still there was because of the younger kids had distracted her. Atley glowered, when he meets up with the group he was going to tell those kids not to distract the woman so much that she would have to stay later than her usual time. He looked over to Sphinx, who looked down at him with a raised eyebrow before giving him a curt nod. While Sphinx grabbed the list of cars they were to boost in four days Atley would go into the office and speak to the woman to try and coax her to go home. That's when they heard a crash coming from the office, followed by Essence voice. They wondered who would be stupid enough to go into a garage and try to rob them after hours. That was then they realized that the noise had come from upstairs where the office was, where Essence was supposed to be. And if memory served right, Atley knew that she was wearing a nice looking skirt that was just above the knees and a low cut, white button down shirt that day. \"Let me go!\" They heard her scream, her voice slightly muffled but there was no mistaken it was Essence. Both Atley and Sphinx ran up the stairs, Sphinx running ahead of him. Both Sphinx and Atley's eyes narrowed in anger at the sight before them, Sphinx taking hold of the mechanic and throwing him to the floor. He took out his blade incase the guy wanted to fight him, pressing his foot on his neck to keep him down–though he desperately wanted to gut the man. Atley went to take hold of Essence when she rolled off the desk and ran into him. He took hold of her arms to steady her, his eyes glowing with anger as he saw the ripped shirt showing off her black and pink lace bra that was pushing up her breasts. Looking up from the exposed flesh, Atley mentally shook his head and remembered the situation. \"You okay?\" Atley asked softly. He tried not to let the anger–or the lust–show in his eyes or face, not wanting to scare her even further than she might be already. He called out her name softly, shaking her for good measure as she had turned to stare over to Sphinx and the mechanic and had not said a single word which was worrying him. He called her name once more, noting that she seemed to be in some sort of daze. Essence then shook her head, beginning to sob as she turned back to him and buried her face into his chest. Atley hugged her tightly, not wanting to even think about what would have happened if neither he nor Sphinx had needed to be at the garage at that late hour. Taking a deep breath, he quickly took off his jacket and draped it over the shaking woman to cover her up before hugging her against him once more. He nodded to his silent partner who roughly took hold of the scared mechanic and walked out the door. He saw him grin menacingly and knew he was going to inflect some pain on the would-be rapist to make him think twice before doing this to another woman again. The whole time the mechanic was screaming of how Essence wanted it, but of course neither of the men believed him as they saw enough. Atley didn't know what to do. He was beyond pissed off of what happened and what could have happened , they were just lucky that they got there on time. One thing he was certain though Otto was going to fire that damn mechanic and he was going to stay with Essence whenever she stayed after hours at the garage from that day forward to make sure that this would never happen again. \"Come on honey; let's get you home, hm? I can have Sphinx follow me to your house that way you don't have to drive.\" Atley suggested, feeling the woman continue to shake and cry. Essence nodded, not letting the older man go or even saying a word. Atley looked at the situation and knew for a fact that it was going to take twice as long to get the woman to start walking. So, with a sigh Atley picked the woman up and walked over to the coat hanger to grab her purse. He knew that Otto was going to send his Goddaughter to work for him for a bit so that Essence would be able to take a few days after this ordeal. Walking out he saw Sphinx walking back inside the building with a hatred and killing look in his eyes. \"Get the list than meet us outside, you're gonna follow me to her house.\" Sphinx nods his head curtly before walking towards the painting area briskly. Atley walked slowly, feeling his right leg begin to tense up and cramp, cursing the stairs as he made sure not to drop the woman. He could feel her shake violently; making him even angrier as to what almost went down that night–though he was impressed to see the bruise already forming on the mechanic's jaw. At her Torino, Atley set her down and goes through her purse to take out the keys and unlocking her doors. He ushered her in before moving around to the driver side, just as Sphinx walked out and locked the doors to the garage. After readjusting the seat and the mirrors, Atley turned on the car and looked to the woman who was curled up in the passenger seat with her arms wrapping his jacket around her, the left side of her face starting to form a bruise that he didn't see beforehand. Oh, that mechanic was going to pay for hitting the woman, he just wished that he was the one to be able to inflect some pain on the mechanic instead of Sphinx. \"Alright sweetheart, where do you live?\" Essence gave him her address, staring out of the window in a daze. Atley stared at her worriedly before putting the car in reverse, looking over to Sphinx, who also looked concerned, desperately worried for the young woman. They both have seen and heard tales–more far worse–than what could have happened tonight. By the time Atley had parked the car in the woman's driveway, he saw how much she had calmed down, but was still too much in a daze to comprehend anything around her. The more he watched her the more he felt that something was off. The older man was almost scared to leave her by herself and wondered if he should skip the meeting tonight and stay to make sure Essence wouldn't do anything rash. Quickly getting out, he moved around to the passenger side, opening the door just as Sphinx parked his car next to the Torino. Atley picked the woman up in his arms and nodded to Sphinx, who took the keys from him and quickly walked to the front door. Because of the extra weight Atley's right leg began to cramp up once again, making him start to limp painfully. Essence felt numbed. She remembered Atley asking directions for her house, but she didn't remember giving it to him. Then she was being ushered up to her front door, yet she didn't remember the drive to her home. Finally Essence snapped out of it when they entered the threshold and heard Angel barking only to start whining. She saw Sphinx glaring down at the German Sheppard, who had lowered his head at him, much to Essence's amusement. \"Put me down, please,\" she whispered softly, tensing up from Atley's closeness. Atley did as she asked, holding the young woman by her waist, not wanting to let her go just yet. Despite what happened that night, Essence felt her skin heating from the older man's touch and closeness as her sense started to fog from the smell that only belonged to Atley. He was looking over her face carefully, and intently, trying to see what was going through her mind. However, the young woman wasn't looking at him rather she was looking down at her hands resting on his arms, almost as though she were not truly there once again when in reality she was trying to get her bearings straight from being so close to the man. \"Um, thank you both,\" she started in a whisper. She looked up at them feeling both foolish and embarrassed. Essence could just feel herself begin to fall apart again, but steeled herself as she knew that she had broken down in front of these two men too many times already in the past hour. She could only hope that they didn't see her as a helpless woman who needed saving every time there was something she couldn't do. \"For saving me and driving me home; I can take care of myself from here on out. Have a good night.\" Atley smiled softly, brushing her hair back from her face. \"It wasn't a problem at all, sweetheart. Come on let me help you to your room so you can shower and change for bed, hm?\" Essence forced her smile, shaking her head. \"No, I'll be fine, I promise. Please, go home.\" With that said she moved towards her stairs, wanting to wash away the greasy feel of the mechanic's hands and mouth. She didn't see the looks the men gave each other or the quiet conversation as she reached her bedroom, wanting that scolding hot shower and scrub her skin raw red. She heard the front door closing and was all too grateful that they have done what she had asked. Turning on the water at full blast hot and Essence quickly stripped down and entered the large shower. She dropped her head down to let the water wash all over her, loving how her skin was stinging from how hot the water was. With her eyes still close she tilted her head back and favored how quickly she was soaked. Moving away from the spray of water momentarily Essence takes hold of the squared loofah bath sponges, squirt some flower smelling body wash and begun to scrub furiously at her skin. Once she scrubbed her enter body, Essence washed it all away and scrubbed her skin raw once again. She repeated this a couple of more times until she merely stood underneath the spray of water. It was only then did she break down completely, letting the tears go as she fell down to her knees only to move to her behind. She wrapped her arms around her knees and held tight, wishing for someone familiar to be there to hold her and tell her that it was all a dream and none of it was real. Both now and what happened five years ago. Watching the woman walking up the stairs, both men frowned with concerned curiosity. Looking to his friend, Sphinx placed a hand on his friend's shoulder and gave him a level look. Something seemed to be off with this woman, almost as though she had almost expected the outcome of what happened tonight...or what could have happened. \"Stay with the girl, I'll let the others know.\" he told him softly. Atley nodded in agreement, not trusting himself to leave the woman after what's happened–especially with how she was coming to the present and into a daze every so often. Nodding to himself Sphinx looked towards the stairs with concern once more before leaving the house. Atley closed and locked the door behind the large British man and went to go upstairs when he heard a whine. Looking down he saw the German Sheppard sitting down, facing him. When he knew he had his attention, the dog whined again and held up its left leg as though he wanted him to shake it–which the dog did not mean by lifting its leg. Although he desperately wanted to check up on her, Atley could see just how desperate the dog looked at him to go outside and do its business. With a sigh and a nod, Atley moved towards the back doors, needing a cigarette to try and calm himself further as he still felt angry of the whole situation. He noted just how relatively clean the house looked that made him thought about his apartment and flinched. Opening the door the poor dog literally ran outside to do his business. Quickly Atley took out one of his cigarettes and lit one, taking a deep, long drag. He can feel his nerves on high alert, but most of all he was concerned for the woman upstairs, possibly taking a shower to wash away the filth that asshole had left on her skin. Thinking about that he took another deep drag of his cigarette, looking up at the dark skies. It was clear out, despite that on the news it was supposed to rain in the middle of the night. He took a little longer with his cigarette so that the woman wouldn't fear him because of his anger. He desperately wanted another one but knew that he needed to go upstairs and check up on the woman. He went to flick it to the side but instead dropped it to the floor and stepped on it. He whistled for the dog who immediately ran past him and back inside the house. Atley locked the sliding door and quietly listened to the quiet house, hearing the water running still from upstairs. Frowning Atley felt something wasn't right in his gut and hurriedly rushed back upstairs. At the top of the stairs he looked at the four closed doors until he saw the door on the right slightly opened. He entered tentatively and was grateful that it was the master bedroom. Atley quickly looked around the darken room, noticing just how clean it was–just like the rest of the house, though he did noted the bed wasn't done. He wondered if Essence was a bit of a neat freak or it was just a habit…he would assume it was a habit since the bed wasn't made. Shaking his head he saw the light coming from what he assumed to be the master bathroom, the door slightly ajar. Taking a deep breath, Atley moved forward and knocked softly, telling himself that he was only checking up on her to make sure she was all right. However what he heard broke his heart. The sobs she was trying to cover were loud within his ears. Quickly he moved forward and opened the door to quickly shut off the now ice cold water. Atley had a bit of a hard time when Essence started to scream and cry and struggle against his arms. \"Shh, sweetheart, it's me, it's Atley. Come on, sweetheart.\" he whispered softly as he dragged her out of the shower. He quickly took hold of a large towel and wrapped it around her naked body, feeling Essence start to calm down enough that her tears ceased. She held on to Atley as tightly as she did back at the garage, not wanting to let go or for Atley to leave her. Feeling his right leg begin to tensed up once again–it seems to be doing that a lot more with the woman being near him–he sat down on the cold tile floors. Essence placed her head right beneath Atley's chin, curling her body towards him for both warmth and assurance that he wasn't going to leave her alone. \"Shh it's okay sweetheart, you're safe. Come on, baby, you're safe now.\" Atley tried to sooth her shaking form. Essence shook her head, nuzzling the crock of his neck. \"Thank you; you hardly know me and you're here at my house, helping me.\" she suddenly whispered, closing her eyes tiredly. Atley smiled, rubbing the young woman's arms. \"Ah, not a problem, sweetheart; I would have done so if the first time I met you was out on the streets.\" Essence nodded slowly before she finally fell asleep. Atley looked down at the woman and sighed before wondering how he was going to move the woman from the bathroom to her bed, as well as try to get up off the floor with his sore leg. With a grunt the older man pushed his body hard against the wall and slid up, all the while holding on to the sleeping woman. A few times he had to stop and stay still when his right leg wanted to give out painfully. Once he was on his feet Atley walked into the bedroom and placed the woman on her bed, prying her fingers off of his shirt. Sitting at the edge of the bed, the older boost stared at the woman's troubled face, pushing her still wet hair away from her face. The dog jumped on to the bed and lay near his mistress, placing his head on her stomach, giving a small whine. Almost as though he knew that his mistress was in trouble that night. Atley smiled softly, scratching the dog's head before standing up. Despite that Sphinx was going to let Memphis and the others know why he wasn't there at the meeting he rather call himself just to double check that Otto fires the asshole. \"Please don't leave,\" a small voice whispered. Atley looked back to see Essence opening her eyes to slits, looking up at him. She almost looked like a frighten child– she is a frightened child, frightened of what would have came to happened just a few hours ago. He told himself, mentally shaking his head. He was old enough to be her father...okay maybe not that old , but still, he was an old man. Why in the world did she want to be with him anyways? And since when did he think about Essence wanting him ? \"I don't want to be alone,\" she continued to whisper sleepily, holding out her right hand as her left was on top of the dog's head. \"Please,\" Atley sighed, shoving a hand through his hair before nodding, \"Alright sweetheart, but just until you go back to sleep. I don't want your boyfriend coming over and seeing us in bed and try to beat the crap out of me.\" Essence chuckled softly, closing her eyes as Atley sat down next to her and leaned back against the metal headboard, only to quickly place a pillow for comfort. He was surprised that there was still room on her full size bed as Angel had his long body laid out with Essence in the middle and Atley on the side. \"I don't have a boyfriend, Mr. Jackson. No time,\" Atley frowned down at the woman as though she was crazy. \"But all you young people should have a relationship! Or are you more of the modern type and just rather have friends with benefits?\" Essence sighed and scooted closer to the older man, wrapping her left arm around his waist as she placed her head on his chest. \"I'm rather old fashion, so, no, I'm not the type to sleep around. However, with how my life is complicated, especially with the third shift at the hospital, I don't have time to go out and meet somebody.\" \"You're a one of a kind sweetheart, do you know that?\" Atley muttered, brushing his fingers through her hair, untangling the knots. He watches the dog get up and moves further down the bed before laying his head on Essence's curved legs with a content sigh. Essence hummed, snuggling closer for warmth. \"So I've been told,\" she muttered before falling back asleep as she was comfortable. Atley, glad that the woman wasn't the type to make her bed, kicked off his shoes and leaned over to pull the sheets over them. He made sure that Essence was tucked in tight so that she wouldn't catch a cold or a chill. He went back to brushing her hair, leaning back his head and closing his eyes. Next thing he knew, Atley was sound asleep, his mouth slightly open for the occasional snore. A/N: I hope you guys liked the chapter! Please review. :)[Chapter 4] Healing Hands Chapter 4 Essence groaned at the sound of her house phone, burying her face into her pillow–that seemed to move up and down on its own. Not caring who it was on the other line, the young woman snuggled deeper into her sheets and her pillow. She's never felt so rested before and didn't dare to get up because someone was trying to reach her. Essence then snapped her eyes open when she felt her leg wrapped around itself around someone else's leg. She looked down to see she was laying on top of two legs clad in dark jeans, followed by a black button down shirt tucked into the pants. She was going to slowly move away when a snore startled her. She whipped her head up to see Atley leaning back against her metal headboard with a pillow on his back. His mouth was slightly open, giving a snore once more. The young woman pursed her lips together to keep from laughing, not wanting to wake the man that–despite looking uncomfortable in that position–looked so peaceful. Lying back down to try and sleep some more–as well as wonder the emotions she was feeling from just being close to this strange man–Essence knew that she had another couple of hours before the garage opened. However the phone started ringing again letting Essence know it was time for her to get up and deal with the day. She's gone through this already–not as far as the first time, but still, far enough. What happened last night brought on too many bad memories from her past but she was able to get through it then, she can do so this time. Essence was grateful that Atley and Sphinx had returned to the garage for whatever reason and had saved her–she certainly was indebted to them whether they liked it or not. Now she just needed to be strong and remember who else was in her life to be strong for. Sitting up slightly she held the sheets to her nude form, wondering how the towel had fallen to the floor. Turning her body away from the still sleeping Atley–it seemed he didn't mind the noisy telephone–Essence reached over to grab the towel and quickly wrapped it tightly around her before throwing the warm sheets back. She quickly reached over and picked up the cordless phone from its charger as it started ringing once again. She walked towards the bathroom to let the older man sleep some more while she spoke to the person calling. \"Hello?\" She almost had to roll her eyes at the person on the other line. She liked the guy, he really was a sweetheart, and took great cares to make her comfortable–not just at the garage, but also with the people. Yet he seemed almost heartbroken and just plain guilty to what happened the night before when it wasn't even his damn fault! It wasn't like he told the guy to attack her! \" Essence, its Otto, how are you doing?\" Essence sighed, dropping the damp towel into the hamper and put on her robe she always kept on the hook behind the door. She looked longingly to her white claw foot bathtub in front of the French double doors. Apparently the previous owner's wife had a similar bathroom style at their house on the hills of Hollywood...and the Hamptons...and some island that Essence never even heard of before but sounded expensive. Whatever reason they had to buying a suburban house was beyond her–let alone selling it for cheap–but she was grateful that she had snatched it up when she was able to a few months back. \"I'm doing as well as I can be, Otto, really .\" The older man sighed with relief, the young woman picturing him pacing back and forth in the office. She might not have known the man very long, but the grandfather figure he portrayed was very familiar and predictable that sometimes it was funny…and comforting. It made missing her brother just a bit less painful. \" I'm truly sorry kiddo, Sphinx told me what had happened last night and I wanted you to know that that asshole was fired.\" he sighed, some rustling sounds in the background could be heard. \"I wanted to call last night but I figured that you needed the rest and the shock to pass over from what Sphinx had told me.\" Essence smiled, walking out of her bathroom, tapping her thigh quietly for Angel before leaving the bedroom to let Atley sleep in peace. Though she couldn't help but glower at the thought of the silent giant telling Otto how she was acting. It only made him worry even more than he should be and made her turn out like a total girl in distress. Okay, she was a girl in distress, but she hated to show her weakness to anyone . \"I'm just sorry that you're one less mechanic at your garage, Otto.\" Otto snorted at that, the rustling noise finally stopping. Essence knew that he, and everyone else, thought that she was too nice, if sometimes a bit naive. But she couldn't help it, it was who she was. She would only be annoyed or angry with a person when they pushed her buttons one too far...or when her precious treasure was being threaten or in danger. \" Nonsense, my employee's well being is far more important than any good mechanic.\" he told her as though it was nothing, but she still heard the trace of anger behind his words. Essence let Angel out to the backyard before going into her kitchen to make some coffee. She desperately needed some caffeine to wake up just a bit, and make some for Atley whom she knew drank the stuff whenever possible. \"Nevertheless I'm sorry that your other workers now have to work twice as hard and fast as you're a man down, Otto.\" she bit her lower lip, looking out the window over the sink to watch Angel sniffing around, marking his territory, and doing it again. \"If you like I can try to find someone to replace him?\" Otto chuckled softly, Essence knowing he was smiling just from the tone of voice. \"Always thinking about others rather than yourself, kiddo. No, you don't need to find anyone to replace, I can do that on my own. Now, can you do me the favor and let me speak with Atley?\" Essence bit her lower lip once more, looking back at the staircase, wondering if she should go up and wake him. Or let the poor man who had taken care of her sleep until whatever time he woke? Then again, he did just sleep through the house phone, letting her know that Atley can sleep through all kinds of noise. She decided to test her theory with Otto, seeing as he knew the man more than she did. \"He's actually asleep right now. I didn't have the heart to wake him–though I doubt I could as he was able to sleep through the phone ringing.\" Otto laughed loud and hard, Essence smiling in return as she went back to bring down some cups for the coffee. Her smile widen at Otto's next words, glad that her instincts weren't as off as she had first thought. Although she really didn't know Atley all that well, what Otto said was all too true as she witnessed it firsthand not too long ago. Despite that she tried to keep quiet. \" I swear that boy can sleep through anything, even an earthquake!–and he probably has!\" Essence chuckled at that, \"I don't doubt it, Otto.\" As she turned to bring Angel back inside Essence saw her reflection in the sun-mirror design dangling on the bare wall in the kitchen. She grimaced at the sight of the black eye, along with the bruise on her cheek, and the hand print upon her neck. Two memories combining came back to her, making her almost panic with fear because it was so real. Willing the tears to go away, Essence turned from the mirror and quickly walked over to the glass door, whistling for Angel to return. She had to clear her throat a couple of times, knowing that if any sort of emotion came out in her voice Otto will immediately know that she wasn't fine. And she needed the distraction or else she would be reliving the incidents over and over. \" All right girly, you go on and relax today–and call the hospital, there's no way in hell you're working third shift tonight.\" he told her as what sounded like tapping on paper over the other noise in the background. She sighed in annoyance. Essence knew that she needed the day off as she doubted any amount of make-up would cover up the bruises and marks left behind. Not to mention she needed to get her head together if memories from both incidents were haunting her. But she wanted distractions and her house was all done–she was unpacked and moved in. There was no way she was going to go out in the world with these bruises. Yet the young woman knew that Otto was only looking out for her, and she was grateful. She knew that there was going to be no argument she would provide to pursue him to let her go into work anyways, so why even try? \"Thanks Otto, I'll send Atley over to you as soon as he wakes up. Bye.\" At his goodbye, Essence hung up and placed the phone on the small counter before going back to making her coffee. She wished she had something stronger rather the wine she loves to drink once in a blue moon. With a soft sigh she sat on the counter overlooking the windows–something that the owner's wife had done–Angel sleeping nearby and keeping her company. She relished on the silence for once, knowing that she wasn't by herself, that there was someone else– human –within the house. That gave her enough comfort to go into her own magical world surrounded by trees and magic in the air…and no ounce of evil in the world. Atley came downstairs, yawning, trying to will the sore stiffness from his left leg–actually from his whole body. He woke up in an awkward position on an unknown bed in an unknown room that took him almost half a minute to realize what had happened the night before. He had listened to the house carefully to figure out where Essence had gone before getting out of bed to see if he can get some coffee then ask someone to pick his ass up so he can go home to shower and change. Man, did he really need a cigarette right now! He walked into the kitchen, scratching his head, only to stop and stare at the picture before him, blinking rapidly to see if he was dreaming or not. Because it was very cloudy today–which was very unusual for sunny southern California–there was still enough light peeking through. The light hit a few parts of the kitchen and the young woman sitting at the island, making the scene almost surreal as though Essence wasn't really there–a ghost image of a dream of a dream. He almost snorted, not wanting to disturb the content woman. He didn't know what the hell was wrong with him to make him think like some sort of dumb teenaged sap who didn't know the first thing to do with a woman he was crushing on. Shaking his head to rid those thoughts, he cleared his throat to give away his presences, walking further into the kitchen with a smile at the startled woman. \"Morning, how are you feeling–have you put on some ice on that eye?\" Atley suddenly cried out in surprise when he saw the bruises. However the surprise became anger as he reached out to trace her eye before his own hazel looked down and locked to the hand print upon her neck. Essence quickly reached up and closed the neck of her robe so the man before her wouldn't see the bruises even further. Scowling, Atley turned and opened the freezer, bringing out two bags of frozen vegetables. He then took the two cloths hanging on the oven handle and wrapped them up before handing one to Essence and placing the other upon her eye and cheek. \"Place the other on your neck, don't want the bruises to stay as long as it normally would if you don't place any ice on it.\" he told her softly, holding the back of her head gently. Atley had never felt like killing a man since he started to get along with the younger crew for over a year now...well, actually, he still wants to kill Tumbler and Mirror most of the time when they were bugging him–or when they got together with Chaosia and Sphinx and do a prank on him. Mentally shaking his head he brought his mind back at the task at hand. Atley thought that maybe he should track down the mechanic and just beat the crap out of him like the way he did Essence. Of course he would have to do it in secret so that none of the others would say anything to him about taking it too far. If they were in his shoes they would have done the same thing–they all got along with Essence now that they knew she wasn't a cop! But they all still have that damn idea that he had a crush on the woman–she's at least half his age, damn it ! Without really knowing he had started to stroke his thumb on her uninjured cheek, watching as the woman start to blush and lean into his hands, looking up at him through half-closed lids. Damn, what she did to his insides with just that one look. He was certainly in trouble and needed to put some space between them. He noted how her lips curved just the slightest, wanting to smile, but not doing so. Yes, he needed to put some space between them soon ! Essence did as she was told and placed the bag of frozen vegetables on her neck, loving the close proximity and the gentleness of the man standing next to her. \"Otto called, he wanted to speak with you I think but he didn't tell me to tell you to call him back or anything.\" \"That's fine, I'll call him later.\" Atley told her softly, \"How'd you sleep?\" \"Better than you, I think.\" Essence said, her cheeks turning a tinge of red at the memory of her sleeping on top of him. Atley chuckled, shaking his head. \"Yeah, that's what I get for having fallen asleep. I was going to wait until you had fallen asleep for a half hour before going to sleep on your couch. I guess I was more tired than I thought.\" Essence smiled, \"I just wanted to thank you. I know I was out of it yesterday, but you were patient and very kind with me and…so…thank you.\" Atley shook his head, dropping the frozen vegetables on the counter and taking hold of her face. Oh, how she wish this was happening under different circumstances. She can see the brightness of his hazel eyes before they went dark at some of the anger he held for the man who was about to rape her. Essence wanted her vision to drop down to his lips to compare just how soft they looked or if they were like his hands, calloused but very gentle. She mentally shook her head. She really needed to stop reading so many damn romance novels! \"You have no reason to thank me; I would have gladly beaten the crap out of that idiot and bring you home like I did…though Sphinx got the part of beating the crap out of him, but the truth is I would have gladly done the same thing over again.\" Essence flushed, opening her mouth to reply when the phone rang. She turned brighter yet, quickly dropping the vegetable bag and turning to grab the phone. Atley frowned in both curious and confused before entering the kitchen to make himself a cup of hot coffee. Essence mentally shook her head. What the hell was going on with her? \"Hello?\" \" There's a problem,\" Troy's voice filled her ear. Essence immediately slid off the stool and walked quickly into the living room from her brother's strained voice as his words twisted something inside her. Her only thoughts were that something happened to her treasure–the only other reason of living in this world. She could feel her heart hammering against her chest with dread and anxiousness. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to start over in another state? Maybe she should have just stayed in Chicago to be with her brother. \"What? What's happened? Please, tell me nothing's happened to–?\" she started in panic, willingly the tears to go away. \" No, she's fine, Essence, but that's not the problem. The idiot doesn't want to let Ava go out to visit you.\" Essence sighed with relief, briefly closing her eyes. But as her brother's words snuck in she scowled in anger as she stared out the window. Why does this asshole always tried to make her life miserable? He already made it worse when he didn't let her be in the life of the one person she loved. \"But I have rights ! Does he think me so shallow as to not let her return back to him and his whore?\" Troy sighed. He knew what his sister was going through, and it wasn't fair. But that's why he was her lawyer–and a damn good job at it, he was. He just wished that he had the right evidence to put the asshole that was making his baby sister's miserable life. \" I'll contact the judge and see what I can do, but yes, I believe that's what he thinks.\" Essence exhaled angrily through her nose, pinching the bridge to try and relax. But the anger she was feeling was just eating her away–as was the anxiousness of not seeing the person after such a long time. To think that she had actually liked her ex at one point in her life! \"It's been well over a month because I tried to settle things here, I want to see her!\" Troy sighed sadly, \"I know Elixir. Look, I'll try everything on my end to bring her out there; and if I have to I will personally come with her.\" Essence laughed through the tears she didn't know she had shed. She swiped at them angrily, hating the weakness her ex was putting her through. And he wasn't even here ! She promised that she would never again shed a tear for this man, and here she was doing what she once promised! Maybe she was getting her period, it would explain her emotion rollercoaster…or maybe it had to do with what she was feeling for the older man who was in her kitchen at the moment. She mentally shook her head; it could be she might be wired from the night before. \"The other reason you'll come is so that you can make sure I'm actually doing well on my own here.\" \" That too,\" Troy agreed before laughing. \"Don't worry, your big brother is here and I'll do everything in my power for you to see her.\" \"Thanks Troy, love you.\" \" Love you too, take care.\" Essence sighed, hanging up. She was beyond pissed off and scared–oh, how much she hated her ex-boyfriend. Only he would find ways to make her suffer, and no doubt his new girlfriend was probably helping him in finding new ways too. Essence doesn't understand why his new girlfriend hated her? It's not her fault her ex always spoke about her–all bad, knowing how he was. As long as she didn't touch her treasure, that was all she cared. Then a calmed voice made her jump out of her skin. With the knowledge that her brother might be coming into town she had forgotten all about her houseguest. Despite the calmness Essence did detect the slight anger behind the words. Man, what was wrong with her today? Maybe there wasn't any anger behind the words, it could all just be her imagination…but then, why would she imagine the words to have anger in them? She had enough drama for the day, so why was she trying to make up some more? Maybe she just needed more rest after all that's happened. \"I thought you didn't have a boyfriend?\" Essence turned around to see a neutral-looking Atley; however his eyes were ice cold. Okay, now that couldn't be her imagination. But, then again, no one's eyes could turn that ice cold, right? It's only described in books because the reader can't really see it like in the movies, yet in the movies an actor's eyes don't turn into ice…right? Atley mentally kicked himself for trusting the woman. She had seemed to have lied about having a boyfriend, so what else could she be lying about? It could be that she isn't as innocent as he thought–as they all thought. This woman has been playing them all like fools, and he was the biggest sucker of them all! \"I don't have a boyfriend. That was my brother; he's a lawyer and is doing something for me.\" The words slowly snuck in through his angry and betrayed mind. Immediately Atley looked at her guilty, flushing himself. What an idiot! Didn't she always talk about her lawyer brother when talking to one of the young bloods or Otto? Hell, she even told him little about him at one point or another, how could he have forgotten? Damn, now he felt like an old fool who was a teenager again making his first mistake with a girl he was crushing on! \"Sorry, I've been lied to before by women and I was just hoping you weren't going to turn out like them–and I'm glad you're not.\" His insides twisted as she smiled at him softly. Her mouth might look small but they sure widen whenever she smiled. Atley scolded himself, now he really sounds like a sick love teenager and it needs to stop! \"No problem, have you called Otto back?\" \"Yeah, he just wanted to make sure that you were truly okay and that to make sure you call the hospital to let them know that you weren't coming in tonight.\" Essence sighed dramatically, looking up. Atley couldn't help but chuckle at her, smiling. He knew that Otto meant well–he took a great protectiveness over her–but sometimes when the woman promised to do something she would usually break it to make the other person happy. \"I already gave him my word that I was to relax today, does he not trust me?\" \"As hard as you work, I don't think he does.\" He laughed even harder when Essence stuck her tongue out at him, holding up his hands slightly in surrender. Sometimes he forgets just how young the woman really was compared to his old ass, but it felt good that she makes him forget his age as well. \"Hey, I'm just the messenger here.\" Essence shook her head and dialed her manager at the hospital, knowing that she would have to tell him why, exactly, she wasn't coming in. Knowing just how over protective he is–just like her brother and, recently, Otto–Alan would probably want to file charges himself once he finds out that she has not done so yet. Atley had to leave and had made sure that Essence had locked the door behind him as soon as Donnie came to pick him up. He wasn't comfortable leaving the woman by herself, but at least she would be well guarded with Angel there. Despite the dog being a big softy around his mistress, he was a vicious dog that didn't like strangers–hell, he saw that last night with Sphinx, didn't he? He was just grateful that the big silent man was just as intimidating to dogs as he was to other humans! Except his girlfriend, that is. But she was just as crazy as he was! Overall he couldn't just babysit a grown woman all day; he had things to do to make sure the group has a successful boosts in couple of days! Furthermore Essence seemed to have gotten over the drama pretty well; she was more content in cleaning up her already clean home rather than work. He shook his head, he wondered if all women were crazy like that? If the house was already cleaned, what else is there to clean up! Of course Atley couldn't help but continued to think of her, wondering if she was truly all right or not. The night before Essence seemed strange and hollow, almost as though she were reliving a distant memory. Was it possible that she had gotten rape before? Or close to it? Was that what Essence was thinking about when she was going in and out of her daze when he and Sphinx drove to her home? \"Is that alright with you, Atley?\" Memphis questioned suddenly. Atley looked up at his best friend and leader of the boosts, blinking his eyes. He quickly scanned around the others in the paint docks, watching him carefully and with confusion. He had somehow taken his mind back to the woman rather being there in the present like he needs to be. This life style wasn't as glamorous as some people might think, it was still dangerous and needed your full attention or your or someone was going to get either killed or put in jail. Especially with a newer detective in the GRAB division that seemed to be on their ass and more to the point of getting them off the damn street! Of course, despite what he had missed during the planning Memphis was doing, he still asked the stupid question as his mind tried to catch up with the rest of him. Seriously, what was wrong with him ? \"What?\" Memphis shook his head, smiling as he looked to the others. He was amused with his friend. This is the first time that a woman had made him go crazy like this–not even the woman that Atley dated for half a year before his mom had made him leave town for good. \"Alright, we'll plan some more tomorrow.\" As the others walked away, Sphinx came to stand next to his good friend as Donnie, Sway, Memphis and Otto walked over to him. Atley frowned, wondering what was going on and what exactly did he miss while he was thinking about the wellbeing of the woman that didn't seem to want to leave his head just yet. Maybe he just needs to give her a damn call and get over being worried about her. \"How is Essence really doing, Atley?\" Otto asked, frowning with concern. Atley leaned down slight to rub his right leg. Suddenly it started to throb; he wondered how long it's being doing that since it felt like damn pin needles all over knee. \"She's doing pretty well before I left her, but I get the feeling that she's been through this before.\" The group frowned, concern growing ever more for the young woman that became a good presence within the garage. So Atley told them his suspicion, the four men and woman frowning even further. Despite what they've heard, the older boost knew that if this wasn't her first attack. Essence should have been even more traumatized rather than being calm and collected like she was the day after. Then a soft voice of reason spoke up behind them, her words confusing the group even more. \"She's trying to be strong for someone,\" The group turned to see Sphinx's lover and girlfriend, Chaosia Ripley Guadimus. She smiled to Sphinx, who immediately wrapped his arm around her to bring her close and kiss her deeply. The other men rolled their eyes at the display–though they were used to it already as they've been going out for almost a year; and not to mention gone through so much crap. Sway smiled mischievously, wishing she hadn't left her phone in the car or her camera at home. She should have known better since the couple would show a small type of affection whenever they were around in public in the beginning. With a content sigh, the young woman looked to the group, leaning even further into Sphinx (if that was even possible). No matter how different–in every sense of height, personality, and just about everything else–they looked, and are, good with each other. Hell, it does help that the things they do have in common completes each other. \"It does sound like she's been through this once before, but this girl seems like she's trying to be strong for someone.\" \"Like who? She lives alone and her brother lives in Chicago,\" Otto said in confusion. Chaosia shrugged, \"I don't know, could be someone that we might not even know.\" Atley shook his head, sighing tiredly. All this round-around about the woman being strong for an invisible person was making his head hurt and just making him even more confused. \"No, it has to be something else. Why would a person try to stay strong for a person that's not even here to see her break down?\" Chaosia raised an eyebrow, grinning that grin of hers. Sometimes Atley needed to just shut his mouth and leave things alone because Chaosia loves to speak in riddles with him! She probably knows it annoys him and does it for her damn amusement. \"And who said that that person wasn't here?\" The group looked at her before she leaned up and kissed Sphinx's cheek and walked away to leave the group–and more importantly, Atley–to think over her words. It was very obvious that the woman Atley had a crush on wanted to be strong for Atley because she, too, has a crush on the older man. Chaosia shook her head, smiling. Even her lover knew that and his good friend was just plain an idiot and didn't see what was in front of him. Hopefully he would see and wouldn't let it get away; it would do him some good that was for sure. A/N: Sorry for the late update, drama at work and now we're one manager down and my store manager just went on bed rest and won't be at work until her maternity leave ends in August, AND I'm training to be a first assistant. So you guys are going to have to be patient with me! The writer's block doesn't help either. Please review and, again, please be patient. Oh, and I dedicate this chapter to LauRa-ReaDinG-XoX for reminding I still have other stories out there! :)[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: Chaosia Ripley Guadimus belongs to Chaosia Guadimus (I really recommend reading her stories if you haven't yet!) as does Marston 'Mars' Rivers Healing Hands Chapter 5 After a few days of forced relaxation–though she was content to call it the guilt ridden isolation that it actually was but whatever–Essence finally returned to work, her bruising still evident even with the constant icing and heat wraps to elevate the swelling. Just like the super-duty cover up was failing to cover the horrible dark blotches against her skin. God why could nothing work the way it was supposed to? Yet in spite of the concern and looks, the whispers and very thinly veiled attempts to avoid the elephant in the room–and all from the damn parking lot gate to spots before the door!–Essence trudged right through the doors of Halliwell Restoration like her name was on the building. She didn't want any of these people to see her as fragile or worse the stereotypical woman that couldn't defend herself. She'd dealt with that enough before and she was officially sick of it. She knew with her precious treasure she couldn't afford to be defenseless or weak–not again at least. All her life she was protected and cared for, despite her small rebellions and constant attempts to break away from that very label. Something neither her brother nor her ex had helped her do. They hadn't wanted her to be on her own, always trying to prevent mishaps and avert 'the catastrophes she attracted like moths to flames'. And though she could consent that their motives were worlds apart they had the same agenda–to ensure she was always the damsel in distress. And that one of them would always be handy to play the role of White Knight Saviour. With a shake of her head to rid of the thoughts about her past Essence parked in her usual spot next to the Shelby. Smiling, she quickly took out her iPod and started to scroll through her music list as she inserted the earphones. Hopefully this would keep the few brave ones from trying to shower her with pity and apologies–because she knew that she was probably one of the last ones here. Otto and his friends were always at the shop early–not that it was any of her business–and it would only be a matter of time before the people Atley had kept from calling started piling in the office to 'check on her'. She sighed, her brows furrowing on their own as she considered exactly what she'd landed herself in. She knew that this group–these mechanics–met up for other reasons than just to work on the cars in their care. She just didn't know why . . . Shrugging she tried to push the though from her head. If she continued to let them be then they would do the same for her. But it was kind of insulting to know that despite the easy way they all got along she still wasn't 'in' with the group, an outsider looking in through muddied windows at a bigger picture she just couldn't quite make out. Essence stopped for a second, confused at her own thoughts. Why would she be included? She hardly sees these people outside of her work–both works–and she knew that the main reason they were so agreeable was because they were–generally–just as personable as she is…even if it had taken some of them a while to warm to her. With her music blasting and her thoughts settled Essence made her way towards the garage, unlocking the door with her key. Otto had told her to keep the spare key even after she had cleaned out the office. \"Just in case.\" She shrugged, moving in the fairly still room. Singing along with the song that had started beneath her breath, she locked the door behind her; the sound barely audible over the melody playing in her ears. Which is why when she turned around she shrieked, clutching her chest before laughing. Tumbler was standing right behind her–grinning roguishly as scooped her up; swinging her around once before setting her back on her feet. Essence flushed brightly as she smacked his shoulders, tugging out her earphones as she willed her heart to beat at a normal rate once again. \"What the hell, Tumbler? You scared the crap out of me!\" Tumbler merely chuckled, placing his hands in his pockets as he rocked back on his heels almost innocently. He grinned mischievously at her, Essence narrowing her eyes with suspicion. Despite that she didn't find him attractive the twenty-seven year old was indeed handsome, if albeit a bit flirty and touchy-feeling. And in her short time among the odd group she'd learned that look–from either Tumbler or the youngest Raines–was one to fret over. It almost always meant they were up to something. Essence sighed exasperatedly, about to yell at him when she noticed Toby shaking his head just behind Tumbler as Chaosia walked towards them with a frown. Grinning, Essence took a step back; leaving Tumbler to look her over suspiciously. Right before he yelped; him bobbing forward just enough to make her wince as the blonde shrugged away from her, turning to level an incredulous glare at whoever had smacked him. Chaosia stood scant inches from where he'd been her arms crossed and a decidedly bored glare directed at Tumbler. But as the girl shifted on her feet Essence had to fight the urge to fidget. She got along with Chaosia, what with the two of them being in the same age group but Essence could admit to envying her, feeling even more like plain Jane just standing in the same area. But then again Sway had the same effect on her, the platinum blonde in her leathers and layers the very epitome of confidence and capability. God working here was going to give her a freaking complex . . . if she didn't commit murder or completely refurbish her wardrobe just to stay up first. Mentally shaking herself Essence occupied herself with powering the iPod down and stashing it in her purse. While Tumbler whined to Chaosia as he rubbed the back of his head. Falling into the habit the younger workers had of calling her by her middle name instead of her first. \"Come on, Ripley, it was just a joke!\" \"A joke that scared her half to death! Now leave Essence alone and let her get started on the day. She actually does work around here, unlike some people.\" Essence moved towards the stairs, leaning into Toby who hugged her around the waist. She placed her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes tiredly, fighting a yawn as he squeezed her tighter. God she really needed some caffeine in her soon! Toby tugged the younger woman closer, not overly concerned with missing the meeting quietly proceeding over at the painting docks. He and Tumbler had just walked down the stairs from the private office–to try and find some information for their next list that seemed to elude the others–when they'd spotted Essence locking the main door behind her. Toby had sighed and told–nay begged–Tumbler to let her be so they could go back to the meeting and not get in any more trouble when his friend had decided to scare her instead. He sighed, cutting his eyes to her as she covered her mouth; yawning quietly into her hand. His eyes traced the bruises shining stubbornly through the makeup and Toby knew that he would rather miss the meeting–though he figured that Memphis had wondered what was taking so long when Chaosia had eased up behind them. Taking in the situation and stalking past him to cuff the back of Tumbler's head after the other boost dropped Essence. He'd noticed the similarities between him and the girl before; trying to go out of his way to make her feel welcomed. And he knew that that was the reason they got along so well–aside from being close in age. \"How are you doing, Essence?\" he asked softly, walking up the stairs. Essence sighed, looking up at the taller boy as he grinned despite himself. Something he and Mirror had been thrilled over at first. Even Chaosia was their height, her usual heels making her even taller. But Essence was petite enough that he and the other vertically challenged boosts didn't feel silly standing next to her. \"I'm doing as well as I can be, Tech. I just really need some coffee.\" Toby's grin blossomed into a full blown smile at the nickname, a few chuckles escaping his throat as he shook his head. Otto Halliwell was a great man, one who had accomplished various impressive sorted deeds in his lifetime–even though only about half were of the legal variety. But he had proved that even he had shortcomings to overlook, his sheer laziness–okay unwillingness–in replacing certain extremely outdated office technology manifesting scant days after Essence had started. Which had led to her having problems with the resident dinosaur–er computer. He'd stepped in and fixed it; overclocking the processor and fabbing a water cooling unit–so the thing wouldn't burn to ash in the months Chaosia predicted it would take her and Junie to grind Otto down enough to cave. Which had led her to fondly dub him Tech , Essence deferring to the nickname more often than not. Not that he cared. He actually liked the name over young blood or kid . Of course he was used to being called kid or young blood, but Tech was definitely nice to hear once in a while. Especially since it meant someone actually understood that he was talented in the technical department...and not just able to hack into any system Memphis needed him to. \"I'll make you a cup while you boot up that damn dinosaur.\" Toby smirked as Essence laughed, doing just that as he fought the coffee pot. He turned, watching as Tumbler pushed into the office subdued; dropping down into one of the chairs in front of the desk with a huff as Ripley gracefully sank into the other. Well it looks like none of them were going to go back to that meeting. His smirk widening, Toby turned back to the side table closer to the door and started the coffee pot, making a note to have Ripley aggravate Otto into getting a new one. He'd cave on the coffee pot before he would the computer after all. After the meeting Memphis had tasked Atley with looking for the three people that had flaked half an hour before. Though, Memphis did trust Chaosia to do her part in three nights even without being at the meeting. Nodding to the group as they entered the main area, Otto moving to open the doors for both business and his non-boost workers, Atley rushed up the stairs. He stopped a second, letting his leg rest before he pushed into the office; stopping as he realized he'd just walked into the middle of something. Essence was leaning against her desk and laughing with Chaosia, Tumbler, and Toby. The computer genius was actually leaning against Essence–who didn't seem to mind at all. Actually the girl was leaning more into the geek then the older boost liked or cared to see. Chaosia tilted her head back, glancing over her shoulder to see who had come in before smirking knowingly. Though it wasn't as pronounced as she'd like, she was at least glad that Atley was showing some sort of reaction when it came to Essence being around other men. It was easy to see he fancied her–even if they couldn't quite place it themselves just yet. She rolled her eyes, trying not to snort as she fought to keep her grin contained. Now if only he would actually do something about it and not be as stubborn as her lover–though if he and Sphinx were able to be friends it probably was possible he was just as stubborn and hard headed as the brooding idiot. Probably more so when it came to someone he cared about. \"Well Atley, what brings you into the office?\" Essence glanced up, her smile brightening before she looked down; her hair falling over the most severe bruising on her face, hiding it almost completely from view. Atley felt something buried inside him tighten at that look but tried to keep his composure. It wouldn't do to show what he was feeling–even when he didn't know what it was himself. But as he glanced down to the practically preening boost he had a feeling that Chaosia already knew. He narrowed his eyes at her slightly, fighting back a curse as her own little smirk darkened. Of course she would pick up on him fighting himself whenever he was around Essence. He just hoped she took a page from Sphinx's book and kept quiet about it. Though he knew–in the back of his mind–that she was planning something; trying to figure out how to exploit the weakness she'd picked up on. And by God he hated it; she was worse than he and her boy ever had time to be. \"Um, I came to speak with Essence.\" Atley raised an eyebrow when the group continued to stare at him, trying to deliberately ignore Chaosia's smug look. \"If that's all right with you guys?\" The group turned to Essence, asking her if she wanted to leave them alone, making Atley's face darken into a scowl. Why wouldn't she want them to be alone together? Essence however shrugged, looking up through her hair and her lashes with a soft smile. Toby wrapped an arm around her and hugged her tightly, whispering into her ear quickly before kissing her cheek. Essence laughed at whatever he said, nodding as the group started to walk out. Chaosia winked at her before smiling brightly at Atley who looked at her suspiciously, his eyes narrowing again she wiggled her fingers at him before leaving. \"Behave kiddies. Don't do anything I wouldn't do . . .\" Essence shook her head at the other woman and quickly began to shift through some of the paperwork that piled up from the day before, waiting for the older man to speak first. She was grateful that Chaosia had filled in for her despite that she had her own business–which Essence forgot the name of its location but knew it was a bit on the high society class…maybe Wake Beach? Well what she did remember about the shop was that the first floor had to do with clothes and the second floor a salon, which Chaosia's best friend handled. Atley shut the door and held the chair that Tumbler had vacated, watching the woman move to pace the room nervously, biting her lip as she went about to work. Now, how to say what he wanted to say without looking like a total idiot? He knew that–like everyone else–asking her how she was and maybe she should go back home would probably just upset her. And since he was positive that Toby had at least asked about her wellbeing he didn't want to sound like a broken record. But he was concerned for the woman; and more to the point confused over how calmly she's been since the attack. Essence could practically see what Atley was thinking and smiled ruefully before rolling her eyes. She was typing–or at least trying to type up the reports from the day before–watching the older man from the corner of her eye. She watched him shake his head and move around the chair to sit in it, stretching out his long legs before him. He rubbed his right knee, letting Essence know that he was having trouble with his leg again. Just like she knew she shouldn't say anything because she knew he would be embarrassed. Even if she always wondered how he got that limp but was afraid of him shutting down. \"I really am all right, Atley. I needed to come back; I was suffocating in my own house !\" Essence got up with the now typed–therefore legible–paperwork and started to place them in their proper home within the filing cabinet, trying not to let the inevitable conversation sour her mood. Atley had been on her case about her return to work almost nonstop and it was grating on her last nerve. Why couldn't the man just leave her in peace so she could finally start to work through the restlessness the attack four days ago had left her with? Moving back to the desk Essence picked up a sheet covered in grease. She eyed the sheet skeptically before she spotted the cluster of others, the sight actually causing her to sigh in relief. Since the others couldn't seem to keep any paperwork clean she would have to redo it . . . meaning she might have an escape for the world of attempted rapes, hassling exes and aggravating but caring older men–namely her brother and a certain someone sulking in front of her. She closed her eyes, trying to banish the slightly hateful thought. She knew he meant well–hell so did Troy–so she needed to cut them some slack. She wasn't going to let them victimize her or force her back to her damsel role but she didn't have to be hateful. Even if Atley's next words made her want to bash his head with the archaic keyboard. Hey, maybe if she broke it Otto would buy a new one. \"Are you sure ? Because those bruises are pretty dark still. Even with the make-up.\" Flushing hot, Essence brushed her hair over her shoulder, covering the hand print around her neck as her bangs covered the entire left side of her face; shielding her black eye and battered cheek from further scrutiny. She chose to ignore the man and quickly stood, the grease stained papers in hand. It didn't matter how many hours she spent trying to decipher those damn things she never would figure it out. So she would just have to track down each mechanic and have them tell her everything they remembered–which was usually only about seventy five percent of what was on the original report. And after that she could finally just give up and file it away until they remembered the rest. Note to self: invent grease proof carbon copy paper and educate the male mechanics on the necessity of washing their hands. Sway–and Chaosia the scant few times she'd helped Sphinx on one of their cars–could both remember to wash off the sludge. So the men should be just as capable. \"I need to go find Otto and–\" she looked to the name on the next sheet, rolling her eyes at Donnie and Kip's names sloppily written side by side \"–Donnie and Kip. You can stay or go if you want, but I do have work to do Atley.\" She saw him flinch at her words and felt a flicker of remorse as she pushed out of the office. She hadn't meant to snap at him, but aside from all the questioning and concern from everyone–and the whispered conversations she just knew were going on behind her back–Essence was on edge. Troy still hadn't called her back and she was starting to worry about never seeing her treasure again. The woman was brought out of her thoughts to see two men looking around in the main restoration area. Frowning at them suspiciously, she made her way down the stairs; her stiletto heels announcing her approach long before either were able to see her. Although wary she placed a professional smile, thinking that they may be potential cliental. She was very grateful that she had worn black straight trousers with a casual grey cashmere sweater that was off the shoulders. Even though Otto had told her that she could wear casual clothes–had hinted that he might prefer her in the jeans and shirts and sneakers–Essence still liked to look as professional as she could. Maybe it was a throwback from the dress code in her previous retail employment or a habit that she couldn't break. Either way today it was going to work in her favor. \"Welcome to Halliwell Restoration, gentlemen. May I help you?\" The two turned to face her and Essence felt her breath catch in her throat. The older man had dark, rich skin and a stern face; though his lips were spread in a warm and respectful smile. But the younger of the two is who caught her attention. She knew that he was out of her league, but she couldn't help the shy smile tugging at her lips. But who could blame her? She was sure any red-blooded woman would love how his dark hair and tanned skin brought out the color of his eyes. He looked her over, his eyes taking on a slightly darker tint. Which of course made her think something that she later kicked herself for; flushing in embarrassment at corrupting the small part from the story Little Red Riding hood . 'My, oh, my , what green eyes you have.' Marston Rivers–or Mars to his friends and colleagues–continued to shift in the passenger seat as his boss (and lead detective of the GRAB unit) Roland Castlebeck drove towards their current destination. Halliwell Restoration. Two days ago their desk had been swamped with theft reports and copies of insurance claims–the apparent aftermath of a thirty car sheet that had been run within the Long Beach limits. Everything Mars had–every instinctual part of him practically screamed what Castlebeck had already voiced. The entire stunt reeked of Randall 'Memphis' Rains and his ragtag crew of boosts. Of course they had to prove it first. Hearing the aggravated sigh next to him Mars stopped fidgeting. Part of almost always listening to his instincts had made him damned good at interpreting the moods and emotions of the people around him. Normally it served him pretty well–from being able to spot a lie to knowing when a perp was more dangerous than they looked. But another benefit was that he knew when he crossed a line, and he was very close to trampling over the thin red barrier containing Castlebeck's patience. The lead detective's jaw set hard as they rounded the corner into the lot; parking next to the rather infamous in-construction Shelby with a snort and roll of his eyes. Mars went to open the door when his boss stopped him; clamping a hand on his arm firm enough to make him look back. Castlebeck was a good guy–a great detective–but sometimes even Mars found himself scared shitless when the hint of anger would show beneath his calm words. \"I'll do all the talking, you got me Mars? You're only here to observe how we handle things since you just got transferred three weeks ago.\" Not really able to find his voice Mars just nodded instead, knowing that he was testing him in more ways than just being able to follow instructions. After looking at him for a long time Castlebeck gave a curt nod and got out, Mars quickly following as he shed his coat and secured his piece. He knew that Drycoff would probably give him hell for leaving his jacket in the back seat but it was a hot fucking day. And not all of them had the luxury of being sequestered to an air conditioned courtroom to testify. The two detectives walked through the open doors of the garage, keen eyes taking in all every small detail while they kept their ears trained to even the most mundane conversations. Who knew how many members Memphis would have in his crew and one of them was bound to slip up one way or another. They moved slowly towards the stairs, looking over the cars to see if they recognized any of them that were stolen. If he remembered correctly Otto used to own a chop-shop way back when, and it's possible that it was going on again. The click of heels on the stairs behind them made the two detectives turn to see a woman neither recognized. Mars raised a brow as Castlebeck stilled; his eyes flitting over her quickly, noting that despite the casual feel of the garage the woman–girl really. Christ she looked like she just barely out of her teens– was dressed overly professional. The edges of Mars lips flickered upwards when he saw a red spot on her right cheek, her light brown hair covering her neck and left side of the face. He suddenly wanted to push the thick silken curtain back to see how just long her neck was. To investigate if her whole body would flush if he were to kiss and nip her lovely bronze skin. His eyes flicked down, trailing over her neck; her bare shoulders didn't look bad either. Despite the heels the girl was short; barely reaching his shoulders as she shifted from foot to foot before him. How petite-how tiny was she without them? Would she even come to his chest? And how did her legs still look long enough to wrap around his torso? Mentally scolding himself and shaking his head, Mars listened to her soft, quiet voice. She was very shy around newcomers, he noticed. \"Welcome to Halliwell Restoration, gentlemen. May I help you?\" \"Detective Castlebeck and Detective Rivers. We were wondering if it was all right to speak with either Otto Halliwell or Randal Raines?\" The woman smiled softly, if not warily at them; nodding after she looked at Castlebeck's credentials. She held out her arm holding a sheet of paper, her body turned to lead them. Mars stilled as her eyes met his; shocked by the surprisingly light color. Quicksilver irises displayed an array of emotion, swirling with a not quite blue until it was hard to look away. Jesus, with eyes like that–and a voice like quicksand he knew he was in trouble. This was the kind of woman–the kind of instant attraction and chemistry–that didn't let you go. Even if you wanted it to. \"Right this way, detectives.\" Mars raised a brow before his lips actually stretched into a grin, tilting his head to the side as he watched her backside; tracking her hips swaying. The sweater she was wrapped in fell around her thighs but was still tight enough to show her figure. And what a wonderful figure it was . . . Castlebeck rolled his eyes and elbowed the younger man, glaring at him in warning. Mars however just continued to grin, shrugging. He was man after all and the woman leading them deeper into the boost's den was well worth watching. They walked all the way towards the back where they noticed the two men they came to see speaking in low voices near a marked calendar and a table of tools. Were they talking about another boost? If so, when in the hell did they plan to move? It would be so much easier if they could take them all down at the scene of the crime . . . but apparently that was too much to hope for. The conversation came to a halt as soon as the woman spoke; the two men almost immediately freezing-before they turned to them with an emotion Mars couldn't completely decipher. Not that it really mattered- he knew that they were rattled. Mars almost grinned before he caught himself; he wanted far more than to rattle them and he would insure that happened very soon. Walking towards the painting bay with the two detectives behind her, Essence couldn't help but try not to blush. She was quickly able to see how toned the younger detective was–okay that was an understatement, the man had muscle! And not of the bulging gross variety. The man wasn't bulky-just built and lithe with this hard edge to him that almost reminded her of Sphinx. Though that could've been just from his sheer height–even with her tallest heels on her feet he still towered over her. A hard thing not to notice. Breathe. Essence lectured herself, trying to slow her beating heart. She's seen hot men before, so why was this one so different? Perhaps her nerves were due to him being a cop. She tried not to rush her steps, to keep her pace even and steady but who was she kidding? These cops were really making her nervous! She almost sighed with relief when she entered the painting bay, quickly spotting the two men the two cops wanted to speak with. \"Otto, there's two detectives that wish to speak with you and Randall.\" Essence said loudly over the noise of the other workers still painting cars. Essence watched both Otto and Memphis looked over towards them with a look she couldn't decipher and didn't really care to do so. But it was quickly replaced with calmness in just seconds, the two men looking like their everyday normal selves. \"Thanks Essence,\" Otto nodded with a smile. With a nod of her own she went to turn away and go back to work when she circled back. She desperately wanted to be away from these two cops and away from the tension she was feeling with these four men in general–it was almost suffocating. Due to her wanting to be away she felt foolish of having forgotten the reason she came to find Otto and–having taken a look at the calendar–give him her schedule for the hospital. \"Oh and when you're able to can you please translate this?\" Otto grinned as he took the stained sheet. \"Sure thing kiddo, I'm actually done for the day so after I speak with these detectives I'll come find you.\" Out of habit because she hates her hair near her face Essence shook back her hair. She smiled gratefully at Otto. \"Thanks Otto and I'll be returning to the hospital next week and I should have my full schedule by then.\" \"What the–? Who the hell did that?\" Mars suddenly cried angrily. He took Essence's arm to turn her to face him and angled her head so he can see the bruise hand print better. It was then that he saw the black eye and bruises on her cheek and brushed her bangs away. Essence's breath was caught in her throat when she watched his light green eyes darken with anger she knew was coursing through him. What was it about handsome men with the urge to protect her that made her feel like a giddy teenager? Not even with her ex did she feel like this–but then again he was more of the aggressive over protector type not the knight in shining armor type she felt from the cop and Atley. \"Did you report the asshole that did that miss?\" Roland asked calmly, if icily. Essence flushed, hating the attention she was getting. The mechanic's did not question but she knew that it had to do with Otto saying something to them–as the younger men and Chaosia for they seem to be even more protective and hanging around her more. Now she hoped there will be no trouble or even pressured from these two cops for Atley and Otto had told her that the mechanic had gotten what he deserved. And she chose not to question it. \"She didn't report it,\" Otto answered just as calmly and icily. \"But the man was fired and got what he deserved.\" Roland, seeing the anger behind the words–and meaning–nodded appreciated. Mars, however, seemed like he wanted to object but Essence didn't want to continue with the conversation. She cleared her throat and stepped away from Mars, bright red with embarrassment. \"Ex-excuse me, but I have to go back to work.\" And she nearly ran out of the painting bay. A/N: Okay, long wait I'm sorry! But I got a new job as an assistant manager and I don't really have time to type up many of what I've written down. Thank you to Chaosia Guadimus for graciously editing the last bit (I love you, thank you for doing this for me!). Thank you all for reading, please review and let me know what you think! :)[Chapter 6] Healing Hands Chapter 6 \"Are you sure you don't want to go out and party with us, Raines?\" Mirror Man grinned mischievously. He had decided not to leave the garage as quickly as Sphinx had. Then again, the large British man did have a job outside of what they do and had just gotten off work when they had that meeting. He also thought it weird that Sphinx would leave before Ripley. Usually the man would be at her side or just wait for her. But there was Ripley talking with Sway about God knows what. Mirror shuddered to think what those two have planned or are planning… \"I'm sure man, I just want to go home and relax.\" Kip replied from beneath the red '66 Ford Mustang GT. He loves his friends, he did, but lately he's been restless. The partying, the drinking, and the women every night just wasn't working out for him anymore. Yeah, boosting still keeps up his adrenaline, but when he was home it just didn't feel right anymore. He felt almost…alone? He had noticed how much time he's been spending with others just so he wouldn't be home alone. But it was getting old, too; he wanted some peace and quiet. Hearing quick heels on the cement floor–even over all the damn noise–Kip shook his head to rid of the thoughts as Mirror turned to see Essence walking briskly from the paint area in the back. He whistled low, Kip grunting and shoving from beneath the classic. \"Damn, I seriously wish I can tap that! What the hell is Atley waiting for?\" Glaring at the shorter man, Kip stood and cuffed the back of his head, making Mirror cry out. Serves him right to be speaking about Essence like that around him. Hell, he and Tumbler should know better. Luckily for him the only other ones that have his back is Toby and Freb…but Freb is kind of weird. Shaking his head Kip went to greet the younger woman when he noticed the distress look she wore. Frowning himself Kip called out to her, wiping his hands on an already dirty rag. Essence skid to a stop, turning to him. He motioned her over, wondering if he can try and make her happy–and to see how the bruises looked. How much he wanted to beat the mechanic that did that to her, Kip was just glad that it was Sphinx that took care of it. Thank God, Sphinx was the best at knowing how to torture a man…aside from Ripley. Actually they were both up there in torturing someone. With a shake of his head Kip smiled, watching as Essence looked down at her hand holding some crumble papers, her distress look became a glower look as she turned in his direction. Uh-oh, now's he done it, Kip knew as his smile faded. And he knew damn well what he was in trouble for. Damn . Seriously, what was the matter with her? She was acting like a damn teenager that found out her crush knew her existence! With a sigh Essence decided to just hide out in the office and until the two detectives leave. That's what she was good at, wasn't it? Hiding away like a coward? God, she needed to stop thinking like her ex wanted her to think! She was free of him, she started a new life ! But she really was embarrassed for that hot Detective to have noticed the bruises on her neck and face. \"Essence!\" The woman nearly slipped in her heels as she came to a quick stop from her name being yelled out. Turning she saw Kip and Mirror Man–what was his real name?–standing by a gleaming red '66 Ford Mustang. Kip motioned her over, but all she wanted to do was go to the office and work away. It wasn't really hiding…right? Her left hand fisting Essence looked down to see the stained paperwork. With a glare, she looked towards Kip and beeline towards him. Thank God he reminded her why she was on the ground floor. Oh, he was going to get a piece of her mind because this was just getting ridiculous ! Kip gulped visibly and took a step back when she got in his personal bubble. Good, she wanted him to be as uncomfortable as possible, maybe then he will learn and remember! \"How hard is it to wash your damn hands or even wipe off the grease on a damn rag before writing out the paperwork?\" Essence stabbed her finger into his chest after every word. \"It takes twice as long to finish my work because of yours and every other man's forgetfulness to wash and wipe your greasy hands !\" Kip bumped back into his toolbox, rubbing furiously at his chest as he stared wide eyes at Essence. Who the hell was this woman and what happened to the sweet, shy and quiet Essence? He wanted her back, not this crazed woman! She thrust his sheet of paperwork into his chest–Kip scrambling to take hold of it–and placed her hands on her hips. \"Next time the paperwork better be clean, Kip. I mean it, there will be consequences!\" At his frantic nod Essence turned around to scan the other mechanics as both Chaosia and Sway laughed, leaning against each other. Her lips twitched but made sure to keep the amusement from her face; perhaps the other mechanics listening will take note and not stain the damn paper anymore and make her life easier. Perhaps her nervousness and the way her emotions whirled in confusion with Detective Rivers is what was helping her act like this? Whatever the reason she liked being in charged and mean towards these men. \"Where's Donnie?\" A tool dropping was heard right next to Kip's station, Donnie poking his head from the other side of the black '55 Chevrolet Nomad with a sheepish look. Essence raised an eyebrow, holding back her smile; oh, watching a man squirm was truly a great thing to see. \"Look, I'm sorry kid, but you know my wife's pregnant, right? And she gave me a scare yesterday. You know this is the first time my paperwork was stained…\" Donnie had the decency to flush at Essence's other raised eyebrow, \"More than usual.\" Walking towards the older man Essence did smirk when the older man flinched as she held out his stained paperwork. Oh, she does love having some power over men; even if it just means for a little bit. However she softened at the mention of his wife. It was their first child and Donnie was a nervous wreck. Essence smiled sadly at that; he reminded her of Troy whom she had lived with since leaving her ex and pregnant with her treasure. \"How is Sheila doing?\" she asked softly. Donnie sighed with relief as he took the sheet of paper. Damn, even shy, quiet Essence was scary when pissed off. He was just glad that she didn't drill him as she did Kip–must be a woman thing when it comes to other women being pregnant. \"She's great, just anxious to see her feet again.\" Essence laughed, brushing her bangs over her left side. Oh, the joys of being pregnant…a better joy would be pregnant and in love. She knew better, yes she did. She now knew the difference between smitten and real love…because love she's never experienced just read them and seen them in other people. Essence mentally shook her head. Man, she needed to get a grip of herself. She did not need a guy to make her happy. That's why she has her treasure and her brother…and her hyper dog Angel. \"Tell her as soon as she gives birth her feet won't matter anymore. That all she'll ever care and worry about will always be her son.\" Donnie smiled but frowned with curiosity. How would Essence know about that? He looked at her closely. There's no indicating that she ever gave birth before–then again she does run in the mornings. They've seen her run by the garage–which was a couple of good miles away from her home–every day before coming into work. Maybe she just knew someone who had given birth?...Or maybe it was another woman thing. \"I'll tell her,\" Donnie responded just as softly. With a smile and a nod, Essence quickly moved towards the stairs, mentally kicking herself. Of all the things to say! They can't know about her treasure, for all she knew they might know about her ex. Essence stopped within the office with a frown. Of course they don't know about her ex or else they would have threatened her already. She just needs to calm down, she's just anxious…right? With a sigh Essence went over to her desk, noting that Atley has left. Feeling dishearten, the young woman straighten her shoulders and went to work. He does have a life outside of the garage, and perhaps a job; so why would he stick around? For her ? Yeah, right. Atley went into the private office after Essence showed the GRAB Detective Castlebeck to the back–most likely he wanted to speak with either Otto or Memphis or both . He frowned as he stared out of the windows in the private office to see Essence had returned flushed and preoccupied. Then he grinned when he heard her giving Kip a good scolding for whatever reason, laughing at how scared the boy looked. Who knew the small woman would look so fierce scolding–and very attractive to him. Of course the latter didn't register to Atley as he was too amused by what was happening–and rightfully ignored. He returned back to the chair and stretched out his long legs, drinking the beer he opened. He didn't want to go home–it was starting to get lonely in his apartment. There was no way he was going to bother Sphinx, the man looked dead on his feet at the meeting. Even Ripley knew it since she was still hanging around there and talking with Sway rather having followed her lover back to their home to be with him. By noon Atley decided to take Essence out for lunch, his treat. Throwing away his fourth empty beer bottle Atley rose to drag Essence out of the office when Ripley pushed him back inside, closing the door to a crack. She had a grin he did not like upon her lips as her eyes shone brightly. God, she was becoming too much like Sphinx! They did not need another one like him. \"Unless you value your privacy I suggest you stay put.\" \"What?\" Atley frowned confused. What the hell is she talking about? He's known Memphis as long as Otto and even they don't know half the things in his life. \"A detective from GRAB had returned but to speak with Essence.\" Atley froze, his look darkening. Not too long after the detectives left did Memphis come up to the private office and told him about Castlebeck and some other detective had come that morning to see where they were two days ago. And since Essence took them to both Otto and Memphis, maybe they think she was part of the boost world, especially since they don't recognize her? Damn, he hoped that wasn't the case! Essence was filing away when she heard a knock. Calling the person to enter, she found the folder she was looking for and put in the two documents. Plastering a smile she closed the drawer and turned to the person only to freeze on the spot. Smiling, oh so sexy, and leaning against the door jab was Detective Rivers, his hands in his pockets. Essence gulped at the sight of how muscular he really was and how much she wanted to just run and hide. Consciously she brushed her hair further around her neck to hide the bruises. Why does this man make her so damn nervous? \"Detective, what can I do for you?\" She felt, and saw, his eyes roam over her face before they settled on her neck. Feeling her face begin to turn red she cleared her throat and moved towards her desk, quickly locking the computer. It was a habit she had picked up while living around her concerned–and noisy–older brother; plus she didn't want cliental information out in the open. \"I can show you to Otto if you like. I believe Mr. Rains had left for lunch already.\" she trailed off at the raised eyebrow he had, \"Habit. I lock the computer so no one can see the cliental information.\" Mars nods, knowing that that was a good explanation. Plus it seemed that the woman was sincere about keeping other's information private which was good for business…and not just the legal one too. \"I actually came to see you.\" Essence looked up at him startled, frowning. \"Did you have questions for me?\" Mars smiled, \"Just one: Want to go to lunch with me?\" Essence could feel her confusion, as well as a bit of excitement. This man, who was out of her league, was asking her to lunch? She wondered if she had fallen asleep and was having a nice dream about this man. Oh, if only. She bit her lip, glancing towards the garage below before she shrugged; nodding to him once as she smiled to him bashfully. What the hell; she had to eat right? And if all of this really was some kind of dream then she'd wake up to some drool covered paperwork and no damage done. \"Sure, Detective . . . just let me get my things.\" Mars couldn't help the grin; looked like luck was on his side for once. Sitting at a table in the mom and pop restaurant, Mars watched as a fascinated Essence continue to look around her. The small building was out of the way from the main streets with a friendly staff service and great homemade food that was quick and fresh (they buy fresh produce every morning), the recipes a family secret and handed down for generations. Inside held many black and white photographs of ancestors dating back to the Wild West and gold rush eras. There were also a few antique items that were both personal and priceless in cabinets or hanging on the wall for all to see. Mars found the place when he first moved to Long Beach and got lost, having ended up in Palos Verdes. And he remembered the place ever since. Although it was a bit off from where Halliwell's Restorations was, it was very popular all the same. It not only gave off a homey feel to it, but it also gave the sense of privacy without so much effort. Like some of the high-end restaurants in L.A. Mars smiled warmly when Essence sighed almost wistfully, a bit deep in thought. As soon as they were seated they spoke about themselves and the move to Long Beach. However he did noticed that Essence was vague on some of her answers and felt almost uncomfortable. But he didn't pry any further; wanting to gain her trust and–hopefully she wasn't involve–get a person inside the Halliwell operations. \"This really is a lovely place, and I'm grateful you brought me here.\" Essence told him softly sincere. Mars smiled back, leaning back, almost relaxed. \"Not a problem, I'm glad to share it with a beautiful woman.\" Essence snorted with a roll of his eyes, \"You already convinced me to come out for lunch with you, Mars.\" The detective smiled wider at the sound of his name coming out of her lips. He liked it. They both thank the waitress for clearing their plates and ordered coffee as they still had time. And Mars really wanted to ask about the garage. He wanted to catch these boost of thieves, especially the infamous Randall 'Memphis' Rains. Through hell and Castlebeck he will get some answers. \"Did your employers really deal with the guy that hit you? Do you know how?\" Essence started at the question, flushing and unconsciously moving her hair in front of her bruises. \"All I remember was them saving me; I don't remember much after.\" she told him truthfully, a bit tense from the question. Mars frowned but continued to push his way anyways, his mind set already in getting some answers. \"Have you ever noticed anything suspicious or weird going on around the garage?\" Essence frowned herself, her back stiff as a board, as her thoughts went to the group being at the garage so early or Atley coming to see Otto in the afternoon or close to locking up. They even stayed there after closing, Otto and/or Chaosia assuring her that they will close up. \"The only thing weird I've seen would be some of the men–and, sometimes, women–coming in to drop off or pick up their car, that's all.\" Mars shook his head in disbelief, leaning forward and begin to demand the answers he desperately wanted. \"Are you aware of what these people are alleged to be involved in? Surely you can't have any real reason for staying there?\" Why couldn't the woman see the danger she's put herself in? If they ever get the chance to prove what the group has been doing they can raid the garage–arresting everyone inside. Mars didn't want that for the younger woman. He wanted to protect her and make sure she was safe. Angry and annoyed with the detective before her, Essence opens her purse and takes out a few bills, deciding not to wait for the coffee. She slaps them down on the table as she stands up, glaring down at Mars–feeling a bit humiliated that the only reason he asked her to lunch was because he wanted to know about Otto and his friends. She should have known a man out of her league wouldn't have any interest in her. \"Thanks for lunch, I can get my own ride back to the garage.\" she leaned over the table to glare even harshly at Mars, \"And you're a detective, do your own damn work! But I doubt you'll find anything.\" Mars stared wide-eyed at the woman's retreating back, wondering what the hell had just happened. Snapping out of it Mars quickly got up, taking out a few more bills, and ran after the younger woman. Essence shook her head, as she walked out of the restaurant. What an idiot she was! She stopped and closed her eyes, inhaling deeply. Oh, can her life be any more miserable. Tears started to form behind her closed eyelids. Seriously, what the hell was wrong with her? Essence was used to rejection–she shouldn't even have thought that they could have something more from this one lunch date. If you can even call it a date! She exhaled sharply when she felt a hand go down on her shoulder, knowing exactly who it was that was standing behind her. She really didn't want to make a scene, nor did she want to deal with the man at that moment. \"I'm sorry, Essence. Please, let me take you back to the garage.\" Mars pleaded quietly, hating that he had pushed his ambition onto this woman that he had taken an interest in so quickly, especially now that they got to know a bit about each other. \"I promise I'm not going to push you any further about your employers or the garage, okay?\" Opening her eyes–thankfully, now dried–Essence turns to face him, making him drop his hand back to his side. Although she had shut down on him she was slightly opening up again, if reluctantly. Looks like he had a ways to go to regain her trust again. \"Fine,\" she whispered just as quietly. Nodding Mars motioned his car, a 69 Charger that Essence would love to drive. Of course with all that's happened in the last ten minutes or so she couldn't really ask now. They drove in relatively silence back to the garage, Mars glancing at the other woman more often as they got closer. He was getting nervous that Essence might not want to see him again, and he didn't want that to happen. Not that he would, like his ambition to retrieve information what he needs, he will pursue the woman whether she likes it or not. Mars parks next to her Torino, shutting down the Charger and taking off his seatbelt. He sighs quietly and shifts to look at Essence. She was looking towards the open doors of the garage, her hair still covering her face. He went to reach out but Essence looked back towards him, giving him a strain smile. \"Thank you for lunch,\" she told him before quickly getting out. Mars also quickly gets out and moves around his car to take hold Essence's arms. He brings up a hand and moves her hair from her face and neck. Despite the anger he feels Mars looks her over more closely, liking what he was seeing much more. He couldn't help the grin when he sees Essence blush darkly, her distrust for him falling just a bit more. \"How about we try a dinner date, this time?\" he asked, surprising the woman. \"I really do like you, Essence, and I want to keep on seeing you.\" Essence blushed even darker, if that was possible, wondering what she should do. She hasn't told him about Ava–well, actually, she hadn't told anyone about Ava and she was due to come soon, along with her brother. Oh, her brother! How angry he would be if he ever saw the bruises on her face and neck. Hopefully they will leave her skin before he gets there…if the judge ever lets him come with Ava, that is. Smiling shyly, Essence nods. \"Alright, but how about we make it my house? I still don't like to go out with these bruises still visible.\" Mars grins as he stares into her eyes, \"What bruises?\" Shaking her head, Essence gives him her number and does a bold move she's never done before. She quickly went on her tip toes and kissed the man on the cheek, hurrying back inside. Mars smirks as he watches after her, neither of them noticing the dark look Atley held while Chaosia grinned with triumphant. Serves Atley right for taking so damn long in taking Essence out, and now it looks like someone else has beaten him to the punch and he wasn't going to let her go any time soon. At least from what Chaosia could see, the GRAB detective was as smitten with Essence as she was with Atley. Hopefully this doesn't go downhill and blows up in their faces because this could potentially go from bad to worse in less than a second.[Chapter 7] A/N: Sorry, aside from writer's block, I am going back to school and (after getting fired) going back to work. Hope you like the chapter, a bit short, but a little more information on Essence background, as well as the emotions between Essence and Atley. Luka Cacuzza and Paulo belong to Chaosia Guadimus, I hope I did them justice. Please review! :) Healing Hands Chapter 7 Atley was in a soured mood…okay, sour mood was an understatement, he was just a bitter grouchy old man who glowered at everyone and everything. Almost like a child having a tantrum after not getting his way. Everyone kept out of his way, except Sphinx and Ripley since neither of them would take his crap. Of course it was his own fault, he let Essence slip from his fingers and into the GRAB detective's arms! He kept his distance from Essence, not wanting to scare her with his bad mood in the two and a half weeks since she hooked up with the detective–and she couldn't stop smiling. Even the bruises on her face and neck–which were fading now, thank God–didn't even dampened her mood anymore. She wore darker eyeliner as her lashes seemed to look longer, making her eyes stand out more, and now kept her hair pulled back into a ponytail or a braid. The detective almost always came at lunch time to pick Essence up, but apparently the woman noticed how uncomfortable the boosts were of seeing him in their turf and had decided to meet him at wherever they went to eat–much to everyone's relief. The woman was happy, Atley noted, and it only made him angrier at the thought of Essence with the other man. Actually she was more than happy. The one time when it was a very slow day for the garage all the boosts were outside hanging around when the detective–before Essence had him stop coming around–had come for Essence, bringing flowers, which earned him a kiss. Atley was tempted to beat the man but had instead glared at them and went inside to hide up at the private office. Til this day he didn't know why he continued to go to the garage if seeing Essence happy made him angry because it was another man that was doing it. It didn't help any when both Ripley and Sway gushed with Essence over her dates and gave her pointers of making the man want her more. \"If I didn't know any better, you look ready to bash someone's head in.\" Atley grunted in answer, flicking his cigarette away. \"Is everyone here?\" Ripley shook her head, her blonde/purple curls tamed and pulled up for the night. \"We're just waiting on Donnie, Kip, and Toby.\" she told him, looking at all the ships either ready or waiting to leave Long Beach. \"If you wanted you could've had her you know.\" Atley glared at the shorter woman. \"It's none of your business Ripley, stay out of it.\" \"I'm just saying,\" she sing-songed with a grin that rival Sphinx. \"I'm just concern for her getting hurt if that damn detective is only using her to get close to us.\" Atley grumbled, desperately wanting another cigarette. Ripley merely hummed amused at the other man, shaking her head with disbelief. He was in complete denial and was taking it out on the group with his moodiness. Ripley would have pushed Essence to Atley if the other woman didn't like the detective too much and if she didn't get much amusement watching Atley be miserable being around a dating Essence. \"Why do you think you're too old for her?\" Ripley suddenly asked curiously, but she already knew the answer. Hell, it was just like her and Sphinx first started, and the two being best friends meant they had a lot in common. One of them being they didn't want to put the person they were crushing on in danger–though with her and Sphinx it was more or less he was afraid of being committed since he's been alone for a very long time. \"Because I'm an old man!\" Ripley frowned at him with disbelief, \"You're only ten years older than Essence!\" \"A century, really.\" Atley muttered as he thought of Mars being closer to her age. \"Besides I live a dangerous life–we all do. I don't want to jeopardizes or corrupt her innocence if we ever get caught again.\" Ripley snorted, crossing her arms. \"Essence could use a bit of corruption.\" Atley sighed exhausted, Ripley seeing the hard years of being a boost and the middle man in his face. \"You deserve a bit of happiness, Atley, and if Essence was the reason you shouldn't let her go so easily.\" Ripley turned to walk away but stopped and looked over her shoulder. \"You should also pay attention to the way she stares at you. Looks speak a lot louder than words.\" With that said she walked back inside the building, leaving a frowning, and thoughtful, Atley behind. Maybe another cigarette won't kill him. He stopped his hand form reaching back inside his inner pocket when a movement caught his eye. He turned and sighed at the two men walking into the light, wondering why they came out tonight. Though he suspected that the older man wanted to be more involve in his business and with the people doing the job. Still the younger bloods would probably get nervous with him being around. \"Those damn things will kill you a lot faster, my friend.\" the smooth Italian accent was filled with much teasing and knowing, \"Start smoking cigars, you'll live a few years more.\" Atley felt one of his lips going up in amusement. \"Cacuzza, what brings you out of hiding?\" \"It's been over a year since Calitri, it was time to start showing my face again.\" Luka Cacuzza grimaced, his tanned face scrunching up, showing every wrinkle. Despite his age the Italian man looked and acted like a man years younger than what he was, even with the stress this job took on all of them. Maybe it was for the best as many people under estimate him and he proves them wrong–either in smartness or violence, depending on the situation. Sometimes even the man scared Atley with how smart he was. \"And this client is very particular about getting his cars. But tell me, who is this woman that has you stressed out? It cannot be a common whore for you do not look satisfied.\" Atley blushed at how transparent he was but glowered to cover it up. \"There's no woman,\" he told him, his look darkening even more. The two men chuckled as another voice spoke up. Seriously Atley should just kill them all, no one will miss the young blood or the Italian…but his mother would probably kill him, bring him back and kill him again if anything happened to her youngest child. And Cacuzza's body guard will probably bury him out in the desert to let the vultures and ants pick him alive \"Otto hired a new secretary a couple of months ago and Atley's been pining for her ever since. Only now she's dating one of the GRAB detectives.\" Kip tells them with a mischievous grin. Cacuzza frowned, \"Does she–?\" \"No, and she's asked the detective not to come around either because of how uncomfortable it was for us to have him around.\" Kip confirmed, but gave a pointed look at Atley. Before the conversion can come back to him, Atley spoke up. \"Did the others finally get here?\" Kip grinned at the other man who was like an uncle. \"Yeah they did.\" \"All right, let's get this done tonight.\" Kip and Cacuzza grinned at each other before walking after Atley. The Italian, however, slowed down and looked to his bodyguard and trusted friend, Paulo. Not that he didn't trust Memphis, Atley, or even Otto's judgment, he just couldn't be too careful about who all work in this garage where his business is worked out of most of the time. \"Find out what you can about this woman, make sure she's a friend.\" he whispered so the younger Rains doesn't hear. \"I'm sure Ripley will supply you with the name.\" Essence was in a good mood, despite not having more than three hours of sleep. Even though it was supposed to be her day off because she had just worked the night shift at the hospital, Chaosia sounded horrible on the phone. She felt bad for the other woman–though was grateful that even sick she sounded like Essence would if she ever got sick. Besides, it's not like she can't use the extra money. She sighed with content, grinning like a mad woman. Troy had called her that morning to let her know that, with the judge's permission, he was coming down with Ana for a weekend visit. The judge even warned her ex that if he didn't follow the rules again then he was to pay with the consequences–despite the court favoring him and the evidence. Essence hoped the asshole misses up again, but she knew that it was wishful thinking. Tomorrow her brother would be in California, taking the corporate jet as it would be faster, but he never said what time. Essence was excited to see her brother and Ana, too long has it been since she last seen them. She prayed that Otto wouldn't have any mind asking off at last minute, if needed she will tell them the truth about the secret she's kept hidden. Not that she didn't trust them anymore–because she does– but Essence never felt like it was the right time for her to let Otto and the others know about Ana. Until now. With a sigh and a mental shake of her head Essence parked in her usual spot next to the Shelby and quickly got out, a few minutes late. However when it seemed that there was nothing to dampen her mood the scene before her takes her aback by surprise. She inhaled sharply, her heart breaking just a bit–though Essence couldn't think of why it would when it was only friendship, nothing more, that she felt for this person. A few cars down were Atley and a voluptuous woman kissing. Holding back tears–which she didn't know why she was even tearing up for a man she barely knew–Essence walked away, placing the alarm upon her car. She ignored the couple–who no doubt heard her alarm beeping–quickly walking towards the entrance. Her heart was beating fast, nodding tiredly to Kip, Donnie, and Sway as she walked towards the stairs for the offices. They all frowned when they saw her, but Essence ignored the looks, just wanting to be alone and do her work in peace and try to get her bearings again. She was dating Mars, he made her feel things that she hasn't felt in a very long time…just like Atley when he was being nice to her and not really in his own world. Essence sighed. Who was she kidding? Atley made her feel completely different then what Mars has made her feel. Why was her life so complicated when it came to feelings and men? All she wanted at the moment was her big brother and her treasure. They were the only ones who can ease this pain, this confusion, and simply make her feel like herself. She grinned just the slightest as she entered the office, Angel too, of course. She couldn't forget her crazy ass dog that seemed to like to act like a human more than an animal. Putting her purse on the floor Essence quickly boot up the dinosaurs and went around opening the blinds and windows, letting in the fresh air and the sun inside. When she turned back she smiled at Toby, Kip, and Tumbler walking in. She smiled at them gratefully. She knew that they knew she needed a pick-me-up–Essence was never good at keeping her emotions from them–and was all too glad that they came. Atley angrily pushed away from the woman he had a one-night stand nearly a few months ago and looked over to his left. He felt his heart beat quicken at the sight of Essence quickly walking inside the garage, but not before looking back at him with both surprise and sadness before quickly walking away. An angry scowl descended upon his face and turned to the woman before him, holding her at arm length. The woman pouted her red lips, giving him a seductive look in hopes of pursuing him. Glaring at her lips, Atley mentally reminded himself to scrub off the make-up from his own before going to find Essence. \"This was a one-night stand, Shirley ; it means you forget the person you slept with and go on as though nothing happened.\" he growled angrily. \"You need to stop calling me and coming around where I work!\" Shirley merely pouted even more, pushing her C-cup breasts towards him, trying to get closer as she trailed a manicured finger down his chest. \"But we were so good together; I thought one more night would be all right.\" Atley merely growled, glaring at the woman and pushing her even further away. \" No ! Leave me alone and don't you ever come near this place again. I mean it!\" With that said, he turned and walked as quickly as he could towards the garage, trying to figure out how he can convince Essence that what she saw was truly nothing. Then again, why did he have to explain anything to her? They were only friends–if that–nothing more. What he did outside of the garage and in his life was just that, his life . Just like what she did was just her own thing. Of course, he would like to make the GRAB detective take a hike and keep away from Essence so long as she worked at the garage. That, however, was more for her protection, nothing more. Nodding to Memphis and Sway–both whom raised a curious eyebrow at him–moved towards the stairs with as much quickness as his leg would let him. He entered the office to see the woman sitting on her desk and laughing with Kip, Tumbler, and Toby. Once again the young tech was leaning against Essence, only this time his arm was wrapped around her waist, keeping her close. Atley almost lost it. He had to calm down and remind himself that they were only friends, nothing more, and Essence was dating that GRAB detective, she wasn't that kind of woman. Not wanting to interrupt them Atley continued on to the private office, maybe getting more information on the cars they were to steal in the next couple of days will help ease his mind off the jealousy he knew he was feeling at seeing Toby and Essence. Then again nothing will satisfy him more than to see Essence free of any male presences, but knew that it wasn't going to happen any time soon. But his conscious tells him, not for the last time it seems, that he had no say in her life. Essence wasn't his, not that she was a piece of property to be had , but it still stands with him not saying what she should do or not in her life. Paulo closed the door to the office that held shelves full of books and vintage paintings that cost more than most of the cars that are stolen. Cacuzza looked away from the windows, nodding to him as he neared the desk. Many years the two have known each other, despite the age difference they were great friends. It was Paulo's uncle who had introduced him to Cacuzza when he was a teenager, days only before he died. The reason was because Paulo's parents had died when he was a child and his uncle was the last of his relatives. With nowhere to go Cacuzza promised his uncle to take care of him. The older man didn't want to bring Paulo into the organization but he had intervened when one of Cacuzza's most trusted men were about turn on him. Cacuzza was grateful and had asked him what it was that he wanted in return. Paulo didn't hesitate when he told him he wanted to work in his organization. He knew the older man had promised his uncle to take care of him and to lead him on the right path, but Paulo wanted to make his own choices. From what he's seen and heard around Cacuzza he wanted in, and now was his chance. Granted Cacuzza had him as a runner because he was a teenager, but once he hit eighteen he was his bodyguard and right hand man. Especially after bringing down several rats. \"What did you find about Atley's mysterious woman?\" Cacuzza asked with a grin \"Essence Morgan, twenty-three, single, and also works third shift at St. Catherine. She moved out here about a month ago, the only family member she has is an older brother, Troy Morgan. He's thirty-eight, also single, and works as a high end attorney for a multibillion dollar conglomerate. Their parents did when she was fifteen in a car accident a few hours north of here, which she then had to live with her brother in Chicago. They both have clean records–minus Miss Morgan's speeding tickets as a teenager. From what Ripley has told me about the woman she is a shy little thing that doesn't go noising around other people's business and respects the other's privacy.\" Cacuzza raises an eyebrow at Paulo when he hesitated. Usually when he did this it meant that he had assessed the situation at hand but didn't know how to go about the situation. Doesn't mean that it was something horrible, but it wasn't good either. The Italian wondered if the situation had anything to do with them and their operation. \"What is it Paulo? What else did you find about this woman?\" Paulo frowned, continuing to think over the information but sighed quietly. \"There is one thing about Miss Morgan's past. She is linked to a criminal who doesn't get his hands dirty…\" Cacuzza raises an eyebrow, \" And ?\" \"She bore him a child that he took from her. Her brother had tried to fight it, but the court found her to be an unfit mother and gave sole custody to the father. But it didn't look right so I asked a friend out there to see if he can send me the court transactions and find out more information on this guy.\" Cacuzza frowns, leaning forward on his desk, his lips pressed against his fists. From what Paulo has said it didn't sound right to him either. Something told him that the situation this woman was in was not right and if they can find something to help this woman get her daughter then they will do whatever they can. And maybe help her see the connection she and Atley could possibly have?[Chapter 8] Healing Hands Chapter 8 \"So you were a geek!\" Mars laughed. He was looking down at a framed picture of her as a teenager and her brother, Troy, at Comic Con in Chicago. She was wearing a long, multi-colored scarf, a Panama hat with a red band and glittering silver sequins, a silver pocket watch hanging from around her neck with some writing on it, and holding up a pen that was silver with black and yellow stripes and a red trim. Her brother wore simple jeans, a blue shirt underneath a black leather jacket, and looking very out of place next to Essence and the people in costumes in the back ground. He was smiling, as was Essence, his arm around her shoulders and looking relaxed. It was one of her rare nights off from the hospital and Mars couldn't get off fast enough. For the past couple of weeks he's been coming over to her place–having a bigger kitchen and all–and would take turns cooking whatever it was they were in the mood for. He liked it. It felt…right, in some ways, better than him going home to an empty apartment that is. Then Castlebeck found out about the relationship and ripped him a new one. Mars had to quickly explain that he had pursued Essence in order to find out information about Memphis and his gang, but had come to like the woman. In the end Castlebeck relented when he saw the truth in his words and let the relationship keep going. However, should Mars have found anything on the woman being in league with Memphis and his men, then he had to cut it off and arrest her. But Mars was certain that Essence had nothing to do with Memphis or boosting, it just wasn't Essence! Looks can be deceiving, he knew, but the woman was different from all the others–both criminals and those he had dated in the past. Mars knew he had nothing to worry about with her nor their relationship ending. \"So what if I was!\" Essence defended with a blush, walking back from the kitchen with two beers in hand. \"My brother's secretary–gorgeous supermodel looks–was the one who introduced me to Doctor Who and my brother did everything he could to find me each of those items for either my birthday or Christmas gift. When he surprised me to go to Comic Con I put every piece of Doctor Who item I owned.\" Mars chuckles, putting the frame on the glass table in front of him and wrapped an arm around Essence's waist, bringing her down on to his lap. He took one of the beer bottles from her, kissing her lips on the process, before settling back against the arm rest of the couch. Angel was sleeping near the back door, the last bit of sunlight pouring through and warming him before the sun lowered over the other houses and privacy fence completely. He had enough excitement earlier with Mars and Essence throwing a ball or a toy of his to catch and then chased after him when he didn't want to give it back to them, out in the backyard after dinner. Essence settles comfortably against Mars, staring at the picture with a smile at the fond memories of that day, drinking some of her beer. To this day Troy still cursed Anne for having told her about the British television show, seeing how obsessed she was to know even the smallest details that any geek of any show would know about. That picture was taken a year after her parents had died and three months after meeting her ex. Essence suddenly realized that that day was the first time that she had truly smiled. Though Troy hated that his baby sister had become a geek, he couldn't fault her for it as it had finally made her happy and become her old self again. And Essence loved him all the more for it. She still had the items, stored in the third bedroom she had converted into an office of sorts. She had more Doctor Who items on the tall bookshelf behind the desk, along with a few rare DC comics. Although she did love the Marvel universe, DC will always be her favorite no matter what. Mars' lips on her cheek and moving down to her jaw and neck brought her out of her thoughts. Though she only became distracted by what she was feeling from his lips. Although they've been dating for a good while now, Essence was still shy and uncertain when it comes to sex because of how her first time had went. \"What are you thinking?\" he muttered against her skin. Essence smiled, tilting her head to the side as she closed her eyes. \"About my brother and how he's going to visit for the weekend.\" \"He's not going to interrogate me, then bury me somewhere no one's ever going to find me, is he?\" Mars questioned teasingly, \"After all, I am a cop.\" Essence chuckles, raising the beer to her lips. \"Maybe, you'll just have to wait and find out I guess.\" Though, she hoped that it won't be this weekend as her brother isn't coming alone. As much as she liked Mars, she wasn't ready to introduce him to the one person who means the world to her or even ready herself to introduce them to anyone just yet. Besides, the relationship had just barely started and was severely new, wasn't there some kind of rule about introducing family members so early? Then there was the deal with her bruises. Luckily, the hand prints around her neck had all disappeared, however there was still some fading across her cheek and near the corner of her eye. Essence was just grateful that she was able to cover it completely with make-up. Mars chuckles at her responds, pulling back to look at her, smiling. \"Aren't you afraid of not seeing me again? Am I really that replaceable?\" \"Yes, yes you are.\" Essence told him with a straight face, placing her beer on the side table. Mars' look was priceless and Essence couldn't help but laugh. Mars growls and moves so that he was above her and begins to tickle her sides. Essence squeals before laughing, wiggling around, trying her hardest to escape from his fingers. However, his body prevented her from it, not that she really minded as she liked how his weight felt on top of her. Mars suddenly took hold of her wrists, holding her arms above her head, smiling down at the woman he wanted to get close to in order to get to Rains and his men. But had fallen for her instead, and all he wanted to do was to keep her safe and make sure that she doesn't get hurt from either him doing his job or those at the garage that steal cars. Essence breathlessly smiled up at Mars, waiting for him to make the first move. He leaned down and kissed her softly, Essence sighing with content. Mars had two sides to him when it came to her, rough and gentle. And if Essence was honest to herself, she actually liked both sides–despite her rough past. However, she knew that Mars always took the gentleness with her, no doubt having seen how skittish she becomes whenever the kissing and the touching start to become more and Essence start to freak out. She never spoke about her past, or the reason that had made her so skittish, but Mars seemed to get the gist of it–being a cop and all, he has seen similar symptoms from different situations–and would always back out quickly. That was one of the many things that Essence liked Mars about. Despite his needs, he always made sure that hers were first and whether she was comfortable. The mood suddenly came to a halt as her phone started to ring and vibrate. Mars groaned, placing his forehead against her shoulder, Essence reaching into her pocket, biting her lower lip as she felt Mars starting to get hard through his jeans. She glanced at the screen and sighed, quickly swiping her finger across it and bringing it to her ear, kissing Mars' head as an apology. He understood how brothers were, hell it was like that with his older brother before they had parted ways a few years back after the death of their father. Mars' thoughts slowly went to his own brother, wondering how he was doing as he hasn't seen or heard any new information on him in a while. \"Hi Troy, I was just thinking about you.\" \" Nothing too bad, I hope?\" Essence smirked at the sarcasm behind his voice. \"All right, I know you didn't call me to yell and scold me. What's up?\" when he sighed and stayed silent, Essence became worried, slightly pushing at Mars so she can sit up, frowning with concern. \"Troy, what's happened?\" Mars frowned as he sat up with her, rubbing her shoulders and back with concern. He wanted to ask what was going on, but kept his mouth shut for he didn't want Essence's brother to maneuver the question towards Essence. He felt her grip his other hand tightly, the fear of something has happened radiating off of her in waves. \" I just wanted to let you know that something came up with a client and I have to take care of it before leaving Chicago. So both me and Ava won't get to LAX until the afternoon instead of early morning as planned.\" Essence growled at the back of her throat, letting Mars' hand go and shoving it through her hair angrily. \"Damn you Troy! You can't just go and scare the shit out of me like that!\" she yelled, quickly swinging her feet and shoving to a stand, pacing around the living room. \" Sorry sweetheart, I'm at work and trying to figure something out.\" Essence took a deep breath, slowly calming down. \"I get you have to work, it's not a big deal. I'll just work a half day at the garage and then pick you up at the airport.\" \" No, I'll get a car, don't worry. You know how planes are, we can be delayed or arrive earlier than expected–even with the company jet. Don't worry, I'll meet you at your house.\" Essence calmed herself down–though she really wanted to strangle her brother to death through the phone–and sat back down on the couch, leaning back against Mars, who wrapped his arms around her. \"Okay, fine. I'll text you, let's say, noon? To let you know where I'm at, that way I can get off early or something.\" \" Okay, I'll do that.\" he sighed, Essence missing her big brother even more. \"Love you, stay safe Elixir.\" \"Love you too, big brother. Bye.\" she whispered quietly, the both of them hanging up. She groaned in frustration, letting her head fall back against Mars' shoulder. She smiled when she felt his lips on her cheek, hugging her closer to him. Essence has told him of how frustrating her brother could be at times and, having witness her one-sided conversation, probably did not doubt the craziness she spoke of before. However, she felt Mars chuckling against her neck as he was kissing her skin. \"It's not funny, sometimes my brother doesn't realize that what he says, or doesn't say, can scare the crap out of a person! Mostly, me !\" Essence tells him, though she was smiling. Mars continued to smile, placing his chin on her shoulder. \"At least you'll be seeing him tomorrow after a couple of months of moving out here.\" Essence sighs her agreement, her thoughts going to her brother. If it wasn't for Troy pushing her to live, to move on with her life, she wouldn't be there in California, living a fearless life…a free life. She owed her brother for much more than a simple thanks, even if he was stubborn to see it that way. Even to this day Troy continued to take care of her, protecting her, whether she wanted it or not. Essence just wished that she could do something in return for him. Mars suddenly kissed her cheek, moving around so that he was now standing. \"I better get going, I have to go in early tomorrow morning. I'll call you some time tomorrow?\" he questioned unsure, taking hold of his jacket from the arm chair of the other couch that he threw over earlier. Essence smiled, standing and wrapping her arms around his waist. \"Maybe, depends what my brother wants to do tomorrow.\" Mars hums, wrapping his own arms around her. \"Hopefully your brother would want to meet the man who's dating his sister.\" Essence hummed back in return, pursing her lips together as though she were thinking about it–though she really was considering of Mars not meeting her brother just yet. Mars laughs and kissed her, Essence laughing into the kiss. She squealed when he suddenly picked her up, the woman relishing in the strength of his arms. Since they have started dating Essence couldn't help every opportunity moment to stay in his arms just a tad longer. And Mars knew it, so he complies to her moments, not saying a word that he knew. Besides, Mars liked having her in his arms too. \"Troy would rather just intimidate you until you decide to leave me be.\" Essence answers him as soon as Mars puts her back down on the ground. Mars grins, raising an eyebrow as he wraps an arm around her shoulders as they walked towards the door. \"Sweetheart, I doubt your brother can intimidate me, let alone make me leave you be.\" \"We'll see,\" Essence sings teasingly as she opens the door. Mars laughs, stepping out the door but turning back to face Essence, holding her hips. His fingers rose under her shirt, caressing her skin. \"I see you have little faith in me.\" Essence makes a face at but was smiling nonetheless. \"Drive safe.\" she whispered, going on her tiptoes and kissing him one last time before pushing him away. \"Sweet dreams, sweetheart.\" Mars called back, looking over his shoulder before getting into his car. Essence closed and locked the door, turning to lean back against it. Angel was waiting for her, sitting down next to the couch, watching her intently. She didn't want to tell Mars, not yet at least, about who else was coming, of who they meant to her, and why she had kept it a secret. But she couldn't keep her a secret for too long, especially with her brother finally coming to visit. Essence couldn't help have a feeling that Mars was going to find out tomorrow, but he wouldn't just show up unannounced, right? \"Oh Angel,\" the German Shepard got up to all fours, wagging his tail. \"What should I do?\" A/N: Sorry for the long wait! Writing a story that I can take in many directions and not knowing which way to go is a pain!

Oficjalnie zatrudniono ją jako mechanika, ale ponieważ była najsympatyczniejsza z załogi powierzono jej również rekrutację pasażerów. Pogodne usposobienie i rude włosy nadawały jej wygląd osoby młodszej niż w rzeczywistości. To jej uroczy, dziecięcy uśmiech zjednywał im większość klientów. Teraz jednak się nie uśmiechała, starając się jak najszybciej pozbyć intruza. -Mnie zabierzecie -przybysz wyszczerzył się bezczelnie, prezentując pożółkłe od nikotyny zęby - Mam pilną przesyłkę rządową, a wy lecicie na Laudos. -Mamy już towar-spróbowała wykręcić się dziewczyna, ale facet nie dawał się spławić. -Zmieścimy się. Chyba, że nie chcecie mnie zabrać? -Musi pan rozmawiać z kapitanem -zrezygnowana Kaylee już wyobrażała sobie wkurzoną minę Mal'a. Kapitan nienawidził rządowych kurierów. Nie, nie kurierów. On nienawidził rządu -westchnęła w duchu mierząc faceta taksującym spojrzeniem. Zwalisty około 50-ki -oceniła - Ubranie już dawno nie widziało wody, podobnie jak twarz i ręce. Był nieogolony, a w kąciku ust zwisał mu niedopałek czegoś, co w dawnych czasach było zapewnie kawałkiem cygara. Mężczyzna uśmiechał się nieszczerze, nieprzyjemnie błądząc wzrokiem po jej ciele. -Jakiś problem? -zabrzmiało tuż za nimi i oboje gwałtownie się obrócili. Malcolm Reynolds, kapitan statku był dość przystojnym mężczyzną, jednak jego ponury wyraz twarzy skutecznie zniechęcał do niego ludzi. Coś twardego i nieugiętego w jego zachowaniu oraz zaciśnięte usta i zimny wzrok były jego nieodzownymi atrybutami od czasów ostatniej wojny domowej. Rzadko się uśmiechał. Długi brązowy płaszcz, wysokie skórzane buty i pas z bronią nonszalancko zsunięty na biodrze, nadawały mu wygląd typowy dla kosmicznych kowbojów i przemytników. Mężczyźni przez chwilę mierzyli się wzrokiem. Mal po jednym spojrzeniu wiedział z kim ma do czynienia. \"Łowca Głów, bezwzględny i okrutny zabójca\" -ocenił przybysza w myślach. Tropiciele często byli o wiele gorsi od ludzi, których ścigali. Mimo, że Sojusz płacił więcej za żywych zbiegów, z nieznanych przyczyn większość z nich docierała w kilku kawałkach. Bycie Łowcą stanowiło idealne zajęcie dla kogoś o skłonnościach sadystycznych lub psychopaty. Rządu to nie obchodziło, nie zależało im na życiu większości uciekinierów. Jeśli faktycznie chcieli kogoś dostać żywcem, widać to było po cenie. Wartość takiego zbiega, stanowiła zwykle czterokrotną wartość trupa. - To jest pan Cage -Kaylee niechętnie wskazała przybysza. - Jak już mówiłem Reynolds -przerwał jej Łowca - Mam pilną przesyłkę rządową i lecę z wami na Laudos - oświadczył twardo i spojrzał wyzywająco na kapitana. Ku rozczarowaniu dziewczyny Malcolm tylko uśmiechnął się krzywo. -Jeśli masz czym zapłacić to się pakuj. Startujemy za 15 minut. -odpowiedział swobodnym tonem. Dziewczyna nie mogła uwierzyć własnym uszom. Kapitan nie tylko się zgodził, ale najwyraźniej nie widział w tym żadnego problemu. Pobiegła za nim, gdy tylko pasażer ruszył po bagaż. -Jak pan mógł się zgodzić? -oburzona dopadła mężczyznę przy schodach do sterowni -Przecież to Łowca, a my mamy dwójkę zbiegów na pokładzie! Reynolds spojrzał na nią tak, że zaraz pożałowała swojego wybuchu. Mal nie uznawał żadnej niesubordynacji, więc pod jego twardym spojrzeniem spuściła z tonu i zaczęła się tłumaczyć. -Nie mówię panu co ma pan robić, kaptanie. Ale to niebezpieczna sytuacja i ja tylko... -Mam nadzieję Kaylee, że mi nie mówisz. -przerwał bezceremonialnie, rzucając jej ostrzegawcze spojrzenie. -Słyszałaś co powiedział? -Tak, ale... -oponowała dziewczyna, nie bardzo rozumiejąc do czego zmierza ta rozmowa. -Więc posłuchaj -powiedział zimno -Facet ma \"pilną\" rządową przesyłkę, a to oznacza bardzo ważnego zbiega. Zwrócił się do mnie po nazwisku, co z kolei oznacza, że nie trafił tu przypadkiem. On dobrze wie kim jesteśmy i czym się zajmujemy. Naprawdę chcesz, żebym mu się postawił, bo on najwyraźniej o tym marzy? -zapytał retorycznie. Kaylee pokręciła przecząco głową. Malcolm ma rację. Wszyscy kapitanowie byli zobowiązani pomagać \"urzędnikom rządowym\". Nie było to oficjalne rozporządzenie, ale nikt kto miał choćby odrobinę oleju w głowie nie próbował sprawdzać co się stanie jeśli odmówi. \"Tylko, że inni kapitanowie nie mieli na pokładzie dwóch zbiegów, za którymi uganiało się pół galaktyki\" -pomyślała kwaśno. -I nie, nie zamierzam odlecieć bez niego -kapitan zdawał się czytać w jej myślach, bo pomysł ucieczki właśnie zaświtał jej w głowie -Nie potrzebujemy nowych wrogów. Dość mamy tych starych. -Idź do Simona -zakomenderował wchodząc na schody. Nie musiał nic więcej dodawać. Siostra lekarza musiała zniknąć na jeden dzień. Simon, jeśli chciał mógł zostać, decyzja należała do niego. Jednak oboje byli poszukiwani. Mal przyjął ich na statek tylko dlatego, że chłopak był świetnym lekarzem. Reszta załogi podejrzewała, że nie był to jedyny powód. Choć Reynolds osobiście nie lubił lekarza to z River sprawa była trudniejsza. Dziewczyna była genialnym dzieckiem, które trafiło do prestiżowej rządowej szkoły. Wszystko było dobrze dopóki Sojusz nie postanowił odkryć źródła jej geniuszu. Dziewczyna stała się królikiem doświadczalnym. Liczne eksperymenty, którym ją poddawano uszkodziły nie tylko jej mózg, ale i psychikę. Simon, żeby ją ratować porzucił rodzinę, karierę genialnego chirurga, pieniądze i dobre imię. Poświęcił wszystko by odzyskać siostrę i faktycznie mu się to udało. Jednak koszt był większy niż założył. Sojusz nie zamierzał odpuścić. Zostali najbardziej poszukiwanymi zbiegami w galaktyce. Pieniądze szybko się skończyły, a rodzina nie chciała mieć z nimi nic wspólnego. Nie przetrwaliby długo gdyby nie pomoc kogoś lepiej obznajmionego ze światem. Załoga podejrzewała, że być może Mal w jakiś dziwny i pokręcony sposób, czuł się za nich odpowiedzialny. Zanim łowca wrócił na statek wszyscy zostali poinstruowani jak mają się zachowywać. Nikt z załogi nie był zachwycony nowym pasażerem, ale jak zwykle w przypadku kapitana, gdy podjął jakąś decyzję, pozostali nie mieli nic do powiedzenia. Simon postanowił się nie ujawniać. Obawiał się, że zamknięcie River samej w kajucie tylko pogorszy jej stan. Wolał nie ryzykować. W końcu podroż miała zająć tylko jeden dzień.[Chapter 2] Rozdział 2: Niespodzianka -To tylko jeden dzień -powiedział pojednawczo Malcolm, obserwując skwaszone miny swojej załogi. Zgromadzili się na mostku, żeby omówić sytuację i upewnić się czy wszyscy wiedzą jak mają się zachowywać. Wśród zebranych nie było tylko Simona, który poszedł zabrać kilka rzeczy z ambulatorium i trochę żywności. Planował zamknąć się z siostrą w kajucie i zablokować drzwi od środka. Kiedy usłyszał o Łowcy na pokładzie był wściekły na Reynoldsa. W duchu jednak przyznawał mu rację, choć ten nigdy nie miał się o tym dowiedzieć. Simon nie był głupi. Znał zasady i wiedział że nie można było odmówić. Jego stosunki z kapitanem były dość skomplikowane. Obaj permanentnie byli na siebie wkurzeni. Reynolds przyzwyczajony do bezwzględnego posłuszeństwa, nie akceptował niesubordynacji lekarza, a Simon nie mógł przetrawić apodyktycznego zachowania kapitana. Czuł, że Malcolm mógłby go zabić i pewnie chętnie by to zrobił, gdyby ten nie był mu potrzebny. Mimo to uważał, że ma przewagę. Może i jest słabszy i nie zna życia na pograniczu, ale z pewnością jest inteligentniejszy. Geniusz, był w jego rodzinie dziedziczny. Cenna przesyłka okazałą sie sporym zaskoczeniem dla załogi. Niezbyt wysoki chłopak bez zarostu, musiał być jeszcze bardzo młody. Trudno to było dokładnie ocenić przez opuchliznę i ślady krwi obejmującą prawie połowę jego twarzy. Skute ręce zwisały bezwładnie, a pochylona głowa i spuszczone oczy sprawiały, że wyglądał jeszcze mniej groźnie. Kiedy Cage ciągnąc go za ramię, wmaszerował na statek, załoga obserwowała ich ze zdziwieniem. Spodziewali się jakiego dryblasa, a nie chucherka wielkości dziewczyny. Na wzmiankę o kajucie dla więźnia, Łowca tylko wzruszył ramionami i przypiął chłopaka do balustrady w ładowni. Odkąd weszli na pokład młody nie podniósł głowy. Ubrany w brudne spodnie i wyciągniętą bluzę, ramiona okrył czarnym płaszczem przeciwdeszczowym. Szara czapka na głowie ukrywała krótkie, postrzępione włosy w tym samym mysim kolorze. Mimo dość poważnych obrażeń chłopak nie sprawiał wrażenia przestraszonego. Nie odzywał się, tylko od czasu do czasu rzucał ukradkowe spojrzenia jakby oceniając sytuację. Cage dość brutalnie usadził więźnia na ziemi i zakazał zbliżać się do niego. Potem ruszył do wskazanej mu kajuty. -To zwykły śmieć -Łowca pogardliwie wygiął usta, pociągając kolejny łyk z butelki. Naczynie było już prawie puste, a mężczyzna zaczynał bełkotać. Załoga rzucała mu pełne niechęci spojrzenia, choć zgodnie z zaleceniem kapitana, nikt się nie odzywał. Malcolm również ignorował pasażera, pałaszując proteinową papkę, jakby była daniem z najlepszej restauracji. Cage odstawił butelkę i właśnie wgryzał się w kawałek mięsa wyjęty z torby podróżnej. Widać obiad zaserwowany na statku nie spełnił jego oczekiwań, bo odsunął talerz z niechęcią i wyją własny zapas jedzenia. Załoga mogła sobie pozwolić na lepszy posiłek -byli świeżo zaprowiantowani, ale woleli poczekać, aż intruz opuści ich statek. Zapas świeżych warzyw i worek jabłek, które zdobyli z takim trudem miały im wystarczyć na przynajmniej tydzień. Nie było więc mowy, żeby podzielili się nim z kimś takim jak Łowca. Przez ostatnie 20 minut mężczyzna praktycznie mówił sam do siebie i wcale mu to nie przeszkadzało. Opowiadał jakim to jest świetnym tropicielm, i że nikt na kogo zagiął parol mu nie umknie. Choć ostatnia uwaga zabrzmiała niemal jak groźba, przy stole nadal panowała cisza. Nie znalazłszy godnego słuchaczy Cage kontynuował swoja opowieść do wyimaginowanego audytorium. Chwalił się pieniędzmi, które dostawał za schwytanych i szczycił swoją brutalnością wobec nich. Pasterz Book, będący gościem na statku już dawno stracił apetyt. Przybywanie w pobliżu tego troglodyty nie należało do przyjemności. Wcześniej widział więźnia i teraz zastanawiał się, czy chłopak miał chociaż wolne ręce kiedy Cage go masakrował. Niestety nie mógł o to zapytać, więc ograniczał się do obrzucania intruza pełnymi dezaprobaty spojrzeniami. Kaylee też straciła apetyt. Kiedy jeszcze pasażer zaczął szczegółowo opisywać jak wypatroszył jednego uciekiniera, w ogóle przestała jeść za to zaczęła planować swoją ucieczkę do kajuty. Jedyną zainteresowaną osobą wydawał się Jane. Cobb marzył kiedyś o karierze łowcy, niestety trzeba było mieć do tego własny statek, na który nie było go stać. Z braku innych możliwości został więc najemnikiem. Zoe, była podwładna Malcolma w wojsku, a obecnie pierwszy oficer i żona pilota Hobana Washburne'a, była równie twarda jak kapitan. W tej chwili z kamienną twarzą kończyła posiłek. Takie historie i ludzie pokroju Łowcy nie robili na niej wrażenia. Cage poinformowała ich, że jego statek uległ uszkodzeniu, a on sam nie zamierza czekać na naprawę. Zbyt wielu Łowców ostrzyło sobie zęby na jego zdobycz. Podkradanie uciekinierów nie było niczym szczególnym w tym zawodzie. Jeśli tylko stawka była odpowiednio wysoka, niejeden Łowca stracił coś więcej niż tylko więźnia. \"Kompletny idiota\" - oceniła go w myślach ciemnoskóra Zoe. Z taką swobodą opowiadał o swoim cennym ładunku, będąc na środku niczego z niechętnymi mu ludźmi, że była wręcz zdumiona. Nawet Cobb by czegoś takiego nie zrobił. Wystarczyłoby, zastrzelić tropiciela i jego ciało wyrzucić w kosmos. Potem spokojnie sami mogli dostarczyć przesyłkę i zagarnąć nagrodę. Jane najwyraźniej rozważał ten pomysł, bo na jego twarzy pojawił się rzadki widok, wyraz głębokiej zadumy. -Padła cała kolonia - pasażer zdawał się nie dostrzegać otaczającej go niechęci i rokoszując się dźwiękiem własnego głosu, opowiadał dalej -Gdyby mi nie powiedzieli, sam nigdy bym w to nie uwierzył -Jednym haustem opróżnił butelkę do czysta i z pewnym żalem zaczął wpatrywać się w jej puste dno. -Jak to zrobił? - wyrwało się Jeanowi, za co zarobił groźne spojrzenie od kapitana. -Wirus -oznajmił triumfalnie mężczyzna i z dumą powiódł szklistym wzrokiem po zaskoczonych współbiesiadnikach. Ukontentowany wrażeniem jakie udało mu się osiągnąć, kontynuował -Odciął im dopływ tlenu. Wszyscy się udusili, co do jednego -zakończył dramatycznie -To by znaczyło, że planeta nie była uzdatniona. Skąd więc koloniści? -tym razem głos zabrał pasterz Book. -Nie wiem i niezbyt mnie to obchodzi -wzruszył ramionami Łowca -Dla mnie liczy się tylko nagroda. -Wygląda bardzo młodo -stwierdziła cicho Kaylee jakby mówiła do siebie. -Jak chcesz to mogę go zapytać -zarechotał nieprzyjemnie Cage puszczając do niej oko. Kiedy wstawał, krzesło z hukiem uderzyło o podłogę, ale mężczyzna wcale się tym nie przejął, tylko chwiejnym krokiem ruszył w stronę drzwi. -Co za obleśny...-tylko obecność pasterza powstrzymała dziewczynę od dokończenia zdania. Chwilę później doszedł ich zduszony krzyk poprzedzony gniewnym, bełkotliwym rozkazem. Z powodu odległości nie zrozumieli czego ten rozkaz dotyczył. Wiedzieli tylko, że krzyk nie należał do Łowcy i towarzyszyło mu głuche uderzenie, jakby ktoś upadł. Załoga jak na komendę spojrzała na kapitana, który znieruchomiał na sekundę. -Zamierza pan coś z tym zrobić, sir? - zapytała spokojnie Zoe. Reynolds odłożył trzymany w ręku widelec i zapatrzył się przed siebie. Krzyki dochodzące z ładowni zaczęły się nasilać. Bez słowa nałożył na talerz proteinowej breji, zabrał łyżkę i wyszedł.[Chapter 3] Malcolm stanął w drzwiach ładowni i przyglądał się scenie przy barierce. Chłopak leżał na boku i desperacko próbował osłonić brzuch. Nie było to łatwe, zwłaszcza że na rękach miał kajdanki. Napastnik był od niego dwa razy większy i najwyraźniej dobrze się bawił. Wielki facet tłukący skutego więźnia to odrażający widok. Gówniarz nie miał szans. -Mal chętnie by splunął, żeby pozbyć się niesmaku w ustach. -Widzę, że nie zależy ci na nagrodzie, Cage -zagadnął beznamiętnie wpatrując się w Łowcę. Mężczyzna znieruchomiał i odwrócił się. Jego poczerwieniała od alkoholu i wysiłku twarz przybrała wściekły wyraz. Chłopak również znieruchomiał. Stracił przytomność, lub tyko udawał by zniechęcić napastnika. -Czego chcesz Reynolds? -wybełkotał łowca. -Niczego -odpowiedział kapitan i powoli podszedł do więźnia - Po prostu widzę, że zamierzasz go zabić -schylił się by sprawdzić puls - I prawie ci się udało -pokiwał głową z udawanym uznaniem. Chłopak był przytomny, ale rozsądnie wolał pozostać nieruchomy. Mal wyczuł, że pod jego dotykiem ciało zesztywniało. Widocznie uwaga kapitana przedarła się do zamglonego oparami alkoholu mózgu Cage'a, bo wyglądał na zaniepokojonego. Spojrzał posępnie na więźnia. Nagroda była zbyt duża, by stracić ja z powodu pijackiego szału. -Przecież żyje -stwierdził sucho. Kapitan tylko wzruszył ramionami i nie oglądając się za siebie, ruszył do swojej kabiny. Łowca przez chwilę stał patrząc na leżącego chłopaka. Jedno oko miał mocno opuchnięte, a większość twarzy przybrała kolor dojrzałej śliwki. Z nosa sączyła się krew. Kiedy kopnął go pogardliwie nogą z krtani pobitego wydobył się zduszony jęk. Cage przez chwilę wpatrywał się w ciało na ziemi, potem mruknął coś pod nosem i odszedł. Kilka minut później chłopak ostrożnie otworzył oczy i podciągnął się do pozycji siedzącej. Z jękiem bólu oparł się o ścianę, próbując zaczerpnąć tchu. W chwili kiedy próbował znaleźć najwygodniejszą pozycję, usłyszał zbliżające się kroki. Przezornie pochylił głowę i skupił wzrok na metalowej kracie na której siedział. Nie wiedział kto się zbliża, ale nie miało to znaczenia. Nikt na tym statku nie był mu przychylny. Zobaczył parę wysokich wojskowych butów. Chłopak znieruchomiał. Mężczyzna się zatrzymał i postawił przed nim talerz i łyżkę. Przez chwilę przyglądał się zbiegowi. Więzień czuł to, mimo że nie podniósł głowy. Rozpoznał kapitana, ale skoro nie był pewny intencji mężczyzny, wolał nie reagować. Nie chciał nowych kłopotów. Metalowa łyżka wydawała mu się w tym momencie najbardziej fascynującym przedmiotem na świecie, skupił więc wzrok na niej. Wreszcie Malcolm odszedł, nie wypowiedziawszy ani jednego słowa. Więzień odczekał, aż jego kroki ucichnął, a wtedy na jego pokrwawionej twarzy pojawił się cień uśmiechu. Powoli sięgnął po łyżkę. ... -Wstawaj śmieciu! -ryknął rozwścieczony łowca i z całej siły uderzył chłopaka w twarz -Jeśli udajesz to cię zabiję! -Nie uzyskawszy żadnej reakcji, zaczął gwałtownie szarpać zwłoki. Chłopak przelewał mu się przez ręce. -Zatłukę cię! -krzyczał w bezsilnej złości i okładał pięściami nieruchome ciało. Więzień nawet nie drgnął, za to jego skóra zaczęła nabierać charakterystycznej woskowej bladości. Rozjuszony Cage uderzał z coraz większa siłą, jakby to mogło coś pomóc. Wreszcie zmęczony odrzucił bezwładne ciało i ciężko oparł się o balustradę. Był wściekły i skacowany. Stracił kupę kasy przez własną głupotę. Na dodatek zostały mu zwłoki, których chętnie pozbyłby się wyrzucając je w kosmos. Ale miał świadków. Jeden z nich, rudowłosa dziewczyna właśnie schodziła do ładowni zwabiona jego krzykami. Ją też mógłby uciszyć, tylko co potem? Nie da rady pozbyć się całej załogi. Postanowił zatrzymać ciało i pozbyć się go na planecie, w końcu za kilka godzin powinni lądować. Nikt z załogi nie wiedział jak cenny był więzień -przynajmniej taką nadzieję miał Cage. Nie pamiętał wszystkiego z poprzedniego wieczoru. Wiedział, że się upił i stłukł chłopaka. Jak widać dość porządnie, skoro ten wyzionął ducha. Łowca wyprostował się i podszedł do swojej ofiary. Zostawi zwłoki w pojemniku na śmieci w ładowni, a na planecie podrzuci je do planetarnej spalarki -planował. Miał uzasadnione przeczucie, że Sojusz nie pogłaszcze go po główce, za to co zrobił. Więzień miał wysoki priorytet i miał być żywy, za wszelką cenę. Schylił się, żeby podnieść ciało i z przerażeniem zobaczył wpatrujące się w niego zimne oczy. Nie zdążył zareagować gdy jego szyja znalazła się w zasięgu rąk ofiary. Zobaczył jeszcze błysk, czegoś metalowego co z niebotyczną siłą wbiło mu się w gardło. Zdumiony osunął się na ziemię. Kaylee, słysząc krzyki Łowcy właśnie wchodziła do ładowni. Była oburzona, głównie na kapitana. To jego statek, a pozwala żeby ten troglodyta znęcał się nad więźniem -rozważała zdenerwowana. Zawiodła się na nim, już ona mu powie co o tym wszystkim myśli. Nie widziała sceny, która właśnie rozegrała się między tropicielem i więźniem. Wychodząc zza rogu zobaczyła tylko zakrwawionego mężczyznę leżącego na ziemi. Kiedy podniosłą wzrok spojrzała w lufę pistoletu trzymanego przez chłopaka. -Tylko piśnij -wychrypiał z trudem łapiąc oddech -jeden trup więcej nie zrobi mi różnicy. Kaylee w przerażeniu uniosła powoli ręce. -Chodź -machnął jej bronią przed nosem, zmuszając by się obróciła. Podszedł do niej powoli i przysunął broń do jej pleców, tak żeby wyraźnie czułą lufę na skórze. -Do twojej kajuty -rozkazał -Nie próbuj mnie oszukać, wiem gdzie mieszkasz. Dziewczyna przerażona, ale posłuszna ruszyła przed siebie, modląc się w duchu żeby spotkali kogoś z załogi. Jej kajuta jako jedyna znajdowała się blisko ładowni, a co za tym idzie i maszynowni. Kiedy stanęli przed drzwiami usłyszała: -Gdzie trzymasz narzędzia? -Co? -udała, że nie rozumie, próbując przeciągnąć rozmowę. To była ostatnia szansa, żeby ktoś się pojawił. Kiedy zejdą do jej kajuty zostaną sami. Nerwowo przełknęła ślinę. -Narzędzia! -wysyczał wściekle chłopak -Przy wejściu. Nie musisz...-głos uwiązł jej w gardle, kiedy poczuła rozdzierający ból z tyłu głowy.[Chapter 4] -Kaylee! -Mal nerwowo naciskał guzik interkomu -Przyjdź na mostek. Już! -huknął. Gdzie do cholery jest ta dziewczyna. Miała pojawić się rano na mostku, żeby omówić kupno nowych części do silnika. Tak długo go o nie męczyła, a kiedy się wreszcie się zgodził, nawet nie raczyła się pojawić. -Czy ona myśli, że nie mam nic ważniejszego do roboty? -mruknął gniewnie. -Tak się składa sir, że pan nie ma -zauważył usłużnie Walsh, starając się powstrzymać śmiech. Kapitan nic nie odpowiedział, tylko posłał pilotowi ponure spojrzenie. -Pewnie śpi -dodał winowajca, starając się zachować powagę. -Dziękuję Walsh, za tę jakże cenną uwagę -zakpił Malcolm i ruszył do wyjścia. Wygląda na to, że będzie musiał wyciągnąć dziewczynę z łóżka. Zniechęcony skierował się w stronę maszynowni. Nie miał ochoty wydawać pieniędzy, których nie mieli, a teraz jeszcze musi gonić za mechanikiem po pokładzie. Po drodze zamierzał zajrzeć do ładowni. Sam fakt obecności tego dziwnego więźnia go drażnił. Wiedział, że nie ma wyjścia i musi pomagać takim typom jak Łowca, ale ten gówniarz-morderca, z którym nie wiadomo jak postępować, działał mu na nerwy. Marzył tylko, żeby jak najszybciej ich wysadzić. Przekraczając próg ładowni poczuł znajomy metaliczny zapach krwi. Odruchowo wyciągnął broń. Błędnie założył, że źródłem smrodu jest uwięziony chłopak, który powinien teraz leżeć z roztrzaskaną czaszką na trapie. Nie znalazł więźnia, tylko Łowcę z wyrazem zdziwienia w martwych oczach i fragmentem łyżki wystającym z zakrwawionej szyi. Ciemna kałuża poniżej świadczyła, że leży tu już jakiś czas. Szybki rzutem oka otaksował pomieszczenie. Łowca nie miał broni, a ładownia zdawała się pusta. Oznaczało to, że uzbrojony więzień czaił się teraz gdzieś na pokładzie. Podbiegł do interkomu. -Uwaga! -Krzyknął do mikrofonu - Więzień jest na wolności i jest uzbrojony -mocno zaakcentował ostatnie słowo- Wszyscy na mostek! ... -Wiem, ale wolałem go ostrzec, niż ryzykować życiem załogi -stwierdził Mal kwaśno, widząc potępiające spojrzenie Zoe. Dotarła pierwsza na mostek i od razu na niego naskoczyła. Sam wiedział, że interkom nie był najrozsądniejszym rozwiązaniem. Zadziałał instynktownie. Nie zastanawiał się nad konsekwencjami jeśli w grę wchodziło bezpieczeństwo jego załogi. -Kajuta Kaylee jest zamknięta od środka. Wołałem, ale nikt nie odpowiadał –wysapał Simon, który wpadł właśnie na mostek razem z River. -Obszedłem cały statek, nigdzie jej nie ma –Jane wkroczył do pomieszczenia dzierżąc w dłoniach swoją ulubioną „armtę\", którą pieszczotliwie nazywał Verą. Malcolm i Zoe wymienili spojrzenia. Myśleli o tym samym. -Chłopak zabił Łowcę mimo, że był poturbowany i skuty. Jest bardziej groźny niż przypuszczaliśmy. -Zabił? Czym, przecież nie miał broni? -zaskoczony Simon wpatrywał się w nich z niedowierzaniem. -Miał łyżkę. -Słucham? -lekarz pokręcił głową. Miał podejrzenie, że mężczyzna sobie z niego kpi. Z resztą nie pierwszy raz. -Wbił mu łyżkę w tętnicę –poinformował go uprzejmie Malcolm. -Skąd u licha wziął łyżkę? Wszystkie spojrzenia powędrowały w stronę kapitana, który pozostał niewzruszony. -Niewiarygodne -paplał dalej Simon nieświadomy napięcia, które zapanowało w sterowni -Musiał... -Tak -przerwał mu twardo Mal. -Już wiemy, że jesteś zaskoczony, ale może lepiej skupmy się na tym, że mamy na pokładzie uzbrojonego zabójcę. -Z zakładniczką. -O czym wy mówicie? -wtrącił się zniecierpliwiony Cobb - To zwykły gówniarz i to w kajdankach. Rozwalę drzwi moją Verą i po sprawie. -Jest w kajucie Kaylee -przypomniał mu delikatnie pasterz. -No i?- Jane powiódł wzrokiem po zebranych. -Kaylee jest mechanikiem -wyjaśnił powoli pasterz -W kajucie ma pełno narzędzi, więc o kajdankach możemy zapomnieć. Poza tym, nie jest chyba taki „zwykły\" skoro udało mu się zabić Łowcę. -A, no tak...-zrozumienie zaświtało w mózgu najemnika. -Powinien pan go wywołać, sir -zaproponowała Zoe -Nie ma dokąd uciec, więc musi pertraktować. ... -Mówi kapitan Malcom Reynolds -zabrzmiało z głośnika przy drzwiach maszynowni. Kaylee leżała nieprzytomna na podłodze, a chłopak zwijał się z bólu w przeciwległym kącie. Na rękach wciąż miał kajdanki, a upuszczony pistolet nurzał się w kałuży jego własnej krwi i wymiocin. Nawet gdyby chciał, nie byłby w stanie się ruszyć. Kolejne fale bólu przeszywały go z taką siłą, że chwilami nie mógł nawet oddychać. Z jednej strony bał się, że zaraz straci przytomność z drugiej o niczym innym nie marzył. Chciał tylko by to wszystko się skończyło. Kolejna fala uderzyła go ze zdwojoną siłą, zanim jeszcze zdążył otrząsnąć się z poprzedniej. Poczuł, że jego myśli się mącą, a on sam odpływa. Przyjął to z westchnieniem ulgi. -Czemu do cholery nie odpowiada? -Jane niecierpliwie ściskał \"armatę\". Nienawidził czekania. Był człowiekiem czynu, nawet jeśli to oznaczało zwyczajne robienie rozróby. Wszczynanie burd było jego wrodzonym talentem, który bardzo sobie cenił. Nie zajmował się pertraktacjami, to było dobre dla mięczaków. On wchodził, rozwalał kilka łbów, zbierał łup i się zmywał. Życie Jane'a było bardzo proste. Było, do czasu, aż zwerbował go Reynolds. Czasem tego żałował. Tak naprawdę, to żałował tego cały czas. -Może chce nas przeczekać -podpowiedział Walsh. -Albo zabił rudą i nie wie co robić -rzucił bezmyślnie Cobb, za co zarobił pełne oburzenia spojrzenia od reszty załogi. -Nie bądź taki wrażliwy, Cobb -sarknął Walsh. Najemnik tylko spojrzał tępo nie rozumiejąc ironii. -Możecie przestać? -przerwał im ostro kapitan. -Mamy martwego Łowcę na pokładzie, niebezpiecznego, uzbrojonego zbiega i porwanego mechanika. Więc jak możecie to się skupcie. … To był zły pomysł, właściwie fatalny. Patrząc na czerwoną plamę na kombinezonie, która z każdą sekundą stawała się coraz większa, był tego całkowicie pewien. Wraz z plamą rósł ból, paskudny i obezwładniający. „Czyli tak wygląda koniec?\" –przemknęło przez głowę więźnia zanim zapadł się w ciemność. -Żyje?- Pasterz Book wpatrywał się w Simona kucającego przy napastniku. Lekarz właśnie badał jego szyję w poszukiwaniu pulsu. -Jeszcze tak –odpowiedział -Ale będę musiał usunąć kulę. Mal nie zwracał na nich uwagi. Dla niego sprawa była zakończona, zrobił co powinien. Napastnik groził jego mechanikowi, więc go zastrzelił. Wiek chłopaka nie miał tu nic do rzeczy, na wojnie zabijał młodszych i wcale nie czuł się z tego powodu winny. A przynajmniej starał się o tym za często nie myśleć. Zoe pomogła oszołomionej Kaylee podnieść się z podłogi. Dziewczyna nie miała żadnych obrażeń, jeśli nie liczyć dużego guza z tyłu głowy i zamglonego spojrzenia, kogoś kto nie jest całkiem pewny gdzie się znajduje. Jane, który zaszedł napastnika z drugiej strony stał teraz z opuszczoną bronią, żałując że to nie on postrzelił chłopaka. Udało im się wpędzić chłopaka w pułapkę. Kierując się w stronę promu, którego zażądał, musiał przejść wąskim trapem nad ładownią. Tam go zablokowali z dwóch stron. Kapitan ostrzegł, że nie pozwoli mu zabrać Kaylee, ale jeśli ją puści to „może\" pozwoli mu żyć. Dzieciak chyba nie był pod wrażeniem oferty, bo próbował uciec zasłaniając się dziewczyną jak tarczą. Tylko, że na trapie nie miał dużego pola manewru. Z jednej strony Jane, mierzący do niego ze swojej armaty, a z drugiej kapitan i Zoe. -Puśćcie mnie, albo ona zginie –zagroził zachrypniętym głosem porywacz. -Myślisz, że jak ją zabijesz, to wyjdziesz stąd żywy? –głos kapitana nie wróżył nic dobrego. -Chyba mamy impas –stwierdziła twardo Zoe. Więzień zaczynał tracić zimną krew. Jakkolwiek się ustawił, nie mógł całkowicie zasłonić się zakładniczką. Co więcej, dziewczyna słaniała się na nogach od momentu kiedy wywlókł ją z kajuty. Była jego wielkości i zapewne podobnej siły, więc coraz trudniej było utrzymać ją w pozycji stojącej. Wreszcie poczuł jak mu się wyślizguje. Zdążył tylko zakląć kiedy próbował ją złapać. W tym momencie poczuł uderzenie w brzuch, a ból rozlał się po jego ciele rzucając go na podłogę. Pół godziny wcześniej Malcolm wywoływał chłopaka przez interkom -bezskutecznie. Więzień był zbyt zajęty wymiotowaniem i zwijaniem się z bólu by zareagować. Kiedy wreszcie otworzył oczy zobaczył nieprzytomną dziewczynę w kącie kajuty i brudną broń u swoich stóp. Próbował wstać. Przy drugiej próbie poszło mu już całkiem nieźle. Nie tylko udało mu się utrzymać na nogach, ale karuzela w jego głowie też nieco zwolniła. Podniósł broń z podłogi i ruszył do czegoś, co uznał za prowizoryczną łazienkę. Woda częściowo rozwiązała problem wymiocin i krwi. Opuszczając ją, zobaczył odbicie swojej pokiereszowanej twarzy w lustrze przy drzwiach. Odwrócił się od niego z odrazą. Wchodząc do kajuty rozejrzał się, szukając jakiegoś ubrania, którym mógłby zastąpić swoje śmierdzące ciuchy. Czysty kombinezon mechanika wiszący na oparciu krzesła, wyglądał bardzo zachęcająco. W chwili kiedy zapinał zamek z głośnika ponownie rozległ się głos: „Mówi kapitan Malcolm Reynolds. Wiemy, że masz naszego mechanika, więc jeśli chcesz żyć, lepiej się odezwij\". -Mistrz negocjacji –więzień uśmiechnął się pod nosem. ... ... ... -Niech mi ktoś pomoże przenieść go ambulatorium –Simon próbował zatamować ranę na brzuchu więźnia. -Odbiło ci, doktorku? –Jane spojrzał na niego jak na idiotę. -To morderca. Niech zdycha! –splunął pod nogi. -Pomogłem tobie, pomogę i jemu –aluzja w głosie Simona była czytelna, lecz nie dla najemnika. Nigdy by się nie domyślił, że lekarz wie o jego zdradzie sprzed miesiąca. Tylko Malcolm się zorientował i prawie go wtedy za to zabił. -Pomóż mu –nie znoszący sprzeciwu głos kapitana wyrwał go zza myślenia. -Ale to morderca… -To był rozkaz, Jane. Najemnik pokręcił z niedowierzaniem głową. Świetnie, jeszcze będą ratować gnojka zamiast go dobić. Zarzucił karabin na plecy i schylił się po więźnia. Zaskoczyło go jak lekki był chłopak. Nawet jak na nastolatka wydawał mu się dziwnie mały. Mal podszedł do Kaylee, która stała oparta o barierkę. Zoe lekko podtrzymywała ją za łokieć, bo dziewczyna niebezpiecznie się chwiała. -W porządku? –zapytał, schylając się nieco, żeby znaleźć się na wysokości wzroku dziewczyny. -Tak, chyba tak. Tylko głowa… –odpowiedziała niepewnie, patrząc nieprzytomnie w przestrzeń. -Walsh pewnie szaleje z niepokoju –Zoe spojrzała z nadzieją na kapitana. -Idź. Ja się nią zajmę –Mal, oparł ręce na ramionach dziewczyny, kiedy kobieta opuszczała ładownię. -Kaylee, spójrz na mnie –poprosił, ale dziewczyna nie zareagowała. Jej rozbiegane spojrzenie nadal błądziło po pomieszczeniu szukając jakieś punktu oparcia. -Spójrz na mnie –powtórzył, tym razem jego głos zabrzmiał ostrzej, a dziewczyna zatrzymała wzrok na jego twarzy. -Już w porządku –Kaylee zrozumiała i uśmiechnęła się blado. -Tak, już w porządku –powtórzyła bezwiednie, jakby smakując w ustach te słowa. -Niech Simon cię potem zbada –zarządził kapitan –A teraz idź się położyć. Była blada i osłabiona. Uderzenie w głowę nie tylko ją ogłuszyło, ale wytrąciło z równowagi. Najchętniej usiadłaby tutaj, żeby się zdrzemnąć. W tej chwili podłoga wydawała się jej całkiem wygodnym miejscem i faktycznie wykonała taki gest, jakby chciała usiąść, ale kapitan ją powstrzymał. -Nie tutaj –objął dziewczynę ramieniem i poprowadził do kajuty. Zapach jaki powitał go w pokoju skutecznie obrzydził mu ten pomysł. Podłoga była w fatalnym stanie. Wymiociny i krew pokrywały prawie cały jeden róg, a w kącie leżały cuchnące szmaty, które kiedyś były ubraniem uciekiniera. -Pokoje dla gości będą chyba lepsze –mruknął do siebie. Umieściwszy Kaylee w jednej z kajut ruszył do ambulatorium. Jane ułożył więźnia na łóżku zabiegowym. Wyglądał na nieprzytomnego, ale najemnik mu nie ufał. Kiedy Cage go przyprowadził, też sprawiał wrażenie niegroźnego dzieciaka, a potem załatwił Łowcę jakby to była bułka z masłem. -Powinieneś go przykuć –poradził lekarzowi, spoglądając na chłopaka. –Poprzednim razem jak oberwał, załatwił gościa jednym ciosem. -Poradzę sobie –odpowiedział niechętnie lekarz. Ostatnią rzeczą jakiej potrzebował, były rady od znienawidzonego najemnika –Chyba, że chcesz mi pomóc? –zapytał zaczepnie. -Nie ma mowy –mężczyzna zasłonił się obiema rękami i w pośpiechu opuścił ambulatorium. Rana mimo, że wyglądała na poważną nie musiała być groźna, przynajmniej tak zdawało się Simonowi. Puls chłopaka był stabilny, a jeśli kula ominęła najważniejsze narządy, więzień powinien przeżyć. Przez kilka chwil rozważał czy jednak nie przywiązać rannego. Jane może i był idiotą, ale faktycznie przeżyli szok kiedy zabił Cage'a. -Czemu nie jest przykuty? –kapitan właśnie wszedł i teraz przyglądał się drobnej postaci na łóżku. -Nie mam kajdanek, kaptanie – szybko skłamał Simon. Mężczyzna podszedł do jednej z półek w ambulatorium, z której wyjął samozaciskowe opaski. Jedną rzucił lekarzowi, a drugą zacisnął na nadgarstku więźnia i metalowej poręczy łóżka. -Przydałaby mi się pomoc przy operacji –rzucił lekarz w przestrzeń, nawet nie patrząc na Mala. -Poradzisz sobie, od tego tu jesteś –odpowiedział sztywno mężczyzna. -Może Pasterz Book, albo Zoe… -Powiedziałem, że sobie poradzisz –Malcolm uciął rozmowę i skierował się do drzwi. -Świetnie –westchnął Simon i zabrał się do rozcinania kombinezonu chłopaka.[Chapter 5] -Co to jest Walsh? –Zoe wpatrywała się intensywnie w ekran przed sobą. -Mnie to wygląda na zwykły wrak –stwierdził mężczyzna, opierając się wygonie w fotelu i obserwując aparaturę. –W każdym razie nie ma odczytów życia. Pasterz Book, który chwilę wcześniej pojawił się na mostku, z namysłem wpatrywał się w obiekt. -Chyba czekają nas żniwa –Walsh puścił oko do żony. -Lepiej tam nie wchodzić –wtrącił starszy mężczyzna. –Gdzieś już widziałem taką jednostkę. Możesz sprawdzić co to za statek? Pilot i jego żona wymienili porozumiewawcze spojrzenia. Nie rozumieli wzburzenia pasterza. Wiedzieli za to że, Book ukrywał więcej, niż kiedykolwiek zdecyduje się im powiedzieć. Malcolm raz go o to zapytał, ale dostał tylko wymijającą odpowiedź. Wszyscy podejrzewali, że mężczyzna musiał być kiedyś związany z Sojuszem, ale widać coś poszło nie po jego myśli, skoro zdecydował się to rzucić i zostać duchownym. -Poczekaj –mężczyzna skierował statek na kurs kolizyjny z wrakiem. Obiekt na ekranie zaczął się przybliżać. Mały, bardzo zniszczony statek, o podwójnym napędzie i brudnym kadłubie. Wyglądał bardzo staro i nieco upiornie. Walshowi skojarzył się z latającą kryptą. Pilot właśnie zamierzał zeskanować kody z kadłuba, gdy spanikowany pasterz krzyknął: -Wycofaj się! Szybko! Zaskoczony pilot zareagował instynktownie, omijając jednostkę szerokim łukiem. -O co chodzi? –Zoe wlepiła wzrok w mężczyznę. -To Kamikaze –wyszeptał pasterz jakby zdradzał im jakąś wielką i niebezpieczną tajemnicę. Szeroko otwartymi oczami wpatrywał się w okręt jakby właśnie ujrzał diabła. -Jest pan pewny? Nikt ich nigdy nie widział –nie dowierzała dziewczyna. -Ja taki widziałem –stwierdził kategorycznie pasterz –Tak właśnie wyglądał. Zoe otworzyła usta ze zdziwienia. Czy to możliwe? Słyszała o nich w czasie wojny, ale traktowała to bardziej jak legendę, którą próbowano przestraszyć przeciwników niż coś rzeczywistego. Po co tworzyć taki statek? Jaki sens w posiadaniu tak niszczycielskiej broni, nad którą się nie panuje? Przecież równie dobrze mógł się na nią natknąć statek Sojuszu lub zwykły pasażerki, nie było gwarancji, że zetknie się tylko z wrogiem. -To jakiś specjalna jednostka? –zapytał Walsh, nie zdając sobie sprawy, że właśnie uniknęli śmierci. -To statek pułapka, kochanie –Zoe czule dotknęła ramienia męża, ale widząc brak zrozumienia w jego oczach dodała –Coś jak olbrzymia mina, która zniszczy wszystko, co się tylko do niej zbliży. Mieliśmy szczęście, że się nie aktywowała. -Myślałem, że już ich nie ma –wezwany na mostek Malcolm z powątpiewaniem pokręcił głową. –Nie zostały rozbrojone? –spojrzał pytająco na pasterza. -Chyba wysadzone –odpowiedział starszy mężczyzna –Ich się nie da rozbroić. Są zbyt czułe. -Skąd to wszystko wiesz? –zniecierpliwiony Walsh oskarżycielsko przyglądał się Bookowi. Miał dość tych ciągłych tajemnic. – Jak go rozpoznałeś, skoro podobno nikt ich nigdy nie widział? Atmosfera w kokpicie stała się nieprzyjemna. Cała trójka wpatrywała się w pasterza czekając jak zmierza się wytłumaczyć. Co innego podejrzewać, że mężczyzna może mieć jakieś kontakty z rządem, a co innego być tego niemal pewnym. -Tylko raz w życiu taki widziałem – tłumaczył się pasterz –Stał w doku, był gotowy do wystrzelenia. To oświadczenie wcale nie poprawiło jego sytuacji. Podejrzenie, że może mieć coś wspólnego z tymi strasznymi statkami-pułapkami, również nie działało na jego korzyść. -Naprawdę? –odezwał się kapitan. Nadal wpatrywał się w ekran jakby o czymś intensywnie myślał. –Jak wysoko trzeba być postawionym w Sojuszu, by móc zobaczyć coś tak tajnego? –rzucił pasterzowi niechętne spojrzenie. Starszy mężczyzna uśmiechną się przyjaźnie: -Wystarczy być robotnikiem w doku, kapitanie. … -Kapitanie –nieświadomy niczego Simon zajrzał do pomieszczenia. –Mogę pana na chwilę prosić? -Nie teraz doktorze, mamy gigantyczną bombę na radarze. Simon szeroko otworzył oczy w niemym niedowierzaniu. -Choć nie sądzę żeby nam zagrażała –kapitan posłał mu krzywy uśmiech. -W takim razie -stwierdził lekarz chłodno -chciałbym jednak z panem porozmawiać, jeśli wolno. -Przyjdę za dziesięć minut –rzucił kapitan nawet nie patrząc w jego stronę. Chwilowo usatysfakcjonowany taką odpowiedzią chłopak wycofał się na korytarz. Postanowił, że później dopyta o co chodzi z tą niby bombą. Na razie jego głowę zaprzątało inne odkrycie. Wracając do ambulatorium wstąpił do Kaylee, którą Reynolds umieścił w jednej z kajut dla gości. Dziewczyna drzemała, a towarzystwa dotrzymywała jej River. -Jak ona się czuje? –zapytał cicho, wchodząc do pomieszczenia. -Właśnie zasnęła –odpowiedziała dziewczyna obrzucając przyjaciółkę lekko nieobecnym wzrokiem –Ale nic się nie martw –uśmiechnęła się do brata –Nic jej nie będzie. Ja to wiem. Simon pokiwał ze zrozumieniem głową. Jeśli River tak mówi, to znaczy że tak będzie. Dziewczyna miała niezwykły dar -była empatką. Nie tylko potrafiła wyczuwać emocje innych ludzi, niektórzy na statku wierzyli, że może nawet czytać w myślach. -Jak się obudzi, to powiedz, że kazałem jej wypoczywać –odpowiedział uśmiechem –Powiedz, że to oficjalne zalecenie lekarza. Malcolm instynktownie czuł, że ten statek-pułapka będzie problemem. Ich tendencja do pakowania się w kłopoty były o wiele za duża. Niewypał z czasów wojny wyglądał niewinnie, ale gdyby nie interwencja pasterza już by nie żyli. Nie zakładał z góry, że wszyscy w kosmosie są szabrownikami. Równie dobrze może przylecieć jakaś „dobra dusza\" i zechcieć udzielić pomocy nieszczęsnemu statkowi. Tylko czemu to musi by jego problem? To Sojusz stworzył te maszyny, więc niech on się o nie teraz martwi. Powinien to zgłosić –to był jego obywatelski obowiązek. Na sama myśl o tym skrzywił się. Nie miał ochoty na jakąkolwiek interakcję z rządem. Najchętniej zrobiłby to anonimowo, tylko czy wtedy ktoś się tym przejmie? Oprócz tego będzie się musiał wytłumaczyć jak rozpoznał statek-kamikaze. Nie, to Book będzie się tłumaczył –kapitan uśmiechnął się pod nosem. –Nie chce powiedzieć o swoich koligacjach z Sojuszem, to będzie rozmawiał z władzami. Malcolm nie ma nic do ukrycia –jeśli nie liczyć dwóch zbiegów, jednego super-więźnia i rządowego trupa w luku bagażowym, przypomniał mu cichy głos z tyłu głowy –ponownie się zasępił. -Walsh, odlatujemy. Kierunek bez zmian –zarządził i ruszył do ambulatorium. -Co było tak niecierpiące zwłoki, doktorze? –zapytał wchodząc do pomieszczenia. Simon właśnie kończył opatrywanie głowy pacjenta, który wciąż leżał nieprzytomny. Lekarz poderwał się na dźwięk głosu kapitana. -Nie uwierzy pan. –zaaferowany przerwał pracę –Nasz więzień to dziewczyna! -Dziewczyna? –Malcolm wpatrywał się z niedowierzaniem w drobną postać na łóżku. –Jest pan pewien, doktorze? -Tak, kapitanie. –sarknął zapytany -Kobieta, samica, płeć żeńska. Umiem odróżnić płeć. –dodał z naciskiem, urażony wątpliwościami mężczyzny. -Czyżby? Nigdy bym nie pomyślał –zauważył ironicznie Reynolds, posyłając mu złośliwy uśmiech. Zanim Simon zdążył na to zareagować, kapitan spoważniał. -I co ja mam z nią zrobić? –zapytał bardziej siebie niż chłopaka. -Cage chyba nie wiedział -lekarz już go nie słuchał, powrócił myślami do swojego odkrycia. –Może chciał to ukryć? Tylko jak można ukryć, że najbardziej poszukiwany zbieg w galaktyce, to dziewczyna? Poza tym był dość gadatliwy, powiedział wszystko, mimo że o nic nie pytaliśmy –kontynuował dyskusję z samym sobą jakby kapitana tam nie było. Malcom obserwował go przez chwilę. Chłopak mógł mieć rację i mogli to łatwo sprawdzić. -W jakim jest stanie? –zapytał, odrywając lekarza od konwersacji z samym sobą. -Ma sporo siniaków, kilka pękniętych żeber, ale to nic groźnego. Opatrzyłem otwarte rany, postrzał też nie był specjalnie groźny. -Nie o to pytałem –przerwał jego wywód Reynolds. -A o co? –zbity z tropu Simon, wpatrywał się w niego z oczekiwaniem. -Pytam czy ją zbadałeś Simon, dokładnie –zaakcentował ostanie słowo. Widząc, że chłopak nie nadąża za jego tokiem rozumowania, westchnął z rezygnacją. -Czy myślisz, że gdyby Cage wiedział, że jego więzień jest młodą dziewczyną, postąpiłby z nią tak samo jak z chłopakiem? Lekarz tylko wzruszył ramionami, niepewny dokąd zmierza ta rozmowa. -To zwierzęta Simon. Każdy z nich by skorzystał z okazji –wyjaśnił, posyłając mu znaczące spojrzenie. Ukryty sens słów kapitana wreszcie dotarł do chłopaka. Oczywiście –zasępił się. -Łowcy to brutalne zwierzęta. Czy gdyby, któryś dostał w swoje ręce River, tak właśnie by z nią postąpił? -Nie badałem jej pod tym kątem –wymamrotał niepewnie, nie patrząc w oczy mężczyzny. Malcolm obserwował go z czymś, co mógłby uznać za współczucie, gdyby nie fakt, że nie znosił chłopaka. Dzieciak był geniuszem, chirurgiem i świetnym lekarzem, ale niewiele wiedziała o życiu. Zwłaszcza o jego paskudnej stronie. -Więc to zrób –polecił. -Co? – Simon wpatrywała się w Malcolma wyraźnie zażenowany –Nie wydaje mi się, żeby to miało sens –paplał, starając się ukryć zmieszanie - Poza tym, nie jestem specjalistą w tej dziedzinie. Jestem chirurgiem. To nie znaczy, że nie umiem… -Kapitanie! –zaaferowana Zoe wpadła do ambulatorium, przerywając niezręczną rozmowę ku zadowoleniu chłopaka –Ten statek leci za nami! … -Jak to możliwe? –Malcolm wbiegł z Zoe na mostek. Simon podążał kilka kroków za nimi. –Mówiłeś, że jest pusty –zwrócił się bezpośrednio do Walsha. -Nie mam pojęcia co się dzieje –pilot z wyrazem paniki wpatrywał się w odczyty na monitorze. –Nie ściga nas. Wygląda jakby się przykleił. -Pasterzu Book? –Mal z nadzieją spojrzał na starszego mężczyznę, który tylko wzruszył bezradnie ramionami. Był równie zszokowany co inni. -Utrzymuje stałą odległość? –w głosie Malcolma wyczuwalne było napięcie. -Tak, ale… -Zmień kurs, Walsh i zwolnij –zakomenderował mężczyzna. -Czy to rozsądne? –wtrącił się Simon. -Walsh zrobi to tak, żebyśmy w razie czego zdołali uciec –kapitan z wyższością spojrzał w oczy lekarzowi –Ja cię nie pouczam jak masz badać pacjentów. Prawda Walsh? –rzucił przez ramię. Simon zaczerwienił się i spuścił wzrok. Pilot tylko pokiwał głową i ostrożnie zredukował prędkość, jednoczenie obserwując niebezpieczną jednostkę. -Zwolniła, sir. Odległość bez zmian –z ulgą oparł się w fotelu pilota. -Zatrzymaj się –rozkazał kapitan. Pozostali członkowie załogi wstrzymali oddech. Czy taki statek kamikaze może zaatakować? Dotychczas tego nie zrobił, tylko wlókł się za nimi jakby go holowali. Walsh wyłączył silniki. Serenity zawisła nieruchomo w pustce kosmosu. Wrogi statek również się zatrzymał. Nie przybliżał się, ani nie oddalał. -Co teraz, sir? –Zoe spojrzała z obawą na Malcolma. -Nie możemy tak tkwić w nieskończoność. -Więc spróbujmy mu uciec –zaproponował Walsh –Tylko przydałby się ktoś w maszynowni. -Może ja? –blada, ale uśmiechnięta Kaylee stanęła w drzwiach. Simon w ciągu sekundy znalazł się obok niej. -Co tu robisz? Miałaś nie wstawać –zganił ją delikatnie –Powinnaś odpoczywać. -Już odpoczęłam, a River powiedziała, że mnie potrzebujecie –posłała mu promienny uśmiech i puściła oko do kapitana. Simon obiecał sobie, że później porozmawia z siostrą na ten temat. Nie omieszka zapytać skąd w ogóle wiedziała, że coś się dzieje. -To prawda –Malcolm odpowiedział dziewczynie uśmiechem. -Z tego co zrozumiałam, mamy olbrzymią minę na ogonie, która nie chce się odczepić. -Nie ściga nas –dodała Zoe –ale też nie możemy się jej pozbyć. -Zejdź do maszynowni i czekaj na nasz sygnał –polecił jej kapitan. –Żeby uciec będziemy potrzebowali pełnej mocy silników. … -No to przynajmniej wszystko jasne –westchnęła Zoe dziesięć minut później –Nie pozbędziemy się go. Skąd on u licha ma energię? Przecież to zabytek! -Moglibyśmy gonić się po galaktyce, aż wyczerpie mu się paliwo –zasugerował jej mąż. -Chyba, że nasze wyczerpie się pierwsze –zrezygnowany kapitan usiadł na fotelu drugiego pilota. -To może wylądujmy –zaproponował Simon. Szybo zorientował się, że musiał powiedzieć coś bardzo głupiego, bo wszystkie oczy wpatrywały się w niego jakby był idiotą. -On nie wyląduje z nami. On się rozbije –wyjaśnił pilot. –Nikt z nas nie zamierza brać za to odpowiedzialności. -Nawet na pustej planecie? –dociekał Simon. -I tak zginiemy, bo rozbije się obok nas –zniecierpliwiony kapitan zakończył tę jałową dyskusję. … -Posprzątałem ten bajzel po więźniu –Jane wparował na mostek –Tylko czemu to zawsze ja muszę zajmować się brudną robotą? –spojrzał z wyrzutem na zebranych. -Bo jesteś z nas najsilniejszy, Jane –odpowiedział kapitan siląc się na powagę. Zoe i Walsh wymienili porozumiewawcze uśmiechy i tylko Simon zachował całkowity spokój. -Tak! –Jane wyprostował się na całą wysokość, nie zrozumiawszy ironii, ani nawet nie próbując doszukać się analogii miedzy brudem i siłą. –To prawda! -Co to u licha jest? -Jane właśnie dostrzegł okręt na ekranie radaru. -Statek-mina, który za nami leci, a my próbujemy się go pozbyć -wyjaśniła szybko Zoe. -Wysadzi nas? -zapytał najemnik z przerażeniem w oczach. -Nie sądzę –uspokoił go kapitan. -Mnie się wydaje, że faktycznie wzięliśmy go na hol –zauważył pasterz, który nie brał udziału w rozmowie, ale od kilkunastu minut głowił się nad rozwianiem ich problemu. -Jak? Przecież nic nie zrobiliśmy. -Pomyślmy logicznie –pasterz zapalił się do swojego pomysłu –Gdyby ten statek chciał nas zniszczyć, już by to zrobił, a nie wisiał nam na ogonie. Tak śmiercionośną broń tworzy się, żeby zbijała, a ona tego nie robi. Dlaczego? -Bo uważa nas za statek Sojuszu? –Malcolm właśnie załapał tok rozumowania mężczyzny. -Dokładnie! -pasterz uśmiechnął się szeroko. –Błędnie założyliśmy, że nawet Sojusz nie może nad nimi panować. A co jeśli się mylimy? Jeśli to jest właśnie jakieś zabezpieczenie? -To wciąż nie wyjaśnia dlaczego uważa nas za ich jednostkę –Malcolm nie był do końca przekonany. -Ale to by miało sens –Zoe przychylała się do opinii starszego mężczyzny. -Gdybyśmy wiedzieli jak aktywowaliśmy ten hol, moglibyśmy spróbować go wyłączyć.[Chapter 6] To nie było miłe przebudzenie. Pierwsza rzecz jaką poczuła, to palący ból z prawej strony brzucha, który stopniowo rozlewał się na całe ciało. Jeszcze zanim otworzyła oczy próbowała poruszyć rękami, bezskutecznie. Świadomość bycia unieruchomioną błyskawicznie ją ocuciła. Gwałtownie podniosła powieki, ale oślepiona białym światłem padającym z sufitu, szybko je przymknęła. -Szpital? -przemknęło jej przez głowę -Czy kostnica? To ostatnie skojarzenie było co najmniej dziwne. Przecież żyła, poza tym kto normalny przywiązuje zwłoki w kostnicy? Miękkie łóżko, na którym leżała, też nie przypominało stołu sekcyjnego. Ostrożnie rozejrzała się po pomieszczeniu. Wolała nie wykonywać gwałtownych ruchów i zdradzać, że się obudziła. Na szczęście jej obawy okazały się płonne, w pomieszczeniu nie było nikogo. Nieduża salka, w której się znajdowała sprawiała wrażenie ambulatorium. Do tej chwili nie zdawała sobie sprawy gdzie jest. Pomieszczenie wyglądało na stare, choć nieźle wyposażone. Założyła więc, że nadal musi być na Serenity, ambulatorium Sojuszu wyglądałoby zupełnie inaczej. Zerknęła na lewy nadgarstek, skórzana cienka bransoleta wciąż tkwiła na ręce. Odetchnęła z ulgą. Nie była pewna czego spodziewać się po załodze statku, choć doświadczenie podpowiadało, żeby zawsze spodziewać się najgorszego. Kapitan może i raz jej pomógł, ale to było na samym początku, kiedy to Cage zrobił sobie z niej worek treningowy. Niestety później wszystko się popsuło. Próbowała uciec, biorąc za zakładnika ich mechanika. Kapitan nieźle się wtedy wkurzył i teraz leżała z dziurą w brzuchu w ich ambulatorium. Oczywiście uratowali jej życie, w końcu żywa była więcej warta niż martwa. Przekrzywiła głowę do tyłu, żeby zobaczyć co jest za nią. Ból promieniujący od brzucha uderzył ze zdwojoną siłą, z jej ust wyrwał się bolesny jęk. Fatalnie -pomyślała –Dopóki jestem w takim stanie nic nie zdziałam. Mimo to sprawdziła czy w zasięgu rąk nie znajdzie się coś, co mogłaby użyć do obrony lub ataku. Blaty były idealnie posprzątane, a nawet gdyby udało się jej oswobodzić, to ból skutecznie uniemożliwiał wstanie z łóżka. Jeszcze jedna rzecz ją martwiła: osoba, która ją opatrzyła musiała zauważyć ,że jest dziewczyną. Cage nie wiedział, ale łowca był skończonym idiotą. Wolała nie myśleć, co by z nią zrobił gdyby się dowiedział. Teraz to już nie miało znaczenia, sytuacja się zmieniła. Zrobiła szybki ogląd. Leżała na samym środku pomieszczenia, na wprost drzwi wejściowych. Drzwi były oszklone do połowy, więc była dobrze widoczna z zewnątrz. Jak w akwarium –przemknęło jej przez głowę. Wzdłuż jednej ze ścian ciągnęła się przydymiona szyba, która przez różnicę jasności pomiędzy ambulatorium i korytarzami, sprawiała wrażenie czarnej. Gdyby ktoś tam teraz stał i ją obserwował, nawet by nie wiedziała. Ta myśl napawała ją niepokojem. Jak jakaś cholerna jaszczurka w terrarium –pomyślała ze złością. Nogi miała wolne, ale buty zniknęły. Pocieszała się, że pewnie stoją na ziemi, a ona nie może ich dostrzec, bo leży zbyt płasko. Zastanawiała się jak będą ją traktować, jej nowi „właściciele\". Cage pokazał, że może ją dręczyć jednocześnie zachowując przy życiu. Zabicie skurwiela było prawdziwą przyjemnością –pomyślała, uśmiechając się drapieżnie. Mimo to czuła, że jej sytuacja się pogorszyła. To niesprawiedliwe, że dziewczyna ma zawsze bardziej przesrane –westchnęła. Zastanawiała się nad kapitanem, Malcolm Reynolds był doprawdy zagadką. Wydawał się nieugięty i surowy, a jednak okazał jej łaskę. Czyżby litość była jego słabą stroną? Powinna to wykorzystać. Usłyszała ruch na zewnątrz, błyskawicznie zamknęła oczy i uspokoiła oddech. Osoba za drzwiami weszła i zbliżyła się do jej łóżka. -Czyli już nie śpisz –usłyszała spokojny, męski głos. Nie było w nim kpiny ani złości, tylko zwykłe stwierdzenie faktu. Mimo to nie poruszyła się, ani nie otworzyła oczu. -Odczyty cię zdradzają –usłyszała tuż przy uchu i mimowolnie drgnęła przestraszona. Nie było sensu dalej udawać, wiec podniosła wzrok. Nad jej łóżkiem pochylał się młody, przystojny mężczyzna o czarnych, zaczesanych do tyłu włosach. Już go widziała, to musiała być lekarz –oceniła. Chłopak przez chwilę przyglądał się jej z uwagą, zanim się odezwał: -To ja cię operowałem –stwierdził, jakby chciał się pochwalić. Nic nie odpowiedziała. Ona również obserwował go czujnym wzrokiem, czekając na ciąg dalszy, który jednak nie nastąpił. Simon odwrócił się do niej tyłem i podszedł do jednej z półek. -Kapitan jest wściekły, a z nim lepiej nie zaczynać –rzucił przez ramię. Z szuflady wyjął fiolkę i strzykawkę. Dziewczyna poruszyła się niespokojnie na łóżku, wywołując kolejną falę bólu. Lekarz w tym czasie zdążył napełnić strzykawkę. Nigdy nie pochwalał torturowania więźniów, zwłaszcza jeśli były nimi młode dziewczyny. -Pewnie straszni cię boli –zauważył, widząc grymas cierpienia na twarzy więźnia. Kiedy zbliżył igłę do jej ręki, dziewczyna cała się spięła, jakby próbowała się odsunąć. -To tylko środek znieczulający –powiedział łagodnie. –Brzuch będzie cię mniej bolał. Nieco się odprężyła, może jej sytuacja nie była tak zła jak założyła. Lekarz wydawał się sympatyczny. Nie musiał nic do niej mówić, a już na pewno nie musiał być dla niej miły. Zanim wbił igłę, przetarł jej skórę wacikiem nasączonym spirytusem, co zauważyła z pewną satysfakcją. Troszczył się –kolejna rzecz do zapamiętania. Łatwo go będzie zjednać, na tę myśl niemal uśmiechnęła się triumfalnie. Simon przyglądał się jej twarzy. Było mu jej żal, choć wiedział, że nie powinno. Miała na sumieniu sto dwadzieścia osób –sto dwadzieścia jeden –poprawił się w myślach. Jednak o River też wygadywali niestworzone rzeczy, z których żadna nie była prawdą. Nie potrafił przestać porównywać obu dziewczyn, mimo że bardzo się starał. Dziewczyna na stole była drobną, lecz w pełni rozwiniętą kobietą, o czym zdążył się już przekonać usuwając kulę. Nie wiedział ile ma lat. Małe piersi, jak u nastolatki z łatwością mogła ukryć pod elastycznym bandażem i luźną odzieżą. Nie miała wyrazistych, kobiecych bioder. Właściwie to była bardzo chuda, a jej androgeniczna uroda pozwalała ukrywać się w przebraniu chłopak. Dodatkowy problem stanowiły rysy twarzy, teraz praktycznie nieczytelne pod siniakami i opatrunkami. No i włosy, krótkie jak u żołnierza, szare i postrzępione. Zastanawiał się czy jest nieletnia. Chyba nie. O ile jako chłopak mogła sprawiać wrażenie nastolatka –głównie przez chudość i niski wzrost, o tyle jako kobieta spokojnie mogła uchodzić za dwudziestoparolatkę. Jego rozmyślania przerwało wejście Malcolma. Mężczyzna nie zwracając uwagi na lekarza, stanął przy łóżku dziewczyny obrzucając ją taksującym spojrzeniem. Nic nie mówił, tylko błądził wzrokiem po jej twarzy, jakby chciał z niej coś wyczytać. Było to bardzo denerwujące. Dziewczyna spojrzała na niego z ukosa, rzucając mu nieme wyzwanie. Nie da się zastraszyć, zwłaszcza teraz kiedy środek przeciwbólowy zaczynał działać. -Jak się nazywasz? –zapytał wprost. Jego wzrok ostrzegał, że zorientuje się jeśli dziewczyna skłamie. -Kaleb –opowiedziała odruchowo, było to imię pod jakim jej poszukiwano. Mężczyzna zmrużył oczy. Zaczynał ją denerwować. To nie było spojrzenie brutalnego, ale głupiego łowcy. To było coś innego i to coś wywoływało w niej niepokój. -A naprawdę? -Kaleb –powtórzyła tym razem mniej pewnie. -Nie sądzę. Kaleb to imię męskie –wyraźnie zaakcentował ostatnie słowo. No tak, to oczywiste. Nigdy nie zaakceptują tego imienia, teraz kiedy już znają prawdę. Zastanawiała się czy nie wymyślić na poczekaniu jakiegoś innego, ale nic nie przychodziło jej do głowy. Z resztą jakie to ma teraz znacznie? Cała ta rozmowa wydawała się absurdalna. -Właściwe to nie mam imienia –skapitulowała, odwracając wzrok. -Ale jakoś musieli się do ciebie zwracać w kolonii –mężczyzna nie dawał za wygraną. -Jestem uczniem klasy A –odpowiedziała niechętnie –15. To mój… numer –nagle zrobiło się jej wstyd. Miała numer zamiast imienia i nazwiska. Zupełnie jakby była przedmiotem –pomyślała gorzko. -Dobrze –usłyszała nad sobą głos kapitana –Będę cię nazywał Al. Czyżby właśnie dostała imię? Kiedy podniosła zaskoczony wzrok, mężczyzna już na nią nie patrzył. Gestem nakazał lekarzowi iść za sobą i obaj opuścili ambulatorium. Wyszli na zewnątrz. Malcolm zablokował drzwi i ustawił się tak, żeby nie mogła widzieć jego twarzy. -Chcę żebyś się nią zajął –zwrócił się do Simona. Młodszy mężczyzna mylnie zinterpretował słowa kapitana i zaczął się bronić. -Już mówiłem, że nie jestem specjalistą… -Nie o to mi chodzi –Reynolds przerwał mu w pół zdania –Chcę ją przenieść do wolnej kuty. To będzie jej areszt, dopóki nie dolecimy na Laudos. Ty się po prostu nią zajmij. Dbaj, żeby miała co jeść i zmieniaj jej opatrunki. Nic więcej od ciebie nie oczekuję. Simon przytaknął, nie było to nic trudnego. Sam założył, że tak postąpi zanim jeszcze kapitan o tym wspomniał. -Tylko pamiętaj z kim masz do czynienia –Malcolm dodał ostro, widząc nazbyt zadowoloną minę lekarza. –To nie jest biedna dziewczynka napadnięta przez złych ludzi i to nie jest twoja siostra –znacząco spojrzał na lekarza. To faktycznie był problem i kapitan go wyczuł. Simon wiedział, że będzie się musiał pilnować. -Dobrze –kapitan klepnął go w ramię uważając rozmowę za zakończoną –Rozumiem, że nie muszę ci przypominać o kajdankach. Lekarz tylko przytaknął skinieniem głowy. -Pierwsza zła wiadomość jest taka, że Kaylee nic nie znalazła –Zoe właśnie zbliżyła się do nich i z ciekawością zajrzała do ambulatorium. Dziewczyna na łóżku miała zamknięte oczy jakby spała. -Niedawno się obudziła –lekarz uprzedził pytanie kobiety –Ale nie jest chętna do rozmowy. -Ma na imię Al. –kapitan celowo posłużył się imieniem, które nadał dziewczynie kilka chwil temu. -Czyli to prawda, to dziewczyna –bardziej stwierdziła niż zapytała Zoe. –Nie dziwię się, że woli udawać chłopaka, na jej miejscu zrobiłabym tak samo. Malcolm rzucił jej zdziwione spojrzenie. Od kiedy to Zoe odczuwa porozumienie dusz z mordercami? -Druga zła wiadomość jest taka, że Walsh wszystko sprawdził –kobieta podjęła przerwany wątek – i nic co zrobiliśmy nie powinno wywołać takiej reakcji statku. Dobrze wiedzieli co to oznacza. Znaleźli się w pułapce i prawdopodobnie będą musieli opuścić statek. Sojusz chętnie zdetonuj zagubioną minę, ale wraz z nią wysadzą też Serenity, skoro nie można jej odłączyć. Zoe spojrzała ze współczuciem na Malcolma. Dla niego to koniec, ten statek był całym jego życiem. Sojusz nie będzie się poczuwał do jakiegokolwiek zadośćuczynienia, bo niby czemu? Jako byli żołnierze, walczący przeciw Sojuszowi nie znaczyli nic. Zwykli banici i przemytnicy, taką opinię mieli w ich oczach. Nie potrafiła sobie wyobrazić Malcolma robiącego cokolwiek innego, co z resztą miały robić? Uwięziony na jednej z prymitywnych planet –nigdy nie zgodzi się osiąść na rozwiniętej planecie Sojuszu - będzie „przykuty do ziemi\", jak sam to kiedyś określił gdy rozmawiali o osadnictwie. To nie było życie dla niego. On musiała być niezależny i wolny, a tylko własny statek mógł dać mu tę wolność. Sytuacja Simona i River będzie jeszcze gorsza. Byli zbyt charakterystyczni, by ukryć się nawet na pograniczach. Dlatego Malcolm zgodził się przyjąć ich na statek, a teraz nie będą się mieli gdzie podziać. Pogrążeni w niewesołych rozważaniach nawet nie zauważyli, że więzień ma otwarte oczy i uważnie im się przygląda. -Nie mamy wyjścia –stwierdził beznamiętnie kapitan, choć ciężko mu było zachować spokój. –Walsh niech przywróci poprzedni kurs –zarządził –kiedy znajdziemy się na orbicie, trzeba będzie przepakować towar na prom i skontaktować się z władzami. Zoe tylko smutnie pokiwała głową.[Chapter 7] -Mamy opuścić statek? –Jane wpatrywał się w Zoe z niedowierzaniem –Na jak długo? -A jak myślisz? –kobieta czuła się zmęczona głupotą najemnika. Jakoś wszyscy potrafili to zrozumieć, tylko on jeden nie wiedział co do niego mówią. -I co potem? –mężczyzna nie chciał popuścić. -Domyśl się, Jane –burknęła zniecierpliwiona Zoe. –Nie mamy pieniędzy na inny statek, a ten trzeba będzie wysadzić, więc...? Najemnik patrzył na nią zbaraniałym wzrokiem, jakby dwie samotne komórki w jego mózgu próbowały wszystko połączyć w całość. -To co będzie z nami? –wydukał oszołomiony W tym momencie Zoe zwątpiła w ludzkość, w sens istnienia i życie jako takie. Nie miała ochoty na ciągnięcie tej bezsensownej dyskusji, pokręciła z dezaprobatą głową. -Idiota –westchnęła pod nosem, tak żeby mężczyzna jej nie usłyszał. -Walsh –zwróciła się do męża –ustaw kurs z powrotem na Laudos. -Już to zrobiłem. Oboje czekali, aż najemnik sobie pójdzie i zostaną sami. Ten jednak najwyraźniej nigdzie się nie wybierał, stojąc za nimi wpatrywał się w ekran statku. -Może porozmawiasz o tym z kapitanem? –zaproponowała kobieta. Widziała, że to nie fair w stosunku do Malcolma, ale bardzo chciała się pozbyć mężczyzny i zostać z mężem sama. Jane najwyraźniej zapalił się do pomysłu, bo błyskawicznie opuścił sterownię, mrucząc do siebie coś pod nosem. -Sprawa jest przesądzona? –zapytał Walsh w przestrzeń, gdy tylko zostali sami. -Tak. Nie możemy nawet wylądować, żeby zabrać paliwo. -Zoe, ja jestem pilotem –powiedział cicho jej mąż. Nie musiał niczego dodawać. Kobieta oparła dłoń na jego ramieniu. Jaka była szansa, że zostaną przyjęci razem na jakikolwiek statek? Nigdy nawet się nie zastanawiali nad taką możliwością. Liczyli, że zestarzeją się razem na Serenity, albo zginą, co chyba było bardziej prawdopodobne przy ich trybie życia. -Wiem, skarbie –uścisnęła ramię męża. Simon niecierpliwie krzątał się po ambulatorium. Właściwie nie miał nic do roboty, ale chciał czymś się zająć, czymkolwiek, byle tylko nie musiał iść do River. Jak miał jej przekazać, że za kilka godzin stracą dom? Wolał nie zastanawiać się nad ich przyszłością. Żyli z dnia na dzień i to było dobre życie, może nie najlepsze, ale dobre. Do przeszłości nie było już powrotu, rodzina się od nich odcięła, a River już zawsze będzie poszukiwana. Jaką mogli mieć przyszłość? Nawet nie śmiał niczego planować na dwa dni do przodu. Oczy dziewczyny, leżącej na łóżku, podążały za każdym jego krokiem. Obserwowały go kiedy po raz trzeci przestawiał pojemniki z wacikami i układał strzykawki. Wiedziała co się dzieje, ale nie chciała zdradzić jak weszła w posiadanie tych informacji. Simon był najinteligentniejszy z załogi. Jego siostry w ogóle nie brała pod uwagę -dziewczyna była zbyt szalona. -Przypadkiem podsłuchałam waszą rozmowę –odezwała się –myślę, że mogłabym pomóc. Lekarz spojrzał na nią, jakby właśnie wybudził się z głębokiego snu. Zbyt zajęty własnymi ponurymi myślami, nie przyszło mu do głowy zapytać, jak udało się jej podsłuchać ich rozmowę. -W czym? –zapytał, wciąż jeszcze nie do końca obecny duchem. -Mogę odłączyć was od tego kamikaze, a przynajmniej spróbować… -O czym ty mówisz? –lekarz potrząsnął głowa, jakby próbował pozbyć się natrętnych myśli. -Jestem programistką. Najlepszą w naszej galaktyce, a może i pozostałych –ciągnęła niezrażona reakcją mężczyzny. Simon patrzył na nią, jakby widział ją po raz pierwszy. Co ona kombinuje, przebiegło mu przez głowę? Pewnie chce się uwolnić, korzystając z kłopotów w jakich się znaleźli. Tylko jak zamierza to zrobić? -I niby jak chcesz nas odłączyć, skoro ani Walsh, ani Kaylee tego nie mogą? -Wybacz, ale Walsh jest pilotem, a Kaylee mechanikiem. Ja mówię o przeprogramowaniu statku. To kwestia komend –wzruszyła ramionami, jakby to była najoczywistsza rzecz na świecie. Celowo nie nazwała tego, co będzie musiała zrobić, po imieniu. Wspomnienie o wirusie, bez którego zapewne się nie obejdzie, mogłoby przywołać niekorzystne dla niej skojarzenia. Jeśli chciała się uwolnić, musiała działać ostrożnie. -Nawet jeśli, to kapitan nigdy się na to nie zgodzi –stwierdził sceptycznie. –Nie uwolni ludobójcy, by ratować maszynę. -Kto mówi o uwolnieniu? Ja chcę tylko, żebyście dali mi kilka dni na uporządkowanie moich spraw, a potem możecie mnie zawieźć na Laudos –starała się brzmieć jak najbardziej szczerze. -I tak się nie zgodzi, ale możesz z nim porozmawiać -skapitulował lekarz. To nie był dobry pomysł, ale się zgodził. Dziewczyna twierdziła, że może odłączyć ich statek, więc czemu miałby przejmować się rządem? Nie był nic winny Sojuszowi, dla niego liczył się tylko statek i załoga. To wszystko co miał. -Mogę to zrobić –zapewniała go kiedy przyszedł do ambulatorium. -Jak? –zapytał krótko, był już zmęczony całą tą sytuacją. -Mówiłam już lekarzowi –wskazała głową na Simona, który nieudolnie maskował podniecenie, bawiąc się butelką wody. –Potrzebuje tylko dostęp do waszych komputerów i mocny nadajnik. Włamię się do systemu i go zmienię. To wszystko. -To niemożliwe –sprzeciwiła się Kaylee, która właśnie pojawiła się w drzwiach ambulatorium. Przyszła tu wiedziona ciekawością i przypadkiem podsłuchała rozmowę. Nie patrzyła na dziewczynę, tylko bezpośrednio zwróciła się do Malcolma. -Nie dla mnie –zaoponowała Al. Tak bardzo chciała, żeby dali jej szansę, to była jej jedyna nadzieja. Muszą jej uwierzyć. Jeśli rozwiąże ich kłopot, to będzie jak prezent od losu. Nie była pewna czy się jej uda, mimo że zgrywała pewną siebie. W zamian mogłaby zażądać wolności, choć Simon miał rację, na to się nigdy nie zgodzą. Wbrew pozorom byli prawi no i jeszcze ten niby Pasterz udający świętego... Ale to nic, myślała, wystarczy że dostanie trochę czasu, kilka dni, może tydzień. W ciągu tygodnia wiele się może zdarzyć, ale żeby cokolwiek się wydarzyło, najpierw muszą jej uwierzyć. -Byłam programistką w Kolonii –ciągnęła –jeśli mi się nie uda, to trudno, odstawicie mnie na Laudos. Ale jeśli was odłączę… -zawiesiła głos, pozwalając by wyobraźnia kapitana pracowała. Niemal słyszała trybiki w jego głowie, kiedy zamyślony wpatrywała się w ścianę za nią. -A w zamian? –zapytał, a Al niemal podskoczyła z radości. -Wiem, że się nie zgodzicie, na uwolnienie mnie, ale… -Dobrze –stwierdził kapitan, przerywając jej w pół słowa –Ja się zgadzam. Zrób co masz zrobić, a ja cię uwolnię. Nie czekając na reakcję obecnych, obrócił się i wyszedł, zostawiając ich z otwartymi ustami i porządnym mętlikiem w głowach. Kaylee odprowadziła Malcolma zdumionym spojrzeniem, nie dążyła zareagować, a Simon tylko spuścił wzrok. Wiedział, że powinien coś powiedzieć, powinien zaoponować, zachować się honorowo i nie zgodzić na taką wymianę, w końcu zawsze uważał się za moralnie lepszego niż reszta załogi. Ale nie zrobił tego, nie zrobił nic. Może nie poprawiało to jego samooceny, ale zwiększało szanse na przeżycie River. W tym momencie był to dla niego stan zadowalający. Za to Kaylee była oburzona, spojrzała na Simona, szukając poparcia, ale on najwyraźniej unikał jej wzroku. Rzuciła, zadowolonemu z siebie więźniowi, nienawistne spojrzenie i pobiegła z kapitanem. Al nie posiadała się z radości, takiego obrotu spraw się nie spodziewała. Może Mal wcale nie był taki prawy na jakiego pozował? Tym lepiej dla niej. Wszyscy ludzie są tacy sami, uśmiechnęła się w duchu. Wszyscy są dobrzy i szlachetni, do czasu kiedy w grę wchodzi ich własny interes. Gdyby tylko mogła wybuchłaby śmiechem. Kaylee dopadła Malcolma, gdy ten wchodził na mostek. -Zamierza pan wypuścić mordercę?! –krzyknęła rozwścieczona. Walsh i Zoe gwałtownie obrócili się na dźwięk jej głosu. -To psychopatka! –piekliła się dziewczyna. –Zabiła 120 niewinnych ludzi, a potem poderżnęła gardło Cage'owi. Mal miał ochotę ją poprawić, o ile dobrze pamiętał, nie było żadnego podrzynania gardeł. Z trudem zachowując cierpliwość, przyglądał się rozwścieczonemu mechanikowi. Ostatnio wszyscy uparli się podważać jego decyzje, jeszcze chwila i dojdzie do buntu, bo zupa w kantynie była za słona. -Skończyłaś? –zapytał spokojnie, kiedy dziewczyna przerwała by zaczerpnąć tchu. -Nie! –krzyknęła nadal wściekła, ale jej impet zaczynał wyhamowywać. Nie wiedział co jeszcze mogłaby powiedzieć, więc zamilkła. Kapitan tylko pokręcił głową zniecierpliwiony. -Ona uwolni nas –powiedział głosem nie znoszącym sprzeciwu – a ja uwolnię ją. To już postanowione, jeśli ci się to nie podoba, możesz opuścić statek. Droga wolna. Kaylee zatkało, takiego postawienia sprawy się nie spodziewała. Nic nie odpowiedziała, więc kapitan dodał: -Skoro jednak zamierzasz zostać, to wracaj do maszynowni –obrócił się do niej plecami. Dziewczyna przez chwilę stała, nie wiedząc jak się zachować, po czym ruszyła sztywno przed siebie. -Chcecie coś dodać? –kapitan wciąż w bojowym nastroju, zwrócił się do Zoe i jej męża. Oboje jak na komendę pokręcili przecząco głowami. -Dobrze –zawyrokował. –W takim razie, Walsh przygotuj wszystko. Nasz więzień odłączy nas od miny, a przynajmniej tak twierdzi, tylko potrzebuje komputerów i silnego nadajnika. Jak skończysz, daj mi znać, będę u siebie. Reynolds ruszył do swojej kajuty. Był zły i zmęczony. Nic dzisiaj nie układało się po jego myśli. Kiedy już będzie po wszystkim, wyrzuci tego męczącego więźnia na jakiejś pustej planecie i zapomni o nim, obiecał sobie. A potem polecą na jedną z tych miłych, ciepłych, zagubionych planet. Podobno na Uranos jest wspaniale, tak twierdził jego dawny znajomy z wojska. Mało turystów, bo nie ma kurortów ani hoteli i mało ludzi Sojuszu, bo nie ma czego pilnować. Będą się lenić cały dzień, tylko piasek, plaża i łowienie ryb. Malcolm nigdy nie łowił ryb, ale słyszał, że to odpręża. Taaak, rozmarzył się, słodkie nic nierobienie. Jego myśli przerwał brutalny dźwięk interkomu: -Wszystko gotowe, sir. Z niechęcią zwlekł się z łóżka, na którym położył się zaledwie kilka minut wcześniej. -Już idę -odpowiedział, przyciskając guzik urządzenia i skierował się do ambulatorium. -Doktorze, przygotuj ją, nie chcę żadnych niespodzianek –powiedział, wchodząc do pomieszczenia. Było to całkowicie niepotrzebne, Simon zdążył uprzedzić jego prośbę i podał pacjentce hydrofolinę. Dzięki temu środkowi, dziewczyna była w pełni przytomna, jednak jej ruchy przypominały pływanie w kisielu. -Jest gotowa, kaptanie –odpowiedział lekarz, który właśnie opatulał więźnia kocem. Mal skinął głową i wyjął skalpel z szuflady. Dwoma szybkimi ruchami przeciął więzy na nadgarstkach dziewczyny. Al wykonała ruch jakby chciała się podnieść, co jak się przekonała, wcale nie było takie łatwe. Kapitan przytrzymał ją za ramię, przyciskając do poduszki. –Nawet się nie wysilaj –powiedział i wsunął prawą rękę pod jej kolana. Chwilę później podniósł ją lekko razem z kocem. –Nasz pan doktor, podał ci lek, po którym nawet nie ustoisz na nogach. Faktycznie czuła się słaba, chciała machnąć ręką, ale ręce chyba ważyły z tonę. Miała wrażenie, że to jeden z tych snów, kiedy zachowujesz pełną przytomność, ale twoje ruchy są spowolnione. Poruszyła palcami, sprawne, przynajmniej one działały. -Będziecie mnie tak szprycować? –zapytała, siląc się na uśmiech. -To zależy od ciebie –odpowiedział kapitan. Przez chwilę martwiła się czy się nie zesika, skoro jej mięśnie były, aż tak rozluźnione, było to całkiem możliwe. Nawet jeśli, to trudno, pomyślała, obsika Malcolma. To będzie jego kara za takie traktowanie \"gościa\", stwierdziła z zadowoleniem. Reynolds zaniósł ją na mostek i usadowił w fotelu Walsha. W pomieszczeniu oprócz pilota była również Zoe i Kaylee, która nadal obrażona na Mala, starała się nawet na niego nie patrzeć. Jednak ciekawość była silniejsza i dziewczyna musiała przyjść, choćby po to, by móc triumfować gdy więzień poniesie porażkę. Jane, również się pojawił i wprowadzony w szczegóły, teraz zażarcie dyskutował o czymś z Pasterzem. -Tylko nie próbuj żadnych sztuczek –ostrzegł ja Walsh, starając się brzmieć groźnie. –Będę patrzył ci na ręce. Al zbyła to ostrzeżenie lekceważącym uśmiechem. Wiedziała, że to tylko blef, z resztą tylko kapitan się tu liczył, o czym zdążyła się już przekonać, w ciągu kilku ostatnich dni. Jane to przygłupi mięśniak z mózgiem wielkości orzeszka, Kaylee -mała obrażalska dziewczynka, z której zdaniem nikt się nie liczy, a Zoe i Walsh... noc cóż, co do nich nie wyrobiła sobie jeszcze zdania. Z resztą nie ważne, wszyscy mogą patrzeć i tak nic nie zrozumieją. W miedzy czasie, powinna dać radę sprawdzić sygnał, który śledziła od ponad dwóch miesięcy. Nie było szans, żeby zorientowali się co robi. Zabrała się do pracy.

The tribunal that sat before him was made up of two men and a woman. The man in the middle was tall with grey hair, resembling a judge or an aged preacher. The other man on the right had snow white hair, laid back along his bony crown. The woman that sat on the left had jet black hair with several streaks of grey in her hair. None were old, but they had all left their prime years ago. They stared coolly at him and he stared coolly back. His eyes held nothing, but his captors' eyes were filled with a venomous hate. The grey haired man crossed his hands and leaned forward over the desk. \"Sir, we entrusted you with this task of preventing certain information from becoming public knowledge in the belief that you would not stop until the task was done. Tell us; were we wrong to trust you with this critical mission?\" The Operative stared forward. \"No sir\", he calmly replied. \"Then why did you not succeed in killing this seventeen year old girl?\" the woman said, her hand twisting a strand of hair. \"A better question\", the third man spoke, \"is why did you not finish with the job when she was within your reach?\" \"I did not see it as necessary for more blood to be spilled. What she knew had been…\" \"Publicized?\" the woman dryly muttered. The Operative looked at her and said, \"Revealed. I did not find her to be a threat since the secret I assume you had me silence had been made apparent to the solar system.\" \"If that were the only secret she knew, you would not be here now\", the white haired man said. \"You would be in a cell awaiting execution for treason.\" The Operative looked at him, his face revealing no emotion. \"I had no knowledge of this.\" \"What were your orders?\" the grey haired man asked, looking through his glasses at a piece of paper. \"To capture or kill the girl, with the use of any force necessary.\" \"And was there anything about the mission ending if certain secrets were leaked out?\" \"No sir.\" \"Then why did you not complete the mission?\" the white haired man asked, anger welling up in his voice. The Operative did not respond. \"Very well\", the grey haired man said. \"For your crimes against the Alliance, you will be discharged from duty effective immediately and we decree death for the act of treason. And due to your vast experience with avoiding danger, we have decided that vaporization shall be your method of death. The execution will take place in twelve days' time.\" He waved his hand once and said, \"Guards.\" Four guards stepped forward and aimed their guns at the Operative. The fifth guard came forward with a needle and injected its contents into his arm. His face remained still as his vision grew blurry and his hearing dulled. He heard only four words before sleep overcame him. \"Bring us Charles Dante.\"[Chapter 2] Dust rolled through the streets of Deadmoon as Mal jumped off the cruiser. He knew that they shouldn't pull a heist so soon after blowing the lid off Miranda, but there was no other option. They were low on supplies and despite their care, the crews rushed maintenance was starting to show on the ship. He was already out several fuel rods and his heat shields looked like they were about to burn off the ship. He thought that they would burn off the day before when they landed on this Polythian moon. He put his hand on his gun and nodded to Jayne and Zoe. They followed Mal to the bank while Inara stayed in the cruiser, ready to go as soon as the trio finished their business. Zoe pulled out her rifle and held it by her side, out of sight by ready to fire. Jayne kept his machine gun in his jacket. The giant weapon created a large bulge along the left side of his body. Mal looked at Jayne and said, \"Do you think that gun's big enough.\" \"Well, seeing as how I don't have any grenades, it's just right.\" \"I've already told you, you don't need a grenade.\" \"Yeah, look what happened last time you said that.\" \"Ladies\", Zoe said sternly. \"Are we going to get the money or argue over who has the bigger gun.\" She turned and walked into the bank. Mal looked at Jayne and shrugged before following her in. Immediately, he pulled out his gun and hit the guard on his right in the throat with the gun handle before pointing it at the guard across the room. The guard's hand dropped towards his gun, but stopped after taking a look at Jayne's gun. \"Take the gun out of the holster with your two fingers and toss it to me\", Hal ordered. \"Do it slowly, and you'll make it out of here alive.\" The guard did as he told and tossed the gun to Jayne. Jayne kicked it to Hal who picked it up and put it in his belt. \"You just won brightest cop of the day\". \"Now everybody get down on the ground! This is a robbery,\" Zoe yelled. \"If anyone moves wrong, gives me a bad feeling, or even breathes funny, I'll blow your head off.\" The few people that were there quickly fell to the ground, covering their heads as they turned their heads to watch their captors. Mal quickly walked up to the teller and kicked the metal grate between him and the tellers. Wood shattered as the grate broke off the wooden frame that held it up. He nimbly leaped over the counter and kicked the teller as he reached for underneath the desk. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" He rounded them up and pushed them through the door to join the rest of the captives. He then began walking between the cowering prisoners. \"Now, let's see\", he said as he looked over his hostages before stopping in front of an elderly man that was well-dressed. \"You must be the manager.\" The manager shakily stood up. \"Yea…yes sir. I'm mist…miste… mister…\" \"Can it. The only words I want to hear come out of your mouth are the six digits that open that safe.\" \"Of course. Well, um, sir, the numbers are six, one, three, six…\" Hal shot a bullet at the ceiling, shutting the manager up immediately. He then pointed the gun at the manager's face and cocked it. \"Now let's hear the digits that don't set off the alarm.\" The manager froze for a second and then blurted out, \"sixseventhreesixeightseven\". Hal lowered the gun and smiled, putting his rough hand on the manager's shoulder. \"Now don't you feel better?\" The manager nodded. \"Thought so\". He turned to Jayne and yelled, \"You heard him! Now go get the money.\" Jayne said, \"Yeah boss,\" before running behind the teller's desks to the vault. He typed in the first three digits than stopped. Hal couldn't believe his ears when he heard Jayne yell, \"What were those last three numbers?\" \"You can't remember six fucking numbers?\" \"Hey! You know my math ain't too good!\" \"But it's only six numbers!\" \"That still don't change the fact that I don't remember them. So what are they?\" \"I don't remember! I thought you were supposed to remember!\" \"You fucking don't remember! Than why the hell are you makin' fun of me?\" \"I wasn't supposed to memorize the numbers, you were!\" \"Yeah but…\" \"Six eight seven\", Zoe said. \"What?\" Jayne asked. \"Those are the last three numbers, now stop arguing like twelve year olds and get the money.\" A few minutes later, Jayne walked up to the front, carrying four large bags. \"Let's go.\" As they walked out the door, Hal turned back and yelled, \"Anyone get off the floor before we are in the cruiser, we'll come back in here and shoot every one of you. You all understand.\" They nodded. He said, \"Alright. Have a lovely day\", before turning and walking out the door. Jayne and Zoe were putting the last bag of money in when he stepped out of the bank. He started to walk towards the cruiser when a bullet hit the wood right above his head. Hal dropped to the ground and let off two bullets towards the direction the shots came from. The bullets hit the shooter in the chest and he fell to the ground. Hal started to rise when the fallen body raised his arm and fired off two more shots. Hal dropped again and rolled for cover, shooting as he went. He made it behind a cart and reloaded his spent shells. Overhead he could hear Jayne's machine gun firing. He got up and ran to the cruiser, shooting as he went. There were now three men in the street. Two of them were taking cover behind buildings while the third one continued to advance, ignoring the machine gun fired aimed at him. He let off two rounds towards Jayne. One grazed his neck and the other barely missed his head as he ducked down. Hal shot another bullet at his attacker and jumped onto the cruiser, yelling, \"Let's go, let's go!\" as he fired off another shot. Inara spun the cruiser around and sped out of the town as Hal and Zoe let off another volley and Jayne threw a grenade at their attackers. The explosion sent dust flying through the air. As the dust settled, the gun man aimed and fired one more shot before putting his gun back in his holster. He carefully bent down and picked up his hat. He brushed the dust off of it before putting it back on his head and watching his quarry ride off out of sight. . . . Hal looked at Jayne. \"Why the hell did you bring a grenade?\" \"We needed it, didn't we?\" \"Guys\", Zoe said, \"I think we've got a problem.\" She lifted her hand to reveal a bullet hole through her left shoulder. \"Shit!\" Hal put his hands on the wound and pushed down on it. He checked her back to see it the bullet went all the way through. It didn't. \"Shit!\" He looked at Inara. \"Radio Simon. Tell him we got gunshot wounds and to tell River to get ready to take off. And tell him to hurry. Thirty minutes later, Serenity was out of the atmosphere and heading away from the moon they were just on. Simon was busy pulling the bullet out of Zoe's shoulder while Mal told them the story. He finally got a piece out, but it only looked like three quarters of the bullet. He gingerly reached into the wound with his hemostats as he dug around for the other piece of the bullet. He finally got a hold of the lead piece just as Mal was telling about their escape. \"…I jumped onto the ship, yelled 'let's go' and we shot off a couple of shots before Rambo here decided to throw a grenade. After the smoke cleared, they shot at as one more time and got Zoe.\" The lead bullet made a clinking sound as if fell to the bottom of the trashcan. \"Let me just bandage that up and you'll be good in another week or two.\" Hal squirted some hardening bandage into the wound and then put some bandages over it. \"So, why were they shooting? Do you think they were just lawmen or someone from the Alliance?\" Jayne said, \"Had to be the sheriff. Otherwise, they would still be chasing us.\" \"They still are.\" Everyone looked at River. \"They're following us.\" Irana said, \"There's no way. They didn't even come after us in the cruiser, and they could catch that hunk of junk in a few minutes.\" Hal sighed. \"River's right. They are following us.\" Silence filled the room. Simon finally broke the silence. \"How do you know?\" \"He was too good of a shot to be some small time sheriff. And if he was, he would have at least tried to chase us down and get the money back. So it can't be the sheriff. So that means he was either a bounty hunter or an Alliance Operative. Either way, they're coming for us.\"[Chapter 3] The Operative woke up on a cot in a small cell. There were no windows on the wall, only a small window on the door for the guards to look in every once in a while. He quietly searched his surroundings, analyzing every last detail. It was a bare concrete room with metal ceiling. From the ceiling, there was a florescent light and a small security camera to keep an eye on him. There seemed to be no key points he could break out at. The floor was concrete, so he couldn't dig. The walls were brick, but there was nothing for him to use to break through the brick with. So his only hope of escape would be through the door. He next decided to check the camera. It was a simple one, but it was able to turn and move to follow his movements, so disappearing from view and escaping through the door as they came to check on him was impossible. The metal was made of steel, so he could not break through it or bend it open if he took the camera out. He then checked the light. The metal case was welded to the ceiling, so there was no way of pulling the light out and climbing through the hole. Of course not, the Alliance isn't just going to let prisoners set to be executed escape. He checked under the bed and did a second sweep of the room before he sat on his cot to formulate a plan. His first idea he discarded due to the amount of security in the compound. The second plan he threw away due to lack of supplies. And the third plan would get him out of the room, but not out of the facility. He needed to get the guards in here, turn the camera off, change into the guard's uniform, and exit through the door to the hanger. He could only think of one plan that could possibly work. His brain went through the scenarios to figure out what to do if Plan A doesn't work. Finally, he was satisfied with his plan and began to put it in motion. Close to one in the morning, the Operative pulled the camera off the ceiling. This went unnoticed for almost half an hour before one of the guards noticed the screen was just white noise. The guards went down to the cell and armed themselves. They tried to turn on the light, but the light would not come on. Their training told them that the prisoner had possibly escaped and that they must go in and make sure he was gone, but another part of their training told them that this was something that a prisoner would plan to get a hostage. They peeped into the room and could not see anything. One of the guards shone a flashlight through the window, trying to find a sign of the Operative. But they could see nothing. They carefully opened the door and one by one, crept in. They looked up at the area that the light should have been and realized there looked to be a hole in the ceiling. It looked like a tight fit, but it seemed possible for a person to squeeze into it. The chief guard turned to order the guard outside to ring the alarm, but before he could speak, he froze in horror. The Operative was behind the other guard! Before the head guard could say anything, the Operative grabbed the guard outside and closed the door, locking the guards in. They could hear the grunts and screams of their companion outside, and the crunching of bones before the man's ceased to make a sound. The Operative smiled to himself as he put the dead guards' uniform on. The plan had worked perfectly. He knew he couldn't take the light off, but he could break through it and squeeze through the opening. It took him a total of 15 minutes to break through and squeeze his way into the duct. It took him another five minutes to crawl to the duct directly above the outside of his cell. He just had to wait for the guards to go in and he could make his escape. After the guards entered, he dropped down silently behind the last guard and quickly pulled him to the floor before closing the prison door. After he incapacitated the guard, he was ready to move out. He had been in the building before; through his years of working for the Alliance, he had several interrogations in this very building. He knew the floor plans and he knew where there was a ship. He calmly walked through the halls to the hanger of the prison. He was only stopped once, but a quick chop to the throat silenced him. He used the prisoner's ID to get through security to the hanger and got in the plane. The first sign the prison got that something was wrong was an unsanctioned ship leaving the prison, and by then, it was too late. The Operative was already out of the atmosphere and on his way to the outer planets.[Chapter 4] Hal sat down at the bar and ordered two drinks. As he waited for his beer, a bald man sat down next to him. He was a short man with pure white skin, like he never saw the sun in his life. His face was rough, filled with scars, including one that ran from his forehead, across his right eye, and down to his chin. That eye had a coat of white over it, while his other eye was red as hellfire. He lifted his hand and signaled for something to drink. The bartender nodded and handed him a glass of rum and vodka before handing Hal his drinks. \"Hello Hal.\" Hal took a gulp from his glass. \"Hello Richard. Did you stop by to talk business or buy me a drink?\" Richard laughed before waving the bartender over. \"Put this man's drinks on my tab\", he said before turning to Hal. \"Might as well buy you a drink if you got me what I wanted.\" \"Don't worry, I've got it.\" \"Good. So, where is it?\" \"It's safe. Now let's talk about my crew's and my fee.\" Richard nodded, his bald skull reflecting the dull yellow lights overhead. He turned around and got up. \"Follow me.\" Hal took a last gulp of his beer and followed him across the room. Richard pulled open a door and beckoned him in. Hal paused, wary of Richard. He never liked doing business in closed rooms alone. It gave leverage to whoever invited him into the room. He didn't have a gun, but if Richard had one, he might have a bit more of a bargaining tool. From the corner of his eye, he saw River tensing up, ready to strike. What the hell, he thought. I'm not going to be alone. If I need help, River's probably going to know about it before I do. He shook his head slightly to River, and she relaxed, her eyes still cautious. Hal walked through the door and someone closed it behind him. \"So\", Richard said from his seat as he motioned Hal to sit down. \"What percentage were you thinking?\" \"Well, I was thinking 100%, but I don't think that will do for you.\" Richard smiled. \"No, I don't think that will work.\" \"How about we split it 50-50?\" Richard started to laugh. \"Now look here, you're so called Intel did nothing to help us except to tell us where the bank was and how much was in it. You didn't get any password; you didn't get any information on how many people were guarding it. For all we knew, there could have been twelve guards instead of two. Plus we're taking all the risk.\" Richard frowned. \"Yes, I heard about the shooting.\" He paused and stood up. \"Alright, here is my final offer\". He leaned over the table. \"Nothing.\" \"What?\" Richard pulled a file out of his briefcase and tossed it over to Hal. Hal suspiciously looked at Richard before opening the file and pulling out its contents. It was seven posters, each one with a picture of his crew. At the bottom of each page, below the picture, there were different numbers for each person. But what caught his eye was his own figure. \"Congratulations Hal, you're worth 10 million dollars. That's a hard thing to do for a small time smuggler.\" \"When did you get this?\" \"Three days ago. As you can see, the Alliance is very desperate to find you. Anyone that finds you will be quite a rich man.\" He took a sip from his glass. \"Which brings me to my next point. The reason I brought you here was because someone wants to see you.\" He clicked a button and a door behind him opened. From the doorway came a cloaked figure, his face hidden from sight by the hood. Hal leaped up and charged Richard. Richard smashed his glass into Hals face before giving him a solid kick to the groin. Hal doubled over in pain. He looked up as Richard was about to kick him again when he heard a familiar voice. \"Stop.\" Richard paused, looking at his guest. He slowly lowered his foot. \"Sorry. So, now that you have him, where's my money.\" The guest's hand flew out like lightning, striking Richard in the side before twisting his hand. Richard froze, his face full of panic as he realized he had been tricked. The man removed his hood and smiled at Hal. \"Hello Hal\", the Operative said with a grin. Hal looked up with hatred at the Operative. \"So, you still want to bring me and my crew in.\" \"Not at all. I came to warn you.\" \"Warn me about what?\" He was about to speak when the door flew open. River stood there, staring at the two men as a drop of blood ran down her forehead. \"We need to go.\" The bar's patrons were scrambling as the Alliance soldiers stormed in. They open fired, shooting at anything that moved. They flipped over the tables as they searched the fallen bodies. River tossed Hal his gun as they hid in the room. The Operative removed his robe and motioned for the two of them to follow him before disappearing through the door he came from. River ran to the door only to be stopped by Hal. \"Hold on, are you sure he's safe?\" She looked behind her. \"He's safer than them\", nodding towards the soldiers. Hal looked back and forth at both doors. \"Good point.\" The narrow hallway seemed to go on forever. The only light was from the windows that ran along the hallway. They finally caught up to the Operative, who was starting up his ship in the hanger. \"Get in\", he yelled as the rockets ignited. The two jumped into the cargo bay of the small ship and sealed it shut as the ship left the hanger and headed away from the city. \"Where's your ship?\" Hal was about to yell up your ass when River quietly said, \"Head north.\" The Operative turned the ship and headed north. Finally, River pointed at a series of cliffs in the desert mountain and the Operative set the ship down at the edge of the cave. The bay door opened and Hal started to step off when a round of machine gun fire hit the ramp. Hal jumped back and yell, \"Whoa! Watch it!\" He looked around, trying to find the shooter when Jayne stepped out from behind a rock pile, his machine gun in his hands. \"What the hell was that!\" \"Sorry boss, but we saw the ship coming and we thought it might be Alliance or…\" He raised his gun again and pointed it at the Operative as he stepped off. \"What the hell is he doing here?\" \"He gave us a lift.\"[Chapter 5] Jayne kept his hand rested on his pistol as he watched the Operative eat. He ignored Jayne as he finished his stew. He wiped his mouth with and napkin and carefully folded it and placed it on the table. He stood up. Jayne pulled the gun out of his holster and pointed it at him. The Operative smiled. \"Will you put that up before someone gets hurt?\" \"The only one who will get hurt is you.\" The Operative looked down at the gun and then back up at Jayne. He started to laugh. Jayne's face filled with surprise. \"What's so funny?\" \"You are my friend.\" Quickly, his hand shot out and took the gun. His other hand grabbed Jayne's arm and twisted it. Jayne spun around and fell on the table, with the Operative over top of him as he pushed the arm up more, immobilizing him. The Operative unloaded the gun swiftly with his free hand and he threw it down on the ground. He put his head next to Jayne's and he softly spoke. \"Never threaten me again.\" He stood up and kept his grip on Jayne. \"You can put the gun down Captain.\" Hal walked through the door, his revolver aimed at the back of the Operative's head as he crept closer. \"Let him go.\" \"As you wish.\" He released his grip from Jayne and he turned around and began to walk out of the dining room. Jayne quickly stood up and charged the Operative. The Operative nimbly moved out of the way and as Jayne passed him, he thrust his arm into Jayne's side and pushed on the nerve. Jayne fell to the floor, trembling as he tried to move his limbs. The Operative turned to Hal. \"You should teach your man to learn when he has lost.\" He disappeared down the corridor. Hal walked over to Jayne and flipped him over. Jayne groaned. \"Son of a bitch.\" \"Well you were asking for it.' \"I didn't know he'd paralyze me.\" \"You learn your lesson?\" He sighed. \"Yeah.\" Hal stood up. \"Hal, do you really trust this guy?\" Hal looked down at Jayne and then stared down the corridor that the Operative disappeared down and then followed him. Jayne lay on the ground struggling against his own body as he tried to move. \"What about me,\" he yelled down the hall. . . . The crew carefully eyed the Operative. He coolly looked back at each of them in turn, his gaze hesitating at River. He smiled at her and looked at Hal. \"So she's going to be your lie detector.\" Hal nodded. \"Very well. Since everyone is here, I'll go ahead and start. After you all revealed the Alliance's affairs on Miranda, they realized you are their top priority.\" \"Why?\" Kaylee interrupted. \"What we did is done. We can't do anything else.\" \"River here is the reason. They believe she has other secrets about the Alliance. Things worse than Miranda.\" \"What could be worse than Miranda?\" \"I don't know, but I think River knows. Perhaps not consciously, but she knows about other workings of the Alliance. They've realized that they need to give you nowhere to run. That's why the bounty is so high, and eventually, I'm sure they will make it dead or alive.\" Hal said \"Is that it? We could have found that out from anyone.\" The Operative frowned. \"There is more. They've realized they need more to be certain you will be caught. They've called Charles Dante.\" A deathly silence filled the room. The crew stared at the Operative with this news. Simon looked at their faces, puzzled. \"Who's Charles Dante?\" Hal looked at him. \"He's a bounty hunter.\" \"I don't see the big deal. We've dealt with bounty hunters before.\" \"Not like this one.\" \"Charles Dante is also a Reaver hunter\", Jayne said. \"He's the only thing they are afraid of. He likes to torture them after he catches them. I heard he likes to cut their limbs off and disembowel them before scalping them and burning them alive.\" \"How do you know?\" Hal asked. \"I used to work with a guy that did a few jobs on one of Dante's trips into Reaver territory. He said the guy loved to watch them suffer.\" The Operative interrupted. \"He's also one of the best trackers there are. He's probably on his way to find you right now.\" \"He already found us.\" The Operative looked at Hal. \"He almost got us on a job on Deadmoon. Is there anything we can do?\" The Operative shook his head. \"Either keep running, kill him, or die.\"[Chapter 6] The Reaver teeth clicked together around his neck as he walked through the galley ways towards the bridge. His leather boots clicked against the metal as he walked and the pistol at his hip silently thumped against his thigh. As he walked, he had a slight limp, almost imperceptible after years of hiding it. But still, it was there. Given to him by a Reaver, painted completely white. His oldest adversary. At the time, he thought it was strange to see a Reaver decorate himself as such, but after years of hearing all the descriptions of his elusive foe, he realized it was so the blood was that much more visible, the fear that much more palpable. Dante climbed the stairs and stood at the helm of his ship, putting his hand on his pilot's shoulder. The pilot, Jim Bradshaw, was a bright young man, with dark brown hair and pale skin. Dante had hired him almost immediately out of flight school. Of course, he didn't have to offer much to get him. Dante had done his research. Jim's parents were killed in a Reaver raid. He only survived by hiding beneath the bed his mother was ravaged upon. As soon as he heard the name of his employer, Jim was on board. There were twelve of them. Most were mercenaries, people Dante hired specifically to help with his crusade against the Reaver hoards. The only civilians were Jim and Ronda, the mechanic. Of course, they couldn't be called civilians. Not after the things they've seen, the things they've done. Dante tapped Jim on the shoulder and Jim looked up. \"How's it going Son?\" \"Fine sir. Can't sleep.\" \"No, I just wanted to walk around a bit.\" Dante carefully rubbed his chest, still sore after the rounds Mal had fired into his bullet proof armor. He knew the dull pressure would be there for another week before it faded away completely. But it still hurt like hell. Jim watched him massage the bruise. \"Have you gone to see Peter?\" \"What the hell do I need a medic for? I ain't bleeding, I ain't dying. There ain't nothing he can do for me anyhow. Just got to wait it out. Wait it out.\" \"Yessir.\" \"How's the old girl?\" \"The ship's fine sir. A few holes on the port wing, but nothing worth fretting about. She's got another month in her before we need any repairs.\" \"Good, good.\" He continued to nod as he looked out into the deep darkness of space. Most people couldn't look very far into the heart of that darkness, focusing on the stars or whatever substance was there in that vastness, but the void was what Dante looked upon. He looked upon it as a thing of beauty. He stared into the gulf of emptiness while Jim remained quiet, staring down at his console and occasionally looking up at the stars. Dante didn't look away as he spoke. \"Why don't you go on to bed?\" \"I'm fine sir.\" \"Let me rephrase that. Go to bed son. That's an order.\" Jim nodded and after pressing a few buttons to maintain the Meridian's course, he stood up and saluted. \"I wish you'd stop doing that son.\" \"I'm sorry sir. Force of habit.\" \"Well, I can't blame a man for habits that ain't bad. Go and get some rest.\" Jim nodded and marched down the hall towards his bunk. Dante turned to watch him. He'll never get the military out of him, he thought. It's in his blood, in his soul. And once something's in a man's soul, it's harder than hell to get it out. He looked over the ship's console and saw everything was stable, so he turned to his maps. Most ships had a basic Galactic Guidance Drive, but he'd always preferred his old fashion, paper maps. He would spend hours poring over every detail, marking his positions and that of his prey. He knew where the Reavers stayed. He just wandered along the outlying planets, straddling the border between their territory and his. He hid from them until they came down on an Rim world, and then he would swoop down and wipe them out, but not before demanding a handsome price for his services. But always, in the bodies of each of the corpses, he searched for the one he most desire. The Pale Reaver. As he looked at the maps, his finger wandered over the places he marked Reaver territory. He ran his finger along the line Mal had taken to Miranda, whistling in admiration. Dante only wished he had men with the courage and stupidity to do what Mal had done. It was a pity the man was his quarry. He flipped through several maps until he came on the one where his prey had been last spotted. His source, Richard, had responded to his call and told how they had been there to pick up some money and had fled towards the Rim planets. He looked over the map, studying it, as he anticipated his prey's next move. He ran his finger over the map and stopped at a small, recently terraformed planet. Anthrila. That was where his prey would be. On the icy world of Anthrila. And the Meridian would be there soon. \"A day or two,\" he whispered to himself. \"Just a day or two.\"[Chapter 7] Jayne sat at the kitchen table, spinning his knife like a top on the wooden surface. He stared across at the Operative and River, who were noisily eating their soup. The two continued to talk, with River laughing every once in a while to some quip from the Operative. When he spoke, he spoke softly and she stared at him as though he were the only one in the world. In the middle of a sentence, she suddenly yelled out, \"Last one to finish their soup is a feh feh pi goh!\" She began furiously gulping down the soup and the Operative quickly joined her, though she finished first, giving a celebratory whoop. The Operative and River laughed while Jayne continued to glare at the Operative. Suddenly, River perked up and became serious. Without a word, she rose and ran out of the room and down the corridor, her combat boots echoing through the halls. The Operative looked at Jayne and smiled, but Jayne remained still, twirling his knife with his fingers, glaring at the man he had to break bread with. The Operative lifted the bowl to his lips and greedily drank the remainder of the soup and set it down gently. He looked across at Jayne and then looked down at the knife. \"Perhaps you should stop playing with your knife.\" \"Perhaps you should shut up.\" \"If you're trying to intimidate me, you should stop.\" \"Why? Because you're intimidated?\" \"Because you're drilling holes into the table.\" Jayne looked down at the hole he created. Momentarily taken back, he looked up and dumbly retorted, \"So.\" The Operative shrugged. \"Suit yourself.\" The Operative slowly laid his palms flat on the table and slowly began to tap his fingers on the polished wood. They stared at each other, Jayne glaring while the Operative looked at his adversary with a bemused look. All the while, Jayne spun the blade deeper and deeper into the table. They sat there for a long while before the Operative spoke. \"Are you going to say anything or just bore a hole through the table?\" \"Just because Mal trusts you, don't mean that I do.\" \"Clearly. But is that any reason to destroy a fine table.\" Jayne leaned forward and pushed the knife in even harder, twisting it faster. \"I ain't done. I know you've got something you ain't telling us, so you spit it out now or I'll beat your…\" \"HEY!\" Jayne turned around to see Mal standing in the doorway, his face one of astonishment. \"What the hell are you doing to my table?\" Jayne dumbly looked down at the table. The hole had grown and was now almost a quarter inch wide and twice as deep. He tried to come up with an excuse, but all that came out was, \"He made me do it.\" Mal motioned to the door. \"Get out of here.\" Jayne took the invitation, glaring at the Operative as he rose, and walked out of the dining room. Mal watched him leave and called out after him, \"And don't think you're not paying for the table.\" He turned to the Operative who smiled. \"I never realized he was such a poetic character.\" \"That's about as poetic as he gets.\" He sat down. \"I've noticed you've become quite familiar with River.\" \"She's a nice girl.\" \"You know she has a brother.\" \"Yes.\" \"On this ship.\" \"Yes.\" \"So, you know…\" He spun his hands in the air while the Operative looked at him confused. \"No, I don't know.\" \"Let me put this plainly. Don't touch her.\" \"The thought never crossed my mind. Why? Has it crossed yours?\" Mal opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. He closed his eyes and brushed back his brown hair and then looked back at the Operative. \"I don't know why River trusts you. I don't trust you. Jayne doesn't trust you. As far as I know, the only person on this ship that trusts you is River and I don't want you taking advantage of a helpless… well, not exactly helpless, but you get what I'm saying.\" \"I understand. So, where are we going.\" \"Anthrila. There's a guy who can do some repairs for Serenity before we start running. I'd suggest you buckle up. It's going to be an interesting landing.\" ","Summary":" The Operative stood before the council, his hands and feet bound to the chair as his eyes carefully"},{"Movie":"Starship Troopers","Title":"Starship Troopers 2:  Crack in the System","Author":"Gandalf the Beige","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2486961","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Starship Troopers: Crack in the System Disclaimer: I do not own the movie Starship Troopers… and I don't want to own it, rights nor a copy. The plot was shaky, the acting wooden and the premise utter shite. But it got me to think: how did a bunch of militaristic meatheads like the 'veterans' gain control of the entire planet, and why are there hoards of large insects on a planet apparently devoid of life? This is my theory, I hope you like it. Late 23rd Century, Klendathu The tunnels were dark. That could be seen as the natural order of things, lack of sunlight and all. Giant insectoid warriors meandered in rough file through the larger halls while small workers crawled through tight tunnels tending to the workings of the hive. Having gotten this far, a member of the mobile infantry would be most likely being taken to a brain bug to have his brain sucked out or be dead, food for the warriors. Going further into the tunnels, a friendly would begin to find things not typical of an insect colony. First off, there were strings of lighting fixtures running along tunnels with level floors, fixtures that looked strangely mechanical. Secondly were the humanoids rushing through these corridors carrying racks of small serum vials, each filled with genetic material for creating ever stronger and faster assault insects than the last batch did. These were the Klendathi, a people who had once basked in the wealth and splendour of being the sovereigns of 5000 worlds, and a population of over ten trillion citizens. They had also had strong ties with Earth, back when its strong democratic tradition was still upheld by all people of eligible age. The main reason they were here, however, was not to invade anyone. This planet had once been their home, a world of lush plant and animal life with myriad diversity… before the Big Boil, a thermal cascade that had scorched everything down to the bedrock and had boiled the entire water table. Terraforming and repopulation were the order of the day, but someone always had to crash the party: in this case Earths new regime. They had caused the Big Boil, and had recently fielded hundreds of thousands of poorly equipped troops onto the planets surface to meet the insectoid defenders of the colonies in open war… an incredibly one sided conflict if there ever was one. The point was that these humans were clearly not the individualistic bull-headed free spirits that the Klendathi had learned to love in their 120-year relationship. They had become almost as mindless and quick to fight as the insects their former allies genetically engineered. And much deeper in, two surgeons had just cracked the code of this strange behaviour. \"Well I'll be damned. The Colonel was right!\" Said the middle-aged female as she beheld what lay in the surgical tray. It appeared to be a small square of silicon and not much else. \"This explains how they were able to break the sprits of all the men and women that they're throwing to the insectoid masses. What about her?\" The male, apparently in his mid twenties, motioned his head to indicate the female human with the shaved head and surgical scar along the side of her head who was unconscious in the surgical chair. \"The colonel said he wants to get her on the up and up once she's awake. After that… well, its up to her really.\" The female replied as she updated the patients' chart. \"Why did he insist on faking this ones death? She doesn't seem very spectacular.\" \"He said something about her having 'spirit' or something. I think he watched too many DreamWorks ™ films as a kid… not a bad thing though.\" He added hurridly. And if the observer had been able to read Klendathi, he would have noticed the name of the patient: Drina \"Dizzy\" Flores. Drina in Spanish means \"Helper and Defender of mankind\" so it makes sense… sort of.[Chapter 2] Starship Troopers 2: Crack in the System Chapter 2 Disclaimer: I do not own the franchise… movie was crap and I never read the book (have heard the general premise, think the earning-the-vote thing goes too far and don't like that particular books apparent slant). Just to give you a clue though, the chip in Dizzies head was… disabled very early on, so the whole \"trust the State' thing never really set in so well. Couple that with family stories hostile toward sanctioned history and the government never really had a chance. And yes , I know Heinleins motivations, and the differences between the versions. (I mean… who wouldn't enjoy Geonosian/ Verpine equivalents battling soldiers in really tiny mechs? Really good concept… didn't like the societal concept much though) That's why the society is referred to later on as \"Heinlein on speed, blow and… possibly smack, although we aren't 100 sure.\" This fanfiction is based on the movie version, and tells how it could have come about. Although the Heinlein meritocracy is palatable on certain occasions and in small doses: such the Klendathi governing councils. Meaning that everyone of age can vote on issues, but you have to have done something (economic, agriculture, military or, in the case of the general assemblies, take an advanced University Civics course) to even have a chance to get voted onto those councils. Hope you like. 2 months later, Ticonderoga Fleet Battle station It began with a finger flipping a switch deep in the Stations janitorial recesses. Dreams were common enough in the sleeping heads of Mobile Infantry grunts. Their three main themes were 1) anger, 2) blood, and finally 3) the overwhelming feeling that the government was looking out for you despite all evidence to the contrary. The last one was especially useful when you, for instance, had just found out that your childhood friend, brilliant and psychic, was treating you as nothing but a number after taking up psychopathy as a hobby in the Games & Theory Dept. It helped to numb the pain of betrayal. But it could also be said that in the sleeping head of one Lieutenant \"Johnnie\" Juan Delmont Rico, things were forming that had not appeared in the head of an earth soldier for generations. One odd thing was the distinct lack of the colour red. In its place were various shades of green. This was because in his dream, Rico was patrolling not the windswept dustpans of Klendathu, but a lush hardwood forest high on a hillside, overlooking a wide river valley and green plain. It wasn't on Earth either, because very few hardwood shrubs back home had hexagonal leaves. It was probably some far off alien world where PanGalatic Lumber, Petroleum and Useless Novelty would probably be setting up shop soon. Shame really… Then, beyond all explanation, he heard it . \"Johnny….\" But there wasn't anyone around, was there? On a hunch he began walking toward an elm-like tree that had a hollow at eye- height. \"Johnny...\" It came again. The voice was becoming clearer, more familiar, more feminine… it couldn't be… could it? Nearing the hollow, the sound of chattering exoskeleton began emanating, a sound he had learned to fear on the sands, but in dreamy woodland, it instead invoked wonderment. He peered inside… and a shiny red, black and yellow beetle, with a body the size of a walnut but legs spanning eight inches, sprang out and forced him back. It was creepy; it was chattering, it was… strangely familiar. BLLLLLAAAAAAARRRRRMMM It was then that he was woken; the P.A. sounding out like a chorus of brazen throated trumpets. From the speakers in the barracks they rang, and again from the concourse and the hall, echoing from every room and corner over and over again. Another day had come for the Mobile Infantry, or, as some had dubbed them: \"bug fodder\". But did it have to be at 5 AM? They showered, dressed were in the briefing room by 530 hours. Apparently, even though they'd gotten flashy new armaments, vivisected a brain bug and blown more holes in the sand than ever before, they were still losing ground. What else, some of the fatalities were coming back with unidentified wounds, wounds that could never have been caused by any of the known Bug phenotypes… and then there were those who weren't coming back at all, not even in bits. The mission would be for three squads to advance down a canyon, securing the route for a detonation team to take out a seemingly unguarded plasma bug position. The officers were privately celebrating that the bugs would leave such an obvious crack in their defences, taking it as a sign that the brain-bug capture was finally paying off. The rest were saying it was just another trap. As it turned out, the rest were right. 18 hours later, Central Canyon lands, Klendathu. The sounds of weapons fire and screams ripped into the night. Hoppers launched themselves from the tops of the canyon walls to decapitate members of Alpha and Beta Squads while a wave of Warriors surged against hails of laser fire to shred human flesh. All in all, it was just another night on Klendathu. Or maybe it wasn't. The only people not getting attacked were what now constituted Rico's Roughnecks. They were firing madly into the ranks of warrior bugs and at the cliff tops, while simultaneously backing into a box canyon, closed save for a slope of loose gravel to their left. It was supposed to lead right into an artillery position. There was another strange thing: Rico was a known target to the bugs. Why wouldn't they go after him? The answer was looking down at him through a spotting scope from the top of the gravel inclination. The figure was wearing a reddish brown cloak and hood, and was mounted upon a rather dark, non-descript horse with about a dozen other similarly clad persons in the darkness. The lead figure, the one wearing a dirty, ragged, brown, wide-brimmed hat instead of a hood, exhaled smoke from a cigarette butt, its red glow illuminating an inhuman face, before turning to the first figure. \"This the one?\" \"Positive… Sir.\" Said the first figure, putting the scope away. The hat wearer then proceeded to crush out his cigarette on the palm of his thick leather glove before tossing it aside and pulling out some sort of remote signalling device. At the touch of a button the Arachnids suddenly stopped committing carnage, much to the Roughnecks astonishment. Even more astonishing, they began retreating, though not before rendering the other two squads to utter hamburger. Then the lead rider pulled something out of a saddle holster. It was a clunky, modular construction consisting of a wide, stocky barrel, a pistol grip and a folding stock with some complicated looking canisters and stuff in-between. Out of a saddlebag he produced a small, spherical device, on which he slid a panel into a certain position, making segments on it blink green. Said device was then inserted into the aforementioned barrel, from whence it was subsequently launched from with the thump of pressurized gas. It landed in the midst of the confused squad, who only comprehended it for about a second and a half before it exploded into an expanding ring of green fluorescence, causing the Mobile Infantry to collapse into an unconscious state. Non-injurious Stun grenades… what would they think of next? 10 minutes later, the riders, the unconscious roughnecks and the bugs had deserted the scene, leaving nothing but debris, bodies… and a crushed lump of paper and tobacco that some sharp-eyed deputy coroner would notice in the disturbed gravel on the top of the slope and get a propaganda-infected mind to wander. They always said that the Colonels habit would lead to trouble. 5 days later, secret location The first thing Juan Rico saw when he awoke from a drug-induced stupor was the face of the doctor standing over him at his bedside. Two things were striking about this doctor was immediately apparent. One: the doctor was a woman and two: she wasn't human. She had skin the colour of honey, with green squiggles appearing from just below the hairline up toward the crown of the scalp. A slim, slightly flattened nose with demure nostrils was positioned inside a face whose cheeks were high and thin, and had a thin, pointed chin. Actually, outside of the corrective goggles she wore over her eyes (the nose was too flat to support conventional spectacles), her greying brown hair being pulled into a severe bun and her having an 'it's all business' look on her face, she could have been a real looker. \"Ah, Mr. Rico. Forgive me for stating the obvious, but you're awake.\" She commented with a rather clinical detachment before heading away to another bed. Jerking fully awake, Rico found his wrists bound by shackles, and secured by metal cord to the cot-frame. \"Just a precaution: the guards insisted.\" The doctor said, even though she hadn't turned from checking an intravenous tube at the other bed. From what he could see of the figure on the bed, Rico could recognize it as Mani, a corporal from his squad. \"Is he alright?\" Rico had absolutely no idea where he was or what this species was. Was he a prisoner, was he rescued? Even though there was a vase of strange flowers at a bedside table, this did nothing for his nerves. \"His body is fine… it's his brain that got fried.\" She turned back to Juan. \"No need to worry; we don't shoot our disabled. And it isn't as if he's a vegetable. He can still see and hear. Mr. Mani is actually the luckiest out of the three: he still has some use in his fingers and his diaphragm wasn't affected. His speech and motion centres got the brunt of the shock.\" \"Shock from what? What happened to us?\" This was getting frightening. Strange environment, strange species and strange injuries did not put a persons mind at ease. \"1500 volts through the Frontal Lobe.\" Said the doctor. A commotion coming from beyond the door drew her attention. \"I'll be one minute.\" She proceeded to stride toward the door, open it and tell the corporal outside to keep the noise down. But then she turned back toward him. \"It seems to your lucky day, Mr. Rico: You have a visitor\". She held the door open… and in stepped the absolutely last person he had ever expected to see again. \"Hey Johnny.\" Said the very attractive, very athletic and very alive Drina Flores as she got to his bedside. Her hair was short (1) and a scar was barely visible on the scalp beneath. Johnny, overcome by this obvious shift in the alive/dead duality, could only produce what sounded like a balloon leaking air. \"Is something wrong?\" Dizzy asked innocently, as the doctor watched to see if more sedative was needed. \"You're dead . I saw you die !\" Rico managed to breathe out. It wasn't much, but it gave some insight into his current mental state. \"Correction:\" Began Dizzy, actually looking amused at this. \"You saw something that looked like me die. These people are geniuses when it comes to genetics! The thing you saw was… a duplicate, a robot frame sheathed in cloned tissue and run by an intricate computer brain. She only existed to die and leave a beautiful corpse. And thus, I'm here.\" But how are you here? In the first place, I mean.\" Asked Juan, a bit more coherent. \"Well… do you remember George, the janitor on the Ticonderoga?\" \"Yeah. Isn't he the one constantly griping about when his 'grandpappy' had the vote? The old man?\" This was getting interesting. How could an old codger like George Smith be involved in this? \"That's him, and his son of course, Jacob. Well… they're spies : infiltrators belonging to the League of Earth Ex-patriots, humans living beyond the Spiral Divide. It's actually really interesting how it happened.\" \"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Humans beyond the Spiral Divide? We don't have any colonies out there; our range barely even reaches Arkell. Besides, that's wilderness!\" Confusion was becoming a definite theme in this conversation. \"Oh, they're not colonies… not official Earth-sponsored colonies anyway.\" Came a new voice, from the corner behind Rico. Juan turned his head, and saw a figure lounging on a chair, wearing a tattered poncho, his face hidden by the brim of his hat. \"And, contrary to what you've been told, the space beyond the divide is very civilized: Over one hundred thousand worlds, thousands of intelligent species, hundreds of governments and confederations… and not a single division between them.\" The apparition rose from the chair and removed his hat. His face (underneath the light brown hair of a badly overgrown crew-cut) was that of the smoking horseman, a more rugged, wider, essentially male version of the good doctor, his skin being darker by several degrees than that of the female, perhaps signifying a tan. His nose was much broader than the doctors though just as flat and the squiggles on his scalp were a faded grey instead of bright green. His seven-foot frame was slightly long in the limb and muscular, giving the impression of someone who had lived most of his life outdoors. And the look on his face… was a combination of amusement, curiosity and a little confusion. \"What's your name, soldier?\" At first stunned into silence, Rico stuttered out, with Dizzy nudging him, \"Rico… Juan Rico, Buenos Aries. Lieutenant in the Mobile Infantry… sir.\" 'You have a good eye for brass, boy.\" The figure held out his hand. \"Col. Markenta Slensu. And do not even think of laughing; once upon a time we would have thought names like Rico, Flores and Zim were the pinnacle in knee-slapping humour.\" Mentioning Zim was his first mistake. \"Wait… Zim? He's still alive? Where is he?\" Questions began filling his head again after being momentarily stunned by the Colonels appearance. Dizzie sighed. \"Johnnie… I wanted to… explain it to you gradually, but you have to know. You and Zim are, technically, prisoners.\" She interrupted him in advance of his inevitable outburst. \"I was too! But after they showed me the stuff they have on file, I joined them. And the surgery was top notch, didn't feel a thing on the rebound.\" \"Surgery? What the hell did they do to us?!\" Rico had risen to the level of the frantic, which, considering what he had just heard, made sense. \"Excuse me, but I think that the patient has had enough excitement for today.\" Came the voice of the doctor. After the two people had left, the doctor went to the patients' bedside and sat on a vacated chair. \"Mr. Rico. Before I inform you of the fate of your comrades, I must ask you: do you know of anything your government has ever implanted into your body?\" Rico had never really thought about this, but tried remembering through the traces of drug-fog. \"Well… when we're babies we get a tracking chip implanted deep in the brain. It's to help locate kidnap victims… part of the whole J.E.E.P. program: Justice that is Efficient, Effective and Punctual or so they call it\". Juan felt a little silly talking about a program aimed at child safety. \"But, here's the question:\" the doctor asked, \"Why would they implant the device in that specific spot? Why not into the thoracic…\" she noticed the patients incomprehension \"chest cavity? Or into one of the long bones or deep in the intestine?\" \"Well…\" pondered Juan, thinking more deeply than he had ever done before. \"In the brain… it would be harder for non-medical kidnappers to remove it without lasting harm, therefore decreasing the victims ransom value.\" He paused. \"Did I just say all that?\" The doctor let a smile crack through her frigid façade. \"Indeed you did. And, if I may say so, your critical thinking skills are quite nice. Are you sure you didn't read that somewhere?\" \"Nope. They always elaborated on why they put it in, but never the reason for where .\" Juan was beginning to get an inkling of something that her had never gotten before: an actual curiosity of what those devices were actually for. And it frightened him. \"What are you implying?\" He asked slowly. \"Just that your government might have had motives other than public safety in mind when it implanted those devices. That we have found that said devices… do other things than merely emit a homing signal.\" The doctor hesitated before continuing. \"After we extracted the device from Ms. Flores' frontal lobe through traditional invasive surgery, we learned from her that they were implanted through the use of medical micro-borer tubules (2). Since we employ a similar device for extracting biopsies, we thought that removal would be quick for all involved.\" She sighed. \"We were wrong. On the first five members of your squadron, we accidentally triggered a self-destruct mechanism in the chip, killing them with varying degrees of violence. One of our better surgeons received facial injuries from the first explosion.\" The doctor got up. \"After careful thought, we surrounded the remaining 5 subjects in a makeshift Electromagnetic field to effectively smother the explosive. It was there that we found that the devices possessed an apparent second countermeasure: a micro-shock generator, seemingly installed to damage the subjects' brain tissue in case of infiltration. That's is what happened to Mr. Mani here, along with two others, one of whom doesn't have complete diaphragm control anymore.\" \"Wait a minute: you said five died and three wound up like this. If I'm Number 10… then who was number 9?\" Asked Johnnie. \"Your 'sadistic mutha' of a drill sergeant, as per Ms. Flores and Private Jeru. As soon as you are up and ready, I suggest you and Drina take a trip down to the stockade to see Mr. Zim.\" She went back to a corner desk and began filling out forms. \"Why's he there? And since I'm a prisoner too, why aren't I there?\" His brain was becoming clearer than it had ever been. \"Because, Mr. Rico…\" The Chief Surgeon of Canyon Colony said as she looked up from her work. \"You haven't tried biting my fingers off yet.\" Footnotes 1.

I'm surprised there isn't more fanfiction considering all of the possibilities that the movie gave! So this is my story, please enjoy. I'm hoping more will come so review and give me ideas if you have the time :) The five students stood in the cellar, observing the strange collection of toys they'd found. Marty ran the reels of camera footage through his fingers, straining his eyes to see the small sepia images in the dim light. Unable to make out the figures- unsure if it was the lighting, or the seemingly heavy effect he was getting from the joint he'd been smoking only moments ago, Marty sought out a projector to view the reels on. Dana ran her fingers lightly over the white painted masks that lay in a pile on the side of the room as she made her way over to a dust covered vanity. In the background she could faintly hear the sound of a music box playing in the background. Dana's fingers traced across the old, time worn leather book placed carefully on the vanity, her fingers picking up dust. Opening the book she discovered a hand-written journal that must have belonged to a young girl, from the way the writing looked. Holden had found a small, white music box decorated plainly. The simplicity of the object reminded him of something his grandmother had used to own. Running his fingers along the bottom of the box, he found the knob and began winding it up. Upon opening it, a familiar tune began to play- something that reminded him of his childhood. Could it be? Was this the same music box his grandmother had once owned? The small ballerina girl twirled away in front of Holden's eyes. Curt picked up a large conch shell, nearly the size of his head, putting his lips towards the small opening on the end of it. Memories from his childhood, swimming by the ocean with his dad came back to him. His eyes gazed around the room, looking past Holden who seemed mesmerized by the minuscule ballerina twirling in her music box. Spotting a large golden ball, he set down the conch shell. Curt walked towards it, picking the sphere up to find it very similar to a Rubik's Cube. His hands began to twirl the rotating layers around, attempting to match some of the markings up on the sides. Jules ran her hands over a silk shawl, picking it up and shaking it off, dust flying. Coughing, she set the fabric down again and grabbing the bundled up twigs in the jar behind the shawl. Wondering what kind of wood they were she examined the twigs closely, unable to identify them. Frustrated, she set the twigs down. That's when she saw it. A mannequin stood in the corner of the room, robed in the most beautiful dress Jules had ever seen. She gasped for a moment as she took in the gown. The white lace with sparkling jewels decorating the bodice of the dress would have given away its purpose as a wedding gown if it hadn't been for the veil that fell down the back of the mannequin. She pulled back the smooth white veil to reveal a very large, very blue jeweled necklace. Something old, something new, something borrowed something blue.\" The old rhyme rang through Jules's head as she removed the necklace from the mannequin. It seemed lighter than it should have been, and in the dim light from Marty's lamp, the necklace changed colors she began putting her around her neck. Every person in the room jumped as a loud bang resonated through the cellar, followed by a blinding flash of light. The flicker of a tape could be heard as Marty stumbled away from the projector he'd found. A family moved around on the screen behind him, two children playing on a swing set. A teenage boy sat at the side of the sepia screen reading. \"What the hell Marty? Are you trying to give us all heart attacks?\" Curt walked over to the projector and began to watch the film. Marty stood beside him as Dana and Jules placed their items back where'd they'd found them, unsure of what had attracted them at first. Dana had found the journal disturbing in the first place, and Jules found the necklace to be rather unattractive at second glance, she realized as she ducked under Curt's arm. Holden closed the music box before the final, familiar chords rang out and joined the others, mindful of the fact that Dana stood in front of him. \"Come on Victor, put that silly camera away!\" A beautiful woman appeared on the screen, giving the camera person, apparently named Victor, a stern look. \"Sophia, how else are we supposed to document such a lovely summer day? And a special one at that! It's our Kevin's 18th birthday, he's a man now!\" The boy off to the side looked up quickly as his name was said. Smiling slightly he put down his book and stood up. \"Well he's quite attractive for an old man.\" Jules joked as Curt leaned down and nibbled on her neck. \"I mean, for someone who lived when they dressed like that, he's cute. Right Dana?\" She looked to her friend for support. Dana nodded slightly. She had a bad feeling about this. There was something off about Kevin's smile. The things she'd read in that diary had put her on edge. There was no way she was sleeping tonight. \"Kevin! Why don't you open up your first present for the camera.\" The woman's voice interrupted Dana's thought process and made her jump. Marty, who was standing next to her glanced over suspiciously. \"Something wrong Dana? Can you feel it to?\" He whispered to Dana who shook her head. Dismissing Marty's 'feeling' as a side effect of the pot, she brought her gaze back up to the screen. Kevin had been sat in front of the camera which had been placed on something as it continued to film. Victor had joined Sophia and Kevin along with the two children, a boy and a girl, and the group was sitting on the grass in front of the swing set, a large box in front of them. Kevin smiled at the box, slowly peeling the paper covering away. The screen flickered slightly as the scene changed. The location stayed the same but something was different. Dana gasped and Marty's hand found hers. Jules let out a small scream as she saw the change. Four of the five family members lay limply on the ground surrounding the opened present box. Victor, the father, stirred and tried to get up but a quick blur of black slammed into him and he collapsed onto the ground once more. The blur was Kevin, who picked up his father by his feet and started dragging him towards the camera, a small grin on his face. The most disturbing part of it all? Kevin looked happy as he did it. Reaching into his pocket, the boy on the screen pulled out a knife, dropping his father's feet and repositioning himself at his head. Dana looked away as the boy grabbed his father's hair. A cry from both behind her, and from the screen assured her that she'd been right not to look. Screams of pain floated from the movie as member after member of the family shared the same fate as their father. Burying herself in Holden's shirt, she shielded herself from the horrific images on screen. Marty let go of her hand after a final squeeze and a few moments later the sound of screams subsided. The five of them turned once more to the blank screen as if trying to figure out if what they'd seen was real. Glancing around at each other's pale expressions confirmed the reality of the situation. All of them had just shared an experience they'd never thought they would. The light flickered on again and before Marty could stop it again, the image of Kevin tossing his younger sister's head at the screen with that calm smile on his face was burned into their minds. For what seemed like an eternity, there was silence in the cellar. \"Why don't we go upstairs? I'll get us some beer and we can continue our game of truth or dare?\" Curt tried to lighten the mood unsuccessfully. They all did decide to go upstairs though, attempting to escape the dark mood that had fallen on them. Somewhere far in the distance, a young man dressed in black, sat perched in the high branch of a tree, staring up at the nearly empty night sky. The summer wind blew around him, stirring the trees but he wasn't afraid. The moonlight reflected in his glasses. Finally. He'd been cooped up for so long, watching as the others got their turn year after year. No one ever chose the films. Not when there were more interesting items available. He'd enjoyed making them though. For too long his parents had underestimated him. Then giving him that for his birthday. It had been as if they were mocking him. No one was mocking him now. His brother and sister of course, he'd been doing them a favour. Watching your mother and father being dismembered- that wasn't something a child should have to live with. He nimbly climbed down from his perch, whistling as he made his way back down to the ground. Picking up his knives from the ground, he made sure they all shined in the light of the moon. All five of the knives- one for each target. He didn't need anything else. His knives were part of him- an extension of his arm. Packed up on his belt he began to walk towards the cabin. He'd make his Masters proud. Now it was his time to shine again. Show the world he wasn't the weak, good for nothing they thought he was. His name would invoke terror in all that heard it, their dying words, ringing out in the darkness. Kevin... Ronald the Intern put his face in his hands. A roar of outrage came from Maintenance. It was a well-known fact that Maintenance won every year. Not this year though. Kevin, the sadistic boy wasn't a popular choice among the monsters created, judging by the lack of voting for him. In fact, no one had bet on him in years. It seemed that no one who was chosen knew how to work a projector anymore. Of course the burnout stoner would figure it out. The rest of the betting group shared in Ronald the Intern's disappointment. Sitterson's voice carried over the loud ruckus that had grown in response. \"Everyone calm down!\" Sitterson had always had an authoritative nature to him. It seemed that people listened. \"Kevin may not seem like the best choice for this task. But trust me when I say he'll get the job done. I've seen the kid in action. He'll leave them more dead than you've ever seen a body when he's through with him. Now, you all have jobs to do. Get on with it!\" The crowd dispersed as Hadley joined him at the control station. \"I wish I'd get to see a Merman for once. I mean, this Kevin kid seems interesting at all, but year after year, and I still haven't gotten to see a Merman.\"[Chapter 2] Ch. 2 Marty sat in his chair as Jules blasted the music. Taking a drag from the joint in his hand and rolling his eyes as she danced provocatively around the room, Marty couldn't help but wonder why Jules was acting the way she was. He'd blame it on the alcohol if he hadn't seen her drunk before. And Marty had seen Jules wasted. He'd seen her so drunk that he had to hold her back as she puked, and kept the assholes who'd noticed the fact that she'd filled out in the summer before her senior year away from her. Jules was not herself. Tuning back into the real world, he found Jules kneeling in front of Holden who, despite his predetermined intentions of getting together with Dana- which he'd discovered by listening in on a conversation between Curt and Holden themselves at the pit stop they'd made for snacks- was looking at her in a way that told Marty he wasn't thinking about Dana. Marty took another drag as Jules hands ran up and down Holden's legs. Curt cheered her on in the background, obviously not concerned that it wasn't him that his girlfriend was coming on to. \"Classy.\" The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them. Not that he regretted saying them. Judging by the look on Dana's face, he wasn't the only one who'd been uncomfortable watching the events that had been going down. Marty just hoped Jules wouldn't be mad that he'd interrupted her fun. \"Come on! Like you wouldn't want a piece of that.\" Curt, beer in his hand, motioned towards Jules, who'd started dancing towards Marty. Pieces. That struck a nerve in Marty that nearly cleared his mind. \"Can we not talk about people in pieces anymore tonight?\" Marty took another drag to wipe the image from his mind. It wasn't hard though- Jules had gotten rather close. \"Oh, are you feeling lonely Marty?\" She knelt down in front of Marty like she had with Holden. Looking around quickly to make sure she had audience, she leaned in closer to him. \"Marty and I were sweeties in our freshman hall.\" It took all of Marty's self-control not to laugh. His memory was rather shot in most cases, but the short love affair between Marty Mikalski and Jules Louden was one thing he remembered rather clearly. It was one of those night Jules had gotten dumped. Fulfilling his usual role of comforting friend, Marty found himself seated on a couch with Jules tucked under his arm, sobbing into one of his good shirts. He couldn't count the amount of times he'd found himself in this position since they'd become friends in their first year of high school. He'd liked at first, but who hadn't? Getting to know her, Marty had realized that she wasn't his type- not that she wasn't nice. He just liked the shy type better; they were less likely to get into trouble with a shy girl. It was no surprise to Marty when he developed feelings for Dana Polk- Jules' best friend. The fact that he no longer had feelings for Jules didn't change the fact that he was willing to do anything for Jules to make her happy again. So he found himself promising to marry Jules between kisses, making her smile again. He didn't even think she remembered that though. \"We made out once. I never did buy that ring.\" Jules got up close as Marty stared at her. She'd looked so much better back then as well, with her brown hair. Much better than the blonde she had now. \"But we're still close.\" Jules started dancing again, moving farther away towards the fireplace again. Her movement reminded Marty of a marionette doll, arms swaying as she dipped and rose again. Curt seemed mesmerized by his girlfriend's movements. In the time that he had come to know Curt, Marty had learned that Curt was not your typical jock. Smarter than the rest of the college football team, Curt managed to attend all of his advanced classes as well as every single practice, all while managing to stay polite and happy with everyone, willing to sacrifice anything for the happiness of his friends. Curt was the epitome of a perfect person- always respectful to Jules, which is why Marty and he had become friends. It was also the reason why he was suspicious. Neither Curt nor Jules were acting like their usual selves. Curt seemed like the rest of the assholes on the football team, and Jules- even at her most drunk, single state- never acted this bad. \"I have a theory about all of this.\" Marty spoke out to his friends after taking another drag. Curt interrupted before he could explain further. \"That's time to bale. Tom Chung here has a theory.\" Moving over to Jules and ignoring the questioning glances his friends were shooting him, he grabbed Jules' hand. \"C'mon baby!\" Curt turned to Marty once more. \"Go on… you can uh… you can tell it to egghead here, if he's not too busy de-virginizing Dana.\" Upon mention of her name, Dana's face reddened. Marty could tell that Dana wasn't very appreciative about the whole \"hooking up with Holden,\" thing that Jules and Curt was pressing on her. Just like Curt was pushing Jules out of the cabin door. Dana called out to her friend. \"Jules… do you wanna go lie down?\" Jules looked like she was going to respond but shook her head. Curt answered for her. \"That's exactly the point\" His beer cup spilled a bit as he walked out the door telling Jules to hurry up, leaving the door wide open in his rush to get out. Marty got up out of his chair, having finished his current joint. \"Do you seriously believe nothing weird is going on?\" Forcing Jules out of the cabin and into the woods was even more proof of his theory. Holden- who he'd never really met- wouldn't understand his theories, Dana however, might. He approached her as she closed the door. \"What do you mean?\" Dana shot him a questioning look as she walked towards him crossing her arms. \"The way everybody is acting. Why is Jules suddenly a celebutante? And since when does Curt pull this alpha male bullshit? I mean, he's a sociology major, he's on full academic scholarship and now he's calling his friend an egghead?\" Dana seemed to consider it for a moment and then shook her head. \"Curt's just drunk.\" \"I've seen Curt drunk. Jules too.\" \"Well maybe it's just something else.\" Dana looked down at his hand, where he held his joint. Marty shook his head. He'd hoped Dana would understand what he was trying to say. Thinking hard, he tried to put it into words. \"You're not seeing what you don't want to see.\" He thought back to Jules dancing in front of the fire. \"Puppeteers.\" \"Puppeteers?\" Dana moved in closer. Marty was lost again in a cloud of pot-induced haze. \"Pop Tarts?\" He realized how hungry he was. \"Did you say Pop Tarts?\" Dana laughed for a bit, and then looked at Marty with concern. \"Marty, I love you, but you're really high.\" Dana walked back towards the couch where Holden was sitting, holding a textbook. A single thought drifted through the haze. \"We are not who we are….\" Dana looked back for a moment. \"I'm going to go read a book with pictures.\" Marty was glad he'd brought his book with him. Kevin watched as the couple left the cabin. The Whore first- that was one of the rules he had to follow. That was an easy death; she and the Athlete were both drunk beyond belief already. There was no challenge in the first one. They always stumbled into the forest, drunk beyond belief and not cautious in any way. The timing was the key though, so he watched the couple from the shadows, waiting. It took more manipulations to get the couple how they were supposed to be this time. The Athlete knelt on the ground near the Whore as he removed his shirt- the opportune moment. Before either knew what happened, Kevin had thrown a knife that found itself in the Whore's temple. The Athlete had managed to remove his shirt only to find his girlfriend dead. Kevin smiled to himself, enjoying the look of horror on the Athlete's face, hearing the yells of terror, screaming out \"JULES!\" Finally, looking around at his surroundings, the Athlete realized that the culprit was most likely still there. This was when Kevin had most of his fun. Stepping into the light of the meadow, Kevin drew his second knife. A moment later the Athlete noticed him and jumped up unsteadily. Pointing at Kevin, the larger man charged. Kevin easily sidestepped the attack and raised his knife to arm level. The Athlete nearly screamed at the pain as the knife slid through his skin. Deeper than he'd intended, Kevin adjusted his glasses as the man gazed in horror at the scene before him, bleeding heavily from his arm as he did. Kevin hoped that he wouldn't die from blood loss. That would ruin his fun. Debating telling him to run for it, Kevin turned to the dead Whore. The Athlete was probably too afraid to move. It was time for the best part. Removing the knife from her temple, Kevin crouched down near her limp body, placing the knife on her neck. \"Don't touch her!\" The Athlete seemed to have come out of shock. Glancing up, Kevin found the Athlete, wide eyed as he started walking towards him probably aiming to defend his fallen girlfriend. How romantic. \"It's too late to do anything, you oaf. There isn't anything you can do about her. You might as well let me have my fun, and then I'll be off. Now just sit quietly and don't disturb me.\" Kevin wasn't stupid. He knew that the Athlete wouldn't do as he was told after being provoked so blatantly. So he was ready when the large man attacked again, still unsteady on his feet. Kevin ducked and the Athlete tripped over him, falling to the ground face-first and knocking himself out. He wasn't getting up from that anytime soon, but just to be safe Kevin slit his throat as well. Staring at the large mass of body on the ground, Kevin felt a twinge of regret. He had a strange feeling that the Athlete would have been fun to mess around with. The first two sacrifices gone; now it was time for Kevin to enjoy himself. Taking the knife he'd set down on the Whore, he grabbed her arm and started sawing. Hadley and Sitterson sat safe in their office as Jules was killed. Looking at Hadley, Sitterson nodded, bowed his head, and began to speak. \"This we offer in humility and fear. For the blessed peace of your eternal slumber. As it ever was.\" Hadley bowed his head and repeated Sitterson's last words. Getting up, Hadley walked over to a large wooden panel and opened it up to reveal a lever. Glancing one more time at the screen that showed Jules' and Curt's dead bodies, he pulled the lever, followed by the one next to it. The screen zoomed in on Kevin finishing his job. \"It's almost an art for him, isn't?\" Hadley rejoined Sitterson by the control panels. \"It is. The kid is twisted. You've seen his video right? Those were his family. These people mean nothing to him. His only relationship with them is to kill them. No emotional attachment. The last time he was chosen, the Virgin was strung up and tortured in the basement until dawn when he killed her. That's something you can't forget.\" Sitterson shuddered and turned back to the screen.[Chapter 3] A/N- Apologies for taking so long, it's time for me to write my diplomas and I've been buried in books and have been unable to write. Here's chapter three, enjoy! Dana and Holden sat on the couch, swapping stories about their pasts. Holden was grateful for the kind company Dana provided. As the only unfamiliar face in the cabin that weekend, he'd worried about not fitting in. Dana was excellent company- fun to talk with and easy on the eyes. Holden was happy not to be alone after the event in the cellar. So they sat, drinking beers and talking about other things, trying to forget what they'd seen. And it had started to work. The memory of the boy on the film was just a thought in the back of their minds, fading away as the night went on. As Dana talked about her art class, Holden watched her. There was something off about her. Holden was good at reading people, and could tell Dana was hiding something. \"Marty and I took that class together last year. Well I think we did. Mostly Marty sat there, stoned out of his mind and handed in half the assignments. I'm surprised he even passed art.\" Holden nodded as she spoke. Dana's eyes had gone a little fuzzy as if she were lost in thought. \"So you two are close?\" She looked up at him in surprise. \"Who?\" Holden smiled at Dana. It was obvious that her mind wasn't on art class with Marty. \"Marty, of course.\" With a moment of courage, he grabbed Dana's hand. \"Are you alright?\" Her eyes went wide at the contact. Nodding slowly, she grabbed her beer can with her free hand and took a long sip. \"Oh yeah, we're been friends since we were kids.\" The firelight danced in her eyes as she met his gaze again. \"Although lately there's been something off about him and I can't really tell what it is. Maybe it's the pot.\" She laughed slightly as she turned to watch the fire. Tilting her head as if in thought, Dana spoke softly. \"Holden, can I ask you something?\" Holden hesitated, unsure of what was coming. \"Sure. Go ahead.\" His hand was still holding hers, and he could feel her tighten her grip. \"This may seem cliché, but I have to ask. Do you think I'm pretty?\" She was drunk and it was obvious what her intentions were. But Holden could tell that whatever Dana had been hiding earlier had something to do with it. \"Of course Dana- who wouldn't?\" It wasn't a lie either. He'd seen prettier girls, but Dana wasn't ugly in any way. She turned to face Holden, and leaned in. Next thing he knew, she was kissing him and he was kissing back. His hand slid from her hand onto her leg, and the other one reached up to hold her face. Holden knew he had to stop this. She was drunk and wasn't in her right mind. He knew better than to take advantage of a girl. Pulling away, he looked at her. She gazed back at him, eyes focused. She didn't seem drunk. At least not as drunk as he'd thought she'd been. \"What is it? Oh god, did you not want to…?\" Dana started to freak out and Holden put his hand on her face again. \"No, Dana I just wanted to be sure that you actually wanted to?\" She nodded, leaned in again, and they continued on, not hearing the knock at the cabin door. \"I'll get it.\" The two jumped up at the sound of Marty, trudging out of his room to answer the knock. \"Since you two seem to be busy.\" There was what seemed like a bitter edge to his voice as he moved past them. Somewhere in the back of his mind, something told Holden to stop Marty. But even though he wasn't as out of his mind as Marty or Dana, he pushed it aside as paranoia. What could happen out in the middle of nowhere? It was probably Curt coming back anyways. The door swung open to reveal a young man dressed in all black, his face shadowed except for the light reflecting in his large glasses. There was something about him that seemed oddly familiar, although Holden knew they'd never met before. Even as he stepped into the light, Holden couldn't figure it out. The man looked at the three residents of the cabin and grinned slightly. \"Hello,\" he began. \"Well, my car broke down a little way back and I saw this road and thought I could find somebody that could help me out?\" Marty stared at the man. \"You mean you walked all this way in the dark? The main road is really far.\" The man shrugged slightly. \"I guess I did. This cabin is rather hidden away isn't it, quite a distance from anything else? Anyways, would any of you be able to help me out? I understand it's late and my car is far. I can just walk back if-\" Dana interrupted the stranger. \"I guess Curt would be able to help with that the best, wouldn't he? He's not here though right now.\" Holden caught a glimpse of something flash over the man's face as Dana spoke, but was unable to place what it was. \"Do you know when he'd be back? I have somewhere to be in the morning; otherwise I wouldn't be bothering you.\" The man smiled again. Marty frowned at the man, squinting. \"What did you say your name was?\" \"How rude of me, I didn't. My name is Kevin.\" Holden felt a tug at the back of his head as if something had fallen into place in his memory, but a moment later it was gone again. \"Well Kevin,\" he started. \"Why don't you come in and have a drink while we wait for Curt to come back?\" Kevin smiled and nodded as Holden grabbed a coke from the fridge. Hadley sat at the control panel and leaned back in his seat. \"There we go. This year we have it in the bag. Kevin's in the house and all three tributes aren't thinking. Should we call Japan and tell them to take the weekend off?\" Sitterson took a deep breath. \"What else would they do? Relax?\" He paused for a moment as Hadley laughed. Taking a sip of coffee that had been brought to him, Sitterson stared darkly at the screen that revealed the four people currently in the cabin, sitting on couches chatting softly. \"No,\" he continued with his eyes glued to the image. \"Kevin may be good at his job but he can get carried away with his games. We need Japan for backup.\" Kevin sat by the warm fire for the first time in years. Compared to the dark, enclosed space that he was used to, Kevin felt free. It was relaxing enough for him to take a good look at his next three targets. The Fool, the Scholar, and the Virgin. He'd wished the people downstairs hadn't incapacitated them as much as they had, but they did what was necessary. Maybe , he thought to himself, I could wait until they went to sleep then he could strike. He had until morning, and it was more enjoyable when they were sober- more of a challenge. They were waiting for Curt- Kevin assumed that meant the Athlete, which meant he wasn't coming back. \"So where were you heading Kevin?\" The Fool spoke to him in a suspicious tone. It was obvious that Kevin wasn't trusted by everyone. The people downstairs hadn't done their job as well as they'd thought. The Fool stared at him, expecting an answer. He raked his fingers through his hair as he answered. \"Over to the next town to visit my cousin. She was expecting me by morning. I guess that won't be happening now. Even if your friend comes back soon we'd have to walk all the way back in the dark. He'll be tired. I wouldn't want to bother him.\" The Virgin spoke up, falling for his trick. \"Well we've got an extra room if you needed somewhere to stay for the night.\" The Fool began to protest her suggestion. \"Dana!\" He cried in surprise. \"We barely know the guy!\" Kevin nodded. \"He's right Dana, you don't know me, and I've only just shown up. It would be smarter for me to sleep outside. Thank you for the offer though. I wouldn't want to impose.\" The Virgin glared at the Fool. \"C'mon Marty, don't be such an ass. It's not like Kevin is a serial killer who's come to kill us all in our sleep.\" The Virgin smiled at Kevin politely as he grinned, feeling the weight of the knife pack underneath his black coat. If she only knew there was a knife in there for her. \"You can sleep in here. It's chilly out there, and we've got an extra bed. You're right; Curt isn't going to be much help tonight. Your cousin will just have to wait a while longer for you to get there.\" Kevin finally accepted the invitation, almost laughing to himself. It was almost too easy.[Chapter 4] The fire had died down low. Even though Marty was sitting in the room with three other people, he was only focused on one. Kevin. The name tugged at the back of his mind, but no matter how hard he tried to remember, Marty couldn't quite remember what he'd forgotten. He pulled a new joint from behind his ear. \"Really Marty? Another joint? You need to cut down. This can't be healthy for you.\" Dana's words had become less slurred than they had been earlier. As Marty shrugged, he took a long drag from his newly lit-up joint. He was surprised to find his mind actually felt clearer than it had a moment before. Kevin. \"Kevin! Why don't you open up your first present for the camera.\" The image of a severed head bouncing across a screen flashed across Marty's mind. \"Jesus!\" Marty almost jumped out of his chair as he looked at their guest. \"It's you! You're the sick bastard from the video!\" Finger pointed at Kevin, Marty started to back away towards the couch. Holden stood up and grabbed Marty's shoulders. \"C'mon man. You're too high to even know what you're saying.\" He turned Marty towards the back rooms and turned back to Kevin. \"I'm sorry man, Marty's a strange one.\" Marty broke free from Holden's grip. \"No! No! No! No man, you're the one who doesn't know. This guy is the guy from the video! It's so easy to see! Wake up!\" He started snapping his fingers in front of Holden's face. Dana got up from the couch and grabbed Marty's arm. \"Marty, honey. You need to get some sleep. Here, I'll help you to bed.\" He gave Holden an apologetic look as she grabbed the joint from Marty's' hand. Holden returned to his seat on the couch and apologized to Kevin. \"Oh, it's fine. I don't mind. I don't know what he's talking about though.\" Holden didn't notice the glint in Kevin's eyes as he explained the incident in the cellar. He also didn't notice as Kevin began to reach into his pocket, running his finger along one of the silver knives. He didn't know that as he spoke, Kevin felt the words \" The Scholar \" written on the blade. Kevin didn't know how close Kevin was to drawing that blade. \"I don't want any of it Marty. I'm putting this joint out and you can start again once you're thinking clearly.\" Dana took hold of the joint and moved it towards the ashtray. Marty moved quickly and grabbed her wrist. \"Dana. I'm thinking clearly. There was something wrong with my weed earlier. I was out of it, my joint- the one in your hand. I rolled that right before I left my house. It never left my pocket until just now. It cleared my mind. Dana, please. Look into my eyes and see if I'm stoned. Just do it quick. Holden is out there right now with that psycho. He could be dead already.\" \"Marty, don't be silly. Holden is perfectly fine. Now let go of my wrist Marty. It's time for bed.\" Marty grabbed the joint and took in a big breath. \"Oh my god Marty, that's enou-\" She was interrupted by Marty's mouth. She felt the smoke in her lungs as he exhaled into her. She expected her head to start spinning like it did the occasional time she tried weed. But it didn't. Marty brought his hand up to her face. Dana ripped away from Marty, realizing her mistake. \"Oh my god Marty…\" she spoke it quietly this time instead of the anger from the last. Marty's hand remained in the air for a second longer, then dropped down to his side as his face turned red. He shot her a smug grin, then ran out the door, Dana following. \"HOLDEN!\" Kevin ran his finger along the flat edge of the knife. \"So how often does Marty have these problems? He seems pretty convinced that he was right.\" The Scholar was quick to answer. \"Oh, I'm not really the most familiar with these guys. Curt invited me. I'm just meeting these guys for the first time this weekend.\" The Scholar leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes for a moment. Kevin slid the knife out of its sheath. This Scholar seemed more muscular than the last. It might be better to just end it now. Or at least incapacitate him. The Scholar didn't open his eyes as he got closer. Kevin heard a noise from the hallway and struck quickly. He felt the tearing of flesh as the knife cut through the flesh of The Scholar's arm. Kevin couldn't help but smile at the sight of pain on his victims' face. That's when he felt pain himself, and the room started to spin. Kevin lost his balance and tumbled to the floor as his head cracked. He heard The Virgin call out to The Scholar as The Fool, who was very close to Kevin, told them to run. His vision cleared and he looked up to see The Fool standing above him, a large silver club-like mug in his hand. The makeshift club had blood on it. Reaching up, Kevin felt a hot sticky substance and screamed. It had been a long time since Kevin had seen his sown blood. He wasn't screaming out of fear or pain though- Kevin was angry. And The Fool, along with the others, had gone. Fools had gotten stronger since Kevin had last been out to play. This was proving more difficult than usual. It wasn't a problem though. This was going to be just as fun as the first time. Kevin picked himself up off the ground and wiped his head. There was still some pain, but thanks to the chemical changes the scientists downstairs had done to him he was able to heal faster than normal. Kevin stepped out onto the front porch and once again stared out at the moon. The night was still young and he was just getting started. \"Oh yes,\" Remarked Hadley. \"We have no need to worry. Kevin will get the job done.\" He turned his chair around to look at Sitterson, who was making a coffee. \"It's not over yet. And besides, that isn't his fault. The Chem department obviously missed something. Keep faith in the little guy.\" Sitterson went back to his chair and sat down, placing his mug on the control panel. \"It doesn't matter who's fault it is! This division hasn't messed up in a long time. We can't have him fail. \" Sitterson could hear the worry in Hadley's voice. He'd always been the calmer of the two- Hadley was very nervous when under stress. It was Sitterson's job to calm him down. \"He won't fail. The night isn't done yet, and they've just made him angry. It's all a game when Kevin's happy. The minute he loses thought of the game is when it gets interesting. And it's only The Fool and The Virgin. We only need one more death.\" Sitterson took a sip of his coffee. \"So sit back and relax, Hadley. Enjoy the show.\" Holden was losing blood. Lots of it. And fast. Marty and Dana, who were supporting him as they retreated through the forest, were covered in it. They couldn't make it far with Holden's dead weight. His voice was weak when he spoke. \"Guys… put… me down….\" Dana and Marty looked at each other and then set him up against a tree. Marty ripped a strip of cloth from his shirt and wrapped it around Holden's cut. \"Don't bother man. I'm done. I've lost too much blood. Just look at you guys. There's more of it on you than there is in me. Just leave me man. I'll pass out. I need you guys to stay calm and get help. Get back to the main road, or try and find Curt and Jules. No matter what, you need to stay safe. That freak is a… psycho. You saw what he did on the tape. Don't let him get to you, okay?\" Holden's voice was slowly getting quieter, and there was a painful rasp in it. \"You guys… gotta get… away.\" His eyes began to droop and his head was bobbing. The cloth Marty had wrapped around his arm was soaked through. Dana shivered as a cold wind blew. She was trying hard not to cry. Despite not knowing him long, she'd enjoyed Holden's company. And there was something so surreal about what was happening. When did a murderer come into a house and pretend to be their friend? A murderer who didn't look any older now than he did in that film? That only happened in movies. And why hadn't she recognized him right away? It wasn't like she could get the image of his face out of her mind. He had an unforgettable face- attractive, with a dark, sinister hint to it. Marty grabbed Dana's hand and they sat down on the cold ground. \"We will stay with you Holden. You don't deserve to die alone.\" Dana's voice caught as she spoke. So they sat in the darkness and waited. A/N- I am so so so sorry it took so long. And I'm sorry I had to kill Holden, but I gave him a better death than he got in the movie, right? Choosing to die? I know there were a few of you that wanted Dana and Holden to get together, but I always picture it as DanaxMarty. Not that this is a romance story. I'm all about the blood and death.[Chapter 5] AN: I'm so sorry this took so long to update. I just graduated, and went on a band tour down to the states, then my parents took the laptop I had everything saved on so I had to come up with this from scratch. Please forgive me, hopefully I can finish this one soon. I'm getting close to the ending. Enjoy. Ch. 5 Puppeteers Kevin happened upon the body before it had even gone cold. The Scholar sat propped up against a tree, his jeans soaked in a pool of his own blood. Kevin cursed under his breath at the ease it had taken. It was supposed to be his time to have fun but these stupid, stupid, people were taking that away from him. The Whore and The Athlete had been alright- for a warm up at least. He would have liked to mess around with The Athlete some more, but it had been logical to end it quickly. After those two was when he had some real fun. Kevin thought back to the last Scholar he had killed. He had forced The Virgin to watch as he'd cut bits and pieces from the tie-dyed hippie's body. It almost gave him a pleasant, nostalgic feel as he recollected the event. Years later though, after all that time in the box, Kevin merely felt a slightly warm tingle in his body trying to push it's way out in the cold night air. Bringing his attention back to the wasted body in front of him, Kevin pondered what could be done to try and salvage the mess. Grabbing the knife labeled \" The Scholar ,\" he walked towards the limp body and got to work. \"We won't get far on foot.\" Dana walked a few steps behind Marty, constantly looking around at the forest around them. The moon was high and bright as darker clouds floated by in the sky. The light was both comforting and frightening at the same time. Marty stopped and let her catch up. They had to keep moving. \"We have to try and stay positive Dana.\" \"How the hell can we stay positive Marty? You saw what happened back there, right? Are you still stoned out of your mind?\" Marty gave Dana an offended look. \"I very well might be! But you seem to have forgotten who saved your ass back there! If it weren't for me we'd most likely be in the same predicament as the others!\" \"We don't know if Curt and Jules are-\" her words got caught in her throat as she tried to speak. Marty's face softened as he saw her. \"I didn't mean it that way Dana. We can keep looking for them. They could still be out here. It would be easier to find them if we had Curt's RV.\" \"No way. We aren't going back to the cabin. If I were that freak, that'd be the first place I'd check.\" Marty nodded as Dana folded her arms and stared at the ground. Her hair was matted onto her face and there was blood covering her sleeves. \"Oh god this is horrible Marty. What the hell is happening to us?\" A soft, cold breeze made her shiver ever so slightly. Pulling his sweater over his head, he tossed it to her. \"We will figure this out Dana. For now we have to keep moving though. For Holden. We promised right? I've got your back.\" Marty put his arm around Dana's shoulders once the sweater was on. \"I've got you. Sitterson took a sip of his lukewarm coffee and put his feet up on the control board. \"We have to get them back to the Cabin. Then we can direct Kevin back as well and the game is won.\" \"You know Kevin won't like the help. He likes to do it all on his own.\" Hadley \"Besides. When they hit the barrier, they'll have no choice but to head back. They'll try to get the RV like The Fool suggested.\" Sitterson nodded in agreement. \"I'm just glad they didn't start off towards the canyon. That would be a tough one to recover from.\" Hadley was silent for a moment, and then spoke up again. \"Can't we have some fun with this though? I'd feel a bit better if I knew they were at least running in the right direction after they hit the barrier. Sitterson sighed and rubbed his temples for a moment. \"Okay- I'll think of something.\" Marty didn't see the root sticking out of the ground. Dana did, but it was too late to say anything by the time she realized. So instead, Marty flew headfirst into the invisible barrier in front of him with a cry. \"What the fuck was that?\" Marty whispered to Dana as she kneeled in front of him on the ground. Dana touched his head where it had collided with the barrier. \"I've got no clue, but I think we should find out.\" She stood up and put her hand out in front of her. Walking forwards, it hit something and the area around her hand turned blue. Turning back to face Marty where he still sat on the ground, she whispered to him. \"It's some kind of Barrier.\" Marty rubbed his forehead, which had already started to bruise. \"Why the hell would there be a barrier out in the middle of a freaking forest?\" Dana shrugged as she moved to the left, keeping her hand on the barrier. \"It's like we're in some kind of sci-fi movie Marty. Some kind of freaky, real life sci-fi horror movie. What kind of sick people would do this?\" \"How could someone do this? Barriers like this don't exist in reality. Maybe we're part of a government experiment gone wrong?\" Marty got up and ran his hand along the barrier in the other direction. \"What the fuck…\" He trailed off to himself. \"You really think the government would agree to let five people get killed by a maniac inside of a giant cage?\" Dana walked back towards Marty. \"If they had a good enough reason maybe. But anyways- this isn't a government experiment. That was a stupid idea. But you have to agree with me. Some sick shit is going on.\" Dana nodded and stared up at the sky. They were silent for a moment. \"This doesn't leave us with many options, and every minute we spend here, Kevin could be catching up to us. We can either follow this barrier or try and get back to the Cabin and hope Kevin isn't waiting for us there. I'd vote for the barrier. That way if Kevin is following us, we might have a chance at going to other way once he hits the barrier.\" \"I think that's a good idea. So, which way?\" \"Want to try left?\" Dana grabbed Marty's hand and started to walk. \"Do you hear that Dana?\" Marty stopped for a moment. Dana could hear the sound of a faint buzzing in the distance. \"Can you fear the bees as well? Or did I hit my head harder than I thought back there?\" \"No, I can definitely hear them. And it sounds like they're getting closer.\" Marty could hear the noise growing louder. \"I think that means we are supposed to run.\" Dana took off with Marty close behind her. Leaping over tree roots and ducking under low hanging branches. Even as they were running, they could hear the buzz getting closer. With longer legs, Marty managed to get in front of Dana. \"It's chasing us back the way we came from! We're heading back towards the cabin!\" Dana managed to yell at Marty as she ran. \"This can't be a-\" Marty ducked under a branch and almost lost his balance \"-coincidence!\" The swarm was almost on them, and Marty slowed down just a little so Dana was in front of him. That's when he lunged, grabbing Dana as he fell to the side of the path they had been running on. The buzzing quieted down instantly as they tumbled into a ditch. Dana and Marty landed in a tangle of legs and arms at the bottom of the ditch. \"That swarm came out of nowhere! Did you even see a nest?\" Marty picked himself off the ground and sat on the side of the ditch. \"No. And I think you were right about it not being a coincidence it chased us back to the cabin. It makes no sense, and I don't know how it's happening, but I think something was controlling them.\" Dana was silent for a moment as she walked over beside Marty and sat down, picking bark and leaves out of her hair. \"Controlling us…. Marty, what was it that you said about puppeteers earlier? Back when I was trying to get you to get to bed? How no one was acting the way they were supposed to. And that I wasn't seeing what I didn't want to see? Puppeteers. You were right. There's someone out there, watching us, like in one of your conspiracy theories. Just this one is real, isn't it?\" Marty sat there, pondering what Dana had said. Then, he stood up abruptly. \"FUCKING PUPPETS!\" He yelled into the sky. \"They've got us hooked up to strings like bloody freaking puppets, dancing around to a song we can't hear.\" \"Marty you have to calm down. We're really close to the cabin. I don't want to risk being heard. We could make it to the RV if we were quick. I think Curt left the keys in there. I'd feel safer. It might even be worth it.\" \"Or, Big Brother could send something worse than bees to get us back. Maybe they'll get tired of us and kill us.\" He walked over and sat down next to Dana again. \"I think it's worth the shot. What else are we going to do? Sit here and hope Kevin gets bored? Wait till sunrise and see if he disappears?\" She put her head on Marty's shoulder and he froze for a moment before relaxing again. He couldn't help but find it funny that after all those years of being into her, the only time he'd ever been able to hold her hand was in the face of danger. His face reddened as he thought back to the kiss earlier. Pushing aside the thought, he turned to Dana. \"Well it's now or never- we have to move quick before I start doubting what we're about to do.\" ","Summary":" A/N- So I watched this movie last night and I loved it so much. I'm surprised there isn't more fanf"},{"Movie":"Cabin in the Woods","Title":"My Version of Cabin in the Woods","Author":"MadisonJillian","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8811098","Passage":"[Chapter 1] My Version of Cabin in the Woods Prologue Before I start, this is what I think cabin in the woods should have gone. I made the \"Ancient Ones\" gods from three mythologies that I know well of. Those are Greek, Norse, and finally Japan. The main summary is basically the gods decide that, instead of walking up and destroying the world, to bring the Organization, archetypes (whore, athlete, fool, scholar, and virgin), and the monsters back to life. They make the monsters not want to attack innocent people but attack ruthless bastards that want to do harm to innocents (me: FINALLY! A fanfic where the monsters aren't considered evil! :D). I will add a couple of OC monsters such as a shapeshifter who mainly turns into a white wolf and a Diclonii similar to the one in Elfen Lied. Lastly, this is supposed to be view as an anime because ANIME IS AWESOME! Now, with that settled, let's begin the fanfic: Zeus, the superior god of the Greek gods, watched as the walls of the Organization slowly started to crumbled. Any second now, a giant hand would come out of the ground and destroy the world. Those pathetic humans deserved this , the great god thought. The gods hate the modern day human since they never cared about anything but themselves. It made the gods sick. That's why the great gods created this sacrifice of 5 teenagers and the monsters to slay them. The Greek god was about to unleash the fiery monsters within the earth when he noticed two of the five teenagers curled up on the floor, awaiting their death. It dawned on the god that these teenagers were going to die along the rest of their people in order for the Ancient Ones to create another race. In some way that sounded quite…brave. Finally, the walls of the cabin and Organization caved in, killing what's left of the Organization people, monsters, the virgin, and the fool. Before the giant hand could come out of the crumbling Earth, Zeus stopped the Apocalypse. Hera, Zeus' wife, ran in. She was worried why her husband would stop something as important as this. \"W-w-what are you doing?\" Hera asked, her voice shaky from exhaustion and fear. \"I decided that we will give humanity another chance and if we find one person not worthy of this chance, we will kill them.\" His calmness almost scared Hera even more. \"How are we suppose to do that?! We killed the monsters and it is quite hard to find the few evil people in the world when there are 7.04 billion people in the world.\" Hera was now hysterical. \"It will be quite easy, my dear. Just go tell the other gods to go down to Earth near where the cabin used to be and I will tell everyone my plan. Either that or show them, which may be the easiest way to explain.\" Zeus let Hera leave the room before bringing himself to Earth, right where he wanted all the gods to meet. He made sure he was disguised as a healthy business man with short black hair, slightly tan skin, and sunglasses. Within a few moments, the Greek, Norse, and Japanese gods were right before him, all in their business men and women forms. \"Gods, I have brought you all here so we can watch over humanity personally.\" The many gods and goddess murmured to themselves about how or why Zues suddenly had a change of heart. Amaterasu helped answer that. \"Brother, why do you suddenly want to help the humans when 10 minutes earlier you were going to destroy them?\" Zeus looked to his \"Sister\". She had long, straight, black hair, a thin body, and also was wearing sunglasses. \"Because, sister, I have looked at the humanity as a whole and found that there are only a few truly evil people in the world.\" Again, this caused the gods to murmur to themselves but no one else stepped forward. \"Brother and Sisters, we need to go and bring those that had died here back to life. I have a plan to help us with destroying the evil in this world.[Chapter 2] My Version of Cabin in the Woods Chapter 1: Reviving Everything The gods decided that it would be best to rebuild the cabin and Organization first. Zeus spoke out first in Latin then the rest of the gods joined in. It was translated to this: Oh revive this place to what it use to be. This once hell turned haven. Bring the walls up and let us inside to what it truly is. The walls of the cabin started to rebuild itself and soon, the cabin was back to what it once was. If the cabin was rebuilt, then the Organization must also have been rebuilt. Next, the gods brought back the 5 archetypes by speaking this translated Latin: Oh bring back the sacrifices for they had failed. They were neither less innocent and naïve to understand their fate. Let them live on this soil once again. Five bright lights took form of 5 individuals. It died down and the teenagers were staring at the gods, obviously shocked at what happened. Dana, the virgin, spoke first. \"Where are we? The last I remember is Marty and I in the Organization waiting for the world to die. And how are you all suppose to be?!\" Zeus looked over to the girl he saw in the ritual room. \"We have brought you all back to life to help us fight the truly evil in the world. We are gods. The same ones that your deaths would keep us asleep for another year.\" Four out of the 5 teenagers were shocked at coming face to face with the almighty beings but Marty, the fool, spoke up; oblivious to whom the people truly are. \"WHAT! How are we suppose to help you fight these 'evil people'?\" \"You 5 will have the power to control the monsters. We can't handle them since we aren't young, but you 5 can.\" The way Zeus said this seemed to indicate that the teenagers were not as smart as he since they didn't figure it out on their own. Before any of the other 3 teenagers (the whore, the athlete, and the scholar) could speak up, the gods moved to the cabin door and waited for the teens to hurry up. Dana moved first and the other 4 followed after her. The gods moved to one part of the room and the teens followed yet again. Once they all settled on that part of the room, the gods created an elevator using that floor they were standing on and some glass windows they also created to make sure no one fell off the moving platform. The elevator moved down until it hit the floor of the Organization. All the dead bodies were gone and so were the monsters. Everyone stepped out of the elevator and the gods spoke in Latin which translated to this: Those who fell victim to fate's cruelness shall rise once again. They, too, had failed us but we will bring them to life to feel the warmth of the sun's rays once again. There was a bright light that engulfed the room and the teens looked away. When the light dimmed, the hallways were filled with people as they go about their way to make sure the teens had died. Then the people realized that the teens were right there. The Director walked in and also noticed the teenagers, but she also saw the gods and knew that they were the gods the Organization had so much trouble trying to keep them asleep. \"What are you doing here?\" The Director asked in a husky whisper. \"We have come to take over this Organization. With it's help, we can fight the evil and darkness in this world.\" Zeus explained to her. The Director simply sighed. \"Fine. If that is what you want, then I will not argue.\" She then went over to a microphone that was sitting on one of the desks and spoke into it. \"Everyone, attention please, the teenagers and business people shall not be hurt in any way. Those business people are actually the gods and they won't hurt us if we do what they asked.\" The people were shocked but they knew that the Director would never lie to them so they didn't try to hurt the teens. The Director turned to Zeus. \"What do you want us to do now?\" \"We want you to bring us to your monitor that shows us the monsters.\" Zeus told her. They walked into the control room where Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley were looking at the many monitors to see that everyone was still there at the Organization and not dead. The Director asked the men which monitor was for the monster and they pointed to a monitor that had many, many glass boxes that had nothing inside them. They put the image on the biggest screen in the center of the room so they can see the empty boxes up close. The gods spoke out the Latin words one last time to revive the monsters: Oh bring the hellish things to life. Monsters and ghosts and demons. They shall listen to the archetypes and kill whoever is deemed evil. The light on the monitor brightened and dimmed within a second. All the monsters were back in their own cages and, seemingly, asleep. Hadley pointed out that there were a few new monsters they never saw before. One box was filled with nothing but hands coming out of the walls. Another box had a young female teenager with short pink and a pair of short horns that looked like cat ears on her scalp. Lastly, there was one box with a cute teenage girl with white wolf ears on her head and a wolf tail on her lower back. It is really rare to come across cute teenagers amongst their monster collection. \"Is there a large screen that the monsters can see once they wake up? I want to talk to all the monsters 'face to face'.\" Zeus asked. Sitterson nodded and pushed a button that showed Zeus' human face on a large screen in front of all the boxes. \"Monsters! Wake up!\" Zeus' voice boomed through the speakers in the large room. The wolf girl looked up, startled, to see a god on the large screen. She wasn't alone in this sudden awakening. All the monsters seemed as surprised as she was. When the humans see the gods, the only see the human form that the gods use. But when the monsters saw Zeus on the screen, they knew that it was a god and they must obey him. \"Monsters! I have something very important to tell you.\" Zeus said through the speakers, \"You will all obey the archetypes and fight the evil in this world.\" Marty snickered, \"He makes us sound like superheroes.\" Zeus simply ignored him. \"I will give all of you the gift of speech and human form. You can also change the gender of this form. These gifts will help you wander into human society without them knowing what you truly are. Of course, I won't leave you all in those small boxes. You may wander around this Organization as you please.\" With that finished, Zeus exited the monitor room and walked to the control panel that controls the boxes. He whispered a spell to give the monsters these \"gifts\" that he promised them. Once he got to his destination, he pushed the same buttons Dana pushed that helped the monsters escape their cells. He waited until the elevators' lights blinked on and some of those monsters walked out. There was the werewolf, the Hell Lord, the Sugerplum Fairy, the merman, the giant snake, the dolls, the doctors, the unicorn, the wraith, and finally the wolf girl and the Diclonii. Before Zeus can begin to tell them his plan, a siren went off. \"Looks like it is your time to shine.\" He said with a smirk. The monsters nodded and left to find the intruder before he could do any harm to the Organization.[Chapter 3] My Version of Cabin in the Woods Chapter 2: The First Kill The nightmares ran quickly through the halls. They had to turn into female humans so they don't raise any alarm through the people of the Organization. Also, being female will make the intruder feel that they are harmless. The wolf girl (her name is Okami since it means \"wolf\" in Japanese) and the werewolf were trying to find the intruder's scent but with so many people it is hard to tell. \" Damn ,\" Okami muttered as the group kept running into dead ends. \" At this rate, we will never find that son of a bitch. \" As the group ran into yet another dead end, there was a gunshot and a woman screaming in pain some ways done the corridor. That helped the nightmares a lot. Within a few seconds, they were at the monitor room doorwhere they had detected the gunshot to have fired. All the nightmares thought the same thing: I hope that scream wasn't from one of our masters! (They meant the archetypes). Okami opened the door and sighed a breath of relief. The women that screamed was one of the scientists that they didn't know. But when the nightmares looked up, they saw the intruder pointing a gun at Jules, the whore archetype. The intruder was wearing baggy pants, a hoodie, and a ski mask on his head. By the way he spoke; he seems to be of a Mexican heritage. (No offense to Mexicans!) The intruder looked at the nightmares but all he saw were girls around 17, 18, and 19 years of age. \"Hi babes.\" The intruder said. The nightmares couldn't tell if he was high on pot, drunk, or both. They don't care anyway. All the man was is dead meat to them. Okami's eyes kept darting to the archetypes to see what they want the nightmares to do to this guy. Curt, the athlete archetype, spoke first since his girlfriend was Jules. \"MONSTERS! ATTACK THAT SON OF A BITCH!\" \" You don't have to tell us twice .\" Okami smirked when she said this. Okami made the first move. She turned into a large white wolf with scythe on her back as a weapon. One by one, the nightmares showed their true colors to the intruder. Before any of them could kill the bastard, Holden (the scholar archetype) yelled out to them. \"Don't kill him right away. We may need him to see who sent him and how they know about us.\" The monsters nodded and ran at the man. The man screamed and started to run away. That was until the giant snake bit his legs which caused them to become paralyzed. The werewolf attacked one of the flailing man's arms so the man can't fight back with it. The sugarplum fairy secured the other arm for the same reason. The man was still screaming as the doctors closed in on him. One of them placed a scalpel on the man's throat but did not kill the man. Curt kneeled down so he could talk to the intruder. \"P-p-please! I beg of you! Have mercy on me!\" The man's voice was shaken from both fear and pain. Curt leaned foreword even more until he could whisper into the man's ear. \"You had no mercy for that woman. Why should I show mercy to a murderer who almost shot my girlfriend.\" \"I'm sorry! I promise I will never do that again!\" The man pleaded once more. Curt shook his head. \"I will make sure you won't do it again.\" With that said, Curt walked away. Holden then walked up to the shivering man. \"How about this. I will let you go if you tell us who sent you.\" Curt gave Holden the evil eye while the nightmares looked at Holden, confused. \"Y-yes! I was sent be the m-mafia. They learned of this from hacking into the Government's database. We wanted to take this place over so they sent me to do it. Others will be showing up later to take it over completely. That is all I know, so please let me go!\" Holden nodded and the nightmares got off the man. The giant snake bit his legs again but this time inserting the antidote to the paralyzing poison. Just as the man is about to leave, though, Holden grabbed his arm. \"I will let you go IF you can escape these monsters. I will give you a running start but I will warn you, wolves and unicorns can run pretty fast.\" The man was horrified. He ran out as fast as he could and as soon as he was out of the room, Holden shouted \"GO!\" to the nightmares. They ran out of the room (except merman since he can't run) and not long after, they heard ferocious snarling and a pained scream. The two sounds went for a good 5 minutes until they stopped. All that the people could hear was low growling and the tearing of meat. When the nightmares got back, they were in their female human forms once again but this time covered in thick blood. \"Do you think those monsters will get stoned or drunk off that blood?\" Leave it to Marty to ask that question. \"Are you drunk or stoned?\" Dana asked the nightmares as they continue to lick the blood off of themselves. Okami shrugged. I don't think so but none of us ever were drunk or stoned. There was an awkward silence after that. All the people could here was the licking of blood coming from the nightmares. The Director decided to break it. \"We should go see if Zeus freed the other nightmares. I sure hope they are all as obedient as you all are.\" The nightmares nodded and they left with the Director and the archetypes following them. On the land the cabin was sitting on, a man was running for his life. He had a camera strapped around his neck and he was sweating, a lot. He was sent with the other man to take pictures of the Organization to show their boss. The now dead man was going to show those bitches that they meant business and the camera guy would take pictures. The camera guy was hiding in the air vents above the monitor room the dead man was in. He took pictures of the hot girls that bursted in…and also when they turned into monsters. He took picture when they attacked the other man and even when they chased him down. The screams and growls will haunt him forever. He finally reached a black van a ways out of the forest. There, his boss waited for the men to arrive. \"Where is the other one, Dogface?\" The camera man, supposedly named \"Dogface\", showed his boss the pictures he took. When he got to when the girls turned into monsters, his boss grinned. \"Hm, these monsters would make excellent bodyguards. I may even find a use for their…human girl counterparts.\" The sick man grinned. \"Send another spy right away. I want us to have a look at these monsters.\"[Chapter 4] My Version of Cabin in the Woods Chapter 3: The Plan \"Damn! How the FUCK did the mafia get into the Government's database! I thought it was secret!\" As Curt ranted on about the mafia getting into the Government's \"secret\" database, the Organization was trying to figure out what they should do. It's hard to attack the mafia right away, as they learned, because of several people who attempted it and failed horribly. Even the nightmares weren't sure if they can take on something as big as this. \" God, will you shut up already! Your ranting is not helping any! \" The Diclonii, whose name is Tsuna, growled. That shut Curt up. A wraith appeared, rather frantically, and dropped a picture of when the nightmares took down the intruder. Dana picked it up and inspected it. \"Another guy must have been with the intruder and took pictures.\" Dana pointed out. \"This is not good.\" Marty seemed to be a bit scared about a man taking pictures. \"If he took pictures of the nightmares, we're pretty much doomed.\" Everyone was now staring at Marty, waiting for him to explain. \"Well, they know of our secret weapon and they will probably create something to either destroy this weapon or at least take it away from us.\" The nightmares were growling. No FUCKING way is some rich fat asshole going to take them away! \"Maybe we can sabotage their HQ or whatever by tricking them. I know this sounds a bit whorish but we can use sex or money. From what I know about the mafia, they love both of those plus violence.\" Everyone now stared at Jules. Damn, she may be damn as a doornail but when it comes to some stuff, she knows what to say. They would disagree about using sex/money to get their way but honestly, what else does the mafia really like. They like violence but the Organization doesn't have enough guns and the nightmares would have a hard time fighting a group of people who know that they are going to attack. When the nightmares attacked the Organization, those people had no idea what hit them. Unknown to the people and monsters, Dogface was in the vents watching and taking pictures of the nightmares. He had drowned himself in air freshener spray so he won't be detected. His camera was made to be silent so that wasn't a problem. There were about 50 nightmares, as the man could tell. I think we can take on 50 monsters. The man thought to himself. He had a bunch of darts his boss had given him. Supposedly, the darts have something on them that can make the nightmares faint. Dogface decided that he will try it out on one of these nightmares. The ghost (wraith) would be good to take out because it can go through walls and air vents easier than any other nightmare. He picked up the straw with the dart already inside and aimed carefully at the ghost. One…two…three! The dart flew out of the straw and hit the wraith in the \"chest\". Instead of the dart going through the ghost, it stuck to it. The wraith screamed so loud in pain that everyone, even the nightmares, had to cover their ears. Dogface took this chance and went the same way he came. He managed to escape with no one noticing him. After a few minutes, the wraith turned into a human girl and fainted in that form. The pain was so strong that the ghost lost control of its formation and its human counterpart couldn't take the pain so it fainted. \" Wraith! Are you OK! \" Okami cried out. The Director ordered a few of the Organization doctors to take the poor girl to the infirmary to rest up. The werewolf lifted its nose and sniffed the air. \" Okami! I smell something. \" The werewolf stared at a part of the air vent and Okami followed his gaze. She noticed a small piece of clothing there. \" Witch, do you mind getting that piece of cloth from that air vent? \" The witch nodded and floated upwards until it was close to the vent. She lifted her bony hand up and grasped the cloth peaking out. She floated back down and handed the cloth the Okami. Okami examined the cloth and sniffed it. \" It looks like that same person sneaked back here to take more pictures. Heh, they even covered themselves in air freshener spray so we couldn't smell him. If it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get. \" After the incident with the wraith, all the nightmares were pissed off. \"Come on! Let's form a plan of action against those son of a bitches!\" Hadley cheered. \"Here is some more pictures of those monsters.\" Dogface handed the collection over to his boss, who took them greedily. \"There are more than before.\" The boss pointed out. \"Yeah, about 50 of them. Some of them look like normal humans and others look like they belong in hell.\" Dogface commented. \"All the other drug lord will be terrified of me once I have these as my body guards. Some of these monsters don't look to bad.\" The boss said as he looked at Kevin, a sweet looking teenage boy that looks like he could work at Best Buy (until he dismembers people), and the Hell Lord, a pale man with black pupils, no hair, black leather clothes, and three saws coming out of his head. The Hell Lord is the lord of bondage and pain but he still looked kind of hot. \"Anyways, get those darts ready. Who knows when those things will attack.\" The boss ordered and Dogface left to do what he was told.[Chapter 5] My Version of Cabin in the Woods Chapter 4: Kidnapped The Organization was still trying to figure out the best technique they can use to ambush these mafia bastards. Sitterson sighed when their plan still didn't come together. He turned to the nightmares to see that they, too, could not come up with a good plan. \"You all should go and find something else to do. Who knows, maybe one of you might get a great idea after walking around a bit.\" Most nightmares went back to the little boxes they were originally in. These boxes made them feel safe from those mafia bastards. A few nightmares walked around the place either to explore it or find clues. Unlike all the other nightmares, the Hell Lord Fornicus decided to go outside and look. He has a greater chance, in his mind, finding clues out there. Just before he walked into the elevator door goes up to the cabin, he heard a voice behind him. \" Where are you going? \" Fornicus sighed in relief. It was only Kevin. \" Outside; I think that would be a good place to start. \" Fornicus' voice was soft compared to what most people would think. \" Well, I will go outside, too. There are already nightmares checking out this facility. \" Kevin walked past Fornicus and into the elevator. Fornicus followed, still clutching the sphere puzzle in his hands. The elevator went up until it reached the floor of the cabin and the two nightmares walked out. \" How about you check out this cabin and see how that person got in. I will be outside to see if there was another way he got in. If someone sees me outside, they won't shriek and run away. Those buzz saws will really make you stand out. \" Fornicus nodded. Kevin was right. If someone saw the Hell Lord walking about, then people might start showing up more and may even find the Organization. No one wants that. Kevin walked outside and looked around the cabin, looking at the out side walls to see if there was an opening. Dogface was going to walk up to the cabin but he saw someone was already there. He hid behind a tree and peered out to see who this person was. It was a sweet looking teenage boy, around the age of 18. He had short chocolate colored hair with hazelnut colored eyes. He was wearing a loose black t-shirt and dark blue jeans. He seemed to be looking for something on the walls of the cabin. Dogface was about to go see if this boy needed any help but stopped when he recognized this boy from one of the picture Dogface took of the nightmares. This boy is a monster! Dogface thought to himself. But he sure is cute. I can see why boss liked him so much. Dogface grabbed the dart and straw from his pocket, along with a piece of cloth. He purposely stepped on a twig to cause a loud crack to fill the air. Kevin turned to stare at a tree. He swore he heard a crack from behind it. He grabbed his switch blade from his jean pocket. He ALWAYS carries a blade with him. Dogface saw the boy approach the tree with a blade in his hand. When the boy was close enough to the tree, Dogface stepped out and blows the dart at the boy. The dart hit Kevin on the shoulder. His body was in shock when the pain hit. Before he could scream for Fornicus' help, the man grabbed him and placed a cloth over his mouth. This caused him to drop the blade. In moments, Kevin passed out. Dogface grabbed his phone and called for backup to come and pick the boy up. When he put the phone away, he saw a shadow through one of the cabin windows. Dogface smirked. Looks like there is another monster in the cabin. He walked up to the cabin door and knocked a couple of times. He had another dart in the straw and the same cloth he used on the boy. Fornicus heard the knock and that it was Kevin. I wonder why Kevin doesn't just open the door. He walked up to the door and opened it. Right when it was opened enough for him to see who was knocking on the door, a dart hit him in the neck. He groaned and dropped his puzzle ball on the ground. A cloth was over his mouth and he fainted from pain and lack of oxygen. Dogface opened up his cell phone again and asked for more back up. A few minutes later, the back up came and picked up the two unconscious monsters. Dogface followed the back up team until they reached the van his boss was in. They through the nightmares in front of their boss and left to go to the van they came in. Dogface went into the van and sat next to the nightmares. \"Good job, Dogface. I knew there was a reason I decided to keep you.\" Dogface looked down at the monsters. \"I can see why you think they are hot. I might want to 'borrow' one of them.\" His boss grinned. \"I will let you borrow one of them once I am done with them. But first, let's tie them up so they can't attack. Once we get back to my place, I want the little one tied to my bed. I want to use him first. When we are done with them, we will study them and create a much powerful weapon that can kill those other monsters.\" Dogface nodded and told the driver to go back to the bosses place. He tied the monsters so they couldn't get away.[Chapter 6] My Version of Cabin in the Woods Chapter 6: Power After searching for hours, the nightmares were once again in the control room, waiting for orders. \"Is everyone here?\" Dana asked. The nightmares looked around but couldn't tell if anyone was missing. There are too many of them. \"I have an idea!\" Holden exclaimed, \"I found a whiteboard with some of the creatures' names scribbled on it. I think the names belong to the creatures that can be summoned to kill us.\" As he said the last bit, the scholar gave the scientists a death glare. \"Anyways, we can divide these creatures into two groups. The first group will be the 'whiteboard group', or 'White' for short. The second group will be the 'non-whiteboard group', or 'Black' for short. And before you ask the question \"Why does the non-whiteboard group have the color black?\" it is because black is the opposite of white and non-whiteboard is the opposite of whiteboard. Any questions?\" Okami raised her hand. \" Which groups do Tsuna and I go into? \" \"Easy! You will go into the White group and your friend will go into the Black group. Both of you will be the leaders of your separate groups when we can't. Now, Black will go to the right side of the room and White will go to the left.\" The nightmares did as they were told. \"That's much better! Now see if everyone is here. White can use the whiteboard as a reference.\" The Black group was done before the White group. \" No nightmares missing from this group. \" Tsuna pointed out. The White group looked more stressed than anything else. \" We are missing two nightmares. \" Okami said as she walked over to the whiteboard and started to checkmark every name. Every name except for two. The two names with the letter \"X\" by them were \"Hell Lord\" and \"Kevin\". \"Has anyone seen those two before they went missing?\" Dana asked. The Sugarplum Fairy raised her hand. \" I saw them walking towards the elevator that goes up to the cabin. They were talking about looking for the intruder in the cabin and woods. \" \"Damn it! White, all of you head up to the cabin with Dana, Marty, Holden, Jules, and I. We will need your assistance in beating these assholes up.\" Curt was already at the door to the hallway as he said this. Okami nodded. \" You five should use the main elevator. I highly doubt that we can all fit within that elevator. But don't worry; we know other ways to get to the outside world. \" She turned towards her mini army. \" We should all turn into our human form so if there were tourists, they will only see humans instead of monsters. From what I learned about humans, they do not like the concept of things from their nightmares coming out of the ground. \" The nightmares turned from being monsters of man's imagination into \"cute, innocent little girls\". I mean, c'mon, who will be terrified of little girls. The five archetypes ran towards the main elevator and the nightmares/girls ran to someplace else. The archetypes reached the cabin first since there are fewer of them compared to the 35 nightmares. They looked through the rooms of the cabin until Dana went to the front door leading to the outside world. It was left ajar and on the ground was a ball of some sort and a piece of cloth right next to it. \"Guys! I think I found something.\" She cried out. She picked the ball and cloth off the floor as the other four came running to the door, eager to see what she found. Her eyes widened. \"T-this ball b-belongs to the Hell Lord. He w-would never just leave it.\" \"Let's see if we can find the demon nearby.\" Marty said, trying to give his friends hope that nothing has happened to the nightmares. They walked outside and saw that the girls had already beaten them to the outside. Okami walked over to Dana and held out a knife. \" This knife belongs to Kevin. \" Okami added helpfully. Dana also held out their findings. \"From what I remember, the Hell Lord always had this puzzle ball in his hands. Am I right?\" Okami sadly nodded. \" It looks like we will have to find them. I have a hunch that the intruder who shot the wraith has come and taken away both Kevin and the Fornicus. \" She took the piece of cloth away from Dana and through it on the ground. She turned into a wolf once again and sniffed the cloth. \" I smell Kevin, Fornicus and another scent that belongs to no one here. Werewolf, you smell it too so we have two noses sniffing out our comrades. \" After the two wolves had sniffed the cloth, they turned to the five teenagers. \" You should come with us. \" Okami told them. \" We may need you there if we get into a bit of a jam and you can call for backup. For now, you should climb on our back so you don't get too far behind. I don't think the gods have revived that thunder machine of yours so you have no fast transportation. \" \"By 'thunder machine', do you guys mean 'car'?\" Marty asked. The nightmares, now turned into their true forms, nodded. \"Well then, I call dibs on the unicorn!\" The three of the archetypes rolled their eyes at Marty's remark but Dana was trying so hard not to laugh. Okami shook her head. \" Humans are so strange. \" So the archetypes chose what nightmare they will ride. Marty, like he said, chose the unicorn. Dana chose Okami, Jules chose the Dragonbat, Holden chose the giant snake, and finally Curt chose the werewolf. The wolves took another couple of sniffs before running through the forest with the other nightmares behind them. After being\"used\", Fornicus and Kevin were still put through some horrible torture. They were both put in separate containers filled with some sort of water. Kevin snorkel of some kind strapped to his head so he could breath. Fornicus had a different kind of snorkel so it wouldn't get caught on one of his three saws. There were many wires connecting to both of their bodies and the boss would push a button that would shock both of them and release different chemicals into the water. This experiment was made to see what things would cause the ultimate pain to a monster's body. After many hours of this torture, the boss finally found the answer. When he released the same chemical that the darts were made of and he shocked the bodies, both nightmares eyes widened. It become very difficult to breathe and blood was trickling down Kevin's nose. They were both very close to fainting. The boss pressed the \"Filter\" button which filtered the chemical out of the water. It took a few minutes for the nightmares' breathing to go back to normal. A man came up behind the boss. \"Boss, we set up the trap. Also, our machines detected around 35 monsters coming this way.\" The boss smiled. \"Put this chemical and wires into the trap, I want to see this resolution in action.\" The nightmares finally reached the gates of a large mansion. There were no guards anywhere and that alone put them on edge. Someone who lives in a nice place like this has to have guards somewhere. The nightmares easily got passed the gate and slowly approached the mansion's doors. They left the teenagers outside of the gate with a walk-talky, or as Okami put it, a \"potable talky- thingy\". The shapeshifter explained that if any of the nightmares were in trouble, they can talk through the walky-talky using \"magical powers that humans will never understand\". The garden was quite lush with many kinds of flowers and grass. The mansion, itself, was white with golden window sills and the door was also golden. Okami had one of the Dolls open the door for her and once it was open wide enough, the nightmares stalked in. The room was huge. There was a large door across from the nightmares, but it appeared to be sealed shut. A window was above the sealed door and, when all the nightmares were inside the room, they could see who was behind it. The door they had just come in through quickly shut and sealed itself like the large door. \" Who are you?! What did you do to Fornicas and Kevin?! \" A fat man appeared with a sly grin. \"I will tell you if you can get out of my trap.\" The nightmares saw water coming out of the cracks in the walls but they didn't quite understand the situation they were in. Not until the water touched them. Okami growled. \" What the fuck is this?! \" \"Its water with some…chemicals mixed in.\" The doors would not open no matter how hard the nightmares pushed. When the water had reached past the knees for most monsters, the man added the wires. If the chemicals weren't enough to monsters faint, the extra shock was. With a final roar, the nightmares collapsed as one. Okami noticed black dots were speckling her vision. Gods, help us! The boss was quite pleased by all this. Not only did he take out half of the monsters, he also got 35 new specimens to test upon. He heard knocking on the still sealed door. He smirked. It looks like there are some humans with the monsters. He simply ignored the knocking. Okami woke up. She was on a misty plain and standing in front of her was another white wolf with its back turned to her. It seems you are very close to dying. The other wolf said. \" Who are you? Where am I? Okami asked. I am you and we are in your mind. Don't worry, though, the rest of your monster friends are having this same experience as we speak. \" The wolf turned around and Okami gasped. This wolf looks exactly like her except that it had no eyes. Instead, blood was running out of the wolf's empty eye sockets and staining the snow white fur. The gods may have given you some powers but I will open up your true power. The wolf walked up to Okami and placed its muzzle against her ear. It whispered something into Okami's ear that she couldn't understand. It was in a very old language that may rival with the age of the gods themselves. When the wolf pulled away, Okami dropped to the ground. Okami woke up again but this time she was back in the room with the chemicals. Surprisingly, the water did not hurt her. One by one, the nightmares rose and also noticed how the water wasn't painful to walk in. The door that closed on them suddenly swung open and the Black group was there. They had heard from the teenagers that the White group was in panic mode and altogether, the organization managed to knock the door down. Tsuna ran up to Okami and embraced her. \" Are you alri- \"Tsuna stopped when she saw Okami's eyes. They were always golden in color but now, they were an ocean blue. She looked around and noticed all of the nightmares from the whiteboard now have something about them that's glowing blue. \" What happened!? H-h-how did this- \"Okami shook her head. \" We will explain, later. But now, we have to fight. \" Tsuna couldn't argue with that. \"How do you expect us to get through that door!? It took us forever opening this door and I bet it would take us an eternity to open that!\" Sitterson argued. He was right, how DO they get in. \" Let us take care of it. \" Everyone stepped aside as the White team walked up to the giant door. They all chanted something nobody but the gods could understand. The team started to glow icy-blue and Okami growled. Her growling became more intense and when it did, the door started to bend. Finally, she let out a roar that shook the whole building and the door came crashing down. Afterwards, nobody said anything. They were too shocked by how the door fell. Okami and the rest of her team were too exhausted to say anything. Tsuna was the first to speak. \" The way it fell. It looked a lot like a tsunami. \" Okami laughed at Tsuna's comment. \" That's because we control water. Look, I'll explain this later. Let's save our comrades. \" Okami and the White team ran out the door and followed by that, human screams. Tsuna turned to the rest of the Organization and talked to them over the screaming. \" You humans should stay outside. It will get quite gory in here and all of you can easily get killed. Either by the mafia or by one of us going on a rampage. \" Before any of the humans could argue with the Diclonii, she and her team were out the door, followed by more gunshot and human screaming. \"Doesn't this bring back some memories?\" Dana asked Sitterson and Hadley, as if to torment them. \"Shut up already.\" Hadley grumbled. \"Well you got to see your merman.\" Dana added with a smirk. \"Yeah, until it killed me!\" Dana laughed and ran out the door they came through with Hadley following her at a slower pace. The rest of the humans left through the same door to wait outside. Okami, with the help of her team, managed to get to the control room the boss was in when they fainted. The Giant knock down the door leading to the control room and Okami was the first one in. There, they found the boss with a gun pointing at them. \"Well, well, it seems you managed to get out without me noticing. This is where you will lose. They bullets within this gun are laced with the same chemicals that were in water.\" As if an example, the boss shot at the Clown. The Clown giggled but nothing more. Now the boss was freaking out, talking rapidly in Spanish to another guy that was in the room. Okami decided to let her darker side, the one from the misty plains, to explain because even she does not know why they are like this. Pathetic human! We made them like this. Those chemicals are useless now and they are immune to electricity. I was going to make this body kill you for me, but I think my brethren have other ideas. She turned to the doorway to find both Kevin and Fornicus there, fully clothed and cuts all over as if they had broken through glass. Okami nodded her head towards the boss and his \"little helper\". The two nightmares understood what the wolf was saying. \" Our pleasure. \" Okami left with the rest of the team and after a couple minutes they could hear screaming from the room. \" Sounds like they're having fun. \" The wolf chuckled. When the whole mansion was littered with mafia corpses, the White team walked out. \"So, no more mafia boss?\" Dana asked. Okami simply shrugged as best as a wolf can. \" I guess. No body can say for certain. There may be more of them somewhere else, but we will be ready when they come. \" Marty raised his hand. \" Yes, Fool? \" \"Can we go back now? I'm starving and I hadn't eaten since we came back from the dead.\" Okami huffed, which is a sigh in wolf language. \" Fine. \" The humans got in their cars and drove off with the nightmares running at amazing speeds right beside them. A/N: THIS IS NOT THE END! I will be making a spin-off series called \"Cabin Misadventures\". There will be both funny situations and horrific situations. Most \"Episodes\" will be put into multiple chapters but I will let you know if the Episode will continue in other chapters. ","Summary":" My Version of Cabin in the Woods Prologue Before I start, this is what I think cabin in the woods s"},{"Movie":"Starship Troopers","Title":"Neo Wars: K-9 Unit 7","Author":"Christopher K.C","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11107433","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Two clicks out. Quadrant C. Approximate posit X-ray X-ray 112\". My eyes roamed the map, locating the coordinates the radioman had just spurted out to me. Couldn't even be bothered to look up from his screen. Not that I needed, nor really even wanted him to. I hated the way a radioman's bionic eyes looked. Granted, there was no other way for them to perform there complex jobs, but I couldn't get over their electric blue gaze. Something about not having pupils offended my sensibilities. I heard some radiomen got so used to them that even after their term was up and they had earned their franchise, they opted to keep the bionics instead of the nice lab created eyes they could get, free of charge of course. Ironic really considering I was attached to K-9 Unit 7, the Wiley Wolves . How a man who shares a symbiotic relationship to a bionically engineered German shepherd could be uncomfortable around a man with electronic eyes will forever remain one of life's great mysteries. Finding what I was looking for on the map I snapped a none too sharp salute. \"Quadrant C, X-ray X-ray 112 aye sir. Standing by to commence patrol.\" \"Commence\", the radioman responded, not so much as looking up from his screen. I made my way out of the prefabricated command post into what would have been considered a perfect spring morning back on earth. Here on Peroria it was considered pretty much the same thing, only with the entire landscape cast in sharp shades of violet. The pre-brief had something about reverse photosynthesis and oxidation. I knew I could safely breathe the air and be outside in my normal scout suit without being overly hot or cold which was good enough for me. My Neo, Kate, was waiting for me outside the tent. \"What is wrong\" she said, looking up at me with her intelligent brown eyes. Her own loping trot easily matched mine, scouting suit and all. \"You know how much I hate this place\" I said under my breath. She snorted, though a casual passerby would have taken it for a sneeze. Kate knew my feelings, knew that I wanted to be on the front lines, putting our training to use instead of running these boring scouting missions that amounted to no more than busy work. She put her powerfully muscled body between the armory and myself. She rose in what was a beautifully controlled ascent for an animal who normally works on all fours and placing a paw on each shoulder looked into my eyes. I was always amazed by the depth of intelligence I saw in those eyes. I never regretted joining the 9's. \"We do work\", she stated simply, and this I could not argue. At the end of the day we do what we do because the federation asks it of us. That's enough. It has to be. The service wasn't forced upon you. It was something you had to want. Anyone could serve their two years doing some menial labor and earn their franchise. Some thing's such as, pilot training, mobile infantry, and of course the K-9 units required more dedication. It took almost two years just to match a handler with their Neo and train them up. We served a minimum six year term. I wasn't worried about being a citizen. I could care less whether or not I was able to vote. I wanted a Neo, wanted to belong in that elite group. It took a special kind of man or woman to be a in the K-9 unit, to take on the burden of the symbiotic relationship that would develop between a handler and there Neo. A Neo was altered, changed, made into more than any dog would ever have evolved into. They were six times as smart as an ordinary dog, could speak, and were possessed of amazing strength and reflexes. Kate's shoulder came almost to my chest when I wasn't suited up. Her mouth could have fit my entire head with room to spare, and she could easily snap a human bone with her powerful jaws. She was faster, stronger, and more intelligent than any animal that had yet been discovered. She looked a lot like a giant German shepherd, with the same coloring and markings that identified her less evolved kin. She had Bionic implants in her eyes and ears which were thankfully not as obvious as say, I don't know, a radioman's. She was my partner, more than a dog or even a friend, and only slightly less than a lover, though I did love her, and she I. My only true fear in this world was something happening to her. The first thing they do with prospective handler candidates is to make them observe a handler who has recently lost their Neo. It's terrifying, sobering, and hauntingly beautiful, all at once. I couldn't do it. I had told them I could, I had to in order to move through the program but in my heart of hearts I knew when Kate bought it, I wouldn't be far behind.[Chapter 2] \"KATE\"! Her name was ripped from my lips so forcefully it was visceral. The last of the dirt clods hit the ground around me, smoke still softly drifting from the crater where I had been standing five seconds earlier. \"Shit, shit, shit\". I looked around. I could feel her, knew she was still alive but that was it. The relationship you develop with your Neo is on a truly subconscious level and it gears more towards your Neo than yourself. It was meant to allow the Neo to instantly respond to their handlers thoughts before a command was even necessary. The info I got back was minimal, and right now I was terrified because all I knew was Kate was alive. We were on what should have been a normal boring patrol on a planet where nothing happens so why had I just taken incoming fire from a damn Thelpot. The Thelpot's, allies of the Skinnies, hadn't even been seen in this damn sector. My suit had alerted me to the incoming pulse rocket moments before it hit, and I had barely had time to shove Kate hard and dive behind a patch of what passed for scrub brush on this planet. As I came out of my roll though, Kate wasn't in my line of sight and I had no idea what was going on or why I had been fired upon. Using the circuit selector built into my scout suit, I bit down twice in quick succession to bring up the all hands emergency circuit. \"Command, Command, Command, this is Scout Echo Whiskey One. I am under attack coordinates 39.0.01 tack -74.31.52\". I repeated the command as I reached for my scout rifle and checked my HUD to see if I could get a location on Kate. She was located back in the direction of the crater, but that didn't make sense as I knew I had pushed her, not all to gently, specifically to clear her out from the area. I bit down once hard to bring up Kate's direct circuit. \"Neo one one Zulu. Do you read? Damnit Kate answer me\". Stark silence was my only reply. The brush I was hunkered down behind, like everything else on this planet, was an awful shade of violet. I chanced a quick glance over the top of the plant to try to pinpoint the location of the Thelpot warrior I had seen, knowing it wouldn't stay still for long. There it was two clicks out and moving towards a low cluster of hills. I quickly sighted along my rifle and fired a shot. Its quick gait was brought to an immediate halt and I did a quick survey of the surrounding area, knowing it wouldn't be going anywhere soon, not with its spinal cord severed. I noted nothing else in the area and launched myself quickly back towards the crater, albeit more controlled than when I had left. Mid jump my helmet chirped and I went back over to my all hands comm circuit just in time to hear the tail end of a message \"… report status, MI in route to your position\". As I slowly drifted down to the crater, I immediately spotted Kate and realized why she hadn't responded.[Chapter 3] You never forget the first time you meet your Neo. You don't even get to the point where it's a possibility until you have gone through 2 years of intense physical training and mental and physiological testing. Those boys in the MI think they have it rough, and I'll give it to them, they do. Ask a scout though and they will tell you it's nothing compared to our training pipeline. I'll put it to you this way, if you fail out of NEO pairing, you are guaranteed a spot in the MI unless you choose to wash out, which is also an option. Before you are even considered for NEO pairing you have to have completed scout training. Not all scouts pair with a NEO, but no one who is not a scout is allowed to even attempt to pair. It doesn't take the training to pair, that's done at such a low functioning level that just about anyone has the potential to pair, but once a NEO pairs that's it, they can't be paired again and the only way to sever the pairing is in death. The instructors used to tell us a horror story, though they claimed it was true, about one of the NEO maintainers who brought his kid onsite to see a NEO puppy. Now of course both the parent and his kid were supposed to be wearing neural blockers which stop the subconscious low level brain waves from emanating which is supposed to effectively stop a pairing. Of course the kids had his turned off and low and behold he paired to a brand new adorable NEO puppy. The puppy was of course immediately euthanized before any real bond was established but apparently no one realized what effect that would have on a child. The seven year old was found dead in his room a few days later of an apparent suicide. His young mind just couldn't handle the severing. We always liked to believe it was just a ghost story meant to scare us, but I later came to find out that not only was it true, but in fact the boy's father had also killed himself not long after his son's death, consumed by guilt at the loss of his child. They instituted a few new rules after that. We are broken down into groups, and for 72 hours they PT us, pushups, running, hand to hand combat, anything to wear us down. They also give us little food, next to no sleep, and give us written exams. Technically this is so they can weed out anyone who has slipped through the cracks, but usually everyone passes as those who couldn't hack the physicality and mind games dropped out months ago. The point is to get our minds to a weakened state in which they become the most receptive they possibly can be. Then and only then do they bring all of the candidates into a room, put us at attention and we wait. That's it simply wait. Then it happens in an instant. I felt something, it's hard to describe initially, a presence in my mind that wasn't my own. It was scared, hungry, and it wanted, no NEEDED me for comfort. I remember closing my eyes, and suddenly hearing a wailing and a loud thump. I opened my eyes, shocked to think someone in the room had broken ranks, only to realize the wailing came from my own mouth, and the pounding noise was me frantically beating my fist against the steel walls, trying to escape the room, to find the other part of me, help it, give it what it needed. The crazy part about all this is it happens at different times for everyone. The NEO's are kept in the room next door, and they are puppies, who have also been put through the ringer for 72 hours to ensure their minds to are receptive. Only they are babies, who are scared and confused. This is it, the critical juncture. In this state the brain waves of a puppy and a candidate will match, coalesce, and the two will pair. Like I said, the thing is, it is not instantaneous for everyone and not everyone will pair. The general timeframe is 2 hours, if you don't pair in two hours, you are pulled and given another attempt in the future, your second and only chance. In that two hours however those who have paired are left, frantic trying to get to their NEO, responding in a primal way to the pairing, as would anyone in such a physical and mental state. I was the first to pair, and by the time they pulled those who hadn't paired by the two hour mark, my hands were bloodied. Finally once the only ones in the room are those who have paired, a small door is opened and the NEO's rush in to find there partner. Puppies came rushing in to the room, frantically yipping moving toward their partners as if by magic. Kate leapt into my arms before I could even process that she was really there, and I simply held her sobbing for what felt like hours, reveling in the sense of love and wonder, feeling complete as I hadn't before in my 21 years on earth. At some point an instructor had come in, I hadn't as I alternated between sobbing and burying my face in Kate's fur. Suddenly his voice was in my ear, and it wasn't the harsh voice I was accustomed to, but soft, full of compassion and understanding. \"Your job is to love and protect her, and her you. You keep nothing from each other. You are not two separate entities but two sides of the same coin. She will always answer you, and you will always answer her\". His voice took on a gravely edge, as if he was talking through a throat whose ability to speak was impaired. \"On the day she doesn't answer, you pray boy, you hear me you pray to God that you can save her or that you can bleed out by her side, and get one last gaze into her eyes as you go\". It wasn't until much later I realized the instructor speaking to me was none other than Colonel Duskin, the CO of the base, who had basically been medically retired to desk duty after losing his NEO on Klendathu. Kate wasn't dead, that much I knew, but it was obvious to me she was unconscious. The only thing I wasn't sure of was whether the Thelpot standing over her had knocked her out in a fight, or whether he had simply lucked upon her as she investigated the crater. Either way I knew her breathing remained steady only as long as the Thelpot kept its finger off the trigger of the weapon currently pointed at Kates head.[Chapter 4] I had never been a praying man, but this seemed like a good a time as any to find some sort, any sort, of religion. I offered up a quick prayer, to anything and anyone that was willing to listen. Keeping my rifle pointed down, I and the Thelpot stood, eyes locked on each other, neither moving a muscle. It was a good old-fashioned standoff, like from grandpa's westerns, and in my adrenaline-fueled state I barely repressed the urge to scream yeehaw. I wanted to giggle hysterically. I wanted to puke. Thelpots are ugly sons of bitches. There really is no other way to put it. They are short and squat, owing mostly to the fact that their planets gravitational pull is nearly three times that of earth. Vaguely humanoid, with two arms and legs, they have a vestigial tail which often measures around one foot in length. There skin is often a dusky yellow but can range from piss yellow to a light tan. They rarely stand taller than four feet, but they are some of the densest beings in the universe. At 3'10 they can weigh 375 pounds and it is all muscle. A Thelpot has comparable strength to a scout in his or her suit, though they are still no match for MI suits. They are surprisingly quick and agile for their weight and are by no means a race to be taken lightly. The Thelpots coal black eyes roamed over and around me, obviously attempting to see if I had backup. Its gaze slowly settled on my rifle and it used the hand not holding a blaster to Kate's head to indicate to me I should lay my weapon on the ground. I started to shake my head but as I did so I saw the blaster move ever so slightly closer towards Kate's head. In all honesty it probably wasn't even intentional, but for a moment my heart stopped beating and every other thought fled my mind as I thought only of protecting Kate. I slowly began to lower myself down to place my rifle on the ground and as I did so, glanced at Kate, hoping to see some sign of why she was unconscious. Had she been injured. I saw no blood. Suddenly I felt it, tickling the back of my brain. Wa… was that amusement! I peered closer at Kate and slowly her eye opened, winked at me and closed again. She was faking it. I went from relief to rage and back to relief in an instant, and then remembered an alien had its weapon pointed at my Neo and I was supposed to be in the act of surrendering my weapon. Suddenly an idea came to mind, whether mine or Kate's I still don't know. As I moved as if to place my rifle down, I suddenly instead hurled it directly at the unaware Thelpot. His moments distraction and confusion was all Kate needed. She executed a perfect leap from her prone position, catching the Thelpot's weapon in her jaws and ripping it from his grasp. He turned, obviously in surprise and so never truly had time to register the shock web I aimed at his chest. As soon as it struck he seized up and fell to the ground. Not that I saw any of this. \"BAD DOG\" I screamed as I marched towards Kate. \"YOU BAD STUPID STUPID DOG. What the hell were you thinking\"! Then I was on the ground cradling her as she attempted to curl her large mass into my arms. I started bawling like a baby and was grateful for the suit and helmet when the MI showed up minutes later. \"Scout, what the hell is going on here\" the patrol unit sergeant asked me. I stood up, setting Kate down and collecting myself before I answered. I felt I did an excellent job keeping the quaver out of my voice, but I'm also biased. \"Great question Sir, I believe we should start by asking him\" I said as I pointed to the still seizing Thelpot which had been obscured by me and my suit. Though his face was masked, I could practically see his eyes bug out. \"Shit\" was the only reply he could really muster. We both knew what it meant to find a Thelpot on the ground here. The Bugs were coming. ","Summary":" \"Two clicks out. Quadrant C. Approximate posit X-ray X-ray 112\".

You turn to your left and see five soldiers standing and shooting at both sets of creatures you the move your left arm motioning them to go backwards then you turn to your right doing the same to the other group of soldiers to go back and you follow. As you are running backwards you are suddenly pushed over you turn over only to see a soldier that had pushed you being grabbed and carried away by one of the flying creatures, you quickly get up and try to shoot the creature carrying away your comrade only to have to turn your attention to the ground creatures as they are getting to close for comfort only to look up and see a large blue ball of light falling from the sky. You turn to warn the other soldiers only for it to land where they where blasting you off your feet quickly you are helped up by a girl soldier as another with a radio on her back covers just after you are helped up you are handed back your weapon you then turn and open fire at the creatures still attacking you three, you are then suddenly knocked over as you turn back round you see one of the ground creatures raising its clawed arm and then brings it down as you raise your right arm to protect yourself only to have it removed by the claw at the elbow, before it can attack you again it's killed by the girl without the radio while the one with the radio holds up two fingers as she continues to fire at the ground type creatures You then start to shoot into them along with the other girl only then to have to look up as a ship that has come to get you arrives it circles only to be hit by a blue ball of light and explode as it falls from the sky the three of you move to get away from it only for it to explode as it hits the ground knocking you all off your feet but as you go down you see the girl with the radio get his by long metal poles in her back that then come out her chest, as you got to get back up one of the ground creatures suddenly appears and brings one of its claws down and cuts off your left leg in half as you scream in pain the other surviving girl guns it down but then a bright light blinds you and it all go's quite. Dream space ends You open your eyes and see a pod lid raising above you and a girl standing next to it, you then go to sit up but you are having to only use your left arm and from the shoulder of your right arm down there is nothing there once slightly up you then see at the pelvic part to your left leg to your left foot is also missing as you are about to move again you feel a hand on your right shoulder you turn and see a pair of orange eyes looking at you. \"Morning sis I thought you were going to sleep all week.\" said the girl chuckling You look at her then shake your head \"oh be quite grass top.\" as the green haired, orange eyed, white, five feet two inch tall girl wearing military clothing looked at you with a pout on her face \"oh be quite rabbit head Nicky, don't forget to attach your arm and leg to yourself or you won't get very far.\" \"Yar yar sure Erika.\" Nicky replies as she reaches to the very bottom of the pod she is in and picks up her robotic arm and attaches it to her right shoulder then using both arms she then picks up her robotic leg and attaches it to her left side, once done Nicky climes out of the pod and starches then turns to look at Erika how has a data pad in her hands as she looks throw the info on it Nicky asks \"What you looking at sis.\" \"Just looking through over some info and your reassignment to the Roughnecks that Hannah sent me.\" replied Erika, Nicky straightened her top and shorts that she had put on while Erika had spoke and said \"So how is egghead and what did she say.\" Erika turned to look at Nicky as she said with a frown on her face \"Your only saying that because she, me and our other sisters Zoe, Yasmin and Raven have psychic possibly me and Hannah the most.\" only for Nicky to pat her on her shoulder and say \"Only because your two are twins and Zoe, Yasmin and Raven are triplets.\" then added with a chuckle \"I had to deal with you all as you all got use to it but I feel sorry for our brother Naruto ha ha the youngest and only boy out of the seven of us.\" Erika smiled \"Well he has always looked out for us just as much as we looked out for him I'm just happy he can't join the Federation yet.\" Nicky nodded and said \"Me too although I know once he is able to join he is going to join up as an ape like me.\" Then she looked at the clock inside the room \"Well I better get going so I can get a shower before I go and meet my new Lieutenant.\" Erika nodded but then said \"Take it easy though sis I know it's nearly been three years since you was last on Pluto and with what happened, Hannah has said that if any more medical staff see you having any more problems you maybe section 8ed.\" Nicky had stopped at the door and lowered her head only to say \"I know sis and I can deal normally it's just when I sleep in one of the pods ... the dreams come back losing my whole company ... and dad at the same time you know why I asked for this reassignment and demonian to the roughnecks so just don't worry too much sis and later.\" and then she left while missing the worried look on Erika's face After her shower and getting dressed into her clean combat clothes Nicky headed to the locker deck for mobile infantry personal and collected her M-1A4 powersuit and put it on then headed to the dropship bay she entered the large hanger bay and headed to the far end ship that she knew was assigned to the Roughnecks, after reaching it she climbed a boarded and saw two fleet pilots heading to the cotpit just to the side of the door was a MI trooper with a single chevron marking him as a private but she could not see his name on the side she was looking at talking to another MI trooper but this one had a silver bar on his shoulder marking him as a lieutenant and he was also missing and arm from his elbow to his hand on his left side but she could see a name under the silver bar which said Razak on it the LT then pointed to the cotpit area and the private saluted and turned to walk into the cotpit area Nicky noticed he has a capsule picture on his back on his jetpack on the M-1A4 powersuit which was standard issue she then thought *Ok so we have a psychic in our squad.* she then walked up to the lieutenant and saluted as he turned to face her and she said \"Private Nicky Revell reporting for duty sir.\" Lieutenant Razak looked at her and said \"Last I heard you was a Lieutenant in the Screaming Eagles during Operation Pest Control.\" to which Nicky nodded and replied \"I was sir but as you no duet know about our last op on Pluto we was attacked and I only just survived it and I could not stay onboard the ship TFD Virginia because of the memories sir ... so I requested to be reassigned and demoted for what happened.\" Razak nodded to her reply then asked \"If I was to offer you a promising to a higher rank\" to which Nicky said \"I'd wish you would give it to someone else in the squad unless I was the only option sir.\" Razak nodded and said \"Very well join Jenkins in the cotpit with me till we are underway.\" Nicky saluted him again and then headed to the cotpit. She walked throw the door into the cotpit and saw the other soldier sat on one of five seats just behind where the pilots sat he turned to face her but she was able to see the name Jenkins on the side of the helmet, he then said \"Hello I'm Carl Jenkins I heard we was getting four new soldiers with me being the fifth\" Nicky replied \"Yar I'm Nicky Revell former lieutenant of the Screaming Eagles Mobile Infantry company ...Spartan squad now private of the Roughnecks Mobile Infantry\" Carl nodded then said \"I'm sorry about what happened but I've heard that there are five of you now in the Federation\" Nicky nodded and replied happily \"yar me and my sisters two joined half a year after I had enlisted they had been in service for 6 months before the end of Operation Pest Control they where my sisters Hannah and Erika they was both posted to the same unit the Silverback company, Hannah joined as a psychic while Erika joined as a medic while my other three sisters joined just before this war started they are Zoe, Yasmin and Raven, I don't know if they have been posted to any units yet but I know what they joined in Zoe joined as a fednet reporter but she got some combat training as well, Yasmin joined as a fleet pilot and Raven joined as a mechanic\" Carl nodded and asked \"Do you have any other family?\" Nicky nodded and said \"Yar I have a brother Naruto and my mum Andrea my bro is still to young to join yet but once he is he said he wants to be an ape like me so at the minute I'm happy he cannot join\" while she was talking to Carl Razak had entered and was listening to what was being said then Carl asked \"And I take it your dad was on Pluto with you\" Nicky nodded and said \"Yar but I don't want to talk about it\" she then reached into her left pocket on her belt and took out 12 dog tags and said \"These are my squads, mine and my dad's dog tags that I was able to get a month after I had recovered from my injures I carry them with me and remember what I have vowed to do after the mistake's I had done and not to repeat them\" she then reput them into her pocket As the ship finished prepping for flight Razak heard a noise coming from the back he turned and walked into the back and said \"Sergeant!\" both Nicky and Carl turned and saw two corporals stood on either side of the door and four others at the back of the bay but they couldn't see them Nicky turned to Carl and asked \"So do you know anything about our follow troopers?\" Carl nodded and said \"The sergeant and two corporals have been in the service as long or longer then you while the three private have only just joined the squad ones a fednet reporter while the other two are old class mates Dizzy Flores and Johnny Rico\" just after he said that they both then heard the shout of \"privates!\" Carl stood up and entered the back first followed by Nicky as they entered she was able to see the names and faces of the two corporals, the first was a six foot tall black American with the name Doc on his helmet the second was a six foot two inch tall white American with the name Gossard on the side of his helmet as she passed them she heard Doc turn to Gossard and say 'special op's' to which Gossard replied 'Psychic freaks' both had said it quietly to each other showing that they didn't have that high of an opinion of Psychic's she looked ahead and saw the sergeant as a six foot tall white Texan with the name Brutto on it then a five foot five inch tall white American with a camera in his hand with the name Higgins on the helmet and the last two said \"Carl\" together from what Nicky could see one was a five foot eight inch tall white female American with the name Flores on her helmet leaving the second the five foot nine inch tall white male American as Rico As Nicky stood there looking at the squad she had been placed with her memory went back and changed the face's and added more people into the ship bay she raised her hand to her head and thought *we are all going to survive this time I'm not going to be the only survivor again ... Never again* Razak then broke her thought's as he said \"Suit up you ape's prepare for drop\" then an alarm went off and everyone one ran to the combat dropsuit areas of the ship and everyone started to climb into the suit's Nicky saw Gossard puss Higgins towards his as he and Doc climbed into the marauder suits that the ship had Gossard got aboard the M-9 marauder assault suit nicknamed the 'Duck' while Doc boarded the M-8 marauder assault suit nicknamed the 'Ape' they were soon all sealed in there suit's and where ready for drop only to hear over the radio *\"Live forever ape's\"* Nicky knew it had been Razak that had said that and as one everyone replied *\"HO!\"* Then she heard a thud noise as they were all launched from the ship to the ground of Pluto. The ride down to the service of Pluto was bumpy as they got though the upper and lower atmosphere the dropsuit's glowed red hot from the heat of entry a few seconds after they stopped glowing the dropsuit's broke apart releasing the roughnecks to Pluto's gravity after a few seconds of free fall the jump jets on the back of their powersuits activated and slowed them down a lot more till they came in and gently landed on the ground of Pluto. They soon regrouped then headed east to a bowl shaped cliff with a narrow corridor heading from the very top if it to the south, they stood at the top of the cliff and repealed down to the ground as they reached the ground they turned and walked towards a structure that was in the middle of the bowl as they walked towards it Nicky started to get an uneasy feeling in her gut Razak then held up his robotic arm making the squad halt he then said \"There are two hundred scientists along with sixty-three dependants we're here to ensure the safety of these people\" Brutto how was stood next to him then flicked down his multi-spectrum visor and scanned the building for a few seconds only to say \"No movement ... If somebody's in there, there not breathing\" Nicky grimly knew the outcome from what Brutto had said Razak turned and said \"Doc, Gossard stay here keep an eye out\" \"Sir yes sir\" both said in reply Carl then said \"I scenes something\" to Rico and Dizzy to which Brutto how heard it stepped toward them and angrily said \"I said no movement\" then he turned back round and headed towards the door of the building they where to guard Higgins then said \"Maybe I could stay out here and get some exterior shot's\" Nicky saw Razak look at Higgins for a second to which she quickly said \"Don't worry LT I'll keep an eye on paperboy\" to which he nodded then he, Rico, Dizzy and Carl also headed to the building following Brutto Nicky turned back round only to hear Doc say \"Remember only get my good side\" to Higgins which made her chuckle. After a few minutes of Higgins filming the marauders and the area he turned the camera to Nicky and asked \"So Nicky have you seen the enemy before?\" Nicky turned to face him as she also noticed both Doc and Gossard had turned slightly in there marauders so they could see them both and listen she then replied \"Yar I was here during Operation Pest Control.\" The look of surprise on there was in Nicky's view very funny then Higgins said \"Wow never knew so have you always been a private?\" Nicky reply slightly happily \"No I was a Lieutenant just before the end of it\" the look of shock on their faces made her chuckle more but then she quickly said \"But a choose I made along with the Major of my unit cost everyone their lives officially we all went beyond the call of duty ... personally the guilt of being the only survivor makes me think otherwise\" she saw Higgins go to ask something only for her to add \"If you want to learn more paperboy ask me later or look for it on fednet what happened was a pretty big thing\" as Higgins went to nod in reply a big explosion happened at the rear area of the building the others had entered making them all turn to look making Nicky say \"Someone is having a party in there\" She then saw the marauders both turn towards the bottle neck opening to the south Nicky turned then saw the enemy arachnid warriors and workers forming at the main opening she raised her hand to her helmet radio only to be beaten to it by Gossard how did it first *\" LT you better come take a look at this\"* within a few seconds the other roughnecks exited the scientist base and joined Nicky and the others and watch as the warriors and workers start to roar and scream making more appear Nicky heard Rico say \"You know them story's where going to tell our kids Diz\" after quite a lot grouped together they all turned and started to charge down the corridor towards the roughnecks Razak turned and yelled \"Prepare to engage!\" they all took cover behind some boulders that was in a line Higgins still had his camera up and said \"Why aren't we retreating?\" Brutto turned to him and said \"No retreat ... No surrender\" Nicky turned to look around at the roughneck reaction's Brutto, Razak, Doc and Gossard were all calm and preparing themselves for battle she then looked at the rookies they were all nervous and trying to grasp what was about to happen. Then Rico turned to Higgins how was stood behind everyone and said \"I think you're going to want to get this on tape\" Razak then said to Doc and Gossard \"Distance\" Dizzy how was next to him said \"Distance there right here\" Gossard flicked a switch and down came a distance measure scanner came out a side panel inside his marauder and then he looked throw it and said \"500 meters\" Nicky saw Razak walking along just behind all of the roughnecks with his rifle held up resting against his shoulder as he walked behind Dizzy she said \"Let's go\" only for him to say \"Steady!\" Gossard then said \"250 meters ... 100 meters\" Rico then said as Gossard said 100 meters \"Now let's go\" only for Razak to say \"Steady!\" but then Gossard yelled out \"75 meters\" Razak then shouted \"Fire!\" and everyone opened up and ten warriors dropped cut to ribbings soon followed by the marauders how also cut down another twenty-five then Razak then yelled \"Marauders lock plasma.\" Doc said \"Lets rain on their parade\" and both of them fired two missiles each the shots landed 50 meters of them with a bright light blinding the roughnecks for a few seconds once they could see again they saw a wall of flaming plasma going from the ground to the very top of the cliffs blocking off the corridor from the bowl Razak stopped firing making the others as well they saw ten warriors try to force their way throw only to be burned to death Razak then said \"That fire gives us ten minutes to either get back up or meet up with a retrieval ship Roughnecks up the ledge.\" They ran to the end of the bowl where they had entered the bowl at the start they took out there lizard line guns from there back's and aimed at the top of the ledge and fire it hitting the top the cliff and pulled them up. After they got to the top they moved a few miles away from the cliff Razak then put his right hand to his helmet radio and said *\"Come in blue leader\"* everyone else kept an eye out for any trouble Dizzy looked around and said \"Wow\" then Rico replied \"Watching the war on TV is sure different then living it\" Nicky chuckled from what both Dizzy and Rico said Razak continued to try and contact the ship troop commander *\"Come in blue leader this is alpha team come in ... We have an R triple D situation we need back up\"* Higgins turned to Brutto and asked \"R triple D is that code?\" only for Brutto to reply \"Yar really deep do do\" Nicky chuckled and added \"They should change it to RDS\" Higgins turned to her and asked \"what does that mean\" and Nicky said \"Really deep shit.\" Brutto smirked at what Nicky said just then Blue leader spoke *\" We are unable to complying no squad available\"* Razak and everyone was shocked to which Razak then said *\"WHAT? Charlie, Delta and Echo squad where dropped in range of our position.\"* But Blue leaders reply shocked the squad *\"All squad's report R triple D we're in a crisis situation will send retrieval at earliest availability\"* Higgins laughed at that and said \"ha ha like we need him to tell us that.\" Razak then said \"The bugs were waiting ... Planning for us.\" Brutto shook his head and said \"bug's got no brains\" only for Jenkins to then say \"It don't mean they don't have some type of intelligence somewhere out there\" Nicky turned to Razak and said \"LT we should head to a more secure and defence able area\" Razak looked around the area and was about to give an order only for Gossard to interrupt and say \"LT company's coming\" Razak turned to him and said \"Who?\" \"Indeterminate mobile mass ... family size\" The ground a few meters in front of them started to shake and move and then crack and give way allowing a giant fat round bug to climb out of the ground it roar as it finally got out of the ground and splaying a jest of fire into the air from the two tubes on the side of its face, they all started to back up at the sight of it as it was about the same height as a two story house and about as long as long lorry and trailer Dizzy looked at it in shock and said \"Basic training never mentioned these things\" Razak replied \"They didn't know about these\" however Nicky yelled with a look of fear on her face \"Tanker! Move!\" they all scattered the marauders used their leg jets to get out of the way as a jet of fire was lunched at where the roughnecks where stood, as the others ran out of the way the marauders landed and opened fire at the tanker bug only for the bullets to bounce off the armour of the bugs head Doc the said \"the bugs like a walnut we can't crack the shell\" the tanker turned and fired another stream of fire which impacted just in front of the marauders causing an explosion making the marauders be blown backwards and knocking them to the floor Brutto saw this and yelled out \"Marauders down\" Razak used his radio and asked *\"Doc, Gossard status?\"* Only to hear Gossard's reply *\"We're turtles\"* Razak turned to Brutto and Rico and said \"Brutto, Rico go!\" As everyone else ran to the right of the tanker bug and opened fire on it trying to draw its attention to them while the marauders where righted as they took cover behind some boulder's as Razak then asked Nicky \"Ok private Nicky do you have any info on this bug?\" as they all continued to shoot at the tanker only for the rounds to bounce off the armour Nicky replied \"Yes sir as you have seen it fires balls or streams of flame's from the tubes on the side of its face standard ammo just bounce off it while armour piercing or rockets can take this thing out\" only for the tanker to fire at them with its stream of fire hitting just in front of the cover they was using making them all duck behind them just then they hear Brutto over the radio call out *\"Inbound\"* causing everyone to look up and see a retrieval ship coming in to land Dizzy then said \"We are so out of here\" as they move to where the ship is going to land the upright and moving marauder suits quickly joined them and prepare to cover them only to watch as a stream of fire to hit the side of the ship and another to hit near where it was going to land the landing legs of the ship that was lowered to do with it landing then started to re-enter the body of the ship as it started to raise back up into the air and them it started to move away Dizzy shouted out \"Wait!\" like the pilots could hear her Rico then said \"what are they just going to leave us here?\" before anyone could reply Doc shouted out \"Incoming!\" They all started to run when a fire ball impacted just behind them launching them all forward except the marauders throwing them all a few feet forward after them landed on their chests as they all started to get up the ground under Carl and Dizzy started to crack and then it gave way making them slide down a passage way which dumped them a few feet way into a trench which was in front of the tanker bug. It turned towards them and then started to head to them Rico saw this making him run towards the cliff that ran along the trench which lucky was the same height as the bug he ran along the edge of it to try and get in front of the bug Razak saw this and yelled \"Rico fall back!\" to which he didn't listen Razak yelled again \"I said fall back!\" only for Rico to not only not listen again and then to run and jump onto the back of the head of the tanker bug as it roared in anger Nicky then saw him throw something small and round up trying to get it into the mouth of the bug only for it to bounce and then land on to the floor Only to hear a explosion to happen a second later making the ground crack and then give way under the weight of the tanker taking it and Rico underground Nicky was only just able to hear him yell as he fell Dizzy ran to the edge along with everyone else and yelled \"RICO!\" Doc stood next to her as he was also stood next to Razak and said \"Guess he found the tunnels\" Razak then tried to radio him *\"Rico come in ... Rico come in\"* he then turned to Carl \"Anything?\" Carl went to say something but was interrupted by Brutto how sarcastically said \"Nothing on Rico but I see a little bird coming to fly us away\" as the very same retrieval ship that was scared away at first now came into land Dizzy angrily turned to the hole and said \"We can't leave we have a man down there\" Brutto angrily answered \"Listen little lady that ape's a goner\" to which Carl calmly said \"No he's not\" Brutto pushed Carl at his shoulder and said \"Listen nutcase\" but was stopped when Razak said \"Troopers! I'm going in who's coming with me?\" Brutto looked at Razak in shock and said \"Lieutenant?\" Razak turned to him and said \"Tell the retrieval ship to wait ten minutes if we're not back by then tell them to leave\" Brutto turned to Doc and said \"The lieutenant's insane\" to which Doc replied \"Hey man we're fighting giant bug's on freaking Pluto man where all insane\" Nicky walked past them both and add \"I don't think we are Doc this is just a job\" Brutto turned to look at the retrieval ship and Higgins then he checked his rifle then headed toward where Razak was heading to, as they all got ready to enter the hole Razak then said \"Nicky, Higgins, Doc and Gossard stay here, first thing out of here is a bug blow it then evac\" Nicky, Higgins, Doc and Gossard instantly said \"SIR YES SIR\" TEN MINUTES LATER Nicky and Doc was walking to the left of the hole when they heard movement coming from it they both got ready for battle only for them to see five green helmets coming out of it Nicky then said \"Well Rico at least your hole\" and Doc chuckled as he added \"And I was hoping to blow something up\" Rico then said \"Been there\" to which Dizzy added \"Done that\" and Carl finished \"Big time\" Nicky couldn't help it but laugh Then they all heard a shout \"Private!\" Razak pushed Rico backwards and then said \"You disobeyed a direct order and all most got yourself killed that is not accepted in this squad do you get me!\" Rico looked down as he said \"Sir I get you sir\" then Razak added with a smirk \"gutsy son\" Rico smiled as they all headed to the retrieval ship Nicky smiled and thought *Guess this is going to be fun being in this squad* as she sat down onboard the ship as it soon took off to taken them back to the Valley Forge[Chapter 2] DAY 4 OF OPERATION ON PLUTO Bold font and *\"\"* – radio talk, Italic font and ** – thoughts, underline font and \"\" – TV or news reports, \"\" – normal speck, '' – whispering, and I own nothing in this story it's just an idea I had years ago Nicky sat in her section of trench line alpha of base Gamma thinking about the past few days since arriving back on Pluto after Operation Pest Control and the worried messages she would get from her sister Erika she knew that her other sisters were also worried but knew she would be ok, although up to date both Erika, Hannah and Zoe still didn't know what unit they were going to be put in mainly from Hannah's and Erika's old unit being scraped due to the shock of this operation and the Bugs being back plus the combat that allowed the SICON forces to place the seven bases that now cover Pluto with base Gamma being the newest and while the other bases had walls and defence towers that could defend the base very well this one had to settle for trenches while they got the base up and running not that it helped the troopers in them from the constant attacks but warriors and worker Arachnids how mostly just either ran around or straight into the trench's, so far over the two days the Roughnecks had been posted to the base defence of Gamma base they had to defend against twenty attacks with fifteen troop's paying for it with their lives and another fifty being wounded today a squadron of Marauders have been added to the squads to help defend the area even now she could hear the zipper noise of the mini guns from the marauder guns fighting at the bugs She then turned to her right and saw the soldier just a few feet from her stand to look what was going on only to raise his morita rifle and yell \"One got throw\" and then a warrior arachnid appeared knocking him down and stabbing him in the chest with one of its front legs making him cry out in pain Nicky was up and was about to fire when someone else opened fire hitting and killing the bug Nicky looked to her left and saw it had been Razak and next to him was Doc, Rico and Jenkins he turned to them and said \"Perimeter defence on the double.\" They quickly say \"SIR YES SIR\" and head off to the main line trench while he was giving the order to them Nicky had rushed to the downed trooper and cut off the leg that was in the body of the trooper to keep it as air tight as possible while she tried to stable him to be moved just then two other troopers rushed to her carrying a stretcher to help take him back to the base Razak walked up to her and said \"How is he private?\" Nicky replied as he was being placed onto the stretcher by the others \"Don't know sir it'll be touch and go till he gets back to base\" as he was then picked up and taken back Razak turned to her and said \"Head back with him and get me a report and file one on what happened too.\" Nicky nodded and saluted him as she followed the stretcher bearers back Arriving back at the Gamma headquarters main building she entered the air sealed base and then headed to the main admin area to fill out a report and then headed to one of the many bathrooms on base and quickly washed off the blood that was on her hands and then she started to take calming breaths to calm herself down she then said to herself after getting it all off and drying her hands \"Stupid sodding phobia every time I really need to get over this phobia\" \"I agree sis you do need to get over your fear.\" replied someone stood behind Nicky not that she needed to turn and see how it was \"Mental blocks don't work and remember only you can get in my head egghead and even then even you have said it was head getting in.\" Hannah looked at her sister and asked \"same images?\" Nicky replied sarcastically while still not turning round \"Yar different types of arachnids dressed in tutu's doing the caramindancen dance.\" Hannah growled in annoyance and went to speak only for Nicky to interrupt and said \"I know you don't have to say anything I'm fine ... do you know what unit you are being assigned to yet?\" as she finally turned to face her sister looking at her five foot tall the smallest of the family wearing military uniform with corporal rankings on her shoulders and collar leading up to her freckle covered face with a large deep scar going across her face from the bottom of her left cheek near her jaw straight across it then up to her left blue eye then along her nose to her right red eye then up to her black coloured hair \"Not yet I do know that me and Erika will be in the same squad again\" replied Hannah as Nicky started to walk to leave the room Hannah put her hand on Nicky's shoulder and stopped her and said \"You need to let go sis you have punished yourself enough as it is everyone else knows you all did your best and the families and them you recued know it and so do we sis why can't you let it go?\" Nicky pulled out her dog tags one pair had the Roughnecks logo on it while the other pair had a eagle on it and it said ^Screaming Eagles^ on it \"If these didn't remind me of the cost.\" She then reached into her pocket and to out the dog tags and held them in her robotic arm \"my arm, leg and these sure do, my squad, our dad and the whole battalion all for some bug Intel wanted and leaving us high and dry.\" And then she added as she left \"I have a debt to repay and nothing anyone says will ever make me forget till it's paid.\" Hannah turned as Nicky left and said \"I thought I told you it don't matter surviving is your debt being paid your my sister you don't owe me nothing\" but Nicky left then headed to check up on the injured trooper that was brought in then she headed back out to head to the main trench line to report to Razak Ten minutes later Nicky arrived back at the frontline and saw Razak talking to the others in the Roughnecks as another unit was taking up there firing positions she walked up to him and saluted and said \"Sir filled in a report and the trooper was stable in medic bay when I left but it's unclear how long it's going to be before he can re-join his unit.\" Razak nodded and replied \"Thanks for the update private now get your gear ready and more ammo we have a mission to start\" Nicky nodded then quickly headed towards her post only to be stopped by Higgins how held up her bag, she took it off him and quickly checked it before saying \"Thanks paperboy guess I just need to get more ammo\" she quickly went to a nearby ammo case and collected what ammo magazines she needed then she rejoined the squad Razak then turned and said \"ok Roughnecks we have been ordered to sector seven quad seventeen for a little bug hunt Intel believe that there's a pass not too far from here where the bugs form up into their raiding party's to attack Gamma base we are being sent with Ape platoon to clear it Doc regression a Ape marauder we leave in five.\" everyone quickly said \"SIR YES SIR.\" and moved out. LATER After arriving in the sector and quad they had been assigned to the Roughnecks gathered around Razak for orders he then said \"split off into groups with a Ape platoon squad, Gossard, Rico Higgins and Nicky head east with squad one and make a fire line between the ledges there and kill anything with more than two legs, Doc and Jenkins link up with squad's two and three and head to the right myself, Brutto and Dizzy and with squad four we will head left and we'll flush the bugs towards the rest of you.\" they all replied \"SIR YES SIR.\" and they all split into their groups and joined the squads they was told to join As the other squads left to their positions as they formed a line in between two ledges with a small cliff on their right as Nicky, Gossard and Rico got into a line along with the squad members of first squad with Higgins stood behind them with his camera up to record the coming battle as everyone spread out slightly to keep an eye out for the incoming bugs Higgins then turned to Nicky how he was near and asked \"I know we have met the enemy but what have you seen them do?\" Nicky turned to look at Higgins and said \"I've seen them build quite a few things but while it may be amazing but the amount of people these dam creatures have killed do's not mean what they make matter to all the men and women, friends.\" Nicky had to pause then added \"... and relatives that they have killed ever since the first time we first met them.\" As Higgins went to say something only to hear the scream of an arachnid as everyone got into their battle line the and soon saw a pack of twenty warriors charging towards their position the sergeant of Ape squad one yelled out \"Get ready Ape's and get ready to kill all these pests!\" \"OH!\" shouted out everyone Nicky looked around and saw everyone was ready when she then quickly said \"Sarge if everyone aims for the centre nerve stem of the warriors we'll kill them quicker.\" The sergeant nodded and said \"You heard her Ape's!\" as they all aimed and as the warriors got to within one hundred meters of them and then the sergeant yelled out \"FIRE!\" and five warriors collapsed Gossard then took a grenade off his belt pulled the pin then throw it into a large group heading the left where the explosion killed another three he was soon followed by Rico and Nicky how did the same and also where able to kill another three each and with the other troops killed the last six by gunning them down Gossard then got on his radio to call it in as everyone spread out to check the dead bugs the Ape squad troopers headed a bit away from their battle line as a retrieval ship while they did that Higgins how was filming everything panned his camera to the small cliff near to the right ledge as he did so a wounded warrior appeared and screamed at him as it jumped at him he was tackled out of the way by Rico getting both of them out of the way allowing Nicky and Gossard to gun it down ending its life Rico turned to Higgins and asked \"You whole?\" Higgins nodded as he said \"Yar.\" Then he turned to where Gossard and Nicky where stood and asked \"And wasn't you cutting it a little to close?\" to which Gossard replied \"I could of taken it earlier but I thought you would of wanted a close up for the Fednet nightly news\" Nicky shook her head as she then put her hand to her helmet radio and radioed Razak * \"LT area cleaned all bugs killed with no casualties at all\"* Razak replied * \"Acknowledged Doc has radioed that they are also clean and are heading to your position our area is also clean so we'll be regrouping there\"* Nicky replied * \"Sir\"* Nicky then checked her ammo counter on her morita and saw she only had half a clip left so she unloaded and placed it in her back ammo pouch and got a full clip from her right leg pouch, she then saw Ape squads two and three arrived and then Jenkins and Doc in his marauder as they joined Nicky and the others Carl went and talked to Rico while Doc got out of his marauder and Nicky saw damage to its armour as well as bug blood all over it Nicky then said \"Hey Doc decided to just use your suit in melee combat instead of using the mini guns on your suit.\" Doc smirked at her and replied \"True but there was quite a few more in our area and we had to improvise.\" \"Well at least you was able to improvise Doc\" said Nicky Just then she heard \"Hey guys!\" she turned and saw Dizzy slid down the left ledge and joined them standing next to Rico and Carl and they all noticed her power suit was covered from head to toe in bug blood and guts Gossard walked up to them and after seeing Dizzy then said \"Nothing like a bug hunt to get your juices flowing.\" Gossard then said while shaking his head \"Man what do you do to relax Flores? Bunge jump without the cord\" Dizzy chuckled as she said \"Hey no guts no glory\" to which Rico replied \"No brains.\" And Carl added \"No kidding.\" Dizzy shook her head as they said that with a smile Razak then walked towards them and said \"Heads up Roughnecks new orders from command, we are to head to the south-western quadrant check your rig's.\" as everyone started to check there gear Nicky chuckled and said \"Oh goodie another bug hunt.\" Carl then said \"Hope you brought sun cream it's a bomby one thousand nine hundred and fifty degrees below down south.\" Rico was about to say something to Carl when all their radios went off * \"This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez of the Federal fleet this is an emergency.\"* \"Hur?\" said Nicky, Rico then said \"Carmen?\" Dizzy then said \"What's the prom queen doing in bug country.\" Razak then replied * \"we read you Lieutenant Ibanez.\"* there was a pause then another voice was heard * \"This is Major Zander Barkalow my ship was downed by enemy fire our position is the Mc Henry outpost in sector seven in quad eighteen, two military personal and seven civilians warriors guard the perimeter we request immediate evac.\"* Dizzy then said to Carl and Rico quietly 'oh great what are the odds the prom queen hanging out with the football hero' Razak then replied * \"affirmative Major Barklow alpha team have your position locked and are responding.\"* but what was replied from the fleet pilot shocked the Roughnecks but not Nicky * \"Thank you Lieutenant Razak but my call is for an evac by a Fleet retrieval ship not an MI ground squad please relay message.\"* came the arrogant reply from Barklow *it never changes the arrogance of Fleet pilot's to the MI trooper life's same as dam Intel personal.* thought Nicky as she had a sour look on her face which was slightly noticed by Razak But then Razak then replied *\"As of 09:00 that sector has been designated a hot zone no ship is allowed to enter that quad till father notice do you read?\"* Barklow then arrogantly replied *\"Thank you lieutenant but fleet will respond for one of their premium pilot's.\"* Nicky after hearing that turned to Doc and Gossard how was next to her and chuckled as she whispered 'Yar a premium arsshole. Ha Ha.' then they all heard Razak say \"Premium horses behind.\" then he got back on the radio and replied *\"We will relay message over and out.\"* He then turned to Brutto and said \"Brutto call it in to fleet command and relay message.\" Brutto folded his arms and said \"Why should we LT he thinks fleet can do it, let him wait\" Rico how was just behind him was not happy about what he said Nicky then said \"Sir seeing as we're not far from the Mc Henry outpost we could go have a look see what is in the area and assist if need be\" Razak smirked at that and said \"very true private Doc bring the marauder with us\" 20 minutes later As they reached a cliff a mile from the outpost they could see the building and quite a lot of warriors walking around the area Gossard and Nicky how where knelt on the cliff edge watching it all, Gossard then flicked down his visitor scanner and used it to get a more detailed look around the area then after a minute he flicked it back up and turned to Razak how was stood behind them both and said \"Place crawls sir.\" Razak nodded at Gossard's replied he then heard Brutto say after getting of the radio \"Here's a big surprise fleet can't because of mucho bug activity sir.\" but what surprised them all Rico then said \"We can take them sir.\" Dizzy looked at Rico in disbelief and said \"Wow Rico how made you a hero?\" Carl also looked at Rico in knowing why Rico said what he has Razak turned as he heard Nicky say quietly to herself 'Fleet does the flying and MI does the dying same as three years ago.' she then said loudly to Razak \"LT we should see if there's any plasma bugs in the area as they are the only things that could be stopping them from coming and rescuing the civilians and fleet pilots sir.\" just after she had said that they all heard a thud sound and a rushing noise making everyone look up into the air as they saw three giant balls of plasma flying into the air coming from a mountain just a few feet behind them Razak after seeing this said \"All right Roughnecks our first priority is to make a corridor for fleet.\" Rico then said \"We have to get the civilians out sir.\" Razak turned to Rico and angrily stared at him then said to Carl \"Do you séance anything?\" Carl then got a faraway look on his face then he said \"The loading dock is not full secure sir.\" Nicky then said \"Well sir we now have a time limit to work to and I find we ape's do our best under pressure.\" They then quickly headed to the foot of the mountain from where the plasma balls came from Doc powered down the marauder suit and got out of it then stood next to Dizzy Razak then looked at them all and said \"Our objective is to clear out the plasmas surprise is the key so stay off the radio's com links only\" everyone nodded Dizzy turned and looked at the mountain and said with a smile on her face \"Piece of cake.\" Doc chuckled at that and said \"Well you can have my slice.\" Razak walked up to them and stood behind them to which Doc noticed and said \"Well what's life without a few tiny challenges.\" As Nicky laughed at what Doc had said and replied \"You sound just like my sister Zoe, she's always enjoy a good challenge.\" she then saw Brutto walk up to Carl and Rico and said \"Rico and Jenkins it's your lucky day, you two greenery's get to hall this baby upstairs.\" pointing at the ape marauder suit Gossard and Doc started to chuckle as they walked away Everyone got out their lizard line guns from their side pockets and aimed at a ledge half way up and fired the drill ends which lucky hit just on the tips of the ledge they was aiming for as Nicky started to go up she saw Rico press some buttons on his gauntlet and a control panel popped up and raised itself to his waist high due to him and Carl standing on the shoulders of the ape marauder suit it then fired two hooks into the rock to help them get up the cliff, as they headed up the cliff Nicky saw Gossard in front of her then she saw Dizzy pass her and stop near Gossard and say \"What's up Gossard your getting to slow.\" Gossard chuckled and replied \"Ha ha that's what every rookie say's.\" Nicky chuckled at that then she heard loud thuds and scraping noise's from just behind her, she turned and saw it was the marauder suit catching the odd sticking out of the cliff she then heard Brutto how was just below her yell \"Rico watch it that suit cost's more then you and your freaky pal put together stay forecast or the damage is coming out of your pay.\" As Rico and Carl pasted her she heard him say to Carl \"Nothing for nothing leaves nothing.\" Nicky tried not to laugh but Brutto then said as they passed \"What was that?\" to which Rico quickly said \"Nothing.\" Making her burst out laughing. A few minutes later Higgins, Dizzy, Doc, Gossard, and Nicky soon got to the ledge and climbed up and they was just waiting on Rico, Carl and the marauder to get up as well as Razak and Brutto how where just in front of them, while they waited they kept an eye on the area to make sure they are not attacked by any patrolling warrior or worker bugs just then they all heard there radio's go off again *\"Fleet command this is Mc Henry outpost come in Fleet command this is an emergency.\"* Nicky then thought *It sucks we cannot call them back because it'll give away our position.* but then her radio went off and saw went \"oh no.\" *\"Mc Henry outpost ... Carman do you read!\"* Nicky shook her head and said \"Dam it Rico.\" then she heard *\"Get out of that room, bug behind you.\"* She then saw Razak, Brutto and Rico clime up but then Razak turned to Rico and angrily said \"I said to stay off the radio bug's have antennae if they picked up that transmission no one is coming out of that compound alive.\" As Nicky passed them to see how far Carl and the marauder where from the top, when they all heard a clank and then a hiss Nicky saw Higgins how was already looking down at Carl and then he stood up and said \"What is it?\" probably replying to something Carl had said only then to hear Doc yell out \"BUGS!\" everyone turned and saw baby tankers coming out of the mountain and down from up higher up from their position and everyone opened fire killing many of them right away As they continued to fire Nicky turned to her left only to see Higgins using his camera to record everything as she went to say something to him she heard Rico yell out \"Carl!\" from behind her but before she could go help she saw Gossard go down with a baby tanker on his leg biting it she turned to her right and pulled out her dagger from its shoulder holder and then throw it hitting the bug on Gossard's leg in the head killing it, then she saw Dizzy shoot a baby tanker in the head with her lizard line gun killing it as the screw of the gun drilled into it making Dizzy say \"Ewww that's gotta hurt.\" Just as the last few bugs where killed Nicky then heard an explosion coming from the cliff edge and then thought *I think that was the marauder.* she then turned and ran to the edge only to see Carl and Rico clime up she stood there and said \"Hey you two need any help?\" before they could answer an angry Brutto stomped over to them and yelled \"You two was charged with getting that marauder here to clear the bugs!\" Rico then said \"I thought it was ...\" but Brutto interrupted him saying \"You don't think private you follow orders!\" only for Razak how had been walking up to them while that was going on and said \"Wrong sergeant.\" Brutto turned in shock as Razak then continued \"Private Rico made a tactical assessment ... this time it was the right one.\" Brutto was a bit angry but dropped it as he and Razak walked away leaving a confused Rico behind to which Nicky then said \"Radioing the outpost while it was for a good thing to warn them on the bug inside the base you giveaway our position leading to us being attacked, but shooting the wire to the marauder just below Carl there by getting rid of it saving Carl's life was the right thing.\" Rico nodded to what Nicky had said Nicky then walked to where Gossard was sat while Doc treated his leg with a sealing gel she then heard Doc say \"reconvicted surgery is the only option.\" Gossard then said in worry \"Leg's that bad?\" only for Doc to chuckle and say \"No I was talking about your face.\" Making Nicky laugh while Gossard did not look impressed After a few minutes they continued up the mountain and once they reached the top they saw a lip of the cliff edge and when they looked over it they saw a few feet of flat ground then it dropped into the mountain they slowly keeping low to the ground went to the edge that dropped into the mountain they saw three plasma bugs and a group two groups of five warriors patrolling them, Razak turned to Gossard and said \"Gossard tactical assessment?\" Gossard then said \"Small toad charge planted under one of them I'm good to go sir\" but Razak said while shaking his head \"Not with that leg.\" Pointing to his leg that had the sealant on then Rico said \"I'll do it I'm the fastest guy you've got\" Razak then turned to Dizzy and said \"Flories prep our evac plan, Gossard prep the charge while I and Revell cover Rico from here\" and everyone said \"SIR YES SIR\" Dizzy got everyone's lizard lines prepped within a few minutes while Gossard had prepped the toad charge and handed it to Rico how after getting the go ahead he ran down the edge of the mountain into it while the other roughnecks headed to the other edge and headed to the other edge to head back the way they had come while they did that Rico got half way there and then stopped at a small ledge a few feet from the plasma bugs and then throw the now activated toad charge and it soon landed under the middle plasma bug but then he heard a scream and saw one of the two patrolling bug packs charge towards him he stood and opened fire killing three of the five charging towards him before he turned and ran back the way he came from As he did so what he didn't see was a worker bug drop down from another ledge until it knocked him off his feet before it could do anything else it was gunned down by Razak and Nicky, Rico quickly got up and ran up and over the ledge joining Razak and Nicky only to kill the last two from the first group only for the other group to spot them and then charge towards them but Razak, Rico and Nicky ran to where Dizzy had left there lizard line guns where left, when they reached the guns they heard the toad charge go off and they saw the wall of fire coming out of the hole of the mountain and then along the flat top heading towards them Nicky then said \"Time to go!\" and they picked up their guns and then ran and jumped of the top and held on tight of their lizard line guns till the wire became tight stopping there fall around the same level as where the other roughnecks where hanging, Nicky looked up then to her left and saw Dizzy next to her and said \"Well we cooked them ... think fleet will use our bonfire as a marker?\" to her right she heard Razak say over the radio *\"Blue leader air space is clear send in retrieval\"* The roughnecks soon went back down to the ledge where they fought the baby tankers then pressed a button to unhook the drill from where it had drilled in and retrieved it and then did it again to get to the bottom of the mountain once they did Nicky saw the destroyed carcass of the ape marauder suit then she looked ahead and saw a retrieval ship come in and hover over the top of the outpost as the civilians and the two pilots as warriors started to climb up the walls and pushing themselves through doorways to the roof but everyone quickly got onboard the ship but there was thousands and thousands all around the Mc Henry outpost Nicky saw this throw her visor she raised it back up then turned to Razak and said \"Well LT at least we saved them sir but seeing all them bugs makes me think we're not even making a dent into their forces.\" Razak calmly replied \"Don't worry private it may not look it right here but we are.\" Nicky nodded and she turned as she saw the other roughnecks watching the rescued ship head back into space as another ship came in to pick them up Razak then yelled \"what do you think this is troopers R&R; move out!\" As they headed to the retrieval ship Razak then saw another MI trooper onboard as the roughnecks got to the ship the MI trooper walked up to them and said \"Lieutenant Razak you along with the roughnecks are to join three other regiments at sector five quad thirty to help push the bugs out of that sector and the neighing quads.\" Razak nodded and then turned to the roughnecks and said \"You heard the Captain collect any ammo needed while on here and prepare to get back into it.\" To which everyone yelled out \"SIR YES SIR.\"[Chapter 3] DAY 7 OF OPERATION ON PLUTO Bold font and *\"\"* – radio talk, Italic font and ** – thoughts, underline font and \"\" – TV or news reports, \"\" – normal speck, '' – whispering, and I own nothing in this story it's just an idea I had years ago Nicky was looking ahead watching as Fleet fighter's where bombing the forward positions of the infantry hitting the arachnid positions she looked slightly to her left and saw Nest Hunters, Cliff Jumper and Light Horse Platoon's with three tanks and two apc's holding position then in front of herself watching as the Bug Reaper and Buzzsaw platoon's with two tanks and one apc advancing to take the positions just bombed while to her right and saw the Roughnecks along with the Bug Stomper platoon holding the line Nicky then looked more to her right as she watched Higgins with his tripod holding his camera taping as he making a report for his fednet bosses on a hill just behind the Roughnecks on the past three day battle to bump up moral for new recruits and veterans, after joining the regiments at sector five quad thirty they have been able to advance and take ten full sectors from the bug forces and they were now pushing into sector ten quad one. Nicky then heard a roar and saw another Fleet squadron of three bombers fly over heard and bomb the right position she then heard over the radio Razak say *\"Roughnecks right flank assault now!\"* and Nicky saw the Roughnecks advancing while the Bug Stompers where holding their most right position Nicky then turned to Higgins and said \"come on paperboy we gotta keep up with the others the Saxons and Danes regiments are doing mop up\" Higgins nodded at her as he started to while she kept an eye out for trouble only then to heard Higgins yell out in shock making her turn and see him side stepping a warrior attacking Nicky turned and opened fire killing the bug only then to get clouted in the side of the head by something Higgins turned and saw Nicky being blindsided by another warrior and it also destroyed his rifle as he watched Nicky roll down the hill they was on only to roll into a damaged apc that was on its side that was behind their forces, Higgins paled and said to himself \"I'm in trouble\" only just to hear another screech and turned behind him and saw a third warrior and then said \"Defiantly in trouble\" he then jumped down the hill and slid to the apc to Nicky's side and avoiding the bugs making them charge and hitting each other stunning themselves giving Higgins the time to get Nicky slightly up and into the troop compartment before the warriors where able to get them Just after he had dragged Nicky and himself to the very back of it only to dough a claw coming in from the side that was the roof and then the other tried to force itself into the apc Higgins how was holding his tripod and camera and tried to hit the warrior with it while saying as he did it \"Don't make me use this.\" Only to hear a groan next to him as Nicky started to come round \"Oh my head what the hell hit me ow.\" she said as she went to get up only to stumble, Higgins knelt next to her and said \"You ok Nicky.\" to which Nicky replied \"Yar I'm fine do you have your morita with you.\" Only to hear Higgins reply \"no the bug that blindsided you destroyed it.\" Nicky then started to look around looking for her weapon only for Higgins to say \"Yours is just outside I didn't have the time to ...\" Nicky just calmly said \"it's ok paperboy\" she then patted herself down only to see just at the opening of the troop compartment to see her pistol laying there and then she asked Higgins \"Do you have your pistol on you?\" only to watch him shake his head she nodded at that then said \"I'll radio LT of our trouble, LT I and Higgins are trapped in a downed apc we need back up just behind where you was last sir.\" But when she didn't get a reply she then turned to Higgins and asked \"Can you check my radio I don't know if it went throw.\" Higgins nodded and checked her helmet and noticed the dent in it and that there was a cut going along the radio meaning it was destroyed and then he said \"Your radio is damaged I'll do it\" he then put his hand to his radio and said *\"Lieutenant Razak!\"* Few minutes later Nicky was trying to get close to the apc troop bay entrance to get her hand gun but the warrior's kept on taking swipes at her every time she tried while Higgins kept waiting on a radio reply from the rest of the squad but was worried about not getting a reply back but soon they heard bullets bouncing off the side of the apc and soon a death scream of one of the bugs but then hear a yell \"Gossard!\" which Nicky knew sounded like Rico then another small stint of gun fire and then more bug screams only to be followed in explosions, both Higgins and Nicky neared the opening they saw all of the Roughnecks arriving and Gossard laying on the floor in the jaws of a dead warrior bug but he was still moving so Nicky knew he was okish but hurt and then just as she and Higgins where about to leave the apc Nicky picked up her handgun and replaced it in its holder on her hip Nicky then took her arm from around Higgins shoulder then rested against the apc only just to slide down it as her head started to spin she saw feet walking towards her making her look up to see Razak as he looked down at her as he then knelt next to her to check her and to get a report \"So private what happened?\" Nicky looked at him and then said \"We where taping the mission then just as you advanced we started to pack up I kept an eye out for trouble while Higgins got his camera and stuff sorted out only to yell out as a warrior got the jump on him I don't know where it had come for I turned and opened fire killing it but then something blindsided me and then I don't remember much after that only Higgins waking me up a few minutes ago and I couldn't help us myself because I lost my rifle and my handgun landed near the opening and the bugs kept me away from getting it.\" Razak then asked \"And Higgins rifle?\" Nicky turned her head slightly and pointed to her left making Razak turn to see a morita rifle cut in two \"He said the warrior that blindsided me cut it in two.\" Razak saw Nicky start to lower her head making him turn and say \"Jenkins help Revell up Rico help Gossard we are returning to base.\" \"Sir yes sir.\" Everyone replied and the last thing Nicky heard was Higgins trying to say sorry for the trouble but everyone said it was ok Back at base an unknown about of time later Nicky started to come to groaning as she did and raising her robotic hand to her head the cool metal eased the headache she could feel she had, she turned to look around and saw to her left was Doc at a control panel and Gossard laying on a bed as his head was being scanned by a machine in the room only to watch as the machine finish and Gossard sat up, looking to her right she saw a window and another room where she could see all of the other Roughnecks with the exception of Razak looking in she then heard Brutto say \"Gossard's thick skull actually came in handy for once.\" Nicky started to chuckle along with the other Roughnecks but then she said in pain \"Come on guys don't make me laugh it hurts.\" Nicky went to sit up only then to hear Doc say \"Easy there Nicky you got a slight concussion from the blow you took.\" Nicky just replied \"I'm fine Doc it's just a headache and this is probably my one hundredth concussion I'll be fine if it gets worst I'll head back to medic bay.\" Doc shook his head as she then left the room and joins the other Roughnecks just as Razak entered the room he then turned to Doc and asked \"How are they Doc?\" \"They're both fine they just have to take it easy for a few days to recover\" making him nod Razak then said \"Higgins.\" Higgins turned to Razak and then Razak continued \"Son it's nothing personnel but your inability to protect yourself is compromising the safety of my squad I'm asking command to have you shipped earth side.\" Higgins looked shocked as did Nicky but she knew Razak was only looking out for the safety of the squad but still it was dishearten to hear Higgins being told that because he was fun to talk to and have a laugh with Higgins then said \"LT come on give me a chance ... I studied to be a reporter not a fighter but I'm willing to learn.\" Razak shook his head and said \"I'm sorry.\" He turned to leave but just before Nicky could say anything Rico then said \"It don't seem your being fair LT.\" Dizzy quickly said \"Rico.\" But he continued \"Higgins didn't want to be a trooper but he's willing to learn that got to count for something.\" Razak looked at Rico then said \"Ok you want him you got him.\" Rico looked perplexed at Razak and said \"Sir?\" Razak then said \"As of this moment Higgins is your primary response ability fail is not an option ... do you get me.\" Rico nodded as he said \"I get you sir.\" And then Razak left just after he had left Higgins went to Rico and said \"Thanks man.\" And Rico replied \"No problem.\" Higgins then said \"I won't let you down.\" Rico smirked and said \"It'll be a piece of cake.\" And then the both of them left Nicky shook her head and turned to Dizzy and said \"I think Rico's going to need a lot of help to get Higgins combat able.\" Dizzy nodded and chuckled as she said \"I better go keep an eye on him.\" Nicky turned to Doc and said \"well I'm off to the bunk area to get some sleep come get me if something happens ok.\" To which Doc nodded and Nicky left to go get some sleep. The next day Nicky woke up in the bunk area that was assigned for the Roughnecks and saw that she was the last one up the others must of left and the Roughnecks must of had some R&R; or the others would of woke her up she turned to her left and lent over the side of her bunk and picked up her robotic arm and reattached it to her shoulder then she looked at her legs and then remembered to leaving it on instead of normally taking it off like she normally did she then got up and got her change of close and headed to the shower area and went to get clean before heading to the VR training room An hour later Nicky was entering the VR training room after getting washed and changed into her new clothes she checked the rankings for the Roughnecks she looked at the ranks and was a bit unhappy but didn't really mind it went Gossard, Dizzy then herself, followed by Brutto, Doc, Rico, Carl and then last was Higgins. Nicky knew that Razak and all other squad leaders didn't take part in the VR training room squad competitions as she prepped the system to be used so she could try and beat Gossard's and Dizzy's latest scoring but just as she was about to get started the door opened behind her and someone said \"Well I'll be a monkeys auntie hey sis.\" Nicky turned to have a look how it was and saw it was her sister Zoe that was behind her Nicky smiled at seeing her sister and said \"What are you doing here thought you was still onboard the Valley Forge with the others.\" As she walked up to her sister and gave her a hug which Zoe returned and then said \"Me, Erika and Hannah have been put into a squad in Bravo company in the Razorback squad and I know Yasmin is still onboard the Valley Forge transporting troops and gear between the ship and this base, I think Raven is posted somewhere here but I don't know for sure.\" Nicky chuckled at that and said jokingly \"So our reporter sister is not so miss know it all.\" Zoe put her hands on her hips and smirked as she replied saying \"Shut up sis I hate it when you remind me about me always reporting stuff to people.\" Nicky shook her head and replied \"anyway what did you want an interview with your more experienced sister or do you just want to hang out ocean eyes.\" Zoe pouted as she said \"I hate that nickname robo eyes.\" Nicky chuckled at that then Zoe said \"I wondered if you fancied eating lunch with your sister\" Nicky nodded \"Sure sis last time we eat together was a few days I woke up in hospital after you and Erika had found our battle site.\" Nicky followed Zoe out of the VR room and headed to the cafeteria; while they walked Nicky asked Zoe \"So how has carrot eyes and mismatch eyes been?\" to which she replied \"They're been ok just shocked that we was placed on the same squad although by the bandage on your head you have been in heavy combat with the bug's.\" Nicky then said \"I'll tell you what happened after we get with the others that way I'm not repeating it over and over again.\" Zoe nodded at her sister as they entered the cafeteria she saw some troopers she's never met before sat on some tables and eating and talking to other squad mates she then saw at one table Rico, Carl and Higgins sat at a table eating and talking while at another one sat Hannah and Erika she turned to Zoe and said \"You get our food while I check in with my squad and then I'll join you.\" she nodded and went to collect some food while Nicky walked up to Rico and the others and said \"Hey guy's I take it we have some R&R;?\" Rico nodded and said \"Not sure yet but we have not been given any missions yet today so you joining us?\" to which Nicky replied \"I'm just catching up with my sisters.\" Rico nodded at her as Nicky then walked up to where her sisters where sat and joined them and then they started to talk about how cool it was that Hannah and Erika where posted to the same unit again and that Zoe was joining them as there fednet reporter and the fact that the Razerbacks had only been doing garrison and evacing missions although since the start of the big planet wide offensive they had been given some combat missions and a few sweep up missions Finally Zoe couldn't take it and said \"so sis what's with the bandage around your head?\" Nicky subconsciously rubbed it and replied \"nothing much sis just got blindsided by a warrior bug while protecting our reporter, bug thought to see which was harder it's jaw or my helmet... to be honest I think it was a draw it stunned me and I was in a daze after that don't remember much.\" Erika chuckled at that and said \"you have always had a hard head sis that's nothing knew so that's what your hundredth concussion?\" Zoe chuckled along with Hannah and went to say something when they all heard and argument behind them turning they saw it was coming from the table Nicky had gone to before sitting down with them they saw it was between a girl and the guy Nicky had spoke to Zoe turned back around and said \"hey sis how's that girl arguing with the guy you spoke to?\" Nicky shook her head as she replied \"the girl's name is Dizzy and the guy is Rico them two and two others joined from them same collage and they are close friends, the only problem is that Dizzy has romantic interests in Rico but the pea brain has the hot's for a fleet officer that joined and don't see it.\" Just then the screen on the table they was on came to life and after a few minutes it went off again making them all stand and leave there food, Nicky saw this and said \"Carl what's up?\" Carl quickly said \"Mission.\" making Nicky nod she then turned to her sister's and say \"So much for being able to stay and with you guys but gotta go.\" Zoe quickly said as Nicky got up to leave \"Well just make sure you're staying out of trouble sis and come back in one piece ok.\" Nicky nodded then quickly followed the others to get there gear and head out. Two and a half hours later The Roughnecks had been marching north of base Delta towards a canyon ten miles from the base to help a demo squad that was in battle in the area but they all could tell where it was happening due to flashes of red and white lights a few minutes ahead of them Nicky saw Rico and stood and talking to Gossard about why he didn't come get his own food earlier if he was able to be on this mission to which he replied with a smile that he maybe liked room service just then she saw Razak raise his hand to his radio and called the squad they was coming to help *\"Vector squad this is alpha team we are a few minutes away from your position what's your ammo and casualty count?\"* to which he got an instant reply *\"This is corporal Spike Lee it's good to hear you alpha team my LT is injured along with two others but there wounds are non-fatal but our ammo is running low the only thing stopping us from being overrun is a auto mini gun we have that's ripping them up at the mouth of our bottle neck but it's nearing the twenty percent mark of left over ammo.\"* and from the sounds they could hear through the radio the troopers were also firing into the bugs as well Razak then replied *\"Will drop lizard lines after bombardment to hold the bugs back over and out.\"* Just as they arrived at the top of the cliff that Vector squad was in they could see the trouble the squad was in but also how many they had killed along with more that they could see that were coming Razak turned to the roughnecks and said \"Dizzy, Carl, Doc and Gossard scatter bomb's to hold them back while Rico, Higgins, Brutto and Nicky use lizard lines to get down there and cover Vector while they head up.\" Everyone nodded and said \"Sir Yes Sir.\" As Dizzy's group started to fire there scatter bomb grenades high and deep into the bug forces to not only slow them down but kill a few making them slow down more and hopefully hold them back while the others got Vector squad out of there position or drive the bugs off while that was happening the other roughnecks kept an eye out for any other signs of trouble as Nicky glanced south back the way the roughnecks had come she caught sight of something that shocked her In the air heading towards them where flying bug forces that she remembered fighting before the first time she instantly turned and said \"LT! Bug hoppers incoming!\" All the rough necks turned and opened fire at the new arrivals but the others except Razak and Nicky where shocked as most of the bullets just seemed to bounce off the flying bugs with only a grenade's killing them in one shot, they soon had to move and split up as a few headed for them Nicky saw one chasing Dizzy as she tried to use a stone pillar to keep between herself and the bug only for it to get a grenade to its head killing it by Gossard and then Rico arrived a second or two after. Razak grunted as he then put his hand to his radio and called the Valley Forge *\"Blue Leader this is alpha team we are in need of immediate air support at our location to suppress enemy air forces.\"* after a few minutes a squadron of ten thunderbolt tac fighters came in to help but that only helped for a while but Nicky could hardly tell as she looked around she saw another larger swarm coming up from the south-east she turned and said \"LT!\" Making Razak turn to her after killing another hopper bug from hitting it with a grenade she pointed the direction she had been looking and after seeing what was coming he got on the radio and said *\"Vector heads up airborne forces heading to you.\"* Soon after that gun fire and laser shots where coming out of the bowl Vector where positioned, Razak then turned and said \"Brutto check ammo reserves.\" Brutto nodded and began to check with the others while Nicky knelt next to Higgins and asked while firing at a few of the hopper bugs \"So Higgins how's the training coming?\" He faltered as he went to fire but then said \"Not very well for every bug kill I did on the training I killed an ally.\" Nicky shock her head and said \"At least you've not done it here and I know you won't.\" she then saw Brutto yell to Razak from his place not too far from them \"Ten laser mags, twenty plasma rockets and ten anti-matter grenades.\" only for a hopper to go for him only to be blown to bits by Doc and the fedcom 'triple grenade launcher' he had. He then said while raising the launcher \"We keep dishing it out and these over grown roaches keep coming back for more.\" Rico then added \"The rifles hardly affect them and the laser shots just draw more in sir.\" Razak paused for a moment then said while looking at everyone \"Ideas anyone?\" as he wished to test them on working under pressure while in combat, a few moments went by while everyone thought and continued to fire at the odd hopper that tried to attack them Nicky then said \"Lt maybe we could draw them all into a area and then take them all out in one go?\" Razak nodded to her as he had thought of one that may work turning he said \"Dizzy load your morita with the laser mags Gossard make a toad charge to take all the bugs out in one blast.\" Brutto then asked \"How are we going to make the bugs converge into the area we want them to Lt?\" Higgins then said nervously \"We could amplify the beam into the air to help draw them in.\" Brutto turned to him and said \"How?\" Higgins then reached behind himself and took his camera of his back then took the lens off it and held it out to Razak how smiled slightly and then said \"Move it squad.\" to which everyone said \"HO!\" It took the Roughnecks less than five minutes to get everything ready while taking the odd pot shot at a hopper that got to close while everyone got hidden Razak turned to Gossard and Dizzy how where next to him and asked \"We ready?\" to which they nodded he then said over the radio \"Blue leader call back fighter's from the sector and have them return to base or help other squads we have this covered.\" within moments the air force left he then turned to Doc and said quickly \"As soon as we get started you taken Rico, Jenkins and Revell go help Vector.\" as he nodded they all headed a rumble and then a explosion Nicky turned and ran to the edge for the cliff and saw a new bug hole being opened and out climbed a tanker but the worst thing was where it had come up from it had taken out the minigun auto turret that was holding back the bugs from swarming Vector she turned back around and yelled \"LT! A tanker's just taken out the auto turret we have to go now!\" Razak instantly said \"Dizzy, Doc now.\" and with a nod Dizzy flicked down her visor and then with its help fired the laser beam from her rifle into the lens from Higgins camera which then hit another mirror making it go straight up into the sky and as that was going on Doc's group using all of the lizard lines they had shot them into the edge of the cliff and then abseiled down to help Vector squad they was about half way down when a massive explosion rocked them from the top of the cliff soon followed by Doc firing his grenade launcher again decapitating the tanker and then saying just as Nicky passed him \"Great back to fighting bugs that crawl.\" Nicky chuckled as she landed and ran to a makeshift barricade and opened fire upon the warriors and worker bugs after a few minutes someone fired a plasma wall barrier holding any more attacks by the warriors. Doc turned to Nicky and said \"Head back up top and tell LT were clear.\" nodding she turned and using one of the lizard lines headed back to the top just after she got to the top a few feet away she saw Razak stood about to call in the area was clear and for a pick up when a badly injured hopper stood up behind him and roared he turned in shock getting knocked backwards but just as it was about to attack him a missile hit the hopper in the chest killing it just as the dust and bits settled both Nicky and Razak were shocked at how had taken the shot as the person lowered the rocket launcher it turned out to be Higgins but what he said next made Nicky laugh he smiled and said happily \"That was so cool! I think I'm beginning to get this soldier stuff.\" Two hours later Two retrieval ships had landed one to carry the troopers back to base or the Valley Forge while the other was loaded with all the equipment and a few dead hoppers to compare them to the original ones from operation pest control Nicky was sat on a rock cleaning her rifle with Higgins sat next to her when Razak walked up to them and said to Higgins \"Well done son.\" Nicky smiled for Higgins as he had now turned into a soldier/reporter like her sister but she knew he still had a way to go but it's a start Razak then held up the nearly destroyed lens for Higgins camera and said \"we'll need to recursion you a new one when we get back.\" Higgins excepted the lens back and placed it in he's pocket as Razak walked away and began to talk to the injured Vector commander Higgins had gone to thank Rico for his help leaving Nicky on her own while she finished cleaning her rifle as much as she could while they was waiting for the last few things to be stored on the ship. Nicky looked north back towards where the battle had taken place when she noticed a large mist she quickly flicked her visor down and have it zoom in to the mist only to be shocked when she saw it was billions and billions of hopper flyers she quickly said while pointing \"LT! We got trouble!\" she turned to face Razak just as he flicked down his visor and then he yelled \"All personal board the ships pilots prep for dust off.\" Everyone quickly ran to the retrieval ships and boarded only to then have them take off and clime only for Nicky to look on the screen that showed one of the camera's around the ship the billions of hoppers taking the area they had just fought and won for as she then thought *well this has just made taking Pluto back quickly with minimal casualties less likely now I hope my sisters are careful.*[Chapter 4] DAY 9 OF OPERATION ON PLUTO Bold font and *\"\"* – radio talk, Italic font and ** – thoughts, underline font and \"\" – TV or news reports, \"\" – normal speck, '' – whispering, and I own nothing in this story it's just an idea I had years ago The momentum of victory's and clearing sectors for the mobile infantry slowed to a crawl due to the hopper flyers all of yesterday SICON had been making sure all the sectors they had already taken where secure before they decided to advance and gain more sectors. Today the Roughnecks where in sector ninety-eight quad six along with Charlie and Tango squads while ten other platoons where clearing other quads to the west of them. Nicky, Rico and Dizzy used a small dip in the ground like a trench they was soon joined by the other Roughnecks just after they entered the trench the ground started to shake the ground then gave way under Nicky, Rico and Dizzy they all hit the floor as they quickly got up Nicky saw Doc and Gossard kill a warrior bug before it could get any ideas about attacking them, Rico then looked ahead of them to the left with Dizzy looking right only to hear a warrior scream coming from Rico making Nicky turn and help Rico open fire and kill the bug. Razak and the other Roughnecks soon dropped down and joined them soon more bugs tried to attack but was quickly killed as the last one fell over dead Dizzy make a buzzer noise and said \"The buzzer go's humans fifty-eight bugs zero!\" then she high-fived Brutto they then soon left the cave they had dropped into and saw Tango and Charlie squads pass them to continue the mission only for the radio to go off and Razak and everyone to hear * \"Alpha team this is Blue Leader come in.\"* Razak held up his hand stopping the squad and replied *\"Go ahead Blue Leader this is Razak Alpha team.\"* They then heard the operator on the other end say *\"Alpha team you have been ordered back to base for resupply and reassignment.\"* upon hearing this the others were shocked as that was not a normal thing to do while a squad was already on a mission Nicky knew of only a few reasons why this would happen and none of them was for anything good Rico was the first to speak what was on everyone's mind \"What? Were breaking contact.\" Only for Dizzy to say \"Orr man they can't do that this party was just getting good.\" Brutto then said to Razak \"Sir Charlie and Tango can't do anything without back up.\" But Higgins replied \"Yar but orders are orders right LT.\" for his comment Brutto gave him an angry look with Dizzy and Rico not looking happy about it only for Razak to say \"If Blue Leader told us to brake contact, We brake contact so we move out.\" he then got on his radio and replied *\"Understood Blue Leader will head to last ammo supply post and take a troop transport back to base Delta.\"* He got an instant reply from the operator saying *\"Understood over and out.\"* As the squad headed back to the supply post to be taken back to base Nicky then said to Carl how was next to her \"Whatever this mission is that we have been given can't be good.\" Gossard how was just in front of them replied \"What do you mean?\" Nicky looked at him and said \"either we're needed to help another squad somewhere, we have done something wrong and were going to be arrested when we arrive back and the worst one I can think of is Intel or Special ops need a squad for a mission behind enemy lines or to capture a bug for them.\" Carl then asked \"Which would you want it to be?\" Nicky looked at him and said \"None of them and we're just being called back to guard the base or a new one they are trying to build as we have not done anything that would see any of us being arrested, there is probably over forces in the area that could help however is in trouble closer than us and I have a problem with the last one as I hate them and for good reason.\" She raised her robotic arm after she finished speaking as to make a point about her hate of the last option Two and a half hours later After getting back to the supply drop and hopping aboard a Gecko armoured personnel carrier they arrived back at Delta base and they was just disembarking when Nicky said as she exited first \"I hope this is for some R&R; or nothing to boring.\" Gossard chuckled and replied \"Well if that resupply and reassignment is code for that it maybe something I could get behind.\" Doc nodded in agreement only for Dizzy to pout and say \"And miss out on kicking more bugs behinds I hope not they could of just waited till we were done.\" Rico and Carl chuckled at that The squad then began to head to the main building to see the commander to find out what was going on when a lieutenant in a clean power suit walked up to them and asked \"Are you the Roughnecks?\" the squad stopped and Razak stepped forward and said \"I'm lieutenant Razak of the Roughnecks.\" Nicky looked at the person how had walked you to them and her danger sense was starting to go off and she thought to herself *Dam it, it's an Intel mission.* The Lieutenant nodded and said \"Good follow me to operation room so I can brief you on our mission.\" As the squad followed the Intel officer to the main operation building to head to a briefing room Nicky was not happy about what the mission is going to be but she was also a bit worried about her sisters Hannah, Erika and Zoe as they were also out on mission's today but she didn't know where but she knew they would be fine and just focused on what hers and the Roughnecks mission might be After entering the building and then finding the main room free they entered the room that had a console and projector they formed a circle around it and waited as the Intel officer entered a code into the console which soon brought up a map of Pluto which had white dots on it to representing base's, blue lines to show the boarders of where the mobile infantry have taken from the bugs and red lines to show where the bugs still held and yellow areas that would flick between red and blue on the planet and then highlighted an area in a red area quite a long way from any of the blue zones Once it was all up and ready the Intel officer turn and faced the Roughnecks and spoke \"gather round I'm Lieutenant Earl Walker Intel our mission is to go behind enemy lines and to capture a baby plasma bug so we can better understand there destructive ability's.\" Nicky's gut feeling went more down the drain but she then heard Higgins whisper to Rico 'What do's he mean by we.' Rico replied 'When it's an Intel mission.' to which Carl finished 'They take command.' And Nicky added 'There missions mean we troopers are expendable all they care about is there mission objective.' The briefing was soon finished as Walker also added that a old base deep behind enemy lines would have a Mac hauler and troop transport which was to be used for the mission and they should be in full working order but they was going to have to travel light and on foot to try and get the element of surprise but even Nicky knew it wouldn't be that simple Five and a half hours later Nicky and the other Roughnecks along with LT Walker arrived at the old base after getting a troop transport as close to the front lines as they could and then hiking the rest of the way avoiding any combat as much as the Roughnecks didn't wish to they entered through the main gate to see three damaged buildings and a large damaged garage with the two transports in it and a perimeter wall that was also damaged and destroyed in areas the Roughnecks guessed it was going to look like this but from the look Nicky could see on Walkers face he was not happy he then said \"Troopers spread out and get me inventory and working states now.\" Razak turned and nodded to them and they split up with Gossard and Doc heading to the garage while Brutto, Dizzy, Carl, Rico and Nicky headed to check the buildings for anything that was of any use and Higgins stayed with Razak and Walker After an hour Brutto was called to help with repairing the transports and the others continued to search the buildings and they finished with the last building only finding a few ammo crates along with the tranquiliser rifles that they was going to be using they collected the ammo crates and rifles and headed back to the garage they placed the gear on the troop carrier just as Nicky was leaving the troop hold she saw Walker walk up to Razak how was overseeing the repairs and say \"Lieutenant Razak we are five minutes behind schedule.\" To which Razak replied \"Both transports needed extensive repairs departure in five.\" To which Walker nodded and said \"Very well Lieutenant are we clear?\" which Razak replied \"Crystal sir.\" Nicky was curious and turned to Brutto who was walking toward her \"What happened?\" to which Brutto just chuckled and continued to head to Razak to make a report they was soon leaving and heading toward the location where they was meant to make the grab After they arrived and leaving the transports hidden and safe they walked to an out cropping and using his visor Razak made a tactical assessment along with Walker they then headed Walker say \"There's one incubation cave still being guarded by six warriors we need a destruction team and a capture team.\" Razak turned to the squad and said \"Doc and Gossard left side you two go first then Dizzy and Nicky right side and lure the bugs while we do this Brutto, you and Rico with Walker head in and capture our target we shall enter and assist once guards are down.\" They quickly and quietly got into their groups and got ready Nicky and Dizzy waited for both Doc and Gossard moved Dizzy turned to Nicky and said \"Can we have a talk about something when we return to base after this mission?\" Nicky turned to her and asked \"Sure Dizzy is it serious?\" Dizzy shook her head and said \"No just about our past and stuff so we can get to know each other more I'm going to get Rico and Carl in on this too\" Nicky nodded and went to speck when they both heard Doc yell \"HEY MUTANT BREATH!\" and Gossard continue it with a yell \"COME AND GET IT!\" Both Nicky and Dizzy turn and saw half of the warriors ran to get them they waited a few more seconds before Nicky said \"Ok now.\" And they both jumped out of there hiding places and Dizzy yelled \"WO HO, WHERES EVERYBODYS GOING!\" then she did a sexy stance with both her hands on her hips pushing out her chest and continued \"THE PARTY'S OVER HERE!\" and Nicky made a come get me motion with her hands and yelled \"HEY ARE YOU AFRID OF A PAIR OF UNARMED GIRLS YOU PUSSYS!\" The left over warriors roared at them and charged them making them both turn and run to the kill zone that was made near the out cropping they used as a look out they had just got there and saw the other bugs where already dead and Doc and Gossard throw them both their rifles they turned and formed up with Razak, Higgins, Carl, Doc and Gossard and just as the bugs all turned the corner they opened fire instantly killing them Razak once making sure the bugs where dead turned and said \"Let's help Walker.\" As they started to head to the entrance that Brutto and co had entered Nicky saw another pathway and pointed to it saying \"LT second tunnel may be another way to the nest.\" They soon entered the second pathway after a few minutes they came to a ledge and Nicky accidently kicked a small group of stones over the edge and as they looked over it they saw Brutto, Rico and Walker aiming up at them and a empty egg that was hanging from the roof not that far from them it was then before anyone could speck the ground started to shake and then it began to crack behind Rico to which Dizzy yelled \"LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU!\" The capture group turned as the ground was pushed up behind them and out emerged a small plasma bug and it roar at them and very slowly charged them making the capture team turn and run to the wall just below the ledge and quickly they climbed up the wall as the baby head butted the wall it dazed itself giving the capture team time to get to the ledge and join the others After it came too it looked around for a second then it jumped onto a small ledge big enough for it but still too far from the Roughnecks it looked at them then turned around and aimed its rear at the Roughnecks Brutto seeing this yelled out \"INBOUND!\" everyone turned and raised up their main rifles and Razak said \"Prepare to fire.\" Walker saw this and turned to Razak and said \"Don't you dare kill that bug Lieutenant you don't have the authority to kill it.\" Everyone got ready to shoot to kill when Walker added to what he had said to Razak \"You give that order I'll make it my personal mission to end your military career.\" With a grunt Razak turned to Walker and said \"Defensive angle 45 digress.\" The Roughnecks nodded slightly and adjusted their aim and fired hitting the point where the ledge the bug was stood on joined the wall itself after the quick burst of fire the ledge gave way under the weight of the bug and collapsed making the bug fall and dazed it as it hit the ground Razak then turned to Doc and Gossard and said \"Doc, Gossard round of tranq's throw the back door now!\" both of them shouldered their rifles and aimed with the tranquiliser rifles and fired most bounced off what armour the bug had but four somehow got to the skin and hit the soft flesh and injected the drug into the system of the bug and within seconds it became dazed and then collapsed asleep The Roughnecks cheered as Walker turned to Razak and said quietly \"Well done Lieutenant.\" Razak didn't say anything to Walker as he walked away but then to the others he said \"Secure the prisoner.\" A few minutes later Nicky who was stood next to Higgins as he recorded Gossard and Rico pulling out the sleeping baby plasma with the help of the Mac Hauler crane drag the bug onto its flat bed, once it was on it the flat-bed lifted itself up and then locked back onto the hauler but as it did so it did it with a bang making Walker how was stood next to him yell \"WOW be careful sergeant.\" Brutto looked at him and said \"Sir?\" Walker then said while pointing at the baby plasma \"Do you feel like blowing us up as before this bug was put to sleep it was preparing to fire at us which has now got a very highly unstable reaction inside of it, so any sudden knock may make it go off so I want this handled with care and ready to leave in five minutes.\" And then he walked away Nicky's already low opinion of Intel was going even lower when Rico who was near Brutto said \"So which of the brilliant orders should we listen to first hurry up or handle with care?\" Nicky chuckled at that only for Gossard to come around the hauler and say \"He forgot to say which end it up.\" As he pointed to the rear of the baby plasma making Nicky laugh more Higgins how had stopped recording before Walker had spoken walked to Gossard and said \"So it's not going to wake up until its back on the Valley Forge?\" Gossard replied \"We hit it with four darts and Intel says an hour for each dart ... give or take.\" To which Higgins sighed in relief \"So yar.\" Nicky then said \"But we are talking Intel Higgins we had to fix these before we could even get started.\" While they was talking Dizzy how was finishing placing their gear back on the troop transport when she heard a loud thud noise from a long distance away she turned and flicked down her visor and saw two adult plasma bugs walking towards them she turned and yelled \"LT! COMPANYS COMING!\" Razak turned seeing the bugs he then turned to Doc and said \"Shadow Walker in the flat-bed and get our guest out of here.\" He nodded and quickly joined Walker in the cab of the hauler and they drove away while the other Roughnecks quickly got aboard the troop transport and also left as they drove to head to the pickup point at the destroyed base that they had started from to be retrieved by a fleet ship that would return them to base Delta avoiding plasma shots along the way As they headed back avoiding fire as it came Brutto looked out the back of the transport and said \"I don't get it all this for some stupid bug.\" To which they all heard over the radio Walker reply *\"This bug is wealth more than you do at the minute sergeant.\"* Razak then replied *\"The sergeant is just reacting to the stress of the mission.\"* And then Walker answered *\"This squad has a reputation for being cool under pressure are you telling me that is all but a myth.\"* Nicky then angrily answered *\"We are cool under pressure when we are fighting alongside other MI forces not miles behind enemy lines on some crappy time limit just because Intel want a new bug to dissect and find out how it works, they should ask us MI grunts and fleet pilot's that take part in missions you paper pushing coward.\"* To which Razak added *\"I think what the private means is the Roughnecks have taken you this far that alone should speck for itself.\"* He then opened the small hatch from the cab to the troop bay and looked at Nicky and said \"Do you feel better after that trooper?\" Nicky nodded slightly and said \"Sorry LT I just don't trust Intel after what there last mistake cost me.\" An hour later The transports arrived back at the base they had started from only to see a fleet skyhook retrieval ship just coming in to land, after it had landed it lowered its loading bay and stood on it was Zander Barcalow he offered his hand to Walker as he said \"Hello Lieutenants happy to see you made it back.\" Walker just walked past him onto the ramp to head aboard the ship while Razak smirked and then turned to the squad and said \"Ok Roughnecks let's get our prize aboard.\" It only took a few minutes to get the baby plasma aboard and then they took of heading back to base as they did so Brutto, Doc and Gossard was sat in the back keeping an eye on the bug while the others where stood behind the pilot's as Barcalow then began to speak to the lieutenants but the others could hear what was being said \"As of 0800 this morning the bugs have attacked many sectors and have pushed back MI forces back from five full sectors with a few being contested as we speak, MI have suffered many casualties but from latest info no fatalities.\" The Roughnecks felt down at the info with Nicky starting to really worry about her sisters and where they was at this point in time only for Walker to say arrogantly \"The information this bug can give us on their destructive capability is vital so this mission cannot be stressed enough.\" Nicky growled in anger and left into the cargo hold before she did or said something she might not regret. Razak saw this and so did Dizzy she turned to face the LT when he made a motion to follow Nicky, Dizzy quickly left and saw Nicky leaning against a wall away from Brutto and co and the baby plasma looking at the floor trying to keep her emotions in check Dizzy walked up to her and said \"You ok Nicky, I know the info we got from Barcalow is dishearten but we'll take them back.\" Nicky looked at her and said \"It's not that three of my sisters are in the same company and I know they are on Pluto doing missions today somewhere, I wasn't able to find out before we left for this mission where they was being posted too and Barcalow didn't say what sectors have been lost or contested for.\" Dizzy then said \"They could be back at base or winning us a sector too you know?\" Nicky's worries lessened a bit from that as she replied \"True Dizzy ... Thanks.\" Just then they heard a groan and then a screech and an ouch as Gossard was knocked away from the baby plasma Nicky signed as she said \"So much for Intel's hour per dart rule.\" The door opened to show Razak and Walker walking through to see what was going on only for Walker to say \"Prep tranquiliser rounds now.\" Brutto and Nicky got a shock stick each that was in the weapon rack and started to shock the baby plasma to keep it still while Doc and Gossard got the tranquiliser rifles ready only for Barcalow to speak over the ships speaker system *\"Lieutenants we are entering sector fifteen quad two that is at the minute being contested between the bugs and MI companies on foot and with apc transports that are carrying wounded from the ship TFCT San Francisco along with another company on foot from the Valley Forge\"* Razak then asked *\"Who is the company on foot forming protection.\"* Barcalow then said the name of the company on foot which made Nicky worry a lot *\"Its Bravo company from the Valley Forge one of the squads the Razorbacks is calling for immediate aid it's a corporal by the name of Hannah Revell.\"* Nicky paled as she then thought *oh no my sisters* Razak noticed this in the corner of his eye but his derisions didn't change from what he was going to do he saw Doc and Gossard getting ready to fire the tranqs at the baby plasma he then said \"Eighty-six the tranqs were going to drop this over size tick right on top of his pals.\" Walker turned to him and said \"You don't have the authority Lieutenant.\" Razak turned to Walker and said \"My mission right now is to help them troopers that are this moment fighting to stay alive.\" He then said into the com next to him to Barcalow *\"Major Barcalow how do you feel about making a bombing run.\"* And Barcalow replied *\"Absolutely. \"* As the ship turned to get over the bug army chasing Bravo company Gossard pressed the ramp release clamps button and as they neared the enemy Barcalow opened the hatch and then counted down till release *\"Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... bombs away.\"* and Barcalow released the plat that had the baby plasma on it, it fell away from the ship as they flew over the bug army and it landed right in the middle making the baby plasma explode causing a chain reaction with other plasma bugs kill them and all of the other bugs in the area saving Bravo company and eliminating the bug forces chasing them the radio then went off with Hannah saying *\"To whoever it is in the ship over head thanks for the assist.\"* Nicky walked to Barcalow and asked \"Can I reply?\" he nodded and she then said to her sister *\"Don't worry sis just returning the overdue dealt I owe you.\"* Nicky could hear laughter on the other end of the radio and then Hannah answered *\"Ha Ha a dealt I remember telling you didn't have to keep sis guess I'm happy you never listen talk to you again when were both back at base later.\"* Nicky then said *\"Later sis tell the others I said Hi and stay out of trouble.\"* as she put the radio down she felt a lot better and also heard Razak talk to Walker about him clamming credit for the bombing run once they returned to base she just walked to a seat in the back and just sat and relaxed as they returned to base.[Chapter 5] DAY 11 OF OPERATION ON PLUTO Bold font and *\"\"* – radio talk, Italic font and ** – thoughts, underline font and \"\" – TV or news reports, \"\" – normal speck, '' – whispering, and I own nothing in this story it's just an idea I had years ago Nicky laid on her bunk holding her head with her left hand thinking about the last two days after returning to the base Walker told high command that it was his idea dropping the baby plasma that saved the troops from the TFCT San Francisco and Valley Forge he received a medal for it with the Roughnecks only getting a small bit of gratitude however the troopers from both Bravo and Charlie knew who to thank Nicky looked down at her missing arm and then glanced at her just as missing leg sometimes wishing she had her flesh and bone parts back as she could never sleep with the prosthetics on and why she was in the Roughneck bunk room on her own and not with the rest of the squad. Yesterday they had been doing a sweep and clear mission only for her to be injured when a hopper was killed in the air and it decided to crash into her the power suit took most of the damage but she still also got a broken rib out of it she was ordered by Razak back to base to be treated while they carried on the mission, she was soon patched up and given the day off to heal along with today once the Roughnecks returned from the mission they got earlier that she missed she was allowed to rejoin the squad Just then the bunkroom door slid open and in walked a miffed Dizzy and Nicky could hear Rico say \"Come on Dizzy there was nothing we could of done, we did what we could and I'm sure you killed the most bugs out there today\" Dizzy just grunted and then slammed her helmet on to the ground Nicky then saw the rest of the Roughnecks enter with Higgins taping everything then he said \"For the third time in two days a simple skirmish proved over welling.\" Razak then entered and said \"Everyone sit down SICON has just got use a new mission so re-prep your gear we move out in ten including you Nicky.\" Rico then asked \"Sir could we have a little sleep first?\" Nicky turned to Carl and asked \"I guessed you have been in a few parties without me.\" Carl replied \"Only a little.\" Razak then said \"Sorry Rico but you're going to have to wait for your beauty sleep, everyone re-gear up and meet in the mission briefing room two in five.\" To which everyone replied \"Sir Yes sir.\" As everyone started to sort out their gear Nicky reached to the floor next to her bunk and picked up her arm and attached it to her shoulder after a it was on she was reaching for her leg when she heard \"Why do you take them off when you sleep?\" Nicky looked and saw it was Dizzy who had asked it with Rico, Carl and Higgins also looking curious about it, Nicky replied as she finished attaching her leg \"They are to cold and it annoys me when I'm sleeping so I've just always taken them off when I do.\" She then got her power suit on, her rifle and then joined the Roughnecks for the new mission Three hours later Nicky looked up the cliff she had just got down as the other Roughnecks where just getting to the ground SICON had decided to try and find bug city the main base of operations for the bugs and blowing it to hell the only problem was they didn't know where it was so the plan was to send out eleven squads to the eleven areas where the bugs where in the highest of numbers Once it was found the lucky squad had to call in the fleet and get out of the area before they was caught in the bombing run if it was on the surface or deep strike from a battleship bombardment if it was underground, the Roughnecks was given sector fifty quad ten Nicky also knew her sisters Hannah, Erika and Zoe where also taking part in this mission with there squad but in a different sector As the Roughnecks continued on foot walking to another mountain with Doc on point after getting down from the cliff and heading south Doc held up his hand stopping the squad Nicky how was closet quickly joined him and in a valley just to the left of the mountain they was heading too where eight warrior bugs patrolling a opening into the ground Doc then said to himself \"Looks like this is our nest?\" only then to see another eight worker bugs walking you to the warrior bugs and them leaving into the hole to which Doc said to himself \"Hold the phone looks like we're in time for a changing of the guard.\" Both then headed to Razak and the others to say what they had seen after telling Razak he then came up with a plan Nicky how was next to Gossard and Dizzy heard Gossard say to Dizzy \"Bet you he picks me.\" Only for them to hear Razak say \"Gossard.\" He winked at Dizzy making both her and Nicky chuckle Then Razak continued \"Distract them any that take the bait myself, Flores and Doc will deal with, Brutto take Rico and Jenkins take out the ones that stay Higgins.\" Nicky turned to face Higgins as he got a hopeful look on his face only for his rifle ammo magazine to drop from his rifle to the floor she saw this and heard Razak say \"Stay here with Nicky and take out any reinforcements that may turn up.\" Nicky replied \"No problem sir we'll keep an eye out.\" Carl putted Higgins on his shoulder as he went with Brutto and Rico, while Nicky picked up the ammo mag and replaced it into Higgins rifle and made sure it was in right as she then said \"Don't worry Higgins you're getting better just things happen.\" And she handed it back and then they all took their places Once in place Nicky watched as Gossard left there hiding spot and ran towards the bugs picking up a rock as he did so once he neared the bugs he stopped and throw the rock hitting a worker on the head then yelled \"COME AND GET IT!\" Half the bugs including the one hit by the rock charged after Gossard as he ran to the right of where he had come from to where Razak's group was waiting just after they had gone Brutto's group left there cover heading for the ones that had stayed Nicky saw Brutto's group kill the left over's only for her to see another three worker bug head towards Razak's group \"LT heads up reinforcements heading to your group.\" She then turned to Higgins and said \"Come on we have to help.\" Both got up and ran to assist, Gossard who was stood next to Dizzy heard the message they turned and opened fire killing one right away only for the second to knock Dizzy into a rock and then knock Gossard's weapon out of his hands and then knocked him down to the floor He quickly rolled to his right then to his left under the third worker bug then got up and ran, as he ran Dizzy got rid of the daze she was under picked up Gossard's rifle and went to help both Nicky and Higgins arrived just as Gossard got trapped between a cliff face and the bugs before they could help Dizzy jumped off a ledge near where Gossard was landing on one and shooting the other once it was dead she then cocking her grenade launcher of her rifle and fired it into the one she had landed on she just had time to jump away before it exploded killing the bug Once they was dead they all heard clapping looking to the right they saw the other Roughnecks clapping to them Dizzy did a curtsey and then handed Gossard his weapon back Nicky then said to Dizzy \"You sure do love doing dangerous things.\" Dizzy just replied with a smile \"Maybe a little.\" Razak then said \"Ok Roughnecks where on the clock let's get moving.\" Getting to the hole and then using the lizard line attachment then soon where deep underground once they reached the bottom they used flares to give themselves some light then Razak turned to Carl and said \"Ok Jenkins you got the road map which way.\" Carl lowered his head and concentrated a second later he raised his head and said \"This way.\" Pointing to the right passage of the three they could go to, they all started to move out Gossard walked to Carl and asked with a chuckle \"Ever thought to hire yourself out for party's?\" Carl just replied with a sarcastic \"Ha Ha.\" Just as they got started Nicky who was next to Razak said to him \"I am already not liking this.\" Razak turned to her but she quickly added \"It won't affect me sir.\" And they continued deeper underground however unknown to the squad Dizzy was starting to have a problem as she had claustrophobia not even Rico and Carl knew this so the longer they was in the bug tunnels and the deeper they went was just making it worst and worst for her Just then she heard something coming up from behind the squad turning she saw three warriors running towards them she turned and started to fire but missed and then slipped on a loose rock falling over and dropping the rifle however before the bugs could even get her Razak, Doc and Nicky opened fire killing the bugs After they were dead Razak helped Dizzy up as she said \"Sorry sir I ... er slipped.\" Razak nodded and then said and asked \"It happens trooper any injuries?\" Dizzy replied \"No sir\" then Razak added \"Ok let's move it Roughnecks them roaches are going to smell this blood and come running.\" They then double timed it a while later as they was coming up to a opening in the tunnel they was in Dizzy again started to have problems and now started to feel light headed when she groaned from it Higgins who was next to her turned and asked \"You ok?\" Dizzy trying to hide her problem replied \"Yar I'm just not at one hundred percent today but I'll be fine.\" Brutto who was in front of them turned and said \"High alert greenies ... so cut the chit chat.\" Rico who was behind Dizzy with Carl next to him said \"What's wrong with him?\" To which Carl replied \"Maybe he's jealous that he can't walk and talk at the same time.\" Making Dizzy and Rico chuckle As they got to the opening with Razak leading them they all saw it was like a giant bubble underground with many opens all over the place connected by pathways that where hollow as they had holes all over them Razak halted the squad and using his visor scanned the area What he saw troubled him a patrol of six warriors was heading towards them but he noticed a hole on the pathway just in front of them that they could use he quickly motioned the squad to move to the hole, once arriving he stepped to one side of the hole and pointed at it not needing any command Doc hopped down he was soon joined by the others only for when it came to Dizzy's turn she stalled Razak who was going to enter last motioned for her to enter with Rico who was in it also motioning for her to join them she waited for a nano-second longer then hopped down quickly followed by Razak and not a moment too soon as the patrol walked over the top of where they was Razak then passed Dizzy giving her a caution look as he headed back up to the front of the squad Dizzy then said as they went to set off again \"Man it feels like a spa in here.\" Doc turned to her and said \"Check your suit's temperate gauge you might have it turned up to high.\" Dizzy checked it but it was set to normal she held up her thumb to signal it was ok to Doc and the squad moved on however moments later Dizzy groaned again Rico turned to her and asked \"You ok Dizzy?\" Dizzy stopped and held her head then shook it and replied \"Yar I'm just not feeling too hot for a second.\" As she went to step forward to continue her foot went throw a hole in the pathway they was in braking some of it off Doc who was behind her grabbed her stopping her from going any further and said \"Watch it Dizzy.\" Nicky who was at the front with Razak and Brutto just in front of her saw throw a gap next to her a large group of warriors heading towards them she said quickly \"LT trouble's coming bug patrol heading towards us.\" Razak turned to the squad and yelled \"Prepare to engage!\" a warrior came towards them and then tried to break its way into the walkway they was in only for Razak and Brutto to gun it down and then climb out of the tunnel follow by the others The Roughnecks then opened fire killing fifteen warriors before they jumped onto another pathway that headed east to leave the hollow cavern as they went to leave Nicky turned and aiming at a higher pathway she fired her rifle under sling grenade launcher hitting it destroying it and then making it collapse onto other pathways cutting the bugs off from following them for now she then turned and quickly joined the others as they continued An hour later As they continued on Nicky who was next to Dizzy could see she was still having problems now having a sister as a medic along with her own trips to the hospital learn what to look out for as in regards to illness, phobias and injures and she knew whatever it is that is plaguing Dizzy was a phobia and having one herself she had no room to talk but she knew her sisters, brother and mother knew about it she just didn't know if Razak knew then she though on Rico and Carl of they knew if Dizzy had any fears as she went to ask them as they was just in front of her everything started to shake. After it stopped everyone was on alert and Higgins asked Rico \"What was that?\" Rico replied \"I don't know.\" Nicky then looked ahead and saw many bug warrior shadows heading there direction and yelled \"BUGS!\" Razak upon seeing the shadow also shouted \"Open fire!\" and the Roughnecks opened up on the bugs within seconds they killed ten but Razak knew there was just too many coming looking around he saw a wall that had a gap only just large enough for the Roughnecks to fit in if the crouched he then yelled \"Roughnecks fall back!\" and lead them to the wall they all quickly crouched and entered As they went deeper out of range of the warriors they was just about to rest when baby tanker bugs started to dig their way out of the wall, roof and floor, the Roughnecks started to fire and killed many of be baby tankers however Dizzy's phobia was making her not focus and fire into the roof Rico who was next to her said \"What's up Dizzy your gun sight's out of alignment?\" Before he could get a reply Dizzy's eyes glazed over and she collapsed on to the floor no one saw right away until Rico said \"A little help here Dizzy.\" Only to kick something behind himself he took a quick look then yelled \"Trooper down!\" Nicky quickly went to Dizzy and went to drag her to safety when the gap they was in which lead to a large open area which they was going to use to regroup the ground opened up to reveal a adult tanker Now the Roughnecks where trapped between the baby tankers to their left and the adult to their right Rico knelt next to Dizzy trying to wake her up Doc, Brutto and Gossard shot at the adult tanker to keep it busy, while Nicky, Carl and Higgins fired at the baby's with Razak in the middle near Rico It looked like the end when Gossard saw a crack behind near Nicky and said \"LT stress point.\" and Razak yelled \"Blast it!\" Gossard turned and fired his grenade launcher blowing a hole large enough for the squad to get throw as the dust settled Razak then said \"Nicky help Rico with Dizzy while Gossard help myself, Brutto and Doc keep the bugs busy.\" Higgins and Carl went through the gap first followed by Rico and Nicky dragging the out of it Dizzy they was then quickly followed by Razak and co, just as they all entered the adult tanker fired a stream of fire down the tunnel they was killing all of the baby tankers that where trying to follow the force of the fire made a small explosion which caused the ground to shake under the Roughnecks then give way making them slide down to another tunnel and come to a stop near the edge of it over looking a larger tunnel and walkway After they got there bearings Doc went over to where Rico, Nicky and the out of it Dizzy was and a plug in wire attached it to Dizzy's suit she he could use his to see what was wrong After a few seconds he said \"Nothing in the suit registers any injures or anything else that maybe wrong with her.\" Razak then asked \"Is there anything you can do for her?\" to the reply of \"Tranqs but she would then have to be carried out of here.\" Razak not liking it turned to Carl and asked \"Jenkins see if you can find out what's wrong.\" He nodded and walked to prone Dizzy with Rico knelt next to her and placed his hands on her head a second later he grunted and then said \"Ar I know now claustrophobia.\" Brutto then angrily said \"She's afraid of being in closed places do you think she could of told us before we was trapped in a bug infested hide out.\" Nicky who was stood checking the area turned and answered back \"Back off sarge we all have our own secrets that we have not spoken of yet to the squad I should know as I too have a phobia.\" Brutto and the others were shocked however Razak didn't but Nicky then turned to Carl and asked \"Is there anything you can do for her to get her up and able?\" He replied with an unsure \"I don't know.\" Rico then said \"Could you plant a hypo-surjection into her head?\" Carl replied \"I've only done it with animals never a person.\" Higgins then asked curiously \"What's the difference?\" Turning to face him Carl replied \"I could hurt her permanently.\" Just then they all heard a load roar and a scream from different types of bugs and Razak said \"There's no other choice if you don't it could hurt this squad permanently\" Carl nodded and then he placed his hands onto Dizzy's head a few seconds later he let go and held his own as Dizzy then groaned and started to wake up and she looked around and saw the rest of the squad she asked \"What's going on?\" Rico sighed in relief and said \"Welcome back Dizzy.\" It didn't take long for it to sink in and Dizzy said \"Oh no.\" She then turned to Razak and said \"LT I'm sorry.\" Razak angrily said \"Private by not reviling your phobia you have put this whole squad at risk.\" He then paused to let it sink into her then add \"Move out.\" As everyone started to move out Nicky heard Dizzy say to Carl \"So you was in my head?\" he nodded then she asked \"So the fear it's all gone like forever?\" Carl replied \"Probably not you'll need a buster shot or something at some point.\" Dizzy stood up and then asked \"So what was it like being inside my head?\" Carl chuckled as he replied with a smile \"Scary.\" Dizzy also chuckled and punched him in the shoulder. They crossed over the walkway and came to another hollowed cavern that had a large ball hanging from the roof with a large drop to the floor which had two large tunnel opening joining it Higgins then saw something in an opening to the ball and said \"What's that?\" the ball had bridges connecting to many holes and coming out of the one Higgins pointing at was a hopper Nicky opened fire killing it only for more hoppers to come out of other holes and the others soon opened fire killing a few while others were able to take flight One was lucky enough to get though the incoming fire and hit Rico in the back knocking he close to the edge it was soon killed but Rico was able to see coming out of one of the ground tunnels a large group of warrior and worker bugs and a plasma bug Rico turned and said \"LT we got trouble plasma and warriors from the ground.\" Razak then ordered \"Brake contact and advance!\" everyone started to run across the bridge in front of them as they got half way the plasma bug fired destroying the pathway they had just crossed and throwing Gossard forward as he was bringing up the rear he landed on his face next to where Nicky was stood she turned to him and asked \"You ok Gossard?\" he stood up nodding and said \"I'm ok.\" They then restarted to open fire killing more hoppers when Brutto then took a look down and saw the plasma bug about to take another shoot at them he then yelled \"INBOUND!\" Razak then said \"brake off and clime.\" Everyone shouldered their rifles and unhooked the lizard line guns and fired them into a far of wall and jumped as the plasma bug fired destroying the hopper hive and making the roof collapse showing open sky and a large bit of the roof landing and killing the plasma bug As they all reached the wall Nicky turned looking at the kills then at the roof she then turned to Razak who was next to her and said \"Do you think we will be given credit for any of this when we get back?\" Brutto who landed on the opposite side of her replied \"If we find bug city too maybe.\" Razak then said \"Ok Roughnecks lets go Nicky your on point.\" Nicky nodded and they all headed up and out of the hole they had made as they quickly moved away from it Gossard stopped turned taking a T.O.A.D charge out of his pack he set the time on it for three minutes and then throw it back into the hole they had just left they all quickly took cover as it soon exploded killing the bugs trying to climb out of it and many more under the ground Nicky saw the big ball of fire going up into the air she turned to Gossard and said \"You must really love being our demolition expert.\" Gossard just chuckled then Doc said \"Er LT I think you should see this.\" The Roughnecks joined him as he added \"We found bug city.\" And for as far as the eye could see the ground was just covered in eggs everywhere Razak quickly checked their location and then called in the bombing run Within moments the Roughnecks saw thundercat bombers come in and level the whole area where the eggs where Nicky jumped in the air with a yell \"YES!\" then continued \"We win this bug's better luck next time.\" Everyone else was also cheering in victory only to stop when they heard a roar turning what they saw shocked them Heading to where the eggs use to be was the biggest bug any of them had ever seen at least the same size as one of the fleet's spaceships it then came past them and landed Nicky seeing this thought *What the blue hell is that thing?* she turned and said \"Anyone got a clue what this thing is?\" They then saw slits all along the creature's side open up and warrior and worker bugs walked out of it while from higher ones hoppers taking to the air some hoppers landed and placed new eggs onto the ground soon it's slits closed and then out of its back four giant wings two going straight up and two going to the sides and in on motion with the ones going straight up coming down it lifted itself up of the ground and then started to head higher and higher until they saw it heading to space Dizzy turned to Razak and asked \"What are we to do LT?\" Razak immediately got back on the radio to call this in *\"Blue Leader this is Razak alpha team I need you to re-bomb this sector as a new bug has just dropped off new forces and we need immediate retrieval.\"* Blue Leader gave an immediate response *\"We saw it passed close to the TFF San Dargo command is in an up roar we are getting a small force together to give chase.\"* Nicky heard what was said and asked Razak \"LT is that wise?\" Razak nodded to her and said \"I believe so that bug maybe heading back to the bugs home planet or to another planet to get more forces.\" Just then a retrieval ship arrived and picked them up just as they took off another bomber wing arrived and re-bombed the area killing the new forces that had been dropped off Within three hours all troopers from the Valley Forge was back aboard getting ready to leave Pluto's space and chase after the code named 'transport bug' to where ever it is going The Valley Forge and the Gettysburg where going to be the only troop carrying ships going along with a defence force of four frigates and four heavy transports Nicky sat in the bunkroom for the Roughnecks as the ship got ready to go looking out of the window to where Pluto was getting smaller and smaller as they left she then though to herself *This is the second time I've had to leave this planet and not being able to finish cleaning it of the bugs although this time it's to see where that transport bug came from hopeful it's there home.* She then reaches for her dog tags around her neck looking at the pair she wore while in the Screaming Eagles and her newer ones for being with the Roughnecks Nicky laid down on her bunk and stared at the ceiling of the room and then said to herself \"I hope we find out where that bug is going quickly so we can end this war with the bugs not killing any more people.\" She yarned and went to sleep as the ship left Pluto in pursuit of the transport bug.

Through the quiet period in grade school where the boy kept himself to himself and barely spoke, through high school where he slowly began to come out of his shell, his personality not always accepted, but his confidence that someone would befriend him was endearing - sweet even. He didn't let peer pressure get the better of him and did his own thing, at his own pace. That was before college and smoking pot got in the way. Dana never really talked to him past a few quick greetings in the hallway but she was concerned about his glassy stare and lazy drawn out syllables and failure to care when he got to class 20 mins in and proceeded to fall asleep on the desk. Marty may have been a lot of things, but a stoner wasn't one of them. Something must have happened. She wasn't sure what - she didn't know a lot about his family, she knew he had at least one younger sister - Sally - and an older brother maybe? She couldn't remember his name though. So it was that at the start of summer vacation, Jules' boyfriend Kurt proposed a trip to his cousin's cabin somewhere in the north east, just inland in the state of Washington and they were all invited. Jules had been going on for ages about Kurt's football friend who was miraculously smart, athletic and cute and she thought him and Dana would be the perfect match. Dana reluctantly agreed to come along, figuring it was something different to do and if it was that bad she could get some studying done for the fall. Jules appeared at her apartment mid-morning thurs with a go-to attitude and brand new blonde hair. \"Don't you love it?!\" She gushed, sashaying her way round Dana's bedroom. The red-head admitted it was quite a shock. \"You're going to love Holden. He's so cute! And smart too.\" Dana smiled and nodded awkwardly, wishing there was less pressure to hook up with this one boy. And then Kurt blundered in, in his normal larger than life style. \"Dana.\" He nodded politely, his hands wrapped around a football as he moved towards Jules restlessly. They had been dating off and on for the whole of freshman year. Dana presumed things were 'on' at the moment and it was affirmed when Kurt transferred the ball to one hand and wrapped both arms possessively around Jules' waist. She hoped she wasn't in the room next to them. They berated her about her studies for a minute, then Dana finished packing and they headed down to the camper and Holden, who smiled and introduced himself. She smiled back - Jules was right, he was cute - and moved to put get things in the van. It was then that Marty arrived, smoking a huge bong while driving and Dana felt her heart sink. What had he turned into? She barely looked at him - his eyes were cloudy and unseeing anyway - and climbed into the vehicle without uttering a word. She sat in the back, listening to them banter outside, the morning light filtering in through the window and warming her skin. It was nice to be going somewhere, to be doing something different. She was looking forward to just relaxing and not worrying about school and grades and society bothering her about the whole teacher-student scandal. This way she could think about it in peace and decide what she wanted out of future relationships. Not that it had been a relationship. But it had sure felt like one at the time. Until he'd opened up about his actual relationship with his real-life wife and she had realised what a fool she had been to presume he was available and that if he wasn't, that he would have been man enough to tell her before he'd taken her virginity. Alas. The red-haired girl sighed and allowed herself to wallow, perhaps for the first time - and only for a few seconds - in the sadness of it, the unfairness of it all, the anger at her pathetic naivety. She was a walking fucking cliche. Next time she would know better. Next time. At this point she felt a presence at her right shoulder about the same time the camper shuddered into life. Marty had decided to take the seat beside her. His eyes were on her but she didn't meet his gaze. She couldn't bare seeing him so doped up, it made her want to cry. \"Let's blow this joint!\" Kurt hollered from the other side. \"Amen to that, brother.\" Murmured Marty. He was so close she could feel the heat from his body and the light tickle of his plaid shirt when they turned a corner. The others wooped and cheered and Holden turned up the radio and careened down the road. Dana closed her eyes, inhaling and exhaling slowly, willing herself to relax. She could do this. She didn't have to get upset about Marty. What did she know anyway? Maybe being stoned all the time was the best way to live. He was probably really happy. She pried an eye open and glanced sideways at the boy. He had shut his eyes and tilted his head back. He'd probably passed out. He looked worn and tired. The bags underneath his eyes were an unhealthy shade of violet and he had clearly not shaved in a few days. His dirty blonde hair was a bit longer but pretty much the same as she remembered it being in school. They had been friends once, but that was a long time ago now. \"How're you doin' Dana?\" Dana was startled into a blush. Marty clearly wasn't asleep. He peeled his eyes open and pulled one side of his mouth up in a weary-looking smile. She nodded several times to many. \"Good, good thanks. How are you? It's - it's been a while since we...spoke.\" The red-headed girl looked away as she finished the sentence, struggling with her old friend's hazy bloodshot gaze. \"True that.\" His eyes swung a pathway to Kurt and Jules engaged in a passionate kiss over the back of the former's chair. Dana felt compelled to repeat herself, tucking her hair self-consciously behind her ear. \"How are you doing?\" \"Yeah, yeah pretty good.\" His blue-green eyes found hers again. He narrowed them. \"You look g...ood. Um, I mean...you look pretty...uh...healthy...\" He went pink and stared determinedly at the floor. \"Um...\" \"What are you two mumbling about? Has Dana told you about Holden? Don't you think he's cute?!\" Dana was positive her face was the same shade as her hair. \"Jules...please don't.\" \"Okay, I'm sorry, I just wanted to know if you thought he was cute or not.\" She flounced back around to Kurt who was busy singing loud and off key to the radio. Holden was laughing at him, hopefully unaware of the conversation. \"I think you hurt her feelings.\" Marty said mildly. Dana did smile at this. \"I think she'll survive.\" They shared a smirk and Dana felt herself relax a little bit. \"Oh I dunno, if she doesn't make it through Kurt may have to give her mouth to mouth. In fact - there you are -.\" He waved a hand at the couple who were again passionately making out. \"It was touch and go for a while.\" He smiled somewhat desperately at Dana, realising it was a bad joke but ploughing through it anyway. She giggled, because it was kind of funny. \"Kurt is always there to save the day.\" She agreed. Marty nodded. \"You know, it seems weird but I never saw them hooking up. Well - maybe at parties and shit. But not...permanently.\" Dana watched her friends exchanging saliva thoughtfully. \"I dunno. Kurt was always crushing on Jules. I told him she was a med student and wasn't gonna settle for one man anytime soon but he ignored me.\" \"And made an honest woman of her.\" Dana chuckled. \"It took long enough. I swear she made out with half the guys on campus. No wonder she had a bad reputation.\" \"She was my first crush.\" \"Really? When was that?\" \"10th grade biology. I was awful. We ended up on the same project and all I could think about was how cute and energetic she was. I couldn't believe she was popular AND smart. It seemed too good to be true.\" \"What happened?\" \"She kissed me over a dissected sheep's heart. It was pure poetry.\" Dana's brow creased and a perplexed smile tugged at her lips. Interesting. Dana had mentioned it a few times because she thought it was funny, but hearing it from Marty's point of view was sweet. \"Hmmm...how romantic.\" \"I thought so. The cold White lights of the lab illuminating our happy, innocent faces, the dead, bloody animal organ lying there on the table between us...\" She giggled. \"That's horrible!\" \"Hey! I was young and naive. Besides, don't knock it 'til you've tried it.\" He winked and Dana made a face, biting back her laughter. \"Oh god! Marty!\" She hit him playfully, \"That's disgusting.\" \"What stories are you telling poor Dana? You know she's too fragile to handle our little escapades.\" Jules butted in teasingly. \"Hey! I can handle it. I'm not made of glass.\" \"Mentally, Dana, mentally.\" Marty tapped his temple. She rolled her eyes. \"We were discussing your escapades, Jules.\" \"Nothing good I hope.\" \"How many people d'you reckon you've like...kissed?\" Piped up Marty. The blonde girl's eyebrows shot up and she stared off into the distance for a moment, chewing her fingernail. Then she refocussed on them and actually laughed awkwardly. \"I dunno...I think I'd have to make a list.\" The two others silently judged her and she flushed, flipping her hair back and glaring at them. \"I've kissed a lot of people ok! Marty should know, he was one of them.\" \"You haven't kissed me.\" Shot back Dana, them immediately regretted it. Marty burst out laughing. \"Are you offering?\" Asked Jules seductively. \"N-No!\" \"Have you ever kissed a girl before?\" Mortified, Dana shut her mouth and refused to answer. Kurt turned around, curious. \"What's going on back there?\" \"Dana wants to know why we haven't made out-.\" \"Will you-.\" \"She's too chicken to do it, that's why.\" \"Look, you're not being fair. She's my friend. It would be REALLY weird.\" \"Told you. She's too chicken.\" \"And she's a girl.\" \"So if she was a guy, you would do it then?\" Dana closed her eyes and prayed for release. \"You guys are awful. I'm going to the bathroom.\" Ignoring the catcalls and shouts of 'chicken!' the redhead made a swift exit. Sat on the toilet with the lid down for 5 mins then flushed it and made to leave.[Chapter 2] Marty was outside, clearly waiting to go in. Standing, they were almost at eye-level. His eyes were very dark green underneath the curtain of blonde hair. \"Hey.\" He said, flashing a one-sided grin. \"Hey.\" There wasn't much room in the corridor between the bathroom and the shower. They were very close together and Marty had to squeeze out of the way so she could get out. \"Thanks.\" Dana made her way back to her seat and joined the conversation which had somehow branched into sex stories, which it often did. Since she only had one, she stared at the passing shrubbery, trying to ignore them. \"I heard you hooked up with the prof, Dana.\" The red-haired girl pointedly pretended to be vividly interested in the blurry landscape whizzing by. She wasn't getting into this until she had consumed at least two bottles of cheap wine. \"Dana?\" \"Leave her be, Kurt, she doesn't want to talk about it.\" Came Jules' quiet but authoritative rebuke. \"The whole campus is talking about it!\" Pause, probably accompanied by daggers from his girlfriend. \"Fine.\" \"I haven't heard about it.\" Marty's voice was louder from her right. \"That's because you live in a pot haze, Marty.\" Reprimanded the blonde. He didn't reply to that. Dana knew her face must be an unhappy mask because she had always been terrible at hiding her emotions. \"What happened?\" Marty carried on. \"Marty! She's right there.\" \"I know that, I just...\" He trailed off uncomfortably and Dana felt his eyes on her but she didn't let herself give in. Yes she would almost certainly talk about it - extensively with crying and cursing and fully-clothed showers - but not now. The first half of the journey was relaxed. Kurt took some of the driving to give Holden a rest and the boy was immediately interrogated by Jules - where was he from? Why did he transfer? Did he have any skeletons in his closet? Dana had known Jules for long enough to be embarrassed for her, not because of her. The girl was all good intentions but no thought. She acted out of instinct - what you saw was what you got. Holden seemed slightly taken aback but took it all in his stride which, out of anything she'd seen him do, made Dana respect him. After Jules grilled him on his entire study plan and his history with the team, Dana decided it was time to step in. \"Jules, this isn't a homicide case, why don't you stop with the backstory.\" The blonde bit back whatever question she was going to ask next and smiled bashfully. \"I was just being friendly!\" \"It's ok, really,\" Holden consoled her, \"I don't mind.\" He had a cute smile, and Dana felt herself warming to his all-round good guy act. Next to her, Marty was actually asleep this time. His breathing was soft and regular, tiny snores erupting every once in a while. They reached a gas station but Dana didn't have the heart to wake him. The bags underneath his eyes said he needed the rest. Holden hovered half a metre away as she leafed through some magazines obliviously. \"Hey,\" he began awkwardly, but the red-haired girl was engrossed in the journal so he had to try again. He said her name and she looked up. She had such huge blue eyes. \"What - what are you studying? I think Jules said but...\" \"Art. And sociology. And art history. What about you?\" \"Politics, economics and business.\" \"Wow, that's quite a lineup!\" \"I guess...\" \"How do you know Kurt?\" \"Football. I was the new guy and we hit it off pretty much straight away.\" Dana nodded understandingly just as Marty came stumbling sleepily into the store, hair sticking up in random places where he'd ran his hand through it. His eyes focussed on Dana and Holden and he waved a vague hand. \"Caffeine. Need caffeine.\" He stated hoarsely and shuffled off in the direction of the fridge. Dana laughed. \"Marty, what a character.\" \"Quite. Driving with a bong was pretty impressive.\" \"Yeah, I guess. Kinda stupid though.\" They shared a knowing smile before they were cannonballed by Kurt and Jules, loaded with candy, chips and soda galore. \"Let's roll guys! Marty, get that sweet ass over here.\" \"My sweet ass will be with you in two minutes!\" \"Well hurry it up, we're leaving!\" The small blonde man trundled past, arms cradling a selection of iced coffees, muttering to himself about 'having a little patience.' \"Do you need some help there, Marty?\" Dana reached out to grab some of the more precarious-looking bottles from the pile and the blonde's mouth turned up at the corners gratefully. \"Thanks Dana.\" \"No problem!\" She followed him to checkout and helped him deposit the drinks on the counter. Marty dumped a fist full of change next to them. \"Three cartons of your cheapest cigarettes, my good lady.\" The cashier looked a little confused at Marty's way of talking but complied to his request. Dana guessed she was used to it, but he did sound like he was from medieval Britain sometimes. Back in the camper, the party was back on and Jules wanted to sit next to Dana, who had offered to drive the next bit. Marty was forced to sit behind Jules while Holden and Kurt talked football at the table. \"Sooo...you and Holden were getting pretty cosy in there.\" The blonde began conspiratorially after they had been driving for a few minutes. Dana sighed. Why did Jules always make such a big deal of things? \"We were just talking, Jules.\" \"Yeah, but you like him, right?\" \"Look, I dunno. I'm not sure I'm ready for whatever you think...this is.\" \"So it's a thing?!\" \"Yes...no! Jules, do you think you leave me to make up my own mind, if that's at all possible?\" Jules let out her breath explosively and sat back dramatically in her seat. \"I'm just trying to help, Dana. After that whole professor blah blah whatever, you really need to, like, move on already!\" \"Stop trying to force me into it! It was a...bad time for me, ok? I'll get there at my own pace.\" \"Ok, ok, I'm done. Whatever happens from now on is all down to you.\" \"Thanks.\" \"That's ok. I'm sorry I'm so pushy sometimes. I just want you to be happy with hot Holden!\" She winked delightedly and Dana rolled her eyes. It was a bit of a roller-coaster ride being friends with Jules, but she always had the best intentions. \"I'll get there, Jules. At least give me some alcohol first!\" \"Yes! This is going to be so much fun.\" Switching her gaze back and forth between Jules and the road, Dana saw a look that could only be described as 'sneaky' pass across her friend's face. Oh dear. \"Oh no. I don't like that look. What are you planning?\" \"You know better than to ask me that, Dana.\" \"Yeah, but Jules-.\" \"Nope.\" \"But-.\" \"Na-ah.\" \"Y-you just said-.\" \"Stop. I have an idea. And it might just work.\" Dana sighed, her heart sagging in her chest. \"Oh god. Don't you dare...dare me to make out with him. It's not gonna happen.\" Jules laughed loudly. \"That's not what I was thinking, but that would be really funny.\" Dana groaned. \"I'm just gonna shut up, cause clearly I can't talk without giving you ideas.\" The red-haired girl spent the rest of the journey not mentioning Holden or Professor Manning or anything to do with men in general. Marty offered to drive, but, unconvinced of his sobriety, Dana declined. He looked hurt, but she didn't think too much about it because it was still her choice and if he was too stoned to drive, then she would be putting them all in danger if she let him. They reached the cabin sometime around 10 in the evening. Dana was half tempted to go straight to bed after five hours of driving and, to be honest, everyone seemed quite keen on having alone time. Ten hours in an enclosed space together was somewhat intense.[Chapter 3] She said goodnight, gathered her stuff from the van and headed to her room which was coincidentally next to Holden's. Oh Jules, she just couldn't leave things alone could she? Poor Marty. He was stuck next to the happy couple. He wouldn't get much sleep tonight. Unpacking her belongings methodically, Dana placed her night stuff on the bed. Looking for her toothbrush and absently brushing her hair at the same time she came across a pack of earplugs she'd packed in case of emergencies. Aha! She should give them to Marty, it might help him sleep. The red head changed into some corridor- appropriate pjs, which weren't really much more than a t-shirt and track pants, grabbed her towel and wash-bag and the earplugs and headed to the bathroom. Someone was in it already, or rather two someones. She could hear the giggling and muffled thumping of various body parts hitting the walls of the shower cubicle. Great. She rolled her eyes and made a u-turn back to Marty's room, knocking on the door. There was no answer. She knocked again. \"Marty?\" Still no answer. Maybe he had gone to bed already. She turned to go when the door opened and Holden poked his head out. \"Oh! Holden! I'm sorry, I thought this was Marty's room. Sorry to bother you!\" \"No problem, is everything ok?\" He pulled the door a little wider, revealing his very naked torso. A very naked, very attractively muscled torso. Dana felt herself flush and opened her mouth to give an explanation but nothing came out. Wow. Okay. Words would be really handy right now. Holden was fighting a smile, amusement leaking into his dark blue eyes. \"Are you ok?\" Dana ran a hand helplessly through her hair and smiled, eyes earnestly apologising to replace the lack of actual words. \"Yeah, yeah. Do you know where...?\" Holden allowed a grin to get out this time and pointed down the corridor to the door next to Kurt and Jules'. God, you'd think she'd be capable of navigating her way around four rooms. She nodded at Holden, thanked him with a thumbs up and walked quickly to Marty's door, knocking a little frantically. A few seconds passed, so she knocked again and this time there was a scuffle of footsteps and Marty eased the door open, his hair haphazardly over his face, the bags more pronounced than ever in the dull lights of the cabin. He looked exhausted. She immediately felt bad and began apologising before she could even explain why she was there. Marty's eyebrows came together and he squinted at her, eventually pulling his hair out of his face so he could focus on her. She was so adorable with her curling auburn hair and mesmerising blue eyes, towel thrown over one shoulder, various girl-implements clutched in her pale hands as she brandished something at him. It suddenly occurred to him he should focus on what she was saying. Something about earplugs and sleeping. Oh yeah, he was next to Kurt and Jules. Dana had a good point. \"Earplugs.\" He echoed after she had finished apologising profusely and he could reply. He took the small packet she was waving like a sparkler in the air around his chin. \"That's so very awesome of you, my ears will thank you tomorrow. Also my mental state may stay...relatively intact. Thanks, Dana.\" \"No worries!\" \"G'night. Sleep well.\" \"Goodnight Marty.\" Dana breathed a sigh of relief when he closed the door. She was such a klutz sometimes, it was a wonder people didn't lose their patience more often with her rambling and appalling conversation making. She readjusted her towel and went back to her room to wait for the shower. She was petty tired, she could feel her muscles begging her to lie down but she sat on the end of the bed instead and watched the corridor for signs of Jules and Kurt stumbling back to their room. Ten minutes passed and Dana began to worry she was going to pass out on the bed so she got up and joined the two man queue outside the bathroom. Or one man, really, as Marty was asleep, sat sprawled against the wall. \"Good company you got there.\" She said jokingly. Holden, who was clearly determined not to wear a shirt, was leaning casually against the plaster, towel slung over one stupidly perfect shoulder. A grin spread across his face. \"Yeah I know.\" \"Are those guys still in there?\" \"Yeah...\" \"Shouldn't we ask them to...get a move on?\" \"I guess...\" They both looked at the closed door then back at each other. It wasn't worth the effort really. God only knows what they were doing in there. Dana debated internally for a moment, coming to the conclusion that Jules and Kurt really were being selfish by hogging the only bathroom and knocked on the door. \"Jules? Kurt?\" No answer. Just a lot of giggling to the baseline of running water. She knocked again, louder. \"Jules? Are you guys alive in there?\" Still nothing. Then suddenly Marty appeared next to her. He took no quarter with his knocking and rapped mercilessly, following this with: \"Guys! Guys! Some other people would like to use the bathroom too, you know! We want to get clean and you only want to get dirty! You have a bed for all that...\" His eyes met Dana's and he twisted his mouth into an bashful one-sided smile, \"Jazz...\" He finished awkwardly. There was some banging of doors and squeaking of bare feet on tiles and Jules came tumbling out, looking surprisingly clean if a little bit rosy-cheeked. \"Alright, alright, there's no need to get your panties in a twist!\" She proclaimed, almost falling into Marty, who stepped back reflexively about the same time his hands came out to stop her. \"Apart from you, Marty, you definitely need your panties twisted juuust a little bit.\" She leered into his personal space, all mussed blonde hair and fiery blue eyes. Marty's expression was some sort of combination of surprised and confused as hell. Dana reached over to usher her away just as Kurt blundered out of the bathroom door and scooped Jules, shrieking like a chimpanzee, into his arms and down the corridor. \"I'm so happy you gave me those earplugs.\" Uttered Marty fervently, as the screaming continued into the bedroom. \"Me too.\" Dana agreed. \"Who...was next in line for the bathroom?\" \"You. Go.\" Said the blonde, pushing her into the shower stall affectionately. \"Hey! No way! I was last in the queue-.\" Marty shut the door in her face, chuckling to himself when she pushed feebly to get it open. \"You guys are jerks!\" She shouted through the wood with one last shove at the door. They were both laughing now so she gave up, locked the door and pulled off her pjs angrily. Why did they always have to be so macho about this shit, they were here first fair and square! Fine, well she was going to be quick. She turned on the water, washed her hair and body in record time, wrapped the towel snugly around her and stalked out to both boys stood chatting in the corridor. \"I'm done.\" She said shortly, turned and practically fell into bed - barely having the energy to drag her pjs back on before she felt sleep overcome her. The next morning came bright and early - thankfully quite warm and sunny despite the colder climate. Dana meandered into the kitchen, feeling surprisingly well-rested and content as she filled the kettle. \"Dana!\" \"Morning Marty! Coffee?\" \"Is that the crappy instant kind that tastes like regurgitated dog testicles?\" She nodded. \"Pour me a cup.\" She laughed and got out another mug from the cupboard. \"Sugar? Milk?\" He nodded, thumbs up. \"Thank you very much, my good friend.\" Something suddenly occurred to the red-head as she filled the cups, watching Marty stare intently out of the window, the sunlight filtering through onto his figure, allowing her to notice his freshly shaven face and more clean and ordered- looking hair which looked more artfully messy than unkempt. \"Marty, what colour are your eyes? I can't figure it out.\" Marty was jerked out of his reverie as this random question and he turned to her, surprised. \"My eyes? Uh...\" He pushed at his hair self-consciously, avoiding her gaze as the tops of her cheekbones coloured slightly and she hurriedly made up the coffee and shoved it at him. \"I guess they're...green? Blue? Kind of blue-y green?\" He looked up to meet her eyes, knowing she was probably going to study them now. Hers were just blue. No random weird colours there. She smiled, her cheeks dimpling. \"They look more green to me.\" At this point Jules appeared in a t-shirt and nothing else, hair attractively tousled, eyes shining. You didn't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what she had been doing. \"Morning guys!\" They chorused greetings back to her and sat around the table to plan their day. Basically they decided to go to the lake for a bit then start partying. It was a pretty foolproof plan. They all changed into their costumes and grabbed a cooler and headed down. Marty refused point-blank to swim, donning a long-sleeved top and jeans and sitting on the pier with his feet in the water, joint in one hand, beer in the other. Kurt wasn't going to be outdone, however, and tried to pull him in several times, eventually succeeding - they managed to drag his shirt off with him protesting loudly and trying to hold his joint above the water. Everyone was in hysterics. Dana swam over and grabbed the joint off him, feeling silly and childish, and put it to her lips, watching a look of shock pass over his face as she took a long drag, kicking with her legs to keep her head above water. \"Smoke?\" She asked innocently, and he narrowed his eyes at her, trying to dislodge Kurt and plough through the water with his beer clutched in one hand. She moved away tauntingly and he eventually stopped to down the beer. Dropping the bottle, he swam determinedly after her and Dana realised she was in trouble. \"Hey - hey - aaaah!\" Marty water-tackled her, taking her by the wrist and wrestling the joint off her as she attempted feebly to kick him away. The joint didn't survive. The anger in the blonde's eyes soon dissolved into laughter as he held up the mushy joint and Dana joined in, splashing him playfully. He spluttered indignantly and grabbed her ankles, pulling her under as she screamed. They fought for a few minutes, then Marty called a ceasefire and retreated, shouting abuse at them all the way to the pier. There, he pulled himself onto the ledge, swore at Kurt and opened another beer, downing it in record time. \"You're all unfeeling, selfish, primitive sons of bitches you know that?!\" With that he lay back in the sun.[Chapter 4] Holden came up behind Dana and pushed her under. Taken by surprise, she accidentally elbowed him in the face, splitting his lip. \"Ah!\" He cursed. Dana clapped her hands to her mouth in horror. \"Oh my god! Holden I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Are you ok?!\" He put his hand over his face and it came away bloody, but he was grinning. \"Don't worry about it Dana, I've had worse.\" Her eyes looked exceptionally blue against her wet hair. She looked so guilty he thought it was adorable and took the opportunity to plant a kiss on her pale cheek. \"Payback.\" She smiled shyly, face reddening and turned in the water, swimming to the side to unearth another beer from the cooler. There she hoisted herself up, showering a disgruntled Marty with lake water in the process. \"Why are you getting me wet again?\" He complained mildly, then giggled for no apparent reason. He was still shirtless and damp; his hair drying into it's familiar bedraggled mess. A recently-lit spliff was clutched in long fingers and his eyes were hazy. \"Oh sshh.\" Dana reprimanded lightly, smiling at him. \"Don't ssshhhh me, woman, I am man therefore I am...superior...\" He snorted to himself again. Dana rolled her eyes. There was no talking to him when he was like this. \"You're such a dick when you're high.\" \"I am...not! Dana, you lie...\" \"Marty, you were just a sexist prick.\" He inhaled dramatically. \"Ha ha, I was joking...\" \"Well, it wasn't funny.\" She left her beer on the ledge and lowered herself fluidly back into the water. \"Dana. Dana! I'm sorry I'm -.\" The redhead swiped the beer and paddled backwards, somehow managing not to look at him as she did it. \"Really baked...\" He finished off to himself, flopping back on the pier defeated. He took a long drag of his joint and grinned dreamily. \"Well if you aren't the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.\" He told the sky. \"You're - you're blue like...daisies.\" He murmured blissfully. The evening saw the five young adults partying hard in their cabin in the woods. Several bottles of wine were scattered across the table in various stages of consumption. Beer cans and bottles alike were piled in creative-looking sculptures on the floor. Chips and candy littered the sofas, wet patches where liquids had been spilled put the final touches to the background. Now for the occupants. Kurt was sat on one armchair with Jules pulled across his lap. Marty was sprawled in the other one while Dana and Holden were sat awkwardly next to each other on the sofa. Marty dared Jules to make out with a stuffed wolf's head, then they wandered around the basement for a bit. Finally Jules and Kurt retired to their room for some 'alone time' and Dana, Holden and Marty were left to their own devices. Holden had been thinking about kissing Dana all night. The more drunk he became, the better the idea seemed. She hadn't said anything about him kissing her at the lake and she was single, which was always a good start. He'd heard rumours of a sucky situation with a professor but he wasn't expecting any more than a kiss, if that was all she was ready for. He wasn't a bad guy - he would go as far as the girl wanted and no more. She was in control. He watched her as she stared blankly at the table, fingers wrapped around a quarter bottle of rose. She must have felt him looking at her because she looked up and smiled sweetly, her eyes so very large and blue, lighting up. This was the moment. And he leaned in slowly. The smile faded, and a look of confusion pulled her lips into a tight line. He put his hand out to touch her cheek, to tell her he wanted this, but she turned her face away, shutting him off, her eyes downcast and her body lines rigid with misery. Holden brought his hand back quickly and bit his lip in consternation. \"I - I'm sorry, I just thought...\" He must have really misread all the signs. This girl didn't want him. He sat back against the sofa cushions as she got to her feet, moved her hair distractedly back from her face with a trembling hand, muttering: \"I'm just gonna...g-g-go to the bathroom.\" And tottering unsteadily out of the room. Holden sat for a moment longer, then headed to bed so he could rest his addled, drunken mind. Marty followed the boy's progress with his glazed eyes. Drinking and smoking was such a bad idea sometimes. He couldn't get his brain to just...do things. He needed little neon arrows to get him from a to b. Puppet strings to make his limbs respond in the appropriate order at the appropriate times. On that thought, he decided to have a nap, and woke up 30 mins later fuzzy and disorientated and somewhat more sober. There was no-one there. Where had everybody gone? Had they all gone to bed? He really needed to empty his bladder. Stumbling over to the bathroom, he threw open the door to a boatload of steam and the drumming noise of water on the tiles. \"Hello?\" No answer. He tried again. \"Hellooo?\" He really needed to pee. He sorted himself out, rinsed his hands and went over to cautiously knock on the shower door, before realising it was very slightly ajar. \"Hello?\" He very slowly pushed it open, and was greeted by a torrent of spray. He put his hand out to protect his eyes and squinted past it to see if there was anyone there. There was. It was Dana. And she was clearly upset, soaking wet and curled up with her arms around her knees as the shower rained down on her. The wine bottle stood empty next to her left foot. Marty didn't know what to do. He approached her carefully, as though she was a wounded bird, and knelt down in the shower stream, putting his hand gently on her shoulder as he felt the warm water soak through his clothes, skin, run down his face into his eyes, which he cleared away frustratedly with his free arm. \"Dana.\" He shook her softly, \"Dana. I think it's time to stop now.\" \"Wha - what are you -?\" She tried to open her eyes, but water poured in so she closed them again. \"Why are you-?\" Her hand came up to shield her face as she tried to figure out who had disturbed her. Here she was trying to wallow in her pain but nope - someone had to come in and crash the party. God she was so...angry! She pushed the hand away but it two came back, one on either shoulder and there was a face close to hers enunciating very calm, practical advice but she was upset and furious and everything that had happened with Manning and the school and with Holden came flooding back and she wrenched the arms off of her, shouting at him to leave her alone but he wouldn't and she began to weep again. \"Dana. Dana. Please don't cry. You have to get up now. You - you really can't stay in the shower forever. I'm sorry.\" He was so fucking calm and rational. Marty was never any of these things. And for some reason this pissed her off mightily and she slapped him messily across the face, water and all. Then she shook her finger at him with every word. \"You leave me alone Martin Mikalski. I don't want you in my life, d'you hear me?\" Through the haze of steam she saw shock colour his funny coloured eyes and pain lance through them but she was too tired, too angry and drunk to care. She just wanted peace and quiet. Marty stood slowly and squelched out of the cubicle, not really sure how to take this new development in their friendship. He was dripping - literally sopping wet from head to toe - his cheek was stinging where she had hit him. For a small girl she had some swing on her. He turned doggedly in his door, then stopped short, realising he still didn't want Dana to be alone, crying in the shower and that even if she didn't want him she would have someone take care of her - someone she couldn't refuse. He turned heavily and stomped up to Jules' bedroom, banging very loudly and incessantly on the wood until she opened it, eyes barely open, wearing a huge t-shirt that came down to her knees. \"What the holy fuck is going on, Marty? It's 3 am!\" He met her gaze levelly and said very distinctly so she couldn't possibly misunderstand him: \"Dana is sat in the shower, crying her eyes out. Please, please can you...get her to bed. Please. I know she'll listen to you. And I'm...sorry...for waking you.\" He waved vaguely and left the rest up to her. They were best friends, he knew she would help Dana. Man, he was tired...and so cold, he should probably...change into some dry clothes or something. Marty plodded into his room, locked the door behind him and stared at the unmade bed unseeingly for a good 5 minutes before he got himself into gear and fumbled around, stripping off his wet clothes and drying himself half-heartedly before pulling on new sweatpants and a shirt and depositing himself into bed, barely tugging the duvet around him before he fell asleep, glad of the sweet oblivion. Dana woke up the morning after with a very sore head and absolutely no recollection of the events of the previous night. She stumbled into the bathroom and threw herself headlong into the toilet before vomiting copiously into the bowl. Oh dear god. She thought she might die. Clinging onto the rim she closed her eyes and willed her stomach to stop churning. What had she drank last night?! Oh god. She was gonna hurl again. After what seemed like the billionth attempt to empty her insides she managed to drag herself back to bed and fell into an uneasy sleep, full of as much tap water as she could gulp down in one sitting.[Chapter 5] After a few hours had passed by Dana finally woke up and managed to pull herself into a sitting position and lever the tumbler of water on her bedside table into her lap miserably. Oh man. This was why drinking was a bad idea. Why did she never remember this! She felt sick and hot, her mouth dry and her eyelids sticky with sleep and old makeup. She couldn't imagine what she looked like. As long as Holden didn't...oh my god...Holden! Last night! What happened? She remembered a kiss, but to quite honest she couldn't put a name to the face. The redhead allowed herself a small sip of water, praying for it to stay down. She hadn't...she hoped she hadn't done anything stupid. Something she might regret. She did remember being in the shower and being really upset. And then waking up alone in her own bed. That had to be a good sign...right? She willed herself to swallow down more water. What time was it? Was everyone up or was it only her that'd gotten crazy drunk? How embarrassing...She rubbed frustratedly at her aching temple and willed herself into next week. Away from alcohol and deep into her books. She didn't think it was possible to want to be back at college but right now she would give anything to be in her dorm room and not waiting for...yep, Jules to walk in. The blonde - it was still weird to think of her as one - was supporting a large glass of water and some pills. \"Dana! I didn't think you would EVER wake UP!\" \"Me either.\" Croaked the redhead, then pressed a hand to her mouth in shock, \"Oh my god. I sound like an 80 year old man!\" \"Think of it as sexy-gravelly not...gross gravell-look, what happened last night with you Dana?\" Dana stared at her friend, blue eyes dazed and uncomprehending. Jules sighed and dropped the pills onto her palm. \"Take these.\" Dana obeyed without question. \"How come you aren't like...dying.\" \"Marty.\" \"Huh?\" \"He made me get YOU out of the shower at 3 am and put you to bed.\" Dana groaned, hands over her face. \"I'm so sorry.\" She said after a moment, spreading her fingers and peering at Jules through the gaps, then lowering them onto her lap, \"I don't - remember what happened. Well, entirely...\" Her lip caught between her teeth and she grimaced at Jules, who so far hadn't said anything encouraging like she'd hoped. \"I was upset,\" she carried on quietly, \"I was...\" she tried to pinpoint certain moments in her cloudy memory of the night, \"Sat with you guys...someone kissed me, I think - I don't remember who - and I went and sat in the shower for some...reason...and then I woke up in my bed.\" Jules looked like she was having an internal debate, her lips pursed, brow furrowed in concentration. Dana finally snapped. \"Oh for pity's sake Jules just... tell me what I did!\" \"I don't know! Marty hammered on my door at 3 o'clock this morning saying I had to get you out of the shower. That you were upset or something. He looked pretty shaken like something had happened between you...\" Dana's mouth dropped open as the realisation dawned. \"Wait...are you saying I kissed MARTY?\" Jules threw up her hands. \"I dunno! He was pretty bummed out about something. And come to think of it, he does like you an awful lot.\" \"B-but it's Marty, I mean-.\" \"I know that Dana but he's still a guy. Maybe you gave him the wrong impression. Why else were you guys in the shower together?\" Dana gulped down some more water desperately, as though this might trigger the memories to magically come back to her. The kiss was worrying. Marty? Really? I mean, out of everyone he was the least likely candidate for her...affections. Wasn't he? Now that she thought about it, she did remember Marty being with her last night. Scrunching her eyes she could see his face, blurry but concerned and...wet? Oh yeah. The shower. So Marty had come to make sure she was ok - that made sense. She had been upset...she remembered a wine bottle, drinking it under the warm spray. She remembered being angry. Irrationally so. Poor Marty. He probably thought she was insane. And there was him trying to do the right thing. But she didn't remember kissing him. At least, not in the shower... \"Dana. Are you alright?\" The red haired girl opened her eyes reluctantly and frowned at her friend. \"Just trying to...remember. I think Marty came to check on me and I pushed him away. That must have been when he decided to wake you. I feel terrible, Jules, he must think I'm crazy.\" Jules put her hand on Dana's shoulder firmly. \"Dana, you were upset. And it's Marty we're talking about here. He's probably forgotten all about it.\" The blonde mimed smoking a spliff complete with some dramatic fluttering her eyelashes in mock ecstasy. Dana giggled weakly. \"I hope you're right.\" Jules grinned and stood. \"Ready to join the living?\" Dana nodded sheepishly and slowly heaved herself out of bed, cringing at the mess of wet clothes under her bare feet as she tottered to her closet for a clean towel and found, to her embarrassment, that she used them to clean up her own vomit which was both resourceful and...disgusting. She looked up but Jules had left. She couldn't walk out there looking like death warmed up. Shame she didn't have a choice. Checking her pyjama pants and t for any unfortunate stains she was making some sort of attempt to order her hair and wishing that she had brushed her teeth when there was a knock on the door. Feeling her stomach somersault she had a brief moment of panic when Marty said on the other side. \"Dana...open up.\" Then she felt white-hot with shock and froze, a million and one replies coming to mind but nothing seemed appropriate for something she didn't entirely remember happening. There was a deadly silence. The red head heard the man shuffle around, sigh. Call her name tentatively again. This wasn't fair, she had to talk to him. She breathed in and out slowly and padded to the door, opening it even as her heart was thundering. The boy looked dishevelled and tired, face pale and eyes bloodshot but clear. No pot this morning then. When his eyes met Dana's he smiled half-heartedly. \"Hey...\" Dana began, trailing off when she couldn't find the right words, \"About last night...I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to...y'know...I was upset about...\" Her words dried up but her eyes pleaded with him, huge blue and slightly swollen from crying. Marty was immediately filled with remorse and any anger he felt towards her began to fade. \"Dana, it's ok...\" He had an urge to hug her but fought it with a customary arm pat, \"It's all...in the past.\" He wiggled his fingers to represent the dissipation of the event and grinned, trying to cheer her up. Dana felt relief at his words even though she didn't want to. Then her mouth decided to carry on of its own free will, as she clutched his shirt sleeve determinedly. \"It's not that I don't like you Marty,\" the blonde blinked, and put out a hand to interrupt but she carried on, \"It's just...I'm dealing with a lot of stuff right now. I-I'm not ready to jump into anything. Well, not yet anyway.\" She smiled lopsidedly and Marty just stared at her, not quite sure what he'd just witnessed. He let out a surprised bark of laughter and shook her elbow to reassure her. \"That's...absolutely...fine?\" Smile like you mean it. \"Thanks Marty.\" She swayed on the spot looking so relieved she was almost catatonic. Damn her expressive eyes. She almost looked like she wanted to...no, that wasn't possible. Marty stood, hand on her arm, feeling the feverish warmth of her skin through her t-shirt, feeling oddly like they were on the brink of something. Like something was going to happen. Then Dana appeared to re-focus, her hand dropping from his shirt to tuck her hair behind her ear as she looked at the ground and back up to his face. He pulled his own hand back and opened his mouth to depart but she spoke instead, worrying at her lip in a very...distracting way. Wait. What was wrong with him?! \"Um...I'm really sorry I bother you like this but uh...do you have a towel I could borrow, I uh...I don't have one that's uh...clean.\" She flushed scarlet. It took him a moment to process the request and he nodded one too many times. \"Of course,\" he swept his arm towards his room, \"After you my lady.\"[Chapter 6] After an awkward visit to Marty's room to borrow a towel, Dana flew to the bathroom to shower. Again. She hurriedly washed herself, feeling much better when she could put on some clean clothes and join the others without appearing like a total train wreck. She rinsed her own towels as best she could in the bathroom then gave them a spray and hung them out of her window to dry. Only then did she take a deep breath and wander out to the kitchen and fix herself a large glass of water. Holden was sat at the small table, nursing a black coffee. He smiled and nodded at her. \"Dana. Glad you're feeling better.\" She let out a laugh in a rush. \"Thanks. How are you feeling?\" \"Good. Good.\" His eyes were warm and kind and Dana felt herself looking away to avoid his gaze. \"I'm really embarrassed,\" she confided softly, \"I can't remember half of what happened last night.\" She bit her lip. \"Apparently I was a mess. I'm sorry if you had to deal with...any of that.\" Holden didn't react. He felt guilty that she clearly didn't remember the almost-kiss, but he was too selfish to bring it up now. It would just embarrass both of them and she would probably think he was some sort of creep who took advantage of drunk girls. Nothing had happened. And he was cool with that. Damn she was still cute though. All sincere with her damp hair clutching a huge tumbler of water. He laughed at himself. Eventually he would stop hitting on girls who were emotionally unavailable. \"That's ok Dana. You seemed fine to me. I left you with Marty I think - and he was sleeping so I'm sure you didn't cause too many problems!\" Dana's cheeks lost all colour then suddenly bloomed bright red. She laughed nervously and scooped her hair behind her ear. \"That's good to know.\" Kurt's head appeared around the doorframe. \"Heads up guys, heading to the lake in 2 minutes. Nice of you to join us Dana.\" He winked conspiratorially and vanished with a shit eating grin on his handsome face. Dana rolled her eyes, sighed and poured her water into the sink, placing the empty glass on the side and heading to her room to grab her bikini and Marty's towel - which although being damp was at least cleaner than hers. She hoped he didn't mind, she'd already offered to wash it when they got back to the flat. Marty was having what he could only describe as an 'existential crisis.' Dana clearly didn't remember that she'd hit him - pretty damn hard he might add - across the face and for some reason thought that they'd had some sort of moment. That something had happened between them. And now he couldn't get the idea out of his head. The thought that Dana...liked him. Or at least hadn't dismissed him completely because of his...stoner ways. He knew he smoked too much but after his brother had left home and his father had started sleeping around (yes he knew, he wasn't an idiot) he'd just kind of felt a need to escape and smoking just...lessened the load. Helped him forget his troubles, even for a brief time. Everyone had their own ways of dealing. This was his. His parents' marriage was breaking down and he felt guilty because he just wanted it to end. Marty dug in his pocket for a normal cigarette, some way behind the others on the forest track to the lake and thought about his options as he smoked. Dana was amazing, he'd always known that - with her stupidly blue eyes and her cute smile and her really cool drawings he saw her doodle in lectures when she thought no one was looking. He remembered seeing her for the first time since grade school, her hair a newly-coloured shade of red and Jules reintroducing them, Dana laughing and saying she actually couldn't remember the last time they saw each other. He'd thought about it for a second - a second - then realised she would never go for him and he wouldn't have a chance even in the deepest and darkest circles of hell. Marty took a last drag, flicked his ash to the side and squished the butt into the pine needles of the forest floor. But now...what...had happened? Dana thought they'd made out or something, instead of her making out with Holden like Jules and Kurt had planned...like what the hell! How had he gotten himself into this situation? How did he get himself further into it...oh god the innuendoes. He groaned and rubbed at his tired eyes. He wasn't ready for this but he probably wouldn't have another chance. Ever. \"Marty!\" Kurt thundered over to him, so loud Marty thought the fish might be able to hear him coming on the other side of the lake. Possibly the entire animal population had been woken from their slumber. \"You slowpoke! What the hell are you doing back here? We thought you'd gotten lost man!\" He bodily picked the smaller man up and ran along the path until the lake came into view and Marty began to struggle feebly and make half-assed noises of protest. \"Kurt you unfeeling interrupter of my inner peace!\" \"Suck it blondie.\" Kurt deposited his friend onto the rickety wooden pier and with a whoop launched himself in after his girlfriend who screamed and back paddled away, setting Holden and Dana off into a fit of giggling. Marty shuffled to the edge of the dock and slung his legs over the edge, allowing his feet to dangle in the cool water as he grumbled to himself and began to prepare a joint, deciding the best way out of this was to escape on a reefer fuelled train to bliss. He was half way through his first joint when Dana surfaced to his right like some sort of otherworldly mermaid and he leaned back in delayed shock, the red head laughing at him. \"Come on Marty, you're missing all the fun. You know Kurt'll just drag you in eventually...\" \"She's right!\" Came Kurt's disembodied affirmation. Marty met Dana's blue eyed gaze with his own glassy stare and a look of acute disappointment flashed across her face before she appeared to force it down and plaster a smile there instead. \"It's better to come in of your own free will than be thrown in.\" Marty felt his brow furrow as he searched for something - anything - to say to her. After a few minutes she shook her head and turned to swim back to the others. He took a deep lungful of the pot and thought about how beautiful she was for a moment before letting the joint drop into the water, pulling off his shirt and t and tumbling into the water with an ungraceful flail of limbs, bitching and whining all the way. The water was motherfucking freezing. \"It's like the 10th circle of hell in here.\" He stated, causing Jules to splash him playfully. \"Don't be such a pussy Mikalski.\" Said Kurt affectionately then Jules said suddenly. \"I propose a game.\" \"What kind of game, Jules.\" \"Dare-tag.\" There was a communal groan and Dana shook her head despairingly. \"Jules, we're in a lake, what exactly are we gonna dare people to do? Swim?\" \"She's got a point.\" Agreed Holden. Marty was fervently against this too. If anyone knew about him and Dana it was Jules and there was no way he was gonna be dared into kissing her. He was gonna do that in his own damn time and preferably with mutual desire on both sides. \"Fine! Be boring!\" The blonde pouted, \"Can we at least play normal tag?\" Kurt launched himself at Holden before anyone could agree and the friends engaged in a raucous game until it was generally decided they should go back to the cabin and finish off the alcohol. So they didn't have to take it home - of course.[Chapter 7] The last thing Dana wanted to do was drink, that was for sure. The thought of wine made her want to vomit so she settled on beer on tap from the keg and sipped gracefully watching Kurt try and mime his way through charades. They'd established that it was 'two words' and that it was a film. His large hands were trying to describe the first word with an action that looked suspiciously like he was jacking off and everyone was in hysterics as Jules and Marty rattled off words like 'ejaculation' and 'wiener' and 'love rub' which was causing Kurt to simultaneously get frustrated and amused at the same time. \"You're all losers.\" He growled exasperatedly, putting his face in his hands and shaking his head. Jules shouted out 'no talking!' and Dana interjected with 'you need to just be more specific.' Kurt rolled his eyes. And held up two fingers. \"Second word!\" They all chorused. And he put his hands together as if in prayer, apparently trying to look as pious as possible while Marty and the others were doubled over with laughter. \"Waitwait- wait-,\" He stuttered out, \"Prayer. Praying. Jerkoff Christian? Handjob Religion. Wiener Ch-church?\" Kurt's calm facade shattered and he began to shake with mirth. \"Wiener church! I give up!\" \"Penis worship?\" Piped up Jules with mock-innocence, and they all fell about laughing again. Kurt stumbled over to engage his girlfriend in a passionate kiss and she pushed him away giggling after a few minutes. \"Is there no other way of explaining it?\" Asked Dana and Kurt returned to his spot, a rare moment of expectant silence fell over the group as he thought about it. Dana got up to pour herself a third pint of beer. \"Okay okay, I gottit.\" Said the jock and held up one finger. \"First word!\" He approached the table and picked up a shot glass, holding it up for them all to see. Then he mimed shooting firing a gun. Dana jumped up. \"Oh my god! I've got it! Shotgun Preacher!\" Marty, Jules and Holden whooped loudly while Kurt pulled her into a one-armed hug with a: \"well done Dana!\" Kurt proceeded to climb on top of Jules to her distress (and everyone else's amusement) then placate her with kisses causing Marty and Dana to shout 'get a room!' \"Go get a different room, this one is taken!\" Bantered Kurt, but he stopped and pulled Jules onto his lap, poking her in the ribs to make her giggle. \"Dana, you're up!\" The red head necked the entirety of her pint to a miniature round of applause, then took to the 'stage.' \"Ok.\" \"Sssshhhhhhh!\" She flapped her hands, laughing to herself and tucking her hair behind her ears as she considered what her charade was going to be. She caught her lip between her teeth, unaware of its effect on two of their party, her mind swinging through the tipsy beer haze as it searched for a candidate. She opened her mouth to blurt something out but was silenced by more vehement sssshing and was forced instead to jump up and down excitedly. She held up her fingers. \"Three words!\" Came the chorus. Marty pitched forward onto his feet and meandered towards the keg, dutifully yet unsuccessfully pawing at Jules' beaker mid-air when she lobbed it at him, hollering for a refill. Dana stopped what she was doing and started towards him unsteadily: \"Do you mind-.\" \"Waaaay ahead of you sister.\" Grinned the blonde, winking playfully at her and whisking the cup out from under her nose. Dana felt her cheeks flush for no apparent reason and hurriedly continued the game. One finger. \"First word!\" Dana fished a map off the coffee table and opened it up, pretending to study it - turning it around and frowning and looking mock-confused to a flurry of words. \"Map!\" \"Travelling!\" \"Orienteering!\" \"Confused!\" \"Looking for Alaska?\" Dana laughed, almost falling over her own feet. She held up her hand again. \"Second word!\" She put a hand to her ear, dropping the map. \"Sounds like!\" She thought for a moment. Then steepled her hands above her head and hunched over, scuttling around the room. \"Shark! Swimming! Jaws!\" She shook her head, pointedly standing with her hands steepled, then gesturing for more words. \"Shark fin?\" Dana compressed the air. \"Sounds...like fin.\" Said Holden, smiling in somewhat blatant admiration, his words slightly out of sync with drink. Dana responded with an enthusiastic thumbs up. There was a raucous cheer and she returned to the front. They all stared at her expectantly. Marty was sprawled over the keg to her left. Kurt was now partially sat on Jules' lap, her arms around his waist. Holden was sporting an expression somewhere between euphoric and exhausted, his flagon resting precariously on he edge of his thigh. Dana made an 'ok' sign, then swayed towards Marty, who smiled dreamily at her and then almost hurt himself trying to give her his drink - rather than hers, which was perched next to him on top of the keg. She shook with silent laughter, ruffling his hair clumsily as she flopped over him, grasping for her tankard. Missing several times, Dana snatched determinedly at the handle, which wasn't going well because Marty was trying to help while in a fit of giggles. \"Dana!\" She'd finally wrapped her fingers around the handle but it was heavier than she anticipated and within a split-second Marty was coated with an extra layer of beer. This only made him laugh more, their faces inches apart as liquid dropped from his bangs and his nose, his hand on her shoulder as he tried to support himself. Dana cracked up, her legs giving way and they crumbled to the ground, unable to compose themselves. \"Wh-what are you doing?\" Choked out Marty, scrubbing beer out of his eyes with the back of his hand. Dana attempted to form some kind of explanation, pointing to her and Marty, then to the keg but burst out laughing again when she met his gaze. \"Guys stop making out and get on with it!\" Shouted Jules. \"Yeah stop wasting my beer!\" Agreed Kurt. Holden, who had been slowly nodding off, jerked awake, spilling his drink down the crotch of his jeans and jumping up with a curse. \"Holden, dude, you ok?\" Kurt seemed genuinely concerned until his eyes alighted on the wet patch and he laughed uproariously. Holden pinched the bridge of his nose and grabbed onto the arm of the sofa for support looking practically green. Jules appearing to be the only one that could function under the influence, wriggled out of the chair and took the football player by the elbow, ushering him gently out of the room. Over by the keg, Marty and Dana were talking drunken-animatedly about something, still sat on the floor knee-to-knee. Whatever it was it included a lot of face-touching and gesturing and hysterics. Marty dug in his pocket and lit a bent-looking joint and the pair calmed down a little, engulfed by a cloud of smoke. Kurt stumbled over and stole a drag before going to make sure Jules was ok, leaving Dana and Marty alone in the common area.[Chapter 8] Marty and Dana were sat on the floor for a while before they realised no one was coming back. Dana felt pleasantly dizzy, although the pot was fucking with her insides a bit and the dizziness was crossing over into nausea every few minutes. Marty had fallen asleep - as he had a tendency to do in random places - so she dragged herself onto her feet and stumbled out onto the porch, perching on the edge and breathing deep, refreshing cool night air. In front of her the forest loomed, crowding and intimidating like a bunch of bullies on the school playing field. The air felt close and heavy like rain was coming, she could smell pine and undergrowth, fresh and distinct as it washed over her. Sure enough, the moonlight gradually disappeared and droplets began to pepper her face. She closed her eyes, the spray clearing her mind from fumes and toxins and allowing her to breathe properly and deeply. She felt better, less sick and more awake. The rain picked up the pace and suddenly Marty was next to her. He plonked himself down on the ledge and they sat for a while in silence, just enjoying the coolness of the night and the relaxing sound of the rain on the forest around them. Marty made a noise - a sigh mixed with a groan - and she turned to look at him, a smile teasing at her lips. He looked up from where his head was between his knees and grinned lopsidedly at her. Then his face fell and he reached out hesitantly to brush her soaked hair back from her cheek and she frowned, wondering why he seemed so sad all of a sudden. And why the tender gesture. Her heart stuttered a little as she stared into his weird blue-green eyes and a keen sense of terror...and anticipation lanced through her. \"Dana...\" He said softly, his voice strained after smoking, drinking and rain. But he couldn't think of a good way to say anything. Anything meaningful at least. He let his hand slide down the side of her jaw, despondently returning it to his thigh as he turned his head away in shame. He couldn't believe he'd just...not even...done anything. \"Marty I -I just...\" She teetered gently forward, bumping their heads together - her forehead to the left of his temple and following this with a messy drag of her mouth across his ear/jaw divide. Actions delayed by beer and weed, Marty slowly turned his head and their mouths met awkward but sweet. Dana pressed into him, grasping at his hair which was slippery with rain, breathing in his scent, savouring the way his lips slid against hers as her heart thumped away at double the speed and his hands moved up to cradle her face and everything else disappeared. She was kissing Marty and it wasn't weird. Or uncomfortable. Or unnatural. Or any of the things she thought it might have been a little over 24 hours ago. He was a fantastic kisser - something she wouldn't have pegged him as - he wasn't holding back, wasn't somewhere else, he was there, in the moment, mouth caressing, tongue teasing, teeth tugging gently on her bottom lip, making her smile and him kiss her nose, mirroring her expression as he cupped her face and ran his thumbs across her cheeks reverently. He couldn't believe it. She had kissed him. Of her own - mostly - free will - based on a warped perception - but she'd kissed him. Not Holden. Not (hopefully) out of pity. They grinned at each other nonsensically for a moment before Dana let out an involuntary shiver and Marty put his arm around her shoulders. \"We should probably go inside, it's uh...it's a bit wet out here.\" Dana giggled and rested her head briefly on his as they hobbled to the door - impeded by sodden clothes and a slippery porch.[Chapter 9] Marty was stupidly happy. He felt dizzy and elated. Soaked as well from the rain. They almost fell over the threshold with their linked fingers and Dana was back to giggling again and raising her free hand to her lips whispering 'sssshhh' as they squeezed into the living room and sat in a sodden mess before Marty decided they should probably change clothes. He desperately wanted to stay in this little bubble of giddiness but realistically, pneumonia was unlikely to help things along. He dragged the girl - the beautiful, kind, amazing girl - to her feet and let her kiss him again, wanting save the moment. \"We should probably rid ourselves of these...cumbersome garments.\" He smiled lopsidedly, acknowledging the innuendo. \"I don't wanna get sick when it's not even,\" he sniffed, \"July.\" Dana laughed, shaking her head. \"Marty it's August 5.\" She took both of his hands playfully, then changed her mind, running her fingers through his hair which spurred him to push hers back behind her ear. There were those dimples - the damn things were gonna kill him someday. \"You're really wet too.\" He laughed and rubbed a thumb across her cheek. They meandered back to their rooms and reluctantly parted ways with a promise to meet in five minutes. Marty, however, found himself some minutes later sat in consternation on his bed, still in his wet clothes, worrying - now that the fog was fading - whether this whole 'thing' with him and Dana was built on a lie and whether he'd somehow coerced her into following a thread that wasn't there. He needed to tell her what actually happened the other night in the shower, kisses be damned. His thoughts were interrupted by a nervous knock at the door and he was barely able to drag a smile onto his face before Dana was shuffling in - dressed in a t and baggy pants - looking a little bit sheepish. A bolt of bittersweet irony lanced through him. Maybe she had used this time to think too. She sat next to him on the bed and put a hand on his arm, only to recoil in disgust. \"Ew Marty you're still drenched. Don't you have any dry clothes?\" He smiled at her half heartedly and shivered as he realised how cold he was. \"Here - let me help you.\" \"N-no...no Dana...urgh. Stop-.\" He was too tired to resist and soon she had peeled the offending cardigan and tshirt off him and thrown them swiftly into a corner. She then rooted under his bed for a shirt. He batted her off unsuccessfully. \"I can dress myself! I am not some man-doll.\" With a joint effort he was encased in a warm, dry jumper and he stood, starting to undo his belt before realising she was watching him. He glanced at her, suddenly feeling self conscious. He was tempted to make a jokey come on to break the silence but somehow nothing seemed appropriate. She was biting her lip, rosy cheeked with embarrassment and deliberately staring at the wall. He forced himself to strip out of his corduroy jeans and awkwardly pull on his sweats before sitting back down next to her. He took a breath. Now was the time. He had to tell her, it had to be done. He put a hand ontop of her clenched ones and she looked up to meet his gaze. \"Marty-.\" \"Dana-.\" They laughed. \"You go-.\" \"No it's ok-.\" \"Dana,\" he couldn't help but smile sardonically in self-depreciation, \"The other night, when you were in the shower, with the wine and the crying...\" He trailed off weakly as she tried to kill him with her gaze, \"Uh, yeah..you know what I mean. The next morning, you -,\" He was finding this harder than he'd first anticipated, and his hands pawed the air as he articulated his words, \"Seemed to be of the persuasion that we...shared uh, a 'moment'\". He paused and looked at her, worried but desperate for her to know the truth as he pulled out the real story word by word. Breathe, Mikalski. Soon it may not matter anymore. You were never good enough for her, it was all a pipe dream. Oh how he wished it was one, but some selfish part of him was glad he had been allowed to kiss her at least once. Dana's pale bedraggled face was wrought with confusion. \"Marty, what do you mean?\" \"Y-you slapped me.\" \"I what?!\" \"You were...angry or something that I had disturbed your weird...special shower time and I -\", He splayed his fingers just as he felt his one chance slipping through them, \"Just - you said to me \"You leave me alone Martin Mikalski, I don't want you in my life.\" So I got Jules and then..well I guess you know the rest.\" He shrugged and finally laid his hands to rest on his thighs. He could wax lyrical about how much he liked and respected her, but it was her turn to speak. If she wanted to speak to him. He couldn't look at her right this second. But he would do it in a minute. The seconds ticked by and Marty risked a peak out of the corner of his eye. She was worrying at her thumb, cheeks a delicate pink, tendrils of drying auburn curls framing her face. Her eyes were distant, unseeing and he didn't know what to say, or whether he should say anything. \"I'm not sure which is worse!\" She exclaimed finally, a bemused smile curling her lips as blue connected with green. \"I - I feel like I should...apologise-,\" The blonde put his hands up in protest, eyes wide. \"No-no Dana, you were totally within your rights to tell me to leave. I-I was totally invading your personal space, which I accept full-. \"Marty. Fucking just, shut up for a second. I slapped you. I was upset, I-\", She brushed offending static locks from her forehead, \"Was angry. Not at you - well not completely - and I took it out on you. And I shouldn't have, I was outta line.\" \"Dana...\" Marty was stuck for words, he could feel hers crowding inside his mind making him feel sick as the possibility of repeating the last hour faded. She looked awkward, embarrassed but she was there still and maybe-just maybe. Marty gathered his tattered wits about him and readied himself for one last stand. How to- What should he- How could he- Now what did he- Fuck it. He climbed onto his knees on the bed beside her and took her hands firmly. \"Dana, look at me.\" She did, warily. \"Look, I know this may sound fucked up but I don't care that you-slapped me-which really fucking hurt by the way. I care that this,\" he shook her hands demonstratively, \"Is built on a lie. And I don't wanna start anything with someone that...didn't even want me in the first place.\" The redhead looked as though he'd returned the favour, mouth ajar in surprise. \"You...like me?\" He pulled a face somewhere between a grimace and a smile. \"That's the way of the world!\" He declared with false enthusiasm. \"But I slapped you across the face.\" \"Yeah, I know, I think you'll find I was there also.\" \"Me.\" \"Oh for the love of everything sacred and...consecrated, woman, have you seen yourself? You're...you're beautiful! Your hair is just-.\" He gesticulated towards her as though he was reciting a poem and she was his muse. \"Your eyes are amazing, your smile. Your dimples!\" He was full of fire, feeling like making out with her and then wringing her beautiful neck. \"You're kind...and and resourceful, and smart and a far better person than I'll ever be. I've seen those drawings you...doodle in lectures when you think noones watching you...well they're amazing! And so are you Dana Polk.\" There was a pause in which Dana felt like she'd been dumped over a waterfall and Marty like he'd sprinted the last 100 metres of a race. \"I thought you were asleep!\" \"No! Well, at least, not all the time...I was really tired ok?\" He smiled as he realised how ridiculous he sounded and soon Dana was laughing and they both shook silently before Marty noticed Dana wasn't running for the hills. \"You're still here. Even after my gallant...speech.\" She smiled, dimples aplenty. \"Well observed.\" She took his hand and he felt a jolt of hope run through him. She scraped her hair back absently and bit her lip and he felt his heart swell like a balloon. Was this actually happening? Or was he going to wake up in the middle of the park...wearing only boxers, with a raccoon scratching at his-. He shook the memory off and focussed on the woman in front of him. \"Marty I'm not ready for...everything, yet.\" She held up to stop him from interrupting with anymore gallantry. \"But I mean, I would like to,\" she took a breath and stuttered out, \"Maybe go on a...date sometime.\" She barely whispered the word date, but Marty heard it and couldn't stop an ecstatic shit-eating grin spreading across his face. \"I'm sorry, what was that? I didn't hear you, I mean I may just be going deaf in my old age but I think I heard you say that you wanted to date me? I'm not sure my delicate nature can handle such sordidness-.\" Dana did hit him - with a pillow this time - coupled with. \"Marty you asshole.\" He laughed and flapped helplessly at the pillow until he got the strength to snatch it away and return the favour with vigour. Dana screeched and tried to grab it back before Marty pinned her down and bombarded her with soft fluffy blows until she begged him to stop through her giggling. \"You're such an-.\" \"Asshole. Yeah you said, but you also said you wanted to go on a\", and he whispered \"date.\" Dana smiled mischievously and bit her lip. \"Maybe.\" Suddenly it occurred to Marty that he was straddling her, like literally on top of the girl he was into and she was looking at him at he was something tasty she wanted to try. His lower regions responded to this and he groaned, covering his face with his hands and wishing he was not a guy right now. He took his hands away, face bright red and looked at her, feeling ridiculous. \"This is not fair. Not fair at all.\" Dana laughed at him and wriggled backwards into a sitting position between his legs, a movement which made his breath hitch. \"Patience, Marty. I'm not a complete...you know but I'm not ready yet. I will be, and if you wanna stick around I will be. But maybe...not for a little while. I have some issues I need to deal with first.\" \"Yeah I'm totally fine with all of that. So totally fine. The little guy - I mean, the big guy, I mean the guy downstairs he just like, gets a little over excited sometimes but you know, it's nothing I can't handle, in fact-.\" Dana kissed her way softy down his jawline during this revelation, interrupting it with a teasing attack on his bottom lip - which he returned with gusto. She broke off the kiss with a breathless laugh and threw her arms around him in a hug. He held her close, breathing in her scent and thanking whatever gods there were out there that this wasn't some sort of dream. It's not, right? ","Summary":" Dana had known Marty for a long time now.

Humanity had created many new weapons and devised and redivised many strategies and plans to drive the bugs back. None of this seemed to be helping Humanity win the war. The simple truth Humanity had to face was the bugs had the numbers. The Arachnids could and did just keep laying eggs and hatching warriors who were ready to fight immediately. Humans even when the Strategic Integrated Coalition Of Nations (SICON) officially lowered the enlistment age to 16 and dropped training time to six months, still needed that 16 and a half years to get a warrior ready and out into the field against the bugs. Logistics were also a major problem for SICON. It took more then a ton a week in supplies to keep one human warrior in the field on an alien world. The Arachnids did not have this problem. They could adapt themselves to any environment and come out ready to fight, living on whatever was own hand even each other. Arachnids did not need factory workers and administrative and support staffs. They had some subspecies for this but all of them could be pressed into the fight if needed or be cannibalized to keep the warriors fighting. This was a war of genocide. There could be no surrender, no peace terms worked out, no diplomancy. If Humanity was to win this war then not only were even better weapons needed but better strategies and tactics to use them with were needed. This new strategy would need to be one of total war using and reusing everything and everyone available. One of the most basic problems was bug infested planets could not be bombed out of existence. First, habitual planets are rare. Humanity would need them during the war to stage the next attack and after the war to rebuild and expand. Second this would not guarantee the bug infestation was removed. If any Arachnids survived then they could adapt to the devastation, radiation and even complete barrenness and launch new attacks against Humanity. What the Federation needed was greater and more accurate Intelligence on the Arachnids. What they needed were troopers who could go in with limited supplies and no hope of relief to provide Military Intelligence on whether a planet had been infested or not. On what level of infestation there was and what kinds of subspecies were present. Robotic and Drone vehicles could not do the job. They did not have the intuitive senses and responses Federation needed suicide squads for these and hundreds of other similar missions, but SICON knew that they did not have any troopers to spare for these suicide missions. The latest military leader charged with solving this and many other problems was Sky Marshall Bennet. She pondered on this dilemma for many days and nights. One day during a few brief hours of relaxation, she was partaking of her only vice and she was watching an old pre-Federation vid. This one told the story of a one of the old wars between nations of Earth about a unit of soldiers composed entirely of condemned soldier criminals. These soldiers were given a choice between a certain death sentence or going on a suicide mission. These misfits all choose to go and they scored a great victory for their side even though most of them died on the mission. She quickly realized this was a perfect answer for the new strategy. As with any war throughout history the bug war was producing many criminals along with a great many heroes. So now the Federation could get some use out of these malcontents and have them serve a better purpose then just dying for their crimes. Sky Marshall Bennet's plan had no problem being quickly approved and put into immediate action. Condemned military prisoners were put into units and sent on missions to risky and dangerous for anyone else to attempt with a reasonable chance of coming back in one piece. In order to get them to go they were promised many things. They were told their records would be cleared and their families would never be told of their disgrace. They would be granted full citizenship in the Federation if they died on mission. If they performed well and survived then they would be allowed to rejoin regular military units with new identities and clean records. What they were also told was depending on what they had been convicted of they would have to survive a certain number of missions based on their crimes. The lowest possible number was three, the highest never more then ten. They were not told that the actual odds of surviving one mission were calculated at worse then winning the lottery and sinking a whole in one on the same day. It did not take long for the members of these new criminal squads to realize just how bad they had it. Since their only other choice was a death sentence, most carried on hoping to get that win against the odds. They were not given names for their squads, only numbered designations. Since they were all dead troopers anyway the members of these criminal squads began to call themselves a name of their own creation, the Walking Dead. After five years and uncountable successful missions and even more failed ones, only one trooper has ever fully completed their mission count and was eligible to be released and returned to their unit. Reluctantly SICON returned him to a Regular Mobile Infantry platoon. However SICON does not know how one of the Walking Dead can return to life. But he does. Former Captain Daniel Ferguson has returned from the Walking Dead with not only a new life but a new mission. He will not only bring himself back to life but he will bring the entire Federation and back to the original goals the founding mothers and fathers set for it.[Chapter 2] Chapter One A Meeting of Unalike Minds 3rd Lieutenant Constance Harper gave a scolding look to the private who had jostled her. Fresh from basic, the terrified private could not stand up to stolid veteran's stare. He moved away with his head down and attempting to mumble a weak apology. Major Mumba would have been so proud of her. She should not blame him. The shuttle taking them from the troop transport Olympus to their new berth on the Anthony Wayne a combat cruiser was packed to bursting. The Olympus had been only half full so there was a lot of empty space. Most saw that as a good thing but Lt. Harper knew it was not. Like some history teacher on fast forward, Constance's mind replayed the past leading up to her standing in this shuttle. The war against the Arachnids had been going on for ten years now. The Arachnids were set for total domination of the galaxy leaving no other species to oppose them. Humanity had so far been in a draw. Some wins and some losses. The Arachnids bred much faster then Humans. To try and counter this the Strategically Integrated Coalition of Nations (SICON) went so far as to reduce the enlistment age to 16. Earth was still having trouble finding bodies to become troopers. The amount of space on the Olympus testified to that. Looking around the shuttle's bay, she took in those she would soon be leading in to combat. Most were kids just out of basic like the private she just given the stare to. Since lowering the enlistment age to 16, calling them kids was not an understatement. Some small groups of veterans were scattered around, trying to avoid the newbies. Half of them were returning from convalescence. She watched them still trying to adjust to the cybernetic limbs and other artificial parts which allowed them to get back into the war. She knew the Federation needed every trooper it could get but she still thought losing a limb you should be allowed to retire with citizenship. Almost everyone else in the bay was her classmates from Officer Candidate School. New officers going out on their final performance test. SICON got one thing right only those who had been in combat should lead others into combat. In the Mobile Infantry all officers started out enlisted and earned their chance at commission in the heat of battle. Then they had to prove it in an extremely demanding Officer's Training Course. Since the Arachnids liked to target officers there was not a shortage of new ones these days. Thinking over the last couple of months of officer training she wondered if she was ready for the big decisions she would have to make. The need to get bars in the field meant some of the extras had been trimmed from the class and they had had to finish up aboard the Olympus . \"You noticed him too\" Danny broke into her thoughts. Lt. Harper's mind raced through what Danny had said and suddenly realized she had been staring at one particular veteran for over a minute. She knew what 3rd Lieutenant Daniel Mallory must be thinking. He liked Constance and she liked him too in the same way. But the demands of officer school and an uncertain future meant any relationship other then brother officers would have to wait. That did not mean he liked her looking at other men. To get Danny back on the right thinking track she said matter of factly, \"He does stand out, even in this group. What have you heard about him?\" Danny went into his intelligence mode and recited what he had heard just like he was giving a briefing, \"Very little, scuttlebutt has all kinds of postings but nothing anyone will swear to, more friend of a friend said kinda stuff. He's not out of basic but no one knows what his last unit was. I got a look at his file and his past history is completely blank.\" Still staring at the private, Lt. Harper knew that could not be right. The private stood just at six feet and looked to be made entirely of lean muscle titanium bones. While that didn't make him stand out in this group two things did, one were his scars. Grizzled veteran did not begin to cover him. The private still had all his limbs, fingers and she guessed toes but his exposed skin looked like he had been through a wood chipper. His buzz cut brown hair was more a patch work due to the scar tissue and his skin tone could not be determined. The other thing that made him stand out was the look in his hazel eyes. A lot of veterans had the thousand-yard stare but that was not quite the private's look. It was more like a thousand degree stare. Although he was moving a muscle, his eyes seemed to take in everything, evaluating it and categorizing the threat level. If anything struck him as not right he would just look at it and incinerate it. Lt. Harper turned her look back to Danny and answered with \"What do you mean blank? He must have something in there.\" She glanced back at the private and noticed something else which made him stand out. He didn't have a kit bag. Any personal possessions could only be in his pockets. Of course he did have an equipment belt complete with a holstered pistol and combat knife. \"Wait a minute; troopers get their weapons on their ship when assigned to a platoon. Why is he armed?\" Danny ignored her question and continued his briefing, \"Oh there is the basic information in the file but there isn't any history. It states he completed basic ten years ago and then nothing until orders assigning him to the Anthony Wayne . Still didn't stop him from training all the newbies and some of the returning wounded veterans like he was a drill instructor.\" Lt. Harper had heard about that. Usually the enlisted performed some details and routine drills will aboard a troop ship. Just to keep them occupied and to keep them at a razor edge. From what she heard this private had cleared one of the cargo bays out and turned it into a training field. Danny continued, \"I managed to sneak in and see a little of it. He had them doing some very advanced and completely unorthodox maneuvers.\" Constance would have liked to have seen it but she and the rest of her officer class had been in their own advanced training with Major Mumba. Danny was always getting less extra essays since he was a genius at coming up with the answers the Major was looking for. Turning to look at Constance he said, \"Did you get a chance to check out any of his training?\" \"No. Unlike you I was to busy doing essays and bench presses for Major Mumba.\" Constance didn't know if the private had heard them talking about him or just knew it. She suddenly found his gaze on her. Looking into his eyes scared her. She had faced Arachnid warriors at one meter and not been worried. His gaze actually gave her an involuntary chill up her spine. Yet there was something familiar about it too. After a couple of seconds Constance turned to Danny, \"Did his file say anything useful?\" The blandest voice she had ever heard suddenly interrupted her and said, \"Sir, this private requests permission to speak, Sir.\" Lt. Harper snapped her head back around to find the private standing at attention and sharply saluting in front of her. Before she could think of how he had moved from where he had been standing to in front of her so fast, training took over. Lt. Harper saluted back saying, \"Permission granted.\" \"Sir, this private is assigned to your platoon as a basic rifleman. This private will serve the Federation better as a squad leader or senior sergeant, Sir.\" This was not something covered in one of Major Mumba's classes or any of her previous experience. How did he even know which platoon he was assigned to? She did not even know which platoon would be her final test platoon. And since when did a private request to be given a command from an officer? Only demonstrated ability got you a command position. Lt. Harper knew she needed to get on top of this private immediately. She gathered herself, took a quick look at his nametag, it said Walker, and then forced herself to look him in the eye, \"Private Walker once we are in the field if you show some potential I will consider you for any available positions. Until then those who have proven themselves in combat will lead.\" His reply was proper and again completely flat, \"Sir, very good, prudent and by the book answer, Sir.\" Continuing without showing any disappointment or concern the private pulled a piece of paper from his pocket. \"Sir, if you would be so good, I request these replacements, who are also assigned to your final test platoon, is put in the same squad as this private. They have shown me to be very good troopers. Sir.\" Lt. Harper was at a complete loss at this. When did a private make squad rosters? How did he even know all these troopers were assigned to the same platoon? She really needed to take charge of this and find out where he got his information before it got anymore out of her control. She could see other troopers and officers starting to take notice. Snatching the paper from him, Lt. Harper tried a new tact, \"I will look over your list of friends and if all of you look like a team instead of a kindergarten field trip I will consider this.\" Steeling herself, Lt. Harper went on the offensive, \"Anything else you would like? Maybe you want to take my place and lead the platoon?\" The private only lowered his hand and said, \"Sir, thank you and I will see you soon. Sir.\" Then he saluted, turned and marched away. While Lt. Harper stared at the private and watched him return to his initial position, Danny spoke up, \"I did learn one thing from his file. His name, it is Private D. M. Walker.\" Now Lt. Harper was annoyed at Danny and said, \"I read that on his shirt Lt. Mallory.\" \"Yes but did his shirt tell you the D. M. stood for Dead Man?\" Constance whipped her head around and turned her stare to Danny. He looked into her eyes with a little smirk and raised his hands palms up defensively and said, That's right you're looking at Private Dead Man Walker. Who has no history and seems to know our job better than we do. I could not make this stuff up\" Constance turned back to look at Private Walker. She could not begin to know what to think of him. All she knew was the war just became something no amount of training had ever prepared anyone for. Private May Jong Lee kept her eye on Walker as he marched sharply away from the officer and back to his spot taking up his post again. She could feel something about this, but she was not sure what. She knew it could not be jealousy. Sure the lieutenant was pretty and stood with a confidence May knew she could never put that much confidence into her stance let alone her entire being. Walker had told her she was good. Told her after the training sessions he ran, he was going to request she be in his squad. She just could not grasp why he was ignoring her and the others he had selected on the trip over to their new ship. Twirling the small strands of hair she had she thought maybe if they had not cut it for training she would look better. People in her village always said her long black hair was her best feature. Maybe she was jealous of the lieutenant who could keep her light brown hair longer then May was allowed to. Maybe Walker preferred women with European ancestry over May's Chinese ancestry. \"What are you thinking May Jong Lee? If Walker had any interest in anything other then killing bugs he would have given you some indication. Right? Or given her some sign or tried to kiss her or even touch her.\" she scolded herself. May wished she knew men better. Her parents had never let her date though. Of course there were plenty of boys who had wanted a date from her in the Mobile Infantry. Some had hinted at it, while others had blatantly offered themselves to her. May's shyness and the values her parents had drilled into her kept from doing anything more than blushing and choking out a feeble \"No\". Besides her parents had been very clear, after her sister had died fighting the bugs she was the one who must enlist and become a citizen so the family could better themselves. Dating and marriage could wait and she must not do anything in the meantime to ruin herself for her future husband. May was willing to bet the Lieutenant Walker had been talking too had not waited for marriage. She was standing to close to the other Lieutenant. She was leaning into him too close when they talked. Of course they were both veterans and looked at least six or seven years older than May's 16 years. Private May Jong Lee was part of the new recruitment drive, signing up troopers younger and younger even though the Federation was winning the war. The Net said they were winning, just that all the bugs must be killed to make the galaxy safe for humanity. Seems the bugs were spreading out and trying to outbreed the Federation. Quite a few of the boys had tried using that line to get May to go out with them. Feeling a blush coming, Private Lee changed her thoughts back to what Walker had told her at the last training session. He had called a lot of troopers over and told all of them he knew they were the best on the ship and he would be proud to serve and fight with them. He would make certain all them fought together and he would see to it they lived to tell about it. Walker never said where he had learned all about killing bugs but anyone could see he knew more about it then any Sky Marshall or Drill Master. Sometimes he let it slip he knew about fighting other races like the Skinnies and the Forth. All the troopers kept trying to guess who or what Walker really was. May even put 20 credits into the pool the troopers had put together to guess his origins. She guessed Walker used to be in Military Intelligence but had lost whatever special mind power he had had and was sent to the Mobile Infantry. It would be just like Military Intelligence to do something cruel like that instead of just letting him retire with citizenship. Use people and then throw them away. The returning wounded veterans who took part in Walker's training did not take part in the pool. The few who talked to her about something other then sex all agreed they had never heard of him in any unit. They seemed to think he was from some super secret commando company. While that might be true it did not explain what he was doing here, now at the lowest rank, being sent into a regular ape company. May's train of thought got derailed when the warning klaxon went off. After three loud blares the pilot's voice announced, \"Docking in two minutes. All passengers secure for docking and prepare for transfer.\" May checked her kit bag was secure and stole a glance at Walker. He was looking right at her. She was surprised but then saw his hands. Walker flashed the hand signal for follow me. Private Lee flashed back the affirmative. Walker gave the affirmative and turned to get the attention of the rest of his handpicked troopers. All Private Lee could think about was she would follow him and he would do all he could for her. She just tried not to ask herself why he or she was doing it.[Chapter 3] Chapter Two A G. I. party in the barracks Deep in the Anthony Wayne Senior Sergeant Ty Driscoll sat on his bunk and looked over what was left of his handpicked squad and sighed. The last operation had been a total bust. Not only had they not gotten what they wanted from the little settlement but half his troopers were still down there as bug chow. \"Well the replacements were due in today. Maybe some of them would be the right sort to join his little band of merry troopers.\" He thought. Looking at the four troopers around him Ty knew he needed to break the bad news to them now before the replacements arrived. \"Listen up you lazy apes; we are going to have to curtail our special ops for a while.\" Lopez, of course answered first, \"Come on Sarge I gotta get some more credits to send home.\" Driscoll knew Lopez did not send the extra money they made to his home. He wasted it all here on the ship on things like the special food service. Lopez just did not like to give up the luxuries. Before he could say anything Carter answered for him, \"Lopez you gotta be smart. There aren't enough of us left to do an op. We need some more troopers, so we gotta check out these new apes coming in to see if they are the right material before we try anything else.\" Driscoll looked at Carter and nodded. He knew he had picked right when he brought Carter into the group. The boy was smart, saving the money they picked up instead of spending it. That fit in with Senior Sergeant Driscoll's big plan. Driscoll had saved enough of his share to pay off one of the admin clerks for a transfer back to Earth. Now he just needed to hang around long enough to make sure Carter picked the right replacement crew. Not anyone who would go regulation on them and report what they did to the new Lt. One slip up and they would come for him while he was vacationing on Earth instead of fighting for his life on another airless dirtball. It was not like what they did was against the law or any regulation. So many of the Settlers on these colony worlds, just like the one they were orbiting now, usually left in a hurry. They left in so much of a hurry they were not able to take any of their prize possessions with them. Things they dearly wanted returned to them. The answer to this problem was Driscoll and his special squad. First Driscoll had paid a trooper on a refugee ship to let the refugees know for the right price they could have the things they lost and wanted back picked up and sent to them. Most times they did not even need to go off mission to pick up what the refugees wanted. Most of it was photos or little reminders. Of course some things they wanted were very valuable and others just plain illegal. No questions, just product delivered and fee collected. It was a sweet deal where everyone came out ahead. Maybe sometimes Driscoll's troopers were not where they needed to be and other troopers had to do without their support, but hey those were the risks one took when you joined the Mobile Infantry. A sudden flash of memory interrupted his happy review. His mind brought back to him the only snag they had ever really had. Six months ago with a new guy. Wilson had been his name. He was just another new ape on his first mission. But the kid had joined the Mobile Infantry so he could get his citizenship and become a police detective. Wilson had been smart and observant enough to figure out something was not right with his new platoon. Wilson followed Driscoll's special troopers while they searched one settlement. He used his suit camera to record them taking things and then reported it to the lieutenant. Driscoll was not about to let some new punk ruin his plan to get out of the war. Driscoll saw the lieutenant coming and shot him dead. He and his special squad captured Wilson and then framed him for the killing. Ten veteran troopers saying a new kid panicked and shot the lieutenant while trying to flee, the kid did not have a chance. The court martial found him guilty of murder, desertion in the face of the enemy and treason. Wilson got a death sentence and the special squad went back to work without a hitch. The last mission went bust though. The squad had gone into a small city to recover guy's art collection. Trouble was the arachnids had not been has cleared as Intel had said they were. Of his ten troopers only half made it off the planet. They had also had to call an air strike in and blast the art to smithereens. Now he needed to get a new crew together and get back them back into the reclamation business. Then he could enjoy his retirement. Nothing but booze and babes and beaches for Driscoll. \"Hey Sarge the new fish are in the bay. The new Lt. is asking for you and she's a cutie.\" \"Thanks Wong, now Carter get your dumb butt down and meet up with the fleet guy to ship out the goods we did manage to collect, Lopez needs to send some money home. The rest of you apes help me greet our new friends and hopefully business partners.\" Leaving the Senior Sergeant's quarters Driscoll saw the new troopers lined up in the middle of the bay. Only twelve were there. The platoon needed twice that many to get up to fighting strength and quite a few more to be at full strength. The new lieutenant was not among them. She was looking over the platoon's weapon racks. Probably trying to get a feel for the platoon by their level of weapon's maintenance, maybe she knew her business. Better see her first and then straighten the newbies out who was really in charge. Snapping to attention next to the new lieutenant he saluted, \"Sir, Senior Sergeant Driscoll temporary commander of the Dog Pack, Sir.\" Well seems Wong was right about one thing, the new lieutenant was cute, pretty even. She looked like she was from Eastern Europe. Her light brown hair was cut short but he could see it was the same color as her eyes. She stood only a little shorter then Driscoll's 5' 11\" but she is definitely was better muscled Driscoll noticed. Probably from not being on constant alert and eating regularly, Driscoll was looking forward to that part of his retirement. Lt. Harper looked over Sergeant Driscoll and returned his salute, \"Very well Sergeant. I will take command of the Dog Pack right after I see Captain Daly. Have the platoon lined up and ready for the exchange of leadership ceremony when I return.\" Driscoll understood all the military necessity of pomp and circumstance and how he would get around it. Officers might give the orders but NCOs did all the work. This one would not be any more trouble the others. \"Sir, very good will there be anything else? Sir.\" \"Yes, I want to see you and the platoon records and logs when I return.\" \"Sir, very good, all will be ready, Sir.\" With that he saluted again. After she returned the salute Lt. Harper left the bay. As soon as she was gone Driscoll turned to the platoon, \"Alright you apes toes on the line, now.\" The entire platoon hustled up to join the new recruits. Once everyone was lined up, Driscoll turned and gave them the once over. The first thing he took in was the one odd one in the group. Standing six feet and a lean 190 pounds was not unusual, the many scars covering all his exposed skin was getting more common, the fact he was armed was definitely not normal but that was not what caught Driscoll's attention. You did not live long against the bugs if you did not trust your instincts. Something was telling him this guy would be trouble, big trouble. He needed to end whatever problem he would cause now on his terms before that 3rd Lieutenant returned. \"Every one of you listen up. The Sky Marshall has graciously sent us another platoon leader. I know all of you will give her your total support. She will give the orders and I will make sure you carry them out. If you fail the lieutenant you fail me. I do not take kindly to those who fail me. Do you get me?!\" The entire platoon shouted back, \"Sir, We get you, Sir\" except for Mr. Scars. Driscoll did not think he would start giving him problems so soon but was glad he did. Driscoll took the initiative and stomped straight up to him, screaming, \"What is your problem trooper! You don't want to support the lieutenant, maggot!\" The entire bay was so quiet when the trooper answered in a calm voice everyone in the bay heard him, \"I will support the lieutenant but I will not support you.\" Driscoll had not really been mad just acting to get the platoon in line. Now he was mad. What was this guy's problem? \"Who do you think you are trooper? We have a chain of command in this unit. I am the senior sergeant here; you are just some dumb ape.\" Driscoll raised his arms as he spoke and covertly flashed a hand sign for Wong and Lopez to get ready. \"Maybe you need a lesson.\" His voice never changed an octave or cadence, \"Sergeant, you do not understand. I will support the chain of command and the Senior Sergeant. It will just not be you who will be in the Chain of Command.\" Driscoll laughed in the scarred trooper's face, \"Oh and why won't I be here trooper.\" Still no change in tone or voice the trooper said, \"Because Wilson sent me to make sure you wouldn't.\" Driscoll stood still, completely in shock for a second. All that ran through his mind was, \"How did this recruit know Wilson? He was executed six months ago.\" But that second was all Walker needed. The kick to the gut caught Driscoll completely off guard. He went reeling back into a couple of bunks. Wong and Lopez just gaped at what had just happened to their leader. The rest of the platoon could not believe what they were seeing. NCOs dealing out punishment beatings was one thing but troopers provoking and attacking NCOs was another. None of this stopped Walker. He used the momentum from the kick to spin and kick Lopez in the head taking him out of the fight and scattering the formation. Still moving Walker stomped Wong's foot then put him in a sleeper hold until the trooper was unconscious. Driscoll finally unraveled himself from the bunks. Coming up the first thing he saw was Wong and Lopez down on the floor. The next was the barrel of the scarred trooper's pistol aiming at him. The same emotionless voice came out but now a ring of command authority was mixed into it, \"Alpha section, secure the prisoners on the ground. Senior squad leader call the Officer of the Day and the Duty Platoon. Senior Sergeant Driscoll you will come with me.\" Private Lee and some of the other new recruits Walker had trained moved without hesitation and grabbed Wong and Lopez. The rest of the platoon remained in place. They were either replacements too or had known something was not right about their Senior Sergeant. If they had to choose sides they chose the new trooper Garcia was looking at Driscoll completely stunned and for some clue of what to do. But it was the scarred trooper who told him, \"You, join your leader. Now!\" As what remained of his special squad moved toward him, Driscoll swallowed and found his voice, \"If I don't?\" Again the voice did not change one bit, \"Then I will shot you and lead the duty platoon to Bay 34.\" Driscoll now felt the beginnings of real fear creep into his gut and up his spine to lodge firmly in his brain. Bay 34 was where Carter was meeting the fleet guy to move the recovered goods. He could feel all his plans start to unravel. One look at the scarred trooper's burning eyes and Driscoll knew he meant it when he said he would shoot him. Putting his hands he started moving to the door.[Chapter 4] Chapter Three Taking a ship to no where 3rd Lt. Constance Harper stood outside Captain Daly's cabin door along with Danny and another, 3rd Lt Meredith Langley also from their class. All three were preparing to meet their new company commander. Lt. Harper wondered, \"If this company needs three officer replacements they must have seen some bad action.\" Her thoughts were interrupted by Danny, \"You know this Captain Daly, don't you. What is he like?\" \"Yes, he was my platoon leader, recommended me for OCS. Nice of the Mobile Infantry to put us back together.\" \"Yeah, real nice that the two of you can be together again.\" \"Knock it off Danny. He's a smart leader and good fighter. If anyone will give us a fair review it will be Captain Daly.\" Before Danny could say anything else there was a shout of \"Enter\" from inside the cabin. The door whooshed open and the three officer trainees filed in. Once they were standing in front of their new Captain's desk they halted and then turned to face him together. As one they all rendered a salute and said, \"Reporting as ordered Sir.\" Captain Daly looked up and then looked over each of his new officers one by one. After a minute he returned the salute and said, \"At ease.\" As they settled into position Constance took a moment to glance at her former and current commander and compare the two. Basically he had not changed much in the months she had been away at the Officer's Training School. His hair and eyes were still the same shade of brown with maybe a little gray now showing in his hair. He did not seem to have lost or gained any weight and could not have lost any height so he still must be a muscular 5'10\" and 210 pounds. His face was paler then she remembered but the unit had been aboard ship for a month now rebuilding. The one real thing about him had not changed. He still generated that air of leadership some people are born with. The troopers under his command followed him not out of a sense of duty or orders but because they instinctively knew he had their best interests and the Federations at heart. In a gravely tone Captain Daly said, \"This company goes back into the line in one week. I am going to be talking to all of you more in depth before we do. Right now there is only one thing I want to make crystal clear. You might think you are on your last training mission and that the most important thing is getting a good review. That is most definitely not the case. You are the officers leading these troopers. You are responsible for completing your given mission and bringing home as many of your troopers as you can. If you spend your time and energy wondering how to impress me then you will fail. And failure means not only failed missions but dead troopers. Neither is acceptable to me.\" Captain Daly sat back in his chair and continued in a much more relaxed and fatherly tone, \"All of you are combat veterans and all of you have lead leads into hell before. Just do what they taught you to do at the Academy and what you already know and I promise you you won't need to worry about your review. You will succeed.\" Before the three trainees could take in everything their new commander had just said the cabin door opened and a Fleet Officer stuck her head in. Captain Daly sprang to his feet and started to say, \"What is the …\" The Fleet Officer ignored everything and called loudly, \"Major Daly one of your platoons is staging a riot in Cargo Bay 34. Captain wants you down there Now!\" Captain Daly started moving and saying, \"Come on it has to be one of your threes platoons.\" Following the Fleet Officer the four Mobile Infantry Officers quickly found their way through the many decks and corridors of the Anthony Wayne to the supposed riot in Cargo Bay 34. What they found more closely resembled a Mexican standoff. The five officers stood on the outside of a ring of duty platoon troopers all armed with shock sticks. In the middle of the ring most of 1st Platoon stood together forming a living barrier. Inside this barrier was the open hatchway of a shuttle craft. Standing in the hatch was a much scarred trooper. Kneeling on the hatchway ramp were a Fleet shuttle pilot, the 1st Platoon Senior Sergeant and three 1st Platoon troopers. The scarred trooper was holding a pistol on the five and apparently they were his prisoners. Lt. Harper stared at Private Walker completely dumbfounded. Whatever was happening here had to have a reasonable explanation but she could not think of one. The one thing that did go through her mind was that Private Walker had said he was going to be assigned to her platoon. That meant everything that was happening in front of her was her responsibility. Her career was ending right in front of her eyes. Captain Daly saved her when he shouted out, \"Private Walker what in the name of our great Federation is going on here?\" Walker called out, \"Officer on deck!\" and then saluted with his free hand. The troopers forming the ring all smartly came to attention. Walker dropped his salute and said in his dead emotionless tone, \"Captain Daly I would like to report a discovery of misconduct between these troopers of your company and this Fleet Officer and most likely several others who are not present at this time.\" Shuttle pilot Lt. Allie Fausman squawked out in a panic stricken voice to the other Fleet Officer who had arrived with Captain Daly, \"Sir get this crazy man off of me. I have done nothing. He keeps pointing a gun at me and threatening to shoot me. I am innocent. These apes are the ones who are responsible.\" Lopez started to say something but Driscoll hit him in the chest and he began choking. Driscoll then looked over at the officers and said, \"Captain Daly my troopers and I would like to see an arbitrator.\" Glancing at his three co-conspirators Driscoll continued, \"Until then we will remain silent as is our right.\" Letting out a sigh, Captain Daly looked to Walker and said, \"Private Walker I want a full report on what is going on and why you are holding these troopers and your Senior Sergeant at gunpoint.\" \"Sir, yes Sir. Before coming aboard the Anthony Wayne I received information of an illegal operation being performed by members of 1st Platoon, Bravo Company.\" Using his free hand Walker pointed to the entrance hatch of the shuttle craft and continued, \"Inside this vessel, in crates marked for deceased troopers' personal property are actually properties of former colonists of this world we are orbiting.\" Gesturing to the five military members he was holding captive, Walker then said, \"These traitors to the Federation have been collecting these things for a price and shipping them back to the colonists. Always instead of completing their assigned missions and often at the expense of other troopers and Fleet personnel and sometimes costing the Federation the lives of soldiers who needed them to be somewhere they weren't because they were collecting trophies and knickknacks.\" At this announcement there was a very wide range of reactions from all those present in the bay. Many were shocked at not only the accusations leveled against the prisoners but also a few who knew that Walker had only just arrived that he had known any of this was going on. Many of the old hands in the platoon were either relieved that the Senior Sergeant had finally been caught or dumbfounded that all this had been going on without them knowing about it. Others were just puzzled about who this new and much scarred trooper was. The officers were almost all outraged except for Captain Daly. The Fleet Officer moved forward to try and take control of the situation but Captain Daly put a restraining hand out and stopped her. He then said to Walker and everyone else present, \"This is a very serious matter. We are going to need to bring Military Intelligence in to discover the truth. In the mean time I want everyone to return to their barracks and prepare for questioning by Military Intelligence.\" Stepping up to the shuttle he continued, \"Except for Senior Sergeant Driscoll and his little group. Duty Platoon Escort them to the brig and keep a sharp eye on them. If they even think of escaping the entire Duty Platoon will be flogged. And put a guard on this shuttle until Military Intelligence can inspect it too.\" Moving past the prisoners Captain Daly addressed Private Walker, \"Put the pistol away and go do what I brought you here to do.\" Walker looked at the Captain and with the barest hint of a smile in his voice said, \"Sir, This is the first step and their will be a few more like it before we can even try to begin. Sir.\" Private Walker then saluted and holstered his pistol. In a commanding voice he called out, \"You apes heard the Captain. Get back to the barracks and prepare to have your minds fried by the psychic boys and girls. Move it.\" As the troopers began to move and file out of the cargo bay, Lt. Harper and the other two new lieutenants approached Captain Daly. When he saw the trio he took a moment and then said, \"3rd Lt. Mallory you have 3rd Platoon, 3rd Lt. Langley you have 2nd Platoon, 3rd Lt. Harper you have 1st Platoon. There is going to be a lot of hell in the next few days on top of getting ready for our return to the line. I expect all of you to have your platoons ready and may God help you if you don't because the bugs certainly won't.\" The three new lieutenants all snapped to attention and rendered a salute. When Captain Daly returned it they all turned on their toes and moved to get their platoons ready. Captain Daly then said, \"Lt. Harper a moment of your time, please.\" Danny shot Constance an \"I told you so\" look but she ignored him and stood at attention in front of Captain Daly. Once the room was clear he gave her a smile and said, \"Connie I am not doing you any favors and in fact have given you a special problem to deal with. Just let me give you two pieces of advice. Promote Private Walker as fast as you can and listen to what he has to say no matter how strange you find it. He will not disappoint you.\" Constance wasn't sure what to make of everything that had happened and what the Captain had just said. But she had been through fire and war with him and trusted him completely. She answered simply, \"Sir yes Sir.\" And then she walked out to take charge of her new platoon, all the time wondering what she had gotten herself into.[Chapter 5] Chapter Four What a week we have had Private May Jong Lee had not really known what to expect during her first week assigned to a Front Line Mobile Infantry Platoon. She had imagined more of the usual hard and grueling training and also some not so funny hazing by the old hands. She was sure she would be meeting combat veterans who would tell her horror stories their encounters with the Arachnids and about themselves. The one thing she had not imagined was that she would be a police officer making arrests of other troopers and of Fleet personnel. During the incident in Cargo Bay 34 she had only been reacting to not only the training she had received in basic but also to the training Walker had put them through. He had not only given them special training but had instilled in them a desire to follow him. When he had given the commands all of his hand picked people had fellow troopers had not hesitated to obey his commands, including May. Thinking back on what had happened she smiled. She had only reacted like the rest of Walker's handpicked squad. But when she had time to think about it later she realized just how much trouble they could have been gotten into. Taking your Senior Sergeant a prisoner was not something that SICON would forgave very easily. They could have all been hanged or worse for that. Of course when all of Walker's accusations have proven to be completely accurate, the squad had not been punished but given a unit commendation. The most unexpected thing to happen was to Private Walker himself. The pretty lieutenant had instead of writing him up, had actually given him a promotion. In fact she had done better then just promoted Private Walker to the next rank of Lance Corporal or the one after of Corporal. He was now Sergeant Walker and the squad leader of 4th Squad, 1st Platoon, Bravo Company. She had even allowed him to pick which of the new trainees would be in his squad. He had of course kept his promise and picked her and the rest of those he had promised would be in his squad. The pretty lieutenant had even allowed him to pick who he wanted for his Lance Corporal and Corporal in the squad instead of assigning troopers to the position for him. May had been hoping for and dreading this part actually. She did not feel she was could lead or was ready to lead she had not had much experience at it even in basic. But she also knew that if Sergeant Walker did pick her as one of his Non-Commissioned Officers then she would be able to spend more time with him. It was a silly little girl's notion but one she couldn't help herself feeling. In the end Sergeant Walker had done the practical thing, as always, and appointed two of the veterans who had been working with him on the Olympus . Travesty had already been a Lance Corporal and the other one, Spegielman had been in three different campaigns even though he was only 18 years old. Sergeant Walker had gotten the pretty lieutenant to promote them. Now Sergeant Walker had everything and everyone exactly where he wanted them, for now at least. May was very happy for Sergeant Walker and to be in his handpicked squad. Her happy thoughts ended rather quickly when she suddenly realized that Sergeant Walker's new rank also meant he would be spending more time in the company of the pretty lieutenant then with her since she was just a lowly squad member. Hitting herself in the head, May realized she needed to stop calling her commanding officer \"the pretty lieutenant\". It was disrespectful and her parents had taught her better then to be disrespectful to anyone especially her superiors. Then again after everything else that had happened this week maybe they should start showing her some respect. Sure once they had left Cargo Bay 34 the entire company had been locked down for a whole day while the telepathic specialists from Military Intelligence interviewed everyone. Even the just arrived replacements had been screened. She could not say it had been a pleasant experience but since she had obviously not done anything to warrant the Military Intelligence's attention, her time with them had been very short. Some other members of the company had not been so innocent though. The telepaths had found quite a few violations from among the troopers. Seems there was a thriving black market for many hard to obtain goods many of the troopers had been missing. Shutting it down and confiscating everything had not made anyone happy except the Military Intelligence people and Sergeant Walker. As soon as the platoon had been cleared and a new Senior Sergeant selected, Sergeant Walker had gotten the squad volunteered for some extra special training. The first thing Sergeant Walker had lead them on was a raid on the Anthony Wayne's infirmary. It turned out a couple of the chemistry techs had been producing steroids in one of the labs and selling them to Mobile Infantry troopers looking for any edge. They had only been armed with tranq guns and the techs surrendered very quickly and were then turned over to Military Intelligence but still she recorded it in her journal as their first real organized action. As the week rolled on other illegal activities had been brought to light and ended by Sergeant Walker, Military Intelligence and 4th Squad, 1st Platoon of Bravo Company. The most common were some floating gambling games, most of which had turned out to be rigged. The most embarrassing was a prostitution ring several Fleet Officers, both male and female, had been running in one of the training simulators. This had also lead to a discovery of many falsified training records. This offense was considered even more serious an offense then gambling or prostitution. The most grueling part of all this whole week was that Sergeant Walker and the new Lieutenant and the new Senior Sergeant, another veteran who had been in the platoon for a few months named Van Horn, wanting to show he was not like the old Senior Sergeant had instituted a training program to insure that 1st Platoon was ready for the real job the Mobile Infantry had trained them for, which was killing bugs by the millions. May had thought basic training was the most time demanding and exhausting thing she had ever been through. Between the check out training for the new platoon leaders and police raids for Military Intelligence and the regular duties that were demanded of them she had no time for anything else. Even the simple things like eating, sleeping, and toilet could only be snuck in when no one was looking or at least when a buddy covered for you. Of course thinking back on this week the one person who had been covering for her and helping get any of the basics done had been the new Lance Corporal Spegielman. They had talked a little while Sergeant Walker had been training them. She had not thought him any different from the others then. Now that she took a moment to think about the last week the Lance Corporal had done her several favors so she could at least get some sleep. She could not remember seeing or hearing of him doing this for anyone else. There was only one reason she could think of why Lance Corporal Spegielman would do this for her and only her. Sergeant Walker must have told him to do it. Yes that must have been it. Sergeant Walker had really noticed her and was doing something to take care of her. He must have told Lance Corporal Spegielman to make sure she at least got enough sleep. He must actually care for her a little more then the others. The only thing everyone had been doing with the little free time they did get was to try and decide if anyone had won the betting pool on who or what Sergeant Walker really was. Some said it was obvious that he worked for Military Intelligence since he knew all about the things former Senior Sergeant Driscoll had been up to as soon as he walked into the platoon barracks. Only a psychic could have known this so those who bet he was Military Intelligence said they had won. Lance Corporal Spegielman had ended that claim by simply saying if he was a Military Intelligence telepath then the Military Intelligence guys would have taken him with them when they left. He was betting Sergeant Walker was a Sky Marshall performing a secret inspection and had all kinds of information he would use to find out what he needed for his special report. This idea started a whole knew line of betting and even wilder ideas about who he was. None of this mattered to May. She knew who he was to her.[Chapter 6] Chapter Five A conversation with yourself and a few hundred thousand listeners Warrior Group 5746 report cave in due to Human bombardment at Northeastern Terminus of secondary breeder cave. Worker Group Alpha Phi Omega go to Northeastern Terminus of secondary breeder cave, clear all debris and reinforce to level Charlie. Far under the planet's surface of the world humanity had designated as Longanus Minor IV a particular Arachnid sat and thought. That was this Arachnids purpose to think and plan and direct this colony. The Humans called it a Brain Bug. The Brain Bug did not have a sex but to most of the enemy it fought they considered it a he and so it thought of itself as a male. The humans gave the designation of female to the Arachnids they called the Queens. Most of the other Arachnids were considered males by the humans. For the humans to do this only showed how little they understood of the Arachnids. Breeders report 50 Blisters grown and ready for deployment. Breeders also report the lose of four breeders due to overexertion. New Blister Group Delta Nine Two report to link up with Warrior Group 9263. Breeders replace lost breeders three fold and continue with replacement of Warriors, Tankers and Blisters in that order. The Arachnids did not use sexual designations among themselves. Individual identity did not matter at all to the Arachnids. All that mattered to the Arachnids was continuing the purpose to which the entire Arachnid race was not only dedicated but created for. That purpose was simple in the extreme. That purpose was to grow and expand until there was no where left for the Arachnids to grow. Workers report food levels for Southeastern quadrant compromised by flooding in the storage cavern. Chariots from Delta Two relay food to Southeastern quadrant secondary storage chambers. Reporting Workers repair flooded storage chambers. Report when repairs are complete or if repairs can not be made. Of course all other life must be eliminated to achieve this purpose. The Arachnids did not feel malice or jealousy or hatred of other species for trying to stop the Arachnids purpose. It was simply accepted that these other species would be trying to grow and expand just like the Arachnids were. It was simply that they could not be allowed to. The Arachnid race was the only race that would be able to. No other race would stand, sit, jiggle, fly or swim in the path of the Arachnid purpose. Warrior group 4554 has stopped Human incursion into tunnels at coordinates 26:47 by 55:82, no loss of Warriors from group 4554. Indications are that that was only a scouting probe. Double guard with Warrior group 7863. Hold until further instructions. PAUSE. Warrior group 7863 no response. Last contact with Warrior group 7863 was by entrance to Trace Magma. Warrior Group 452 investigates lost contact with Warrior group 7863 and report. Warrior Group 9263 link Warrior Group 4554. The humans were so far proving to be the most difficult of the races yet encountered. Some other races had fallen in less then a week with only one colony needed. But the humans had somehow managed to hold out against the purpose for more then ten years now. The cost to the Arachnids had been in the billions of lost Arachnids. Entire planets had been taken away from the purpose of the Arachnids. Some were lost to the purpose permanently as the humans used weapons which left the entire planet useless to the purpose and to any life what so ever. Plasma Battery Epsilon Mica Seven reports no activity or targets of opportunity during the last planetary cycle. Plasma Battery Epsilon Mica Seven relocate north 25 kilometers and prepare to fire at orbiting human craft. The humans on this world were proving just as difficult. The Brian Bug had been born on this world. Born knowing its purpose was to attempt to add this world to the purpose. The Brain Bug was born knowing that its failure to accomplish the take over of this world would also be acceptable to the purpose. This planet was a food chamber for the Humans. Stopping them from using it for this purpose for as long as possible was good enough for the purpose. Succeeding or failing did not matter. The Brain Bug did not have pride or ambition or any goal other then to serve the purpose of its race. If it could take over the entire world for the purpose the Brain Bug would not even be content. The Brain Bug would just continue to serve the purpose. If the Brain Bug failed it would be dead and would not matter what it thought. In fact the Brain Bug had already set up an egg cache and some breeders in a location not connected to the current colony. If it should fail then they would wait one year and then start the battle for this planet again. Workers report food chamber in lowest level is now completed. First crop of fungus will be ready for harvest in three planetary days. When first crop is harvested bring half to breeders in primary hatchery and the other half to new storage chamber in Southeastern quadrant. The Brain Bug took a moment to review the latest part of the plan for removing the humans from this world. Everything seemed to be in order. All Warrior Groups were in position. All Worker Groups had been displaced back and reassigned to other duties. Supporting units were all in place. This attack would not succeed. This was not the point of this attack. The point was to do something the Brain Bug and others of the Arachnid race had discovered about the humans. The point of the attack was to break the morale of the Humans. Morale was something the Brain Bug had not understood at first but after much deliberation had discovered its meaning and more importantly had discovered a way to use morale against the Humans. All Warrior Groups and Supporting Groups assigned to attack upon Human Group Alpha One move into final attack positions. The Humans liked to think that some areas of the planet had been taken by them. They like to think themselves they were secure and safe from attack. They like to take some time away from their purpose and engage in many baffling activities which did not contribute to their purpose of conquering all of the worlds in the galaxy and spreading themselves throughout the universe. Taking away these secure areas was not necessary. All that was necessary was for the Arachnids to show they could and would attack the Humans anywhere and everywhere. This would break their morale. When their morale was broken they became easier to defeat. This one unsuccessful attack would prove more devastating then all the victories to date during the battle for this world. All Warrior Groups and Supporting Groups assigned to attack upon Human Group Alpha One begin the attack.[Chapter 7] Chapter Six Convincing the prom queen to go on a date 3rd Lieutenant Constance Harper had not known what to expect the first time she would be leading her very own troopers on to a bug infested planet. One thing for sure it had not been a shuttle landing to a prepared runway carrying their bags with them. She had thought it would be more like the other drops she had made. Full combat gear and drop capsules and having to fire to clear a space to land among a sea of deadly Arachnid Warrior Bugs. Heck when she and her troopers had gotten off the shuttle after a smooth landing, there had been a welcoming committee to give them directions to their barracks and an orientation briefing. Of course after the last week aboard the Anthony Wayne she should have expected nothing less. 3rd Lieutenant Constance Harper had been planning her training program and course of action to have her very first platoon be a complete success. Her entire program had been based on everything learned in ten years of warfare with the bugs and more importantly based upon the experiences she had had while fighting that war. All of that had been completely thrown out the porthole by one lone non-commissioned officer. Not even her new Senior Sergeant, Van Horn could compete with Sergeant Walker and the ideas and tactics he kept throwing at them. Everything she knew how to do and had been doing for years was challenged. Lieutenant Harper could not decide what the most annoying thing about Sergeant Walker was. It was either the way he presented his new ideas which was to say never rudely, never excitedly and never wrong. He just approached her properly and stated what he wanted just like the first time he had approached her. Thinking about it a little bit she realized it must be the never wrong part. Everything he suggested or demonstrated was truly better then the tried and true ways she had learned. No, that could not be it. The most annoying thing is was that he never ever even the one time she had ordered him to tell her anything about where he had learned or dreamed up all of the new tactics he was teaching her and the platoon. No she finally had it. The truly most annoying thing about Sergeant Walker was his shooting ability. Aboard the Anthony Wayne in the simulator training he had made some shots the technicians running the damn thing said could not only be made but would never work on the Arachnids. Sergeant Walker never got mad or cross or upset. He just told them the shots would work or they should change the parameters of the program. The point he had been trying to make was and she knew this fact from hard experience Mobile Infantry Troopers usually used hundreds of rounds of ammunition to bring down one bug. Sergeant Walker claimed and often tried to succeed despite the simulator restrictions to bring down Warrior bugs with just one round. He often said anyone could learn to do it. The Mobile Infantry trained troopers wrong just to keep the peddlers of ammunition in business. Constance did know one thing. She had seen the remains of a lot of troopers whose positions had been overrun when they eventually ran out of ammunition no matter how much they had started with. The bugs never seemed to run out of bugs. Waking up in her private room in Officer's Country she had been able for about two minutes to put all thoughts of Sergeant Walker out of her mind. Waking up in a real bed on a real planet with real air for the first time in months she had allowed herself those two minutes and just remembered what it was like to wake up when she was a child at home in Idaho and not have anything to do that day. Unfortunately she had a lot to do that day and 30 troopers waiting for her to tell them what to do with their day. No more time to lie in a comfortable bed and relax. As soon as 3rd Lieutenant Constance Harper walked out of the Officer's barracks on her way to make sure the troops had eaten breakfast she found quite a surprise. Her entire platoon was standing in formation apparently waiting for her. In front of the formation stood her Senior Sergeant Van Horn and of course Sergeant Walker. Both of them saluted as soon as they saw their commanding officer. Letting out a sigh, Lieutenant Harper marched straight up to Senior Sergeant Van Horn and saluted quickly. Dropping the salute she asked, \"Good morning to you also Senior Sergeant. Why is the platoon here to greet me?\" Senior Sergeant Van Horn also dropped his salute and then stumbled for a moment looking for words and then said, \"Good morning to you also Herr Lieutenant. Fourth squad leader Sergeant Walker had a particular concern he felt required your immediate attention.\" Turning from Senior Sergeant Van Horn to the main frustration of her existence, Lieutenant Harper asked, \"Sergeant Walker what do you feel needs not only my attention but the entire platoon's attention on our first full day on planet?\" Sergeant Walker, who had dropped his salute with Senior Sergeant Van Horn's, turned his blazing eyes on her and simply said, \"This base camp is going to be attacked within the next four hours.\" Looking around her, Constance only saw the regular activities of troopers going around doing regular things. No one seemed to be rushing to prepare for an attack that would be starting very soon. A week ago this statement and the actions of her platoon would have had Constance calling for a Military Discipline Review Board and for lashes given to the offending troopers. After the week she had spent listening to and working with and seeing his ideas she was willing to give him at least a chance to explain this statement. \"Before we go to the Duty Officer and but the Quick Reaction Force and the entire base on full alert could you tell me how you know something no one else around here seems to know?\" Sergeant Walker kept his face perfectly straight and said deadpan, \"I have already taken the liberty of informing the Duty Officer. He has taken it under advisement and sent out additional patrols to stop the attack.\" A little confused Constance waited to see if Sergeant Walker would care to explain what was going on. He did after a moment. \"Sir this will do no good and in fact has weakened our ability to defend against this attack.\" Now Constance was really confused and decided to try and get something closer to the point. She then asked him, \"Why won't this help us Sergeant Walker?\" Sergeant Walker then went into one of the longest spoken segments she had ever heard from him. Normally he kept things short and demonstrated what he wanted. Now he said, \"Sir the bugs are not going to attack this base camp on the surface or even by air today. They may use some surface units but they will only be a diversion. The main attack will come from under the surface. I have located the primary insertion points. We will need to cover these points with Hel Flamers and Javelin Missile Launchers equipped with Firecracker Missiles. We can then cover the entrance tunnels with the Hel Flamers and then close the tunnels with the Javelins. This will cause the least amount of damage to the base camp. We will need to get this equipment and get into position soon to give the platoon a chance to go over their equipment and prepare positions.\" Feeling torn between frustration and a need to do something if this threat is real, Lieutenant Harper continued to ask questions, \"Sergeant Walker I ask you again how you know this attack will occur and more importantly where it will occur when no one else does? The base camp has sensors embedded to protect against just such an attack.\" Sergeant Walker then looked over to one of the guard towers where Mobile Infantry troopers were many the heavy weapons protecting the base camp. Turning his fiery eyes back onto his leader he explained in his long form, \"The camp has not come under enemy attack for more then three months. The troopers assigned here have begun to think the battle is almost over and are not taking things as seriously has they should be. They have positioned the weapons with \"safety\" in mind. The heavy weapons can not cover the interior of the camp. This is why the Bugs are going to tunnel under the base camp.\" Starting to play with the rocky soil with the heel of his foot Sergeant Walker then jammed the heel of his boot into the earth and continued, \"Last night I did some basic checking of our protections and found that the underground sensors have all been compromised. I then used knife edge listening to discover the entry points. I should also say I may have been wrong on the timeframe and we should have the platoon in position as soon as possible.\" Frustration began win out and Lieutenant Harper rallied herself to continue the questioning. She had to be very sure of this supposed attack. Arming and positioning her platoon in the middle of the base camp could lead to her not only losing her commission before she even got started. Worse still she could find herself drummed out of the Mobile Infantry and returned to life as a civilian. \"Sergeant Walker please tell me as quickly as you can how you know that sensors which are monitored 24 hours a day and have alarms installed in them to prevent tampering have been compromised when no one else knows this.\" Sergeant Walker locked up and looked straight ahead then said, \"Sir, the cockroaches Sir.\" At this answer even Senior Sergeant Van Horn, who had been standing quietly at attention the entire exchange between 3rd Lieutenant Harper and Sergeant Walker turned to gaped at him. Even the members of his hand picked squad seemed a little confused and lost at this answer. Lieutenant Harper mouth dropped open and after a moment just asked, \"Cockroaches Sergeant Walker?\" Sergeant Walker kept staring straight ahead and said very quickly, \"Yes Sir the cockroaches. They have sabotaged the sensors so it looks like they are working but they are not. The Bugs are coming.\" 3rd Lieutenant Harper no longer knew who she should think or feel. She knew cockroaches were on every planet where the starships of the Federation had visited. There just wasn't any way to keep them from sneaking on board and then sneaking off ship. Usually in the very crates the colonists brought with them to establish the colony. But to think these ancient Terran insects were cooperating with the Arachnids and had the ability to commit acts of sabotage. The only thing she could really think was that Sergeant Walker had flipped out completely. He must have sensed or more likely anticipated her reaction because Sergeant Walker continued without being prompted, \"Sir there are no Terran cockroaches here on Longanus. All the cockroaches here are Arachnids. They are scouts and intelligence gatherers for them. They are under the control of a Brain Bug. Do not worry I have taken care of them in the immediate area.\" This statement had to be the last straw. She had never heard of this before. She did not know what she should do. Looking around she took in her platoon. They were all waiting to see what she was going to do. Taking all of them in and then looking at their individual faces she saw that even with the wild claims Sergeant Walker was making that all of them trusted him. She fixed her gaze on Private Lee. She was one of the youngest and easily most naïve of her platoon. She had noticed she was also one of the most capable of her newbies. Private Lee trusted Sergeant Walker and she trusted her lieutenant to validate that trust. It all came down to that. Sergeant Walker had already earned the platoon's trust. Constance needed to earn that trust too. It appeared the only way she was going to do that right now was to back the person they trusted. Constance just hoped she wasn't throwing away a promising career on a crazy man. \"Senior Sergeant Van Horn go and take 1st Squad and go to the armory. I will let them know we need some heavy weapons for training today. Sergeant Walker you show me where this supposed attack will take place and what you think we should do about it. The rest of you get some food and bring some back for those picking up weapons. On the bounce now Apes.\" \"And I hope we really get attacked because if we don't there will be real hell to pay for it.\" Lieutenant Harper thought to herself.

Je ne retire aucun bénéfice financier de cette fiction. Synopsys de « Starships Troopers : Les chroniques. » : Basées sur les personnages du film « Starships troopers », les « Chroniques des Durs de Razak » relatent les campagnes menées par l'escouade de Gene Razak, lieutenant émérite et respecté par ses troopers ( les rocness de Razak) à travers les planètes contre les insectes. Les membres de cet escouade sont : Brutto, le sergent, Gossard, le mécanicien, Doc, Johnny Rico, Dizzie Flores et le télépathe et télékinesiste Carl Jenkins. Robert Higgins, jeune diplômé de journalisme, est chargé de les suivre tout le long de leurs combats contre les insectes. Cette fiction prend, comme contexte, le milieu du conflit. Elle se situe entre la campagne Hydora et Klendathu. Bonne lecture ! Quelque chose n'allait pas. Clochait et n'entrait pas dans le cadre de la guerre contre les insectes sanguinaires de l'espace. Jenkins, les sourcils froncés, l'air préoccupé, avait le regard levé vers le soleil de Tophet et son front se plissa : Oui, un élément n'allait pas. Le jeune empathe ne put étendre son analyse plus profondément car une sensation, familière, vint picoter sa nuque. Des images brouillées lui parvinrent au cerveau, tel des flashbacks d'une situation à venir. Se baissant, saisissant son arme, il hurla : « -Insectes ! Ils arrivent ! » De suite, le reste de l'escouade imita Carl et se mettant à couvert, scruta l'horizon. Le lieutenant Razac abaissa la visière de son casque et malgré le viseur, ne distingua rien dans le ciel. Mais il ne mit pas en doute l'alerte de Jenkins, car plus d'une fois, celui-ci leur avait sauvé la vie. Brutto et Gossard s'échangèrent un regard dubitatif et éloquent quant aux perfomances de leur télépathe. Mais des bourdonnements, déchirant le silence de Tophet et les masses ailées des insectes se profilèrent à l'horizon. Un escadron d'insectes ailées et hostiles plongea en direction de l'escouade et commença à cracher des dards venimeux et acérés. « -Feu à volonté ! » Ordonna le lieutenant Razac, en tirant vivement sur leurs ennemis. Rico, Florès et Brutto obéirent et arrosèrent les insectes de tirs nourris. Higgins, lâchant sa caméra, s'armant de son automatique, contribua, avec hardiesse, courage et maladresse, à la débacle des insectes. Débacle ? Comme sur les précédentes planètes, ces « bourdons » étaient coriaces et sous les balles des troopers, devenaient plus virulents que jamais. S'amassant en une horde monstrueuse, ils répliquèrent par des jets violents de dards et de venins. « -Doc, balles à plasma ! » Cria Razac, en constatant que l'escouade allait être submergé par le nombre. Doc, sanglé dans son maraudeur, visa soigneusement avant de déclencher des projectiles à plasma. Ceux-ci créèrent un mur de feu infranchissable pour les insectes et donnèrent un répit de dix minutes. Suffisant pour une demande d'évacuation. ….. Avisant une falaise, Razac ordonna à l'escouade de se réfugier sur sa hauteur. Higgins, bon dernier, se mit à escalader la falaise, soufflant et suant. A l'école de journalisme, il n'avait eu guère le loisir de faire du sport. Une carence impardonnable sur le terrain, en particulier, avec les « durs » de Razac qui tolérait le journaliste. Carl terminait son ascension lorsque soudain, il se pencha vers Higgins et s'exclama : « -Attention, Higgins ! Piège ! » Higgins s'immobilisa, paniqué et levant la tête, il vit Rico épauler son arme et viser en dessous de lui. Une chose frôla le pied de Robert qui, affolé et dégouté, aperçut une espèce de « punaise » géante qui agitait ses pinces dans sa direction. Ayant acquis des réflexes à force de fréquenter les troopers, le jeune homme saisit son automatique et pressa la gâchette. Mais la balle alla se ficher à côté de l'insecte qui, à l'aide de ses pinces, attrapa Higgins par les pieds et le traina derrière lui. « -A l'aide ! Il m'emporte ! » Appela Higgins, qui se débattait. Florès et Rico, avec une corde, descendirent en rappel la falaise et encercla la « punaise » et l'infortuné journaliste. « -Cesse de bouger, Higgins ! Recommanda la jeune femme, en tentant de trouver un bon angle de visée. Ou je te tire dessus ! » Robert essaya de ne plus esquisser un mouvement, tâche peu aisée et compliquée par la course de l'insecte qui avait décidé de l'emmener dans un tunnel. Mais Rico réussit à atteindre la « punaise », contrariant le plan de celle –ci qui libéra Higgins. Le jeune homme crut son calvaire fini. L'air épouvanté et inquiet de Florès l'alarma et le journaliste se sentit pris dans un étau de fer. « -Non ! Au secours ! » Hurla-t-il, s'égosillant. Un « bourdon » , surgi d'où on ne sait, s'était emparé d'Higgins avec ses pattes et l'emportait dans les airs. Les armes de Gossard, de Razac et de Brutto entrèrent en action et touché en plein vol, l'insecte dut relâcher Higgins qui, dans un cri de terreur, faisait une chute libre de plusieurs mètres. Sous l'impuissance de ces camarades. ….. Carl se concentra et tendant sa main vers Higgins, serrant des dents, les yeux fermés, amortit la chute du jeune brun par la force de son esprit. La sueur se fut sur ses traits fins de blond et ses efforts accentuèrent la pâleur, naturelle et délicate, de son teint. Ne contrôlant pas encore ses pouvoirs, Jenkins ne put déterminer le point de chute de Robert et ce dernier atterrit, assez brutalement, sur son sauveur. Carl n'eut que le temps de rouvrir ses yeux, d'attraper Higgins dans ses bras et de basculer en arrière, s'effondrant sur le sol de Tophet. Un éclair traversa l'esprit très réceptif du jeune blond et les yeux bleus du troopers s'écarquillèrent devant l'évidence de la solution. « -Ca va, vous deux ? S'enquit Rico, qui accourait vers ses deux amis. Carl, tu vas bien ? Carl ! » L'appel angoissé de son meilleur ami arracha Carl de ses pensées et rejetant Higgins au loin, le jeune télépathe n'eut aucun regard pour le journaliste auquel il avait sauvé la vie. Il s'éloigna, sans répondre à la question de Rico perplexe. Déconcerté par le comportement brusque et inexplicable de Jenkins, Higgins le suivit des yeux, se demandant ce qu'il avait encore fait de mal. Il croisa le regard intelligent et impénétrable du lieutenant Razac et se sentit mal à l'aise. Ignorant les raisons de l'examen du troopers. …. A bord de leur vaisseau d'évacuation, Rico, installé au côté de Carl, le dévisageait. Le jeune blond était demeuré silencieux depuis le sauvetage de Robert. « -Parle-moi, Carl. Fit Rico, doucement. Quelque chose te tracasse. Je te connais bien pour le voir. » Carl, aux sollicitations anxieuses de son ami et indifférent aux interrogations muettes de Dizzie, n'opposa qu'un visage indéchiffrable et buté. Higgins se tourna vers le télépathe et fut surpris de lire de la colère, des reproches dans les yeux bleus de Carl à son égard. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 2] Carl a l'air d'avoir des reproches à l'encontre du « paperboy » Higgins. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 2 : Sitôt la navette repartie vers le vaisseau « Valley Forge », en orbite autour de Tophet, les troopers quittèrent leurs armures et apprécièrent de pouvoir respirer sans leurs casques. Gossard, Doc et le sergent Brutto se retirèrent dans la salle des machines et le lieutenant Razak alla faire son rapport dans ses quartiers. Higgins fila vers sa salle de communication où il finaliserait ses images et son reportage. Carl, muré dans son silence, rentra dans le dortoir où il s'assit, les jambes pendantes, sur sa couchette. Il manifesta sa contrariété, par un air renfrogné, à Johnny et Dizzy qui l'avaient suivi, bien déterminés à savoir le fin mot de l'histoire. « -Je ne suis pas stupide, Carl. Fit Rico, décidé et d'une voix ferme. Quelque chose t'agace au sujet de notre journaliste. » Carl essaya de le dissuader de continuer sur ce domaine, en s'affalant sur le lit et en détournant la tête vers le mur. Mais Johnny, obstiné, s'approcha du jeune télépathe et nullement découragé ou intimidé par l'hostilité de son ami, le força à rencontrer son regard. Dizzy, les bras croisés, en faisait de même. « -Je ne suis pas fan de coïncidences. S'expliqua Rico, exposant ses idées. Ces jours-ci, Higgins a été souvent l'objet d'attaques des arachnides, de riffleurs et des skinnies. Je ne compte pas le nombre de fois où il aurait pu être tué mais non, les insectes tentent de l'enlever. Vivant. » Carl daigna, enfin, accorder son attention à ses amis et se redressant, il soupira, contrit et résigné : « -Robert et moi, nous sortons ensembles. J'ai promis à Higgins de tenir notre relation secrète et nous nous sommes montrés très discrets. Mais je n'ai pas pensé aux conséquences ! Je ne suis plus capable de le protéger ! Les Arachnides veulent m'atteindre à travers Higgins ! » ….. La souffrance et l'impuissance de Jenkins transparaissaient à chaque mot et le jeune blond, honteux de s'être ainsi épanché, se cacha le visage sous ses mains. Dizzy s'installa aux côtés de son ami et avec gentillesse, lui entoura les épaules de ses bras. Elle fut remerciée par un sourire de gratitude et las de Carl qui n'osait regarder Johnny. « -Pourquoi ne nous avoir rien dit ? Reprocha Rico, vexé du peu de confiance de son meilleur ami. Tu as cru que j'allais te juger parce que tu sors avec un homme ? Je vaux mieux que ça, Carl. » Carl perçut la déception de Johnny dans le ton de sa voix, sentant la culpabilité l'envahir. « -Pardon. S'excusa-t-il, penaud. Mais j'avais promis à Higgins… » Johnny ne désira pas accabler plus son ami et se détendant, il déclara, bravement et souriant : « -Dorénavant, tu n'auras plus de soucis à te faire ! Higgins est un Roughneck et l'un des notres. On veillera sur lui et gare aux insectes qui oseront s'en prendre à lui ! » Dizzy approuva, avec un clin d'œil : « -Compte sur nous, Carl ! Les Roughnecks s'entraident ! » Un plaisir et une fierté immense d'avoir de pareils amis emplirent le jeune blond qui sourit, rayonnant de soulagement. Après une ultime tape dans le dos du télépathe, Johnny et Dizzy se rendirent au mess. ….. Higgins, timidement, pénétra dans le dortoir. Incertain de l'accueil de son petit-ami, il fut soulagé de le voir sourire chaleureusement à son entrée. « -Viens, Robert. Appela Carl, tendrement et en tendant la main. C'est dingue ! Cela fait deux mois qu'on est ensemble et tu es toujours aussi timide ! » Le jeune brun rougit et vint se blottir sur les genoux du blond. Il riva ses yeux marrons dans ceux, clairs et si limpides, du télépathe et murmura : « -Tu n'es plus fâché après moi, Carl ? Je ferai des efforts pour mieux me défendre. Je te promets de ne plus être un fardeau pour toi. Mais ne me demande pas de rentrer sur Terre, s'il te plait ! » Abasourdi par cette supplique, Carl demeura sans réaction une longue minute puis il comprit. Il lut de la crainte, de l'angoisse dans les yeux si beaux de Robert et ému, il posa un doigt apaisant sur les lèvres du journaliste. « -Je n'étais pas en colère après toi. Confia-t-il, désolé. Excuse-moi si je me suis montré si froid tout à l'heure. J'étais énervé contre moi-même : Je n'ai pas su te protéger. A cause de mon conflit avec la reine des Arachnides, tu es en danger. Tu es ma faiblesse, Higgins… » Sur ces mots, Carl embrassa, fougueusement, Higgins et l'allongea sur sa couchette. « -Personne ne nous dérangera. » Assura-t-il, en sondant les esprits de ses camarades. Robert, avec un sourire coquin, le ramena à lui… A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 3] Jenkins et Higgins sont ensemble. Le reste de l'escouade semble bien accepter ce fait et sont prêts à protéger le journaliste de la reine des Arachnides. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 3 : La chaleur étouffante de la jungle luxuriante de Tesca, nouvelle planête infestée par les insectes, rendait la marche épuisante et usante pour les troopers. Vêtus légèrement et pouvant, enfin, respirer un air non recyclé, les « Durs de Razak » étaient tout de même éprouvés par la moiteur de l'atmosphère de cette planête. Seul T'Phaï, anciennement colonel des Skinnies sur Tophet, paraissait à l'aise dans la chaleur lourde de ce climat. Son peuple ayant besoin du soleil et d'une haute température pour vivre. Débarrassés des parasites qui contrôlaient leurs cerveaux et libérés par les troopers, les Skinnies s'étaient ralliés à la cause des Terriens : L'éradication des insectes et de leur reine. Robert, concentré sur le colonel T'Phaï et enthousiasmé de pouvoir filmer un Skinnie, filmait leur nouveau camarade de combat et commentait, bien fort, sa fascination et son émerveillement sur les capacités guerrières de l'extra-terrestre. Pris par ses éloges et son admiration, il ne vit pas Carl s'attarder volontairement et rentrer dans le champs de vision de la caméra. « -Je crois bien que je vais finir par être jaloux. Annonça Jenkins, sur un ton boudeur et l'air mécontent. Tu veux que nous te laissons seul avec lui ? » Higgins, voyant la contrariété de son amant, culpabilisa et immédiatement, focalisa sa caméra sur Carl. « -Excuse-moi ! Fit-il, contrit. Souris, mon ange ! La postérité doit avoir une bonne image de celui qui a explosé un cerveau ! Sans une arme ! Rien qu'avec l'aide de ses supers pouvoirs de télékinesiste ! » Mais Carl, avant la fin des louanges de son petit-ami, lui fit un clin d'œil espiègle et rejoignant Rico et Florès, adressa un tendre sourire à Robert. « -Je plaisantais ! Lança-t-il, taquin. Continue ton reportage sur T'Phaï, Higgins ! » Higgins oublia ,rapidement, sa frustration de ne pas avoir perçu la taquinerie de son petit-ami et se reconcentra sur son sujet de reportage. Soudain, Carl mit un genoux à terre, épaula son arme et cria : « -Arachnides ! » ….. Vivement, Razak imita Jenkins et mettant son scanner en route, il scruta les arbres et les fourrés : Des Arachnides, suivies par une colonne d'araignées, accouraient vers eux dans une vitesse prodigieuse. Razak effectua un geste de la main et les troopers apprétèrent leurs automatiques, attendant l'ordre de faire feu. Evaluant la distance qui les séparait de leurs ennemis, le lieutenant leva, lentement, une main et ordonna : « -Feu à volonté ! » Les automatiques entrèrent en action et la première slave éradiqua les insectes les plus proches. Mais ces derniers, kamikazes et téméraires, continuèrent leur avancée et rispostèrent. Ils obligèrent les Roughnecks à reculer de leur position. Higgins tirait et faisait un carton avec son arme, assisté du colonel T'Phaï qui excellait dans l'art d'abattre des araignées. Surgissant du ciel, suspendues à leur fil aux branches des arbres, des petites araignées crachèrent leur venin sur les troopers. Devant faire face sur deux fronts, presqu'encerclés, les « Durs de Razak » cherchaient à briser la ligne de l'ennemi. Ils oublièrent Higgins qui, acculé près d'un arbre géant, par deux Arachnides, essayait de faire à la situation. … Subitement, un cri, un hurlement déchirant plutôt, emplit le cerveau de Carl et le fit se ployer sous la puissance et l'intensité de l'alarme. Le jeune télépathe, les larmes aux yeux, la tête douloureuse, localisa la source de l'appel et se frayant un chemin vers Higgins, il lança à Rico : « -Il ne faut pas qu'ils aient Higgins ! Il est la cible de l'attaque ! » Rico, entendant cela, courut dans la direction de Robert dont l'arme était vide et visant soigneusement, abattit les deux Arachnides qui menaçaient le journaliste. Jenkins, Florès et le reste de l'escouade les rejoignirent aussitôt et protégeant Robert, mitraillèrent sans cesse. Mettant leurs ennemis en déroute. Une émotion submergea Jenkins qui faillit se déconnecter de la réalité. Le jeune trooper se gifla mentalement, récupérant ses esprits. Serrant des dents, une rage immense déferlant en lui, Carl continua de neutraliser les araignées et murmura, déterminé : « -Non ! Moi vivant, vous ne l'aurez pas ! » A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 4] Jenkins a découvert un secret concernant Higgins, son amant. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 4 : Les « Kamikazes » ne cessaient de cracher leurs dards et leurs venins sur les troopers qui les arrosaient de feu nourri. L'escouade aérienne soutenaient l'infanterie mobile et faisaient des brèches parmi les rangs Arachnides. Pourtant, il en venait toujours plus. Une jeune soldat, mettant son scanner en fonction, calcula le nombre d'insectes restant sur la colline de Klendathu, planète mère des Arachnides. Elle pinça des lèvres, réfléchit et fit signe à son escouade de se replier. La navette de récupération, pilotée par le lieutenant Ibanez, était prête à les recueillir. L'escouade monta à bord et son lieutenant allait rejoindre ses hommes lorsqu'un Arachnide, surgie de nulle part, l'attrapa par une jambe. « -Son of bitch ! Hurla-t-elle, en dégommant la pince qui la retenait. J'ai horreur des araignées et des insectes en tout genre ! Vous me foutez le cafard et la meilleure thérapie est de vous rayer de la surface de l'univers ! » L'Arachnide, surpris par la hargne de la jeune femme, dut la relâcher, une pince en moins. Il fut achevé par les hommes de la jeune lieutenant. « -Blue leader à Bêta leader. Fit la radio de la jeune femme, à bord de la navette. Vous me recevez ? » La jeune femme eut un soupir las : Elle n'aimait guère Intel et les « huiles » de la Sicon, ainsi que le commandant de la flotte, Marlow. Un imbécile invétéré selon elle. Mais résignée, la jeune femme accepta de prendre la communication : « -Je vous reçois, Blue Leader. Ici, lieutenant Cissy. A vous, Blue Leader. » La mine de la jeune femme se renfrogna sous les consignes de leur commandant en chef. … Des éclats de voix, véhéments et furieux, chargeaient le bureau de Razak d'électricité. Le leader d'Alpha Team, debout derrière son bureau, l'air sévère et déterminé, écoutait les protestations de Robert Higgins. « -Non ! Refusa Robert, catégorique. Non, je ne partirai pas ! Vous n'avez pas le droit de me renvoyer sur Terre ! Je ne quitterai pas Carl ! Non ! » Razak échangea un furtif regard avec Carl et un soupçon s'insinua dans l'esprit du journaliste. Les yeux écarquillés par l'incrédulité et une nuance de peine, le jeune reporter se tourna vers son petit-ami et vit, sans doute possible, la confirmation que Jenkins avait sa part dans cette décision. « -Carl, je t'en prie ! Supplia Robert, la voix tremblante et les yeux brillants. Tu m'avais promis ! Laisse-moi rester près de toi, s'il te plait ! » Jenkins, les traits défaits, ne sut que dire à la supplique de son amour. Il se mordit la lèvre inférieure jusqu'au sang, se retenant d'esquisser un geste tendre envers son petit-ami. Des larmes coulèrent sur ses joues et voyant cela, Robert se jeta dans les bras de son télépathe. Il sanglota, doucement et silencieusement, pris de remords d'avoir causé de la souffrance chez Carl. « -Je suis désolé, Higgins. Murmura Gene Razak, d'un ton plein de sollicitude. Mais votre présence met aussi en danger mon escouade tant que vous restez la cible des insectes. Je me dois de protéger mon équipe. » Acceptant, enfin, son réaffectation sur Terre, Higgins ne songea plus à protester. Il désirait profiter de la tendresse et de la présence de Carl, avant son départ pour la Terre. ….. La porte s'ouvrit, avec fracas et heurta le mur du bureau de Razak, avec violence. Interloqués, les trois hommes découvrirent une jeune femme, aux cheveux courts et d'un noir bleuté, sur le seuil de l'entrée. L'uniforme des troopers ne pouvait dissimuler la beauté sculpturale et harmonieuse de cette dernière dont les traits, gracieux et réguliers, et les yeux, bleux azurs, foudroyaient Razak. « -Bon ! Dit-elle, d'une voix froide et mécontente. Dites-moi de qui dois-je être la baby-sitter ? » Higgins se réfugia plus dans les bras de Jenkins qui lui sourit pour le rassurer. Le télépathe avait sondé l'esprit de la jeune femme et savait qu'elle était un élément sûr et hors pair de l'infanterie mobile. « -Désolé, mon lieutenant. S'excusa un Gossard, hors de souffle. Mais je n'ai pu l'empêcher de rentrer ! » La jeune femme eut une moue de mépris à l'égard du caporal Gossard et riva ses yeux à ceux de Gene. « -Lieutenant Cissy. Se présenta-t-elle, en faisant le salut règlementaire. Veuillez pardonner mon entrée un peu…Irrespectueux, lieutenant Razak. Mon escouade a été affectée à la sécurité d'un de vos membres. Robert Higgins. » Gene, qui appréciait les personnalités affirmées, ne lui tint pas rigueur et lui rendit le salut. Il intercepta l'admiration émerveillée de son caporal Gossard pour la jeune femme mais ne commenta pas. « -Higgins, voici votre garde du corps. » Annonça-t-il, simplement, en désignant le jeune journaliste au leader de Bêta Team. La jeune femme le jaugea sans un mot et indifférente à l'admiration de Gossard, salua le journaliste avant de dire : « -Venez avec moi pour le briefing, « Paper-Boy ». » ….. A travers l'immense baie vitrée du mess du vaisseau, Jenkins, debout, les doigts touchant le verre glacé, suivait l'évolution de la navette qui emportait Higgins vers la Terre. Johnny, auprès de lui, perçut l'inquiétude de son ami et posant une main apaisante sur l'épaule de Carl, il affirma : « -Ne t'en fais pas pour lui. Cissy et son escouade sont les meilleurs. Après nous, bien sûr ! » Carl, bien qu'angoissé, parvint à rire de la boutade de Rico. Il sentit la présence de Dizzy et le soutien, inconditionnel, de ses amis. « -Merci d'être là pour moi. Remercia-t-il, ému, sans quitter des yeux la navette. J'ai de la chance de vous avoir ! » Dizzy allait le charrier quand sous l'expression horrifiée de Jenkins, un tir de plasma atteignit la navette et le réduisit à une boule de feu. « -Non ! Hurla Carl, en s'effondrant à genoux. Non ! Pas Robert ! Non ! » Une immmense haine et de souffrance éclata dans le cerveau de Carl qui s'écroula, inconscient, aux pieds de ses amis. … Doc ressortit de la salle d'examen, la mine sombre. Il secoua la tête en direction de Rico, de Florès, de Brutto, de Gossard et de Razak. « -L'encéphalogramme de son cerveau est plat. Fit Doc, amer et triste. Aucune activité des synapses. Je suis navré mais Carl Jenkins est en état végétatif. » A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 5] Higgins serait mort, ainsi que toute l'escouade de notre lieutenant Cissy ? Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 5 : Les troopers, rassemblés autour de la capsule médicale de Carl, en silence, lui faisaient leurs adieux. Têtes baissées et l'expression résignée. Johnny contemplait son meilleur ami et son cœur se serra, de colère et d'impuissance, de le voir réduit ainsi : Un légume. Soudain, un appel confus et empli de parasites brisa le recueillement de l'escouade Alpha : « -Ceci est un sos ! Notre navette a été déviée de sa trajectoire et nous sommes cernés par les Arachnides ! Ici, lieutenant Cissy de l'escouade Bêta ! Je répête : Demande renforts et évacuation immédiate ! » Le reste du message se perdit parmi des cris, des crépitements de tirs nourris et d'interférences magnétiques. Johnny tressaillit, levant la tête vers leur lieutenant et vit la même incompréhension dans les yeux de son supérieur. « -Localisez le signal, Gossard ! Décida Razak, après une seconde de réflexion. Sergent Brutto, nous partons ! Mission de secours ! » Gossard, sans attendre, triangula l'appel et les autres membres de l'Alpha team, comme un seul homme, se précipitèrent vers l'armurerie et leurs vestiaires. Ils étaient pressés d'en découdre avec les insectes et de percer le mystère de la survie de la navette d'Higgins ! Enfilant son uniforme, Johnny eut une brève pensée pour son ami et serra des dents : Il allait pouvoir faire payer aux Arachnides l'état de Carl ! ….. A l'instant où la navette de secours, pilotée par Barcolow et le lieutenant Ibanez, commençait à faire rugir ses feux, l'image du commandant Marlow apparut sur l'écran de télécommunication. Ce dernier, l'air fermé, fusilla Gene Razak qui ne baissa pas le regard. « -Vous n'irez nulle part. Avertit le commandant de la flotte fédérale, sèchement. Cette mission n'est pas autorisée : Ce message est un piège ! Vous l'avez vu comme nous tous, lieutenant Razak. La navette a explosé ! Il n'y a pas eu de survivants ! » Dixy voulut protester mais le lieutenant Razak la devança, en s'adressant au pilote Barcolow, par sa radio : « -Décollez, major Barcolow ! La communication avec le commandant est très défectueuse ! » Le major Barcolow, non dupe et toujours prêt à secourir les troopers, acquiesça, d'un ton léger et détaché : « -Décollage imminent ! Préparez-vous aux turbulences ! » L'attitude désinvolte du pilote détendit l'ambiance et les Roughnecks eurent un soupir de soulagement : Ils n'allaient pas abandonner un trooper dans le pétrin ! … Johnny, en pointe de la formation, avançait lentement et avec précaution dans l'immense grotte souterraine : Alpha team était en plein territoire ennemi et ne bénéficiait d'aucunes couvertures pour assurer leurs arrières. Ni terrestre et ni aérienne. La lampe de son casque éclaira une arme abandonnée et le jeune trooper sut qu'il était dans la bonne direction. Il continua de progresser le long du tunnel sombre et aux parois rocheux. Brusquement, l'escouade s'immobilisa. Horrifiés par la scène qui se présentait devant eux, les Roughnecks ne purent réagir durant un laps de temps important. Momifiés dans des cocons translucides, les soldats de l'escouade Bêta paraissaient émaciés et inconscients. Autour des captifs, s'affairaient des petites araignées fébriles et appliquées. « -Robert ! » S'écria Johnny, en s'élançant vers le jeune journaliste. Higgins, à genoux, les yeux clos et les bras englués dans une espèce de carcan gélatineux, ne bougea pas au cri de Rico. Doc vint, prestement, examiner le jeune reporter et son front se fit soucieux et perplexe, en même temps. « -Qu'y a-t-il, Doc ? S'enquit Dixy, inquiète du mutisme de celui-ci. Comment va-t-il ? » Doc, conservant le silence, réexamina Higgins et son visage devint profondément incrédule. « -Il est anémié, lui et…Le fœtus. » Finit-il par annoncer, d'un ton hésitant et halluciné. Dixy ne put exprimer sa stupeur car les Arachnides ,qui, jusque là, les avaient ignorés, décidèrent de passer à l'attaque. … La vitre de la capsule de soin se fracassa, alertant les pilotes de la navette médicale et Carl, lentement et sous les yeux étonnés de ces derniers, s'y extirpa. Une expression de rage froide sur ses traits, le jeune télépathe se dirigea vers le cokpit de la navette et tendit la main vers les deux pilotes. Aussitôt, ceux-ci se tordirent de douleur et dans un hurlement effroyable, s'évanouirent. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 6] Higgins servirait d'incubateur à un alien ? Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 6 : Un bruit écoeurant de déchirure parvint aux oreilles de Jenkins et le jeune trooper, vivement, se saisit d'une arme. De la base des nuques des deux pilotes, surgirent deux minuscules insectes araignées. Les deux bestioles, agitant leurs pinces, tournèrent leurs yeux vitreux et globuleux dans la direction de Carl. Celui-ci, pressant la gachette, envoya une rafale meutrière sur les deux insectes et les neutralisa. Rapidement, il extirpa un pilote inconscient de son siège et prit la place de ce dernier. « -Tiens bon, mon ange ! » Murmura Jenkins, en entrant de nouvelles coordonnées dans l'ordinateur de bord. La navette vira, plongea dans l'atmosphère de Klendathu et dans une vitesse vertigineuse, survola un paysage désolé et chaotique. ….. « -Repli ! Hurla Razack, en ne cessant de tirer. Gossard et Florès, libérez Higgins et emmenez-le en lieux sûr ! » Dizzy s'empressa de libérer le jeune journaliste de ses liens et aidé de Gossard, elle tenta de l'emmener vers la sortie. Rico, Doc et T'Phaï les couvrirent, en attirant à eux les Arachnides. Submergés par le nombre, acculés vers le renfoncement d'une paroi, Razack et ses troopers approchèrent de plusieurs cocons. Doc, jetant un bref coup d'œil sur ces cocons, aperçut les silhouettes de l'escouade du lieutenant Cissy. L'escouade, entière, était momifiée et dans un état de stase approfondi. « -Lieutenant ! Fit Doc, en continuant d'éliminer le plus d'insectes possible. Que faisons-nous d'eux ? » Gene, serrant des dents, ordonna : « -On s'occupera d'eux plus tard ! Cela ne servira à rien de les délivrer maintenant ! Rico, tentez une percée ! » Rico, épaulant son arme, visa le plafond, chercha une cible et retenant son souffle, tira. Des stalactites se détachèrent de la voute et s'écroulèrent sur les Arachnides, transperçant leurs carapaces. « -Doc, libérez l'escouade Bêta ! Fit Razack, en maintenant les autres Arachnides à distance. Vite ! » La situation semblait s'éclaircir pour l'équipe Alpha : L'escouade Bêta, après injection d'un anti-venin, fut prompt à retrouver sa capacité de combat. Il restait peu d'insectes en état de combattre et Rico avait réussi à dégager un passage vers la sortie. Soudain, un cri épouvantable alerta les troopers. C'était Dizzy qui avait hurlé ! « -Non ! Laissez-le ! » Protesta la jeune femme, rageusement. ….. Une énorme masse se tenait devant Gossard et Florès qui, prêt à agir, reculaient pas à pas. Elle possédait plusieurs pattes et serrait Higgins, toujours inconscient, entre deux d'entre elles. Elle avançait, utilisant le jeune journaliste comme bouclier humain. Dizzy et Gossard, vigilants, ne la quittaient pas des yeux et évitaient de faire des gestes brusques. « -Il faut faire quelque chose ! Informa Doc, dans un chuchotement. Higgins est très affaibli et il ne survivra pas, sans des soins appropriés. Lui et sn bébé… » La dernière phrase de Doc faillit faire lâcher son automatique au lieutenant Razack qui, se détournant vers son médecin, l'interrogea du regard. Un Arachnide profita de la distraction du trooper pour le transpercer mais une rafale de tir coupa l'insecte en deux. « -Voilà pour m'avoir momifiée ! » Lança Cissy, en abattant d'autres insectes. Avec l'aide de l'escouade Bêta au complet, Gene et ses troopers finirent par isoler la reine des Arachnides. Celle-ci brandit Higgins, bien haut devant elle et se fraya un passage vers un tunnel. Subitement, elle se raidit et se figea. « -On ne touche pas à mes deux amours ! » Menaça la voix claire de Jenkins. Rico, surpris, s'élança vers Carl dont le visage était l'expression d'une fureur immense et d'une concentration intense. Il stoppa, devinant qu'une lutte, de quelque nature qu'elle fut, s'était engagée entre son ami et la reine. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 7] Jenkins et la reine des Arachnides s'engagent dans une lutte où l'enjeu est Higgins et son enfant. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 7 : Les Arachnides s'étaient figés et leurs attentions se focalisaient, immobiles, sur le duel engagé entre l'humain télépathe et leur reine. Les troopers retenaient leurs souffles, devinant que l'issue de ce conflit interstellaire dépendait de leur ami et camarade Jenkins. Gossard, mine de rien, se rapprocha de Cissy qui, elle aussi, se passionnait pour la bataille silencieuse se déroulant devant ses yeux. Consciente de la présence du jeune caporal, elle eut juste un sourire. Sourire qui fut ,immédiatement, interprêté comme un signe d'encouragement. Rico, en tête de l'escouade, à quelques mètres de son ami, suivait les expressions imperceptibles de Carl. Avec anxiété, il nota les traits tendus et les rides de douleur autour des yeux de Jenkins. Horrifié, il vit Carl plier un genoux à terre, comme cédant sous un poids invisible et grimacer de souffrance. « -Carl ! Fit Rico, en voulant intervenir et mettre fin à cette lutte. Arrête ou tu vas mourir ! » Mais soudainement, Jenkins se releva, mordit, avec violence, sa lèvre inférieure et l'expression de ses yeux se durcit. Du sang goutta de l'entaille que le jeune télépathe s'était infligé lui-même. « -Non … Murmura-t-il, dans un souffle. Non... Non ! Vous ne l'aurez pas ! Je ne vous laisserai pas faire ! Ils ne vous serviront pas à asservir l'humanité ! Non ! » Dans un cri de rage absolu, Jenkins se redressa de tout son être et les poings serrés, l'air résolu et meurtrier, il s'avança vers la reine. ….. La reine se recula, en proie à une terreur visible pour les troopers et tenta de mettre une distance entre le télépathe et elle. Lâchant brusquement Higgins, elle se faufila vers un tunnel souterrain et se sauva dans une vitesse fabuleuse. Carl ne la suivit pas. Il inspira, profodément et plusieurs fois. Essayant de refaire surface et de se débarrasser de la haine en lui. Son regard se posa sur Robert et la tension nerveuse disparut au profit d'un sentiment qui adoucit son visage. « -Robert ! Fit Carl, en s'agenouillant vers son amant. C'est fini, mon ange ! Je suis là ! Doc ! » Les troopers, abasourdis par la manière dont s'était achevé le duel entre Jenkins et la reine, se secouèrent, mentalement, et accoururent vers leurs deux amis. Les Aarachnides, dans une fuite éperdue, s'étaient sauvés et plus rien ne menaçait l'escouade de Razak et de Cissy. « -Il lui faut une transfusion d'urgence ! Diagnostiqua Doc, qui auscultait le jeune journaliste. Je ne peux rien pour lui ! Il faut le ramener au vaisseau ! » Carl fixa, intensément, le médecin et demanda : « -Tu pourrais procéder à l'opération dans la navette médicale ? Il y a le matériel nécessaire, Doc. Allons-y ! » Doc eut une grimace de mauvais augure. Il secoua de la tête, avant de déclarer : « -Ok, ok ! Mais le culot de sang…Tu veux le trouver où ? » Carl foudroya Doc, de ses yeux vifs et furieux et l'attrapant au col, amena le médecin près de lui. Rico et Florès essayèrent de s'interposer. « -On perd du temps à discuter ! Cracha Carl, son regard dans celui de Doc. Je suis donneur universel et s'il le faut, je lui donnerai tout mon sang ! Alors, on y va ! » Razak intervint, sèchement : « -Jenkins, n'oubliez pas que vous êtes un « roughneck » ! Lâchez-le ! » Carl sembla revenir à lui et sans une excuse, emporta Higgins sur le chemin de la navette. En silence, les troopers lui emboitèrent le pas. …. Assis dans la navette médicale qui les ramenait vers la flotte, les troopers discutaient, évacuant le stress et la tension dus à l'opération de sauvetage de leurs camarades. Cissy, sollicitée par le lieutenant Razak, expliquait comment elle et son escouade avaient survécu à l'explosion de leur navette. « -La navette n' a pas été touchée. Fit-elle, les sourcils et perplexes. Les pilotes ont changé de cap et nous ont déposés sur Klendathu, sans que nous ne pouvions y faire grand-chose. Là, des Arachnides nous ont encerclés et emmenés dans la grotte. Apparemment, ces saletés de cafards se sont emparés des cerveaux des pilotes ! » Razak écoutait, attentivement et paraissait songeur et soucieux. « -Nous avons été victimes de manipulation mentale de la part de la reine ! Devina-t-il, gravement. Sicon doit être mis au courant de cela : Les pouvoirs de la reine sont immenses et peuvent menacer l'intégrité des esprits de nos hommes siceux-ci sont trop près de Klendathu. » Les conversations cessèrent et tous les regards se tournèrent vers Razak et Cissy. Leurs propriétaires assimilaient ces informations, gardant leurs réflexions pour eux. « -L'enfant de Carl et de Robert avait sûrement un rôle à jouer. Supposa Rico, en lançant un coup d'œil dans la direction de son ami. Cela expliquerait l'acharnement des Arachnides à capturer Higgins vivant. » Les paroles de Rico ne rencontrèrent que le mutisme de Carl qui, pâle et appuyé contre la capsule de soin, couvait son amant d'un regard plein d'amour et protecteur. Le jeune télépathe ignora, ostensiblement, les interrogations muettes des troopers au sujet d'un phénomène biologique et physiologiquement impossible. Le fait que Robert, un homme, pusse porter un bébé. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 8] Comment Robert peut-il porter un enfant ? Réponse dans cette ultime partie ! Bonne lecture ! Partie finale : Robert, à demi-assis sur son lit d'infirmerie, écoutait les bavardages de l'escouade Alpha et souriant distraitement, il porta toute son attention à Carl qui, à ses côtés, lui tenait la main. Le jeune journaliste, encore pâle, était ébloui par l'amour immense lue dans le regard si bleu de son petit-ami et ressentait la chaleur de cette affection lui chauffer le cœur. « -Il faut que nous parlions, Jenkins. Décida Razak qui, d'un bref signe de la tête, ordonna aux autres troopers de sortir. Higgins, vous aussi, mon garçon. Nous devons régler certains détails concernant …Votre état. » Les autres troopers, non sans un coup d'œil éloquent vers le journaliste, les laissèrent seuls. Higgins, ne comprenant rien, manifesta son étonnement sur les dernières paroles du lieutenant. Ses sourcils se fronçèrent, signe de perplexité. Il se tourna vers Carl qui le contemplait, avec une gravité intense. Cela provoqua des frissons d'angoisse chez le jeune paper-boy. « -Que se passe-t-il, Carl ? Voulut savoir Robert, d'un ton incertain et plein d'appréhension. Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas chez moi ? » Il trembla en songeant que peut-être les Arachnides avaient pu lui faire subir des expériences. Carl, percevant les pensées du brun, le prit tendrement dans ses bras et lui murmura les mots les plus doux qu'ils pussent exister au monde. « -Vous devez retourner sur Terre, Higgins. Fit le lieutenant Razak, sans brutalité. La Sicon vous transfert dans une unité de soin, afin de s'assurer de votre bien-être et de votre sécurité. Ainsi que celle de la Terre. » La panique menaça de submerger le jeune Robert dont la détresse et l'angoisse transparurent sur son visage. Secoué par ce qu'il venait de vivre avec la reine des Arachnides, traumatisé et connaissant la réputation des unités de soin de la Sicon, Higgins chercha à s'arracher des bras de Carl. « -Non, lieutenant ! Supplia Robert, d'une voix poignante. S'il vous plait, ne me livrez pas à eux ! Puis, je ne comprends pas ! Quelle danger puis-je être pour la Terre ? Carl, ne m'abandonne pas ! » Le lieutenant Razak et Jenkins se consultèrent du regard et sans un mot, le leader de l'escouade Alpha s'en alla de la chambre. … « -Mon aimé, écoute-moi. Dit Carl, tendrement, en rivant son regard à celui de Robert. Tu as confiance en moi, n'est-ce pas ? » Higgins opina de la tête, sans hésitation. Avec une curiosité indéniable, il vit son amant s'approcher de lui, poser une main sur son ventre et apposer son front sur le sien. Une vague de chaleur pleine d'amour irradia de Carl et enveloppa le jeune Higgins dont une paix confinant à une plénitude envahit son âme et son corps. Les traits du journaliste se détendirent et brusquement, une émotion, teintée de surprise émerveillée, fit monter des larmes aux yeux de Robert. Comment avait-il pu ignorer le petit être qui commençait à pousser en lui ? Les larmes coulèrent sur les joues du jeune brun quand il ressentit l'appel de son fils et le lien de communication, qui se constituait entre Carl, l'enfant et lui. Robert sut que son fils avait cherché à entrer en communication avec lui et avait tenté de le protéger de la Reine des Arachnides, en bloquant l'accès aux pensées du jeune journaliste. Tout comme le jour sur Tesca où Carl avait perçu l'appel télépatique de secours de leur enfant alors qu'Higgins s'était retrouvé acculé par les insectes. Carl, plus réceptif et plus sensible, avait entendu les tentatives de contact de leur futur enfant. Il avait aussi saisi le motif de l'intérêt de la Reine pour Higgins et le bébé aux dons et aux pouvoirs immenses : Cloner le patrimoine génétique de l'enfant et le distribuer à la progéniture de la Reine auraient permis aux Arachindes de créer une armée d'insectes aux pouvoirs incommensurables. Robert perçut une onde douce se propager dans son esprit et dans une lumière éclatante, il eut la réponse à sa question : Son fils lui disait que des forces dans l'Univers avaient permis sa naissance miraculeuse et que celui-ci avait désiré naitre pour concrétiser l'amour inconditionnel entre les deux hommes. Carl, délicatement, mit fin à la fusion de leurs deux esprits et les deux amoureux, revenant à la réalité, se contentèrent de se contempler. En silence. ….. La flotte entière traquait le vaisseau de la Reine qui s'était enfuie de Klendathu. Selon Carl, celle-ci se dirigeait vers la planête Terre et il était urgent de la stopper avant qu'elle ne débuta l'invasion de la Terre. L'escouade Alpha et Bêta occupaient leur temps d'inactivité par des entrainements intensifs de musculation et de simulation de combat. Depuis qu'elles avaient combattu, ensemble, la Reine des Arachnides, les deux escouades étaient devenues bien proches et ce rapprochement était, certainement, facilité par la romance qui se dessinait entre un caporal et le leader de l'unité Bêta… Puis les membres de ces deux escouades partageaient le même secret au sujet de l'état de Robert qui avait été transféré dans une unité de soin de la Sicon. Le lieutenant Razak, avec l'accord des deux parents, les avait briéfé sur le mystère de la conception de l'enfant à venir. Il fallut deux bons mois pour que les informations furent digérées et acceptées par les deux escouades entières… « -Courrier ! Annonça un jeune trooper, avec des petits paquets dans es mains. Rico, pour vous ! Dizzy pour vous ! » Avec une hâte et un ravissement évidents, les troopers appelés s'emparèrent de leur courrier et s'isolèrent dans un coin pour les lire. A la grande déception de Carl, il n'y eut aucune missive pour lui. Le jeune trooper se mordit la lèvre inférieure, stressé par le fait que cela faisait bientôt un mois que Robert ne lui avait plus écrit. Rico, voyant la détresse de son meilleur ami, vint lui tapoter, gentiement, l'épaule. « -Ne t'en fais pas. Rassura-t-il, doucement. Je suis sûr que tout va bien pour notre paper-boy. » Touché par le soutien de son ami, Carl finit par lui sourire et se remit à ses exercises physiques. « -Un appel depuis la Terre pour l'officier Jenkins ! » Lança une voix, par l'interphone. Sans se faire prier deux fois, suivis par ses compagnons d'arme, Carl se pressa vers la salle des télécommunications. …. Inspirant profondément, Carl mit l'écran en route et se figea, les yeux écarquillés…D'émerveillement. Sur l'écran, Higgins, en tenue d'hôpital, l'air pâle et épuisé, lui souriait tendrement et tenant dans ses bras un bébé minuscule et adorable. Tous les troopers s'immobilisèrent et demeurèrent admiratifs et attendris devant le petit bout de vie enveloppé dans une chaude couverture de laine bleue. « -Bonjour, Carl. Fit Robert, avec chaleur et tendresse. Je te présente ton fils. » Avec délicatesse, le jeune brun positionna le bébé ,profondément endormi , face à l'écran pour que Carl puisse mieux apercevoir les traits de son enfant. Le bébé avait les cheveux chatains sables et ressemblait à Carl par ses traits fins. Le nourrison, comme pressentant la présence de son autre père, ouvrit les yeux et Carl retint son souffle : C'était le même regard de Robert et ses magnifiques yeux bruns, intelligents et curieux. « -Il est magnifique ! Murmura Jenkins, fasciné, ne pouvant détacher ses yeux de son bébé. Magnifique… » Les autres troopers, d'un commun accord, se décidèrent de partir pour laisser de l'intimité aux jeunes parents. « -Comment vas-tu ? Demanda Carl, en étudiant le visage épuisé de son amour. La Sicon ne te traite pas trop comme un animal de laboratoire ? » Une immense fierté envahit Jenkins lorsque Robert l'informa que leur fils l'avait protégé jusqu'à sa naissance, créant un bouclier mental contre les intrusions des autres télépathes. Ainsi les pensées de Robert avaient été préservées, à la grande consternation des techniciens de laboratoire. « -Il veut être appelé Carl Bobby Junior. Fit Robert, d'une voix timide et douce. Qu'en dis-tu ? » Carl resta silencieux, un long moment, mettant au supplice le jeune Robert avant de sourire amoureusement : « -Cela me plait bien. » A la lueur amusée dans les yeux bleus de Carl, Higgins sut que ce dernier l'avait fait volontairement « mijoté ». Lentement, avec douceur, Robert se pencha vers l'écran et apposa une de ses mains. « -Tu me manques, Carl. Déclara le jeune journaliste, gravement. Prends soin de toi, mon amour. Je voudrai que Carl Bobby Junior connaisse le bonheur d'être serré dans tes bras. » Presqu'avec solennité et timidité, Carl superposa sa paume sur celle d'Higgins et les deux hommes, pendant une éternité, ne dirent mot, ne communiquant que par le regard. Leurs mains se pressèrent contre l'écran, voulant effacer la vitre et la distance qui les séparaient. « -Je te le promets, mon amour. Fit Carl, d'un ton ferme et rassurant. Je te promets aussi ceci : Je ferai, tout ce qu'il faudra, pour que notre fils ne soit obligé de porter l'uniforme comme ses deux parents. » A cette promesse, Robert eut un sourire de gratitude et tandis que les deux amoureux se contemplèrent, Carl Bobby Junior cala son visage ,plus confortablement, contre le torse de son papa et s'endormit paisiblement.

You'll see some of the characters that you've come to know and some new ones as well. Yes I know other people have done things similar but I wanted to try my hand at it. Now things are different here and I know that . . . but seriously I have to do something while I'm stuck in this damned hospital bed and none of my other stories are willing to cooperate so we got this. A few things to keep in mind. One-these chapters are being written randomly while I'm in between tests so some may be long, some more along the drabble lines. And the timeline is probably going to jump around. Thank you to all of the people who've stuck with me through the past few years-it means the world to me. Oh and Songorita? You got your wish! Thanks to Midnight for putting up with my idiocy! I own nothing but my OCs and the ideas. Decisions March 2001 Memphis Raines sat listlessly beside the hospital bed his mother was all but confined to; watching the monitors and instruments blink and beep away the remaining seconds of her life. Because at this point-from everything the doctors had told him, Kip and Sway- this fresh white hell was going to be exactly that. The place where his mother spent her last few moments-seconds, days, weeks or maybe even months- before she died. In a tiny fucking hospital bed in so much pain she couldn't even stay awake. All because the treatments that would ensure she at least had some quality of life before she passed away were astronomical. Even with her painfully outdated and dickish HMO. He ran a shaking hand through his slightly longer blonde hair, uncaring that a new batch of tears was slowly trailing down his stubbled cheeks; dropping quietly to the ugly linoleum at his feet. He clenched and unclenched his hands, trying to force his sleep and sorrow addled brain to actually work. Everything in his life was supposed to be better now . . . not worse! He'd gone clean after the fallout with Calitri-true to his word- and had used everything to throw in with his old mentor. He'd rebuilt his life, pulling the crumbled remains back together from the ashes and cinders his mistakes had left in their wake as he'd started to reacquaint himself with his family. Sway, Kip, Atley and Donnie had come to work with him at Halliwell Restoration-Sphinx even throwing in when they needed him- while the disbanded boosts that had fled from Calitri's insanity had started to slowly trickle back into Long Beach. Hell, Hecksland Carmichael- who had become a pretty substantial runner for Big Eddie's group a little further South before Calitri's fuckery had sent them all away or into the ground- had even come to him almost four months before with an offer. He had a pretty good idea where Frankie the Fish and Santoro had hold up . . . and the crazed Irishman was more than willing to go grab the wayward boosts. He even drug Ripley- another of the boosts he'd worked with off and on in the old days- with him. He smirked for a moment, remembering just how well Ripley had taken being told she was going with the Irishman to collect Frank and San. She'd moved between her brother's crew and his own pretty easily before, picking and choosing her marks before he'd left-much to the chagrin of the Sphinx and Frank (the only thing the two ever agreed on). He shook his head, his momentary humor fading as he wondered how they were doing. Ripley-despite her aptitude for Europeans and conning was still young and wiry; the rather odd girl one of the youngest of the Old School boosts still running- and she didn't do well with longtime exposure to Sphinx, Hex and Frank. Actually it usually ended in bloodshed . . . and now that Sphinx spoke-well some - he knew once the quartet got back that life was going to be interesting. His smile fell completely as a beeping caught his attention, dragging him from his thoughts and back to the present. He watched the numbers change before steadying, the machines settling as he leaned back into the chair. He still couldn't believe all of this . . . not even two months ago his life had been pretty damn close to perfect. Now it was steadily circling the fucking drain. His mother had pancreatic cancer . . . and there was no possible way he could see for him to even attempt to make her comfortable. Otto had offered to 'buy out' his portion of the garage to try and give them something to go towards the bills and expenses-because he'd already refused the Halliwells offer of flat out giving him every spare penny they had more than twice- but even with that gesture it still wasn't enough. She could be out of the hospital and doing home health for all of two months before she would go right back in . . . and they all knew that if she left and went back in she wouldn't be coming back out. He shook his head, letting his hands fall again as he stared at the floor. Maybe the ugly black and green blotched tile could show him a way out of all of this. A knock on the door made him look up slowly, his eyes focusing as light flooded the dim room. He watched Atley push into the room, stopping right at the opposite side of his mother's bed; his eyes moving over her almost sympathetically before he turned back to him. All compassion and any human emotion drained from Atley's face as he nodded to him; the very sight making Memphis shudder involuntarily. Atley had always been a cold bastard but to watch the man's face go from expressive to stone in under a second was still unnerving-almost as much as when he'd seen it for the first time all of those years ago. He motioned his head to the hall, his voice cold and almost dead as he spoke; reaffirming that something pretty bad had happened. Atley rarely went Antifreeze on them these days-no need since they were all pretty much retired- and it was almost terrifying to see it now. He pushed to his feet, casting one last glance at his mother before he followed Jackson into the hallway. The man moved to one of the smaller sitting areas, sinking into the uncomfortable couch before he kicked his feet onto the coffee table and pulled his cigarettes from his pocket. Memphis blinked as Atley lit up, exhaling a cloud of gray smoke even as one of the nurses stopped and glared at him. Jackson looked to her, leveling a frigid glare on the woman before she bristled and stalked of; muttering as she rounded the corner quickly. Atley waited until she was gone before he snorted and rolled his eyes, looking back to Memphis in exasperation. \"Some fuckin' people Raines. I mean Christ at least I didn't smoke in the room right?\" Memphis gave Atley a hesitant smile before he shrugged, not even bothering to mention the blatant no smoking sign not even a foot above the older boost's head. Or the fact that no one else in their right mind would smoke in such an oxygen rich environment. Then again Atley was many things but no one had ever accused him of being in his right mind. Probably why he was such a good damned boost. He shifted, sinking into the chair across from him as Atley grumbled and smoked. \"What did you need Atley?\" Atley seemed to remember himself, sobering before he sighed and leaned forward; cigarette hanging from his lips. \"Look. I know you're in a bad way with all of this. And I know that no matter what any of us say you're not going to let us give you anything. But I have an idea.\" Memphis looked to him skeptically, brow raised before he nodded slowly for him to continue. He was almost afraid now but at this point he was willing to sell his soul to make sure his mom didn't hurt. He'd watched the nurses dose her before she passed out, screaming and writhing from the pain of the abnormally strong chemotherapy treatment coursing through her veins. If he could spare her any of that he would. \"Go on.\" Atley nodded, leaning even closer as he glanced around. \"I got a call last week from the Cacuzza familia. They're apparently taking back everything that Calitri took from them now that the bastard's dead. And they extended a pretty fucking huge offer. If we agree to run for them exclusively- you know not taking anything from the Triads and Russians- then they'll match every other sheet we have to pass. And they offered to hand us a start-up bonus. That will pay for all of this and more . . . I know that none of us would say a fucking thing about you and Kip keeping it.\" Memphis blinked, stunned as Atley hurried to continue. He hadn't even considered going back into boosting. Not after everything that happened . . . but if it could pay for this then maybe he needed to. Even if it went against everything he'd promised his mother he'd never do. \"I know it's not something you want to do but I figured . . . Raines all they want to do is meet and talk . If you don't want to no one's gonna push. They're not strong enough to and they know it. I just wanted to help.\" Memphis nodded, suddenly grateful as he leaned back into the couch. This was a lot of potential money and with the way that they'd all run together the year before . . . this could work. Fuck it, old promises be damned. His mother wasn't going to hurt and they weren't going to lose everything a second time. Not if he could help it. \"Tell 'em to pick a time and I'll meet. And let the others know if they want in, all they have to do is ask.\" Atley nodded, leaning back into the seat with a relieved expression; smoking happily as he tugged his cellphone from his jacket pocket. Right before two rather large orderlies rounded the corner with their sights set solely on his grinning, smoking friend. Atley glanced up, spotting them before he rolled his eyes and groaned; grousing already as Memphis tried not to sputter and laugh. Jackson was the only person he knew who would bitch about being kicked out for disobeying the damn rules. \"Aw for fuck's sakes! Goddamn smoking Nazis! Let me go ya big idiots. I may be a gimp but I can walk out on my own.\"[Chapter 2] No one kill me for how this ends. I swear i t all serves a purpose! Returns & Reprecussions June 2001 Hex grinned as he pulled slowly into the lot of Otto's, trying not to let his passenger see just how funny he thought all of this was. But despite his best efforts the swift cuff to his shoulder and louder grumbles told him that he'd been caught . . . and that Ripley Guadimus was not thrilled that she was the source of his entertainment. Again. He shifted, pulling into a parking spot as a gleaming 69 Corvette slid to a stop beside him; letting both of them see that Frank and San were deep in an argument over something. He rolled his eyes as Ripley snorted, the two sharing a look as they heard the engine of the Vette stop. Frankie and San were more than happy to freely return to Long Beach but the two had almost driven them insane on the long haul back from Miami. Every five seconds it was 'stop here and see this' or 'we have to stop to eat or pee or try and flag down some chick for Frank.' He watched Frankie step out of the car, adjusting his long sleeved black crew necked shirt before he rolled his eyes at San tugging his own tanktop and hoodie to rights. Hex turned to Ripley, watching her roll her eyes again as she grumbled. But even as pissy as she was-and lord she'd gotten worse the closer they'd gotten to the limits for some reason- he had to agree with her. This was getting ridiculous. \"Oh for the love of- seriously? Why do they both look like they just stepped off an Abercrombie ad? They were supposed to be in hiding while Calitri was running crazy not brushing up on how to be casually fashionable. Or fucking nerve racking.\" Hex shrugged, killing the Chevelle's engine as he watched the other two march straight into Otto's like it was seven years before; like they hadn't run out in the middle of the night because a crazy Brit mobster was trying to off Frank for exacting revenge. Or that they'd nearly taken their heads off when he and the girl had first shown up to take them home. He reached out, taking Ripley's hand in his as she glared at the two walking away; her jaw clenching as she let out a shallow breath. He squeezed her hand just as a new set of headlights flooded the lot, the tires of the classic blue 69 Chevelle Malibu screeching as the car almost slammed into them. Ripley clenched her fist beneath his hand, her eyes blazing as Atley Jackson's shocked face popped up in the passenger window . . . with the almost snarling visage of the Sphinx right beside him. Ripley growled, baring her straight white teeth in a snarl of her own as Atley shook himself and rolled his eyes; carefully getting out of the Malibu. Hex reached out, rolling down the window to the Chevelle as Atley dipped to talk; Sphinx hanging back and glaring at Ripley over the two of them as she growled and glared back. Both he and Jackson shared a look before Atley sighed, shaking his head as Hex tried not to roll his eyes again. Ripley and Atley got along well-so well that Hex had often wondered if they might've knocked boots at one point or another- but the girl and Sphinx had never been able to stand one another for long. Sphinx wasn't discrete about letting it be known he didn't think very highly of the girl and Ripley hadn't let the fact that he was a towering 6'3 wall of muscle, menace and sheer fucking madness stop her from standing up for herself. Actually it seemed to make her want to buck up at him at every single turn . . . something that was still mindboggling considering that every single boost he'd come across gave the man a wide berth. Even her beanpole psycho of a brother. And Khail was known to throw down with Char when the two of them got too froggy or pissy. He shook his head, turning to Jackson with an exasperated look. \"Well hell, I thought that was you. When did you two get back?\" He shrugged, squeezing Ripley's hand again as she bristled. He glanced back, almost jumping when he noticed that Sphinx was closer to the car now; his expression a little less feral than it had been. He raised a brow, watching the man glance to them before turning back to the lot; four new cars sliding in almost bumper to bumper. The four of them watched the cars all move to park around back, Atley grumbling and shaking his head as Ripley seemed to forget about the now exasperated looking man. \"What the fuck was up with that ?\" Atley leaned against the door, propping his elbows on the open window as he jerked his chin towards the cars. \" That Buttercup was the Youngbloods. You know Kip's crew. As in the kids that we'll be in charge of babysitting from here on out until we either get shot again or go away for killing one of them.\" Ripley blinked, turning to Atley before she threw her head back and laughed; her blonde curls falling from beneath the worn and faded Halliwell Restoration trucker hat as she chuckled. She squeezed his hand back before slipping free, stepping out of the car and around to throw her arms around Atley's neck. Jackson moved, catching her before he returned the hug; both of them seeming to relax a bit more as soon as they were in contact with the other. Hex rolled his eyes, stepping out of the car before he turned to Sphinx. Who outright ignored him in favor of raising a brow at the other two. \"God you're probably right, Jackson. But I'll gladly go so long as I get to take Frankie out with them.\" He laughed, keeping her close as he turned back to hex; Sphinx staying just out of their reach as they talked. Apparently he was still about as social as a dead cat . . . but at least he seemed to have mellowed some since they'd all gone their separate ways. Hell and he and Ripley weren't taking slices at each other yet so he'd mellowed a lot. \"Christ kid was he that bad? Last I talked to Hex the two of you were supposedly doing better. Hell you were all out to eat and drink and you were laughing with the Fish. What happened between then and now?\" Ripley rolled her eyes, leaning into him with a huff. \"Try turning a three day drive into almost a week and a half because we had to keep stopping every five seconds. It was worse than kids!\" Atley looked to Hex as he nodded, reaching up to run a hand over his short cropped hair as he shrugged. It had been a living hell trying to get them back to California-but nowhere near as bad as what was waiting on them if his gut was right. And it almost always was. He turned, watching Ripley glance back at Sphinx as he snorted. But both of them nearly stroked when he spoke-actually spoke- a deep British timbre that was so not what he'd expected. God no wonder the man hated him . . . he was probably Protestant too knowing his luck. \"You lived, girlie. Stop your bitching.\" Hex watched Ripley blink before she seemed to remember herself, her eyes narrowing as she turned on Atley. She pointed back to Sphinx, content to bitch at Jackson for both of them-something else that apparently hadn't changed over the years. \" Seriously?! He can talk? And he's British?! I thought this asshole casserole was from Long Beach! Why didn't you tell me?\" Atley shrugged unfazed as he gave her a deadpan look. He crossed his arms, watching her point and bitch before he rolled his eyes. \"Oh sure. Like I tell everyone everything I know about you? You know there's still plenty you don't have a clue about. I'll tell you if you'll let me tell him about you. Hell the two of you might actually get along if you knew one another.\" She stilled, her cheeks flushing as she gaped at him. Before she shook herself and stalked away, threatening him as she made her way inside. \"Oh fuck it! Just keep your damn mouth shut Jackson. I'm heading in.\" Atley grinned, shaking his head as Hex laughed. Jackson moved, clapping him on the shoulder as Sphinx grumbled and moved ahead of them; shaking his head as he went. But Atley's words made him laugh, his mood lifting every step they took towards the others. As much as he hated to hear about Raines's mother Atley was right; after being in Miami and near Seal Beach for so long it was damned great to be home. \"It's good to have you home Hex. To have everyone back in the fold . . . just be easy with Memphis. Helen took a turn for the worst last month and she's not looking good.\" Atley watched Cacuzza eye Memphis and Kip skeptically, the blonde mobster looking nothing but bored as the brothers stood just outside of the veranda. They'd been running regular boosts for the man for three months now but-since the initial meet- this was honestly the first time they'd had to actually stay with him. He turned, giving Cacuzza a wry grin just as Paulo rounded the corner with Ripley and Sway in tow; the taller blonde giving the enforcer a hesitant look while Ripley just glared at up him. Paulo extended his hand, allowing the girls to move in front of him as Sway sighed and went to comply. Only to yelp and turn on the man as Ripley reached up and slugged him hard. Memphis and Kip both froze, the oldest Raines groaning as the enforcer staggered back from the force of the girl's blow. Atley however just laughed, shaking his head as he took a drink from the bourbon he'd been given; Cacuzza chuckling drily beside him. Paulo was a habitual womanizer-actually the man was damned closer to a dog than even Frankie- and had tried his luck with Wayland. And they all knew the only reason that Sway hadn't gotten to him is because Ripley had sprung she was still a loose cannon. He turned, nodding to Cacuzza as he shook his head; motioning the other two mobsters away from the girls as he called out to them. Memphis and Kip visibly relaxing as the girls were ushered to the table. \"Leave them be. Paulo knew better than to overstep his bounds. Come. Sit. \" Atley shook his head, trying not to grin as Sway sank into the closet seat gratefully. Memphis and kip moved to sit beside her as Ripley stayed just to the side, glancing to him skeptically. He grinned, reaching out and patting the seat next to him; watching her slide into it cautiously. Her eyes trained on the mob boss as she reached out and took his hand. He leaned close, squeezing her hand reassuringly as he spoke to her; nudging her playfully as she seemed to relax. She grinned at him tightly, nodding before she turned her eyes to Cacuzza. Something that the mob boss was more than intrigued by as he raised a brow at her. \"Easy Buttercup, we're fine . . . You just need to keep it together.\" Cacuzza sighed, turning to Raines before he casually tossed a thick manila envelope onto the table; nodding to the bulging parcel boredly. He leaned back in the chair, lighting a cigar as he spoke; his voice carrying over the patio as he smoked. \"How's your hand Ms . . .\" Ripley blushed, dipping her chin as she answered; the bill of her hat shadowing her face as she squeezed his hand beneath the table. He sighed, squeezing it back as he tugged her hand into his lap. He knew she was embarrassed over snapping so badly so quickly-hell they'd had more than a few talks about her short temper over the past ten years- but nowhere near as badly as she was over being called out. Ripley had never been comfortable being the center of attention even when she'd been younger. \"Guadimus, Sir. Sorry.\" \"There's no need to worry yourselves. I'm well aware of how forward my enforcer can be. I must admit I'm impressed though. I could hear his jaw crack even over here. Nevertheless I would like to proceed.\" He took a deep pull from the cigar before continuing, leveling a stone hard gaze on Memphis. \"I am more than impressed by how lucrative this has been thus far, Mr. Raines. However I am offering a substantial amount of money for your services-something Jackson was rather insistent upon- so I wanted to make sure we're all on task. You've yet to be handed any truly difficult sheets and I want your word that-should you come upon one with your Eleanor or some equally stubborn mark-you will fulfill your end of our arrangement.\" Memphis nodded, not even glancing at Sway or kip as he answered. But Atley watched him reach out and take Sway's hand, his thumb moving over her knuckles soothingly as he spoke. \"I give you my word sir. My crew and I are more than willing to do what needs to be done.\" Cacuzza nodded, taking another long pull from the cigar before he turned to Atley; his lip tilting just enough to be aggravating. Meaning that he was about to open his mouth and say something infuriating. Atley steeled himself, gripping Ripley's hand beneath the table as he felt her bristle. Damn she was too good at reading him for him to show any reaction like that. \"Well then that's all we needed to discuss. The rest of you are more than free to leave . . . but Jackson we need to have a chat. If I can tear you away from your little friend?\" Ripley glared at Cacuzza before he sighed, nodding to her as he pushed her towards the others. She rolled her eyes, moving to follow Wayland and the Raines. And Atley wasn't the only one who noticed the way she glared at the hulking enforcer that held the gate for them to go back towards the parking lots. Cacuzza chuckled as the group disappeared around the corner, shaking his head as he reached out and picked up his neglected glass of wine. He took a long pull before reaching into his coat, pulling out his wallet and dropping three crisp hundred dollar bills onto the linen table cloth; his lips still tugged to the side into a small smirk as he motioned to the money. \"Well that went better than I expected. And before you start, yes you were right. Your girl did spring first.\" Atley rolled his eyes, pocketing the money before taking the fresh bourbon a waiter handed him as he settled in to talk. Not that anyone would ever believe it but he and Cacuzza had been friends for years, the mobster being one of the few people he continuously associated with. They'd kept in touch even after he'd gone to work with Calitri, Cacuzza using his position to keep tabs on the wayward Brit while the familia had tried to find a way to take him out. And he knew for fact that he was one of the only people who had ever seen Luka Cacuzza seven sheets to the wind. Which- with the way he was being to knock back glass after glass as they talked -wasn't too far away in their future. Sway looked down at the plastic strip in her hands, trying her hardest to comprehend what was happening. She knew that she'd been sick for almost three weeks, barely able to keep anything down in the morning and later in the evening. Just like she'd noticed how light headed she was when she stood up too quickly or had to turn suddenly. At first she'd thought that she was just overdoing it with everything that had been going on but when Ripley and Hex had to pick her up out of the floor she'd known something was wrong. She'd tried to tell them that everything was fine-spouting off the same thoughts about fatigue and a possible stomach bug-to try and quell the sheer panic she'd seen rising in Ripley. She knew that the girl was overly paranoid about people getting sick- and with the way her mother had been literally eaten alive with cancer for almost seven years before she'd finally passed she couldn't blame her- but it still didn't make watching her start to freak out before Hex had managed to calm her down any easier to witness. Hex had gathered her up, tugging her to him as he'd talked to her; even mentioned jokingly that she was probably just pregnant. Which had jolted her onto the path that led her here. Sitting on the floor of her bathroom alone with a pregnancy test in hand, nearly chewing her bottom lip off. Oh of course she'd sworn to them that she wasn't, laughing and promising that she was fine again. But she'd made sure to go out as soon as Memphis had left to go sit with Helen and purchase the stick glaring back at her. She knew it was a chicken shit way to go about it but she knew what would happen if either of the Raines brothers had waited with her. Just like she'd known that both the fiery blonde and crazed Irishman were serious in their communal threat: if she didn't find out what was wrong before they saw her next they would drag her to the docs kicking and screaming. She blinked, trying to stop her hands from shaking. She was pregnant . . . and her world was trying to shift in on itself. Why now? She and Memphis had barely been back together a year, the remnants of their crew running alongside Kip's to fill the growing orders for Cacuzza . . . and life had been good. Almost great. She had her family back and she had Memphis. And even with everything going on with Helen-who had been put in the hospice ward at the hospital the month before- her life was almost perfect now. What time she wasn't at the garage, the bar or boosting she was either with Memphis and Kip or with Helen. Her life was supposed to settle now not fucking implode. She shifted the stick in her hands, looking down at the two happy pink lines staring back at her through the tiny window. She blinked again, the realization of what had happened finally settling in. Dear God she was pregnant. She was going to have a baby . Memphis's baby! Her hands went to her stomach, her long fingers tracing the slight swell as a soft smile spread over her lips. So she was twenty five and pregnant . . . there were worse things she could be. She pushed to her feet, moving into the main portion of her apartment slowly. Now all she had to do was tell Memphis. Memphis looked over the score sheet, tallying the marks in his head as the others got ready to roll out. This was a small sheet but it was going to be lucrative, an easy ten car set with a $55000 payout. And considering only five of them would be running tonight it meant an easy $7800 for him-after they took out Otto and Atley's shares of course. He grinned, turning to watch Kip and Tumbler bicker over who was going out with whom. They were still arguing over who was going to be forced to ride out with the Sphinx . . . and who got the privilege of going out with Ripley. He shook his head, biting his lip as he heard Tumbler declare he should get to ride with the girl because he was older while Kip just rolled his eyes and snorted. They'd always bickered over the stupidest things . . . and Tumbler had always tried to use the fact he was a whole two years older than Kip as some great trump card. God it was just like watching them bitch over toys in their driveway when they were kids. Memphis chuckled, turning back as he watched an unexpected face peer in through the open bay doors; familiar green eyes locking on him as she stepped in. He pushed his hands into the pockets of his leather jacket, grinning warmly to Sway as she moved closer to him. He wasn't about to tell either one of them that he was sending Ripley and Sphinx out together-or that they were going to have to share a tiny civic for the initial ride to their scores. It would be more fun to watch that fiasco unfold when the others got here. Sway smiled up at him, tugging her coat closer as she made her way to him. He would never tell her but he was glad that she'd started dressing more the way she had before, trading her baggier wardrobe for better fitting clothes. Tonight she had on her favorite jeans and a soft snug white tee shirt under the well-worn Ferrari track jacket Ripley and Hex had brought her back from Miami and white turf shoes firmly in place. But even as he smiled back to her he couldn't believe it. She'd taken him back last year, forgiving his stupidity and welcoming him into her life again. And even though he woke up to her every day he still wondered if it was real. If he was going to jolt awake back up north and be alone, exiled from her smiles and touches and kisses. She stopped in front of him, reaching out and taking his hand in hers. She looped her fingers through his, her short clipped nails and rings gleaming in the light. He tightened his hold on her, tugging her into him as he reached out and pushed her hair from her face. \"Hey.\" \"Hey back, Baby.\" Her grin brightened into a full blown smile as she rested her cheek against his chest, looping one of her arms around his waist. A sound made both of them turn in time to see Ripley pushed into the paint dock; followed pretty closely by the Sphinx. Ripley was dressed differently than she normally did, dark painted on jeans and a low cut black long sleeved shirt hugging her curves as she moved quickly away from the other runner. Sphinx was dressed pretty normally, his dark tee shirt and jeans topped off by his suspenders; his jacket slung over his shoulder as he reached out with his other hand to nudge the girl on her shoulder blade. Ripley rounded on him, glaring up at him threateningly as she growled. When she turned Memphis could see she actually had on makeup, her eyes rimmed in black and her lips a glowing glossy pink as she spoke to Sphinx; her voice low enough that they couldn't hear her. Sway turned back to Memphis, perplexed. \"What's going on now?\" Memphis shrugged, glancing down to her. \"I've got no clue. But I hope they can keep it together long enough to run. We've got to drop all of this with Cacuzza down at the docks.\" Sway raised a brow, looking back as Ripley growled loudly; throwing her hands in the air before going back to speaking to Sphinx lowly. Sphinx however just looked her over almost bored before he crossed his arms. He spoke to her, Ripley's face flashing as her cheeks flushed before they watched her expression darken. \"I thought Ripley refused to be anywhere near Cacuzza or his people after the last time?\" Memphis shrugged again, watching Sphinx roll his eyes and push past Ripley deeper into the garage; waving the younger boost off. Ripley glared after him, her mouth opening and closing a few times before she tossed her hands in the air again; growling loudly before she shook her head and stalked after him. He glanced down to Sway, brow raised. \"Yeah well this sheet's gonna pay for the rest of Mom's chemo. Rip knows that and said she'd help . . . and that she'd play nice so long as you know who doesn't touch her. I thought you worked tonight?\" Sway blushed, looking up at him through her lashes shyly as she shrugged. \"I-I did but I traded. Is there any way you can get away? I- I have something that I need to tell you.\" He blinked down at her before shaking his head, looking her over carefully. He knew that with everything going on they hadn't really been able to see each other as much as he'd like but she knew there wasn't any way he could do what she was asking. Not and collect their payload tonight instead of sometime in the week . . . or hearing a lot of shit from Atley and Cacuzza. \"No way to do it, Sway. I gotta be there with Atley to collect-Marcello's rules, you know? We can talk when I-\" She moved, grabbing his arms in a firm grip as she looked up at him pleadingly. And something about how panicked she seemed ate away at him before he felt himself start to get aggravated at her words. \" Please Randall. It's important . . . we have to talk.\" He sighed, giving her an exasperated look as he slowly pulled away from her. Sway was rarely prone to melodrama but she would occasionally pull something like this. And while normally he would just sigh and suffer through it or give in, with everything going on he couldn't. She knew how important all of this was-how necessary. \"And we will , Sarah. But not right this second. Mom's hospital bills are eating us alive even with the boosts. Moving her from oncology to hospice was fucking expensive . . . so is this experimental treatment her doctors are trying. I -we can't afford to fuck this up. Or to take the hit me not running would cause. It's going to take every penny from me and Kip to cover it. Besides I can't just leave him to run on his own, you know?\" Sway glared up at him before sighing, shaking her head before she dipped her chin. Her hair fell around her face, shielding her features from him as she gave him a tiny nod. He sighed, reaching out and taking her hand again; tugging her close. \"C'mon Sway . . . I love you. I want to know what's going on but I need to do this first. It's for my family you know?\" She looked up at him and nodded, letting him lean down and peck her cheek. She smiled at him, stepping back just as Ripley pushed back into the room heatedly. He watched the other boost pull her long ponytail over her shoulders under the back of her toboggan, grumbling as she made her way to them. She'd changed clothes, donning her normal torn denim and a baseball Henley shirt, her hoodie knotted around her waist as she adjusted her beanie. \"Oh my God I liked him so much better when he didn't fucking talk! I swear I don't know what his fucking problem is!\" He raised a brow as she griped, looking to Sway as she giggled and reached out; running a finger down Ripley's blush stained cheek. The other girl stopped, looking to Sway with a raised brow before she blushed even darker; grumbling as she waved his girlfriend off much the same way the Sphinx had her. \"Probably didn't like the fact that you were coming in from a hot date and he wasn't. Seriously Ripley, makeup?\" She rolled her eyes, turning to him almost pleadingly as she tugged her hoodie up and over her shoulders; pushing the sleeves up to her elbows before she crossed her arms. \"Oh come off it, Wayland. At least it isn't Hemi Cuda red lipstick and pink panties. Are you ready Raines? I really just want to get this over with.\" Memphis nodded, looking to Sway as Ripley stilled; looking back to his girl with a scrutinizing eye as Sway started to fidget. He watched her tug her jacket closer, narrowing her eyes at the other blonde. \"What Ripley?\" Ripley's brows knit as her eyes roamed over Sway's face, her mouth set in a firm line even as she spoke. \"Are you feeling better? You look different. You do something to your hair?\" Sway nodded, rolling her eyes as he turned to her suspiciously; her hand going to her curls even as she spoke. He narrowed his eyes, taking in Sway before he sighed to himself. Ripley watched over them like a fucking hawk, rarely missing anything that could lead to trouble. But if it had been bad she would've mentioned it before now right? \"Yeah I'm fine spazoid. And what do you mean I look different? \" Ripley shrugged, shifting on her feet. \"No fucking clue but you just look . . . different. But hell its probably just me. I mean I spent almost eight months helping Hex track down Frank and San in Miami. Everything here at home still seems different. Even after being back so long you know?\" Sway laughed, hugging Ripley- something that shocked both of them. Ripley for all of her personality and conning skill was not a touchy feely person-except with Hex and Atley, and maybe the Halliwells if the retired boost and his wife wanted to dole out hugs. But everyone else knew not to just randomly touch her without warning or reason; a lesson Mirror and Tumbler had to bleed to learn in the weeks following her and Hex's return to Long Beach. And Sway rarely did stuff like this with anyone other than Kip-and maybe Toby . . . but her words had even him trying not to laugh. Well that and the expression on Ripley's face. \" Oh! Poor Ripley. Deprived your best friend and had to spend time with Hex!\" Ripley glared, pulling away quickly as he finally gave into the urge to laugh; shaking his head at the two of them as she griped. \"Sphinx is not my best friend. And I'd rather spend a lifetime with Hex than ten seconds with that ass-hat.\" She straightened, turning to him pleadingly as she adjusted her coat. \"C'mon Memphis! Let's go ahead and get this over with.\" He nodded, turning and pressing a kiss to Sway's cheek; giving her a pointed look as he squeezed her hands reassuringly. \"I love you Sway. And we'll talk as soon as I get back ok?\" She nodded kissing him back. But as he went to step away she stopped him, her voice soft and almost gentle. \"I'll be waiting. Please just be careful . . . and don't let mighty mouse beat up anymore mobsters.\" Ripley snorted, moving to go back outside just as Sphinx stepped back in; the two of them glaring hard at one another. Memphis watched the towering boost finally sigh, stepping aside with an exaggerated bow. \"After you, your highness.\" Ripley's shoulders shook as she growled, cuffing him hard in the arm before she marched right past him to Atley. Her voice fading just a little the farther she moved from him. \" Oooh! You smug sonofabitch! Atley, get him or I'm gonna kill him!\" Sway giggled, watching Sphinx smirk as Atley answered the girl; moving to stand between them. Sphinx crossed his arms, looking down to the girl smugly as Ripley glowered and ground her teeth, neither really paying Jackson any attention at all. \"Now damn it Sphinx! Ripley! Stop fighting! Jesus - tap-dancing- Christ! This shit is worse than when you two tried to gut each other! Raines get out before I kill the both of 'em!\" He nodded to Sway, grabbing Kip and Tumbler as he moved to intercept their friends. Shaking his head at the truth to his brother's words. It was almost funny to see how damned human the sinister man was beginning to act these days. \"Damnation. And to think we used to try to get him to talk. So far all he's done is spout philosophical bullshit and pick on her.\" Tumbler nodded, giving his brother a grin and a shrug. \"Yeah but at least he's not picking on us, you know?\" Ripley moved to the side of the beaten and rusted Ford Explorer she and Sphinx were using for the night, trying to keep her mind on the task at hand. But it wasn't working. Because every single time she glanced back up she caught sight of Sway standing just to the side of the bay doors, arms crossed over her stomach as she watched them all get ready to head out. She turned to Sphinx and Atley as they made their way over, Jackson tossing her the keys to the drop car casually as he limped to stop in front of her. She moved closer, crossing her arms as she glanced back to Sway. And every instinct she had screamed that something was off. She was missing something vital, huge . . . and that didn't sit well with her. She made sure to watch everything around her as much as she could, refusing to let anything blindside her the way her mother's sickness or Khail's incarceration had years before. She reached out, nudging Atley as he leaned against the dented and chipped hood of the SUV. He raised a brow, crossing his arms as he looked to her expectantly; Sphinx rolling his eyes as she spoke. She glared at him before turning back to Atley, trying to ignore him completely. \"I think something's up with Sway, Atley. Something seems . . . off. I'm worried.\" Atley glared at Sphinx as he snorted before turning back to her with a patient smile, reaching out and hugging her before he pushed her towards the driver's seat. \"Well whatever it is they'll work it out Buttercup. They always do . . . just don't worry okay? Now you two go on and grab up those cars. And please for the love of God try not to kill one another?\" Ripley nodded, looking to Sphinx as Atley moved away. She crossed her arms, sighing as she shifted on her feet. The towering boost looking to her expectantly as she pulled her bottom lip between her teeth. Finally she rolled her eyes, shifting on her feet again as she glared up at him. \"Well? Your drop or mine first?\" Tumbler watched Kip drive, trying to get away from the cop following them in the gleaming dark blue Charger; the dashboard lights flashing and sirens blaring. Whoever this guy was, he was good . . . and he wasn't pulling any punches. Kip swerved wildly, pulling the 72 Nissan Skyline into the far lane; whipping in between the oncoming cars like they weren't about to get hit. The youngest Raines pushed hard on the accelerator, zipping between two transfer trucks just as one was trying to switch lanes barely making it through the closing space. And Tumbler couldn't help the yelp he let out or the way he flinched when he shot down the exit ramp Kip had apparently seen. He turned to his friend, fumbling with the seatbelt as he yelled. \"Are you out of your Goddamn mind?! We almost hit that Raines! We're trying not to get killed, not to get dead any damn faster! Remember?!\" Kip snorted, shifting gears as he sped down the ramp. And as soon as they were down it he swung into traffic, merging into the fast moving cars shooting through Long Beach like it wasn't anything. But then again he was a Raines so this wasn't anything to him. He shook his head; grabbing the door handle . . . They were going to die. And it was going to be in a spectacular blazing ball of fiery pain and agony. And all because these guys-driving just as damn crazy as Memphis or Kip- wanted to catch them in the act of boosting the damn car. He turned, watching the car close on them in the rearview mirror . . . Christ they were still with them? How hadn't they lost them by now? Kip swung onto the next road, making sure the car went wide. But as soon as the Charger shot around to follow he corrected quickly and tossed the Skyline into reverse, waving to the shocked looking men as he flew back down the road backwards. Tumbler watched the Charger fishtail before straightening, moving to follow them as fast as the heavier car could. But Kip was already dodging the oncoming traffic, maneuvering between the fast paced cars until he was through the intersection. And as soon as they'd cleared the four lanes of traffic, he hit the emergency brake and pulled a J turn; flooring it to get as far ahead of the baffled cops as they could. But as Tumbler looked down to the speedometer he noticed that they were doing well over a hundred. And no matter how good the engine was it would blow if he kept dogging it the way he was . . . He glanced back, seeing that the Charger wasn't behind them anymore before he reached out and shook Kip's shoulder. \"Dude we lost 'em. You can lay off it.\" Kip glanced at him from the corner of his eye before slowing down just enough to not attract attention. But when a familiar set of flashing lights appeared in the rearview he sped up again, whipping in between cars as quickly as he could. Tumbler shifted in the seat, digging out the prepaid cell phone they used for boosting; searching for the fake name they'd programmed Atley's number under. He knew that the older boost was waiting with Otto at the drop tonight but they needed help . . . and Memphis, Sphinx and Ripley weren't an option since they were grabbing up different scores. He hit send, praying that he would answer as Kip navigated through downtown. And when he heard Atley's aggravated voice fill the line he'd never been happier to be cussed at in his entire life. \" I swear to God if whoever this is ain't dying their gonna be when I get hold of 'em.\" \"Atley?! Its Tumbler . . . Dude we ran into trouble! Big time! And we need help like yesterday!\" \" Tumbler . . . what's going on? What do you mean you ran into trouble?\" Tumbler looked over, seeing the Charger pull around the truck behind them and pull up beside their car. The cop driving was huge-as big as the Sphinx if not bigger- with close cut hair and dark tanned skin. And a huge black swirling tattoo peaking beneath his tight fitting black tee shirt. The man turned to him, smirking condescendingly to him as he brought the Charger over into their lane. Kip's quick reaction the only thing that kept them from getting tapped. Tumbler yelped into the phone, moving closer to Kip as the car swung over the line again. \"The crazy COP kind that wants to run us off the road that's what kind! We need someone here like now dude!\" \" Get somewhere you can dump the car. Get out and run. I'm grabbing Donnie and we'll be there soon.\" Tumbler flipped the phone closed, turning to Kip as he glanced to him. \"What am I doing Tumbler? Cause I don't think this car's gonna last much longer. I'm pushing her in the red now.\" Tumbler winced, checking the RPMs and the temperature before shaking his head. They had to get somewhere fast or this was going to be bad. Well . . . it was going to get worse. He looked over, seeing the turn off to go towards the warehouse district when an idea hit him. This was going to suck but it would work. \"Go down towards the docks dude. Atley said to ditch the car . . . but we gotta get away from scary back there.\" Kip nodded, gunning it as he took the turn. And Tumbler prayed that this went well . . . because if it didn't they really might just die. Sphinx shot down the alleyway, narrowly avoiding the car chasing them. But he had to stay in front of the black BMW or they were as good as caught. Literally. He hadn't thought about jumping into the civic with Raines to pick up the last car once he'd dropped his first mark, wanting to get everything done as quickly as possible. Despite the heavy feeling that had been trying to settle since the girl had dropped him at his score. But now-as he turned to look at Raines in the passenger seat- he knew they were in trouble. He growled, whipping the gleaming red and black Alpha Romeo to the side; effectively keeping the BMW from coming up beside them on the driver's side. He had no clue who these fuckers were but they were damned good. Too bad they were messing with the Old School now . . . and not a bunch of kids. He glanced over, checking the distance before he spun the sleek car around; barreling down on the BMW as hard as he could before he popped over to the side and scraped by. He knew he'd just fucked up the paint on the right side but oh well. The things were being crated anyway . . . and it beat not getting her at all. He shot back out and onto the main road, maneuvering between the lanes and back towards the highway as he checked his rearview. The BMW was just now backing out of the alley. If he swooped into a lot or even a complex he could wait them out . . . which is exactly what he planned to do. He glanced to Raines-his unfortunate partner for this particular boost- before he spotted the lights up ahead towards the docks. A light bulb fired off in his head before he made his way down to the literal labyrinth. What better place to hide this damn thing than in the middle of that fucking maze? He'd seen the recent influx of imports and luxury cars that had been around Long Beach Harbor . . . and he knew that even if they saw him the duo wouldn't be able to differentiate between them and the others. Or at least not enough to pick them out as the drivers if they ended up having to dump the car for the time being. It was perfect. He turned, bringing his brights on as he barreled past the BMW; finally catching sight of the driver. He groaned, turning to Memphis as the man ducked down; cursing as he shook his head. This wasn't just any fucking cop tailing them. It was Castlebeck . . . and he seemed pretty fucking determined to take them down. Sphinx growled, pushing through a red light as he tried to pull away from the GRAB detective and towards the Harbor. Getting to the docks with enough time to ditch the car would ensure their freedom. Now he just had to get them there in one piece. Ripley swung wild as she evaded the dark green Jeep, tugging the hood of her jacket closer around her face as she maneuvered around a string of stopped cars. She shot out and into the intersection, whipping past the two parked cop cars and the totaled truck that had caused the stall in traffic; barreling past them as the Jeep kept track with her. She growled, using the hand she'd been shifting with to reach up and jerk her toboggan down closer to her eyebrows; rearranging her hood again as the Jeep came up beside her. She looked up, thankful that the shadow from the hood and hat was keeping her face from clear view as the cop glared over the empty passenger seat and into the 69 Shelby GT350. Whoever he was he was young-around her age, maybe a few years older- with dark hair that was pushed back from his face. His eyes were locked on her face, the hazel green narrowing as he tried to get a good look at her before she pulled the GT hard and almost clipped him. He jerked the wheel, regaining control of the car before he turned his eyes back to the road; bringing his radio to his lips as he swung wide to go around a slow moving Buick that she only missed by centimeters. She glanced back at the road, looking over the area before she took a wild left turn; cutting across three lanes of traffic and nearly colliding with the Jeep as the cop struggled to catch up with her. She floored it, pushing the Mustang's motor as hard as she could before she made another sharp turn. She glanced at the RPM while she was dodging between the oncoming cars. Of course she'd just have to go down a one-way street! And she was pushing this poor car to go over 90 MPH. She glanced back, thankful that the Jeep was beginning to lag. This Mustang wasn't NOS powered like the last Eleanor Memphis had gone for . . . and the engine hadn't been properly cared for from the way it was beginning to gnarl and jerk. If he'd kept it up she would've been in trouble . . . but the question is who was this guy? She'd never seen him before; and something about the way he'd looked so seriously after her made her worry. This wasn't the same bungling cops that they'd all dealt with before or the idiots running GRAB from what Memphis and the others had seen last year. She sighed, moving towards the docks at a slightly slower pace. She just hoped the others were doing better than she was. Sway paced the waiting room of Regional Medical, trying not to fret as she wrung her hands. She'd known the second she'd walked in this damn place that something horrible had happened . . . but she'd never thought it would really have been to Memphis and Sphinx. She ran a hand over her face as a pair of strong arms caught her around the waist, tugging her into a solid chest as she tried to keep her composure. She turned, seeing it was Atley that had her and knew she couldn't start bawling the way she could with Kip or even Tumbler. The good natured grouch just wouldn't be able to handle it . . . especially not with one of the few people who could calm her down being out of commission. She turned, spotting Tumbler and Kip as they stepped back into the room. And she knew from the looks on their faces that they weren't happy about what they'd been told. She sank into Atley a bit further, looking from Kip to Tumbler as he ran a hand over his blonde spikes. He turned, glancing to the others before he motioned for them to take a seat. Which wasn't bolstering her confidence any at all. She sank into the hospital chair, taking Toby's hand as he offered it to her; Kip shifting in his seat as he began talking. Oh God they were going to tell her he was dead. She was pregnant with his child and they'd come out to tell them that they were dead. \"They're gonna be okay Sway . . . but Sphinx isn't going to be able to do much for the next week or so. He got hit pretty bad in the side with a pretty big chunk of debris. I got no clue who or what got hold of them but it wasn't pretty. Memphis only needs a few stitches and their going to let him go for the night. He's gonna need to be watched though.\" She let out a sigh of relief before she reached over and smacked both of them as hard as she could. That was it? They'd been beat up trying to grab the car?! The damn text she'd gotten made it sound like they were going to be DOA! Not the proud new owners of scars and stitches! She ran a hand over her face as they whined, wiping away thankful tears as she groused at them. \"I really need to teach you guys how to break bad news. I thought they were dying by the way you acted.\" She glanced around, leaning in closer before she spoke again. She hated to do this hear but she needed to know. Because as soon as she Memphis in-tow she had to call Helen to let her know what happened. And their stories needed to line up. As far as the matron of the Raines family was concerned neither of her sons had run since their incident last year. And she was going to stay under that impression if she could help it. Too many people knowing what they did could lead to a lot of trouble. For all of them. Not to mention that her already wanning heart didn't need any help breaking. \"What happened out there? I thought this was going to be easy?\" Atley patted her shoulder as Tumbler snorted. But Kip surprisingly gave both of them a look before he motioned her towards the glass entranceway. Meaning he couldn't tell her in the damned hospital. Oh that wasn't good. She stood, leaning into Kip as they made their way outside. And as soon as they were far enough away from anyone else he tugged his cigarettes from his back pocket, extending one to her before he lit up. She took his lighter, taking a long drag from the tobacco before she looked to him. Kip looked haggard and exhausted, his face slightly drawn with deep bags beneath his hazel green eyes. Meaning he'd been up as long if not longer than the others. He sighed, tugging her close as they smoked. And when he started speaking she listened intently. No need for anyone else to hear should they happen upon them. \"They got the score and were taking it down to the docks. But halfway there they have to stop for a light and got ambushed. A fucking cop in a black BMW that hounded them all the way to the point that Sphinx wrecked them to get away. Sphinx managed to get 'em out and away from the score before he called for a bus. The official story is they were taking a stroll and it was a hit and run gone bad. But Memphis told me he recognized the cop . . . apparently our wonderful benefactor made us the prime targets of GRAB. Again. Castlebeck is who was after them.\" She shook her head, cursing as she took another drag of her cigarette. This wasn't good. Not at all . . . but what was even worse is that she was completely terrified. She had no control over what was going on in their lives now . . . and suddenly all of Helen's bitching and whining years before made sense. She didn't want this for Memphis and she was only his lover. But now that she was expecting her own child she could see how this was heartbreaking. She didn't want this for her child . . . but if she stayed here-with him- she knew that they were bound to get caught up in everything even if she stopped boosting forever. Just like she knew that Memphis wouldn't ever stop again. Her lover's loyalty to both Cacuzza and his family ran deep enough that he would never walk away so long as one or the other needed him there. Even for her if she begged him. She looked up to Kip, giving him a watery smile as she listened to him reassure her that everything was fine. She was going to hate herself for the rest of her life but she wasn't subjecting her child-their child to this kind of life. Not if she could help it. And she knew how to prevent it. Memphis pushed into his apartment slowly, tossing his battered and torn leather jacket onto the sofa as he made his way towards the kitchen. He moved, trying to pop his sore shoulder as he reached into the fridge and liberated a beer; popping the cap on the counter and draining over half the bottle in one swig. God what a night . . . He sighed, leaning against the counter as he held the cool glass bottle to his forehead; trying to will the throbbing pain away as he closed his eyes. He had no idea what had changed within the GTA unit over the past year but it was major. And Castlebeck seemed to be at the forefront of the 'capture the boosts' movement. From what Kip and Tumbler told him- in between their bickering and bitching over barely keeping their score- one of the newer cops with the squad was huge . . . and apparently drove a damned Charger that had almost eaten them alive. The guy hadn't seemed too concerned with anything other than catching them with their mark; hounding them until they'd almost run him into a pylon when Kip had literally drifted through one of the complexes down town. While Ripley had described an officer that sounded frighteningly familiar to Castlebeck's bumbling partner Drycoff. But if that was true then the guy had upped his game, right along with Roland. He grunted as he pushed away from the counter, shaking his head as he moved down the hallway to go towards his bedroom. God all he wanted to do was crawl in bed with Sway, curl up and listen to what she'd wanted to talk to him about before going to sleep for a year. He still thought it was odd that Sway hadn't stayed to take him home from the hospital-especially given that Ripley of all people had volunteered to stay with Sphinx so the rest of them could work tomorrow- but he knew she'd been tired. He pushed open the door, raising a brow as he noticed that the bed was rumpled but otherwise empty. He shrugged, going into the bathroom when he noticed the same thing from before. Things were moved and some of his stuff had been pulled out of the drawers and from beneath the sink but there was no sign of his girlfriend. Or, now that he took a closer look any of her things. He moved back into the bedroom, noticing that the closet was open and most of Sway's clothes were gone . . . and that when he turned to look back over the room there was a note on the bedside table. He bent, picking it up before he dropped it; flinching like the paper and ink had burned him. He blinked, running a hand over his face before he shook his head; sinking onto the edge of the bed slowly. This wasn't happening . . . there was no way that this was right. Not Sway. She wouldn't ever just pick up and abandon him. Not after he'd come back to her and their lives were settling. He glanced back to the note, his hands going to the cell phone in his pocket as his shaking fingers dialed the only number he could think to call. He knew it was late but there wasn't anyone else who would know what to do. \"Mom? I'm sorry to call so late but-Sway's gone Momma. She's just . . . gone.\"[Chapter 3] Shocks June 2001 Ripley rolled her eyes as she moved through Otto's office, trying to file things away as she fought to answer the phone with the armful of papers. God it was days like this that she wondered why she even bothered coming in here anymore. She knew that every single time she did she got put to work . . . and Frankie still didn't seem to understand that the color-coded filing system wasn't just for decoration. She huffed, grabbing the old phone from the cradle as she turned to the sound of the door opening; trying not to outright glare as the Sphinx pushed inside. She narrowed her eyes at him as he moved and sank into the green leather chair, leaning back into the seat as he sighed heavily. She rolled her eyes, answering into the phone as pleasantly as she could. She knew that Sphinx was still sore from the gash in his side and the stitches but seriously why was he here? Shouldn't he be at home? You know the place that he'd outright refused to let her take him, forcing Atley to drive him wherever he lived. \"Halliwell Restoration. How can I help you?\" \" I need to speak to Otto, Ripley. Now.\" She blinked, looking to the phone before she shook herself. She moved, kicking Sphinx's knee before she jerked her chin towards the door. He raised a brow at her, his body language screaming just how tired he was as he looked up at her wearily. She bit her lip, something in her chest rolling at seeing him seem so downtrodden before she shook herself, answering the voice over the phone and him in one go. \"Okay Kip. Hold on. Sphinx is about to go get him. What's going on kid?\" Sphinx stood, coming to stand beside her as he looked to her questioningly. He nodded to the phone, brows knit as she shrugged at him. She covered the phone, sighing in exasperation as she dropped the files onto the cluttered desk. \"I've got no clue. Would you just see if Otto's still here? Please?\" He sighed, nodding as he went to walk away; only to stagger on his feet. She moved, hitting the speaker button on the phone and setting the receiver on the desk as she rushed forward to catch him. She slung his arm over her shoulder, helping get him back to the chair even as she felt her back and side start to burn. She hissed, dropping him into the seat; cussing when she saw that his side was starting to stain dark red. She moved, holding pressure to his side as she chided him; only halfway listening to Kip ramble over the line. \"Oh you big idiot. Why didn't you stay home? You have to know this is bad right?\" He snorted, rolling his eyes before he glanced up at her; his eyes moving over her face briefly before they locked on the phone behind them. He dipped his chin towards the phone, shrugging his brows. She turned, barely catching the rest of what Kip was saying. \" -and we've got no fucking clue why. I'm just hoping she said something to Otto.\" Ripley looked to the phone before turning back to Sphinx, nearly jumping out of her skin when she realized how close to her he was. She looked him over, her breath hitching before she could stop it as he jerked his head back towards the phone. \"What's he goin on 'bout girlie?\" She shook herself, turning back to the phone as her cheeks flushed. \"What Kip? I'm sorry my mind just short circuited. Who do you hope said something to Otto about what?\" \" Sway, Ripley. Sway's gone. Just packed her shit and left . . . She left a note for Memphis but it doesn't make any sense! Like I said, I'm hoping she said something to Otto before she lit out. I mean, they're close you know? I would hope she wouldn't just leave without saying anything to him and Junie.\" Ripley looked to Sphinx, his hand on her shoulders the only thing keeping her upright. She looked up to him, nodding shakily as he kept her steady; her hand on his side quivering as what Kip was saying sunk in. Sway was gone, had just picked up and left them. Oh God Memphis must be devastated. Sphinx shifted, tugging her sit in his lap as she reached up and pushed her hair out of her face; shaking her head as she tried to piece everything together. She couldn't believe this . . . but Kip wouldn't lie about this. \"When-when did she leave Kip?\" \" While we were all at the hospital. Memphis called Mom then called me, falling to pieces the whole damn time. Look, is Otto there? Cause I'm gonna need help getting him outta that apartment. The guys and I want him to stay with us. Being in that place until she comes back isn't going to do him any good.\" She moved, pushing away from Sphinx to go check for Otto. She was pretty sure he'd already gone home but she would double check. She turned back to the line, nodding to Sphinx with a pointed look as she spoke. \"Yeah, I'm going to look now. Talk to Sphinx.\" Kip snorted, making Sphinx glare at the phone as she bit her lip. Any other day it would be hilarious to see him glaring at the desk. But tonight-after everything that had happened it was just another weird thing to add to an already weird day. She sighed, shaking her head as the two grumbled at one another. \" Oh sure, talk to Sphinx. The guy who doesn't talk. Great idea Ripley.\" \"Stop whining boy-o. She's goin ta get Halliwell now.\" Like I said, some will be short . . . next one will be the last one for this update guys.[Chapter 4] Okay some people may be mad at me for this but i swear it serves a purpose. Every time we see these characters with kids its after they've gone straight. I wanted to see what it would be like to introduce a kid to the actual boosting lifestyle. Hope you guys like it. No one kill me . . . Addition & Subtraction June 2004 The woman swerved the Fiat Denali to the side, trying to stay as far ahead of the dark gleaming Mercury as she possibly could. But with the narrow roads being crowded by the smaller autoettes there really wasn't much she could do. Not without practically destroying her only means of escape in the process. She jerked the wheel hard as the other car came up beside her, nearly smashing her into a row of mailboxes even with how fast she reacted. Fuck! This guy wasn't giving up! She took a wild left, heading down towards the harbor as fast as she could; weaving in between parked cars and the few people unfortunate enough to be out and walking. God she just hoped that she could lose him and get home to her daughter. Get them packed and get as far from all of this as she could! She still didn't even know how the fuck they found her! She glanced at her rearview, sighing in relief as she noticed that the lights of the Mercury weren't blinding her anymore. But as she went to slow down and circle back, to try and get as much distance between her and this psycho as she could until the next ferry mainland she felt her heart stop. The Mercury pushed forward from a side road, barreling into the side of her car and pushing her past the pedestrian guards and onto the boardwalk. She tried to maneuver the car before she glanced back out her window, realizing in horror that the dark murky waters of the bat were steadily getting closer. And the dark figure in the Mercury just seemed to be pushing his own car harder to get her there even faster. She moved, tugging her seatbelt off before she tried to get the door to open; struggling to get the door to unlock. But just as she heard it click and the locking mechanism start to tumble open she realized she was no longer on the boardwalk. And the last thing she was aware of was that- as her car plummeted into the ocean and the water started pouring in through the vents and the tiny imperfections in the seals of her doors and windows- it sounded an awful lot like she'd just run head first into a solid brick wall. Memphis Raines pushed through the doors of Halliwell Restoration, trying his damnedest not to grind his teeth. He still couldn't believe after almost three fucking years that Castlebeck was still hounding them hard. And that-even with all of the precautions their benefactor took to ensure their safety- there had been more than a few occasions that the son of a bitch had almost gotten them. He sighed, reaching up and pushing his almost shoulder length hair out of his face; grimacing as he felt just how heavy the wavy mess was. He needed to break down and let Ripley call her friend and cut it but he hadn't really put much thought into his appearance since his mother's death two years before. He hadn't needed to. Everyone he saw was a boost, a mechanic or some random customer that was stupid enough to stop and talk with him while he was at his legal occupation. Though these days-with his increasingly sour disposition and sarcastic tendencies- that was a pretty rare occasion. He snorted, nodding to San as the other boost waved and called to him before turning back to the Camaro body he was patching and sanding. According to Kip and Tumbler- his wonderful brother and their insane roommate- the only people who could actually stand to be around him for long periods of time that weren't drunk or boosting were Ripley, San Hex and Atley. And Sphinx of course but he really wasn't dumb enough to spout off at the towering maniac. He wasn't quite as crazy as Ripley just yet. He moved up the stairs, stepping into the main office quickly before he sank behind the least cluttered desk. He dropped his head onto the paper covered surface, not even wincing at the dull pain that accompanied the loud thud his forehead landing made. God he was just ready to go back home and sleep before he had to run tonight. He really didn't even want to be here today . . . Otto had best have a great reason for this. The door opening loudly was followed closely by a very familiar aggravated voice; and a swift cuff to the back of his head as heavy footsteps moved by him. He grunted his response, refusing to lift his head as he listened to Otto gripe. He loved the man like a second father but seriously he needed to lighten up. And what in the hell was he going on about now? \"Oh for God's sake Raines, get up. And for the love of Pete call these idiots back. They've been calling all damn morning.\" He lifted his head, raising a brow at Otto as the man tossed a slew of slips of paper at him. Each one baring the same number and quickly scribbled sentence. Memphis-call Det. Laguerta with Avalon PD back ASAP. \"And this is about what exactly? Why would a cop in Avalon want to talk with me?\" He looked back up, tossing the slips aside as he reached for the shop phone; rolling his eyes while he dialed the number as Otto sank into the other chair. Grumbling the whole time while he cleaned his glasses with a less than pristine shop rag. \"Like I damn know, kid. But I know that he's called twice an hour every hour. And that he seems to sound more frazzled every time I tell him you aren't here.\" Memphis shrugged, listening to the phone ring as Otto continued to grouse and shift in his seat. But when a voice finally answered he sat a little straighter, leaning over the desk as the officer spoke. \" Laguerta.\" \"Huh Detective? This is Randal Raines returning your call.\" He stiffened before blinking, shocked at the relieved sigh the uniform let loose. \" Oh thank you God. Mr. Raines I need you to come to Avalon as soon as possible. We have a few things to talk about . . . and I need your help.\" Memphis looked up at Otto, before responding; trying to wrap his mind around what was going on. He had to go out to Avalon . . . to talk with a cop that actually sounded happy to hear from him. Okay hell had frozen beneath his feet. \"Uh, okay. I can-uh I can be there in about two hours. Is it okay if I bring someone with me?\" \" Oh sure, sure. Bring whoever you want. Actually I would suggest it. I mean, this might be easier if there's someone else here.\" Atley huffed, settling against the railing of the ferry as Ripley wrapped her arms around herself; looking out to the water despondently. He watched her for a few moments, her honey blonde curls whipping around her face as her eyes stayed on the waves. But he knew from the faraway look on her face that she wasn't really looking at the ocean. Her mind was a million miles away, probably focusing on whatever fight she and her mystery on-and-off again boyfriend had been into. He sighed, reaching out and tugging her into his side; looking up to keep an eye on Memphis and Otto as they talked a little further away. He had no clue why he was being drug out here in the middle of the damn ocean with Raines and Halliwell but he knew Ripley had needed the distraction. And by God he wanted to give it to her. Watching Memphis become cynical and jaded over Sway and his mom had been bad enough but having to couple that with seeing Ripley pretty much fold in on herself over the past year and a half she'd been seeing whatever jackass she was sleeping with was almost more than he could take. Hell he'd almost gotten her and Raines sloppy drunk together and thrown them into a room before Sphinx had stopped him. He rolled his eyes, snorting to himself as he remembered just how aggravated the stoic idiot had gotten with him. He knew that it wasn't his best idea but damn it he was tired of watching the two of them hurt. And he knew for fact that Memphis was better for her than whoever kept jerking her around. He glanced back at her, watching her push her hair behind her ear as she looked to Memphis and Otto; her eyes still slightly red and puffy from the argument before. The 'so-called boyfriend' had gotten pissed when he'd seen her out to lunch with Hex and Frank, calling her and starting a nasty fight right as she'd walked into the garage to help Otto with the books. He'd walked in just in time to watch her scream into her phone before hurling it across the room; burying her face in her hands before he'd gathered her up and forced her into the car with him to follow Raines to the Harbor. She'd talked to him some as they'd followed, only telling him that the guy was insisting-the same way he apparently had been the entire time they'd been together- they were just casual . . . but he'd flipped shit over seeing her with the other two boosts. And she'd finally flipped back . . . right before she'd tossed her phone against the wall. He shook his head, dipping to press a kiss to her temple as she leaned heavier into him; resting her cheek against his shoulder as she sighed. Who in their right fucking mind would do something like this to her? After everything she'd lived through-had scraped and fought to surpass? Surely if she was so torn up about all of it then the bastard had to know more about her than the rest of their crew . . . right? \"Any idea why we're headed to Santa Catalina?\" Her voice broke him from his thoughts, bringing his eyes down to her as she watched Memphis and Otto. The two were leaned against the railing, Memphis smoking while Otto rolled his eyes and smacked him; taking the cigarette from him as his own before Raines lit a new one. Atley rolled his eyes, shrugging as Ripley huffed. \"Oh Junie would kick his ass if she knew he was even holding that cigarette. Stupid old fool; putting his life on the line because of Memphis.\" He grinned, nudging her as he chuckled. Ripley had known the Halliwells most of her life-like her brother before her. The couple had tried to help the siblings years before their mother had even passed but the stubborn brats hadn't let them do more than throw them an extra sheet when they needed the income. After Mikhail was burned Ripley had continued the trend; refusing to take charity of any form while she'd nearly killed herself finishing school and working before she'd resigned herself to caring for her mother alone. The two had barely stayed afloat with their mother's bills and expenses-even with both of them working legit jobs and boosting. But when Khail had been ratted out-by some angry family member of one of his closest runners no less-things had become nearly impossible. The experience had left her cynical and damn near jaded; very few things reminding him of the sweet kid he'd stumbled upon nearly twelve years before. \"Not a damn clue, Buttercup. Just that Memphis had to come and it was important. And Otto's always been crazy just like your damn brother . . . but you knew that. Speaking of which you heard from Khail recently?\" She shook her head, glancing up at him through her lashes. It was something he'd seen her do a million times, checking around them before she asked a sensitive question. Her paranoia was almost worse than his-but with how everything had gone down with her brother he couldn't rightly blame her. Not when it saved both of their asses far more than it hadn't. \"Nah . . . but I don't expect to for a few more days. He usually calls me once a month, maybe twice if something's going on you know? Why? Want me to pass a message?\" Atley shook his head, looking back up as the ferry approached the marina; the boat slowing to dock as Memphis and Otto pushed away from the railing. He sighed, pushing away in time with Ripley; keeping his arm over her shoulders as they moved to follow their friends. \"Nah Buttercup. Just curious to see if you'd heard anything. I mean he's only got two more years-and he's eligible for parole in a few months. Hell, it'd be nice if he actually got out early. Especially with Char being sprung last year. You ready to get this over with?\" She nodded, reaching up and pushing his hair back flat as a gust of strong wind push around them; her eyes shining as she laughed at him fighting to keep his hair in place. But he wasn't angry at her picking-or with the way she reached up and ruffled the same spot he'd just smoothed pack into place. All he could think was that it was damn good to actually see her laugh and smile again; to see her actually happy if only for a few seconds. It was something that the past three years-between Sway, Helen and the GRAB squad's almost constant pursuit- had made pretty scarce for all of them. Memphis blinked as Laguerta handed him the personal belongings bag, handing him the keys to the Fiat Denali that they'd pulled from the bay. And the keys to the small house he was now the sole inheritor of. But what he didn't understand was why. He had no fucking clue who this woman had been-because he knew enough from his mother to know his father's only surviving relative had been a younger brother that had passed away while he'd been in exile- but he was her emergency contact. He shifted the keys in his hands, pulling the bag into his lap as Laguerta moved to answer his phone. He glanced down to the bag, the silver ring on top catching his eye. It looked familiar but he couldn't place it. He shifted in his seat, eying the ring for a few moments before he sighed; shaking himself even as dread started to wind around his gut. It was just a simple ring-there were probably millions just like it. He looked back up as Laguerta spoke, something about what the man said catching his undivided attention. \"Okay. No he's here now . . . go ahead and send her in. Yeah-no bring whatever she needs. I just gave him the keys. Okay James, thanks.\" Raines brows knit on their own, the feeling of dread tripling as his palms started to sweat. Who were they sending in? Laguerta turned to him, hanging up as he sighed. The cop ran his hand down his face, the dark scruffy beard scraping audibly against his hand as he shook his head. \"Well. They're bringing in the rest of the stuff and-after you sign the rest of the forms- you're good to go. I'll have a uniform show you the way to the house to start settling everything. And if we find anything else you'll be the first to-\" Memphis shook his head, more than slightly confused. The second he'd gotten inside the cops had ushered him straight into this office. Only to have this man Laguerta inform him that some woman-an Esther Raines- had been involved in some sort of accident. She'd apparently been pushed off of the boardwalk and into the bay, only her car being recovered in pretty shitty shape from the crime scene photos he'd seen. But none of this made any sense! \"Uh, first to know about what? Because I have to tell you Detective, until you called me I didn't even know this woman existed. Hell I don't know what she even looks- looked like. And why do I have to sign forms? Is it for claiming her effects?\" Laguerta blinked, bringing his hands to rest palm down on the desk as he looked him over in shock. Finally he shook himself and spoke; his voice disbelieving as he started shuffling things around the desk. He seemed to be looking for something but what? Oh God please don't let it be an arrest warrant. \"Wait- what? You don't-but that's not. Wait, wait. Here . . . this was Ester Raines. And until we find a body-or a witness comes forward and tells us otherwise- she's missing presumed dead.\" He handed him a glossy black and white picture, the photo almost slipping from his hands as he saw who it was. He moved, taking the picture in both hands as he looked over the very familiar face in ink. And suddenly he knew why the ring from before had caught his eye; why his gut had started rolling and folding even when he'd been clueless. His mother had given her this ring a few months before she'd left, telling her that it had been passed through their family from mother to daughter or daughter-in-law for over a hundred and fifty years. He looked up, the shock settling in as Laguerta spoke again. \"Mr. Raines? Are you okay? I thought you said you didn't know Esther-\" \" Sarah . Her-her name was Sarah. Sarah Wayland.\" He looked up, panic and anger washing over him as he realized what he'd learned. Sway had been here the entire time; she hadn't gone far from him and had never bothered to contact him. And now she was missing. Someone had run her off the road . . . into the fucking ocean. Fucking hell Sway was probably dead. \"Do you have any clue who did this? Or why?\" Laguerta shook his head, blinking before he glanced back towards the office door. And to the shadow slowly approaching the frosted glass. \"Not yet Mr. Raines -but I have to tell you. Well the main reason we called you was because there was-well we-\" The door opened slowly, a petite female cop moving inside with a quiet determination. But what made Memphis stop was the fact that she was holding the hand of a very small toddler. He looked at the kid for a second, her thick fringe bangs covering her downturned face as her tiny shoulders shook. He felt his heart clench painfully at how sad she looked before Laguerta spoke again, making his head whip back to the detective. \"Well uh . . . Aw shit . Mr. Raines, from everything we've found and from the birth certificate that the city has on file this is Ester- Sarah's daughter. Pennelope Helen Raines.\" Memphis blinked, his mind shutting down as his heart froze in his chest. But as he turned to look at the tiny little girl she looked up at him. His mother's eerie blue-green eyes looked up at him from a face that was almost completely Sway. Her hair was a wavy chestnut brown with reddish tints-just like his mother and brothers- and she had the same button nose that came from the Danvers side of their family. He looked back at Laguerta, shaking his head as everything finally came together. But the cop didn't seem to notice, jabbering away as he finished tossing things back into the file. This bastard seemed relieved that he was pushing this kid off on him . . . but he hadn't even known about her. Didn't even know if she was really his-despite the resemblance. \"Now uh- I can imagine that all of this is a shock Mr. Raines but as far as everything we've been able to find-including Ms. Raines's living will and testament that was tucked away in her home- you're the legal guardian. If you uh want to do anything different we could give you the number for Child Services. I mean I get that-\" He shook his head, turning back to the little girl as she sniffled again. He had no fucking clue how he was going to do this but he wasn't about to leave this kid in the midst of all of this shit. He might not want any of this-hadn't ever even imagined it really- but he wouldn't make her pay for Sway's mistakes. Or for his . He pushed to his feet before kneeling in front of her, reaching out and pushing her hair back from her face as she snubbed and sniffled. Her eyes were red and puffy and her little cheeks were tear stained and raw from where she'd been rubbing at them. But even with the doubts he had in the back of his mind he knew he wasn't this much of a bastard. At least not with kids. Hell he'd always liked them-had worked with them pretty steadily up North- so why not? She looked up at him, her bottom lip puckered as she struggled to breathe through her snot clogged nose. And as soon as he reached out to wipe away a fresh batch of tears, she grabbed his sleeve in a vice grip. He shushed her, opening his mouth to tell her that everything was okay and he wasn't going to leave her when she turned her head and blew her nose. Right on his sleeve and wrist. And as he felt his eye tick before he took in a deep breath, Memphis Raines realized something crucial. He'd dealt with little boys before . . . but he'd never spent more than two minutes around a little girl. And this one was fucking giggling because he was glaring at the snot running down his arm. Oh he was so fucked. Meet Penn. The biggest terror the world has ever fucking known: a two year old.[Chapter 5] No one kill me. All of this is strictly for fun and boredom. Homes & Heartaches Ripley watched the small township of Avalon pass by the windows of Atley's Cadillac; trying to wrap her head around everything they'd been told. Because seriously at this point her brain was about to implode. Apparently Sway had left pregnant and moved here, giving birth to her-and from everything they'd been shown Memphis's - daughter and staying here. Where she'd worked and lived up until last night. She turned, looking to Atley as he sighed; turning to follow Memphis and Otto as the police car turned down another side road. Atley grumbled, barely getting the Caddie to take the turn without having to back up and try again. She knew that there weren't many full sized cars here on the island but seriously? Couldn't they at least have wider roads? \"Oh for fuck's sake. I hope we're almost there or I'm gonna scream. You ever get in touch with the others?\" She glanced back down at her phone, checking the messages as she nodded. As soon as Memphis had walked out and dropped the bomb of the year on them she'd stepped aside and called the others, leaving voicemails and texts when she couldn't reach a single one of them. So far Frankie and San both sent her something back and Hex had volunteered to come out and help them settle the stuff with the house. \"Yeah. Frank and San said they'd tell Junie and Don . . . but they aren't gonna tell Kip or the others. Frank kinda figured Memphis would need to do that. Hex offered to come help if we need it.\" Atley rolled his eyes, shaking his head as they slowed; waiting for Memphis to pull into the driveway of the tiny bungalow before they followed. He put the car in park, turning to look at her as he pulled his cigarettes from his coat; shaking his head as he lit the cig. He exhaled a long cloud of smoke, closing his eyes as he leaned back into the seat. \"Nah, we should be good. But tell him to stay close if we need him when we get back. You ever get in touch with Sphinx?\" She felt her face fall, her mouth cementing in a hard line as she rolled her eyes and snorted; shaking her head. God why did he have to ask about him? \"No. fucker wouldn't even answer the call. Guess he's still pissy about before.\" Atley raised a brow before sighing, passing her the cigarette as he popped his neck. \"I don't even want to know. You two fight like a damn married couple you know that? Fuck. *Sigh* Do you believe this shit?\" She shook her head, reaching up and tugging her hair back into a bun as she sighed. She really couldn't believe it but she wasn't going to say it out loud. Because no matter how bad all of this was hurting her-finding out that Sway had not only lied to them but had left, taking away Memphis's chance to get to know this little girl before she'd been killed- it wasn't about her. It was all about the two people moving out of Eleanor to go towards the door. \"No, not really. But she looks like Helen and Sway got pushed together and Kip's hair got thrown on her head. I can believe that she's his .\" Atley grumbled, turning to glare at the house like it was responsible for all of this. When the person behind it was pretty much lost in the current. \"I don't doubt that , Buttercup. I just want to know why, you know? I mean shit. Why leave? We would've helped her. I mean, fuck the kid would've gotten to at least see her grandmother. I just don't-I don't know how all of this is gonna play out.\" She watched Memphis hold Pennelope's hand carefully, the little girl practically tugging him towards the door as she kept looking around wildly. Like she was searching for something. And if it weren't for the heartbreaking knowledge that she wasn't going to find what she was looking for Ripley would've laughed. Memphis looked terrified . . . but he kept moving forward and trying to catch the girl when she would falter and stumble. He hadn't even known her a full day and Memphis was already fretting. \"I think he'll be fine . . . Kip too. And you know that the whole crew's gonna help 'em anyway we can. I just worry about how she's gonna handle this, Atley. She's so little. Her whole world's just changed so much; flipped in on itself practically overnight. She lost her mom-the only thing she knew.\" He reached out, taking her hand and squeezing tightly before he sighed; leaving her thankful that he didn't mention the water pooling beneath her lashes or the quiver to her own lips. She always got weepy near the anniversary of her mother's death. Hell it was one of the reasons she generally didn't do much throughout the summers-save surf and work. It gave her the time to mourn without the others seeing her, letting her keep her image as someone not to be trifled with. She knew she didn't really need to keep the big bad bitch act up anymore-not with Calitri gone and most of the other crews dead or imprisoned- but being untouchable had kept her safe when her connections alone couldn't. Even running with Char and Khail or being so close to Atley wasn't always enough to keep the really creepy assholes at bay. Not when she was a little blonde piece of jailbait running around with people nearly ten years her senior. \"Well, we can't fix it but by God we won't let it break her. Okay? Besides, we all know that the second Junie sees her it's over.\" Ripley grinned as all of her melancholy vanished, laughing as she imagined the reaction Otto's wife was going to have to the little girl. Pennelope was petite even for her age, with big expressive eyes and a head full of dark curls. And she was shy and polite and overly girly from everything they'd seen so far. God Junie was going to be in heaven. She looked to Atley, laughing as she reached out to open the door. \"Oh my God, Atley. No one's going to be able to stop her.\" Atley watched Pennelope move through the tiny but tidy living room straight towards the hall, completely ignoring Memphis and Otto calling for her to slow down before she fell. He didn't need to follow her to know what she was doing. She was going to check her mother's room and then her own, to see if the cops had lied to her and her mom was really there. And it broke his black fucking heart to know that she was going to be disappointed. He glanced around the room, the worn and almost ratty furniture-obviously nowhere near new- was pushed against the cracked walls; small framed pictures of the beach and boats strategically placed to cover the worst spots. The rug over the hardwood floors had definitely seen better days. Actually from the looks of the battered kitchen appliances and the broken tiles in the kitchen the whole house fit that description. God how had Sway moved from her own apartment into this? He sighed glancing up as Ripley moved down the narrow hallway slowly, her eyes locking with his as he nodded to her. If anyone knew how to deal with this it would be Ripley . . . at least out of the four of them anyway. Hell he'd been in her first apartment before she'd bought the house, seen what she and her family had squeezed into and lived through. He just hoped that she would be okay until they got back. He looked to Memphis, watching him and Otto move through the living room and kitchen before he turned to go with the girls. He really didn't want to watch Raines fall apart when all of this finally settled on him. It had been hard enough when Sway had just picked up and lit out, but to find out that she'd had his kid and hidden it-pretty much depriving him of being part of her life- before she'd been murdered . . . Randall wasn't going to hold up well. At all. He moved down the hall, not bothering to look in the half closed door as he stepped into the bright pink bedroom to the right. He blinked the almost blinding Pepto-Bismol pink jarring to his senses until he shook his head. God he felt bad for the Raines brothers and Tumbler . . . because this kid was going to wreak havoc in the former manzone that was the Raines household. He turned taking in all of the purple ponies and unicorns, the laughing hippos in tutus and the various sparkled flowers pasted haphazardly around the walls. The twin sized bed was adorned in purple and pink, the colors striping together to make a garish zebra pattern that had tiny glittery crowns scattered over the covers; the pink pillows reading 'Princess' in bold purple . . . and a million stuffed animals nestled against the bright white headboard. With big glittery letters reading PENN arched over the bed on the wall. Dear God this was a fresh new kind of hell. Atley turned, watching Ripley as she sank to crouch in front of the little girl; her hands dangling loosely over her knees as Pennelope pet the head of the battered stuffed rabbit she was holding. Pennelope didn't look up as Ripley spoke, her tiny fingers worrying the almost frayed fur on the bunny as she shrugged. \"Pennelope? What's wrong honey?\" \"I'm gonna hafta move ain't I?\" Ripley seemed to falter for a second before she nodded once, just barely dipping her chin as she reached out and pushed Pennelope's hair out of her face. The little girl looked up at her with big watery eyes, her bottom lip trembling as he watched Ripley literally soften before his eyes. She gathered the girl up, threading her fingers through her hair as Memphis's daughter snuggled into her hold; her shoulders starting to shake as she finally cried. Ripley sank to sit completely on the ground, holding the girl as she rocked her; quietly shushing her as she brushed her fingers through her hair. And Atley saw a side of his friend that he hadn't seen in years. He'd almost forgotten how gentle she'd used to be after all the changes they'd faced . . . but it was good to see that she hadn't lost her sweet side completely. It was just buried deep under all of her ballsy attitude and smart ass ways. \"Its okay honey . . . I know it hurts but it's gonna be okay. Do you believe me?\" She nodded, looking up as Ripley wiped her face; the older girl smiling warmly down to her. \"Alright then. Why don't we go ahead and pick out a few things to take back with us . . . okay, Pennelope?\" Pennelope nodded, rubbing at her eyes as she whispered. \"Okay, Ms. Ripley. Can I take Barnaby?\" Ripley blinked owlishly at the kid, leaning back as the girl held her rabbit up to her face; its almost worn nose touching hers. She tried to lean away as she nodded, ruffling the kid's hair as Atley bit back a chuckle. Apparently Rip had made a friend . . . even if she didn't really want one. He turned back as Ripley answered the girl a little gruffly, her cheeks staining red as Memphis and Otto stepped up behind him. Halliwell smirked, shaking his head while Memphis just watched his daughter and their friend together. \"Yeah kid, sure. Just get it out of my face okay? And it's just Ripley. Got it?\" Pennelope nodded vigorously, wrapping her arms around Ripley's waist as she answered. And when Rip wrapped her arms around the girl and hugged her close Atley began wonder if maybe little Pennelope Raines isn't exactly what they'd needed . . . you know if she didn't turn them all into simpering idiots before she was five. \"Yes ma'am. Can Barnaby help us pack?\" Memphis looked between Otto and Atley, trying not to snap at the toddler that was clinging to Ripley's hand and screaming bloody murder. The same way she'd been screaming for almost fifteen minutes and his nerves were only going to take so much more before he finally lost it. But if he couldn't handle this-the first small temper tantrum- then how was he supposed to deal with this all the time? God he wasn't cut out for this. He blinked, watching Ripley drop to her knees before Penn; reaching out and smoothing her curls as she shushed her. Penn kept looking to her, big tears falling down her red face as snot poured from her nose; her bottom lip trembling as her whole body shook from the force of her sobs. But Ripley didn't seem to mind as she kept running her fingers through her hair, talking calmly to her as the three of them just watched. Little boys didn't do stuff like this, not from the way Otto was looking like a coyote stuck in a trap. And he could tell that the retired boost was about two seconds away from chewing off his own arm to get away. Well figuratively of course. \"Penn, honey we talked about this. Remember? I promised it was going to be okay . . . do you believe me?\" Penn nodded, snubbing pitifully as she rubbed her eyes. But Memphis felt his heart break at what Penn said next, her voice small and broken as she looked at Ripley. God she looked so lost. \"But what if Momma comes back? No one's gonna be here!\" Atley moved behind him, letting Memphis know that the coldest bastard he knew was just as effected by all of this as he was. And Otto looked dangerously close to breaking into his own tears as their friend gathered up his daughter, rubbing her back as the little girl wrapped her arms around her shoulders; her dingy stuffed rabbit still clutched in her hands as she cried. \"The police are gonna look for her okay? And if they find her then I promise we'll come back.\" \"Can-can Barnaby and me ride with you?\" Ripley stiffened before she spoke, Memphis able to see just how uncomfortable she actually was. But then again the kid never had been too fond of being touched. Being pretty much left to fend for herself-or more to the point fend off every wise cracking and Casanova boost dumb enough to touch her hadn't made her a touchy-feely person. \"Will that make you feel better about going?\" Penn nodded, still clinging to her as Ripley pushed to her feet; keeping her close as she moved towards Atley's Cadillac. She glanced back over her shoulder, her hair falling in her face as she nodded to them. \"C'mon Atley. She's gonna ride with us.\" Atley nodded, moving to open the rear passenger side door. But as soon as Ripley went to sit her down on the cool leather Penn yelped; pointing back to the house's garage wildly. All three men froze, looking around to see what was wrong as Ripley winced; nearly dropping the little girl as she hissed. She sat Penn on the seat, reaching up and rubbing her ear as she groused; barely catching herself from cursing in the process. God they were going to have to figure out something to keep everyone from corrupting this kid. Because he doubted her future teachers were going to appreciate it if his daughter cursed like a sailor . . . or a seasoned boost. \"Oh c'mon on kid, don't scream in my fuc- freaking ear. What's wrong?\" \"My seat! We can't leave without my seat!\" Ripley looked at Penn like she was crazy while Atley reached down and touched her shoulder; nodding towards the house. \"Well? What's she talking about?\" Ripley whipped her head around, her eyes boring into Atley incredulously as she leaned into him and growled; careful to keep her voice low. Suddenly all of the bristle and bluster that Ripley usually kept was back, the soft smiles and touches disappearing as her eyes turned cold. Something that told Memphis she wasn't as comfortable with all of this as she looked-just like the rest of them. God if the only woman among them couldn't deal with this then how was he supposed to?! \"Why in the hell are you asking me? What do I look like, the toddler interpreter?\" Atley glared, opening his mouth to speak when Memphis shook his head; going to step between them to try and keep peace. Just as Penn huffed and crossed her arms, stomping her foot against the back of the seat as she pouted. Suddenly all of the tears from before were gone, replaced by a mini version of Sway's irritated look. Well, everything except for his mother's angry eyes. \"I have to have my seat to ride! Momma says so! Even if it's just to the store and back!\" Otto sighed, shaking his head as he stepped up to Penn; dipping to her level even as his knees creaked and cracked in protest. \"What seat, sweetpea? Where does she keep it?\" Penn seemed to calm some, her eyes moving over Otto carefully before she pointed towards the garage again. And Memphis knew from the slight tick to both Ripley and Atley's eyes that the two of them were probably going home to get drunk as soon as they could get away. Hell he was shocked Rip had lasted this long to begin with. \"In the car. Duh .\" Otto closed his eyes and muttered, turning back to Memphis with a pointed look before he let out a long suffering sigh. Because they all knew that the seat-now identified as a carseat- was either at the impound or on the bottom of the bay. \"That seat got lost sweetpea. So for right now we're gonna have to ride without it. But as soon as we get home we'll go pick one out.\" Penn looked from Otto to Ripley, her eyes going from skeptical to wide and hopeful in an instant. Something he'd seen his own brother do enough to know exactly where that particular trait came from. \"Can Ripley ride with me and Barnaby in the back?\" Ripley bit back a groan before she smiled tightly, nodding to the enthusiastic little girl. Who nodded happily before she slid across the bench seat, dragging the ratty rabbit with her as she started chattering away. And Memphis was pretty sure that as soon as they were back in Long Beach the girl was going to pass the kid off to Junie as fast as she could. Too bad he didn't have that option.[Chapter 6] Okay I know this is a little different from how things normally go but I wanted to try it. Might not stick but hey I can say I gave it a shot right? Sorry, when you have nothing to do but look at the walls your brain starts to come up with some crazy shit. Messes Ripley closed her eyes, trying her hardest not to snap at the little girl chattering away as she watched the dryer like a hawk. She knew that all of this was hard on Penn-knew it better than some of the others- but it wasn't making her any more patient. Especially with the damn migraine she was fighting off. Today had been full of shocks, twists and turns; from being told Sway was pretty much MIA to finding out about Penn . . . and all of that coming on the heels of he-who-shall-not-be-named's latest freak out. Over something he did far more than she did. She glanced away from the towering baskets of clean towels and sheets she was steadily folding, watching as Penn reached out to try and open the dryer door. Again. She rolled her eyes, turning back to folding as she spoke; seeing the girl freeze out of the corner of her eye and drop her head guiltily. \"Pennelope, do not open that door. Barnaby isn't dry from his bath yet . . . and you want him to be dry. Right?\" The little girl blushed, nodding as she flopped back down on the old black and white linoleum to wait; picking at the lacey hem of the princess nightgown she'd just had to wear. God to be such a prissy little thing the kid hated having to do anything that pertained to cleaning. She shuddered, tossing a towel on top of the growing folded pile before picking up another one; Penn looking back up to watch her beloved toy roll around the front load dryer. It had been one of the world's worst fights to get said toddler to take a damn bath . . . falling second only to the war that broken out when she'd declared she was going to wash the ratty little rabbit after Penn blew her nose on its ears. She shook her head, taking a deep breath before the phone in her pocket buzzed; making her pull it out to check the newest message. Hex, Frank and San had all been by before to meet Penn; Kip and Tumbler coming in on Memphis's heels as soon as he'd gotten back from telling the Youngbloods. Donnie had sworn he'd be by sometime tomorrow and Junie was literally foaming at the mouth to get her hands on Penn. So it could really only be a few select people texting her back. She clicked the phone, grinding her teeth as she saw who it was. And what they'd had to say. We need to talk. You still with Raines? She glared at the phone before responding, rolling her eyes before she slammed the phone down a little harder than she should've. She hated phones in general but she'd already tossed this one today . . . she needed to chill with it or she was going to have to buy a new cellphone. Again. She went back to folding, so focused on just forgetting the irritating message from before that she nearly shit her heart when a tiny hand tugged on her jeans; a soft question telling her who was trying to get her attention. \"Auntie Ripley? Is Barnaby almost done at the bunny hospital? Cause I'm tired of waitin' . . .\" Ripley raised a brow as she tried to get her heart to stop beating out of her chest, purposefully ignoring the Auntie that had been attached to her name. That had started on the ferry ride back to Long Beach. And if it kept the kid happy then she'd let her call her anything she wanted . . . so long as it wasn't Chaosia. \"Almost honey. He's just got a few more minutes and he'll be good as new.\" Penn yawned widely, nodding as she rubbed at her eyes tiredly; wrapping her arms around her leg as she rested her cheek against her thigh. Ripley stilled, looking down to her before she smiled; reaching down and ruffling her hair softly. Her phone vibrated, making her turn back to the makeshift folding table. She picked it up, opening the message before she sighed; closing her eyes in frustration. God could he not just let this drop? Let me know when you're on your way home. See you there. Penn reached up, tugging on the sweatshirt she'd donned after she'd been soaked bathing her; her tiny fingers curling in the soft fabric. And Ripley decided right then and there that Tumbler wasn't getting his sweatshirt back. Ever. She was taking it as payment for toddler and bunny cleaning services. \"Auntie Ripley?\" She smiled, shoving the phone in her pocket before she scooped Penn up; letting the little girl cuddle against her sleepily. \"Yeah honey?\" \"Why's your hair gots purple?\" Ripley blinked before she shrugged, leaning back against the washer as Kip stepped out and into the laundry room. He stopped when he saw she had the girl, the already opened beer hanging limply from his fingers as he hesitated. She nodded to him, shifting Penn in her hold as the little girl yawned again. Kip moved, leaning against the washer beside her; setting the beer down on the closed lid as he sighed. They stood together in silence for a long time; the only sounds the dull roar of the dryer, the high pitched thrum of the light and Penn's quiet little snores filling the void between them. Finally Kip turned to her, his eyes clouded with unshed tears as reached up and ran a shaky hand through his hair. He shifted on his feet, looking to her unsure of himself as he spoke; his voice barely audible. \"Can-can I hold her?\" Ripley smiled, carefully handing him the little girl right as the dryer beeped; signaling it was entering its last cycle. Penn stirred, lifting her head to look at her sleepily. Her tiny dark brows furrowed before she turned back to look at Kip, her confusion obvious as she started to squirm. \"Auntie Ripley? Is Barnaby better?\" \"Almost. He's only got a few more minutes now. Your Uncle Kip's gonna hold you so I can get him okay?\" Ripley reached out, brushing her hair back from her face as she shushed her; Penn laying her head on Kip's shoulder as she nodded to her. She snuggled into Kip, sighing dreamily before she closed her eyes; her speech already slurring as she drifted back to sleep. \"Okay . . . you're gonna tuck me and Barnaby in right?\" Kip looked up to her, his eyes watery as she spoke to her. And Ripley knew that even with everything that had happened Penn was going to be fine. She'd lost her mom but she'd gained a huge, crazy caring family. One that-despite its dysfunction and issues- wasn't ever going to let her fall or be alone. Now if only she was so sure about the rest of them surviving this intact she might feel okay. Kip watched Penn in Memphis's bed, the toddler spread out and taking up most of his queen sized mattress like it wasn't a great feat as she snored and jabbered in her sleep. He turned back, watching Memphis take another deep pull from the tequila bottle before he passed it to him; Kip not even bothering to argue as his brother spoke. \"After tonight we can't drink in the house anymore . . . and you and Tumbler are gonna have to be discrete if you bring home company. You feel me?\" Kip nodded, turning to watch Penn shift before she settled; the freshly washed rabbit held in vice grip. He still couldn't believe Ripley had gotten the thing away from the terrified two year old long enough to get it washed and dried but she had. And to think all she'd had to do was surrender her sweater until the rabbit had been liberated from the dryer. He smirked, shaking his head as he remembered Penn standing beside Ripley in their laundry room; the lavender blonde folding the baskets of clothes they'd left to collect dust while the little girl had watched her beloved toy roll around in the front load dryer. Every time the ancient thing had signaled it was starting a new cycle Penn had gotten frantic . . . until Ripley had sighed and told her it was just counting down until he was done. At the bunny hairdresser no less. God she deserved major points for thinking up that one. He sighed, looking back as Tumbler moved to join them; easily accepting the bottle before he jerked his chin back towards the biggest bedroom in the house. When their mom had gone into the hospital permanently-and Sway had up and abandoned them all to have Penn- Memphis had moved back in, reclaiming his childhood room while Kip had moved into what had been their father's office. Leaving his old room free for Tumbler to take when they'd finally just told him to move in. But none of them had ever even tried to venture into the late Helen Raines room, neither Memphis nor he able to stomach boxing up her things. And for the last two years they'd left the room closed off, only going in to air it out on Ripley's strict instructions when she forced them to clean. Tumbler spoke, breaking him out of his daze as he handed him the bottle back. \"I got the last of it . . . and Ripley said she'd switch a shift with Rome so she could help me clear the furniture to paint. You still set on letting her pick the color or you going to let the kid?\" Kip watched Memphis cringe, shaking his head as he stole the bottle from him before he ever got another drink. Memphis drained a good slug before he gave it back, still seeming horrified as he spoke. \"Oh God no. Ripley has full reign . . . Christ her room at Sway's was all pink and purple and princess shit. At least if Ripley takes over we'll be able to go in without sunglasses. Hell Atley wouldn't even go all the way in. Atley , Kip. I've seen that man step over dead bodies like it isn't shit.\" Kip grinned, looking to Tumbler before he noticed the decidedly sour expression his friend had taken on. He raised a brow, nudging the slightly taller boost as he rolled his eyes and stole the tequila. Grumbling before he took a deep pull from the communal bottle. \"Oh happy- happy joy- joy . Do you know the chances that you and Sway were gonna make a kid like Penn? A zillion to one odds man. And that's exactly what we got- the prissy primadonna princess that's going to scream and cry until everything's pink and ponies. God this is going to be hell.\" Memphis turned, leveling a dark look on Tumbler as he seemed to realize he'd been bitching out loud; his chin dipping as he ducked his head sheepishly. He reached back, rubbing the back of his neck as he shrugged and gave the two of them an apologetic grin. \"Hey man, no offense. But seriously? What do any of us know about taking care of a little girl? Especially one that's so . . . well girlie. Donnie and San are both divorced, Atley's a freaking psycho- Just like Sphinx and Hex- and Frankie's a single guy like the rest of us. Hell only Otto and Junie have successfully raised a kid in our line of work without committing murder or filing for divorce. How the hell are we supposed to do this? I mean fuck man; even Ripley looked about ready to run screaming before she got the kid to stop crying over the rabbit.\" Memphis rolled his eyes, smacking Tumbler in the back of the head before he settled against the door frame; shaking his head. \"Yeah but she was good with her on the island, Tumbler. Hell, so was Atley once we were away from the pink. And we all know that none of us are going to be able to keep Junie and Otto away. Because regardless of what you might think Otto was whipped the second she looked up and asked if she could call him Grampa Otto .\" He glanced back to his daughter, watching her shift before he turned back to them. And Kip knew from the look in his eye that he'd made up his mind. Regardless of whatever else happened, Penn Raines was here to stay . . . and that was going to mean some major changes for them. Ripley moved through her kitchen, taking a long drink from the rather tall glass of bourbon she'd poured earlier. She knew she didn't need to drink so heavily but damn it after today she'd earned it. She stopped in front of her table, leaning against the closest chair as she closed her eyes. God today just didn't seem like it wanted to end . . . but she knew she still had one last thing to do. A knock at the front door made her turn, her eyes cutting to the teal painted French doors almost despondently before she sighed. Better go ahead and get this over with. She moved, setting the half empty glass down on the table before she opened the door; leaning against the glossy wood almost shyly as she took in the person on the other side. It was still so odd to see him standing there, hands in the pockets of his coat as he waited for her to let him in; all of the normal attitude he kept towards her absent. She stepped back as he nodded to her, stepping inside as he shrugged out of the thick peacoat; folding it and laying it carefully over the back of her dining room chair as she closed the door. She shifted, wrapping her arms around herself as she waited on him to speak. But he never did, just looked her over before shaking his head; reaching out and picking up her abandoned glass. He nodded to her, raising the glass before he took a long drink; nearly draining it before he extended it to her. She reached out, taking the glass and killing it; setting it back on the table with a sigh. Okay apparently he was going to make her get the ball rolling. \"You wanted to talk?\" He gave a deadpan look before he rolled his eyes, crossing his arms as he leaned against her table. Finally after watching her fidget for a few minutes he sighed, looking away from her to run his eyes over her living room and the kitchen as he spoke. \"You just gettin' in?\" She nodded, moving to stand just in front of him; her arms still wrapped around herself as she sighed. \"Yeah it was impossible to get out of there before we got the kid to sleep. Atley fill you in on everything?\" He nodded, glancing back at her skeptically before he gave her a sarcastic smirk. He reached out, tugging her into his chest as she glared up at him; trying to fight the blush spreading over her cheeks. \"Yeah. He also told me 'bout how you apparently made a friend. Auntie. \" She turned from him, trying not to shiver as he ran his hands down her sides lightly; just barely grazing her before his hands settled on her hips. She refused to look at him as she quipped at him, knowing without seeing him that his face was darkening dangerously. He might've been content to act like earlier didn't happen but she wasn't. He'd freaked on her, cursing at her and demanding to know what she'd thought she was doing before she'd finally snapped back. And now that they were in the privacy of her home-the only place they'd ever ended up in the past two years they'd been doing this stupid little dance- she wasn't going to forget the way he'd been fucking with her. \"So are you going to tell me what your fucking deal was earlier or do I get to guess?\" He glared at her, his fingers digging into her hips a little harder before he shrugged; rolling his eyes. But as soon as he spoke she looked up at him like he was insane. Because he fucking was. The man acted like he barely tolerated her in front of the others, usually only speaking just to take some small dig at her or to aggravate Atley. And while she normally understood-because honestly the two of them were never going to be the way she wanted them to be without lacing both of their food with lithium- it made it odd when things like this happened. Every once in a while he'd pop up and do or say something like this to make her think that maybe they were more than just casual. Until they fought and didn't speak again for weeks or months on end. \"Was just odd seeing you out with Frank. He does nothin' but go on and on 'bout how he's gonna get in your pants one day. What with the way the two of you were acting I was beginning to wonder.\" She sighed, going to try to move but he stopped her; tugging her back to him as he moved to sit in the closest chair. He made sure she was straddling his hips as he tugged her into his lap. She shifted, hating that her cheeks were probably the color of her bathroom door as one of his thumbs started tracing lazily circles on her thigh. She hesitated, biting her lip before she shook her head; trying to move away. Praying he didn't call her on her bluff. \"What does it matter either way? We're casual , remember? As in no strings attached, just sex. The way you want it to be. You have your regular flings- what am I really just supposed to sit around until you decide you want to come back?\" He kept her in his lap, tugging her down harder as his other hand came to catch her chin; making her look at him as he ground his teeth. After a few intense moments he tilted her face, pulling it up as his mouth moved over hers lazily; dropping light kisses as he spoke to her. What was with him today? He hardly ever wanted to be touched-just like her on most days- and he wasn't ever this openly affectionate. Not unless something bad had happened. \"I know you have your boyfriends, Girl. And so long as Frank isn't one o' them everything'll be just fine. And he can keep on being a breathing waste o space.\" She furrowed her brows, opening her mouth to speak again before he cut her off; kissing her hard as he pushed to his feet. He moved through her kitchen towards the bedroom, his mouth moving over hers as she melted into him. And as he pushed into her room, dropping her onto the plush soft bed she suddenly had a hard time remembering her issue from before. But something about the way he was handling her, touching her made her still. She caught his face in her hands, looking him over worriedly as she bit her bottom lip. \"Sphinx? Are you okay? You're acting weird. Well, weirder than normal.\" He shrugged his brows, kissing her wrist before he settled over her; nipping at the soft flesh as she shivered. She closed her eyes, trying to fight the warring waves of desire and melancholy. \"I'm fine, Girlie. Just wanted you.\" He always said that, always whispered the same thing to her every time she'd try to ask him about something. And even though it made her heart flip-flop it also made it hurt. Once upon a time hearing him admit to this had been a thrill but now-after almost two years of being primarily with him and forsaking the others he thought she had- she knew it was as much a statement to what would never be as to what was. He wanted her but their- her problems always came when he didn't anymore. She opened her eyes, smiling up at him as brightly as she could; knowing that when he gave her his own little dark grin that he hadn't caught her change in mood. He dipped, catching her lips with his; finally letting her forget about everything else that had happened over the course of the day. For a while at least. Like I said, a little something different from an established fully exclusive relationship . . . I know, I know. The meds are making me loopier than usual. No one plot my death please.[Chapter 7] Thanks to loz and elven-princess ginny for the reviews. And to everyone who sent me PMs over this story. I'm glad people seem to like Penn. And in honor of that-Penn and Paint! Room for Improvement Penn watched with sharp inquisitive eyes as Ripley moved through her new room. The older girl was dressed different than yesterday, her jeans more whole than fabric and a big tee shirt over a white tank-all covered in different colors of paint. She bit her lip as Ripley knelt, balancing on the balls of her bare feet as she pulled the white sheet off of three buckets of paint; glancing back to her with cautious eyes. Penn knew that look-it was the same one her Momma used every time she had to get rid of something she'd outgrown. Or when she was bringing her something new she didn't know if she'd like. Normally she would smile and laugh, saying thank you like she'd been taught (because the one time she hadn't she'd hurt her Momma's feeling so bad she'd cried for hours) but Penn didn't want to do that today. She grimaced as Ripley showed her the paint they'd use to paint her new room, crossing her arms in a huff. She still didn't understand why she'd had to move or who most of these people really were but she was sure she didn't like living here. The house was too big-so much bigger than the tiny bungalow she and her Mom had shared all of her short life-and the room she'd been given was too stuffy. And to make matters worse it smelled like Miss Glenda. Her kindly old neighbor had never been mean or yelled, she'd always had candies and little toys for her whenever she'd see her but Penn had learned early on that the mingling scents of lemons and dust and old people meant that she wouldn't see her Mom for hours-sometimes days if she'd had to leave for work. And this room smelled exactly like that- but worse. It smelled like being away from her Mom forever. Penn hated it! \"I want to paint it pink! My real room is pink !\" Ripley just looked to her before shaking her head, pulling a knife from her pocket; the blade whooshing as she flicked it open with a simple jerk of her wrist. Penn flinched, watching as the purple haired woman carefully slid the blade beneath the lid of the paint can, pealing it up slowly to reveal a very light shade of purple. Penn bit her bottom lip, her brow crinkling as she fought the urge to ooh at the color. It was the exact same color as the inside of Barnaby's ears . . . and she loved it. But she still wanted pink! Ripley however seemed to read her mind, moving to the next can of paint and opening it the same as she had the other. And Penn didn't even try to fight the squeal at the dusky ballet pink her newly acquired aunt revealed. The pink was perfect! It wasn't bright like her old room but it was pretty . . . and it matched Barnaby's nose! Penn looked up, almost jittering as she grinned; reaching for the cans as Ripley eased the last one open. It was just white but it was pretty against the other two colors. \"Want to see the neatest part kiddo?\" Penn looked up eyes locking with Ripley before she nodded; her eyes training down to the colors as the girl moved the purple and pink paint lids. At first nothing happened but the second light from the open window caught the paint the most awesome thing Penn had ever seen happened! The purple glittered to be almost blue and the pink turned almost purple! And they sparkled just like the letters and crown over her old bed! Her eyes shot back up to Ripley as she chuckled, extending the lid to her as she dipped her finger in the paint; drawing lazy circles in the thick liquid as she laughed. Penn watched her for a minute, taking in all of the different pictures on her skin and the light purple hair; her bright eyes and the warm smile. And Penn couldn't help smiling back. So this wasn't her real room . . . but Ripley would help her make it a good one until the complice men found her Momma and she could go home. Maybe she'd even draw pictures on the walls like the ones on her arm and shoulder! Ripley grinned, nodding to the wall with the big window seat; pointing to the molding covered bench settled in the alcove. Penn looked over, eyes going wide as she started explaining what they-her, Junie Paul and Hex- would be doing for most of the day. And Ripley found that she wasn't above admitting to herself that she was pretty damn close to doomed. The kid was nerve wracking and spoiled but she was also sweet . . . and it hadn't been too very long ago that she'd felt the same damn way about Kip Raines. And now they were around one another more often than they weren't. \"See that seat over there? Well we're going to pant the bottom the white and then the wall around it is going to be striped with the pink and purple. Now the rest of the room is going to be purple but this way you get your pink. And Uncle Atley won't have a heart attack if he has to come in okay?\" Penn turned to her, tiny brows drawn in concentration as her bottom lip puckered. She glanced back to the bay window seat before she looked to her; petite fingers reaching out to trace the swirling looping filigree and skull tattoo winding around her left wrist tentatively. She'd gotten the tat from Charm when her brother had been incarcerated; the decorative black and grey filigree wrapping around the two skulls while an antique revolver was nestled between the two. Her father and her brother's prison serial numbers were tucked away neatly in the skulls while the banner around both skulls proudly proclaimed 'serve no master'. It had been one of those pieces that she hadn't even thought about; she'd just sketched it and done it, the needle permanently sealing it beneath her skin before she'd ever really considered anything else. It was too personal and cherished for her to replicate it . . . . and she knew Memphis would have a problem with his soon-to-be-three year old having pink skulls on her walls. Penn's light blue eyes locked with hers, hopeful and wide as her voice started to drop; like a childish imitation of Sway shyly asking for something. But while the kid's request shocked her Ripley knew she didn't really have the heart to say no. Not to that look and the now trembling bottom lip. Christ this kid was an emotional terrorist . . . and they were all fucking doomed. \"Can you draw me some pictures like these? Instead of stripes? I like swirls . . . and maybe I could draw some flowers-\" Ripley shook her head, Penn's face falling as she opened her mouth to speak. And the boost felt like an ass saying no as the little girl's eyes started to water, her mind scrambling to come up with an acceptable compromise. Memphis was for all intents and purposes a new single parent-one with a very private dangerous secret life that kept them at odds with both the other criminal elements of their city and the police. She couldn't do anything too outlandish just in case Castlebeck came calling. \"No-hey now wait! Don't freak out just yet! This here-\" she pointed to the skulls and the gun, keeping her voice soft and warm. \"This is for my family. But I can make you something that's just for you okay? It'll just take a little while. Is that okay?\" Penn snubbed, nodding as she smiled brightly as her tears started to subside; Ripley breathing a sigh of relief as she nodded to her. \"Really! Can I pick the flowers? I still want the swirls-we can do swirls right? Oooh! And crowns and ponies and princesses!\" Ripley looked to the kid, her left eye already starting to tick; all of her warm fuzzy feelings fleeing at the mention of ponies and princesses. Christ Tumbler was right-the odds of Memphis and Sway making a kid like this were so minute no one ever even considered it. And yet here she stood-absolutely determined to make this room as damned terrifying as the one she'd left in Avalon. \"We'll see. First we have to get the purple up.\" Memphis walked into the back bedroom of his house, blinking at the pale purple walls. Ripley had told him she'd picked colors that would-hopefully-grow with Penn. Meaning that they wouldn't be repainting every five seconds the way that Junie had sworn they would if they'd even contemplated the bright pink the kid kept baying for. Honestly he'd expected white or some kind of beige but not purple . . . and was it seriously shimmering? He stepped further into the room taking in the clean hardwood floors, freshly painted trim and baseboards and the old seat at the window. Ripley had called in Paul when she'd seen the seat the night before, having the crazy idiot scrape together enough down and upholstery foam to replace the old worn cushion. He didn't know where the whacko had found it on such short notice but he had, crowning the now clean seat with a new cushion-complete with a dark dusky purple cover and white, pink and black pillows to act as a back. Barnaby was settled in the midst of the pillows, a fresh bow tied around his neck as the ratty little rabbit slumped against his new home. Memphis shook his head, smirking as he took in the shimmering pink swirls framing the window; the dainty roses and chrysanthemums littered through the very tattoo styled filigree making the room seem less girly. The whole thing looked like it belonged on a biker's arm-not a toddler's wall . . . but Penn loved it. Had gone on and on about how she had a whole wall of Ripley's pictures just for her after Hex had shown her the Irish Rose and Crucifix Ripley had done on his right forearm. Christ how had the four of them gotten this done in a day? \"Memphis?\" He jumped, turning to see Ripley in the doorway; leaning against the door jamb as she looked to him cautiously. Her hair was pilled ontop of her head in this lavender blonde rat's nest, stray curls falling around her neck and face; her tee shirt and torn jeans covered in purple pink white and black splotches. He motioned her in, tossing his arm over her shoulders as she came to stand just beside him. The girl flinched, her shoulders stiff before she relaxed; letting Memphis know that for all of the hanging and grabbing she'd let Penn get away with the runner still wasn't happy being manhandled. \"Hey Rip. Thank you for this. When did you get done?\" She sighed, sagging into him as her eyes moved over the room. He watched her, noticing for the first time that Atley had been right. The past three years had been hard on all of them but Ripley had started to become quiet in the past year and half. She'd never been one to bounce around in a hyper rush like Sway and Hex or the Youngbloods but she'd always been moving and loud. The kid had carved a name for herself by never letting anyone push her around, by always speaking her mind and being ready to throw down and dirty in a second's notice. But as she spoke now-her eyes never staying on him for more than a few seconds-he could see that something had happened to make her start to fold. And he hadn't even noticed it . . . no one had but Atley. But then again Atley noticed everything . \"About an hour ago. Hex and Junie helped me paint while Paul ran around and grabbed everything we needed. The walls should be dry enough tomorrow to start moving furniture in. Are you going to move her stuff from Sway's or do I need to tell Paul to hit the thrift stores and consignments? Tomorrow's Saturday so I could even drive up to the flea market in San Jose-see what they've got to offer. It won't be brand new but it'll be sturdy. We can even paint it if we have to.\" Memphis nodded, tugging her closer; fingers tightening enough to squeeze her arm before he eased up. She looked up to him, giving him a careful smile before it fell; her shoulders stiffening as her back went straight as they heard the door open and slam shut at the front of the house. He raised a brow at her as she glanced towards the door as heavy footfalls started towards them; only to still and turn back towards the kitchen as they heard Tumbler speak. She was still for a moment before she shook herself, looking up to him apologetically. \"Sorry Raines. I haven't been sleeping much-guess I'm too jumpy to be mainlining caffeine, huh?\" He gave her a grateful grin, refusing to point out that she'd very nearly jumped out of her skin. He had no idea what was going on with her but it was obvious she wasn't going to tell them. Meaning he would have to push to get the information-something he refused to do. Ripley had been one of the few that hadn't pestered him about Sway and his Mom, telling him that when he was ready to talk she'd listen but she wasn't going to beat the information out of him the way Atley and Otto wanted to. It was a private matter and she respected that . . . so he would do the same for her. \"Its fine, Rip. Just cut back until you've caught yourself up. I can ride up to San Jose with you if that's what you want to do . . . I honestly don't know if bringing anything here from Avalon is a good idea. Junie filled me on the fight you had just getting Penn to agree to the paint. Nice job with that by the way-none of us could've handled Pepto Bismol pink so we really do appreciate it.\" She nodded, reaching up to push her hair out of her face; giving him a blushing smile before she glanced back to the hallway. She watched the hall as she spoke her voice becoming distant as she seemed to close in on herself, making Memphis feel like there was a valley between them instead of inches. \"It was no problem, Raines. I'm going to be here a lot from the looks of things. And I couldn't handle that damn pink. You guys can handle the flowers right?\" Memphis went to answer before movement caught his eye; Atley pushing into the room scant seconds later with Sphinx on his heels before they both stopped short. Jackson raised a brow but Sphinx seemed to darken, his brows tugging down hard as his lips thinned into a hard line. Ripley bristled before she turned, looking back up to him as she sighed. Now what were they fighting about? Sphinx had lived to aggravate the lavender blond since she'd come back into the fold three years before but there were times that even Atley had gotten fed up with the man's attitude towards her. He sighed, tugging her flush against his side; nodding towards the flowers painted all over his wall as he called back to Atley. They were pale and faint, barely visible until the light hit them. They could deal with them until Penn outgrew them . . . or moved out, whichever came first. God knowing their luck it would probably be the latter wouldn't it? \"What do you think Jackson? The room pass?\" Atley grinned, coming closer as he ribbed her; his brows wagging as he nodded towards the wall. \"They're fine, Ripley. Hell, they're not ponies and crowns so they're perfect . I just can't believe you managed to talk her outta the princess shit.\" Ripley smiled back to Atley, her eyes bright and warm as she blushed and nodded. Only to practically crumble into stone as Sphinx spoke. Atley glared over his shoulder at the normally stoic boost as Ripley moved away from him; rubbing her arm as she put distance between them. All the while staying away from Jackson and Sphinx as she edged closer to the door. \"Never figured you'd be up for all o' this domestic shite, Girlie. Not with the way you refuse to dress and act like a proper lady.\" She cut her eyes to Sphinx, shaking her head as she pushed out of the room; the towering brute's brows furrowing at her parting quip before Atley smacked him in the side. \"You don't know a fucking thing about me Sphinx. You never have and you never will-not until you pull your head out of your ass.\" Memphis sighed, shaking his head before he turned to Atley; trying to keep himself from being angry. Ripley and Sphinx had never tolerated one another; they would never be able to do more than run together. They'd proven that time and again, every single period of peace always ending in harsh glares and harsher words. But the knowledge didn't make watching them fight any easier to stomach. Jackson seemed to be on the same train of thought, grumbling at the obviously nonplussed man while he crossed his arms. \"Jesus man you just couldn't help yourself could you? Is it so hard not to try and pick a fight with her?\" Sphinx shrugged, unapologetic as he looked around the room in bored interest; stepping past them to inspect the flower covered wall as Atley growled in aggravation at his response. God how had these two stayed friends for over a decade? Sphinx looked over the wall before nodding once, turning to Memphis with another dip of his chin as he made his way towards the front of the house. \"She's a big girl, boy-o. She'll be fine. Raines let Jackson know when you're movin' whatever furniture. I don't mind lendin' a hand.\" Atley turned, grumbling as he shook his head; glaring at his retreating back. \"Christ, the two of them are going to be the death of me. Between the damned loser boyfriend she refuses to tell me anything about and him always stirring her up I don't know who's gonna get axed first. Anyway Cacuzza said he'd look into everything to do with Sway. It might take some time but that's the one thing we seem to have plenty of at the moment. As soon as I hear something you'll be the first to know. What are you going to do about furniture for the kid? Everything back in Avalon was pretty ratty.\" Memphis raised a brow, crossing his arms before he sighed. He hadn't known Ripley was dating anyone; then again it was none of his business. And he didn't want to get in the middle of whatever drama was going on between the two feistier members of his crew. He had enough to deal with trying to get used to being a Dad. The others were just going to have to fend for themselves for a while until he got that under wraps. But even with that thought in his head he still found himself asking. \"Rip's already on point. She switched a couple of shifts with one of the other guys at Archaic so she could help us get this finished this weekend. And Junie swore she'd kill me if I let anyone else keep her while we worked or ran so we're covered on that front-for a while at least. As far as the rest just let me know . . . Is-is she okay? Ripley? She seems tired. Down. \" Atley snorted, rolling his eyes as he shook his head; running a hand down his face with a groan. \"No she really isn't. Dirtbag she's been seeing has been jerking her around more than usual. I'm worried Randall . . . but she won't tell me anything other than she knows what she's doing. That she knew what was what before she ever started up with this guy and she could handle it. All I know is I'd like for her to dump his ass and let me handle him. The fucker. \" Memphis frowned, shaking his head. \"Well unfortunately Sphinx is right Atley. Ripley's a big girl and she'd kill us for meddling in her shit- if the embarrassment of having us do something stupid didn't kill her first. Just give her the time and space to do what she needs. She'll have enough eventually. When's our next run?\" Okay going to take a nap now before the vampires come for more blood.[Chapter 8] Its short but serves a purpose. Shop Memphis stood just behind Otto, watching Penn insect the shop with sharp critical eyes; uncaring that she was dragging her precious stuffed rabbit through a pool of oil as she turned and inspected their work. He'd tried to get out of the house before she'd woken up, Kip and Tumbler already on point to watch her for the few hours he would absolutely have to be in the garage. But Penn had proven that for of her inability to hear the word NO she could hear everything else perfectly. Especially the tell-tale sound of Eleanor cranking and backing slowly out of their driveway. Raines turned as Penn stilled her shocked little gasp enough to make him cringe as Otto winced. She'd found something she wanted . . . meaning they were screwed unless they at least let her look at it. God why was this two year old so difficult? Surely they weren't all like this, right? Otto sighed, running a hand down his face before he moved to catch her; his calmest look and kindest voice already in place as he smiled down to her. \"Now Sweetpea you need to wait on us-\" Penn scuttled forward; disregarding the warning as she drug Barnaby through the oil and dirt on her way into Otto's paint dock. Memphis closed his eyes, already dreading the fight ahead of him. Not to get her out of the paint dock-oh no that would be as simple as picking her up and tossing her over his shoulder if it came down to it. No the fight would be wrestling the now dirty dingy rabbit away from her to wash. Kip and Tumbler both had been bitten a few times before Ripley had decided to use subterfuge . . . and he knew their friend wouldn't repeat the process for anything in the world. Not with the way Penn hadn't let her out of her sight the entire time the rabbit had been in the washer and dryer. Memphis moved to follow his daughter, stopping as he saw what had caught her attention. Hex was in the paint dock, spraying a smooth layer of black paint onto the primed body of an El Camino as he hummed to himself. Otto stopped just behind Memphis, watching Penn move to stand just beside the Irishman; tugging his shirt with her free hand as she cuddled Barnaby closer. Hex to his credit didn't jump the way he normally did at a shock, turning to look at her through his mask before he finished his last pass and turned off the gun; setting it aside as he pushed his goggles and breather up onto his forehead. The towering boost grinned down to her, balancing his weight on the balls of his feet as he bounced lightly in place. Listening to her as she smiled and started to talk, showing him Barnaby and even reaching up to mess in his wildly curling hair. \"Hi uncle Hex! Whatcha doing? What's that thing? Why's parts of the car black and parts not? How come you were wearin that funny mask?\" Hex's grin spread as he picked the sprayer up, showing her the gun and how it worked; holding it out so she could pull the trigger. A spray of fine black paint dusted the plastic tarp at their feet; Penn's eyes widening before she turned back to him with pleading hopeful eyes. \" OOOOH! Can I try that? I promise to be good!\" Hex grinned and shrugged, turning back to Memphis with a questioning look. They all knew that they shouldn't really let her help him paint, not when there was such a margin for error and this was for a paying customer. But the hopeful look on her face kept Memphis from disagreeing out right. Otto however just smiled, moving forward to kneel beside the two as he slowly slid the gun from their joined hands. The former boost nodded to Hex, shooing him off as he slid the goggles from his head; pushing them over Penn's and tightening the strap as far as it would go. \"I got this. You boys go on.\" Hex rolled his eyes, pushing to his feet as he brushed himself off; looking to Raines expectantly. Well that was one disaster averted . . . now what did they do? Ripley pushed through the doors of the garage, trying to juggle the burgeoning bags as she fought her way towards the steps. She huffed, only to growl as her hair fell into her eyes; momentarily blinding her before she shook them away. The next time she saw Junie Halliwell fighting a sea of overloaded bags from the trunk and backseat of her car she knew just to keep on walking. She didn't need to stop and volunteer to help carry things in-even if the woman's bright smiles and thankful attitude had fleetingly reminded her of her mother. She moved to take the first step onto the iron staircase, nearly tripping as she almost missed it. She closed her eyes, trying to gather herself before she shook her head. Nope. This was her lesson and she needed to learn it. Before being nice landed her with a broken neck. Junie magically appeared beside her, laden down with enough bags to cloth Indonesia and blinding smile. The older woman laughed, pushing her up the steps towards the office; starting a friendly conversation as they went. \"Thank you for helping me, honey. I swear the men around here see me show up with shopping bags and run! Like it would kill them to do some honest work!\" Ripley nodded, unsure of how to respond. She didn't normally talk to the others. Sure she wasn't rude or anything but she mostly kept to herself; never letting the rest of their crew-save Atley and maybe Hex-know what she was doing besides boosting and tatting. She'd learned the hard way that too many people in the know only led to heartbreak and disappointment . . . and she sure as hell wasn't going to end up in a 4'x4' cell like her brother. She'd have to gut someone first. Junie picked up on some of her dilemma, her smile softening as she pushed the office door open; setting her bags down before she took Ripley's with a nod. The elder red head looked to her for a few long moments, her eyes taking in every detail as Ripley started to fidget. It wasn't that she didn't like Junie-far from it, she loved the woman to pieces and she always had-she just tried to keep the different aspects of her life separate now. Not that she had much luck with the way her love life was going but hey; she tried damn it. \"It's good to see you coming around more. I remember-before everything happened with Mikhail you would just breeze in to visit or talk. I know it probably makes me sound like an old fuddy duddy but I miss that. Lord knows you're the only boost that could actually carry on a conversation with me about something other than cars-even Sway would get so caught up that Italians was all she would talk about here.\" Ripley felt her cheeks flush, her chin dipping on its own as she glanced to her feet. Great now she felt like an ass. But as she raised her head and went to speak, to start to apologize Junie moved; slinging one of her arms over her shoulders as she tugged her close. She pressed her bangs against her temple, squeezing her tight for just a second before she let go; smiling to her as she rubbed her arm. \"I know the past few years have been hard honey-especially for you and the Raines but it'll all get better. And until it does-after it does you have a home here. So stop shouldering everything and let us carry some. We've done it for the others; we don't mind doing it for you. Just remember that, no matter what it is we're here for you, okay? We have been since the first day you strolled through with Atley and Khail.\" Ripley blinked back the tears trying to spring forth, reaching up to swipe at her face with shaky hands as a watery laugh escaped her lips. \"Am I that obvious?\" Junie hugged her again, giving her a conspiratorial wink; leaning in to whisper to her. Ripley's hand came up to grip Junie's as her eyes closed, sagging into the contact that as relief washed over her. Oh thank God for that; because if anyone else had noticed just how damned crazy the past year and half had been driving her then she wouldn't survive the humiliation. \"Only to the people who've known you since you were fifteen, Sweetheart. Before you ask Atley and Otto haven't said anything but they are starting to notice. You need to let whatever's been eating away at you go-before you don't have anything left for it to eat up. I know all of this isn't just over your brother.\" She shook her head, cutting her eyes to Junie; biting her lip as she tried to decide. Had Junie picked up on the tension between her and Sphinx; on how odd everything was between them when they were separate? And if she had did she acknowledge the affair and face the consequences? Or did she just keep going the way she had been; deny it to let everything crumble and fall where it landed then pick up the pieces? How would she even begin to explain that she had been seeing one of the other runners but neither had told anyone? But as she opened her mouth to speak, to start actually talking about some of the things Junie granted her an out; her eyes becoming soft and sad as she tugged her closer. \"Does this have to do with everything about Penn? I mean it's impossible not to notice that little girl has taken to you. And I know that it isn't something you've ever considered wanting but it isn't a bad thing that she has. Who knows, helping out with her could be good practice for your own little monsters one day.\" Ripley laughed, relieved that while Junie had picked up something bothering her that she'd skirted by the largest issue. Meaning she still had time to figure out where things between her and sphinx stood before she had to face the reality of telling the others. She hugged Junie, happy that today wasn't the day she had to come clean-even if she knew it wouldn't be that far in the future. They'd hidden this pretty well for almost two years but she was getting tired of the secrets and sneaking. What had been fun before just made her weary now . . . mostly because he didn't seem too intent to change it. She shook herself, pointing to the bags with a grin. \"I know, Junie. It's just odd to have someone who wants to be around me. I mean, you have to admit most people like to stay at least ten paces back in case I blow a gasket or something. Your husband included.\" Junie rolled her eyes, pushing her forward as she pulled a bag closer; tossing tissue paper aside so she could see the contents. \"Oh don't even try that with me, Missy. These men may believe all of that horseshit but I sure don't. Just because you don't let them walk all over you doesn't mean you're a loose cannon. Mean and crazy and just the tiniest bit sadistic sure but not a loose cannon. Penn just sees the part of you they don't.\" Ripley gave Junie a deadpan look before the older woman sighed, throwing her hands up in a flout. \"Okay fine! Penn sees it, she just doesn't care! There! Happy? \" She nodded once, turning back to the bags only to jump when Junie flicked her in the back of the head; making her wince and duck. \" Junie!\" \"Oh don't even start! Your head's hard enough! Now help me get this stuff together! I know Memphis hasn't had the chance to buy Penny any clothes or toys so Otto and I went this morning to help out.\" Ripley narrowed her eyes before turning back to the bags, raising a brow at the overabundance of pink. She glanced back to Junie, crossing her arms. \"Help out or buy a loyal minion?\" Junie grinned, winking again as she started tugging things out to show her; her expression nowhere near as innocent as her voice. \"Now why in the world would you think that? Just because I bought her a few things doesn't mean I'm trying to buy her obedience. That comes later-right now we're trying to buy happiness and time for her to settle. Now less talking and more riffling. Otto's only going to be able to keep Memphis away for so long and we all know he won't let her have these things if he sees them first. It's bad enough I had to bring everything here! I still can't believe that she wouldn't let him leave her at the house.\" Ripley blinked, stunned. \"Penn's here? But how did he get her here? I thought they weren't going to try and get a car seat until this weekend.\" Junie rolled her eyes again, giving her a knowing smile. \"Because Memphis Raines is already wrapped around that little girl's finger. And San's ex let them borrow Henry's old seat until they grab one tomorrow. Are you going?\" Ripley thought for a second before she cringed, shaking her head as she shuddered. \"There's no way in hell I'm going carseat shopping with that kid. You think painting was bad? I had to give her a bath and clean up the rabbit! The Raines brothers can deal with this one on their own.\" two more for today . . . maybe. I don't know, depends on how long i actually stay awake.[Chapter 9] Alright there have been some questions about the relationship between Ripley and Sphinx. Their relationship-at this point- is casual; meaning they see each other whenever but they can see other people. I know Sphinx is coming off a little different-especially from Ripley's POV but it all serves a purpose. I can't tell you how things work out, I can just tell you that it will. Eventually . . . Maybe. I will go ahead and apologize for any grammatical errors now-it was proof read but too closely. Assumptions Sphinx watched Ripley hover just behind the tiny toddler oohing and ahhing at the toys Junie kept producing. He'd only planned to stop in long enough to collect his cut from the night before and be on his way. But something about the atmosphere in the office had caught him, snaring his interest and keeping him just inside the doorway as Otto's wife kept tugging random things from the sea of bottomless bags strewn across the desk and floor. The girl herself was enthralled; eyes shining as Junie practically threw dolls ponies and the most ridiculously girlie things as her. Ripley groaning ever so often as she tried to contain the mess and keep it from spreading beyond the desk. Sphinx turned, cutting his eyes back to Ripley as she sighed; shaking her head as Junie placed a garishly glittered pink crown on Penn's head. The little girl giggled and teetered, clapping happily before she turned to Ripley excitedly. Her light blue eyes practically shown as she reached back and wrapped around Ripley's legs, her chin practically resting on her knees as she giggled and chattered. \"Thank you Gramma Junie! Aunt Ripley lookit!\" Sphinx raised a brow, waiting for Ripley to extract herself from the kid; knowing that the smiles were about to end abruptly. Ripley didn't do well with touching for no reason. Hell, she'd been his only consistent bedmate for close to two years and she still flinched if he caught her off guard. But the tensed shoulders and awkward shuffle back never came, Ripley's eyes warming as she reached down and plucked the crown from Penn's curls. And plopped it into her own with an exaggerated grin as Penn squealed and Junie laughed. Sphinx blinked, watching the normally sarcastic and brash woman transform into an almost different person; all smiles and warmth and complete contentment as she modeled her stolen prize. Penn laughed along with her, reaching for her crown. \"Hey! Auntie Ripley that's mine !\" Ripley raised a brow, tapping her chin in faux consideration as she looked down to Penn. \"Are you sure? Crowns are for Princesses. And I hate to break it to you kiddo but you don't look like a Princess.\" Penn huffed, brows drawn and lip puckered as she pointed to the crown; a tiny replica of Sway as she flouted and pouted. \"Cause you gots my crown!\" Ripley blinked innocently before reaching up, feeling at the crown before she moved it back to Penn's curls; straightening as it started to slide down. She leaned back, nodding once with a goofy grin; winking to Junie as the older woman laughed even harder. \"Oh. There, see? Problem fixed!\" Penn laughed, shaking her head; her fingers reaching up to trace the crown even as she grinned. \"You're silly, Aunt Ripley. Almost as silly as Uncle Tommy.\" Ripley shrugged, turning to drop another toy into the bags when she glanced towards the door; freezing in place as she spotted him. Sphinx's brows furrowed on their own, his curiosity overridden by irritation as he watched Ripley start to shut down; pulling back now that she'd seen he was there. It bothered him that he could see a difference in her now-even if he knew the only reason he hadn't before is because he hadn't bothered to. Until her trip to Avalon he hadn't had reason to; had always assumed that her attitude was permanent. Her own little quirk that had made dealing with her so horrid before they'd started fucking. But now he knew better . . . and suddenly so much of Atley's irrational paranoid bickering made at least some sort of sense. Their crew had faced a lot of trials and tribulations within the past four years-and if Atley's drunken ramblings were to be believed Ripley hadn't exactly had it easy for the eight years before that- but he'd always assumed she just shouldered through it. She didn't seem like it bothered her but then again not much ever did. He frowned, watching her glance away from him; turning back to Penn's excited chirp with a much more subdued smile. If something had been bothering her, eating away at her she would've said something. At the very least to him. He knew that they weren't exactly stable in their ties to one another but they were involved enough for her to talk to him. Right? \"Oh Sphinx! Sorry honey I didn't see you. Here, Otto left this in case you happened through.\" Junie's voice broke him from his thoughts, the elder woman moving towards the desk as Penn turned and spotted him; stopping dead in her tracks as her tiny eyes widened comically. He raised a brow but turned to Junie, nodding as she handed him the envelope containing his latest cut as Penn edge closer to Ripley. He watched the girl sneak behind the lavender blonde boost, her tiny fingers knotting in the hem of Ripley's shirt as she tugged on the garment; her light blue eyes never leaving him. He hadn't really seen Pennelope yet-not when she was awake in any case- but he could tell that most of Atley and Tumbler's whining was unjustified. Sure she was probably a terror but she was only a kid. She couldn't possibly be as bad as they claimed . . . not and still be breathing at least. She'd been primarily raised by Sway until the week before so it stood to reason she could behave. They just hadn't found the secret to making her. And so long as no one expected him to be part of anything until they did then everything would be fine. Ripley looked down to Penn, her face carefully neutral as she dipped to listen to the now whispering girl. Sphinx watched her lean back, eyeing Penn skeptically before she cut her eyes back to him; her reticence almost palatable as she pulled her bottom lip between her teeth. After a long moment she sighed straightening as she pushed Penn towards him; the girl's squeak causing both of his brows to raise nearly to his hairline. Ripley however just sighed, rolling her eyes skyward before she shook her head. \"God why me? Why do I have to do the hard stuff while the Raines brothers skate by?\" Penn turned back to her, indignant before she squawked as Ripley nudged her forward again. The girl paled her eyes wide before she tried to bolt; nearly behind Ripley before she caught her by the back of her shirt. The boost shook her head, tugging the kid back in between them; giving her another gentle push forward as she prodded her. \" Oh -ho ; no you don't. Go on. He isn't going to bite you-not with me here. He knows he won't get to keep his teeth if he does.\" Sphinx glared hard at Ripley before he looked back to Penn, willing his scowl away as she twisted the hem of her shirt nervously. Christ the kid looked terrified. Ripley sighed and knelt beside her, giving her another gentle push towards him; her voice warm and soft despite the firm warning look she shot him. He wanted to roll his eyes as he knelt to their level, watching the kid ease just the tiniest bit closer as she reached down and caught Ripley's hand. Her little knuckles were white she was holding on so tightly but Ripley just smiled, smoothing her free hand over Penn's shoulder and the side of her neck. \"Hey, honey. It's fine. Sphinx here is one of your Dad's friends-just like me. He wouldn't ever hurt you, alright?\" Penn cut her eyes to Ripley, seeming skeptical before she glanced back to him; her chapped bottom lip clamped between little white teeth as she looked him over critically. Sphinx fought the urge to chuckle, admitting that watching the toddler try to size him up-the same way her parents had before her- was comical. Just like he knew if he did laugh she would probably squeak and dive behind the very girl she was still clinging to. \"He's one of your friends, Aunt Ripley?\" Sphinx smirked despite himself as Ripley looked torn, nodding to the girl as the boost decided to glare at him. He knew why she'd looked so puzzled, that she'd been racking her brain for a child friendly answer about their association before she realized there really wasn't one. There wasn't a nice way to say they occasionally slept together . . . at least not to a toddler. Ripley's eyes narrowed before she grinned, leaning in to hug Penn; the girl giggling as her fingers skated over her sides. Oh whatever she was about to do was not going to be good for his reputation. Or his ego. \"Oh sure, Sweetheart. Why, Mr. Sphinx here is one of mine and your Dad's oldest friends. He's almost as old as grouchy Uncle Atley.\" Penn's eyes grew wide before her brows knit, her bottom lip puckering again. \"Nuh-uh. Uncle Atley's old-almost like a dinosaur . He don't look like that.\" Ripley bit her lip, her eyes locking with him as he chuckled. Okay maybe Jackson hadn't been exaggerating. She had the Raines mouth and the Wayland attitude. No wonder his friend had been scarce whenever the kid was mentioned. She was a prissy mouthy little thing . . . but he found he didn't mind it. \"Oh please tell me she's told 'im that.\" Ripley shook her head, prodding Penn as she pulled back. \"You talk weird.\" \" PENN!\" Sphinx chuckled, shrugging as Ripley paled and hissed. \"You can't say shit like that!\" Penn turned, arms crossed as she stamped her foot; the epitome of righteous indignation as she looked to the lavender haired girl like she was crazy. \"Well it's true! He does talk weird. And you said a wordy dirt! You're gonna get in trouble!\" Ripley rolled her eyes, waving the kid off before she pushed her closer to Sphinx. \"He has an accent because he's from Britian-another country. And it isn't nice to say things like that because it could hurt their feelings.\" She cut her eyes to meet his, something in her tone raw and shifting before it was gone; replaced by the same happy giggles from before. But he'd seen the slip, had heard the catch in her voice but the question was why? They always went on like this with one another-they probably always would. She was the only one who would pop off at him and argue, who didn't let his size or less than pleasant disposition keep her from speaking her mind. And she had to know that for all his aggravation with her he hardly ever meant what he said in front of the others. \"Not his-because Mr. Sphinx here doesn't really have feelings but it could other people.\" Penn stilled, chewing on her bottom lip deep in thought before she brightened; grinning up to Ripley like she'd solved one of life's greatest mysteries. \"Oh. Well can I just tell you? That way someone else knows but me?\" Ripley looked to the little girl for a long moment before she gave a long suffering sigh, nodding as she ruffled the girl's hair around her forgotten crown. But despite her aggravation it was easy to see the affection beneath it. Something sphinx realized was usually lacking when Ripley dealt with anyone else; himself included unless they were nude. And even then it all faded as soon as he left her bed, any warmth disappearing completely once he was out of her door. How hadn't he noticed this? \"Sure kiddo. You can tell me anything you want. Now, go be nice and introduce yourself.\" Penn turned back to him; grinning and preening as she shifted on her feet. \"I'm Pennelope-but everybody calls me Penn!\" Sphinx smiled, cutting his eyes up to Ripley before he nodded to the girl; reaching out to straighten her now lopsided crown as she dipped her head and blushed. \"Sphinx, love. It's nice to meet you, Penn.\" Penn giggled and darted away from them, rushing back to Junie as the older woman glanced away; trying to hide her smile as Penn started jumping around her. Finally the girl caught her hand, trying to pull her towards the office door and the stairs beyond; chattering excitedly as she used all of her weight to tug on the now laughing woman. \"Gramma Junie! Can we show Daddy Memphis and Uncle Skipper my crown? Please?!\" Junie melted, nodding as she let the excitable toddler drag her along; sighing as she tried to keep her steady on her feet. \"Okay Sweetpea. We're going now. We just have to be careful on these old steps, okay?\" Sphinx turned back to the girl, watching Ripley's grin fade with Penn's voice; her eyes cutting to him uncertainly. She nodded, pushing her hair out of her face shyly. A definite first for them. Ripley did loud, brash, cynical bossy and even bitchy-but shy? Not so much; not with him anyway. \"Thank you-for not scaring her.\" Sphinx shrugged, watching as she turned to the bags; picking up the toys and clothes to fold and put away. He stepped further into the room, settling beside her on the edge of the desk as he watched her for a few moments. His eyes tracked over the pinks and purples, trying to decipher what was what before he finally sighed. \"What's all this then?\" Ripley snorted, picking up a painfully pink teddy bear and waving it to him before she chucked into the bag with its brethren; cringing before she shuddered. \"This is Otto and Junie going of the deep end. I think they bought every stitch of pink in Los Angeles County!\" He nodded, watching as she picked up Penn's coat; smoothing the material before she folded it and set it beside the biggest bag. Only to move on to the next stack of new clothes and repeat the process quickly and quietly. It shocked him, seeing her so docile-calm and content even though he could still taste how nervous she was. \"You're good with her.\" Her voice broke him out of his thoughts, bringing his eyes up to hers. She gave him a hesitant little smile as she nodded towards the stairs; her cheeks flushed a pretty pink as she looked up to him bashfully. And though it was odd-considering their relationship it wasn't unwelcomed. Honestly it made warmth flood through him, his skin tingling at her touch when she reached out and squeezed his hand; giving him a pointed look. \"Just a heads up, you're probably going to be Mr. Sphinx from here on out. Think you can adjust to that?\" Sphinx watched her for a long moment before he dipped his chin once, mirroring her grin with one of his own as she stepped closer. \"Sure, Girlie. Can you?\" Ripley rolled her eyes, shaking her head at him before she gave him a deadpan look. \"I've been handling it, asshat.\" He chuckled, catching her fingers as she tried to pull away; his next words shocking both of them as he kept her close. He had no idea why he'd even asked the stupid question but he had; his own curiosity at her answer overriding his common sense. \"Do you want one?\" She blinked, looking to him like he was crazy before she waved the plush lady bug she'd been putting away at him; her lips tugging to the side in a sarcastic smirk as she teased him. \"What? A ladybug? I think I'm good, Sphinx.\" He shook his head, squeezing her hand again; looking to her pointedly. \"A kid, Girlie. Not a toy-a kid.\" Ripley jerked like he'd electrocuted her, pulling away before she looked to him skeptically. Finally she just shrugged; settling back into putting things away even though she was nowhere near as content as she had been. He watched her for a few moments, trying to understand her change in mood as she started to work faster than she had. He hadn't meant the question in anyway other than as a passing thought but watching her with the girl had made him curious. She was good with the kid, better than he'd expected her to capable of. And she'd steadily proven all week that she was far more than any of them suspected-what with her overhaul of Penn's room and the strings she'd been pulling to help Kip and Memphis. It was only logical to assume-with everything she was doing for a child that wasn't hers that she would eventually want children of her own. Ripley glanced to him quickly before she cut her eyes to her watch, eyes wide before she cursed and started moving to pack Penn's things faster. \" Shit . I've got to get going. At this rate I'm not going to get to eat! Damn it, I knew helping Junie would bite me in the ass.\" She turned, sliding into her coat before she grabbed her bag; casting him a hesitant glance. She was warring over asking him something, which meant she knew he would probably be unsure of. It was a look he'd seen a few times-when she'd cooked before he'd pop in or touch him when they weren't completely alone. But before where it had always made him weary he found himself almost looking forward to what she'd say. To see if the warmth and affection he'd glimpsed outside of their bedroom would actually carry here or if she'd just let it drop. The way she usually did. He stilled, stunned to realize how many times she actually had that look and didn't ever say anything; just sighed or shook her head and went on about her business. But she had to know he would at least listen to her. He was with her more than he'd ever been with another person-involved and invested despite what they both liked to claim. She knew that-didn't she? After a moment she turned from him, shaking her head; shouldering her bag before she went to move past him. Sphinx reached out, catching her forearm only to scowl as she flinched. He glowered at her, letting her go in huff as he saw her shoulders tense. This he knew-had seen a thousand times. She was bracing herself for a fight . . . but the question was why? What had he done to make her go on the defensive like this so quickly? \"Oh for Christ's sakes ! You let t he kid roll and wallow all over you but the second I touch you, you flinch?\" She glared up at him, straightening her coat before she sighed heavily; reaching up to push her hair out of her face. The lavender tint wasn't as bright as it had been, faded to the point that it was just barely purple at all; making her skin seem darker and her eyes lighter. He'd never understood her obsession with the color but he hadn't spoken against it, occasionally running his fingers through the odd colored curls while she would doze against him. Her real color-the almost white platinum-made her look too much like a doll; adding a femininity to her that before today would've been laughable. Her voice shook him from his thoughts, making him scowl at her all over again. He'd never told her that he didn't want to be seen with her! He didn't relish going out at all. Too many crowds and people; too many chances for something to go wrong or for something to happen. She might not like to remember it but they ran almost exclusively for Cacuzza. And while the mobster was usually good at keeping them safe between runs there had been a few close calls with other crews over the years. \"Yeah, well Penn doesn't mind being seen in public with me.\" But he didn't tell her any of that, letting her little quip enrage him to the point that he fired right back at her. Only where her words had been hurt because of a misconception his tore through her with purpose and intent. Something he didn't even realize until she gasped and drew back from him; looking to him like he'd carved out her heart and was dangling it in front of her. \"Trust me-once the new wears off that'll change. And quick .\" Ripley jerked like he'd hit her, eyes wide before her face just shut down; everything about her going cold and distant as she shoved past him. He reached for her but she pushed him back, not stopping long enough to listen as he finally managed to catch her wrist. Her fists clenched, her knuckles cracking ominously as her shoulders shook and jittered. But Sphinx didn't let her go, tightening his grip on her wrist as he struggled to find the words to repair the damage he'd done. Christ why had he said anything at all? They'd actually had a nice moment before they'd started to bicker. \"Girlie, I-\" She stopped, cutting her eyes to him; the blue green cold and hard while her words were sharp and cutting. She'd never laid into him like before . . . and he'd never once thought that she felt like this. \"Ripley. My name is Ripley. You'd think after fucking me for nearly two years you'd remember that.\" She snorted running a shaking hand over her face before she continued. \"But then again apparently that's all I'm good for right? Fucking. I mean you're embarrassed to be seen with me-Hell we haven't ever been out together to do anything but boost.\" Sphinx opened his mouth, scrambling to try and make her see reason. He hadn't meant anything other than sarcasm, hadn't meant to hit the nerve he'd so obviously plucked. But she didn't care to see that. She was too hurt and angry to do anything but rail against him now that he'd finally hit her breaking point. The only problem was he hadn't even known he'd been trampling all over it. \"Now that's not true and you know it. We've been out together plenty-with Atley and the others-\" \"But not alone , Sphinx. And Atley had to threaten to have the Malibu towed to even get you to occasionally eat lunch with us. Hell even then you do nothing but criticize and push, try and pick away at me before someone separates us. God I'm such a fucking idiot-just forget it okay! As a matter of fact, forget everything! \" She pushed past him; not giving him the chance to catch her again as she practically ran down the steps. He followed her as she pushed off the last metal rung; watching as she rushed by Atley and Otto before giving Junie and Penn a quick passing wave. But as she went to push by Memphis to get to her car Raines caught her, pulling her towards the back paint dock that he and Halliwell generally worked in together. Sphinx stilled just behind the thick sheets of rubber and plastic strung up to keep the paint in the dock, watching Memphis look over his girl critically before he sighed. Raines had her and wouldn't let her leave-not without at least making sure she was okay. Besides he needed to give her the time to calm down, let her have the space to put herself back together before the tried to have this conversation again. He'd kept a casual relationship with Ripley because he'd never dreamed she would want more . . . and now that he knew she did-that she apparently had for a while he was left with a decision to make. Did he want to push forward into that or was he content the way he was? Would the promise of seeing her as happy as she had been with Penn and Junie-knowing that maybe that happiness could be partly because of him be worth the trouble of weathering her wilder ways? Christ how had he even gotten into this mess? I know. I know. On to the next one before anyone plots my death here.[Chapter 10] This idea would not leave me alone-mainly because I know people who've done this and never once regretted it. This was written for the random prompt \"ink\". But you guys already guessed that from the title, huh? Ink Memphis swallowed the lump in his suspiciously dry throat, trying not to fidget as Ripley looked up to him like he was insane. He knew he'd only had Penn for a week. That she hadn't settled in completely and there was always the possibility-however unlikely- that something could happen to take her away from him. But none of that changed the fact that he was her father; that he'd had a daughter for almost three years and hadn't known it. At first he'd been numb, rolling and turning over the fact that he' been lied to and mislead; pushing all of it aside to give his newly acquired child the support and comfort she needed. But the longer she was there, the more he saw that he didn't know her at all the more the anger started to seep in. At first it had been passing thoughts, just tiny little cynical snippets floating through his head. But now . . . now it was getting worse. He'd never fully made peace with the fact that Sway had up and left without so much as a word, only leaving him a shitty little letter and a promise that she would always love him. But what good would loving him do if she wasn't there to do it? What good did loving him do while she was hiding his kid; not telling her the first damn thing about him other than he lived somewhere else and couldn't live with them? He clenched his fists, his knuckles cracking as Ripley raised a brow at him; her slightly red and puffy eyes looking over him skeptically bringing him to rights. He shook himself, hating that his cheeks were tingeing red but he didn't bother to fight it. Ripley had proven that she was a pretty neutral bystander in their most recent drama; stepping up to help when she could before she eased back into the fringes of their little psycho-fuck-family. Memphis sighed, raking his hand down his face as both of her brows rose nearly into her hairline; all of her anger and hurt from moments before replaced by stunned disbelief. Okay so he knew it was odd but damn it he wasn't going to change his mind. He didn't need to change his mind. Circumstances and lies had taken two years from his family . . . and he was going to do anything he could to prove that he hadn't been an active part of it. He would spend his dying breath trying to prove that he loved his kid-his family. Something he knew Ripley was all too familiar with. So why was she looking at him like he'd grown a second head? Finally she sighed, shifting her bag to her free shoulder as she opened it; digging through the cluttered mess for a few seconds before she pulled out a small spiral bound notebook. He raised a brow before he blinked, stunned at what was revealed when she opened the tiny book. It wasn't a notebook-it was a sketchbook. Filled nearly to the brim with various tattoo concepts and doodles, random sketches overlapping gothic calligraphy and flowing tribal lines. His eyes moved up to meet hers as she spoke, making him shake his head to clear his thoughts as she huffed and rolled her eyes skyward. What in the hell was she talking about now? \"Oh for the love of God! Why do I keep getting stuck with all of the awkward mentally incapacitated idiots today? First him and now you?\" Memphis glared as she continued to loo to him expectantly; finally huffing again as she motioned for him to speak as she dug for a pen. \"Well? Are you going to give me a premise here Raines or do I get to guess? I mean if you leave it up to me its going to be littered with pink crowns and smiling ponies . . . so it might behoove you to speak up here.\" Raines raised a brow, crossing his arms. \"Behoove?\" She nodded, plucking a pen from the mess of her purse; uncapping it with her teeth before she cut her eyes back to him. Memphis stopped for a moment, trying not to smirk at the vision she made; hair down and wild with a sharpie cap hanging from her teeth as she looked to him expectantly. God how many of her clients got to see this side of her? The slightly addlebrained artist with her pointed looks and honey dipped cutting words. \"Yes Raines; behoove . As in benefit. As in you'd best tell me what you want before you use the last shreds of my patience-because I refuse to be held responsible for the massacre if you continue to take your sweet time here. I do have to go to work some time today. Do you know where you want it to go?\" Memphis felt his cheeks flush as he ducked his head, giving her a sheepish grin before he stepped closer; trying to focus his thoughts enough to give her something to work with while he kept his voice low. He didn't want the others to know he was doing this-not yet. San, Otto, Atley and even maybe Hex would get it. Donnie, Toby and Sphinx wouldn't comment either way while Kip would probably want to go with him. But Tumbler, Mirror Freb and Frankie? He didn't want to hear their shit until he had to. At least not over something like this. \"Oh . . . sorry. Um, I don't know where I want it yet. I guess I just want her name-her whole name you know? But I don't want it all out in a line together the way people usually do. I kind of want it to be more you know? Maybe have something extra to it-but not a lot! Just enough to make it seem . . .i don't know regal? I mean is there even a way we can do that?\" Ripley looked to him for a long moment before her face softened, her eyes going warm as her lips spread into a shit eating grin around the cap still dangling from her teeth. She shook her head, looking to the paper as she began making quick lines and notes; turning the book to get a better angle whenever she hit a problem. In what seemed like no time she'd sketched out Penn's full name, the almost antiqued Pennelope arching over a very ornamental handwritten looking Helen ; both crowing a decorative but masculine Raines while all of these little lines and loops filled in the empty space. She glanced up to his chest before she shifted the bag back; taking the book and laying it over his heart. She turned her head to the side before she stopped; nodding to herself as she stepped back. \"That would work . . . but let me play with it some more. I'll work up a few variations over the next few days and we'll work from there. But right now I am really late and I've got to go. We can go over it Saturday-before we head up to Jose. Deal?\" Memphis nodded, watching as she started shoving things back in her bag; pushing out of the paint dock and into the main portion of the garage without so much as a goodbye. He turned, watching her push past the other workers and boosts; running towards the exit before she turned to wave goodbye to Penn. Who was jumping up and down screaming to get her to notice her. Raines blinked, watching Ripley stop and sigh; moving back inside to dip and let Penn hug her before she ruffled his daughter's hair and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek. He smirked as Penn's face spread into a grin, his daughter content to let his friend leave as she waved to her; Junie hiding her own giggles behind her hand as Ripley rolled her eyes and ran back towards her car. Penn turned, spotting him with a grin before she ran to him; arms wrapping around his neck as he scooped her up. She leaned against him, chattering happily as she reached up to fix her newest crown; her eyes shining as she squealed and laughed. Memphis smiled to her, reaching up to rub the spot Ripley had touched just moments before; trying not wince as he realized something crucial. Damnation if she hadn't picked the perfect spot . . . but Christ he knew it was going to hurt. Alright kiddies! That's all for today. I know the beginning of this one was a little darker but I kind of wanted to touch on all of the emotional strife that Memphis is going through. I mean, its got to be hard to find out you have a kid and not only was she hidden from you but the person responsible-for whatever reason-isn't there to answer for it. I didn't want it to seem like he's just breezing through here . . .[Chapter 11] This one is a bit on the short side . . . Seats August 2004 \"I don't want that one! I want the princesses!\" Memphis closed his eyes, trying not to growl as he clenched and unclenched his jaw. This shouldn't be so damned hard! But-as he was steadily discovering- nothing about Penn Raines was ever easy. Especially when it involved something she had to see every day. He took in a calming breath, intently ignoring the snickers from his brother as Kip coughed and tried to hide his laughter. Oh sure it was funny! He wasn't the one arguing with a toddler over her fucking car seat. Christ why hadn't he let Junie come with them today? Oh yeah, he wanted to prove he was capable of being a parent without the rest of the crew acting as a safety net. \"But Penn honey they don't have a princess one big enough for you. You need one like the gray one here-And look they have pink!\" Penn looked up at him like he was crazy, crossing her arms as her brows drew down in the most sinister scowl he'd ever seen. Her bottom lip puckered out as her eyes started to water, her cheeks darkening to a terrifying red as she glared up at him; the pitch of her voice making his ears want to bleed as she screeched. \"I don't want the pink! I want the princesses! Momma woulda got me the princesses! And you're 'posed to love me as much she did!\" Memphis felt his left eye tick as Kip sputtered and dropped against the metal shelving, clutching the gondola as he covered his face with his hands; making these strangled wheezing noises as his shoulders shook. The elder Raines turned, glaring at his little brother as Penn huffed and stomped her foot; turning away from both of them as she all but growled. Memphis grit his teeth, muttering to Kip as he continued to lean against the shelves; the whole display shaking from the force of his barely contained glee while Penn looked at the Princess carseat in determination. \"You'd better be cryin' back there, little brother. Or I swear to God Sphinx is going to find out who back into his Malibu at the last meet.\" Kip paled, wiping a hand down his face as he pushed away from the display; pouting as he nudged Memphis in the side with his elbow. \"Jeez, lighten up Randal. I only told you so you could make sure he didn't yell at Ripley! Besides you have to admit this is funny. I mean don't normal parents just buy the damned car seats and let that be that?\" Memphis opened his mouth to rebuke that statement, to plainly tell his brother that he wasn't like normal parents and he had to do everything in his power to keep his daughter as happy as he could-at least until she was used to them and the idea that her mother wasn't ever coming back- when Penn screamed. She threw her hands out, stomping her foot again as she shrieked; her voice raising with every new word. \"I hate it here! I hate you! Everything's different! I wanna go home!\" Memphis flinched, his chest going hollow and empty as Penn continued to rant; the toddler oblivious to the fact that she'd literally just ripped his heart out of his chest. He knew she wasn't happy with them-hell the only time she laughed or smiled was when she was around Junie and Ripley or being carted around on Hex's shoulders. He knew she hated her almost complete room-despite the fact that it was turning out to be a proverbial girly girl paradise with the doll houses and stuffed ponies and all of the damned clothes Junie had forced down their throats- just like he knew that she wished she were still with Sway. But Sway was gone . . . and he was the only one left to take her. Other than the State. Memphis collected himself, watching as Kip knelt; borrowing a line from their mother as he carefully caught Penn by the shoulders. The girl stopped mid-tantrum, so shocked that he'd touched her that her mouth was still open as Kip gave her a stern look. The same look that Memphis knew they had hated to see cross Helen Raines face. Mainly because it meant a guilt trip of massive proportions was brewing behind kind words and warm tear filled eyes . . . and Penn seemed to cue in on that just like they had. \"Pennelope, stop it. You know you don't mean that and it isn't nice to say it. Now if they had the princess seat we would get it but they don't so let's pick out another one and we'll go get some lunch okay?\" The girl stilled, looking at Kip before she sighed; flouting as she nodded. \"Fine, Uncle Kip. I guess I'll get the pink one . . . but only if we can get lunch with Aunt Ripley and Uncle Hex.\" Kip nodded, extending his hand to her; causing Penn to look at him like he was crazy. Memphis watched Kip laugh, getting one of Penn's hands and shaking it lightly once; the same way their father had anytime he made a deal with them. Memphis cleared his suddenly tight throat, feeling a little better about the situation as Kip prodded his daughter to apologize. \"Deal, Princess. But only if you apologize to your dad. You can't say stuff like that-it isn't nice.\" Penn looked to their hands, brow raised. \"Why? It's true. I don't like it here and everything is different-\" Kip rolled his eyes, poking her under her ribs; his voice staying mellow and even as he explained. Understanding slowly blossomed across Penn's features, replaced by guilt and repentance as she peaked up at him through her lashes; chewing on her bottom lip as she started to sniffle. \"We know it is-but it's all different for us too, kiddo. We aren't used to this . . . and your Dad loves you. He's changing everything to make our home your home. Would you like it if we told you how much we didn't like that?\" She shook her head, new tears pooling beneath her lashes. \"No . . . You do don't you? Like that I'm here?\" Kip laughed, nodding to her as he dipped; tugging her into him with her hand still in his. \"We don't like it, kid. We love it. Just like we love you . . . but we're guys. You've gotta be easy on us. Now let's go pay for this and we'll go grab your aunt and uncle okay? Your aunt's probably about to kill a few of your uncles anyway so this is probably for the best.\" Penn nodded, seeming to debate something for a moment before she wiggled loose; running straight to Memphis and throwing her arms around his knees as she sniffled. \"I'm sorry Daddy. I didn't mean it. I don't hate you-\" Memphis knelt, gathering her up in a tight hug as she started to cry; suddenly thankful that Kip had insisted on tagging along. He wouldn't have been able to handle hearing those words without another person there . . . just like he doubted he could've done as well as Kip did calming her down to see reason. Then again the longer Penn was with them the easier it was to see that she definitely took after her uncle in more than a few ways. The same infuriating ways that had left his mother grayheaded and a handful of now patched wholes in his old bedroom wall. \"I know honey, I know. Let's just not say that again okay? You only tell people you hate them if you mean it. Got it?\" She nodded, tears and snot leaching into his tee shirt as she wiped her nose on his shoulder but he didn't care. Another thing he was learning to overcome-his dislike of snot. Because Penn seemed to think everyone around her was a damned hanky. God how were they going to survive the next sixteen years?[Chapter 12] Fallout Ripley laughed as Hex made faces at Penn, neither of them caring that Memphis had let his head fall to their table or that Kip was blushing so darkly he was nearly magenta. All that mattered was the once pissy Princess of the Long Beach boosts-San and Frank's pet name for Penn when none of the Raines were around to scold them- was laughing right along with them. And not snubbing and pouting because she hadn't gotten the exact carseat that she'd had back in Avalon. Hex leaned down closer to the girl, cheeks sucked in while his eyes were crossed; his voice breaking as he tried his best to imitate a cartoon's voice as Penn cackled and clapped. She didn't have the heart to tell Hex that he just looked and sounded retarded-sure she would laugh but he expected that, the great Irish loon- or to make him stop to save what was left of the Raines' dignity. Nope. At this moment all she planned to do was keep her mouth shut and let the people around them deal with it. So Hex was being ridiculously goofy? It kept the toddler happy and quiet and that was all either of them cared about. Peace. No screaming or squalling, no whining or temper tantrums. Just happy little laughs and bright excited eyes . . . and a fair amount of spaghetti in her hair but she was two. Two year olds occasionally made a mess . . . right? Suddenly Penn stopped laughing, her eyes widening before they focused on something over Hex's shoulder; her little face becoming dangerously focused. Oh shit . She'd found something else she wanted. Ripley turned surveying the room as Hex continued to try and keep her entertained; the blonde boost using the distraction to her advantage as she scanned for whatever had caught Penn's attention. The kid had been in their lives less than a fucking week and she'd already learned that sometimes it was easier to give the adorable little monster what she wanted than to argue. Besides what kind of nut job argued with a toddler? They either did what you wanted them to or you made them-at least that's what Junie and Otto kept screaming. Ripley rolled her eyes, trying not to snort. She wasn't going to be the one to tell Penn no again until it was absolutely necessary . . . and she'd witnessed Otto caving to the cute kid enough that she knew she wasn't the only one wimping out. Now so long as the Raines brothers never found that out then all would be right in the world. Seriously what had the kid been looking at? Penn moved, lurching forward in her booster seat (God, the men would still be cackling over that if she hadn't smacked them) to wave at someone; her voice rising as she started squirming to get down. \"Mr. Sphinx! Uncle Atley!\" Ripley's head whipped around to a loud groan, spotting Sphinx looking around mid-sit as Atley let his head fall to the table much the same way Memphis had. But as she rolled her eyes and went to shush Penn something happened that made her heart clench and roll. There just beside Sphinx was an absolutely gorgeous red head, her pretty crystalline eyes wide as she looked to Atley's behavior. Sphinx ground his teeth, his left brow ticking before he pushed himself upright; nodding to Penn who had yet to stop yelling to them. The woman turned to Sphinx, laying a hand on his arm as cut her eyes between the stoic pathologist and their table; plump lips pursed in apparent distaste as she eyed Penn skeptically. Ripley watched her lean up, her whole body settling against Sphinx's arm as he leaned down to speak to her; the two deep in conversation even as Atley pulled himself out of his seat and made his way towards their spot. Rather quickly. Hex turned, raising a brow before he shrugged; leaning down to Penn with an easy going smile. \"Easy lil' bit. They 'eard ya. Lookit, Atley's comin' now.\" Penn giggled, looking to Memphis as he sat up; her grin almost blinding as she bounced in her little red plastic seat. Suddenly all of the aggravation and embarrassment from before left Memphis as he leaned forward to talk to his daughter, his eyes warm and lips spread in a true grin as he nodded to her. Penn was a great talker-God sometimes she didn't shut up despite their begging and pleading and wishing-but it was clear that she was still two. Especially since she occasionally got lost in her own sentences or would start to jabber nonsensically before she would giggle. Today however was proving to be one of her better conversational days. And God in heaven help them, she'd yet to find something she couldn't talk about. \"Look, Daddy Memphis! Uncle Atley's gonna sit with us!\" \"I know, honey. But let's try to use our inside voice . . . okay?\" Penn rolled her eyes, turning to Atley with outstretched arms as soon as he was close enough. Ripley bit her lip, keeping her eyes trained on Atley as he reached out and plucked the kid up; sinking into the empty chair beside her without any preamble or invitation. Memphis looked him over as Hex leaned back, closing his eyes as he rubbed his face; Kip occasionally glancing back to their fellow runner as he talked with the stunning red head. Not that she noticed that. \"Atley. Fancy meeting you here.\" Atley snorted, turning to glare at Sphinx over his shoulder hard before he jerked his head towards the table; his mood becoming almost toxic as Sphinx moved towards them and the woman followed. Ripley nudged him, nodding ever so discreetly towards the couple; giving Atley a pointed look. Which just caused him to grind his teeth and snort again before he reached for the alcohol menu. \"Oh don't even get me started, Raines. She's some new pathologist with his office. And apparently I'm supposed to just sit and watch her fawn all over him and try to keep what I eat down. Fuc- freaking crap is what it is!\" Memphis rolled his eyes, none of them pointing out the near slip of tongue or the sloppy recovery Jackson had made. They were just thankful he'd caught himself. Lord knows if anyone could broaden Penn's ever growing vocabulary it would be Atley. Too bad her future teachers wouldn't appreciate his efforts. Kip shifted, ducking to gossip as they duo moved closer; Ripley trying her hardest to not seem interested. But how could she not be? She and Sphinx were casual-she knew that and they both screamed it at each other enough that he knew it too. But she'd never deliberately paraded someone in front of him, always at odds if he saw her out-even if it was just an innocent coincidence. Something he couldn't claim with the way the woman was practically making him carry her to them; arm looped through hers as she kept his hand in a vice grip. And after he'd all but plainly told her that he didn't want to be out with her at all. God this was going to be hell on earth. \"So is she like his girlfriend or something? I mean why did he bring her out to eat with you two?\" Kip watched Atley snort again, rolling his eyes before he looked to Penn critically; trying to lean back as she used her index finger to push his nose up and flat. Kip grinned as Memphis and Hex chuckled, even Atley cracking a grin at what his niece said. \"Look Uncle Atley! Now you're a piggy!\" Atley's shoulders shook for a few seconds before he leveled a particularly pointed look at the toddler, his voice going hard and cool even though he seemed relaxed. Memphis tensed beside him while Hex looked torn between laughing again or grabbing the kid. But Penn was unfazed, rolling her eyes with a huff of her own as she nodded to her uncle. \"I'm no pig, kid.\" \"Then don't make piggy sounds!\" Memphis's hands came to cover his face as Hex picked up his water, taking a long drink to keep himself from laughing aloud. But as Kip turned, to push Ripley to hassle Atley with him he noticed that she wasn't even paying attention. Her eyes were solely on Sphinx, tracking his movement as he all but pushed the overdressed woman ahead of him. Kip's eyes narrowed, taking in the deeper frown on the Sphinx's face and his tensed shoulders; the way his eyes kept straying from the woman in front of him as they flickered back to Ripley. And suddenly-as Ripley finally glanced away to pat Hex's shoulder as he choked- something in his head clicked. Sphinx was probably terrified of putting this woman with the rest of them-or more to the point with Ripley . The person he sought to aggravate and hassle every chance he got. Kip rolled his eyes, leaning into Ripley as he nudged her; pulling her away from Hex and back to him. He didn't always agree with the dynamic between the two boosts but he wouldn't let Ripley do something she would hate herself for later. \"What Kip?\" He swallowed, nodding to Sphinx before he reached out and caught her hand; lacing their fingers together with a pointed look. Sphinx stilled, looking to them in seeming shock before his face grew dark; his eyes shooting to Ripley as she blushed and tried to slip away. But Kip kept her hand in his, knowing she was going to beat the hell out of him for all of this later. He just hoped the stoic ass appreciated this-because he was never going to do it again. He leaned closer, whispering to her as he squeezed her hand. \"Look, Atley's not happy about this and Penn's gonna be difficult. Let's just keep to ourselves unless we have to, okay? No need to make this any harder alright?\" Ripley looked to him like he'd grown a second head before she sighed; nodding gratefully to him as she squeezed his hand back. Kip smirked to her, nodding as he let her hand fall; turning to give Sphinx a friendly smile. Only to nearly swallow his tongue at the dower dark look the towering boost gave him. Christ what had he done wrong now? Hours later Ripley sat at her dining room table, listlessly staring at the glass of scotch she'd poured for herself as she traced the rim of the tumbler. The thick chunks of ice had already started to melt, a thin but growing layer of lighter liquid announcing that she was dangerously close to rendering her drink undrinkable. But she couldn't force herself to care; couldn't make her hand bring the cool glass to her lips or drain the sweet burning liquor that usually calmed her nerves. And all because that bitch from earlier had made her stupid little comments at the lunch table. Hex had plainly told her-when the Raines had called them to meet for lunch at the Quality Café-that he would drive so she could drink; seeing how she usually made the offer first. And before Sphinx and his entourage had crashed she hadn't even thought to order anything. Actually she'd been fine until the woman had started asking questions about their lives, leaning just a bit heavier into Sphinx-even as her eyes strayed between Atley and Hex. Which had prompted Memphis to become quiet before Kip had sprung into action; trying to keep everything light and amiable. Too bad he'd been the only one trying. Atley was insulted that Sphinx had brought the woman to begin with but he'd gotten quieter and angrier every time her eyes would flash or she would let some snotty little comment bubble forth. First she'd found the fact that Memphis, Kip and Hex were all- legally -mechanics distasteful, nodding indulgingly as she'd casually laid her hand over Sphinx's and beamed up at him. Actually her exact sentiment had been 'Oh, that sounds like such a hard line of work. Personally I don't see how you do it! I've never been able to stand the sight and smell of oil and grease but to each their own.' Ripley rolled her eyes, reaching up to push her hair out of her face as it fell; not too terribly concerned that her cheeks were damp with tears or that her hair was in a tangled rat's nest. She'd been able to handle the woman's inane chatter when Hex had started chatting her up, drowning her out as Penn had started to reach for her from Atley's lap. Ripley hadn't hesitated, scooping the squirming toddler up and dropping her in her lap; shedding her jacket in the process so she hadn't been so unbearably hot. Penn's eyes had widened at the newly exposed tattoos looping over her left shoulder and the now familiar skulls that she constantly traced whenever she held her; her cold little fingers going to smooth over the filigree and calligraphy with this excited little chirp. Kip hadn't acted fazed –neither had Atley or Memphis-but Sphinx's new little friend had gasped like she'd been hit; drawing attention from the other tables before people rolled their eyes and continued on. Ripley shifted, tugging her long sleeved sweater tighter around her; closing her eyes as she felt her cheeks burn even now. No one in their tightknit crew had ever said anything against her ink-actually they praised it more often than not any time she showed the tatted skin-but Katherine Priest was nothing like their friends. For the first time in her life Ripley had found herself feeling embarrassed over something she normally cherished. And it fucking sucked. \" Oh my word! How many tattoos do you have? \" Her eyes had gone wide, her lips parted in disbelief before she'd shaken herself; blushing as she pushed her auburn hair from her face. Sphinx had looked to her like she was crazy, one brow raised before he rolled his eyes; motioning for the waiter to bring him a drink menu as the man scuttled past them. But even as the others settled back into conversation, Hex working to try and hold a decent conversation with the entire table Priest's eyes had strayed to her tattoos more and more. Until the waiter had reappeared and asked if everyone wanted to drink after he collected their guests' orders. Then her eyes had gone from mystified terror to instant and complete disapproval; her plump lips pulled down into a dark frown as she'd shaken her head. Memphis-who was trying so desperately to recover from Penn's carseat freakout-ordered a beer without even second guessing; Kip passing since he knew he would be driving. Atley ordered his usual beer and glass of tea while Hex settled on water, nodding to her with a pointed look. So she hadn't had the best day before the Raines brothers had called . . . and she'd found out she would be spending more time in the shop than she would running the strip for the next few months with Charm's unexpected but desperately needed carpal tunnel surgery. She hadn't even thought to drink before Hex had offered but she didn't see anything wrong with the solitary glass of scotch. Before she spoke up against it anyway. \" I know this isn't any of my business but are you really going to let her drink with your daughter sitting in her lap? What kind of Mother drinks in front of their children?\" Ripley had blinked while Memphis had glared-not at her but at Priest because of the way Penn's little face fell at the thought that she might have to move. She'd thought quickly, bending to smooth Penn's hair with a warm smile; winking as the girl looked to her sheepishly. Everyone had been sure to use the \"M\" word sparingly, making certain that anytime they did Penn was nowhere in earshot. The kid had just lost her mother in every sense of the word; she didn't need to be reminded of it when they were trying to get her settled and healthy. And Ripley had found she didn't have the heart to denounce her in front of this bitch. \" I don't have to worry about Penn picking up any of my bad habits. She knows that if I tell her she shouldn't drink then she won't. Right kiddo?\" Penn had nodded her attitude nowhere near as happy as it had been before she'd turned back to Priest; her light eyes narrowed as she pouted. She crossed her arms, sinking back into Ripley as she'd glared at the woman across the table; refusing to return to Memphis or Kip even when Sphinx and Priest's food came. Insisting that she help Ripley eat the rest of her own meal. Which had led to the awkward and messy fight that ended with a pintsized handful of ziti down the now horrified Pathologist's dress before she'd grabbed Penn; dragging the cackling toddle outside to the car-though neither of them had minded. Penn had been cooped up in the house since she'd come to Long Beach and now that she had a new coveted seat she was content to ride or just sit-so long as she wasn't alone. And she'd just been thankful to get away from the drama. Memphis had come outside a few minutes later, lighting a cigarette as Penn sat in her lap in the front seat of her Chevelle. Her tiny hands swirling over the skulls at her wrist as she pouted, occasionally looking back towards the restaurant to glare before she would huff or snort. The youngest Raines had made her feel better, loudly proclaiming to both her father and the passing seagulls overhead that the woman inside was just jealous because she didn't have any pretty pictures of her own. Not like Penn did on her walls and like Ripley did on her skin. Raines had been quick to agree, offering to take Hex home if she'd just wanted to bail but she'd refused; stealing a quick pull from his cigarette before she'd walked back inside with the father and daughter. She just hadn't finished her own meal, feeding Penn bits and pieces since the kid had decided her and Memphis's plates were empty enough and Kip's food was too spicy. And she'd let her scotch sit there and go warm, the ice melting to the point that the one drink she'd taken had been horrid. She sighed, wiping at her face again as she pushed to her feet; picking up the glass and moving towards the sink to toss it when a knock on her door made her stop. She hesitated before tossing the drink, rinsing out the glass and allocating the bottle back to its designated spot before she went to open the door. Lord, she'd better not let them know she drank at home or they might try to send her AA. She snorted, rolling her eyes before she opened the door; only to flinch at what was waiting on her. Sphinx pushed past her into her home without invitation, reaching out and slamming the door shut before she had the chance to close it. He ran a hand down his face, moving towards the table before he stopped; turning to her with a brow raised. \"I can't believe you're not drinking-not after that shite today.\" Ripley glared, fists balling and clenching before she shook herself; motioning back towards the door. She knew it was childish and stupid, that she was the one responsible for her hurt feelings but Sphinx hadn't helped her either. Not once during the woman's little comments or looks about her tattoos had he even hinted that he ran his hands over them more often than not. That he had pushed and prodded until she'd let him take his own inventory of every mark on her skin. Sure that had been when everything between them had been new and exciting, when he'd found his way to her door less often than he did now but had always been eager to see her. No, all of that was on him. Too bad for him she'd had enough of it. \"Why does it matter, Sphinx? I don't have to drink to cope with the things in my life-and I don't appreciate the insinuation that I do.\" Sphinx flinched, looking to her before he shook his head; reaching up to smooth his hand over the back of his head. He looked embarrassed, like he hadn't expected her to say anything and didn't know how to act now that she had. But why would he? She'd been right in her statement the day before; all they ever did was boost, fight and fuck. He didn't know anything about her-because she kept to herself unless they were boosting, fucking or fighting and he didn't seem too interested in bothering to know her period. She moved, running her hands down her face before she shook her head; suddenly too tired and weary to deal with all of this. \"Girlie I-\" She waved him off, moving to open the door; keeping her eyes away from his as her hand landed on the knob. She had never sent him away before, had always just swallowed whatever bothered her and gone along with his plans for the evening. And while that was her own stupid fault she wasn't doing it tonight. Not when all she wanted to do was curl up and cry herself to sleep. She'd known he had other lovers, that he'd carried on other flings in between theirs but she'd never actually seen one of them. And now that she had she'd realized what a losing battle she'd been caught up in. Katherine Priest had been a bitch and half but she'd also been jaw-dropping. How could she not be with her smooth skin and perfect features; her tailored clothes and pristine PhD that she'd gloated about for damn near twenty minutes? God she'd been contending with women like that? It was a wonder Sphinx ever came back to her at all, much less as often as he did. \"Just don't, okay? It's been a long bad day and I really don't-I can't deal with all of this alright?\" Sphinx stilled, looking to her before he sighed; reaching out to catch her hand in his. She let him, looking up at him through her lashes; trying not to notice the difference in the way he touched her. Christ how had she been so fucking stupid? Even Kip's little touch earlier had been more caring than this. Sphinx seemed like he was trying to placate her, like he didn't want to touch her but he knew he had to. Well she had news for him; he didn't have to, not anymore. \" Ripley , there's nothin' to deal with. What happened today was-\" She pulled away, reaching up and threading her fingers through her curls; her eyes watering even as she fought to keep herself together. She wasn't going to do this. She wasn't going to let him see just how bad all of this tore her up. Because the second he saw he did he would hold it over her, the same as anyone else save maybe Atley and the Raines brothers. Hell even Hex had never seen her cry and he'd seen her drunk enough to brawl. \"Today was fucked up. But it's alright because I needed it. I needed the wakeup call.\" Sphinx looked to her, eyes troubled as he shook his head; stepping closer as he caught her wrists. Slowly he eased her hands out of her hair, using her arms to tug her to him; dipping to press his lips to her knuckles. He looked at her over her hands, keeping her close even as she tried to pull away. \"You're fine , Girlie. I wouldn't be here if you weren't.\" She took in a shuddering breathe, looking to him before she shook her head; trying to ease back. This was too much. She understood what he was trying to do, the attempt meaning more than it should but she could also tell he wasn't comfortable with it. He didn't want to be here doing this but here he was-which meant that whatever else had probably fallen through. \"Yes, you would. You always come here when whatever or whoever else doesn't pan out. I mean that's practically the definition of casual right? The backup plan for when the real plans don't quite cut it.\" Sphinx let his hands fall, looking to her like she was insane before his face darkened; his shoulders tensing as he glared down at her. He stepped closer, catching her arms hard as he tugged her into his chest; dipping to where their noses almost touched. \"You don't know me, Girl. So don't play like you do-\" She growled, jerking free as she pushed him back; the action surprising him so much that he actually staggered back and into her table. But she didn't care. She'd dealt with all of this comments and quips, had taken all of his bullshit in stride and still tried to be with him as much as he'd let her. And he went and did this? \"You're right, I don't. But it's not because I haven't tried. I mean I've tried to talk to you, tried to get to know you but you've never wanted anything to do with it! And when you do act like maybe-just maybe you might want more out of me than a passing fuck you don't come back for weeks!\" He stopped, looking to her before he sighed; raking his hands over his face. \"I told you from the start that I didn't want anything permanent, Ripley-and you agreed. Said the same damn thing-\" She moved towards the door, jerking it open again as she glared at him; pointing towards her driveway to his Malibu. She had agreed to this bullshit a year and a half ago but now she wanted more. She wanted to find the kind of relationship she'd always sworn off; wanted to see if maybe she could find her own happiness-however short lived it might turn out to be. She wanted what Sway and Memphis had-before everything went to shit. And she when she found it she would destroy anyone or thing that tried to tear it to pieces. But she couldn't do that until she did this . . . and as hard as it was she was going to do it. \"I did want that- then. But I want more now. And you want her so this is where we are. Get out .\" Sphinx growled, glaring at her as he screamed; his voice nearly shaking the windows as he threw his arms up and out. He was exasperated and angry but Ripley was just awed. This was the most emotion she'd ever seen out of him, the most human and concerned he'd ever seemed when he'd been with her. And while it gave her a fleeting ray of hope that maybe she had meant something more she knew he would never admit to it. Just like as soon as he got bored or angry he would be gone again. \"I don't fucking want her! Bloody hell woman are you that daft?! I've sought you out steadily for over a fucking year! I want you!\" Ripley stretched to her full height, keeping her chin up even as her eyes began to water. At the first sign of tears all of the anger left him, his hands falling listlessly to his sides as he just watched her; eyes wide and disbelieving. Like he was amazed she could actually cry. She leaned a little heavier against her door, refusing to back down now that she'd started. This wasn't healthy-for either of them- and she was tired of hurting; of never knowing where she stood or how the people around her felt. She'd isolated herself as a means of protection and made her own prison, her own cute little corner of hell. Well starting today she was breaking out of it . And if Sphinx wanted to be left behind then that was his own damn fault. \"But you don't. You want me right now- for a few hours or days but my problem always comes when you don't. When you have your fill of whatever it is you get from being here and then go back to your life. Go back to ignoring me unless you're being cruel and sarcastic, to listening to the only person whose shared my bed in nearly two fucking years tell me how worthless I am or how much of an inconvenience it is to be around me.\" He shook his head, looking to her like she was crazy. \"Christ Ripley. The others-\" She snorted, shaking her head as she wiped at her eyes; angry that she'd started crying to begin with. \" Fuck the others, Sphinx. This isn't about anyone or anything but you. You don't want a real relationship. You don't want anyone to know that we've been together-that's all you . And I'm tired of it. I want something with you but I can't keep doing this. I won't. Now- please . Just leave.\" He stood there for a few long heartbeats, looking to her like she was insane before he sighed; moving to step towards the door like he was headed to the gallows. But just as she thought he would pass through it to leave he caught her hands; carefully tugging them from their spots on the glossy teal wood before he looped his fingers through hers. He tugged her into him, wrapping his free arm around her back as he settled her against his chest. Ripley didn't move, didn't dare breath until he dipped; resting his chin on the crown of her curls as he kept her tight against him. \"You're more than a passing fancy, Ripley-you always were. And though I know you don't believe it right now I aim ta prove it. I'm going tonight but I promise you we're going to finish this.\" He pulled away after a moment, dipping to skim his lips against her cheek before he moved through the open door. Ripley sagged against the door, watching him cross her yard to his Malibu almost in a daze; trying to piece together what had just happened. Because for the life of her she couldn't believe that he'd just promised to push into the very thing he'd railed against not even five minutes before. She reached up, her fingers grazing her still warm cheek; her eyes following him as he pulled away. He was just as fucking crazy as she was. Christ what in the hell did she do now? No one kill me . . . i swear it all serves a purpose.[Chapter 13] Charred Ripley ran her hands over her face, trying not to yawn as she poured over design books and some of her older sketchbooks. She'd had a client come in towards the end of her shift, requesting a very elaborate chest piece . . . and she was about at her wit's end trying to put the man's concept onto paper. God if she couldn't get this then how in the hell could she transfer this from pencil and paper to skin and ink? She shifted, reaching up to shake her hair free as she pushed to her feet; stretching as she finally gave into temptation and yawned. A knock on her door made her stop mid-stretch, turning to the teal French doors wearily before she sighed. She knew that with it being as late as it was-well past three in the morning the last time she'd checked forever ago-that it could only be a handful of people. And she didn't really want to deal with any of them. She hadn't talked to Sphinx since her blow up at the garage and then in her home, too embarrassed and mortified to answer any of the calls or texts the man had sent her since she'd all but run him out of her home. She still didn't know exactly what to do for Memphis, who had come to her wanting to know if she could do some sort of tattoo of Penn-something for himself and his daughter that he could always keep close. She knew that -while the gesture itself was sweet and solely for Penn-Memphis would get as much from it as his daughter, it was as much to start to atone for the fact that he hadn't been there the first portion of her life. Not that he would admit to it aloud, of course. A second knock made her jump, her cheeks flushing as she hurried to answer her visitor. God she really was having some kind of meltdown to stand in the middle of her living room day dreaming instead of answering the damn door! She passed her couch, moving up the two small steps to the foyer before she undid the locks; tugging the door back to reveal one of the last people she'd ever expected to see at her house this early in the morning. Char Rivers had run with her brother, the two forming the tightly knit crew that had become their family before everything had fallen apart. And his shit stain of a brother had rolled on them once he'd found out Char was still boosting. She stepped back, letting the towering boost step inside as he nodded to her; looking around seemingly impressed before he gave her a tired smile. She sighed, closing the door as he shifted on his feet; not even hesitating to step into him when he opened his arms to her. God she'd missed him. He tugged her closer, wrapping his arms as tightly around her as he could; sighing into her hair as they almost sagged against one another. She felt his lips press against the crown of her curls just like she was sure he heard her mangled little hitch of breath. She appreciated the tight squeeze he gave before he let her step back just like she knew he was thankful for the way her hands came up and traced his face; her fingers moving slowly over the bullet wound to his left cheek before they skittered over his head to feel the exit wound at the base of his skull. How in the hell he'd survived that she had no clue but he had, the bullet skimming along the curve of his skull before it had exited right above his neck . . . And all because he'd jumped in front of Khail when another runner had pulled a gun on them years before. She stretched to her tiptoes, pressing a long sweet kiss to the corner of his lips; thankful that he didn't point out that she was crying. Or that he didn't pull away from her the way he would have years before. Char had been her brother's best friend but in their time together he had become her rock; her one true sounding board and confidant aside from Paul. Watching him go down the year before Khail, refusing to roll even when he'd been offered a reduced sentence and cushy side deal had been hard. But nowhere near as hard as it had been for him-the felon brother of a boy scout cop tossed in general population. Char chuckled, reaching down to wipe away her tears; his warm calloused thumbs scratching at her face but she didn't care. He had acquired more ink, most of his arms and what little of his chest she could see covered in the dark mars of prison ink. \"Hey Chaos.\" Ripley blushed, glaring at him before she sighed; leaning into his chest as he hugged her again. His fingers smoothed over her back, trailing soothingly up and down her spine as she balled her fists in his tank top. He'd been out almost a year, only calling her to let her know he was breathing and wouldn't try to contact her until he was sure he wasn't being watched. So for him to show up like this, unannounced and at this hour meant one of two things. Either he'd finally managed to slip his leash and was on his own recognizance or something had happened to her brother. Char chuckled again, the gravely sound taking her back to a million cook outs and bonfires; to boosts and lazy days when life hadn't been easy but it had been so much better. \"I know, I know. You hate that name . . . always did think it was pretty though. Guess you've gotta be wondering why I'm here. Right?\" She nodded, not trusting her voice as she held her breath; waiting for the other shoe to drop. The kind of days she'd had lately he could be here to tell her that Khail had been jumped in prison-again. But he just sighed, keeping her still as he started; his arms the only thing that kept her upright as she finally started to cry. Of all the things she could've ever hoped for this wasn't one of them. \"Well I just got word that Khail's probation has been signed off on-despite the shit Mars tried to pull to prevent it. He's due to be released in about two months. I uh figured you'd want to know first . . . and that now would be as good a time as any to do this.\" She looked up, not anticipating the way he caught her face in his hands; laying his forehead against hers as he ran his nose down hers. Or the soft, heartfelt words that tore right through her. None of them had ever blamed Char for what had happened. They had known from the second they'd met the Rivers that Mars was sketchy . . . and the second he'd enrolled in the academy they'd all pulled away from him to protect themselves. But Char had been his blood, trying to be the good big brother and support his family-even when it came back to bite him in the ass time and again. She knew for fact that he hadn't spoken to his brother since his arraignment, that other than the crew and his cellmate he'd kept to himself to stay breathing. He didn't need to do this. \"I am so sorry, kid. About how things went down. I tried to take as much of the wrap as I could; told those cocksuckers that I didn't work with a crew. I swear on your mother that I-\" Ripley reached up, covering his mouth before he could continue; shaking her head at him as she laughed. \"Honey I know . I went to the trials; I read through the evidence with the lawyers and saw the witness testimony. I know you never gave us up-even when your brother pushed you to. I know that. Khail and the others know that.\" Char closed his eyes, nodding before he stepped away; all of the emotion and rawness fading as he looked around her home. He glanced back, raising a brow. \"I was kind of confused when Otto gave me this address for you. Thought Khail said you stayed in the old house?\" She shook her head, rubbing her arm sheepishly. \"No . . . after Mom passed away I just couldn't stay there alone. I mean I still have it-pay the property taxes and all but I can't stay there. I figure it'll give Khail a place to go when he gets out . . . Guess I'd better start getting it together huh?\" Char snorted, shaking his head. \"No. The rotten bastard can help us when he gets out. You do too much and we'll never hear the end of it. Speaking of which, you don't mind that I'm probably going to move in with him right? I can only stand so much apartment living before I get edgy. Too many damn eyes and ears.\" She laughed, shrugging as she shook her head. \"Not in the least, Char. You're family . . . besides Mom did give you your own room like what? Twelve years ago?\" He rolled his eyes, reaching up to straighten his shirt before he crossed to her coffee table; eying the pictures with interest before he sank into her couch with an exaggerated sag. She smirked, dropping beside him as she pulled the sketchpad and reference pictures into her lap; the sharpie pen hanging from her fingertips as she began to explain her issue with the piece. Char looked over the art, eyes scanning everything critically before he took the pen; making crude thick lines to illustrate what he began explaining. \"You're close kid but you need to do this . . . Connect these lines and do away with the stupid background shit. And frame everything together with something simple. Let the main part of the piece be the actual focal point-then worry about incorporating the rest of this shit. Who the hell wants something like this anyway?\" She shrugged, turning to lay her head on his shoulder; closing her eyes as he took over the sketch. Occasionally muttering as he worked in the elements she had listed to the side. Little by little the crude lines became polished, an image springing forth from the seeming mess of scratches and ink as she felt Char's shoulders relax and his whole attitude just mellowed. It was easy to sit here and pretend that they were just working on something together the way they had before. That he was teaching her some trick before they went into the shop together tomorrow . . . and that the past ten years hadn't happened. She shifted, cracking an eye as she watched him sketch; hating that his own kin had been the one to take everything from him. Oh sure, he'd been breaking the law but Mars had crossed a line few dared to. Blood was supposed to be thicker than oaths and water, the one true thing you clung to in a world that would swallow you whole-soul and all. And while she could understand his point-see that he was trying to do what was good and honest and lawful she'd never be able to overlook that he'd crucified his brother to make a name for himself. Just like she would never forget that Char was the one who drug her into Charm's shop all of those years ago and declared he was taking her on as an intern. Ripley bit her lip, looking up at him before she reached out and laid her hand over his; stilling the pen. Char turned to her, brow raised before his cheeks flushed; his chin dipping as he reached up and rubbed the back of his head with his free hand sheepishly. \"Jeez. Sorry Kid. I just kinda took over and-\" She squeezed his hand, giving him a warm smile before she shrugged; keeping her hand over his. \"Come in with me tomorrow morning. Talk to Charm before he goes out for his next surgery. We could use the extra help and I know for fact that no one would care that you're fresh out, you know? Hell, I'll give you my next three shifts just so I can get the littlest Raines squared away.\" Char stayed deathly still for a few long moments before he swallowed loudly, tilting his head just the slightest bit as he looked her over. \"You really think that'll fly? Cause I gotta tell you, working down at the docks for next to nothing is fucking bullshit.\" Ripley nodded, squeezing his hand again as she smiled. She knew Charm wouldn't have a problem-hell he'd asked her if Char was interested in coming back before he'd ever been paroled. And it would be nice to have him close again. Almost as nice as seeing her brother. \"I'm positive. You wanna take the couch? You can follow me in tomorrow morning-You know in like, three hours.\" Char grinned, shrugging before he nodded to her. He moved, tossing his arm over her shoulders with a lazy smile; chuckling to himself as he shook his head. \"Damnation you drive a hard bargain kid . . . but why not? Not like I have anything better to do anyway. You know anything about what happened to my guns and kit?\" She nodded, pushing off of the couch to go towards the closet in her bedroom. She'd taken all of their kits when the cops had picked them up, tucking them away beneath her mother's kitchen floorboards to hide until the heat had died down. After her mother's wake and her move she'd brought the kits with her, tossing them in old shoeboxes at the top of her closet-along with Char's tattoo guns and Kobe's small family blades. Hell she even had Raze's favorite movies and books hidden away beneath her bed in storage boxes with Reese's laptop. She smiled to herself, finally feeling the weight that had settled on her start to lift; her world finally starting to turn and realign itself to something that resembled what it had been. It was good to see some of the things in her life start to come back to rights . . . even if it wasn't what she'd hoped for. Meet Char![Chapter 14] Just for Midnight . . . Because seriously the idea wouldn't leave me alone. Envy Ripley sighed, stretching quickly before she scurried through her kitchen; running a hand down her face as she fought to wake up. She'd known better than to pull an all-nighter but she'd done it anyway, using the excuse of the tattoo concept to spend as much time with Char as she could. She moved to the furthest counter, hitting START on the coffee pot without ever thinking; pulling down two of her larger mugs before she started towards the living room. Char had finally run her off to bed around five thirty, stretching himself out on her sofa and reclaiming her oldest throw as her own. She stopped just behind her arm chair, brow raised as she watched him snore; one arm tossed over his eyes while the other hung limply from the sofa. His legs were bent at the knee; one ankle over the arm while the led hung off the couch-same as his arm. But what got her was how at ease he seemed . . . and how loud he snored. She shook her head, scanning the room for a second before she grabbed one of her fluffier pillows; taking aim and tossing it straight at his head. The pillow struck true, his last interrupted snore sounding more like a snort as he shot up from the cushions; looking around wildly before his eyes landed on her. She bit her lip, fightin back her giggles as the confusion melted from his features; his brows and lips setting in a deep scowl before he rolled his eyes. He turned, picking the pillow up and chucking it at her; making her squeal as she ducked to avoid it. He pushed off the couch, flicking the side of her head before he looped his arms over her shoulder; leading them both towards the kitchen. \"Too damn early for this shit. And you didn't use to be a morning person-what in the hell's happened to you, kid?\" Ripley leaned into his side, beaming up at him as he began to grouse; steering her towards the mugs and coffee while she giggled. Of course Char would remember her life long love affair with sleep; with how she refused to get out of bed until she'd absolutely had to while she was in college and interning with him at the shop. Hell more than a few times he'd driven just so she could sleep through the fifteen minute trip; squeezing as much precious sleep into her day before it started as she could. But that had been a lifetime ago . . . and being the only person to care for her mother's health and to ensure that everything around them-bills, groceries, work, boosting, getting her Mom to and from appointments- was all taken care of had taught her to be an early riser. Sure she was still as pissy for the first few minutes but after that she pushed through. Besides it wasn't like there was anyone who usually saw her first thing in the morning. Even Sphinx didn't spend the night-the few times he had drifted off before her always ended in any empty bed the next morning. She shook herself, refusing to dwell on that particular train of thought. Sphinx claimed to be willing for more but they hadn't been around one another long enough for him to prove it. And until she was one hundred percent sure about his intentions she wasn't going to gift him with an abundance of opportunities. He'd had over a year and a half-damn near twenty months to make a move . . . and she was tired of all the games and secrecy if he wasn't being sincere. Life was too fucking short for that nonsense. \"A lot, my favorite Charlatan. But I don't have the time or desire to go into all of it. You ready to head out?\" He shrugged, letting her step away to fill their cups as the coffee pot dinged; leaning against the counter as he watched the pot like a hawk. She grinned, shaking her head. Khail and Char had always fought over the first cup; bickering and picking-and occasionally rough housing until someone would emerge victorious. While the loser was often covered in half of the first cup for the their troubles. She knew it was childish but the small silly contest was just another trivial thing she'd missed since they'd both been away. \"I got time to grab a shower real quick? I think I have a clean shirt in the trunk.\" Ripley nodded, pushing him towards the bedroom beyond the kitchen; following to show him the towels tossed in her makeshift linen closet. She grabbed two, pushing them into his hands as she started pulling out the ancient bottles of soap tucked beneath her sink. Being bald Char wouldn't really need much in the way of shampoo but she knew he would need soap. Just like she was sure he didn't want to smell like peonies and vanilla all day-despite how much fun she could have with it. She turned, handing him the bottle of spearmint eucalyptus bodywash; rolling her eyes at his raised brow while she fought the urge to blush. She knew he was one of her oldest friends but seriously did he have to give her that look? She was an adult now-had been for a very longtime. And it wasn't too weird that she kept a spare bottle of soap just in case whoever needed to shower before they left . . . Okay maybe it was a little odd but damn it she was trying to be nice here! \"If you don't want it feel free to use mine. I'm sure Charm won't say anything if you come in smelling like Bath & Body Works.\" Char rolled his eyes, taking the soap with a nod before he stepped through the red painted door into her bathroom; his whistle echoing as he shut the door behind him. She grinned again, covering her mouth as she heard him mutter to himself. At least he could appreciate all of the hard work she'd put into her home. \"Damnation kid, I might never leave this bathroom. Scratch a shower-I'm taking a damn bath.\" She laughed, turning to go back into the kitchen when she spotted the laundry basket tucked beside her sink; brows furrowing when she noticed a dark button down shirt on top of her other clothes. She picked it up, inspecting it with a raised brow before she rolled her eyes; tossing it across her bed as she huffed. Seriously? Sphinx usually acted like he couldn't wait to leave but he actually left one of his shirts? She glanced back, biting her lip before she shook it off; refusing to even entertain the passing thought that maybe he'd actually meant what he said. He'd just forgotten the shirt earlier in the week . . . and if she ever saw him without the others around she would let him know. But other than that she needed to keep her distance. Now where in the hell was her phone? Because if she'd lost it again Atley would skin her. Atley grumbled, taking the turn onto Pelican Drive a little wider-faster- than he should have. He didn't glance at his passenger, too harried and irritated to care if Sphinx minded being tossed around the car like a crash dummy. He'd been trying to call Ripley all morning, to let her know that Cacuzza had sent word to him about her brother but he kept getting her voicemail. Which meant she was either asleep-unlikely with her insomniac ways-, busy at work- another no go seeing as how he'd called the shop and no one had seen her- or she had company. And he was really hoping it was the later; because he'd been waiting to at least see the man who kept her so at odds. \"God if something isn't wrong and she's just being weird I'm gonna kick her scrawny little ass.\" Sphinx snorted beside him only to have to stead himself as they took the next turn a little too sharply, the taller boost bringing his left foot up to brace against his dash as they slid onto the next road. Sphinx glared at him before he sighed, smoothing his hair back into place even as he shook his head. \"She's fine, Jackson. Pro'lly forgot to charge her phone. Again . You know how she loses the damn thing if she isn't on it.\" Atley nodded as he slowed to turn into her driveway, stopping in the middle of the road as a thought hit him. He turned, looking to Sphinx skeptically. He'd already thought it was odd that Sphinx hadn't fought coming with him to check on Ripley-not that he would've refused to come but some resistance was almost expected. And this was the second time in twenty minutes he'd made some random comment about how it was probably nothing. Sphinx shifted motioning to the house; arm outstretched as he glanced around the road glaring at Atley like he was insane. But Jackson couldn't shake the feeling that his friend really wasn't as bothered to be here as he should be . . . And how did he know that Ripley was constantly losing her cell-when she wasn't tossing them at walls or people? \"What the Hell, Atley? Are you gonna pull in or not? That's her driveway is it not?\" Atley leaned back, nodding before he turned to pull in. Only to feel the blood in his veins run ice cold at what was waiting on them. There parked behind Ripley's Chevelle like it belonged there was a vehicle he hadn't expected; one that he knew didn't need to be anywhere near the girl or their crew because of who owned it. Or rather the owner's crazy cop brother. He clenched his teeth, glaring at the pristine black 1970 Plymouth GTX 440 wasn't exactly common to find around Long Beach-especially not with the level of care Char had taken with it. Oh he'd told him not to do this! To stay away from her until he was sure it was safe for the kid to be around him and what did he do? Come right to her fucking home! Oh this wasn't going to do- not at all! Atley pulling up the driveway and off to the side, parking on the sandy grass before he cut the engine. Sphinx turned to him as he tossed his door open; leaving his keys in the ignition as he fought his way out of the deathtrap his seatbelt became. The stoic boost sighed, reaching over and undoing the catch; giving him a pointed look. \"What's all this about Jackson? Who's bloody car is that?\" Atley growled to himself, out of the car before Sphinx had the chance to ask his next question, making the man sigh and throw the door open; slamming it in his hurry to catch up to him. Sphinx kept pestering him as they powerwalked up the walkway; his questions becoming more persistent as they cleared the steps to her porch in seconds. They stopped before Ripley's door, Sphinx looking to him like he was crazy-until a laugh from behind the door made him stop. \"Honestly Atley you're beginning to worry me. What in the hell is-\" Sphinx's face became dangerously dark, the taller boost moving to bang on the door harder than necessary. Atley watched as the lavender blonde boost opened the door, her cheeks flushed and a smile on her lips despite the irritation coloring her eyes; only to pale when she saw Sphinx glaring down at her. She opened her mouth to speak when Sphinx practically pushed past her; his tone cold and dark as he rounded on her. Ripley however didn't cower the way she probably should have, glaring back up at him as she crossed her arms. \"What in the hell is going on, Girlie? You can't answer a phone but you can run around here all morning laughing and squealing-\" \"It isn't any of your damned business what I was doing, you smug sonofabitch. And why do you care if I'm not answering calls?\" Sphinx dipped, glowering at her as she stretched; meeting him head on as he seethed. \"Because people have been trying to call you all bloody morning! To pass on news and to fucking check on you-not that you seem to care !\" \"Oh-ho! That's fucking rich! I don't care?! Don't you mean you?! \" She snorted, rolling her eyes as she turned; glancing back into her kitchen as they heard movement. Sphinx's face darkened even more, the expression on his face promising something a bloody violent death while Ripley just looked to him like he was insane. But Atley Jackson was beginning to see that a lot of things in his world were fucking crazy. He went to speak, to try and clear up whatever in the hell was happening here when Char stepped into the kitchen; head ducked as he used the towel over his bare shoulders to wipe the water from his face and neck. The other boost didn't stop automatically, talking to Ripley as he moved towards the coffee pot; seemingly oblivious to the other people in the room. \"Hey Kid? You about ready to go? I know I already made you late but as soon as I grab a shirt I swear I'm ready.\" Sphinx turned to Ripley, eyes blazing as she glared at him; answering Char's question as she slammed her door shut. The sound brought Char's face up, his eyes narrowing before he shrugged; nodding to both of them as he leaned against the counter. He finished drying his chest and neck, turning back to Ripley expectantly. Like he wasn't doing a damned thing wrong by being here . . . \"Its fine, Char. Take your time. I apparently have to suffer through another retard moment with the mental midget here.\" Sphinx growled, opening his mouth to speak when Atley pushed him back; stepping between them as he started waving his arms. \"Jesus! Stop it, stop it! Enough alright?! You two hate each other-we all know it! Do you mind stopping the stupid feud long enough for me to do what I set out to?\" Sphinx huffed but waved him on, moving to drop onto the sofa with a decided pout as Ripley continued to glare at him. Sphinx crossed his arms, refusing to look at them as he grunted and grumbled; Ripley's eyes widening as outright stared at him. \"And to think I'm giving up my peace and quiet for this shite.\" Atley shook his head, moving out to catch Ripley by the shoulder as she moved towards the still grumbling boost; her fists balled as she ground her teeth. He watched her for a second, sighing heavily when she finally seemed to calm down enough not to go after the glowering giant behind them; though she still seemed to think she could set him ablaze by glaring at him. \"Hey- HEY! I didn't come here for you two to start up, okay? I got news from Cacuzza early this morning and I know you'd want to know. He came along because-Oh hell I don't why he came along but he did alright? So stop bitching and bickering and listen. Luka says the word's come down-Khail is gonna get to walk away early sometime soon. Next couple of months, if that long.\" Ripley's shoulders sagged as she nodded, motioning back to Char as he took a sip of his coffee; the gruff boost nodding to her with a shit eating grin. Sphinx growled under his breath, Ripley turning back to him with an exasperated look; throwing her hands up in frustration. \"Thank you Atley-for coming to tell me but I already know. Char stopped by last night to break the news . . . Christ Sphinx, really!? Stop growling! What are you, a dog or something?!\" Char raised a brow as the Sphinx snorted and rolled his eyes; sinking deeper in the couch as he refused to look in Ripley's direction in favor of glaring at him over Atley's shoulder. Jackson glanced back to Char, all of the anger he'd come in with seemingly gone as they shared a puzzled look; Ripley still looking to the glowering growling man expectantly. He knew he was out of the loop with a lot but what in the hell was going on here? Sphinx didn't disappoint, shifting on the couch as he finally cut his eyes to the girl; the possessive glint there making Char's hackles rise on their own. He'd seen plenty of other runners look at the kid like over the years, had busted more than a few heads of people too stupid to understand the word no but something about this was off. Different. This wasn't like when he and Khail had threatened to gut Frankie the Fish the first time the jerk had met her or even close to the arrogant Casanovas she'd occasionally played with. No this was more, almost territorial . . . but the question was why? It was no secret that Ripley and Sphinx had never quite gotten along; always bickering and picking with one another even when the other runner had refused to say a word. But now that he thought about it Khail had always pushed it aside, claiming that he knew the man would never actually hurt her-despite the warnings he liked to dole out to his sister. Had Khail picked up on something the rest of them had missed? \"Just trying to figure out how I get the riot act for Priest but you're fine to do this.\" Ripley growled, pulling away from Atley as she moved to stand right in front of him; dipping to where their noses almost touched as she started bitching at him. Because Char had seen the kid at both her best and worst-and there wasn't any other way to describe this but bitching. She didn't seem to care that they had an audience-or that Jackson looked dangerously close to a stroke. No all she wanted was for the man glaring at her to see her point. \"Priest insulted our friends- your friends! And made it her mission to point out how unladylike I was every chance she got! Both before and after she hurt Penn's feelings! And I wasn't going to say anything to you about that- you brought it up! Right before you slunk off to do whatever it is you do when you're not around!\" Sphinx's jaw clenched, the sound of teeth grinding against each other almost audible as he glowered up at her. \"I didn't slink off, Girl-you tossed me out on my arse. And don't even try to pretend that I've called you a thousand fucking times and you haven't answered!\" She laughed, the sound sarcastic and grating as she looked at him like he was crazy; her eyes wide and mouth hanging open before she shook herself. \"Golly gee I wonder why?! Who in their right mind wants to have this conversation when they don't have to! Why would I subject myself to this for no fucking reason other than you're bored-\" Char watched the Sphinx closely as he pushed to his feet, glaring at her before he pushed by her; slamming the door as he made his way out into the yard without so much as another word. Atley turned to Ripley, giving her a beseeching look before he sighed; shaking his head. \" DAMN IT! This isn't how I wanted this to go! What in the hell is he talking about?! He's tried to call you? Over the shit at lunch the other day?\" Ripley waved him off, reaching up to run her hands down her face as she growled into her palms. Char chuckled, taking steady measured steps as he moved behind her; handing her his half full cup of coffee before he slung an arm over her shoulders. Jackson flinched when she leaned into him, taking the cup and downing the rest before she shuddered; looking to the mug then back to him. \"You know what, Atley ask him. Because if he's really serious about this bullshit then he'll tell you. And if he isn't then I really don't want anyone else to know. Christ Char what did you put in that? Dead cat?\" He shrugged, taking the cup back before he nudged her towards the back of her house. She rolled her eyes but went, grumbling to herself as she pushed through her kitchen and back into her bedroom. \" This is bullshit ! Sent to my room in my own damn house .\" Char chuckled before he turned back to Jackson, straightening as the man's exasperation melted back into the cold wrath he'd seen before. He tossed the empty mug up, careful to keep any of the surving coffee droplets from hitting the ground as he watched Jackson glare at him. Christ, no wonder he and Khail had gotten on so damned good. They were both crazy as fuck . . . and could make you want to spill all of your secrets just to stop them from glaring at you. \"I take it you're pissed I'm here, right?\" Atley snorted, burying both hands into his hair before he shrugged; shifting on his feet. \"At first yeah but now I'm just pissed she didn't answer the phone. And that apparently the two people I see the most are hiding something from me and everyone else! *SIGH* She said anything to you about this shit?\" Char shrugged, deciding not to bring Jackson into the fold. Khail would hear about all of this before the end of the day-from someone he was sure but he wasn't about to rat the kid out to anyone in her new crew. Especially since he wasn't a hundred percent sure what he would be ratting about. \"Not yet-though I expect to get an earful on our way to the shop.\" Atley stilled, seeming stunned before he nodded; his shoulders relaxing just enough that he didn't seem about ready to snap his own neck. \"Oh . . . So you're going back to charm's? How's that gonna work out with everything else? I mean, the cops know you worked there before when you ran-\" Char waved him off, shrugging again. It wasn't any of Jackson's business if he decided to boost again but he wasn't about to let the man give him any lip about picking up where he left off. If anything the less he knew the safer they all were. It was a hard learned lesson but he would keep to it. \"Charm's fine with it and I'm not going back into the life-not anytime soon. Besides, Mars and I haven't spoken in years so if he starts pushing buttons he doesn't have anything to push with. Charm's going out for some surgery and the kid's gonna need the help-with only two other people in the shop . . . and it's gonna be nice to do something normal. You don't have a problem with that, right Jackson?\" Atley was still for a few long moments before he nodded, extending his hand with as friendly of a smile as he ever gave. \"No man. No problem at all. Just be careful alright? She's family. And I'd hate to see anything happen to her because any of us got careless.\" Char took the offered hand, giving Jackson's knuckles an extra pointed squeeze before he let him go. \"Oh trust me Atley, I get it. But you don't need to worry about me. Now the big sonofabitch pouting outside might have a few broken bones coming his way if he talks to her like that again but again -that won't be coming from just me.\" And next time Penn![Chapter 15] Ripley and Raines and the Flea Market. What else is there to say? Fleas Ripley bit her lip, trying not to grin as Memphis looked over the rows of furniture tucked beneath the tin awning. The eldest member of Raines family was awed by the San Jose flea market, constantly getting distracted by the plethora of odds and ends scattered over table tops and in bins. Raines turned, the widening of blue eyes letting her know that she'd better keep up with him. Or she was going to have to go to the office and page him. Again. One would think that an infamous boost would be able to keep his bearings in a simple outdoor market but apparently Randal Raines sense of direction died a horrible bloody death the second he was out of a car. And she was tired of trying to keep her eye on him and look for suitable furniture for Penn. She rolled her eyes, moving to follow Raines as he turned; heading towards a stall three rows down with blinking lights and car memorabilia hanging off of the sides. God could this idiot not break away from their stereotypical boost personas long enough to help find his daughter a bed?! Sure she thought that the old Cadillac signs and Ford Mustang hubcaps were just as great as he did but they needed to stay on task. Now once they found furniture for their resident princess then they could spend the rest of the day browsing through the junk. But as she opened her mouth to speak her eyes landed on something that was all too perfect. There above a dozen boxes of die cast cars and a random assortment of spare parts were two tin signs that she couldn't pass up even if she wanted to. One was a faded tin dealership ad, a pristine blue 70 Chevelle Malibu parked on a sunny strip while a positively ravishing pinup girl was seated on the hood. Smiling coyly as she winked, her black sixties styled bathing suit displaying plentiful curves while her blonde curls were swept over her shoulder. The car itself was a year younger than the one she was thinking of but it was close enough that its owner would appreciate the gesture. Especially since Chevelle memorabilia was getting harder to stumble across. Everyone who had one seemed determined to turn them into Low-riders or dope cars-something she and Sphinx both hated with a passion. Actually that had been their first conversation that hadn't turned into an argument . . . and the only time they'd actually been out together that he hadn't freaked when someone saw them. But hopefully if he was serious then maybe that would change now-if she ever worked up the nerve to speak to him again after he'd stormed out over Char. Ripley shook herself, turning to the other with a sad smile; knowing that Otto would proudly display the joke-regardless of what the others thought. The sign was simply old and battered, rusted and damaged but it was perfect. She'd seen them scattered everywhere around Long Beach in her youth, the bright red letters against fading beige a vibrant warning to the citizens of their home. Lock your car up or it'll be gone in 60 seconds. She grinned, turning to find the proprietor; making sure that the other few people crowded around didn't try to steal her finds first. A hand on her shoulder made her turn, laughter bubbling forth before she could stop it at what Raines was barely able to hold up for her approval. The pedal car was large and cumbersome, made to look like a combination of an old Rolls Royce and a Model T. But what got her was the pretty pastel pink paint and silver details; the hood ornament a tiny silver crown that looked so much like the ones that had been on Penn's walls. Memphis grinned, shifting the car as he almost dropped it; forcing her to help him catch the awkward toy. The car itself seemed sturdy enough, the body actually made of metal and rubber instead of plastic while real thin tires sat on surprisingly sturdy spokes and axles. He shifted, his cheeks tinting pink as he nodded towards the toy; the joy and worry in his eyes making Ripley bite her lip all over again. He was so excited and proud to have found this . . . and apparently terrified that she didn't think Penn would like it. But it already the three things the kid needed to loved it-namely it was pink, it had a crown and was so damned cute it was almost sickening. \"Do-do you think she would like it? I haven't really gotten her any toys yet . . . and she could ride this around the yard and at the shop if she's there. And look!\" Memphis tapped the side, the metal tinging slightly as he started babbling; going on and on about all of the things they could do to the toy to make it better if his daughter didn't take to it immediately. \"Its metal so we can even sand it down and paint it if she doesn't like the color. Hell we'll probably end up doing it anyway with the way everyone in my family seems to wreck at least once a week. And when she gets bigger we could probably rig something to turn it into a little go cart or-\" Ripley laughed, reaching out and laying her hand over his mouth; shaking her head as she damn near cackled. Oh he was too fucking cute to keep doing this. She wouldn't be able to stop herself from laughing every single time he looked at the car if he didn't stop talking! But she still found herself nodding, agreeing as helped him get a better grip on the car to take it to the register. \"It's perfect Raines. But do us a favor? Shut up or I'm not going to be held responsible for what happens at the next meet. Got it?\" Memphis stilled before he rolled his eyes, shaking her off as they made their way towards the cashier; grumbling even though the smile never left his lips. \"Whatever, Guadimus. You're just pissed you didn't find it first. She's going to love this! Hell maybe she'll actually like me more than you if I give her this.\" Ripley rolled her eyes, shaking her head with a sigh; motioning back to the other two signs as the proprietor stepped up to take the kiddie car from them. \"Hi, this and the other two signs above those parts please.\" Memphis raised a brow, looking to the Chevelle sign before he rolled his eyes again. Only to perk and grin at the theft sign, letting loose a sarcastic bark of laughter as the younger clerk handed Ripley the first wrapped sign. \"Oh shit, Ripley. I didn't think they still made these things! I remember they used to be everywhere but now you barely see them. Why get the Malibu sign though? You're a diehard SS disciple all the way.\" Ripley winked, moving to dig her wallet out of the massive bag she'd brought with her; her hair curling wildly around her shoulders and face. Memphis stilled, momentarily shocked by how happy she looked; how much younger and just content she seemed buying the signs and being away from the rest of the shit their crew seemed to stay in. But as she spoke, her mood changed; falling and darkening to the point that she looked more like he was used to. \"I know. Otto's going to flip his shit when he sees it . . . and the other sign is for Atley. He's always trying to figure out what to give the brooding bastard he calls a friend and if I find something I think might work I always pick it up for him. Atley hates all of this shopping shit anyway so it works out pretty well.\" Memphis blinked, stunned at the piece of information. Atley had always groaned to the other members of the Old School about Sphinx's birthdays and Christmas, never completely sure what to give the quiet mean boost. Until he would pop up one day and start crowing about how he'd come across the perfect thing. Just last year he'd managed to coerce a rare true smile out of the stoic bastard when he'd presented him with a brand new wool pea coat, the black thick jacket quickly replacing the one he'd always worn during the colder months of the year. \"You do that every year? Even last Christmas?\" Ripley nodded, pushing a crisp $50 into the shopkeeper's hand before Memphis could get to his wallet; accepting her change and the handwritten receipt before she shifted her signs beneath her arm. Memphis gave her a warning look but she waved it off, helping him resituate the toy car until he could carry it a little easier. She caught the sleeve of his coat, tugging him back towards the furniture he'd been distracted from; continuing their conversation as she looked over the booths the past. \"Yeah. I stepped out to smoke a bowl with Mirror one night when Sphinx had just pulled up. And we all know Mirror can't waste an opportunity to aggravate Sphinx. So when he went to push by us I wasn't too terribly shocked that Mirror started talking, practically blocked his way into the garage while he started pulling on his jacket and asking if Sphinx ever took it off. I could see it was getting old so I dropped Atley the hint.\" Memphis nodded as he smirked, turning to follow Ripley as she started towards a set of black furniture further away from the others. \"Don't I though. I swear I have no idea why he likes to push Sphinx's buttons but ever since they met Mirror's made it his mission to keep Sphinx on his toes.\" Ripley chuckled, giving him a soft smile before she motioned for him to sit the car on the mattress; running her hands over the pillow topped bed before she turned to inspect the dresser and mirror. The black furniture looked more like it belonged in a teenager's room but the headboard had all of these flowers and plants carved into it; the cut aways letting light shine through. The dresser drawers had the same carvings etched into the dark wood, though they were missing a few pulls and the mirror itself was cracked down at the bottom. She looked over the dresser critically, pulling hard to open a drawer before she nodded. Memphis turned, looking at the price tag Ripley pulled off of the top of the headboard; blinking at the number before he shook his head. That couldn't be right. They had to want more than $250 for the set. Hell even with the damaged dresser and mirror the bed was worth more than that. Ripley looked up, her eyes scanning the other pieces near them before she shrugged; handing him the tag as she moved to walk away. \"Tag says the price is for all of this-mattress and box springs included. I know a full is a little big for Penn right now but look at it this way-Hex can make her some toddler rails if she can't get used to it. And this will last her for a while.\" He raised a brow, feeling his cheeks grow warm as she rolled her eyes; pointing back towards the set. \"Everything is solid oak, Raines. The inside of the drawers are lined with cedar so they'll keep. We can pick out new pulls and fix the tracks easy enough if some of the other drawers are hard to open. Is $250 okay? I don't think we're going to find a better deal than this one. If you need the help I brought enough with me to cover it. We can always settle up later-it's what Atley and I always do.\" Suddenly Memphis wondered just how well Sphinx would handle hearing that Ripley helped their friend pick his presents. Would it endear her to the stoic man or would he be insulted? Memphis shook himself; shifting on his feet as he pulled out his wallet and fingered through the cash he'd brought. Junie and Otto had sworn that they wouldn't find anything of quality for less than a solid grand, Otto pushing $500 into his hands as he and Ripley had set out from the garage before he could argue. He sighed, pulling out three bills and handing them to her; giving her a pointed look. \"Here. This should more than cover it. And you're going to keep the change to make up for that stunt with the car, Kid.\" Ripley gave him a look that all but screamed that she would do exactly the opposite, rolling her eyes as she moved to find the person in charge of selling furniture as she waved him off. \"Sure, sure Raines. I'm going to find whoever and pay-we can argue about money later. But first we need to get this on the back of Hex's truck-before we find anything else to fill it up.\" Memphis snorted; shaking his head, idly wondering just how many of Sphinx's presents from Atley had actually been hers. And why neither of the crazy idiots had ever said anything. He crossed his arms, leaning against his daughter's new dresser with a loud huff as he closed his eyes. Probably because Atley knew better than to argue with the insane woman. yeah . . .[Chapter 16] And we extend Penn's vocabulary in Three, two, one . . . Furnished Atley grunted, lifting as much as he could while Hex pulled; Sphinx pushing against the other side of the dresser as they fought to get it over the threshold. When Memphis had called, excited and gloating over finding Penn's perfect furniture for less than $300 they'd all breathed a sigh of relief. One more thing done for the toddler was one less thing they had to worry about. And considering Ripley had been the one to pick the set-and the hardware to replace the existing pulls-no one had second guessed the decision. Until Raines had pulled up in Hex's truck, the bed loaded down with furniture and bags; with a leaning tower of small things for the house piled precariously on the bench seat beside Ripley. At first he'd thought that maybe Raines had finally snapped under the pressure, that he'd lost his sanity and Ripley had been drug along for the ride. But the second she'd stepped out of the car, handing bag after bag to Kip and Tumbler he knew she'd gone as crazy as Raines had. That was the only logical explanation he could find as to why his longtime friends had done this to them. Because who in their right mind picked 200 lbs of solid oak furniture for a two year old?! Sphinx growled, pushing hard as Hex groaned; nearly toppling back as the dresser finally slid over the ancient door step of the Raines household. Atley sighed sagging against his side of the dresser for a minute as Hex stepped back to roll his shoulder. Sphinx glared at both of them, scrambling to compensate for the loss of leverage as the dresser started to slide back out of the house. Atley jumped, he and Hex reaching out and catching their side of the monstrous piece of furniture; both blinking as Sphinx started to curse and rant. It was odd to see the normally stoic boost start to crack but the man had been odder than usual since their lunch with Priest and the others. He'd rarely spoken and seemed sullen, either glaring and grunting at any attempt to talk or staring off into space before he and Ripley had argued over Char's sudden reappearance. Plus they'd been fighting this damn thing for almost half an hour. Everyone was getting irritated with the fucking dresser. \" Really?! You two bloody bastards decide to take a break now?! You're worse than the fucking kids!\" Atley glared at Sphinx over the top of the dresser as Hex started pulling it back into the house; none of them aware of their tiny audience until a small high voice right beside his ear made all three of them jump. \"Uncle Atley what's a bastard?\" Sphinx got it the worst, having to drop to his knees hard to catch the dresser as Atley jerked towards Penn; Hex squawking as he jumped back and away from the unexpected noise. Leaving the now glowering grumbling Sphinx partially trapped beneath the heavy dresser; promising a violent bloody death for both of them if they didn't help him get the dresser inside before it crushed his knees. \"I swear to God and all that's holy- you two sodding wankers pick this bleeding thing up or I'm going to gut the lot of you!\" Atley ran a hand down his face, moving to help again as Hex rolled his eyes; rubbing a hand over his chest as he dipped and took in a deep breath. Penn just looked between them, tiny brow raised as she watched them. Hex looked to him, Atley shrugging before they both grabbed the dresser. Only to drop it again as Penn voiced her previous question. Oh Junie and Memphis were going to skin them alive for this shit! \"Uncle Atley you didn't answer. What's a bastard? And how come Mr. Sphinx's so mad?\" Atley closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath as he prepared to lie his ass off; only to nearly crow in victory as Ripley rounded the hallway corner into the living room. Penn's eyes locked on the older girl, her previous curiosity forgotten as she grinned and dove. Ripley rolled her eyes but caught her, swinging her up to settle on her left hip as she crossed the living room. Nodding indulgently as the tiny girl started to chatter. \"Auntie Ripley! You're back! Did you and Daddy Memphis have fun at the bug markets?\" Ripley stopped just beside them, closing her eyes as she let her head fall back slightly; exhaling slowly as she her lips trembled. Atley ducked his head to hide his grin, Hex snickering beside him as they picked their end back up. It was getting harder and harder to ignore that-for all of the new people Penn had met in the past few days-Ripley and the Halliwells were among her favorites. Sure the toddler wasn't exactly afraid of the rest of them but she sought Ripley out every chance she could, looking for Otto and Junie if her first choice wasn't in sight. And Ripley was hardly ever out of her sight if Penn could help it. Small hands touched Ripley's cheeks, making her look to the toddler in her arms as Penn's little hands moved over her face inquisitively. Atley stilled, watching amazed as Guadimus let the girl touch her; sticky little fingers moving from her cheeks to her lips before trailing back up to her eyes to pet her long lashes. Ripley blinked, shifting Penn to reach up and wipe at her face; earning a happy peal of laughter from the little girl as she locked her arms around her neck. \"Auntie Ripley! You made a funny face!\" Ripley rolled her eyes, giving Penn a warning look before she sighed; shifting her to rest on her opposite hip as she moved closer to the door. The lavender blonde boost raised a brow at the stalled movers before she shrugged, hugging Penn just a little tighter as the girl leaned out to wave to Sphinx. Who just sighed loudly and rolled his eyes skyward, his lips moving as he grumbled and groused. But most of the hostility seemed to wane away, his words having hardly any bite at all as he nodded to Ripley. \"Oh fer the love o'- Move ! This thing's not exactly light here.\" Ripley stopped; raising a brow at Sphinx for a moment before she turned to look towards the kitchen, her voice raising enough to carry without ever sounding aggravated or hassled. Even though Atley knew from the slight tick to her left eye that she was definitely both. Then again Penn had adopted the habit of using her as a personal jungle gym and she was in a crowded house during the summer. A time she reserved for her strictly legal obligations to give herself at least a tiny bit of a break. \"I am aware of that Sphinx-I did pick it out. Which is why Kip and Tumbler were supposed to help you move the furniture. GUYS? What are you doing?\" A loud thud sounded from down the hall, followed by what sounded like a small herd of elephants tearing down the hallways before Tumbler and Kip pushed into the den; Freb and Mirror on their heels. Ripley's eyes narrowed as three of the four ducked their heads, Mirror the only one who met her glare head on. \"You rang, Sexy ?\" Ripley rolled her eyes before Penn spoke, bringing her eyes snapping to Mirror as the shorter boost flinched; folding in on himself while the others choked back groans and giggles. \"Auntie Ripley, what's sexy mean?\" Ripley closed her eyes for a long moment before she turned her back on the Youngbloods, reaching up to push Penn's hair out of her face as she spoke. Atley choked back a snicker of his own, Hex's shoulders shaking as he laid his head on the dresser; the piece of furniture jittering slightly as he fought laughing. Even Sphinx looked dangerously close to losing it, his lips tugged to the side even as he tried to keep glaring at the slackers behind Ripley. \"Nothing, honey. Mirror's just being silly. You don't repeat it and everything will be fine, okay?\" Penn nodded sagely, turning to look at Mirror before she sighed and shook her head; crossing her tiny arms and leaning against Ripley a little heavier. \"Boys are weird .\" Ripley nodded, glancing over Penn to glare at Mirror; who had the intelligence to look afraid. But all of that changed as Penn looked up again, eyes wide and excited as she reached up and tugged on Ripley's fishtail braid; causing the braid to come lose and ringlets to start falling around her face. \" Oooh! Aunt Ripley, I gots 'nother question!\" Ripley sighed, reaching up and shaking her hair free; motioning to the idiots to move and help. She turned back to Penn, no one pointing out the toddler had a handful of curls; twisting the lavender blonder curls over her fingers as she waited for her finish. \" WELL?! What are you waiting for, a formal invitation? Get over there and help them! That freaking thing is a lot heavier than it looks! *SIGH* what was your question, Pennelope?\" Penn straightened, head held high and little shoulders squared as she opened her mouth. \"Aunt Ripley, what's a bastard?\" Several things happened simultaneously. Kip and Tumbler both squawked, turning to Penn as Mirror leapt back and screamed that he didn't teach her that word. Hex finally lost the battle against his snickers, dropping the dresser completely as he grabbed his stomach; laughing long and hard as he fell back onto his ass on the hardwoods. Atley jerked at the scream Ripley let loose, moving to keep her from killing the kids as they all backed away from her; Penn still tugging on her curls insistently as she asked her question again. Which left just Sphinx holding the dresser, trying to keep it from sliding back down the steps before he lost his grip; the solid black oak falling on his foot. He growled, cursing aloud as Ripley's head jerked to him; Atley moving to cover Penn's ears as she handed the toddler off. \" SON OF A BITCH! Don't drop the damned thing!\" She moved, grabbing Hex from the floor before they picked up the closest end of the dresser; the Irishman laughing so hard he was crying even as Ripley glared at him. Kip snapped out of his daze, moving to help them as Tumbler slid across the top of the dresser; landing beside Sphinx before he started trying to lift the heavy chest off the still cursing boost's feet. After a few hectic moments they succeeded, pulling the black dresser inside and to the side before Ripley moved to check on Sphinx; grumbling under her breath as Penn jumped from Atley's arms to latch onto Hex's shoulders. The toddler still pestering the adults around her for the answer to her question. \"Uncle Hex! Aunt Ripley won't tell me what a bastard is!\" That's all for now kiddies![Chapter 17] Okay this is going to be a smaller update while I wait for my next round of tests. Gotta keep the boredom at bay right? I apologize before hand for any grammatical errors you might find; it's been an odd last few days. No major warnings-other than language and some fluffy bits. And yes, I know they're fluffy bits. No on kill me just yet. Hope you enjoy! Proper Sphinx shifted awkwardly in his spot on his couch, wincing as Ripley worked her fingers over his now throbbing foot. When the idiots had let the dresser fall he'd known-from both the pain and the pop that at least one of his toes had been damn close to dislocated. But the second Tumbler had used the top like a bloody slide he'd lost all hope of escaping unscathed. Especially since they'd dropped it again before the group of them had been able to maneuver the blasted thing to its proper place indoors. He shifted again, trying his best to appear comfortable as the lavender blonde smoothed her fingertips over the swollen tender flesh of his third left toe; pointedly ignoring the fact that he'd finally found his opportunity. Ripley had been quick to run or hide since their discussions the week prior; never letting the two of them be alone together for more than a few seconds before she'd find some reason to leave. When the crew had gone to disperse from the Raines household Sphinx had seized his shot; pointedly telling the girl that he needed her to check his foot even when he'd known he could reset whatever damage himself. Ripley had raised a brow at him but shrugged, agreeing to take him home even after Atley had overheard and offered to take him to the docs. But now that he had her alone-in his own home for the first time oddly enough-he couldn't do anything but fight his nerves. Before he'd had a complete list of things to talk with her about; things they needed to discuss to clear the air between them. Like how he hadn't known that she'd taken his picking and pestering to heart; how he hadn't been serious whenever they would fight or bicker-merely keeping up appearances to give them some semblance of privacy (and because he enjoyed having someone who wasn't afraid to pester him back). He'd planned to tell her that while it wasn't something he normally did he'd decided that they needed to at least try to be together in some shape or form. That if things didn't work it wouldn't be because they didn't give it a fighting chance. But now as she knelt in front of his couch, working the topical analgesic into his skin he couldn't for the life of him figure out how to start the conversation they so desperately needed to have. He scowled cringing as she pushed the dislodged phalange back into its socket; the wet pop as sickening to hear as it was relieving to feel. He wiggled his toes experimentally; his shoulders relaxing as the joint creaked and popped, the pain ebbing away bit by bit. Well at least he didn't have to go to the hospital now. Ripley watched him wiggle his toes before she sighed, giving him a deadpan look as she reached out and caught his foot again; stilling his movement while she slowly wrapped the appendage with the Ace bandage she'd insisted on stopping and purchasing. She'd looked at him like he was insane when he'd suggested that she use one of his older ones, her eyes widening comically and her mouth falling open before she'd shook her head and firmly told him no. She hadn't cared that he'd been the only person to use the wraps-or that he'd cleaned them properly; going on and on about how he was just inviting some nasty infection or bacteria to fester in his skin like she had firsthand knowledge. She shifted on her knees, sitting up a little straighter as she tugged the fabric taut; the careful measured movements letting him know that she had done this before. But with the way she and her brother went at everything they faced it wasn't too surprising to think that she'd doctored her fair share of wounds. Or inflicted them for that matter. \"You'll need to ice this and stay off the foot for the rest of the night. It's going to be bruised and sore but if it doesn't start to feel better then you're going to need to have it looked at.\" He shook himself, gray green locking with aqua as she cut her eyes to him; her bottom lip firmly between her teeth as she finished the last pass around his ankle. She kept his gaze for a few moments until he dipped his chin to her, her cheeks flushing prettily as she ducked her head and sighed. Finally she pushed up and into a crouch, balancing on the balls of her feet as she ran her hands down her face; yawning loudly before she shook herself. He could tell that she'd slept about as much as he had, from both her subdued attitude and the dark circles shining beneath the seldom worn makeup. But even though she seemed as exhausted and tired as he was something had changed since they'd spoken last. It was like the world wasn't weighing on her as heavily as it had been, like she could actually breathe for the first time in years now that her brother's release was imminent rather than just hopeful. She turned moving to grab her bag when she lost her balance, catching herself on his thighs before she stopped to think; her cheeks darkening as she moved to pull away and stand. Sphinx moved first, catching her left wrist as he tugged her to him; his free hand moving to brush her bangs away from her eyes before he cupped her cheek. If he didn't act now, do something to prove he'd been serious before then he doubted he would get a second chance. Just like he knew-despite what he wanted to do that if he pushed her she would bolt. Meaning he had to do this just right-without bolloxing it the way he had before. He swallowed the lump in his suddenly dry throat, forcing the words past his lips like his life depended on them. \" Stay . Please?\" Ripley blinked owlishly at him before she closed her eyes, her lips tugging down into a frown. Sphinx leaned in as he tugged her closer, ghosting his lips over hers as he let her wrist go. Both of his hands went to her face, cupping her cheeks as he cradled her against him. Ripley's eyes fluttered open, searching his before she leaned into his touch; her moist eyes closing again as her tongue darted over her lips. He knew it was a simple touch, something that wouldn't normally mean much to anyone else but to him-to them it was groundbreaking. Neither of them were overly fond of being handled and pawed at, both of them skittish of touch for their own reasons. And while he had his doubts if Ripley's were as deeply ingrained as his she was just as damned paranoid; never trusting fast movements and always looking for the next blow to come. Finally she let out a shuddering breath, her tongue flicking across his thumb as she wet her lips again; her eyes downcast even as she leaned into his touch just the tiniest bit more. \"I-I don't know, Sphinx. I don't think that's for the best-\" He eased his lips against hers, swallowing her protests as her hands moved to fist in the material of his shirt; her throaty little moan rebutting her last statement. Sphinx took his time, his lips moving over hers in lazy contented kisses; neither rushing to part even as their lungs started to burn. Eventually he pulled back just enough to speak; his lips still hovering over hers. \"It wasn't what you thought- before . Priest kept goin' on and on 'bout being new here. 'Bout wanting to get out and meet people every time we've had to share a space. And I figured Atley'd be as good a test as any. He'd either break her o' all her snobbery or he'd vindicate her . . . But I was serious before- not because I'm bored or there's nothing better about. I want you -not her. Same as I always do.\" Ripley looked to him from beneath her lashes, big watery eyes so open and vulnerable Sphinx felt his chest tighten almost painfully as he realized something crucial. This had been what had been missing, why he'd never attempted more than what they'd had despite his own random passing thoughts. Ripley was as guarded as he was-more so in her own quirky little ways- but to see that she was willing to drop even a few of her walls made him hopeful. The idea of forming more with her had steadily gained appeal since he'd started honestly considering it; and to be perfectly honest he was tired of being alone when he wasn't with her or the others. They had a chance here for something more; something real from the way she was looking at him and the way his heart was practically beating out of his chest. And he wasn't about to let it slip away because he had doubts on whether or not it would be lasting or fleeting. \"I don't *SIGH* I don't want to go back to the way things were. I-if we do this then no secrets. No more sneaking or lying to the others-and no one else. If you don't want that; can't do that then-\" Sphinx kissed her again, a quick and reassuring press of lips before he nodded; resting his forehead against hers. \"I'm game for that, Love but are you? This is gonna be a two way street.\" Ripley leaned back, lips pursed and brow raised. \"What do you mean? You're the one who didn't want the others to know. I mean I wasn't too keen on having everybody involved in my personal life but I'm not ashamed of the fact that I'm sleeping with you-\" Sphinx's face darkened as he huffed, rolling his eyes as he moved to rest his cheek against hers with a sigh. \"I didn't want them involved because of how bloody nosy they all are. And you know the second we tell 'em anything they'll all have their own opinions about how horrible of an idea all o' this is. Specially with how we usually carry on with another-not that it matters now. What I mean is you're gonna hafta to talk to me when something's under your skin. Not just bottle it up until you finally snap.\" Ripley blushed darkly, glancing away with a shrug even as she leaned into him; letting him savor just being able to touch and be touched. But her words made him scowl; his elation short lived as he felt her start to stiffen. \"Yeah well I'm not going to apologize for freaking out on you-because honestly you didn't seem interested in anything outside of our physical association. I mean, one minute you acted like you wanted me then you didn't spare me a glance. What was I supposed to think? It's not like you actually came to me and asked to sit down and discuss all of this.\" Sphinx sighed, turning her to face him as he dipped; their noses touching as he locked eyes with her. She looked about ready to start crying again-something he desperately wanted to keep from happening. Seeing her break before had been bad enough but if she started now he knew he wouldn't be able to take it. If there was one thing in the world he'd ever learned from his time with his uncle in London it was that it never did well to make a woman cry. Especially one that was likely to start shooting or burning things once the tears and hurt subsided to the anger that was usually quick to follow. \"Hey now, none o' that. I *SIGH* I'm not going to make you any grand promises, Girlie. I'm not gentle or kind-I know I'm an ass and a selfish one at that. But I swear that so long as you're willing to try I'll do as right by you as I can. I'm never going to carry on long conversations; I'm not much for all of the drama and rules the others seem to thrive in but I promise to listen. To have your back-even if you think I won't.\" Ripley looked at him for a few long heartbeats, her eyes unreadable before her lips tugged to the side and she smiled. Honest to God smiled at him like he was the most amazing thing she'd ever seen as her hands slid up his chest to settle on either side of his neck. She shifted closer, the smile never truly leaving her lips even as she spoke. \"Can-can we just talk tonight? Clear the air? I admit that I've always wondered about a few things . . . and our lives might be easier if you knew more than whatever Atley's let slip when he's had a few too many.\" Sphinx smirked even as he rolled his eyes skyward, grumbling good naturedly as she smacked his shoulder. \"Oh fer the love of God. Just like a bloody woman. I agree to all of your wants and demands and the first thing you want to do is talk .\" \"Yeah well most men say more than ten words a year so imagine all of the concessions I'm making here.\" He snorted, dodging her next smack with a dark grin. \"I say more than ten words a year, Girlie.\" \"Ten nice things?\" Sphinx stilled, giving her a deadpan look as she leaned back and crossed her arms; obviously undeterred by his expression. It was nice to see she still wasn't going to cower from him or consent to something just to keep them from arguing. In all honesty her mouth and attitude had been what had drawn him in to begin with; pushing him to pick and pester her just to see how far her courage and temper extended. Over time what had been mild amusement and moderate annoyance grew to a begrudging respect; only to blossom into the affection he held for her now. He knew they were too different to ever coexist peacefully but as long as she didn't start to change or whither he could live with that knowledge. If anything it would make life more interesting. \"Did we not just cover that I'm not nice?\" Ripley kept her serious expression for a few moments longer than he'd expected her to but finally her grin broke through; her eyes shining as she relaxed just the slightest bit more. She settled into his hold; not seeming to mind when his hands slid down her body to rest solidly on her hips. \"Oh trust me, I know. But so long as you're nicer to me then you'll survive the rest of the year.\" He leaned in, his lips brushing against the shell of her ear as he braced himself for his next question. He knew they'd pretty much covered everything but something in him wouldn't let him go on blind faith and the tentative agreement they'd just made. He wanted to ask her, to give her the opportunity to answer him plainly so they both knew where they stood. And the unspoken consequences of breaking away from what they were attempting. \"You want to see each other, then? Proper like?\" She blushed so brightly her cheeks were almost purple but she nodded; pressing her lips against the corner of his jaw as she answered him. He felt the rest of the tension he'd carried the past week-past months start to ebb and fade; her words easing his anxiety rather than increasing it the way entering committed relationships usually did. God why had it taken this long to stumble upon this? \"Proper.\" Yep. I'm officially insane now. On to the next one![Chapter 18] Okay I've had a lot of questions about Sway and Memphis-and all I'm willing to say at this point is we'll have to wait and see. That however doesn't mean I'm so evil that I won't give the eldest Raines a little love. Brooklynn Memphis hunched beneath the open hood of the cherry red 350GT 64 Mustang, grinding his teeth as he angled the work light to inspect the motor. Not that there was much left at this point-the damn thing was almost shot! The heads were warped, the radiator had a hole the size of his fist-though at this point it was impossible to tell if it was from the piston blowout, serious overheating or something else -and she'd thrown not one but two rods! And that wasn't even counting he crack in the engine, the obvious warping to the axles he'd spotted before or the burnt oil smell still lingering beneath the hood. He shifted, glaring at the almost worthless hunk of metal; trying to find any piece of the motor that didn't need to be completely rebuilt. Whoever drove this poor car had no clue how to treat her . . . and now Otto wanted him to completely overhaul it. Christ it would be less expensive to buy a new engine outright! He snorted, wiping his brow as sweat started to trickle down and into his eyes; knowing as soon as he spotted the new clean spot on his sleeve that he'd left a black greasy streak over his left eye. Great. Now he had to go home and shower before he could go run his errands-including going back to the grocery store to grab Penn's coveted grape juice. Because his daughter was convinced she would die if she drank the apple juice Tumbler had grabbed by mistake. Memphis sagged against the front of the car, letting his eyes close as he tried to figure out the first course of action for this poor engine . . . Only to groan when a bubbly bright voice called out to him. \"Excuse me? Sir?\" He pushed away from the car, opening his mouth to snap when he stopped; momentarily floored by what-or rather who was waiting on him. The woman was absolutely gorgeous with dark blonde hair; fringe bangs falling to just above her brows while the rest hung around her face and shoulders in this straight sleek curtain of spun gold and caramel. Her eyes were big and expressive, bright cyan framed with dark lashes above a sculpted nose and perfect pouty lips; all coming together in a soft heart shaped face. The woman looked at him for a moment before she shifted, letting him notice the painted on black pants; the light blue blouse hugging her figure while her grey heeled boots brought her eyes to his chin. She glanced towards the main portion of the garage before she stopped; her expression becoming coy as she brushed her hair out of her face. After a few moments she smiled, eyes dancing as she stepped forward; pointing to the car he'd been working on. \"Can it be saved? The car I mean.\" Memphis blinked before he nodded dumbly, tugging the rag from his back pocket as he realized he still had grease all over his face. He wanted to tell her no-that she'd managed to fuck her poor engine beyond repair but he didn't. Instead he found himself falling into the same pattern of thought Otto had tried to impart before. The car could be fixed-with a shitload of work and time he really didn't have the wiggle room to pull . . . But as she smiled at him again he knew he was going to agree even if it wasn't in his best interests. \"Yeah-with a lot of work.\" He stopped, glancing towards the steps to the office before he sighed; deciding to get the worst part over. Once she heard the price discussion she'd probably bail; demanding a second opinion or say total the thing altogether. \"It isn't going to be cheap, though. The whole engine needs to be rebuilt and with these problems I'm pretty sure you need a new transmission.\" The woman blinked at him owlishly before she shrugged, giving him a sultry smirk coupled with a flirty wink. \"Cost is no object-so long as its in good hands.\" Memphis nodded dazedly, answering on autopilot as he soaked up her smile. God how long had it been since someone smiled at him like that? \"The best, Ma'am.\" Her grin turned wicked as her eyes raked over him; the new gleam to them causing a shiver to course down his spine. \"I'm sure they are. Hopefully I'll find out first hand.\" Memphis felt his jaw try to drop before he shook himself, taking her hand as she extended it. \"I'm Brooklynn. Brooklynn McCallen.\" He gave her a grin, nodding as he kept her hand in his. Her skin was clean, almost pristine in comparison to the oil dirt and grease covering his own; her palm and fingertips smooth while his were calloused and scraped. But she didn't offer to draw back, squeezing his hand again as her cheeks flushed. \"Randal. Randal Raines.\" Brooklynn and Memphis both turned as San pushed into the room, the slightly bulky boost looking between them before he shook himself; giving the woman one of his friendlier smiles. But Memphis could tell-from the tightness around his eyes and at the corner of his lips that something was eating at San. He watched him for a few moments until he spoke, chalking it up to his normal gruffness before he turned back to the woman whose hand he still had in his own. \"Ms. McCallen? You ready to finish up that paperwork?\" Brooklynn grinned, slowly sliding her hand from his as she turned back to go towards the office; her hips sashaying as she went. And Memphis knew, when she glanced back at him to wave before she rounded the corner that he was in trouble. This girl-no woman would eat him alive if she ever got the chance . . . So why didn't he care? And-more to the point-why was he tempted to look over her chart for her number? Ripley rounded the corner moving into to Otto's, cheeks flushed as she tried to keep herself from grinning. It had been an odd week since she and Sphinx had agreed to be in what he considered a 'proper' relationship-and she was steadily realizing the difference between what they'd had and what they were making was pretty staggering. Honestly at first she hadn't really expected much of a difference-save the fact that they would eventually have to tell the others that they'd been sneaking around for over the past year and a half. So when she'd started waking up to text messages and getting random calls throughout the day she'd almost stroked; fighting back the fear that maybe she'd jumped into something she wasn't really ready for. Sure she wanted more with Sphinx but she hadn't really considered what more would mean, focusing too intently on how she'd just wanted to stop with all of the bullshit between them. Did they still bicker and pick at one another? Sure. But had he been as hateful as he had been before-not even close. Actually he'd apologized a few times, telling her that he'd honestly thought she understood he wasn't being spiteful or hateful; that he'd just popped off at her the way he normally did Atley. But now-nearly a week later she was finding she didn't mind the almost constant communication . . . and that she almost missed the way they fought and squabbled. God how pathetic did that sound? Her boyfriend was trying to be a proper boyfriend and she almost wanted him to argue and snark the way he had before. She sighed, pushing her hair back out of her face as she made her way towards the steps. She really didn't have the extra time to devote to Otto's files the way she once had but she wasn't about to leave him in the lurch. At least not until she and Junie wore him down enough to actually hire someone to take over when neither of them could. She knew why he fought the change; why none of the others pushed even when the jumbled offices and wrecked files made their lives a living hell. Sway had been Otto's last office minion . . . and she knew that neither he or Memphis had the heart to put anyone else in the battered green monster of a chair. Even with her gone three years and probably dead. Ripley shook herself, refusing to let the melancholy set in as she started upstairs; reaching back to tie her hair in a knot as she took the steps two and three at a time. She needed to hurry before she was late to her five o'clock appointment . . . or before Frank and San spotted her and tried to coerce her to go for drinks after work. She grinned, rolling her eyes to herself as she hopped onto the landing; pushing into the legal office without much thought. Only to grimace at what was waiting for her. San was standing towards the back of the office, a thick file in hand and jaw clenched so hard her face hurt just looking at him; teeth grit as he glared at the bosomy blonde pacing in front of the seldom used desk. Ripley blinked, nodding to San as she eased into the room. Keeping to herself as she moved around the back of the desk; sinking into the chair as she flicked the shop laptop on. Toby was a true fucking babydoll for replacing the dinosaur Otto had used before with the newer, sturdy laptop; giving whoever got stuck with the office work the choice of carrying the files with them into the shop. So they could yell at the (ir)responsible parties accordingly when the occasion called for it. She cut her eyes over to San as he spoke again, his voice loosing its calm undertone as his anger and aggravation started to become even more apparent. \"While I am aware you have more than enough to cover the cost of repairs, Ms. McCallen I'm concerned with how the car got to be in such bad shape. Which is why we have these discussions with the owners, to talk about the performance of the vehicle and see if there are any other problems that you're aware of.\" Blondie rolled her eyes as she stopped in front of the cork message board by the door, reaching up and running her fingers over the glossy picture of Memphis and Kip with Otto before she glanced back at him. But even though her words sounded sweet they still carried this sharp edge; her eyes narrowing despite her saccharine tone. \"So basically you want me to do your job for you. To tell you everything I know about my car so you don't have to do anything.\" San growled, his hands clenching into thick fists as he glared at her. Suddenly all pretenses of polite and cordial were gone, replaced by the crass smartass she was more familiar with. She raised a brow, momentarily stunned at the sheer venom lacing his last few words. Christ she'd only ever heard him bitch at his ex like this. What in the hell had Blondie done? \"This IS our job. Its called a diagnostic interview-performance and restoration shops all down the West Coast conduct them every single day, at least ten times a day. We do this for all of our customers-and no one else has complained. As a matter of fact they appreciate it.\" He stopped, collecting himself before he continued; some of the bite leaving his tone even though the heat stayed behind his glare. \"To be perfectly honest your car is shot. You've thrown two pistons, your radiator is shot and the engine itself is only a turn away from locking down for good. This is a lot of time, painstaking attention to detail and man hours we're about to sink into this project. We need to know if there are other problems we need to be aware of. Can you think of any or do I need to call Nigel?\" The woman blinked at him as she crossed her arms, the epitome of puzzled before she shook her head. Like that simple action was going to clear her head enough for her to gather her thoughts. Ripley turned back to the laptop, trying not to roll her eyes as she started reviewing the most current progress reports. She doubted anything would clear that woman's head enough for her to think-especially with what she told San next. \"Who in the hell is Nigel?\" San growled, searching through the file before he pulled a blue carbon free; the logo for Nigel Highpost's shop in Seal Beach as clear as it could be. He waved the paper, finally loosing all professionalism as he started ranting. \"Nigel Highpost. He owns Stock and Seal Customs down in Seal Beach? The garage that referred you to us?\" Blondie blinked before she shrugged, moving to sink into the chair across from San with a huff and a wave. Like she was dismissing the fact that she didn't know her own mechanic's name like it was expected. \"Oh. Well you have the paper why don't you call and ask him? He's the only person my father normally lets work on our family's vehicles. Though I don't know why-he told me he couldn't fix my car. That the only people he knew who could were here and then they might not be able to.\" San nodded, his right eye twitching before he sighed; trying desperately to regain his composure. \"Yes, ma'am. I'm aware of that. I was there when Otto took the call. But Nigel can't tell us how the car drives from day to day. Only the person that drives it can. So how has your car driven for the past month?\" She stopped, rolling her eyes before she huffed; flopping back into the seat like a spoiled child. \"Oh for God's sakes! Its driven fine-until it started to stall and chug. Then it wouldn't crank, refusing to stay running unless I press the gas all the way to floor. And this little light keeps coming on-something about servicing and oil- And then there was this horrible thumping noise-Oh why are you asking me? I just drive the car. You're the mechanics. Fix it.\" San pushed to his feet suddenly, hands up as he motioned towards the door; Ripley burying her face in her hands as she fought back her snickers. Oh thank you God she wasn't the one having to deal with this! Because while it was funny to see San so worked up she knew that she'd do worse in his place. A lot worse. \"Alright! That's all we need. Someone will give you a call if we have anymore questions-Have a nice day.\" Blondie looked at him before she snorted, pushing to her feet with her nose held high in the air as she looked down at San. And Ripley felt all of her humor vanish, replaced by wrath as the woman started practically ranting about how she'd been treated. Seriously? Hadn't she just been rude and snotty to the people trying to help her? \"You act like that's even possible after spending half of my day here . I swear I thought you people were professionals! But I've spent more time answering pointless questions than anyone has looking over my car! If everything isn't perfect-\" Ripley pushed to her feet as San's expression turned sinister, the man's cool finally reaching its limits as he started to slowly stand. She stepped over to stand beside San, a grounding hand on his forearm as she addressed the other woman. Who looked down at her like she was a piece of filth she scraped from the bottom of her heels; completely and totally oblivious to the fact that she'd almost been gutted for being such a bitch. \"It will be. But to ensure that we have to ask about the car. I know it might seem pointless but these few seemingly random questions will save all of us time-and money. And make sure that we do everything we can to make sure you're happy with our work. But San's right-we have everything we need now and you've been overly helpful and tolerant.\" God that lie burned just trying to force the words together, much less speak them! \"So thank you so much for your time and cooperation. We'll call you with an update within the week.\" The woman seemed to mellow before she nodded, turning on her heel and stalking out of the office without so much as another word; slamming the door behind her as she went. They listened as her heels clicked on the steps loudly before they echoed off the concrete; fading in with the other noises of the shop as she moved further from the office. When it was safe to breathe San exhaled, patting down his pants in search of his cigarettes; grumbling when he kept coming up empty. \"Fucking spoiled harpy. Drove a fucking mint 64 GT350 Fastback into the damn ground then can't even tell me how she did it! I swear I won't touch that fucking car! Otto and Raines can deal with her-cause if I see her again I'm gonna adjust a life long standard of never hitting a woman, Sin. I swear I will. What was all that bullshit you just spouted off with?\" Ripley shrugged, reaching into her purse and pulling out her pack of cigs; handing them to San with a nod. \"Take mine you big idiot. And that bullshit was keeping you from going to jail for assault. Because I don't want to have to visit anyone else behind bulletproof glass.\" Yeah . . .[Chapter 19] A little dose of Tumbler-just for Elven-Princess Ginny. Thanks to everyone whose read, reviewed and faved. I really appreciate it. This is the last chapter for this update, hopefully some more this weekend. Drive In \"Tommy baby! Don't you love me anymore? We used to have so much fun together!\" Tumbler cringed as he ducked beneath the large window in the living room, shooting Kip an apologetic shrug as the ( very ) drunk woman started banging on the door. Again. Kip glared at him as she started sobbing on the other side of the door, neither of them moving in fear that she might somehow sense their presence. Tumbler turned, giving Memphis the same look as he tried to convince Penn to be quiet; the toddler overly irritated at the woman trying to break down their door. \"Daddy makes her go away! We're gonna miss the movies! \" Memphis cut his eyes to him, glaring hard as Kip sighed; digging through his pockets for his cell as Tumbler folded in on himself just a little tighter. He knew this wasn't exactly a great impression for Penn-especially since they were only heading into her second month with them but what did they expect him to do about it? He'd dumped this basketcase for being batshit crazy months before they'd even known the kid existed! It wasn't like he'd called her up and begged her to come squall outside their door at six o'clock at night! Actually he'd told her to do anything but all seventeen times she'd called him in the last week. So despite what the Raines brothers wanted to think this wasn't his fault. \"You'll get to see your movie, Penn. It just might be a little later. Right now we've got to make Uncle Tommy's . . . friend go home. \" Penn turned to him, hands on her hips as she stamped on her feet; her light eyes trained on his as her voice became serious. And suddenly he knew why he'd never wanted kids. They were terrifying enough when they were misbehaving and being brats. But when they put their minds to something they usually succeeded, to young and naïve to understand that maybe they shouldn't. Or stubborn in Penn's case. \"Uncle Tommy! Make her go home! I wants to see Sleepin' Beauties!\" Tumbler swallowed as he nodded, moving to stand when Kip reached out and caught him; shaking his head. The younger Raines shifted the phone from one ear to the other, turning to Memphis as he whispered. \"Oh no you don't. We'll never get out of here if she sees you! Memphis! Ripley's about to be on her way to the shop to meet us . . . what do you want us to do here?\" Memphis sighed before his eyes took on that look, the same look he'd had when Tumbler had almost knocked Castlebeck over the head and Kip had fallen through their ceiling putting shit in the attic last year. The very same look that he knew meant he wasn't going to like what needed to be done-or what was about to be said. He closed his eyes, saying a silent prayer before he resigned himself to his fate. Please God don't let this end badly for him. Ripley pushed outside onto her porch, trying to juggle her phone and purse as fought to get her door closed. Christ of all the times for the wood to swell and be difficult it had to pick today? When she was already fifteen minutes late and had to go rescue the Raines family from some random skank? Finally she growled, tugging it closed with a huff before she turned. Only to scream as she nearly ran into Sphinx. She clutched her chest, dropping both her phone and purse before she glared at him; smacking his chest before she dipped to pick up her things. He knelt before she could, scooping up her purse and phone before extending them to her. She took them with a nod, reaching up to push her hair out of her face; grimacing at the long mess before she shrugged it off. She'd threatened to cut it the last time she and her brother had talked only for Khail to freak, all but forbidding her to go under the shears unless he was with her. Which had only gave her another reason to count down the seconds until his release because the hair was going. Sphinx shifted, glancing back to the car before he turned to her; giving her an indescribable look as they just stood there. After a few long awkward moments she sighed, crossing her arms as she looked to him expectantly. She knew they were seeing one another now-and that since they'd made that decision they'd eased up on the physical to build the rest but seriously? Why was he looking at her like this? \"Jesus, Sphinx. What? \" His look darkened before he rolled his eyes, giving her a pointed look she understood all too well. He wanted to know what she was doing-or more to the point where she was going. But she wasn't about to let him get of that easily. If he wanted to know he could ask-like a normal fucking boyfriend. He could call and text her a few times a day to discuss her stance on children- eventually for both of them shockingly enough -; boosting- again, both could take it or leave it at this point - and her recreational habits-s he smoked, he could get over it or not but damn it she had a VALID medical card so there ! So she knew he could ask questions . . . he just didn't always want to go through the hassle. \"You said earlier you weren't busy tonight. So I figured we could do out, grab some dinner-do a proper night. Maybe head to the boardwalk.\" She sighed, looking skyward as she fought the urge to roll her eyes. God why today? Why on the one day she needed to be somewhere else did he decide to be sweet and random? And why was it on the one damn day that her boyfriend wanted to be sweet did she have to go and deal with the Raines? Oh yeah, because she'd been dumb enough to answer the phone. She ran her hands down her face before covering her mouth, looking to him through her spread fingers before she sighed again. God this was not what they needed . . . but Penn had been too happy, too excited for her to cancel. \"I can't. Memphis called about two hours ago and asked if I wanted to go with them to the movies. Penn's first movie. The Starlite Drive-In is playing Disney movies all week so Kip and Memphis wanted to take her, you know. Get her out of the house-\" Sphinx's face fell dangerously neutral, the tightening at the corner of his eyes the only indicator that he wasn't pleased about her decision. But seriously what did he expect? They both had pretty busy lives outside of each other-and she wasn't going to cancel on Penn. Memphis and Kip would be tossed aside in half a heartbeat for all the aggravation they usually caused but Pennelope hadn't done anything to deserve that. At least not to her. She moved, reaching out to catch him when he pulled back; shaking his head as he went to step off the porch. \"Hey! C'mon! I didn't know you had this planned! If you'd said something earlier I would've said no when they called. You could always come-\" He turned eyes hard and hot as he snapped at her. But oddly enough his words didn't hurt her as much as the hurt coiling beneath his expression did. She bit her lip, letting him have his say-just this once- before she caught his hand; threading their fingers together. \"Oh its fine. Blow me off ta go traipse all over hell and creation with Raines. You've done it enough.\" Ripley sighed before she stretched up, trying desperately to ignore the painful twisting in her chest as she brushed her lips over his cheek; squeezing his hand once before she stepped away and moved towards her own Chevelle. She didn't give him time to react, sliding in the driver's side and cranked the car; pulling out and onto Pelican before he was ever even off the porch. When she stopped for her first stop sign she checked her makeup in the rearview, wiping at her eyes before she readjusted the mirror. It hurt to do it but this was one of the things she couldn't budge on. Not because she didn't want to-because God did she want nothing more than to go out with him and just enjoy what they were trying to make-but because she wasn't the only one affected. It still didn't make this any easier. Ripley closed her eyes, trying desperately not to snap as Tumbler reached across the center console to chase Penn's box of candy. She still didn't completely understand how all of this happened-how she'd agreed to come and watch the Disney marathon at the Starlite Drive In but she was here. With Penn bouncing across her and Tumbler's laps as she cheered and chattered, completely and totally enthralled by Sleeping Beauty on the screen. Tumbler caught the candy, rolling his eyes as he handed it back to Penn; his eyes giving away his aggravation even though his voice seemed even and cordial. \" Here , Penn. Try not to toss 'em in the floor again. Alright?\" Penn stopped cheering long enough to take the candy with a nod, only to screech and jump as Maleficent changed from a woman to a dragon, hissing at the Prince. Ripley turned to the screen, rolling her eyes before she sighed; only to have to bite her lip as Penn's box of Nerds fell to the floorboard of Tumbler's Nova. Again. Ripley turned, trying hard not to laugh as Tumbler groaned and leaned into the floor again; gathering up the tiny candies as he grumbled and groused. But seriously what had he expected? The Raines family was-even on their best behavior- primarily comprised of impulsive assholes . . . and while Penn was still little and cute she had far too much Raines in her to be anything but a pain when she set her mind to it. Not to mention she'd inherited a substantial dose of Sway's devil-may-care attitude when it came to hearing the word 'No' . \"I can't believe I got stuck with this shit, man. You , I can see but me? Why did I have to come to the freaking movies?\" Ripley blinked, reaching out and handing Penn the car speaker; covering the little girl's free ear as she turned to glare at Tumbler. He couldn't be serious . . . right?! \"Uh, because your ex showed up plastered and half dressed? Singing and stumbling and begging for someone to-what was it she was screaming when I talked to Kip? Oh yeah. ' Just do me already !'\" Tumbler's cheeks suddenly shone red in the dark interior of the Nova, his eyes moving to rest anywhere but on her as he shrugged; muttering as he sank back into his seat. The younger boost crossed his arms, glaring out the window as he slumped behind the wheel; his fingers twisting a piece of the frayed leather cuff he usually wore. \"Yeah well she's my ex for a reason. I couldn't handle all of the partying and shit she does. I mean who gets shitfaced by six o clock on a fucking Thursday?\" Ripley shrugged, rolling her eyes again before she let her hand fall from Penn's ears; sighing in relief as the toddler barely reacted. Oh thank God for small favors. Because she didn't want to explain to Junie why Penn popped up with more horrible words added to her vocabulary. The bastard stunt the month before had been bad enough . . . and Sphinx still wouldn't own up to being the first one to say it-regardless of the fact that Atley and Hex had sold him out quick to save their own skins from the Halliwell Matriarch. She stilled, her fingers moving to the phone in her pocket before she stopped herself. He was the one being a jerk, not responding to messages and calls because she'd refused to cancel on Memphis. How was she supposed to know that the one night in almost two years that Sphinx actually wanted to go and get dinner-versus them arguing before falling in bed together only to argue again- was the one night she'd promised to go with the Raines brothers to take Penn to her first movie? It wasn't like he'd told her anything . He'd just shown up at her home right as she'd being leaving, brow raised at the better pair of her jeans and the semi dressy shirt and cardigan. Demanding to know where she thought she was going before becoming angry when she wouldn't cancel once she'd named a location. But therein lay the problem. Part of her had wanted nothing more than to call Memphis and claim something had come up, to go out with Sphinx and just try to enjoy being with him. But the rest of her had thought of how excited Penn had been when she'd heard they were going to the Drive-In. About how happy and downright sickening all of her little giggles had been before she'd thrown herself around Memphis's knees; laughing and clapping before she'd attacked her. She wasn't cold enough to break that kid's heart . . . so Sphinx had pitched a fit and damn near shattered hers. Because God forbid he actually go with them. A nudge to her shoulder made her turn, worried blue eyes meeting hers as Tumbler looked to her expectantly. What had they been talking about? She sighed, running a hand down her face before she gave him a repentant look. \"Sorry. My mind's a million different places right now, Tumbler.\" Tumbler was still for a few moments before he nodded once, settling back into his seat before he turned and looked to the screen. Something she was thankful for. Atley was really the only one who knew she was such a basketcase, the others always staying a respectful distance because of her attitude and overall charming personality. But as she turned back to the screen warm fingers caught hers, a strong calloused hand looping around hers comfortably as Penn sighed and settled back against her chest. Ripley waited, not daring to breathe as Penn sighed and rolled, nuzzling her little cheek against her collarbone as tiny fingers came to grip at her sweater sleepily. But none of that was as shocking as what came next. The hand holding hers lifted it from her lap, bringing her knuckles to brush against surprisingly soft lips before their hands fell to rest on the center console. She swallowed the lump in her suspiciously dry throat, chancing a glance at Tumbler as Penn started to snore lightly. She cut her eyes across the cabin of the car, trying not to flinch at the way that Tumbler was looking to her. His eyes weren't troubled anymore, his face soft and thoughtful even though his lips were tugging to the side in a small smirk. But this wasn't one of the smiles she was used to. This wasn't cocky and arrogant, this wasn't infuriating and it didn't make her want to throttle him. This was a real, warm smile. The kind she and her brother-their crew had traded for years before they'd all gone away. She shifted, unsure of how to handle this when he spoke; making her flinch before she could stop herself. She only ever spent time with Atley-at least until the past month had brought them Penn. Hell she didn't even see Sphinx as much as she did the Raines and Jackson . . . and she'd been sharing a bed with him for almost two years. So to have to deal with this, to hear another person just start talking and opening up was odd. But surprisingly not unbearable. \"She loves the shit outta you. You know that right?\" Ripley blinked, hating that her cheeks were probably purple as she nodded; shifting Penn as she whimpered and rolled. She glanced down, pushing the girl's curls from her face; momentarily awed by how at peace she looked. Here was main reason people were beginning to take all of her bluster and bullshit and toss it aside; forcing her to become more a part of a crew she'd deliberately kept herself on the outskirts of. Because crews couldn't be trusted-not without blood running through their veins. Hell sometimes not even then! But Jackson had pushed her to come back years before, to take up with his people while her own did time . . . and now she had a toddler running around calling her 'Auntie'. God what had happened to her life? And why didn't she care? She shook herself, shrugging as Tumbler squeezed her hand reassuringly. The little action made her blush darker but she smiled to him in spite of it, nodding once before she turned to watch Penn sleep. \"I'm beginning to see that. At first I was sure that as soon as we hit Long Beach she would latch onto Junie and that would be that. But now . . . Hell I think I'd be insulted if she didn't run right for me when I walk into ya'll's house.\" Tumbler grinned, chuckling as he nodded before his face fell. \"I doubt you have to worry about that. *SIGH* I just wish she liked me a little better.\" Ripley turned, raising a brow before she rolled her eyes; waving him off even as he started to defend himself. \"Oh whatever. She follows the three of you around like some lost little duckling-\" \"But she doesn't like me, Ripley. She loves Memphis and Kip but she barely stands me. She throws things at me when I tell her no, she tries to bite me when I try to keep her from eating shit she shouldn't. Hell yesterday she told Memphis that she didn't want me to live there anymore! That she wanted him to marry you so you could be her new mom and live with them! WHAT?! \" Tumbler watched as Ripley bit her lip, trying not to laugh but he knew-with the shake of her shoulders that it was useless. She started cackling, finally resorting to burying her face in Penn's curls as the little girl stirred. The toddler looked around the car for a few moments before bleary sleepy eyes trained on Ripley; a tiny brow rising before she rolled her eyes and huffed. The toddler swatted at Ripley, the action just making her laugh even harder. \"Auntie Ripley! I was sleepin' . . . Why're you laughing?\" Ripley continued to giggled, smoothing Penn's hair back down as the girl shifted and resettled. Grumbling sleepily as she reached up to grab a handful of her fishtail braid to cuddle in her sleep. \"Sorry sweetpea. I got tickled. Just go back to sleep okay? I won't wake you up again.\" Penn huffed, burying her face in Ripley's shirt half muffling the sound. Tumbler rolled his eyes, turning away from Ripley as her giggles started to subside; hating that he'd embarrassed himself in front of the older boost. When Ripley had shown up with Hex and the others, Kip had very bluntly informed the rest of their crew to leave her alone. That he'd seen and heard her tear into people for the smallest things when he'd been younger . . . and that the two of them had never been able to tolerate one another for very long. Sure it hadn't even taken Raines two weeks to recant, only warning them not to touch her as he swore she'd mellowed enough to be semi-friendly but the initial warning had stuck with the Youngbloods. And the quirky blonde had officially become off limits, unless they were running with her. Then it was every man for himself. Which had led Tumbler to try and make sure he was the man who went out with her as often as he could. He knew it was slightly suicidal but without Sway there were far too many men in their ragtag little group. And he'd never been able to say no to pretty blonde with big blue eyes. Okay so Ripley's were more blue green but she was definitely the type he usually went for. Tough, smart enough not to get caught and able to take care of herself . . . but her attitude had kept him from ever offering to take her out. The girl hadn't seemed all too happy to be with them most days-and with the way Sphinx seemed intent to rile her up it was almost understandable- but over the past month he'd watched something amazing happen. Ripley had softened enough to be approachable-so long as Penn was handy. And the more she softened, the harder Tumbler had to work to not make an idiot out of himself. He huffed, going to draw his hand back when she stopped him; squeezing his hand as she gave him a soft smile. He blinked, stunned as she nodded; shifting to keep Penn close as she leaned across and laid her head on his shoulder. Tumbler held his breath, deathly still for a few long moments before she nudged him in the side hard; causing him to jerk. \"Quit freaking out, Tumbler-Its nothing like that. Sitting like this with an extra twenty pounds of weight isn't exactly comfortable. You don't mind do you?\" Tumbler shook his head, tightening his grip on her hand slightly before he settled back to watch the credits for Sleeping Beauty roll by. He knew they should probably leave, that the Raines brothers had more than enough time to banish the skank from their home but he couldn't. Not with Ripley leaning against him and Penn snoring peacefully away in her arms. He shifted, glancing down as Penn sighed and rolled; the quiet moment broken as he and Ripley scrambling to keep the toddler from falling before she sat up suddenly. She rubbed at her eyes, glaring at them for laughing before she huffed and closed her eyes again; making tight fists in Ripley's hair as she snorted. \" Stop moving, Auntie Ripley. Uncle Tommy-make her stop moving!\" Tumbler sputtered before he caught himself, fixing Ripley with his sternest look and deepest voice as he issued Penn's order. \"Alright you heard her. Stop moving Auntie Ripley.\" Ripley rolled her eyes and smacked him, moving to pester Penn awake just out of spite as the girl whined and squirmed. But when her whines turned to laughter, Tumbler finally let himself go; cackling as Penn moved and crawled into his lap. Glaring at Ripley even as she fought to stop giggling. \"Stop being silly! Uncle Tommy makes her stop!\" God what a weird way to spend a Thursday. And thats all for now folks. Later.[Chapter 20] Sorry its been so long everyone but life never seems to go smoothly around my neck of the woods. I won't bore anyone with the details so we can get right into this. The next few chapters aren't going to focus as much around Penn but more on the adults-a few certain adults to be precise. Yes I know in parts this one gets a little sappy but hey, its a new relationship. Thank you to everyone who has faved, reviewed and PMed me during my time away. It means the world to me! On with the show! Oh and we might be upping the rating on this story to M. Not quite sure yet . . . Resolve Ripley sighed as she waved to Penn and Tumbler from behind the wheel, thankful to be back in her own car as she watched the two pull out of Otto's. The night hadn't been too horrible and she'd discovered that without the others around Tumbler was actually pretty decent - if not a little touchier than she'd originally thought . She'd also learned that he had absolutely no clue how to handle Penn -but then again none of them did. Even if it seemed like the toddler ran ramshod over the clueless boost a little more than she did the rest of them. She waited until the lights of the Nova were gone, sagging in her seat as she let her head fall to her steering wheel. While she'd been with them it had been easy enough to push Sphinx out of her mind but now that she was alone she was having trouble. He hadn't returned any of her texts and he wasn't at the shop; meaning that unless she wanted to come clean to Atley- something neither of them were really ready to do- then she'd just have to suck it up and wait. Something she knew he knew she absolutely loathed doing. She sat up straight, reaching for her seatbelt as her phone rang; her hands going to it far quicker than they should have. Her eyes scanned the faceplate, her lip firmly between her teeth as she watched his number dance across her screen. But the question was did she answer it? He'd pitched his fit earlier and she'd done her stupid thing by walking away instead of settling it; so where in the hell did they go from here? And why was it proving to be so damned difficult for them to actually be together? Ripley watched the phone for a second more before she clicked the SEND button, bringing it to her ear as she cranked the Chevelle. \"Hello?\" Silence met her on the line, reminding her of a million other times they'd been on the phone before she rolled her eyes. God for someone who was actually kind of eloquent with words (when he chose to be mind you) the man loathed to speak unless he had to. Something that was making this a lot harder than it should've rightly been. She sighed, closing her eyes as she sagged against the wheel again; trying to keep her cool as she heard him shift on the other side of the phone. Finally she had enough of listening to him breath, moving to hit the END button just as he spoke. \" Oh fer fuck's sake- Ripley? \" She blinked, stunned by how exasperated he sounded; wondering what had happened while she'd been on Toddler-and-Tumbler detail. \"Yeah? What's wrong?\" He sighed into the phone, his aggravation almost palatable as he started to grouse; actually grumbling to her over the phone like he was Atley or Hex. What in the hell was going on now? \" Now why would anything be wrong? It's not like you just up and left before I had a chance to fucking talk to you. You just took off as soon you were able without even -*SIGH* And now Atley's calling me to lay down the law. 'Bout how I need to lighten up on you on account of Tumbler saying something to Kip.\" Her brows furrowed as she shifted in her seat, suddenly dreading whatever came next. She'd known that something was off at the theatre but she hadn't pushed, just letting things play out the way they had. It wasn't like she thought of Tumbler that way- and she didn't honestly think he did about her either. She cleared her throat, deciding to go ahead and do this-regardless of how badly she didn't want to. \"What? What do you mean something Tumbler said to Kip? He just fucking left not even fifteen minutes ago-\" Sphinx snorted, interrupting her. \" Oh he's had plenty o time to bitch and meddle. Called Kip and Memphis-who called Atley to tell me to lighten up on you. Cause Tumbler's sweet enough on you that he might get mad if I pick at you how I normally do. Is there something I need to know, Ripley? Have you and the boy been going on and you haven't said anything?\" She stilled, knowing he didn't ask that question unless he was extremely pissed. Even before Sphinx had never pushed or talked about the possibility that she could've seen other people, always saying he knew she had her boyfriends and didn't need to be reminded. But the problem was Tumbler wasn't one of them-he never had been. Hell there hadn't even been anyone but Sphinx in a year and a half! \"No, Sphinx. I haven't-we didn't *SIGH* Jesus Christ! Why do they always have to do this shit?! Can't they just leave something alone?! \" She took in a deep breath, trying to calm herself as she ran a shaking hand down her face. They were too fresh, too new in this for something like this to pop up. This could very easily ruin every fucking thing that she'd wanted for over a year. And if it did she would slaughter every person responsible- even Atley . \"Where are you? Because we need to sit down and talk about this-actually see one another face to face.\" He was quiet for a few moments before he spoke, his voice nowhere near as angry though it was still raw. And even though she knew it wasn't her best idea she ran with the thought that crossed through her mind; praying to herself that they could fix the damage the others had made meddling. Sphinx shifted in his bed, slowly sliding from the covers before he pulled them over Ripley; making sure she was covered before he moved down the hallway into his kitchen. He crossed to the fridge, cracking open a beer and draining half before he braced himself against the sink; running a hand down his face as he tried to collect himself. When he'd opened the door to his apartment, he'd been in no way prepared for the flurry of mouth and arms that Ripley became once she set eyes on him. But it hadn't stopped him from responding, scooping her up as soon as the door was shut; moving them through the living room and hall to his bedroom. He'd eagerly listened as she'd kissed him, soaking up every word and touch like his life had depended on it; never once doubting her as he'd wiped the almost manic tears from her eyes. Even now he knew she was telling the truth about earlier in the evening; knew from her frantic worried kisses and almost panicked reassurances that there hadn't been anything between her and the boy. But the problem still remained that Tumbler might want there to be. He sighed, taking another long drink as he worked through his options; coming to the conclusion that their privacy was about to end. He didn't want the others involved, knew in the back of his mind that no one was going to be happy to see him and his girl together out in the open but there didn't seem to be any other way. Not without committing murder. He closed his eyes, letting his head lull and hang as he came to grips with the decision. Tomorrow he would come clean to Atley-and tell him to pass the information to the others. Christ this was going to be a fresh new hell if there ever was one. Movement behind him made him turn just as cool hands slid up his back, a sleepy sigh brushing against his skin as Ripley rested her cheek over his left shoulder blade. Her hands wound around his middle, his own covering hers before he even considered the action. It was easier to do this here, to feel content with another person now that he knew she was as dedicated to him as he was to her. He squeezed her hands before he moved, turning in the noose of her arms to gather her closer; resting his chin atop her curls as she leaned into his chest. She shifted, pressing a sleepy kiss over his heart before she laid her cheek against his chest; her voice deep and husky as she fought to stay awake. If things could stay like this, the two of them just content to settle their differences and work to be together then things would be fine-damn near perfect. Too bad it would all come crashing down as soon as he made a fucking phone call. \"Penny for your thoughts.\" He smirked despite himself, rolling his eyes at the quip. Nostalgia was something that was usually wasted on him but hearing her ask him that; the same little quirky question she'd used on their first night together brought the feeling forth on its own. It was hard to believe that it'd been so long since their explosive chemistry had finally come to such an odd conclusion; longer still since their initial clashes and brawls. But as they stood there together, contented and basking in the afterglow he knew he wouldn't have it any other way. She was irritating and nerve racking but she was his . . . and he wasn't about to risk losing that again just because he didn't want the others snooping about. He snorted to himself, tightening his grip on her as he pressed a kiss to her curls. If anything the morgue would get new residents if the lads got too aggravating-or invasive. \"Nothing, Love. Just deciding the best way to tell Atley.\" Ripley pulled back, raising a brow at him as she started to wake up a little more; the sated sleepy edge leaving her eyes as they became clouded and troubled. Her lips tugged down into a frown, her hands moving to slide around his waist to his stomach; tracing up his abs to rest on his chest as she looked up to him beseechingly. \" Why? I mean, if you're not ready to do this then we don't have to. I want them to know eventually, Sphinx but right now might not be the best time to break this. Especially with everyone reeling from Sway-\" He sighed, cupping her cheek; dipping to give her a pointed look. He'd known she wouldn't want him to do this, that despite her claims the month before she wasn't any readier to deal with the others than he was. But this was something that needed to be done . . . and to be completely honest he was eager to see what could become of them with the others in the know. If it didn't destroy them that is . \"If we wait until everything's settled it could be months-maybe longer. I'm not in the habit of doing anything by anyone else's schedule . . . and the sooner we do this the sooner we can put it behind us. Besides -\" He shifted, tracing her cheek with his thumb as she closed her eyes; leaning into the touch as she sighed. \"I'll not have the others dictating what happens in our lives. If you'd had a problem with me outside o this then you would say. It's not Atley's place ta order and command my behavior-and it sure as hell isn't Tumbler's. \" Ripley cracked an eye at him before she snorted, rolling both as she grumbled. \"I had a problem with your behavior before we talked all of this through, jackass. Which is why Atley's saying something- not just because of Tumbler and Kip. He's like family, Sphinx. And it's worried him for a while the way we went at each other. Hell it worried me! You can't blame him-\" \"I can blame him for meddling-same as the others. And if it was really so bad then he shoulda come to me, talked to me the same as he does with anyone else. Its bloody insulting the way they all pussyfoot around telling me anything unpleasant-and Jackson knows that. Just like he knows that despite everything else I always stood with him for you. He-\" Ripley's face softened as she nodded, easing up to press her lips against his; the touch soft and sweet as her hands splayed across his chest. \"I know, honey. Just like I don't appreciate the way he thinks I'm made out of glass . . . but Atley's always worried. Fretted and planned for every possible contingency. He's paranoid-always has been. Its why he and my brother got along so damned well. But I get it. If you think this is best then I'm for it. I'll talk to Char and Hex in the morning alright? If anything they'll help keep him in check . . . Do you want to tell Memphis or let Atley?\" Sphinx shrugged, running his nose down hers; the hand on her cheek moving to knot in the curls at the base of her skull as she leaned into him a little heavier. \"Fuck it. Let Jackson tell all of 'em for all I care. It'll all mesh out in the end. Do you work tomorrow?\" She nodded as much as grip would let her, her arms over his shoulders as her lips ghosted over his. \"Yeah. As a matter of fact I have a lot to do tomorrow-between meeting the contractor Char knows and going to check on Tome and Spyder. But tomorrow night should be a little easier-if you don't count my late dinner and drinking plans . . .\" He quirked a brow, his interest piqued before he could stop it. \"Oh really? And who am I gonna be buryin' then?\" She laughed, rolling her eyes; kissing the corner of his lips before she slipped away from him to steal a drink of his beer. \"God! So jealous! I was talking about us , jackass. Unless you have other plans . . .\"[Chapter 21] So before anyone points it out yes the first tiny part is very similar to the first morning in Coffee-but its for a reason. A reader asked me how this first morning would go and I wanted to do this parallel kind of to show the differences. As for what differences you'll see. Now I also want to point out that yes there is a little extracurricular substance use in this chapter and I apologize if it offends anyone . . . but PLEASE do not send me a million flames over talking about pot. I'm not promoting or condoning; it's just fiction. So no one go and say this crazy broad on was preaching the praises of reefer. Or you can, whatever. Hope you enjoy it. Wake Ripley rolled, trying to get comfortable as she shifted in her bed. But no matter what she did she couldn't seem to get to the middle. Which was odd seeing as in that was usually where she slept; spread out in the middle of her bed and burrowed into as many pillows and covers as she could pile on said bed. It wasn't the world's oddest habit or guilty pleasure but it was hers . . . and considering the fact that she'd slept on a pull out sofa bed most of her teen years and even into her twenties it was one she frequently indulged in. So why the fuck couldn't she get to her spot? She grimaced, sitting up half asleep and pushing at the large pillow that refused to move. Where in the hell had she found this thing? It was lumpy and hard and it was hot-very, very HOT. She moved again, pushing at the heavy lump in earnest as her mind started to wake up, bits and pieces of the room becoming clearer as she blinked into awareness. But when the pillow grunted she felt her heart stop. She shook herself, trying to make her eyes stay open as she looked over the sleeping form beside her. She reached down, pinching herself before she opened her eyes again. But the same sight was still waiting on her . . . she just couldn't get her sleep fogged mind to remember what had happened last night. Actually she couldn't remember much of yesterday period, other than nearly killing herself trying to drink away her dread over today. She stilled, watching the man sigh deeply as he moved; letting her see just how damned relaxed he looked while he was unconscious. And slowly the events of last night started to flood back to her. She reached up, running a hand through her stiff and tangled hair before she eased out of the bed carefully. No need to wake him up because she had to get ready to go to work - Work! Christ what time was it?! She glanced around, trying to find a working clock before she finally riffled through her purse to find her cell phone. 9:38 am. She groaned, going to her closet and grabbing the nearest outfit she could as quietly as possible. Not only had Sphinx stayed the night but now she'd overslept too! And on the damn day that she had to go all the way to Seal Beach to meet the contractor before she went to check on things at the shop. She moved, shimmying the raw silk and cashmere tunic over her head, smoothing it down over her French shorts and the bra she'd inadvertently worn to bed last night. She barely glanced at the jersey black and white stripes trying to peak through the almond pink cashmere overlay before she grabbed the dark French gray fitted Member's Only jacket from the back of her closet, tossing it on over the tunic and adjusting the sleeves as she scanned her shoes for something she could move in quickly. There was a pair of her better jeans tossed over her dryer-meaning she could wear any shoe she wanted without worrying over the length of the sleeveless shirt . . . and to think when Paul gave it to her he'd sworn the damn thing was supposed to be a dress! She turned, almost crowing for joy as she spotted her black cowboy boots, grabbing them as she scuttled out of her closet and through her bedroom; stopping at her tiny laundry cubby long enough to locate her jeans. She opened the dryer when she couldn't find them, tossing clothes this way and that before she growled; settling on a lighter ripped pair when she couldn't find the others. What did it matter anyway? She was just meeting the contractor to discuss the renovations her Mother's old house would need. If he had a problem with how she looked or dressed she would tell him to fuck off and find someone else. Right after her nervous breakdown of course. Ripley tugged the jeans up and over her hips; making sure everything was straight and closed before she picked up the discarded boots. She twisted and squirmed in place; maneuvering into the damn things one at a time as she tried not to fall and break her neck in her kitchen. As soon as her boots where on she ran from the tiny cubby, stopping long enough to look over the information Char had given her about the foreman before she groaned. It was damn near ten o clock and she was supposed to be in Seal Beach by 10:30. God she was going to be so freaking late! She stopped; running her hands down her face as she tried to gather herself. Okay, this just wasn't doable with how late she'd slept . . . and she'd rather have the contractor be a little peeved at her for rescheduling than make him wait for the hour it would take her to get there. Especially with the traffic around Long Beach and her less than stellar luck. She turned to her coffee pot and hit the button without a second thought, shifting through the mess of papers on her counters a little less frantically now that she wasn't freaking out. She scanned the contact list, dialing the number as soon as she saw the name she needed; only to turn and nearly fall as she tripped over one of the shirts she tossed around in her jean quest. She huffed, praying as she listened to the phone ring that the man would just answer as she started gathering up her mess; shaking her head at her own stupidity. God why was she being such a fucking spazoid today? Finally after the eighth ring a gruff voice filled the phone, the muffled background voices and noise making her feel bad for interrupting but she couldn't help it. She needed to do this so she could stay sane . . . and she knew the man would probably appreciate not having to wait outside in the sun until she could get there. \" Gregson.\" \"Hi, Mr. Gregson? Its Ripley Guadimus-we have an appointment at 10:30?\" She listened to him move before the other noises disappeared, his voice seeming less hassled as he sighed into the phone. \" Yes, Ms. Guadimus we do. I was actually trying to wrap up another consult so I can get on the road. Unexpected foundation problems with another project have kept us pretty tied up most of the morning so a fair warning it might be a while before I can make my way out to Seal Beach.\" Ripley closed her eyes, letting her head fall back as she sighed in relief. Oh thank you God. She knew it wasn't exactly right but if something like this could happen it couldn't have picked a better day. \"Actually that's fine. I got caught up with some things myself. Is there any way we can try for later today? Maybe after noon?\" \" Ma'am that would be fantastic. I'm hoping to be done here by eleven at the latest . . . but I'm going to say 1:30 just to be safe. It's been one of those mornings, you know?\" Ripley nodded, laughing into the phone as she turned to open her smallest kitchen drawer; tugging a fresh pack of cigarettes free before she dug deeper for a lighter. \"Trust me sir, I can believe it. I'll see you at 1:30-but if something comes up this is my cell. We can always try again on my next day off. Is there anything I need to bring with me other than what Char brought?\" The man on the other end double checked the paperwork, telling her to find a copy of the deed just to be safe as he took down the number for the shop before he hung up; leaving her to look around her semi destroyed kitchen as she packed her cigs and waited on the coffee. After she smoked and had at least two cups she would call Tome to let him know she'd be in later than expected-maybe even see if she could skip it all together. She didn't really have anything on the books, just coverage for walk ins and consults. She nodded; opening the pack and pulling free a clove, lighting it and inhaling deeply as she sagged against the counter. Only then realizing that for all the drama she'd solved she still had an issue snoring away in her bed. Why in the hell had Sphinx randomly decided to try the whole sleep over shit the night before she had so fucking much to do? Sphinx rolled away from the sun shining on his face, burrowing deeper into the warm covers and soft pillows before he realized two very important things. One it was far later than he normally woke up if the sun was trying to blind him. And two whatever bed he was in was far too soft to be his. Meaning he wasn't at home. He blinked back to awareness, running a hand over his face as he yawned; glancing around the room as he realized where he was. And-more to the point- whose bed he was in. He sighed, closing his eyes as he decided not to worry about all of the complications his decision last night had dredged up as he reached out to pull the girl closer. Intent to just enjoy the quiet morning and the overall sated feeling he had as long as it lasted. But when his arm hit an empty mattress he furrowed his brows. He looked over, seeing that not only was she not there but-judging from how cold the bed was- that she'd been gone a while. He sat up, looking around and trying to see or hear her moving around the small house but to no avail. He could hear the waves and the wind, the few scattered birds and even the traffic in the distance-but no Ripley. Had she seriously just run off and left him alone in her home? God she was far more trusting than he'd thought-or she'd been in a rush and forgotten he was here. Equally probable possibilities that just made him roll his eyes. It figured that the one woman who wanted anything to do with him that wasn't insane-Ripley was crazy but in a way he was becoming partial to- or some kind of agenda driven harpy from the bowels of hell would have to be scatterbrained in the morning. Boosting cars and gang wars she could handle without flinching. But expecting her to remember something before she'd been awake two hours was beyond pointless. And by God he wasn't going to feel badly about it. Last night had been something completely different than he'd been expecting-a large divergence from the norm for both of them. Her soft kisses and little touches hadn't left him disgruntled the way a timid lover usually did. Actually her zeal and overall eagerness to touch him and be touched, to please him and just be with him had made the whole thing seem almost surreal; like they were coming together for the first time rather than continuing a nearly two year affair. He'd honestly never had a lover like her-had a night like the one before. And the knowledge that all of this could possibly continue just made him hopeful rather than dreadful. Hell the sex alone would be worth putting up with any aggravation she caused him. Sphinx smirked before he stretched and stepped out of her bed slowly; testing his still weak and wobbly legs-now that was a definite first- as he looked over her bedroom in the daylight. After Atley's stunt-and Ripley's arrival at his home- he'd made the decision to take their relationship public; to cut all of the subterfuge and bullshit off before it could even begin. Ripley hadn't completely seen his point but she'd agreed with decision . . . only to disagree when he'd told her that he wanted her to spend the night. Sphinx sighed, reaching up and smoothing his hair down as he tried to wake up, refusing to let himself become as irritated as he had the night before. Ripley had been quick to explain that she wasn't averse to spending the night, only that the errands she had to run and the overly full schedule for the rest of her day today meant she wouldn't be able to stay. So he'd done the next best thing and told her-if she was willing-that he would stay with her. He'd spent enough time around the awkward girl's home as it was; he knew his way around her neighborhood and could be ready to go by time she needed to leave. It all seemed logical at the time . . . so why was he waking up by himself far later than he should? And why did he find himself almost disappointed that they hadn't woken up together? He shook himself, looking around for his clothes when he spotted them; folded neatly with his cellphone and wallet laid across them. He quirked a brow, picking up his phone before he shook his head; smirking softly at the daft little thing before he frowned. So he'd been right; she'd overslept and run off to do what she needed to; leaving him to his own devices until she could get back later in the day. Meaning that he was completely and utterly alone in her home. Now what in the hell was he supposed to do? Ripley inhaled as she leaned back into her patio chair, eyes closed as she let the smoke sit in her lungs; the warm morning sun beating down on her now bare feet as she lounged and waited. She sat the glass piece back into the large amber glass ashtray on the side table; careful not to ding or chip either before she let her hands fall into her lap. She'd shed her boots the second she'd gotten off the phone with Gregson, resolving herself to digging out her flats as soon as Sphinx was awake and out of her bed. But until then she couldn't seem to force herself to do any of the random chores she normally would on a slow morning, instead deciding to enjoy the rare quiet as she waited. She exhaled just as her back door opened the rest of the way; Sphinx stepping out cautiously before he spotted her and shook his head. He crossed her back porch, stopping just behind her chair as she took another hit from the bowl in the ashtray beside her. She knew he didn't smoke-not that he really cared that she did; she'd asked and he'd sworn that it was her choice-but she'd still refrained from exposing him to it. With what she did no one really cared if she took the occasional toke but Sphinx was different. He had a good legal job, one that entailed drug tests and rather unforgiving bosses if something ever went wrong. And she wasn't going to be even slightly responsible for costing him what he'd worked so hard to accomplish. She watched him eye the piece before he shrugged, dropping into the chair beside her bonelessly as his fingers looped through hers; his eyes on the water just beyond the dunes and the rickety fence. Ripley bit her lip before she turned, picking the piece up with her free hand and stowing it into the little drawer in the wooden table; carefully but quickly tucking it away before she settled back into her seat. Only to nearly jump out of her skin when he snorted. \"You didn't have to do that, you know. I'm not bothered by a little smoke.\" She rolled her eyes before she shrugged, squeezing his hand reassuringly before she glanced to her phone; checking the time before she flipped the lid close with a loud snap. \"I know I didn't but you don't smoke. I do the same thing for Atley and Char-out of respect. I don't expect people to just be okay with all of my habits; and I'm not stupid enough to parade them around when I know they make other people uncomfortable. Hell you should've seen Atley when Paul brought me the hookah tucked away in my closet. He almost shit himself before he tried to play it off.\" Sphinx cut his eyes to her, one brow raised as he nodded to her to continue. She chuckled, getting a better grip on his hand before she leaned back into her chair; both of them relaxing as she began telling him about her birthday five years before. \"Paul always goes overboard on gifts, you know? Gets the biggest craziest thing he can just to see my reaction-or to see how I'm going to hide it. But when I turned twenty-four he went a little overboard . . . even for him. Two days before my birthday he shows up with this trunk. Atley was here for me to stitch up his leg-from that fall where he busted open the scar tissue from his wreck? And he starts moaning and groaning the second Paul walked through the door.\" Sphinx chuckled but nodded, turning in his seat to look at her as she started to laugh. \"I can imagine that. Lord knows I've heard Jackson bitch about your friend enough.\" Ripley rolled her eyes but didn't comment refusing to rise to the bait he was setting. It was too nice a day and she was far too relaxed to ruin it-even if picking and bickering with him was one of her favorite pastimes. \"Oh trust me, I know. I swear there are some days all Atley does is complain. But back to the point Paul had this client at his salon right? This middle aged photojournalist that was kinda kooky and just randomly grabbed things from wherever he went for work. Well, really long story short the guy was moving out of state . . . and he had to get rid of some of his more controversial memorabilia because he couldn't figure out a way to ship them without raising all of these red flags. So Paul starts asking what he has and the guy tells him about this hookah he'd stumbled across while he was in Pakistan; tells him it's really intricate and it's never been smoked out of.\" Sphinx blinked before his brows drew together, his lips tugging into a thin line. \"Why? The bloke not know how to use it or something?\" Ripley shook her head laughing, squeezing his hand again. \"Even better. He'd bought it while he was on assignment for his sister-and once he brought it back to her she'd told him she didn't want it. So this big beautiful thing sat unused for like fifteen years-right on this guy's coffee table! He had pictures of it and all the other odds and ends he'd collect in his portfolio. So Paul told him they could trade. That he would do his hair, waxing, mani/pedis and cover his white patches for the rest of the time he was in Long Beach . . . if he would let him have the hookah and the cowskin rug that's in my living room. Which was my real birthday present just to let you know.\" Sphinx shook his head, turning back to the waves with a chuckle. \"I take it he agreed then. So how's Atley play into it?\" Ripley grinned, almost bouncing in her seat as she turned to face him completely; gesturing wildly with her free hand as she explained Atley's reaction to the gag gift. \"Well he was here because he refused to go back to the Docs-\" Sphinx huffed, rolling his eyes. \"Because he'd already busted the bottom o that scar and the Doc told him to stay off it.\" \"So he comes to me at freaking sundown and practically begs me to stitch him up. Paul walked in when I was about halfway through cleaning up the mess he'd made of the stitches; carrying this bulky trunk in one hand with the cowskin rug tossed over his shoulder. He throws the rug down and starts pulling out the hookah, putting it together and setting up the charcoal like he'd done it a million times. While Atley just sits there and stares at him like he's crazy. Everything was okay until he went to load it with shirshin and then Atley fucking freaked. Stood up and started going on and on about how I didn't need to have something like that before he demanded to know when I'd started smoking enough to actually want one! It took me almost an hour to get him to calm down-while Paul laughed so hard he was fucking crying.\" Ripley giggled, moving to check her phone again as Sphinx laughed; his face in his free hand as his shoulders shook. She gave him a few minutes before she pulled her hand free from his, stretching before she continued. \"So now Atley doesn't even ask about my 'sordid habits' . . . and I named the hookah Big Bart just to piss him off.\" Sphinx stilled, looking up to her in confusion as she stopped right in front of him; his eyes searching hers as he pushed to his feet to stand beside her. \"Why Bart?\" Ripley stopped, looking to him like he was crazy before she shook her head; trying not to laugh again as she realized what she'd just done. Oh Atley would kill her for this . . . if he didn't skin her for sleeping with Sphinx to begin with. Oh well, what could she do? \"Because Atley's middle name is Bartholomew. He hates it . . . and every time he's here and being overprotective or just plain out annoying I threaten to break out Bart. Works every single time.\" Sphinx laughed again, shaking his head before he moved; taking her hand in his and lifting it to where he could see the faceplate on her phone. His eyes darkened before he sighed, his mood seeming to almost sour before he could stop it. Ripley bit her lip, hesitating for half a second before she stepped into him; easing her hand free so she smooth them down his chest and around his waist. Sphinx froze every muscle in his body hardening to almost stone before he caught himself. Slowly he relaxed, one hand settling on her hips as the other came to cup her cheek. She nodded to him, giving him a cautious smile as her cheeks started to pink; her eyes searching his face as he sighed. \"I'm gonna be late if I don't get going soon, Girlie. I'm supposed to be in around 12:30 and I've still got to change.\" Ripley nodded as she glanced to their feet, her voice soft and almost shy; her fingers worrying the fabric of his shirt as she dipped her head. \"Oh. It's almost 11:30 now, Sphinx. Do you think you'll need to call and let them know you might be late? My house is about twenty minutes away from your work . . .\" He nodded, leaning forward, resting his forehead against hers as his gray green eyes bore into her blue green. His thumb caressed her cheek softly and he forced himself to smile for her, hating that this moment-this one quiet perfect moment would end as soon as he left. He knew it was stupid, that with everything they were working toward they were bound to find more opportunities like this one but he still wanted to keep it. To revel in it as long as he possibly could. Ripley's next words cemented his decision that if they ever stumbled upon another he would make sure it lasted . . . because he loved seeing her like this. So content and happy he almost couldn't bare it-and it was because of him. Of them . \"Tonight . . . after the run I'm supposed to spend some time with Char-but if you wanted you could come with us. We're going to grab a few beers, probably just come back here and relax.\" Sphinx stilled before he shrugged, nodding once as Ripley's lips split into an almost blinding smile. But as she stretched up onto her tiptoes and ghosted her lips over his her phone rang; making both of them turn to glare at it. The cell rang, vibrating across the small tabletop while the faceplate blinked sporadically; showcasing the number for the Raines home line. Sphinx glared even harder at the phone before he sighed, letting Ripley ease away to answer. Right before he groaned at what he heard. \"Hello? Penn honey what's wrong? What do you mean you don't want to stay with Tumbler? Now you were fine with him last night. Why-well no I don't have to go to work until -*SIGH* Honey that doesn't mean I'm off. I have to do other things today before I go in . . . Let me talk to your Dad.\" Ripley closed her eyes, running her hands down her face before she sighed again; pushing her fingers through her bangs as she nodded. \"Memphis? Look I have a ton of shit to today so if Junie can take her then- *SIGH* Fine, Raines. I'll come and stay with her until I have to go but I'm telling you right now I have to get this done and it's looking like today is my only shot. I'll keep her entertained until I have to leave but you need to see if Junie can take her for the rest of the day. I know you appreciate it Randal-and I don't mind. Okay . . . I'll be there in a few minutes. Yeah, you're right. You do owe me.\" She sighed, closing the phone before she turned to him; her shoulders sloped and her lips tugging down into a frown. But honestly he couldn't blame her. She had a lot to accomplish today, things that had to get done regardless of Memphis and Penn's desires. He moved, reaching out and pushing her hair out of her face; dipping to lock eyes with her. \"We'll set our plans later, Love. Just go on and deal with this. You're still going to settle shite with the house right?\" She nodded, leaning forward to rest her forehead against his; exhaling loudly as she closed her eyes. \"Yeah . . . but I have this really bad feeling that I'm going to be taking Penn. Which is fine because I love her to death . . . but Memphis is going to have to learn to tell that kid no -preferably before she's in high school.\" Sphinx nodded, deciding to keep his opinion about the matter to himself. Raines had been told that she had things to accomplish and Sphinx knew the man would hold up his end . . . or he would cart him through the morgue. He huffed, rolling his eyes as Ripley pulled away; running her hands down her face as she groaned. \"Christ, you're supposed to tell Atley today aren't you? Are you sure about this-can't we just let it wait-\" He covered her mouth with his hand, giving her pointed look as he dipped his chin to her. It wasn't what he wanted to do-and he was dreading it worse than anything he'd ever planned but he would do it. Because the sooner the others knew that they were together-that Ripley was taken and involved then the sooner they would stop doing shite like this . Meaning he would actually get to keep his lover to himself instead of having to track her down to the shop or the Raines house just to bloody see her. \"I'm sure, Girlie. And he'll be fine-\" She raised a brow at him before she pulled back enough to speak; her words flowing out quickly as she kept herself far enough out of his reach so he couldn't quiet her again. \"No he won't. He's going to flip his shit-the same way he always does over everything. And what makes it even better is Memphis seems to be in such a wonderful fucking mood-\" \"Which is their shite to sort through- not ours. I'll talk to Jackson on my way into work and by tonight everything will be settled.\" Ripley rolled her eyes, snorting before she sighed; throwing her hands up in defeat. \"Fine! Fine! But when everyone freaks out I'm not even going to bother telling you I told you so. I'll see if Char wants to go to Seal Beach with me-so we can go ahead and get that conversation over with before anyone else weighs in. Do you want me to tell Memphis when I go over or are we going to let Atley gossip?\" ","Summary":" Okay boys and girls, this one is new.

I love the direction I was going to go. So, that in mind I'm going to be revising this story. I'll be posting all of the updated chapters (and new ones) with this prologue/Intro chapter . . . but I'm telling you now. Things are going to change. It may be small things but they will change. It will still be Chaosia and Sphinx . . . it's just going to progress the way I originally wanted it to . . . before the characters got away from em and lead me to my proverbial dead end. So, without further adieu, I give you the revamped Learning Curve. Oh and Inferno? Please don't skin me for this. In the Beginning Memphis Raines couldn't believe what he was hearing. Otto had a goddaughter. And she was moving here? To work with them while she was in school? He looked at his surrogate father-figure, clearly able to see that behind the tight smile he was wearing for his practically beaming wife, Otto was just as uneasy about this as he was. Seriously what were Junie and this girl's mom thinking? They were going to send some sweet innocent kid here? Sway would probably eat her alive if she didn't snap her like a twig the first wrong word she uttered and Atley . . . Dear Lord. Atley \"Antifreeze for Blood\" Jackson was the master of the cold shoulder and gut wrenching glare. If she crossed him they'd have to ship her back to Seal Beach in a straight jacket. Donnie would be okay, as easy going as he usually was . . . and the younger crew, with the exception of Kip, would probably be neutral. Hell if she was cute, they might try to date her . . . That would just leave him to deal with keeping her out of the Sphinx's way. Memphis groaned mentally, nodding and smiling to Junie who was talking about how smart and ladylike her niece was. That cemented it. He'd have to keep Sphinx as far from her as possible. The others would respect his and Otto's wishes to be civil or just leave her alone, so long as she didn't step on toes . . . but Sphinx . . . The man lived by his own rules. And if she looked at him wrong, he'd be pushing her corpse through his morgue and right into the incinerator in the Coroner's Office. He shuddered. He'd have to go home and call Sway and Atley. He'd need their help in wrangling the others to talk and restraining the Sphinx long enough to explain he'd never have much contact with the girl . . . \"Memphis?\" He looked up to see Junie looking at him expectantly, smiling. He nodded, smiling back. No matter how much he hated this he would help Otto keep Junie happy. The woman was a saint and never asked anything of any of them . . . save to be careful. So he would do this for her. \"Sure Junie. We'll make her feel as welcome as we possibly can.\" Her smile brightened as she hugged him before she turned and gushed to Otto. \"Oh see, honey. I told you it would be fine. Besides, Chaosia isn't an idiot. Eddie's shown her about cars and she keeps up with those brothers of hers . . . well . . . mostly. She'll be nothing but a help, I can feel it.\" Otto smiled indulgently, patting Junie's hand. He never could deny her anything when she smiled. \"I know sweetness. I know. Let's just hope the others think the same thing, okay?\" She nodded, dismissing the idea immediately that anyone would dislike her cherished niece. \"Oh don't be silly, Otto. Chaosia is a doll. Kip and Tumbler will love her. Sway may have to get used to another girl being around but I think even she will be happy for the company . . . Why I bet even that quiet young man Sphinx will take a shine to her once she's here. She's impossible to ignore once you get to know her.\" Memphis paled but nodded, laughing weakly. \"I'm sure you're right Junie. Now, I'm gonna go and tell the others. When does she get here?\" Junie beamed, grabbing Otto's hand and squeezing it. \"Tomorrow afternoon. She'll be here tomorrow afternoon to talk with Otto and survey the front office. Millennia and I are putting her to work reorganizing it and the Records Room for the month she won't be in school. Give her something to do other than fix up that house. Maybe if the office looks nice enough the customers can overlook our more sour restorers like Bob and Mitchell.\" Memphis huffed. \"Unlikely, Junie. You'd have to be blind and deaf to overlook Bob and Mitchell.\" She chuckled, soothing Otto as he groused. \"I know they're uptight but they're the best at what they do, Memphis my boy. Until I can replace them I have to have them. Even if Sway does want to break their jaws.\" Memphis nodded, bidding the couple goodbye before heading out to Eleanor. He had phone calls to make and prayers to say. He just hoped that this would all work out for the best . . . Chaosia stood in the doorway of her now empty apartment, looking over the vast space with remorse. She didn't want to leave home . . . and that's what this place had been since she'd turned nineteen and moved out of her parents' house for freedom. Sure she still loved them and had been a frequent visitor at their home . . . but she had needed the space to grow away from them. And she doubted her father would have let her then boyfriend live if they'd fucked in house. She sighed, glowering at the blank walls. Marcello was the whole reason she was having to move in the first place, the lying bastard. Before he'd decided to up and start whoring around she was going to be able to just commute the twenty minutes to school and back. But oh no. He just had to screw around. And with Bastian's girlfriend no less. She growled, cutting the lights and closing the door. She knew she should blame her brothers for this too but for some reason she just couldn't bring herself to be angry with either of the dorks. Especially Bastian. He was a yuppie and usually acted like he was better than everyone else . . . but he was her yuppie. And she knew that no matter how big and bad he was acting right now, her yuppie was hurting. He and Yvonne had been together for almost three years . . . and had been planning the wedding of the century . . . And then this happened. She sighed, walking down the hallway to the elevator as slowly as she could. She would be staying with Bastian tonight and leaving for Long Beach in the morning. She really didn't mind going there . . . she just didn't want to go there like this. She felt like she was abandoning her brothers and that didn't sit well with her. Hell, she'd gone out one night with Paul to drown her sorrows and had woken up to the whole Children's Pool fiasco. She grinned. She really didn't put them up to it but it was a work of art in the revenge department . . . she had never really cared for Monique but she had to give Mikhail's girlfriend credit. She was a pro at getting even. As she rode the lift down, she couldn't help but feel the weight of everything falling on her. She and Marcello hadn't been like Bastian and Yvonne but they had been together . . . and Marcello was supposed to be the best man in Bastian's damned wedding. A wedding that would never happen now that said best man had fucked the bride-to-be for the past four months. She sighed. It was probably better this way. She could go to Long Beach and open up the house in Bixby Knolls. She could redecorate that and help Uncle Otto and Aunt Junie with the shop paperwork. And whatever else they needed. She could make a new life for herself without Marcello constantly telling her that studying to be a Marine Biologist was stupid. Everything would work out for the best . . . Now if she only believed that.[Chapter 2] Some new things here but not many . . . Learning Curve Otto Halliwell wasn't an easy man to surprise . . . but when the new \"secretary\" walked into his shop's office he was very surprised in deed. He was also aware that he was in for a world of hurt and trouble. He knew that when he'd gotten the random and out-of-the-blue phone call from his wife's cousin he was in for it. Especially since said extended relation was also married to a business friend of his from Seal Beach that seemed to have an uncanny knack for causing trouble wherever he went. Hell, Eddie Guadimus had introduced him to Junie when he and his now wife Millennia were dating. And that (along with his wife's fondness for both the idiotic older boost and his wife) was the only reason he'd even considered agreeing to the idea of letting Guadimus's daughter work for him while she was in school. Junie had helped force the issue when she'd found out that Chaosia Ripley, who was named for Millennia and Junie's grandmother the poor kid, was actually enrolling at California State University's Long Beach chapter for her graduate degree in Natural Sciences and Ocean Studies. She was going to be interning with the Aquarium of the Pacific later in her term but she needed a job to help pay her bills and buy books. So Junie had mentioned that he was desperately behind in his legal paperwork and hated the computer she'd forced him to get for the office. The gossiping women had already planned out just how much he was going to pay his goddaughter and when she would work when he and Eddie had been informed. Eddie had been okay with the fact that his only daughter was going to work in the legal portion of his shop, so long as that's where she stayed. She apparently knew what her father had done before he decided to run a legal garage and detailing business . . . and hadn't expressed much interest other than learning the basics. Or at least that's what her mother swore to Junie. But as Otto looked at the woman his goddaughter had transformed into, loitering in the doorway as unsure of what came next as he was, he was beginning to believe it. Nothing as sweet and innocent as she looked could want anything to do with the world he and Memphis's crew were trying so hard to break from. Her hair was the color of her father's, a deep golden blonde with platinum and strawberry blonde streaks littering her waist length curls. Her bangs were swept over her forehead from the right, partially shielding one of her pale sea glass blue-green eyes. She was tanned from her days in the sun with light freckles splaying across her nose and cheeks. Pouty pink lips spread into a friendly-but-bashful smile showing perfect white teeth. What killed him though was how she was dressed. Her distressed faded jeans hung loose on her hips while fitting a little too well on her butt and legs then tapering out and into a slight flare. The retro styled light blue top with the tiny flower print was innocent enough with its cap sleeves and squared neckline with the small lapels . . . until you saw that it was very low cut and paired over a very lacey white camisole that framed her chest a little too nicely but still managed to look conservative. She was wearing a long gold necklace with a glossy iridescent blue-green koi fish charm that was designed to move with its wearer along with simple iridescent blue-green tear drop earrings and a matching gold, diamond and aquamarine koi cocktail ring making it easy to see the influence of her major. The pale blue moccasins with white stitching finished off her odd but cute look. Otto laid his head on his desk, suddenly regretting getting roped into this. He lifted back up to see her looking down at him worriedly, her bottom lip pulled in between her teeth. \"Um . . . Are you okay, Uncle Otto? You look a little flushed . . . I mean if I need to come back later I can there's not a problem there at all. I still have to open up Mom and Dad's house down in Bixby Knolls and well . . .\" Otto nodded, getting up and going around the desk, putting on his best grin for the girl. \"Seems you still ramble when you're nervous, eh girl?\" She laughed, cheeks flushing brightly as she nodded and hugged him. \"Yeah, Uncle Otto. I do. Mom hates it but Dad still thinks it's cute. So . . . what exactly do those two gossiping hens have me set up to do every day of the week when I'm not at class or working with the aquarium? Mom was so eager to get me here that she practically had my apartment packed and shipped to the house two seconds after I agreed . . . \" \"Couldn't be bothered with the details, huh?\" She shook her head, still smiling at him. He chuckled, pulling her into the office and a one armed hug, showing her to his filing cabinets and the damned computer in the smaller room off the office. \"Well kiddo, you're in for a world of hurt. Especially since I doubt that damn computer's been on more than twice. Even with Toby here.\" She groaned but nodded, eyeing the towering piles of boxes and papers like they were going to topple at any minute and kill her. She stepped into the 'records room', which was a glorified cubby hole with shelves and a very dusty window that was packed to the gills with enough paperwork for twenty years. She looked at her godfather, shaking her head as she stepped in and started flipping through an open box. Suddenly, the cardboard box tipped and the whole leaning tower of papers, files invoices and mismatched car parts came spilling around her feet. She looked at the mess then to her now gaping 'uncle'. \"Okay. Uncle Otto, you so owe me for this. Let me get a list together and try and clear up this mess.\" Otto nodded, turning to leave when he heard her squawk again. He turned just in time to see another tower crumble and send a wave of paper towards them. He looked, trying to find Chaosia as he heard rustling under the piles. When she sat up, papers sticking out of her curls and dust settling around her, he started chuckling. Her expression went from outright shocked to royally pissed so quickly and completely that he couldn't help but laugh. She was still graceful . He scuttled from the room just in time to avoid the decrepit accordion folder that was hurled at his head, laughing loudly the whole way. Maybe having Chaos around here wouldn't be so bad after all. Chaosia Ripley Guadimus had never been one to willingly surrender and accept defeat. She'd mastered three forms of martial arts when she was younger just to prove she could do what her brothers could do and better. She'd graduated top of her class nearly three years early from high school just so she could walk down that stage with her elder brother Mikhail (despite the immense hatred the principal had for both of them). She'd fought to earn her scuba license and deep sea diving credentials. She'd gone through hell to earn her certification in underwater caving in spite of her almost paralyzing claustrophobia . . . And she would be damned if a bunch of papers and parts spilling out of a glorified coat closet were going to bring her to her knees. She'd survived worse. And it was with that mentality that she pushed forward and sorted through the almost seventeen years of back paperwork and invoices her adoring 'Uncle' had shoved in this damned cubby of hell to forget about. She sighed, blowing a wayward strand of her bangs up and out of her face for the seventh time in fifteen minutes. She'd quickly shed her cute top and cami when she'd actually gotten into the back of the closet, going and retrieving a black tee and faded grey Bermuda shorts from her sea foam green Cayenne Turbo S that she kept for when she went surfing. It was the only option for saving her outfit after spotting the thick layer of dust that had accumulated over the room's long term abandonment. So the fact that she was sitting in the floor, barefoot with her hair pulled up atop her head with one of her many black elastic headbands holding her hair at bay wasn't really that big of a deal. No, the big deal was the huge dusty bunny she'd just found lodged in one of the millions of accordion files. She was positive that the damn thing just moved on its own. She sighed, trying to look away from the damn thing and go back to her sorting. She'd made a rather nice sized dent and wanted to at least get everything organized and into the proper piles before she went to head home. If the papers were all sorted together than the new filing cabinets she was picking up tomorrow morning to go along the longest wall would actually be more useful. Plus she would be able to get the restaurant shelving in here and add the bins so she could start cataloguing and storing miscellaneous parts and pieces the restores might need. She ran the heel of her hand over her eyes, trying to force herself to focus. Tomorrow would be a bust if she didn't get this done. Thank God she'd come to Long Beach a whole month earlier than she needed to . . . or she would be strapped to get her house in order and do all of this. A noise from the main portion of the garage caught her attention. She stopped sorting, listening to the new and rowdy voices that seemed to be heading in her direction. \"Man, I can't believe Otto just handed this chick a job! He wouldn't even let Wayland come on full time and he just up and gives this mystery girl a nice position as a secretary? What's she going to file? Her nails? This is a garage not a damn office!\" Chaos stopped, forcing herself to not overreact to whoever was out there. She knew that Otto's current crew wouldn't take kindly to the idea of a newcomer, and a girl none the less, invading their midst. Her mother and father had said that all of Otto's workers had been here when the shop had been more than a garage and restoration depot so they were all going to be hard to win over. She wouldn't automatically be accepted like she was with her Dad's crew. A newer, lighter voice brought her attention back to the discussion outside. \"Yeah Bob I have no idea what she's going to do but its Otto's place and it's his decision. And just to let you know Sway didn't want to come here full time. She likes working at the Anchor and here. So don't automatically dislike the girl for that. Besides I thought you couldn't stand Sway anyway.\" She heard the deeper voice grunt and respond, nonplussed by the logic his companion had presented. \"I don't, Raines. She's too damn bossy and emotional for my tastes. Plus if she's here your brother is as useless as a second asshole and you know it. But at least she knows her way around a car. I saw the scrawny little thing that'll be hanging around here from now on.\" \" So?\" Another snort. \"So she doesn't look like she's ever pumped her own damn gas much less done anything under the hood of a car. And the way she and Otto were hanging all over each other . . . mark my words she'll be the new Mrs. Halliwell soon enough.\" Chaosia couldn't help it. She saw red. How dare whoever this jerk was suggest that she would even think of doing something so horrible? And to her own Aunt with her Uncle ? This idiot was going to bleed. Profusely. She stood, dusting the dirt and paper debris from her shorts and went to leave the Records Room. She was walking out when she spotted the conversationalists. There was a group of five men standing near one of the paint docks, obviously deep in discussion. The loudest was also the oldest, apparently by at least fifteen years. He was also her critic. She reached up and shook her hair free of the bun and headband. If she was going to kill someone might as well let her hair down to do it. She crossed the garage, eyes locked on the grease covered moron who was still arguing with one of the younger men who had his hair slicked back severely. This one was defending Otto while the other three nodded, none of the five spotting her until she was almost on top of them. She cleared her throat, tapping the biggest idiot on the shoulder. When he turned and saw her, she registered the disgust annoyance and (grossly) lust that passed through his dark green eyes before he opened his mouth and sealed his fate. \"Sorry sweetheart but your boss is gone on back to his current missus so you'd best go on and do some filing before you get your pretty little hands dirty.\" Later, when Otto was yelling at her she would swear that she didn't remember what he said to make her go off because she knew restorers of the skill level her Uncle employed were rare. Especially these days with technology and machines replacing the human aspects of detailing and manufacturing . . . but she knew what had set her off. She'd just never tell. Besides, she'd gotten in her licks. Chaos was barely aware of anything other than her fist slamming into the man's left jowl and the follow through to the right. She distantly registered the shocked cries and curses of her observers as she then locked her hands together and brought them down on the top of the man, Bob's head with as much force as she could without doing serious and permanent injury. When he fell into a crumpled pile at her feet, she realized that the man with the gelled hair had been yelling at her as he met the ground. His friend, a guy with spiked blonde hair and the build of a boxer came around and grabbed her around the middle, pulling her away as Bob tried to stagger to his feet, words slurring as he swayed dangerously. When he took a sloppy swing in her and Blondie's direction she popped him the face with three quick and vicious jabs, nodding as she heard bone crunch. Her brothers would be proud of those hits when she told them about this little fiasco. She could practically hear Mikhail crowing with pride in the back of her head as the Gel Boy screamed, \"Jesus Tumbler get her out of here before she kills him! He's too stupid to stay down!\" Her handler, Tumbler, pulled her out of the garage and back towards the office and Records Room and out the front door. When they were beside her Cayenne, he asked her,\"Can I let you lose without you hitting me?\" She stopped and shrugged before nodding. He set her down and let go, taking a few quick steps back uncertainly. Chaos turned, eyeing him with open amusement and amazement. He was in a loose and informal boxing stance but she recognized one when she saw it. His feet were spread just enough to give him a firm but fluid base should he have to defend against a punch. Smart boy. She smirked. Like she'd be stupid enough to hit him . He was at least 5'10 maybe taller, giving him a good four inches and a hundred pounds on her. She'd have to incapacitate him within three hits to even stand a chance. She could do it . . . but she really didn't want to explain to her Uncle why she'd hit two of his workers. Or tell her mother that she'd broken her knuckles bare knuckle boxing. Again. Finally, he spoke. \"Jeez. Did you hit him hard enough? I heard bone crunch on that second set.\" Chaos shrugged, flipping her hair over her shoulders. \"He should've kept his mouth shut. Or, at the very least, kept his voice down if he didn't know anyone else was around. I was in the Hell Hole when he started up with that mess.\" Tumbler's lips quirked but he tried to remain serious. \"The Hell Hole ?\" Chaos nodded, turning to examine the three cars pulling around to the back. These had to be Otto's other people. The ones who ran the boosts before and were trying to go straight. If anything, their cars gave them away the same way her Dad's did him. The sleek black 72 Jaguar E Type Convertible, the gunmetal grey 67 Shelby Mustang GT500 with black Le Mons stripes and the gleaming blue 69 Chevelle Malibu all screamed people who loved cars as much as her Dad's ultra-rare and coveted red 1937 Bugatti Atlante. Not liked or appreciated. Loved . She turned back to Tumbler, taking him in. He was cute in a weird way. His blonde hair stuck up at all angles and his blue eyes had this mischievous glint to them, like he was always in on a joke no one else got. He was built like the fighter he apparently was and dressed like . . . well. His black garage shirt and baggy blue jeans looked okay but Chaos had the feeling that this was normal for him. The long silver chain hanging from his pocket made her think of Mikhail. They would probably get along great. \"Yeah, you know. The unused Records Room that's been making my life hell for the past,\" she looked at her watch, actually groaning when she realized the time. \"Six hours and counting. I swear Uncle Otto is doing this on purpose.\" Tumbler nodded before jumping to attention. \"Uncle Otto?\" She nodded, sitting on the hood of her car while eyeing the five people coming out the front door of the garage. This was going to get interesting. One looked like Gel Boy (who was walking beside him and talking quickly and quietly) but older in slacks and a shirt with a light jacket over it. His brown hair was styled almost conservatively and he had this easy going gait to him. His eyes, however, put her on edge. There was something sharp about those blue eyes as he took her in on the hood of her Cayenne. The next person was maybe only a few years the other's senior and was walking with an apparent but down played limp. He had on mostly dark colors and his hair was slicked back almost as severely as Gel Boy's. He had stubble on his face and looked very amused at the situation. Chaos decided immediately that she liked this guy. He just seemed in control and chilled at the same time. No pressure or pretenses. She turned, noticing the woman among them. She was, for lack of a better word, gorgeous. If not a tad untraditional. Her hair was bleached platinum blonde and fell in streaks, almost dreads around her neck and shoulders, the bangs being pinned out of her face. Her green eyes were rimmed in dark liner and her very plump and pouty lips were bare. And spread into a very dark and almost contagious smirk. She was dressed in leather red pants and a dark tank top, her heavy black boots clunking as she made her way across the gravel. The last guy made her sit up a little straighter. He was huge . Not fat or pudgy (unlike poor Bob inside who seemed to have eight chins and two butts) but solid and built. He was at least 6'2 and dressed in dark jeans (cuffed once at the ankle oddly) and a black tee shirt. Topped off with black shoes and suspenders. Honest to God suspenders. She smirked, doubting anyone ever came up and popped the straps like she and her brother did to their least favorite uncle at formal occasions. From the severe look of him they might lose an arm. As the entourage came to stand in front of her, the first one (and apparently the leader) stepped forward and extended his hand. An easy smile was on his face but she could tell he was nervous. Huh. That's a new one . \"I'm Memphis Raines.\" Chaosia looked at his outstretched hand a breath longer than she should have before taking it and shaking once. \"Chaos Guadimus, nice to meet you Memphis.\" He nodded, suddenly seeming more at ease after hearing her name. \"You're Otto's goddaughter, right? The one moving here from Seal Beach for school or something.\" She nodded, resituating herself on the hood of her car and crossing her arms. \"Yeah. You guys all work for him?\" Memphis glared as the guy with the limp chuckled. \"Something like that, sweetheart. We're actually more of friends and freeloaders than employees. I'm Atley Jackson. Hell of a job you did in there.\" She smiled, nodding. She was right. She did like Atley. He seemed to be as big of a smart ass as her. Oh the possibilities. \"Yeah well he'll think twice before sprouting out his bullshit to anyone who'll listen again. I should've broken his damn jaw for saying half of that crap. I mean seriously .\" The woman smiled, turning to Memphis and Gel Boy. \"See? I told you Bob was a prick but oh no. I was just being a drama queen.\" Chaos snorted, flipping her hair over her shoulder as she turned to face the woman directly. She was glad that she hadn't been the only one to want to gut the slob she'd left broken on the shop floor. \"I'm sure you weren't. You should have heard the shit spilling out of his mouth. I mean if you don't have anything intelligent to say then don't freaking speak at all, ya know?\" She laughed, stepping up and extending her hand. \" Exactly. I'm Sway.\" Chaos shook her hand, smirking. The big guy in the back just kept looking at her, as if trying to gauge something. Finally, Atley stepped forward and introduced him. \"That's the Sphinx but don't be offended. He doesn't talk much.\" She quirked a brow before shrugging and turning to Memphis. \"Oh well. To each his own. So, are you going to tell me his name or am I going to have to dub him Gel Boy?\" Memphis laughed as the boy in question squawked indignantly. \"This is my brother Kip. And please, only call him Gel Boy when I'm around to hear it. C'mon. The others have gotten Bob out so you can come back in. We'll start the introductions.\" She nodded, laughing as she slid off the hood of her Cayenne. At least she had a feeling they would help with Otto tomorrow when he found out she'd assaulted one of his employees. Hopefully.[Chapter 3] Okay, yes I know. This is going to be bothersome. This chapter has been revised and editted so start from the beginning and enjoy! I'm expanding this one to make it feel more like what my original notes and outlines were leading me to . . . so yeah. Inferno don't kill me. Revenge of the Smurf Mirror Man was quite possibly the oddest person Chaosia had ever had the misfortune of meeting. But damn if he wasn't funny. Said boost kept sliding closer and closer to the spot the older crew runners had claimed. Oh sure, he joked and rough housed with Kip and Tumbler as he stalked his prey . . . but Chaos was sure that was just excess energy and habit more than trying to not be discovered. The others were oblivious, obviously practiced at drowning the younger crew out . . . A useful tidbit to log away. Apparently, if she was seeing this right, Mirror was the one to keep Kip and Tumbler on their toes . . . and the prankster of the bunch . . . but why on earth did he keep getting closer to the \"Old School\"? She shrugged to herself, rolling her eyes as Tumbler tossed Kip around and flipped her bangs out of her eyes. Lord she hated her hair some days . . . she was really beginning to rethink that haircut. Leaning forward, she tapped Toby on the shoulder. The boy, to his credit, was only momentarily dazed by her presence before shaking himself and smiling sheepishly . They were going to have to get used to her being around before the looks like that would stop . . . \"Uh, yeah Chaosia?\" She smirked at him, waiting until he was clear headed enough to answer her. He turned completely from his laptop, giving her his full attention and a cute little blush from being so shy. \"So . . . What's Flava Flav up to?\" Toby paled as Freb stuttered, both turning to see Mirror sneaking glances at the stoic man leaning against the back wall of the shop. Freb practically squeaked but forced out, \"No-nothing . . . what would give you that idea?\" Chaos crossed her arms, brow raised as she gave both of them a bored look. \"Gee. Let me think. The sheer tension the four of you are broadcasting or the fact that he's circling your other friends,\" she nodded her head towards the Old School, \" like a shark that's smelled blood. Take your pick.\" Tumbler and Kip joined them, the former leaning against her perch on the abandoned work bench as he smirked down at her. Kip gave her an appraising look before quietly explaining. \"Memphis and the others cut us out of some fun a few weeks ago . . .We were all pretty pissed but Mirror took it really badly.\" She looked past Kip, head cocked slightly to the side as she watched Mirror. He seemed to be part of this faction so why would an action by theirs cause such a ruckus? \"Why?\" Kip shrugged, leaning on the other side of her. \"For whatever reason. Mirror isn't exactly the easiest person to figure out. Or control.\" Chaos tried not to laugh from her perch as she watched the brightly dressed man continue to sneak glances at the towering man leaning against the back wall glaring behind his \"signature shades\". Tumbler smirked beside her, leaning and chuckling. \"So tonight's all about the payback.\" Now, Chaosia was never an advocate of violence or cruelty (despite her predisposition to both when she'd been pushed too far) but she was sure that whatever was going to follow this eccentric little man's actions was going to be epic . And hilarious since she (hopefully) wouldn't be on the receiving end. Said eccentric little boost was still glancing to the man on the back wall and the other older members of their crew, hands tucked in the pockets of his light baggy jeans. His bright yellow tee shirt and bright blue track jacket over it were enough to make Chaosia's eyes hurt . . . but the others seemed almost desensitized to it. Apparently this was how the man always dressed. His looked towards her, ever present shades glinting as he tilted his head and smirked. Toby and Freb shared a look of panic. This was apparently the signal. She smirked, looking from Mirror to the panicking computer whiz. Toby was short, only two inches taller than her, and tanned. His dirty blond hair was spiked and messy and his pale blue eyes radiated innocence and happiness almost constantly. Unless Mirror was speaking then they showed panic and annoyance. His jeans and tee shirt were typical Cali casual. But the ever present Alien Ware Laptop was not. She knew how expensive those bad boys were . . . and usually only hackers went to that extreme because they need the power and Ram. She logged another tidbit away, looking to Freb. The boy had a darker almost olive complexion and longer black hair styled in an odd but cool way. His basic jeans and white tee shirt under the dark jacket reminded Chaos of a fifties greaser. But when he spoke it was pure modern Cali. She smirked. He sounded like a surfer. A clueless surfer but a surfer none the less. The other younger members apparently shared the clueless thought because they seemed to watch him almost constantly. He'd already tripped over the huge dog Otto insisted on keeping around once. She smiled, looking down at the slumbering drool machine at his feet. The dog apparently loved Freb to death, following his every step since he'd come in and getting under his feet to snooze the second they stopped moving. She turned her attention to Tumbler and Kip, who looked torn between being pleased and worried about whatever was going to transpire. Kip Raines looked at her, shrugging before he and Tumbler shared a look. Tumbler chuckled, taking a long swig of the beer he'd found in the garage's fridge before leaning in to tell her, \"Mirror is probably going to die for this but it'll be worth it. Besides, he lives to do this shit.\" Kip snorted, nodding. \"You mean he lives to try and get us killed. I swear this is going to be bad . Sphinx is going to skin us alive dude. Mark my words.\" Chaos turned, looking to Kip. He was a few inches shorter than Tumbler and had a slight wiry build. His dark brown hair was slicked back harshly while his hazel eyes seemed to watch everything around him. He seemed to be slightly impulsive but as she watched Memphis glance over to check on his brother for the second time in the last few minutes she wondered how much of it was really his nature and how much was adopted to conform to his brother's wishes. She knew from personal experience with Bastian and Mikhail that an elder protective sibling couldn't always handle the knowledge that while they were wanted they weren't really needed as desperately as they liked to believe. This is why whenever she saw either of them she made sure to need their advice . . . or guidance or protection or whatever else to keep their egos afloat and her father off her back. Mirror's movement caught her attention, drawing her eyes towards him. He was now standing towards the office door and had . . . was that a damn fire hose he was holding? The older crew members were still oblivious as Toby and Freb quickly and discretely moved around her and the other two. Toby was frantically putting his laptop up and under the work bench she was sitting on, closing the doors and standing in front of it. Freb stood beside him, helping act as a human barrier for whatever onslaught was about to happen. Tumbler drained his beer and looked to Kip. \"So, you think he really won't hit us with that crap? I mean he got that dye from one of his hair styling buddies. It's semi-permanent and I really don't want to be blue for a few days.\" Kip shrugged, looking back at Chaos as she caught sight of the canister Mirror was screwing on the end of the hose. It was filled with a bright blue liquid that was sloshing and mixing with the water ebbing from the hosepipe. How on earth had no one heard him get the hose or turn on the water? \"No idea but I hope you're not wearing anything you're too attached to.\" She sighed, thankful she'd changed and left her good shoes in the car as she shook her head. \"No I changed when I was attacked by the dust bunnies from hell. So, when are we getting soaked?\" Kip opened his mouth to speak only to be cut off by Sway's shriek and Memphis's squawking (she could so tell who Kip took after). Chaos turned, watching Mirror laugh maniacally as he soaked the Old School. Donnie Astricky and Atley were both shouting at him to stop as he blasted them while Sway kept looking down at her now blue tresses and the splotches of blue water running down her skin and clothes. Memphis looked like a blue berry. His face hair and skin all a very bright cyan hue as he tried to get up off the floor where he'd fallen under the water pressure. Kip and Tumbler had given up on not laughing and were rolling in the floor, tears streaming down their faces. Toby and Freb were still in front of the workstation (and her thankfully) as Mirror sprayed them with the water, laughing even harder as they both squeaked. Chaos's breath caught in her throat however when Mirror turned his attention to the glowering man on the back wall. Apparently, all of the glances had asserted what she'd heard Toby muttering about earlier. Mirror really did have a love of aggravating the silent boost brooding away in the shadows . . . Oh there was going to be hell to pay. Sphinx had been minding his own damn business, going through the items he'd need to recalibrate his intake for the Malibu when he'd noticed the younger ones start going toward Otto's goddaughter. He'd snorted mentally before deciding to keep an eye on them for a moment. They were a good lot and the girl could definitely take care of herself if the bleeding idiot from earlier was anything to judge by. But he respected Otto and knew he wouldn't want them to start corrupting the scrawny girl immediately after meeting her. He watched her eye the others critically, the same way she had outside. He knew that look. She was watching and cataloging everything she could in their relatively unguarded moments. She was weighing them against whatever prior knowledge she had (and knowing Otto it wasn't much) to see who to trust and who to be weary of. He hated to admit it but he was impressed. He rarely came across anyone who observed as much as he did and it was almost eerie to see that little thing does it. And she was good at hiding that she was doing it, too. He doubted the others even knew they were being watched as closely as they were. He'd have to keep an eye on this one. She could cause trouble if she found out that they still ran as a crew and her dear Uncle was one of their numbers. Sphinx watched as she rolled her eyes at Tumbler and Kip, flipping her hair over her shoulder before looking back at the others. Her hair was down and falling in gold and platinum curls to her back, partially covering one of her light odd eyes. The tee shirt she was wearing was loose but showed off the fact that no matter how scrawny he thought her, the reality was anything but. She had muscle in her arms and back as well as her torso. The grey shorts showed off long tanned and muscled legs while her bare feet kept drawing his attention. He found it odd that she'd been walking around barefoot since they'd arrived and acted like it was nothing. She apparently spent enough time doing so that she could stand the gravel and pavement. Sphinx sighed, closing his eyes and leaning his head back. He would admit she was a pretty little thing. But there was something else about her that just made his hackles rise. He opened his eyes, looking back at her in time to see her glancing away from him, a blush on her face. He would definitely have to keep an eye on her until he figured out how she was working her way under his skin. Maybe it was the fact that he'd been dying to slaughter the blighter she'd knocked earlier but hadn't for respect of Otto and Memphis. Besides, it wasn't like the man hadn't had it coming. Especially with how he'd heard him speak to Sway the few times he'd seen him. It's why when he was present the normally tough as nails boost had started to stay closer to his wall than to Memphis. The man was nonplussed by either Raines brother but he held a healthy fear of Sphinx. Sphinx smirked. As well he should. He would've done more than break his bloody jaw. Sphinx was so caught in thought that he barely had time to register Mirror's sneak attack before he was drenched in bright blue water. He looked down at his pants and shirt, knowing almost immediately that his favorite jacket was soaked through and most probably ruined if Memphis's clothes were anything to go by. A gasp brought his eyes up to look with the girl's. She looked at him in a mix of mortification and awe, like she knew what was going to happen and was able to react now that he'd been hit. He grimaced, shedding the sopping coat and tee shirt. There would be blood for this shite. He ran a hand over his face, looking at the blue tint his palm was taking on even after he shook the water free. Oh that boy was dead. He looked back up, now even more pissed at the look Otto's goddaughter was giving him. He closed his eyes and started to try and count to ten in his head, pretending to not be affected by the way her eyes had been tracing every scar and imperfection on his chest and torso. He didn't want to look up again and see anything in her or anyone else's eyes but terror and fear. Not the compassion or wonder he'd seen flitting behind the sea glass irises. And not the awe Sway was currently looking at him in. He turned, hearing another gasp and ignoring it. He knew his back was just as scarred and with the tattoos he looked fearsome. Which suited him just fine . But something about the way that girl reacted caused his gut to clench. Of course a sheltered little thing like her would've never seen anyone as scarred as him or the other boosts. Hell, even Sway sported her fair share of trophies and battle scars. It came with the turf. He looked eyes with the now terrified Mirror and growled. The boy, thinking fast, turned the hose to full blast and sprayed him down again before dropping it and running as fast as he could through the office and out the front door. The starting of a car told all of them that even though Sphinx had been hot on his heels he hadn't caught him quick enough. When he came back in, blue droplet of water running down his neck and chest, he glared at the still cackling and just as soaked Kip and Tumbler. At least Toby and Freb seemed upset as they shook water from their own clothes. The girl however was missing. Oh great, they'd scared her off . Otto was going to hang the lot of them. Atley was handing Sphinx his soaked clothes, grimacing as his shoes squished when he walked causing Tumbler to fall laughing again as the dust settled from Mirror's revenge tactics. Kip was busy trying to help Memphis ring the blue out his own shirt but still chuckling even as he brother cuffed his ear. \"Seriously Kip! That was insane . You'd better tell him to watch out or he's grass.\" Sway nodded, accepting a clean shop towel from Chaos as she started handing them out. She'd run to the supply closet and grabbed the rags, soap and bucket to star cleaning up the mess . . . returning just in time to drool over the very drenched and shirtless Sphinx. She sighed, looking down at her own partially blue clothes with a grimace. She was (thankfully) mostly dry in comparison to the others, only her tee shirt and hair had gotten wet since she'd ducked behind Toy and Freb. She glanced over at the others, trying not to giggle. It could've been worse . . . . Donnie was chuckling, seeing how this could've been funny but quickly stopped at the glare he got from the Sphinx. The stoic man left the main garage and headed towards the bathroom before Chaos could hand him a towel. Sway and Memphis quickly left the former declaring she was going \"home to wash this shit off before she was blue permanently\". Atley and Donnie quickly followed suit, Donnie shedding his shirt as he left the garage. \"Damn clothes are going to ruin my seats, Atley. I may kill that smurf for this yet .\" Atley agreed, shedding his own coat mournfully as he got in the passenger side of the gleaming Jaguar. \"I may just help you, Donnie.\" Soon, Kip and Tumbler were rounding up Toby and Freb, declaring that they needed to try and catch Mirror before he hopped the border before piling into Kip's Hum Vee and Tumbler's Nova. Which left Chaos with another huge mess to clean up before she could leave. Well fan- fucking -tastic! Hello lovelies! Read the author's note at the beginning and all will be explained. Later![Chapter 4] So much fun . . . so little time . . . I own nothing . . . The Aftermath Chaos grumbled as she surveyed the garage, assessing the damage and clean up time with a snarl. Mirror had been her life less than twenty four hours and he was already causing her heartache. She grimaced, grabbing the bucket and using a portion of the towels to sop up the puddles of blue water Mirror had left in his wake. She tossed the drenched towels into the bucket, pulling her hair back up into a messy bun as she stood to get more. Of course he couldn't just use normal water. He had to use something to stain the damn floor if it wasn't cleaned up almost immediately. She sighed, heading to through the now deserted garage for more towels. At least no one was here to see her on bended knees scrubbing up blueberry bubbles . . . She was almost to the utility/storage closet when she ran into something hard and warm, slipping on the remaining water on the floor and landing flat on her ass. \" OW! Son of a bitch that hurt .\" She looked up to see Sphinx looking down at her like she was crazy. She knew she was blushing and damn it she didn't care. She'd just fallen flat on her ass into a puddle of blue water. She was allowed to curse and be upset. The stoic man continued to stare at her for what seemed like an eternity before letting out a long suffering sigh and extending his hand to her; pulling her to her feet in one smooth motion. She nodded, still blushing. \"Thanks. Sorry about running into you.\" He shrugged his eyebrows before going around her to the main garage to (apparently) look for the others. When she came back, he was holding his still soaked shirt out and looking at it disdainfully as the water dripped from the still sopping material. His suspenders were still attached to his jeans and hanging on either side of his waist. Chaos turned, going back to trying to get the water up as she realized why he wore them as his pants sagged just enough to see the deep V of his pelvic bones and the top of his underpants. She chastised herself as she forced her eyes to the blue puddles and away from the toned chest and abs and pelvic dips. Good lord she had to call Mia and Paul when she ever got home. They would love this. She'd been here less than a day and she'd already found a few wonderful pieces of eye candy. Though she doubted Mia would agree about the glowering man before her she knew Paul would love it. She threw another soaked rag in the bucket, grabbing a new one from the pile and starting on another puddle which let her see the huge black sphinx tattoo that wrapped under his left shoulder down his side. It was an amazing tattoo, like most of the ones that littered his body. She traced the lines with her eyes for a second before they traveled to the scars beside it. Instead of detracting from the view (and what a view it was) they actually added to it. Made him seem more real than anyone else with that build and his attitude would. He apparently felt her eyes and turned quirking a brow at her. She blushed but covered her staring as quickly as she could by tossing the barely used rag in the bucket with its fallen brethren. Finally the silence was just too much. \"They all left, the other members of your crew I mean. I actually thought I was the only one here until I ran into you.\" She sighed, glancing down at her watch. It was two o'clock in the morning. Great . \"Remind me to castrate your friend for this shit. I haven't even known him a day and he's already knocking me out of sleep. Is it really not bad enough that I've already gone a bare knuckle round with the other idiot? Now I have to duck highly pressurized blue water. We all look like we've been swimming in a toilet somewhere.\" She looked up and groaned to herself at the look he was giving her. Oh great. She thought he was hot and he thinks she's crazy. Awesome. Sphinx knew both of his brows were substantially closer to his hair line as he looked down at her but he couldn't help it. He hadn't really given any thought to what they'd looked like after the Smurf Attack but as he looked down at the blue on his skin he had to chuckle. She had a point. They really did look like they'd taken a dive in a urinal . . . He looked back up at her in time to see her glancing at him from the corner of her eye. He quirked a brow; letting her know she'd been caught. Chaos groaned, burying her face in her hands as though to shield herself from the bright blush overtaking her skin. Not that it helped. Huh. Apparently Otto didn't know just how much of a handful the girl actually was . . . judging by the muffled curse spilling from beneath her hands. None of them would've ever expected her to sound like this. Actually, they hadn't known what to expect at all. All he and Atley had heard from Otto (via Memphis the closet gossip queen of course) was how cute and lady like the girl had been when she was younger, a tom boy streak showing every now and again. But as he took in her own blue spotted apparel and the casual liquid way she moved, he had to guess that some of the little lady had faded away to whoever this was before him. All he knew as he watched her stand and go to start cutting lights, grumbling and gathering things as she went, was that she was definitely going to change some things around the shop and the crew. She came back, holding the canvas duffel and a set of keys to the Porsche outside with her shoes in hand. She stopped in front of him, shifting the duffel and shoes to extend her now free hand to him. \"I'm Chaosia by the way. I mean . . . I know I told Memphis but it just seems rude to not introduce myself when it's just us, ya know?\" He shrugged. What the hell . He took her much smaller hand in his and shook once, noticing that despite the fact that she was tiny she had a surprisingly strong grip and callouses along the palms from some sort of work. Huh. That was interesting . She smiled bashfully, shrugging as she said, \"Well, it was interesting to meet you, Mr. Sphinx. Wanna walk out with me?\" He nodded, only then realizing that he was still holding her hand. He dropped it, grabbing is drenched coat and following the girl, waiting by the main door as she locked it. She tested it and turned, waving as she made her way to the Cayenne. \"Well, I'll see you around. Have a good night.\" And with that, she closed the door and started the engine. When she pulled out of the lot, he noticed something interesting about her car. Not only was it a Turbo but it had a surf rack on top. Huh. Well, that explained the bare feet and callouses. As he crawled into the Malibu, he grimaced as he heard his wet jeans squeak against the leather. He moved again, trying to get comfortable only to her more squeaks and squishes. Oh he was going to kill Mirror if this ruined his upholstery. As he pulled out and made his way to his apartment, he didn't notice his mind wondering to the petite little blond that had just plopped herself in with their crew until he was entering his key code for the parking complex. He growled at himself. The girl was too young and far too naïve for him to even think of messing with. Besides, Otto would figure out a way to have his skull. Plus, he'd seen the way Tumbler had been eying the girl as she and Kip had talked. Better to leave the emotional shit to the younglings. As he entered the building and got on the elevator he couldn't help the stray thought that passed through his mind. It had been a while since he'd been in any form of relationship, physical or otherwise. Which is probably why he'd noticed her to begin with. Besides, boy-o what would she want with you? I know, I know. It's weird but bear with me. Later![Chapter 5] Okay boys and girls this one is all new! Enjoy! Confrontations and Decisions Life in Long Beach was nothing like she'd been expecting . . . but it wasn't stopping Chaos from jumping in with both feet and enjoying the little things for the past two weeks. The younger members of Otto's work force had taken to spending time with her and helping with the renovations to the office and Records Room . . . which was fucking awesome on one hand because that meant help for her. Which was how she and Tumbler were currently in Kip's Hum Vee, going to pick up the new desk and chairs for the office of the garage. She'd ever convinced her uncle to let her paint and redo the office in addition to the Records Room was a mystery to everyone but she'd done it and those tasks had kept her steadily engrossed in something other than the drama that had settled into the shop since her arrival. She'd had to apologize to Bob, regardless of her and the others protests, for the sake of peace . . . but it hadn't won her any other fans among the restorers, though. As a matter of fact, the only restores that seemed to tolerate her were the old crew runners and that was just barely with the exception of Sway and Atley. Donnie wasn't around enough to really count and Memphis seemed to busy trying to keep peace to be bothered with being polite or friendly. The rest seemed content to make her life hell. She'd come close to snapping necks a few times since she'd taken over filing and running the office part of Otto's operation . . . and not just Bob's. Apparently, just because she didn't look like the kind of girl who should know her way around a car or the inner workings of one . . . automatically everything she said was stupid or insane. Despite the fact that every single suggestion she made turned out to be right or at least a better course of action than what was originally proposed . . . She sighed, slumping into the seat as Tumbler took the turn into the furniture store a little fast than necessary. He glanced at her, pulling into the loading zone before cutting the engine. \"You okay?\" She nodded, grabbing her bag and hoodie before opening the door. She heard him scramble to get out of the Hum Vee and catch up with her. She smiled. Tumbler reminded her of her brother Mikhail so much it was almost like having him there, leading her to being inclined to spending a little more time with him than the others . . . which had thrilled the goofy boxer to no end. Apparently, he didn't \"want her body\" as Mirror had loudly proclaimed his first day back in the shop . . . or that's what he said. She grinned, remembering how red Tumbler had turned before he socked Mirror in the chest hard enough to knock the wind out of him. He'd been so embarrassed . . . . But he'd come clean. He'd had a girl he'd been talking to off-and-on for years and while they were currently on the outs (permanently according to her) he still had some hope that she'd come around again. Of course that didn't stop him from going on for a few minutes about how gorgeous she was. And that if the other girl didn't come around soon he might reconsider asking her out before Chaosia had finally laughed and let him off the hook. She'd even promised not to tell the others about the girl to protect his reputation as a Casanova (one he apparently deserved when he was girl friendless). Thus the pact was made. Tumbler would help her with the office and the homesickness and she would help him with the girl. Though honestly so far they were getting more done on the office. Which was fine by Tumbler, apparently. He was happy to help her help Otto and the girl was a bitch . . . which lead to the downside of the constant younger crew company. The constant flirting and \"subtle\" hints to go places with one or all of them. She appreciated the gesture but she was seriously considering telling every single one of them she was gay. Hell, she could even have Monique come up for a few days and pretend to be her girlfriend . . . okay. That was definitely a last resort. She grinned, reaching her hand out for him to follow as she walked into the store. Sales clerks and customers alike gave the two of them odd looks as they-well she-practically skipped, all the way to the Customer Service desk. Tumbler groaned, muttering about how his macho-ness had just dropped twenty points every time she giggled or stopped him to show him something cute while they waited for their merchandise. She grinned, leaning over and giving his cheek a quick pinch just in time for two burly stockers to see it. They grinned and winked to the now flabbergasted boost. She wasn't so cruel as to completely make an idiot out of him . . . yet. She needed a few more weeks to get to that level of evil. Besides, she knew they looked odd. Tumbler in his black tee shirt and jeans, the chain in his pocket as permanent a feature as his clunky black boots . . . and her in her cropped jeans and the light oatmeal colored cardigan with ¾ sleeves over the white lacey tank top and flip flops. His hair spiked and spastic and hers a living mass of gold curls. His chunky silver rings and her dainty key necklace. She smirked, nodding to the dazzled rep who was openly drooling at her friend. They had to pick up the items she'd ordered, without being mauled . . . then they were going to eat . . . preferably somewhere other than the Quality Cup. Sphinx stood in the doorway to the freshly painted office at the front of Otto's, momentarily dazed. He looked back, making sure he'd walked into the right room. Kip and Toby were pulling painter's tape off of the walls, exposing the metal beams they'd taped over to protect. The fresh coat of greyish beige made the rusted and weathered steel supports seem even brighter while the windows (which had been scraped clean but otherwise left alone) added enough light to the room that the circular hanging light fixture they'd installed yesterday was almost excessive. Chaos had made the chandelier herself, using an old grill from one the fallen classics in the local junkyard, then run lights down and into the well she and Tumbler had welded onto the edges. What amazed him was that she'd used ties to secure old tin oils cans, random bottles and jars, all filled with sea glass to reflect the colors, around the edged lip. He had to admit that while odd it did fit with the other things here in the office she was making. Junie and Otto had let her have full reign, Junie handing over the funds to update the office before Otto had been able to say no. And telling Memphis she wanted them to help the girl if she needed it. So far the younger crew had been at the forefront, making any of the Old School's presence pointless and wasteful . . . but today he and Atley would be helping them lads move the rest of the furniture and shelves in place, meaning the near end of the update to both rooms. He strode into the room, looking at all of the little odds and ends the girl had tucked away in the sea grass baskets, ready to hang and organize once they got back. He nodded once, further impressed. To be such a flighty little thing she was actually good at all of this . . . she had a mind for organization it seemed. And she had very quickly put Otto's books and stock rooms to rights, as well as his filing systems. She'd brought in eleven new file cabinets into the revamped Records Room, or so Kip had told Memphis, and had ordered two cases of forms for the restores to use with carbon copies to avoid the misplacings and miscommunications that happened more often than not. Toby had set up a network and included her laptop on it, allowing her let the main desktop stay in the main office while her laptop could float from work station to work station if need be . . . or be left to charge in the Records Room when she was busy filing or working. Sphinx shrugged, grabbing a coke out of the old-new cooler and going to stand against the now scrubbed and cleaned tin back wall of the large office. He watched Kip and Toby clean up their mess and start to gather the drop cloths, amazed at what they uncovered. Instead of the concrete that ran everywhere else in Otto's, the girl had gone out and bought hardwood floors to put down in both rooms and the bathroom she'd redone for the waiting clients. Atley walked in just in time to see the floors being uncovered and raised a brow at him. He shrugged as Kip and Toby took notice of their guests. Finally, atley couldn't take it anymore. \"Where in the hell did the floor come from?\" Toby shrugged as Kip explained. \"Chaos saw where they were tearing down the old gymnasium at the YMCA near her house and went in and asked if she could buy some of the wood from the floors. They gave her enough to do all three rooms for free, saying they were glad she was going to recycle it. She and Tumbler put it down yesterday while Mirror and I wired the lights in the Records Room and the bathroom. Mirror actually just finished this big sucker, \" He pointed up to the main light fixture, \"Before we went to take down the tape.\" Atley kept looking at the room, obviously amazed at the transformation. Toby grinned. \"Pretty cool, huh? She's actually really good at this stuff . . . \" Atley nodded, the sound of the Hum Vee pulling up drawing all of their attention to the main door. Sphinx pushed away from the wall. It was time to go to work. He just hoped the girl didn't run into him. Again. She'd already run head first into him twice . . . and he was steadfast in his decision to not save her if she tumbled again. As they went to go help unload the desk, the sound of voices rising caught their attention. As Sphinx and Atley rounded the corner, followed closely by Kip and Toby, they got a full view of Chaosia glaring at Bob while the braced and bruised man cursed at her. Tumbler was between them, putting as much distance between the two as possible. Atley raised a brow as Sphinx growled. Neither of them had ever cared for the tubby restorer . . . even when Otto's had been a true chop shop. But to see him yelling at a girl nearly half his size was enraging . . . until Atley remembered that said girl was responsible for the brace and bruises. It was easy to see Chaos and dismiss her because of the way she looked and dressed. Her attitude, all smirks and sweet sarcasm mixed with sincerity and an honest desire to work and be accepted, didn't really fit what the boys had said they'd seen her do . . . but the way she was glaring at the larger man made it easy to see that her appearance and attitude were her greatest weapon. It made people relax and lower their guard. That way they never expected the damage she inflicted. Kip went to step around him to go help but Sphinx caught the boy by his shirt, shaking his head once. Atley raised a brow as the towering man stepped forward to go break it up. This was new. Sphinx rarely got involved in anything, choosing to just float around the edges of their groups rather than constantly engage in whatever they were doing . . . Atley fell into step beside Sphinx, hoping to see what was going to happen. As they got closer they heard Bob smart off at Chaosia again. Though it sounded much less threatening through the clenched teeth the jaw brace gave him. \"I don't care what Halliwell says, girl. You don't belong here anymore than they do. You think because you're some pretty little piece of ass then we'll all just bend to your will? We didn't do it for Wayland and we sure as hell won't do it for a scrawny thing like you.\" She glared; reaching around Tumbler and catching the man square in the nose with her fist twice before Tumbler threw her over his shoulder and took three big steps back. Atley and Sphinx both stopped, amazed. She hadn't hit him hard enough to do anything but make his eyes water and hurt his pride. Which would effectively cover her from Otto's wrath should Bob blab. Smart girl. Atley stepped around, pushing Bob out and back to his work station before she got loose and killed him for real. He would have to talk to Memphis. Apparently, the young crew weren't enough to deter these guys from antagonizing the girl . . . which meant that more likely than not they would be playing babysitter until things cooled down. Just fucking great. Hours later Chaos sat in the now finished office, surveying her and the others work. Anything to keep her from remembering that practically everyone here hated her with a passion . . . The dark desk was settled to separate the large room, defining the two spaces. Behind the L shaped desk, a row of short filing cabinets sat with various knick knacks and office supplies, all in varying shades of silver and bronze, arranged atop them. The desk itself house the computer, a newer flat screened monitor the only visible component. A large silver replica of the Monopoly car sat to the far side of the desk, effectively hiding the wireless mouse from view. On the opposite side of the desk, two huge overstuffed arm chairs, decked out in charcoal fabric with tiny pewter pinstripes, sat at angles, facing the desk while circling the large black leather ottoman she'd chosen to act as a coffee table. On the far wall, under the windows, two smaller teal leather chairs sat almost flush against the wall with two small mirrored trunks between them. An old inverted Cadillac hubcap sat atop the trunks, acting as a tray, holding the silver bowl of candy and the crystal ashtray. The huge brown and cream cowhide rug sat beneath the main area, protecting the floors and adding a softness to the room without being too feminine. Overall, she was proud of how it'd turned out. Industrial, modern but still fashionable . . . and very male. A knock on the glass and wooden door drug her out of her thoughts. She stood, going to answer it. Now who on earth could this be? Memphis Raines stepped into the Office and Seating Area, surprised at the difference. Chaos had really out done herself with this. He shook himself, remembering the task at hand. This wasn't going to be pretty. He went over, sitting in one of the arm chairs as he motioned for her to join him. She sat, suddenly looking tired and weary of him. \"Chaosia . . . I want you to know that what I'm about to say isn't because I dislike you.\" She nodded, bracing herself for the worst. He could see her pulling in and getting ready for the rejection and warning she thought was coming. Lord, he didn't want to do this. \"Look, I'm going to have one of the older members stay with you in here while you work . . . just to keep the peace. Eventually, you'll be able to be alone but until Bob's gone or muzzled, I don't want you in here by yourself. Sway's told me how he can get and I don't want to have to mop up any more blood.\" She sat there, stunned. \"So that's it? You're giving me a babysitter? You're not telling me to leave your crew alone and take care of myself?\" And Memphis suddenly felt even more like shit. This kid had really thought he was coming in here to tell her she wasn't welcomed? He shook his head. \"No. You're Otto's family. So that make you our family. And we take care of family. Besides, Kip and the others need to go back to working for Otto so one of us in here will make that happen . . .\" He smirked. \"And give you some peace from Tumbler. Toby and Kip said he'd been laying it on kind of thick . . .\" She snorted, slumping into the chair. \"Thick doesn't begin to cover it. He's sweet-they're all sweet-but I don't want that from any of them . . . I don't mind the friend part, though.\" He nodded. \"I'll tell them to lighten up if they don't soon, okay? Just . . . go home and get some rest. Let us take care of you while you're here.\" She nodded, looking out the windows as he stood to leave. As he got to the door, she stopped him. \"Memphis?\" He turned back, brow raised. She smiled at him, and he could see that her eyes were watery. \"Thanks for giving me a chance. I know it's not easy trusting some new, random person.\" He nodded, chuckling as he shut the door. He was big enough to admit that he was wrong about Chaos. She was a good kid but she could hold her own . . . but what he'd said was true. Like it or not, she was family. And she wouldn't have to hold her own here. Not if they had anything to do with it. I know, it's so weird but I swear it'll all make since. Later.[Chapter 6] Some revision here . . . not much though. Dinner and Dad Chaos grumbled as she looked up and saw the huge man known as the Sphinx standing in the doorway. Apparently it was his turn to babysit her and make sure she didn't kill any of the other restorers. As Memphis had predicted, Bob's plight (and bruises) had won sympathy with a few of the older workers and they were constantly making remarks. And sorely testing her thinning patience . Otto himself had had to lay down the law and explain that she was his goddaughter and Junie's family to keep the whole mistress scenarios from gaining popularity. He'd also issued a warning that Bob should serve as a lesson. Leave her be or bleed. And threatened her Porsche with the full chop shop treatment if she didn't keep her temper under tight control. She'd sighed and nodded, agreeing as long as no one was stupid enough to actually touch her . . . and then she'd spent at least thirty minutes apologizing and swearing that she wouldn't cause any more trouble for him or her beloved Aunt. Memphis's speech about family had made her realize that even though she hadn't meant to, she was putting her own in a tight spot. Otto had sighed and told her that though he was surprised with how viciously she'd reacted, he couldn't really blame her. She, according to him anyway, had inherited her temper and love of fighting from her rowdy father and uncles. He'd told her about how he'd met her Dad when he brought a boosted lady to him. He'd apparently been bloodied and bruised and laughing . Chaos still smirked when she thought about it. That sounded just like her old man. Though he rarely got the chance to do anything other than joyride with her these days she knew he'd been one of the best in his day. No import or classic stood in his way, especially European ladies. It apparently has something to do with the fact that he was, despite his now ingrained 'American behaviors' (as her grandmother called them) British to the bone. If he got mad enough, the slight accent he had thickened and the infamous British insults rolled right off his tongue. Apparently, that was something else she got from her father. She sighed again as she heard two of the older restorers pass behind Sphinx. The stoic man had turned and looked at them, sending them scurrying back to whatever car they were working on which had her wondering about just what they'd been saying. So far all she'd really had to deal with were a few snide comments and cold shoulders, aside from the incidents with Bob directly . . . but Memphis had felt that when one of his crew was there and not working on a project that they could come keep her company. And he was holding to his decision. Now another week later, she was about ready to pop. Her classes started in a week, thank God, but she didn't think the semester was going to begin fast enough. It wasn't that she minded the company. Far from it. As a matter of fact, Kip and Tumbler found their way to her cave more often than not, usually dragging Toby or Freb with them. Which was usually a great source of entertainment . . . but it left her with work to do even after she got home. Which is why while she appreciated their conversation, she was silently thankful for her watcher today . . . despite her resentment at the forced company. The man was quiet and peaceful, letting her work without disrupting it and getting in the way (if you didn't count having to force herself not ogle him as getting in the way, that is). Or asking a million stupid personal questions . Tumbler had taken it upon himself to personally insure that she didn't have a dull moment at the garage. So he'd taken to playing the twenty million questions game. His favorites being about her guy preferences and if she had a boyfriend of a lover. Apparently he and the old flame were truly through and he was trying to get a feel for her. And her habits. Like she'd tell him so he could let it slip in front of Otto. She knew her uncle was aware of the fact that she was all grown up but she highly doubted he or Junie would like to hear the details of her sex life spilling from Tumbler's lips at their next group function or cook out. She snorted, unknowingly drawing Sphinx's eyes to her as she pushed one of the new filing cabinets in place under the huge cork and erasable marker message board she'd purchased for the room. Now that the cabinets were in place all she had to do was lay the salvaged table-top-turned-desk-top on them and voila! Instant workspace without sacrificing moving space. She glanced up, seeing one of the eight messages Kip and Tumbler had pinned to the cork portion of the board about going out to drink at Sway's work with them tonight. Their whole crew was going and they were insisting she went. \"Maybe it is time to tell them that I'm gay . . . I wonder if they'd stop already.\" She turned, dusting her hands and noticing for the first time that her company's eyes were on her, obviously shocked. She blushed, pushing her bangs out of her face and pulling her cardigan closer around her. Something about the way he looked at her made her feel like the tank top and distressed boyfriend cut cropped jeans with the sweater (while normal for her) was too . . . plain . She pushed her tortoise shell glasses back up her nose, suddenly wondering why she had them on in the first place. Sure she needed them to read but still. Finally, she cracked under the intensity of his still very shocked glare. \" Well? They're aggravating with all of the ' subtle' hints to go to dinner and drink. I mean seriously. I'm not gay but they don't have to know that.\" Sphinx snorted, shaking his head and coming into the now much larger space. It was amazing what cleaning out all of the junk could do. He sat in the chair at the filing station, looking over the room with a critical and observant eye, as if taking in all of the changes she'd made in the last three weeks. Chaos, sensing that was the end of their limited interaction, went and grabbed the most current invoices, filing them away as she found the completed ones. She worked steadily, reducing the heaping pile to only a handful in what seemed like no time before her stomach growled. She looked up, blushing at the quirked brow and incredulous expression on Sphinx's face. Why was she always acting like a flake in front of this guy? In addition to running head first into him the night of Mirror's Smurf Bath, she'd tripped over the damned dog the second day she'd known him (forcing him to catch her before she cracked her skull on the concrete). And instead of thanking him she'd promptly turned and yelled at the huge mastiff before thinking about how it made her look. It made her look like a nut job is how it'd made her look . She sighed. Of course she would go into her infamous grace mode around the one guy she thought was attractive and bearable . . . She blushed as her stomach growled again, turning to look at the clock. It was almost six at night . . . She would have to eat soon. She looked at him, deciding to be friendly. \"Hey, do you want to grab some food? I mean, nothing fancy just some takeout or something. I'm starving.\" He looked at her like she was insane before his features darkened. She sighed. Of course he wouldn't want to . He apparently was on the \"Chaos is a stupid kid with no business here\" side of the fence. Maybe Atley was still floating around outside. He would eat with her if she begged and pleaded and promised to pay. Not that he'd let her but still, he apparently liked to see her grovel. She shrugged. \"Never mind . . . just forget I asked. You can go if you want to, I'm sure that no one's going to do anything other than whisper harshly.\" Sphinx stood, gathering his coat and went to the door. Chaos looked back down to the invoices in her hand, refusing to let the fact that he obviously wanted to be out of her presence sting more than it already did. When she looked back up, sure he'd already left, she was shocked to see him standing there waiting. After a few seconds he took the files from her and laid them on the workstation before handing her canvas hobo bag and pointing to her tan Rainbow flip flops. Chaosia just looked at him, momentarily amazed before sliding on her shoes and taking her bag. She cut out the light and locked the door, making sure the file holders she'd put on the door were empty before turning to him. \"Okay. Now what? \" He held an arm out, indicating he would follow her. She quickly made her way to her car, ever aware of her silent shadow. She hit the auto unlock and let him in, turning off the alarm. He gave her a deadpan look and she suddenly felt stupid for turning the alarm on or even locking the damn thing. She blushed. \"Old habits from school die hard. My old school wasn't exactly in the best neighborhood. And the thieves weren't boosts. The alarm went off and they'd scatter. That's why Dad picked it. To keep honest men honest, you know?\" Sphinx nodded, seeming to understand the logic. She cranked the car, pulling out of the lot and onto the service road. As she made her way into the heart of Long Beach, she realized she knew nothing about what this man ate. Or anything else about him at all for that matter. She could have very well just gotten into the car with a damned hatchet murder and she wouldn't be the wiser. As they rolled to a stop for a light, she turned to him. He was looking over the white interior and charcoal detailing of the car, obviously impressed. She cleared her throat, causing him to look at her. \"So, where to?\" He shrugged, apparently leaving it up to her. When the light turned green, she made her way to the Quality Cup Café. She'd eaten lunch there with Memphis and Sway the day before (not to mention more than a few times with Kip and Tumbler) and the menu offered a little of everything so it was the safest bet. As they pulled into the parking lot, he raised a brow at her choice but shrugged, getting out of the car when she killed the engine. They quietly made their way to the back of the dinner, taking one of the bigger back booths in the far corner as their own. Chaos was reading the menu when she felt eyes on her. She looked up and sighed, seeing Sphinx looking at her intently. She looked back to her menu and groaned. Today was just not her day . Everything she did just seemed to annoy or puzzle this guy. Why had even come if he didn't want to be around her? She sighed, looking at Sphinx and catching one of his balled hands under hers before she really thought about it. The light contact brought his furious grey green eyes to hers and she blushed under the intensity they held. \"Uh . . . What do you usually get? Sway and Memphis got these sandwich plates the other day but I want real food. Any suggestions? \" She blushed darker as he got the other menu and scanned it, pointing to the pot roast dinner. She nodded. It sounded good. She smiled, not realizing until he moved that she'd still had her hand on his and moved it as the waitress came and asked for their drink orders. She tried not to dwell on the dark look Sphinx donned when the woman left. After this she would leave him alone . Even if it killed her. Sphinx grumbled, glaring at the waitress when she practically threw there Cokes on the table, declaring she'd be back to get their orders in a minute. Chaos was looking after the woman like she was crazy. She looked at him then, causing something in Sphinx's gut to clench again. That look said that maybe she was having second thoughts about this and he wasn't too fond of it. \"So. What do you want? The pot roast?\" He nodded, pointing to the sides as he saw their very rude waitress making her way back after talking to someone behind the counter. This had been a bad idea. The restaurant, not the actual attempt to eat. She turned and smiled at him then. \"Well, I'm personally looking at this T-Bone steak. Do you think she could get it right if I ordered it medium?\" Sphinx snorted, causing Chaos to giggle and shake her head before shutting down all together. Apparently she was having the same idea about the place he was. \"I know she'll freak but I think I'm going to brave it.\" She placed their orders, causing the woman to look at her like she was crazy before going back to put in for their food. When the waitress was gone, Chaos started to look around the dinner, obviously trying to find something to settle her gaze. Sphinx watched her look around. She had the same expression she did the other night, looking at everything and taking in as much detail as she could without giving herself away in the process. A few more minutes of inspection and she sighed, reaching into her bag and pulling out a notebook, pen and a highlighter. Sphinx raised a brow as she opened to what appeared to be class notes and started to highlight something. She would look, then flip back and reread something then go forward and correct of highlight what she was working on. She must have felt his stare because she looked up and blushed. \"Sorry. I remembered something that I needed to change. I know my classes don't start for another few weeks but these are all labs this semester. I have to keep the lecture notes organized to help with them or I'll go crazy.\" He shrugged his brows. Smart. He peered over discretely as he reached for his drink, seeing that her handwriting was actually legible. Unlike Otto or even Sway's. No wonder the garage was running a bit more smoothly in such a short time span. The restorers could actually read their instructions now. He shook his head slightly, remembering more than one occasion a restorer or one of the crew having to come to Otto or Sway (and Memphis when he was in a hurry) for a translation of their script. He personally worked with other doctors and medical professionals most days so deciphering the scrawling jumble of lines was second nature on the occurrences that he helped Otto now. But he was glad that Atley wouldn't be tracking him down to ask 'what some word was' for a while. She shrugged, pushing the notebook across to him as she'd caught him peeking. \"It's the research for my doctoral thesis. Well, part of it anyway. I know I'm starting a little ahead but there's no such thing as too early with something like this.\" Sphinx scanned the notes, feeling his eyebrows rise up almost into his hairline. Her research method was almost flawless and she had Empirical documentation and reasoning behind everything, written out just in case someone questioned. He looked up at her, seeing her in new light. She wasn't just some awkward kid or pop-up relation to Otto. She was here in Long Beach because she was serious about this. And, from what he was reading, she was damn good at what she did. The waitress came and dropped their plates, refilling their drinks before disappearing into the kitchen. He watched her literally dissect her steak before trying to take a bite of the dripping bleeding thing. He didn't know why but the fact that she wasn't afraid to eat was almost . . . endearing. \"Why sharks?\" She looked at him, face frozen in shock with her mouth open and the tidbit of steak hanging on her fork. She blinked, clearing away her confusion. \" Excuse me?\" He rolled his eyes. He knew he hardly spoke but seriously. \"Why sharks ? For your thesis.\" She was still looking at him like he'd grown a second head but shook herself and answered him, flipping through the thick notebook to some of the actual notes on her thesis subject. She handed it back, their food forgotten as she started talking. \"Well, sharks have been unchanged by evolution for millions of years. They're practically one of the closest links to living dinosaurs that he scientific community can find, other than birds and crocodiles. They're also one of the few marine species that can give live birth rather than eggs with rookeries. Though that really depends on the type of shark you're talking about. Take the Carcharodon carcharias , commonly known as the Great White.\" He nodded, letting her continue. He was personally amazed at how much she opened up when talking about her major. He smirked mentally. No wonder she's so dark. She practically lives on the beach and in the ocean. \"The white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world and the only species of the genus Carcharodon that has survived throughout the ages. The rest of the species have gone into extinction, including the Carcharodon megalodon . Whites are usually between 12-16 feet long, but specimens have been reported up to 19-21 feet. They also have an average of 3000 teeth that regrow when others are lost due to feeding and age.\" Sphinx watched her take a bite of what was sure to be a now cold steak before continuing. \"Whites are rare though because they can actually jump out of the water and grab prey. I've seen them jump and it's amazing. They actually launch out of the water and then sort of fall back in on their backs. They don't really have bones, other than their jaws everything else is this cartilage skeletal system, so it doesn't hurt them the way a fall like that would us. And I have officially been rambling on about sharks for at least thirty minutes so I'm going to stop now.\" She took a deep breath before eyeing him. \"So, you can talk. And from the accent you're British.\" He nodded, taking another bite of his pot roast as he braced himself for the onslaught of questions and the invasion of privacy. He knew where this was going. She looked at him intently for a few seconds before shrugging and going back to eating. He had to admit he was more than a little shocked. The others had tried for months after the Calitri incident to get him to speak and she was just going to accept it and let it go? Just what in the hell was this girl? As she polished off the rest of her steak and began to mutilate the poor baked potato that had come with it, she mentioned. \"My Dad's British. He's been in the States since he was a teenager but he was actually born in London.\" Sphinx quirked a brow at that tidbit of information, but nodding for her to continue. She shrugged, pouring the melted butter over the potato and salting it before taking a bite. She grimaced and added more salt and pepper before continuing. \"He and my grandfather didn't get along apparently so he left when he was eighteen and came here. He liked the West Coast and settled, though he stayed out East for a while. He and Otto used to work together when they were younger . . . That's how Otto became my godfather.\" She stopped, giving him a lopsided smirk and winking before continuing. \"That and he introduced Otto to Aunt Junie.\" Sphinx blinked letting the information sink in then almost dropped when his brain put two-and-two together. \"You're the family Junie goes to see every year right? You and your Mom?\" Chaos nodded, taking a huge bite of potato. When she'd swallowed she answered. \"Yeah. Mom and Junie are technically second cousins but they were raised like sisters . . . My Mom and Dad actually introduced Junie to Otto back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.\" Sphinx chuckled, shaking his head. The girl was a riot when she was at ease. \"That's why they thought you'd be good here while at school then?\" She nodded, pushing her now empty plate to join his. \"I guess. I think the real reason is though that my brothers are notorious for getting themselves and usually me in trouble . . . and with their last stunt I was bound to get caught up in it. So with school starting and everything, Mom and Dad thought that giving me their old house here and putting me with Otto as a steady influence would help keep me out of trouble . . . Like I would be stupid enough to drive a damn Koenigsegg CCX off a pier just to piss someone off.\" Sphinx stopped. \"Come again?\" She rolled her eyes and told him about her brothers and their exploits. It seemed that while her eldest half-brother (from her father's first marriage) was all proper and snotty that her half-brother from her mother was more like her . . . just rowdier and crazier. The two argued constantly but had joined forces to 'combat a common foe'. The common foe being her ex and the choice of combat being dumping his car off the Seal Pier near the Children's Pool, after Mikhail's girlfriend had dug cheating bastard into the paint, even though they'd been told to leave it alone. Sphinx could tell she was leaving something out but he didn't push. He knew about not wanting anyone else to see your biggest wounds and weaknesses. So he wouldn't rub salt in hers. \"And the worst part was that they filled his interior with fish! The Seals at the Children's Pool practically scratched the thing to pieces trying to get to it.\" Sphinx couldn't help it, he had to laugh. There was no way that the two boys had thought of that all by themselves. And from the mortified look on Chaos's face the idea had probably been hers and she'd never expected them to act on it. She watched him laugh and shook her head, chuckling. \"So you can kind of see why they want us apart for a while . . . We cause too much trouble together. Especially when we put our minds to it.\" He nodded, picking up the check as she stood. She glared and held her hand out to him. \"Hand it over Chatterbox . I'm not even going to let Memphis, Atley and you pay for my food in one week. I do get paid for all of that back breaking pencil pushing you know.\" He turned, ignoring her and walked straight to the counter, leaving her to follow him in a huff. When they got to the front, the cashier paled and took the ticket, ringing their bill all without speaking or looking up. When she was done, she squeaked out their total. \"$27.94 please.\" Sphinx went to get his wallet when a tanned hand flashed in front of him, tossing two $20s at the apparently shocked woman who barely caught them. Chaos flitted by him out the door, calling out, \"Keep the change! And don't let him argue about it either.\" Sphinx and the cashier shared a look, though his was of exasperation and hers was off shock and terror at having to tell him no. Finally, when the girl looked ready to hyperventilate, he nodded and walked out the door behind Chaos. Who was already in the running car and opening her sunroof while she chatted animatedly with someone on the phone. \"Tell Dad that I'm fine and to quit worrying so damn much. I know he's my father, Bastian and yes I know it's his right to worry. But seriously, eight voicemails and seventeen missed calls is slightly overkill. I know I'm not answering the phone at the house. Why? Because I'm not at the house.\" She stopped, laying her head on the steering wheel as he opened the door and got in, glaring at her. \"What do you mean he's on his way? He's driving the twenty minutes to come and check on me because what? I didn't answer the phone? I'll kill him. I'm nowhere near my house!\" Sphinx looked at her, smirking darkly. Served her right for that stunt in there. Seriously, did she expect him to let her pay? He might not be a complete gentleman but he wasn't a total prick either. At least not all of the time. She growled, putting the car in gear. \"Fine. I'll go check on the big cry baby. He probably just wanted someone to get coffee with him anyway. Jeez.\" She tossed the phone in the backseat, turning and looking at Sphinx. \"Do I need to take you to your car first or are you okay taking a ride?\" He shrugged, settling in for whatever as she rolled her eyes. \"Of course you won't answer me. Well, I am officially kidnapping you and you have to go so there!\" He rolled his eyes but couldn't help to be curious at what he was about to walk into. Oh he was sure it was nothing he couldn't handle . . . but the way Chaos kept throwing glances his way had him wondering. What have I gotten myself into?[Chapter 7] You Live Here? Chaos glanced over at her silent passenger for the eighth time since she'd hit the road into her neighborhood. The Bixby Knolls was a nicer suburb of Long Beach and she knew that if anyone from the garage had ever been here it was because of a boost. Which had her a little on edge with her current company. She was sure Sphinx would behave but what about the others when she finally let them see her house? She might not like her neighbors but she didn't need the cops out here either. Especially with how her Uncle Otto had warned her to be wary of Detective Castlebeck and his partner Drycoff. If they so much as heard a peep of boosting they went straight to Otto's and started harassing the crew . . . that she was now (for better or worse) and impromptu member of. She sighed, pulling down one of the side roads towards her home. She sighed and pulled into the driveway, glancing over at Sphinx again. He was currently looking up through the windshield at her two story Spanish styled home. She sighed again. It was times like these that she really despised the fact that her father had come from the 'right kind of' family in Britain and had been so damn frugal with his boost earnings. He couldn't just blow it like any of the other million boosts she'd met in her lifetime? Oh no . Her father had laundered the money and invested, proof that he knew the lifespan of a boost was limited. And his investments had more than paid off. The interest alone on two of his smaller CDs paid the utility bills for his shop and for her youngest brother's private school tuition. And while that should have been something to be proud of, she found herself more often than not hiding it. She and Mikhail had never fit in with the yuppies the way Bastian had. Then again, his mother was a yuppie herself with pedicure bills that would pay for Mikhail's dream car so it was at least understandable for him. But she had taken after her father and her mother. She liked to work and to be outside. She loved the ocean and most of the things in it. And she didn't care about what other people thought of her as long as they were judging her on her own merits. But people always treated her differently after they saw her house or the cars . . . which is why she'd been trying to stall bringing anyone from the garage out here. Hell even Otto and Junie hadn't seen the house yet. She turned and looked to Sphinx, killing the Cayenne's engine. \"Okay. I want to . . . just don't . . .\" She sighed, running her hands through her hair again. \"Just don't let this make up your mind about me okay? The house was a wedding present to my parents from my grandmother. She apparently realized that old age was worthless without family after my grandfather passed away. So to make amends, my Mother and Father got a six bedroom five and half bathroom house they've never stayed one night in. I'm the first family member to actually live here.\" \"What do you normally do with it?\" Chaos shrugged, getting out of the car and grabbing her purse. \"Dad usually rents it out. But the last tenants lease was up two months ago and Dad knew I'd need a place to live. He keeps telling me that I shouldn't lease an apartment when I could have a damn house for free . . . I just don't particularly like it. It's too . . .\" \"Big?\" She laughed, walking up the stone walkway to the door. \"Well, I was going to say pretentious but big works too. C'mon, I'll give you the grand tour while we wait on the Old Man.\" Sphinx was impressed. He had to admit it. The house was nice. Ultra nice. The entranceway alone was bigger than Otto's office . . . and Chaos had done well to make it feel like a home. The walls were painted a dark almond with white trim, making the dark hardwood floors seem to gleam under the Tuscan styled lights. A nice sized mahogany table rested just past the door with a huge bowl of sea shells and car keys at one end and a sea grass basket holding mail on the other. A mahogany timed mirror sat above it, reflecting he light from the table lamp. He shook his head, venturing into the huge living room. A large charcoal leather and tapestry sofa sat against the wall of windows, facing the stone fireplace. Perpendicular to it was a matching loveseat, both covered in huge pillows. A large coffee table sat in the center of the room, atop a cowhide rug similar to the one she'd used in the office. A painting of a Rolls Royce Silver Wraith hung above stone mantle, small car trinkets lining the shelve. On the back wall a chair was situated with a small writing desk, a row of vintage black and white car pictures above it. All and all the room looked formal but it was easy to see that a boost had lived here. Chaos walked away from him, going down the hallway and through another open doorway. \"I'm going to change shirts before Dad gets here. Make yourself at home. There's beer in the fridge and some cans of coke if your get thirsty. I'll be right back.\" Sphinx nodded, watching her disappear. He was right, this place was too big. Especially for her . It seemed to swallow her whole. As he left the living room and ventured into the kitchen he gave the curved dark mahogany cabinets and taupe granite countertops an appreciative glance, turning his attention to the stainless steel appliances. A huge range stove with hood, stacked double ovens and a large dual door refrigerator made the room seem modern and balanced the warm tones of the wood and the goldenrod walls. The tile backsplash carried the same tones as the granite, bringing the room together well. Four wooden barstools sat around the concave bar, tucked under the ledge and out of the way, each with ochre seats. The golden orange pendant lights glowed to life as he flipped a switch, bathing the bar with warm light. He shook his head and walked into the adjoining den. This room was larger than the first living room and much more casual. The right side wall was lined with ceiling to floor windows and curved the same way as the wall in the kitchen. A large curved beige sectional sofa sat in the alcove; an array of different jewel toned and patterned pillows tossed about it. Two large beige arm chairs sat against the opposite wall, each housing a corresponding pillow. Two huge chocolate leather ottomans were pushed together and acting as a large coffee table with a silver serving tray in the center holding a coffee cup and remotes to the TV and entertainment system on the only empty wall. The windows were framed by a long beige scarf that lightened the darker taupe walls of the room. A curved stair case took up the back wall, leading you up and into the second story of the house. But what drew Sphinx's attention was the huge chocolate leather arm chair tucked beneath the stairs, a wall sconce mounted beside it with a small table to its side. The ottoman nestled against it, a dark turquoise afghan tossed over it with a huge worn book atop that. A sound from the staircase brought his attention upwards. Chaos still had on her tattered cropped jeans but she'd put on a form fitting white turtleneck with long sleeves. She was barefoot, as usual. She smiled at him, blushing. \"Want to see upstairs? The only thing left down here is the laundry room and the prep kitchen off the garage.\" He raised a brow. \"You have two kitchens?\" She nodded, blushing like she'd just admitted she had a third eye or something. \"Yeah one's for the grill and stuff outside with this huge prep sink that's almost a bathtub. I doubt I'll ever use it. Come on.\" He followed her up the steps and looked into the bedrooms as she opened doors. There were apparently five regular bedrooms and one huge master suite. One had been turned into a proper English study and office with a huge mahogany desk and leather armchair to match the one under the steps. \"This is my office for school and work. The desk actually belonged to my great grandfather and was shipped here from England. MY grandmother had the walls recovered in the wallpaper and siding when she bought the place. My Dad refuses to set foot in here but I kind of like it. Besides, how many people have a desk that a Duke signed papers on?\" Sphinx shook his head at her but followed her back and out. The paintings of fox hunts and long dead British lords had taken him back to his earlier days in England . . . so he could understand her father's aversion to the room. Especially since he'd left on bad terms himself. Chaos showed him the room her youngest brother would be using when he visited for the summer, already painted a dark taupe grey with black furniture and red and white accents. He gave her a look as she rolled her eyes at one of the many robot statues and models. The connecting bathroom was in the same state. \"I swear he's going to turn into a car or robot or skateboard one day. He needs a damn girlfriend so I don't have to hear about Gundams all the damn time.\" The other three were decorated pretty much the same with the exception of different colored comforters and varying pictures. Her bedroom was what threw him, though. The large Cali King Four-poster bed was not what he expected. Instead of the dark wood that seemed to dominate her home, Chaos had chosen a light almost white colored wood set for this room. The posts of the bed were carved and decorated while the dark bronze canopy framed the top. The huge headboard was upholstered in matching leather that looked soft to the touch. The plush cream sheets and light aquamarine duvet made it seem airy, especially against the dark taupe walls with the turned down shimmering silver and turquoise comforter. What seemed like a thousand pillows crowned the head of the bed, still leaving plenty of room to stretch out and lay down. The windows were covered in cream sheers, breaking up the dark color. Silver framed pictures and mirrors were placed on the far wall, a mirrored dresser beneath them. Her bedside table was mirrored as well, with a remote control atop it beside the large seashell filled crystal lamp. He looked around, only seeing the white armoire the glittering dresser and the doorway to the master bathroom. She caught him looking and asked, \"What? Too girlie?\" He gave her a deadpan look and rolled his eyes, picking up the remote and handing it to her. She smirked before falling back on the bed. Sphinx closed his eyes, shaking his head at her antics. Seriously this girl was insane. He was so caught up in his mental evaluation that he didn't register her pulling him onto the bed until he was sprawled out beside her. She laughed at his shocked face before holding her arm, and the remote straight up. He looked up, seeing the silver flat screened TV flicker to life. Okay she wasn't insane. She was brilliant. She laughed as he looked at the TV in awe. \"No one hardly thinks to put them there, do they? I wasn't buying a stand to take up space. I mean sure, this is a 5028 sq. ft. house but still. I'm too graceful to have to remember where everything is in the middle of the night.\" A door opening and slamming caught their attention and Chaos groaned, shooting off the bed and down the hallway. Sphinx shook his head, getting up and following her at his own pace. The girl was going to be the death of him, he just knew it.[Chapter 8] Dads & Discussions Chaosia's father was nothing and everything Sphinx could have expected from his limited exposure to his daughter. The man was his height and had a solid, muscled build from the hard work he (apparently) did in his own shop. Not that he was looking, but it was hard not to notice that while the heather grey tee shirt was loose, it still clung to his chest and arms. His jeans were worn but of good quality, resting in a small pool over broken in brown penny loafers. Even his stance was relaxed and casual, much the way Chaos had been when she was deep into her shark lecture. What surprised Sphinx though was the fact that Chaos had taken after her father in coloring. He had the same golden strawberry blonde hair, though his had these patches of silver at his temples, and the same sea glass blue-green color of eyes. His mustache and goatee were trimmed and, despite the silver streak right in the center, the man did not look old enough to have boosted and chopped with Otto in his glory days. Hell, he looked closer to his and Atley's age than what he knew the man must have been to have not one but three adult children. All in all, if Sphinx had been a lesser man, he would have been more than slightly intimidated by the smiling and relaxed Edward Guadimus. As it stood, he was only slightly wary of the way the man kept looking from him to his babbling brook of a daughter. Sphinx looked down to Chaos and had to shake his head. She had her hands on her hips and was tapping one of her bare feet as she looked at father expectantly, not even the least bit phased by the sheer presence her father exuded. Seeing the difference in their size (and her similarly built brothers from the various pictures in her den) made him appreciate Chaosia's ability to stare him down unfazed. It also explained why she wasn't the least bit put off by him other than the initial start he'd seen when they first met. Where he was towering and intimidating to the others (save maybe Donnie and Atley) he was just normal for her. \"Well? What do you have to say for yourself, Dad?\" Her father just turned his attention to his daughter and smiled. Sphinx suddenly saw where Chaos got that dark little grin she'd worn when Sway smacked Memphis. And it was no less disheartening on her father. Lord, how had her other family survived with these two? \"I was only worried about my favorite daughter-\" She snorted, interjecting \"I'm your only daughter. And be serious. You thought I was out doing something stupid or was just ignoring you. I'm blonde , Daddy but I'm not an idiot .\" He continued, apparently more than accustomed to this retort. \"I know you're not, sweetpea . But is it so wrong for your old man to worry about you? Otto told me about the little ruckus at the shop. And how his boy Raines had taken to leaving a crew member with you . . . I just wanted to make sure you were okay.\" She sighed, crossing her arms and giving him a deadpan look that clearly told him and Sphinx that she wasn't buying his innocent concerned act. \"And to see where the closet Starbucks was to the house for when you and Mom are fighting and you're banished to my house, I bet.\" He laughed, stepping forward and pulling his daughter into a one armed hug, messing her curls with the other. The close proximity made their physical resemblance even more apparent and Sphinx had to wonder if her brothers had taken after the man at all for Chaos to be so much like him. And not in just appearance if his gut feeling was worth anything . . . and it almost always was. \"Am I so transparent then?\" She nodded, hugging him back before turning to Sphinx. She had this apologetic and pleading look to her eyes that screamed at him to both run and stay. It was the only warning she got before she turned a dark, pointed glare at her father. The cordial and friendly tone that spilled from her lips was the opposite of the look she was leveling on her still smiling father. Sphinx smirked internally. Apparently this was more her father's warning than his . \"Daddy, this is Sphinx. He's my Memphis-dictated babysitter today. Be nice .\" The man extended his hand, shaking Sphinx's more than a little firmly. Jesus the man had a grip. \"I'm Edward Guadimus, but nearly everyone calls me Eddie. Pleased to meet you boy-o.\" Sphinx knew his features darkened at the name but he schooled them back and nodded. He was not putting this man and Memphis Raines or Atley Jackson together . Ever. \"So. Are you a restorer with Otto or are you one of the illustrious Raines Crew members?\" Chaos turned, glaring daggers as her father laughed at his shocked expression. \" Daddy , Damn it! I told you to be nice!\" Eddie however just kept going, smiling down at Chaos good naturedly. \"I guess that means you're a crew runner. So . . . that must make you one of the Old School and not the young bloods. And since you're not saying no, or anything else for that matter, which makes you the one Otto keeps telling me reminds him of my oldest brother. You're the classics and muscle expert, right ?\" Sphinx shook himself, shocked that Otto had said anything period but not too bothered by the fact. A small part of him was actually flattered that the man thought highly enough of him to speak at all. He nodded and watched Eddie Guadimus's face break into another grin, this one all knowing. He seemed pleased with both Sphinx and himself but why the stoic man had no clue. But the smug air the man had taken on reminded Sphinx of a younger Memphis and of Kip and Tumbler. That there decided it. This man was definitely never going near any of the crew if he had to kill to accomplish it. His sanity wouldn't survive it. Eddie nodded, winking at him as he ribbed Chaos. \"Well, if you ever find a particularly difficult European Lady then ask this one to help. She's quite the enterprising little runner when she has to be.\" Sphinx's head shot to the now fuming girl as she smacked her father's chest. Hard . \"Damn it Dad. I only did it when Mikhail was stupid enough to take boosts he and Bastian couldn't do! And give it a rest. I don't want to boost, especially in Long Beach. It's their turf. Not mine.\" He held up his hands, stepping back. \"Easy, Chaos. I'm just kidding. I know you're not a runner, hon. Just breathe. Besides, without you there to bail them out maybe your brothers will wise up and make something of themselves other than nice looking corpses.\" She nodded, still glaring as she went to go to her back den. \" Well? Are you coming or are you going to stand there all night?\" Her father laughed, lopping an arm over her shoulder and grabbing Sphinx's shirt sleeve pulling the still flabbergasted boost with him as they walked. If he'd thought the man had a grip before it paled to the one he had on his damned shirt. He suddenly felt like a kid being taken to hand for some grave misdeed . . . and he did not like it one bit. As they crossed the threshold to the kitchen, he let both of them go and announced, \"Now, let's break out the beer and chat! I haven't seen you in forever!\" She rolled her eyes, giving Sphinx an apologetic look. \"It's been three days Dad.\" He sniffed dramatically causing Chaos to groan. \"I know and my baby's grown up so much already.\" \"Dad, seriously . I'm like twenty-four not five. \" Sphinx looked at her, shocked. She only looked twenty one at the most, just barely legal. But she was only a year younger than Kip? Jesus, did Memphis and the others know that or were they as clueless as he'd been? He decided that they were as in the dark as he had been . . . because that at least explained some of the reasoning behind Sway's almost maternal protection of the girl ( when she usually disliked most women period, with the rare exception of her longtime female friends) and the way that Donnie and Atley had taken to her. They honestly thought she was a kid. A smart kid, but a kid none the less, especially by their standards. Chaosia's now aggravated voice broke him out of his ponderings and brought him partially back to her and her father's bickering. The two were really too much alike to have lived together and not committed homicide. He was only half listening, wondering about where they'd hidden the bodies when her next statement brought him to full attention. \"Besides, I only have time for one drink because I have to take him to get his car and then I'm supposed to meet some of the guys from the shop for a few drinks.\" He and her father both looked at her, suddenly serious. Had she not acted earlier like she was going to pass on the younger crew's invitation? What had changed? He spoke before her father could. \"Oh, so you're not gay then?\" Chaos glared as her father took on an almost knowing look. The man was really too much. \"Oh! So, guys or a guy from the shop? You just be careful. Your brothers aren't here to drop another car into the surf if he hurts your feelings.\" Chaos rolled her eyes; hopping on the curved counter and accepting a beer form her father. Sphinx pulled out on of the barstools, her father following suit. \"Yeah well, one he didn't just hurt my feelings and two they overreacted. Besides, Dad. I'm a big girl.\" Eddie nodded grumbling. \"I know. And in your brothers' defense their hearts were in the right place. Too bad their brains didn't go along for the damn ride. I'm having to replace that damn car to keep the cops from being involved.\" He turned to Sphinx, who groaned internally. He knew this was going to be bad by the glint in the man's eyes. Just the way the man was looking at him let him know not only was he being sized up, he was also being judged . . . but for what purpose he didn't know. All he did know was he had discovered who Chaos took after in analyzing people and surroundings. Her father was just as talented and sneaky about it. \"So, you're a fellow Brit then? You been in the States long? You're accents still strong.\" Sphinx shrugged, deciding to answer but to keep them short and to the point. No need to have the girl going back and telling everyone that he'd been carrying on long, lengthy conversations with her behind their backs. He could just hear Atley if he knew he'd even spoken to the girl . For such a coldhearted boost, Atley's feelings could be hurt rather easily when their tentative friendship was the subject. Hell, the only reason he usually spoke period was because he knew Atley well enough to know that no conversation would have him doubting the fact that they were friends. He was worse than a bloody woman. \"About ten years. Just got tired of England.\" Eddie nodded. \"You and me both, brother. I swear they have rules for their rules. So, do you do anything other than boost?\" Chaos glared, draining half her beer as her father just looked at him expectantly. At least she wasn't fishing for the answers right along beside him. But for some reason, that thought bothered him even more than if she had been. He snorted mentally. He knew why it bothered him. If she'd been digging then it'd mean she was at least curious if not interested. Lord, he needed to get laid if her not asking questions was going to tear him up. Sphinx, breaking out of the melancholy turn his thoughts had taken, nodded. \"Yessir. I'm a pathologist with the Coroner's Office here in Long Beach.\" Chaosia looked at him, shocked as her father smirked. \"Huh. Well wonders never cease. Chaos here thought about that before she decided she liked sharks better. No idea why though. Seems a tad messy either way.\" He looked at his watch, stretching and tossing his now empty beer bottle in the garbage. \"Well, sweetpea, I'll be off then now that I know you're breathing. Your Mom and I'll be up sometime soon to help move the rest of your things. And your grandmother is thrilled that you're staying here. She even offered to sign it over in your name if you like it.\" He held up a hand, stopping her as she opened her mouth to refuse. \"Just humor the old girl, sweetpea. You can always sell the damn thing or donate it to charity or whatever it is you do with things you don't like.\" She nodded, hugging him as he went to leave the kitchen and go towards the door. He extended his hand again, shaking Sphinx's as he went to leave. \"Nice to meet you, boy-o. Good luck with this one. She's a hand full. You're ever in Seal Beach, stop by. We're always open to accepting a helping hand.\" And with that he was gone, leaving Chaos shaking her head and Sphinx wondering just what all Chaos wasn't telling them. Chaos knew she looked different in something other than damned jeans and a tee shirt. Lord knows that was part of the reason she changed. But she suddenly felt silly walking down stairs into her den when Sphinx looked at her like she'd grown a tail. Maybe she'd better just put the damn turtle neck and cropped jeans back on . . . She shook her head, deciding against it. She knew the white wouldn't stand up to whatever activity the others had planned and she wanted to look nice for her first official night out in Long Beach. She smoothed the dark distressed and ripped jeans skinny out as Sphinx looked away. The silky grey shirt wasn't her usual style with its low draped neckline and the almost nonexistent back with the silver studded leather t-strap that lead to a surplice banded hem . . . but she knew it but it was cute. And Mia and Paul had gotten it for her last birthday . . . And with the huge hipster studded belt over the jeans that were tucked in the 3.5\" heeled riding boots with studded detailing to match the belt . . . She'd be crazy to not think she she'd be turning heads tonight. All but the one she wanted to turn that is. She'd tousled her hair and had even put on make-up, rimming her eyes in dark shadow and donning ultra-glossy pale pink lip gloss. She'd even gone through the hassle of putting on the fabric wrapped and studded leather bangle set to match the damn shirt and belts and boots! She sighed, shaking her head and grabbing her coat from the coat closet. She knew Sway would love it at least. The cropped distressed motorcycle leather was almost grey from the treatment it had received . . . but she still loved its high collar and multiple tabs and buckles. And it stopped right where the back of the shirt began so if it got cold it was actually practical. Plus the inside was lined with a bright fuchsia silk so what was not to love? She turned, grabbing a different set of keys from the seashell bowl than the ones for her Cayenne. She was going out. Which meant she could actually drive her pride and joy . . . The gunmetal grey Saleen S7 Twin Turbo that had been her first graduation present from her father. She rarely drove it because of her speeding habits . . . but she figured if anyone could appreciate one of the fastest road legal cars in the freaking free world, then the younger boosters could. She might even let Kip drive it if he behaved . . . but definitely not Tumbler. She turned, seeing Sphinx coming up behind her. She sighed. \"C'mon chatterbox , let's go. I've got to drop you at your car before I can find the Anchor.\" He nodded, following her out the front door. She smirked when he looked perplexed at her opening the garage. The only thing she was thankful for in this damn house was that most of the square footage down stairs was eaten up by the three car garage. And while it meant that she had to park the Cayenne in the driveway most of the time it also meant she could keep the other cars safe from the elements and roaming eyes. Sphinx didn't wait to be told to examine the three cars parked in the garage, which had her wanting to giggle. The 2010 Carbon Black Aston Martin One-77 had been her grandmother's graduation present and though Chaos rarely drove it she did love the car. For all of their differences, she and the matriarch of the Guadimus family shared a taste in European cars. And the gleaming black Aston was a true work of art. Sphinx kept looking at it like it was a ghost until he spotted the Chevelle. She did giggle then. Of course the stoic owner of the Chevelle Malibu would be drawn to the SS. The black body was graced with two white Le Mons stripes and polished to perfection. She sighed. That was about the only thing perfect about it. She'd bought it with the money she'd made working for her dad and with her brothers and the damn thing hardly ever ran. But she wouldn't part with it. She had found it in a scrap yard so she couldn't really bitch about it not running right all of the time. She was going to have to break down and replace the motor this summer with the overage from her scholarships . . . Sphinx turned to her, brows raised. \"She doesn't run. I found her in the scrap yard and could let her go down, you know? I'm gonna have to replace the engine this summer. The only thing left to do, really. I've replaced the larger systems so now she just needs a new 350.\" Sphinx nodded, looking back at the car hungrily. At least he can appreciate the damn car . She walked around, going to the last car. Her baby . The Saleen was picture perfect inside and out, practically still of the showroom floor save for the mileage. And it would stay that way or she would kill someone. Sphinx just looked at the car, obviously in awe of it and she made a decision, tossing him the keys. \"Just don't kill her. She's my favorite.\" She knew he could drive. He had to be able to do what he did. So what would letting him drive back to the garage really hurt? But as she saw the dark glint come to his eyes, she started to doubt her sanity. She was really going to out this maniac behind the wheel of a $600,000 street legal race car? She shrugged, getting in the passenger side. Better him driving than her. That meant the ticket would go to him when they got pulled. And she was almost sure they would by the way he cranked the car and closed his eyes, listening to the engine roar to life. Sphinx was sure he was in love. There was no other way around it. He was head over fucking heels in love. With the most wonderful and amazing car he'd ever had the privilege of driving in his life. The Saleen made every other car, boosted or otherwise seem painfully slow. Hell, even his beloved Malibu was close to being knocked from first place as he raced through another red-light, leaving a blur and a trail of dust in his wake. Chaos, to her credit, was beside him laughing and shaking her head. Her hair caught his eye as she tossed it over her shoulder and looked out the window at the very quickly changing Long Beach scenery. He had to admit that he could understand her love of the Saleen. But she'd surprised him with the Chevelle parked in her garage. As he practically drifted into the gravel back lot of Otto's and to a stop, he started racking his brain to think of a place to find a new 350 for the parked beauty. He smirked, watching Chaos laugh as the dust and dirt his entrance had kicked up around them settled. She was an interesting little thing that was for sure . . . and for some reason he couldn't wait to see her behind the wheel of that SS. The mere thought of her in that car . . . He shook himself, spotting a very awed Tumbler a Kip standing beside the familiar Nova. Chaos smiled at him, leaning over and patting his hand. \"Well, you didn't kill us. But I am so sending you those red-light tickets to pay if they turn up.\" Sphinx shrugged. He'd pay the damn tickets and then some if it meant she'd let him at this car again. There was a particularly straight stretch near the marina that he was chomping at the bit to push the Saleen through. He'd heard they could go from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds and he was itching to test it. As he went to open the door, he asked, \"How fast does she go to 100?\" Chaos smirked. \"6.2 seconds. And I've topped her out at 215 before I backed off. But she wasn't even in the red yet . . . I know she'll do 248 on average.\" He nodded, almost giddy with anticipation. Well, as giddy as he got anyway. \"What's her name then?\" Chaosia smiled, winking. \"Her name is Io. My dad thought it was fitting, something about how he had to hide her from my mother for weeks before he could give her to me. I keep asking him when Mom's going to do something to drive her crazy.\" Sphinx shook his head, getting out of the car and tossing her the cars over the hood as she waved to Tumbler. Kip kept looking at them while Tumbler was honed in on the car, totally ignoring what was going on around him in favor of drooling over the supercar. Kip shook his head before greeting them. \"Hey Chaos, Sphinx. We figured we'd show you how to get to the Anchor since you've never been. You look . . . nice .\" She smiled, blushing and rolling her eyes. \"Yeah, thanks. Uh, you guys want to ride with me or do I need to follow you there?\" Tumbler jumped up, \"Kip can drive the Nova and I'll ride with you! I mean, if that's okay.\" Kip glared but then rolled his eyes and nodded as Tumbler pumped his fist in the air. \"YES! I've always wanted to see one of these. And you got to drive it Sphinx! Man was it awesome?\" Sphinx nodded, waving over his shoulder as he turned and started towards the Malibu. Tumbler and Kip shrugged and went to their respective cars for the evening. Thankfully neither noticed how Chaos stopped talking for a few seconds until Tumbler started begging to drive. \"No. I'm going to have enough tickets as it is from him. Maybe later.\" They continued the argument long after they'd gotten in the car and started making their way towards the bar. And Chaos was thankful for the distraction. It kept her mind off of her father and the way he'd acted with Sphinx. Her normally close lipped father never liked anyone she introduced him to but he'd been a regular chatty Cathy with Sphinx. It gave her conflicting feelings. That she hoped to drown in alcohol and laughter as quickly as possible. Sphinx sat in the Malibu, watching the Saleen and Nova pull off towards the Anchor. He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. He needed to back off or he was going to get in deep. The girl was too sweet for him to fuck her up, despite her coming from a similar background as most of the crew. He was contemplating disappearing for a few days when his phone went off, causing him to look for it. HE checked the number before looking skyward. It was Atley. He sighed and opened it, knowing that if he didn't he wouldn't get any peace. He listened as Atley started to chatter away. \" Hey Sphinx. You going to make an appearance down here tonight? Sway has us two pool tables and a tab on the house if you decide to want some company.\" Sphinx glanced at the time. It was only a little before ten. He could go and make an appearance before having to go home and get ready to bed down for tomorrow's work day . . . Atley's voice brought him back to the phone call. \" I'll even help you kick Mirror's ass for the blue dye bath. He's here and hiding out according to Toby and Freb.\" Sphinx nodded, closing the phone. That settled it. He was going for a damn drink. And then he was going to terrorize that damned boy for the rest of the night. He still had blue patches of skin that he couldn't get clean after almost three weeks. . . as did Atley and Memphis. Besides, what was the worst that could happen?[Chapter 9] Cutting Interests Sphinx was amazed as Sway and Chaos cleared the pool table for the fifth time since he'd been there. Apparently Chaosia was a pool shark . . . and against Memphis and Donnie there was definitely blood in the water. Sway was a damn good player on her own . . . but to pair her with Chaos was cruel and unusual punishment for whoever they were up against. Kip and Tumbler had already been dealt a devastating blow to their egos (and their wallets) early on. So they had been all but too happy to let Memphis and Donnie try their hand. Too bad Sway knew exactly how to move her leather clad backside to distract Memphis just enough to miss. Donnie, however, wasn't moved by the platinum blond boost (mainly because he refused to look at either her or Chaos when lining up a shot). But he was wary of Chaosia's wild shots and her eye for hidden strikes. She already fucked three of his line ups while sinking her own colors. And for the life of him, he and the others couldn't understand how. She was making shots that should have never worked and coming up clean every damn time. Thank goodness Donnie was such a good sport and Memphis was whipped or there could have been trouble . . . Then again with the way that a more than a few eyes from around the bar followed the two girls there was bound to be before the night was through anyway. Chaosia had long since shed her leather jacket and was currently bent over the table, lining up to break for her and Sway. It wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't drawn a crowd other than their crew . . . and if Chaosia's jean clad ass wasn't being ogled. What kept drawing Sphinx's eyes; however wasn't the jeans or even the shirt (but just barely), though both were hard to keep his eyes away from. It was the large, ornate phoenix tattoo scrawling over her left shoulder and disappearing beneath the grey shirt. He would have never guessed she would have ink . . . or at least ink like that . For some reason, when he'd heard her telling Sway she had a tattoo before, he'd pictured some sweet little flower or moon or some other girlie nonsense. He'd even halfheartedly agreed with the younger lads when they'd told her to shed the coat and let them see it, nodding when she'd looked over her shoulder at him. She'd blushed but shrugged, sliding the worn leather off and tossing it on a bar stool, turning to let them see the ornate and feminine black tattoo that was dancing over her shoulder blade. It had black lace on the edges of its wings that seemed to be unraveling and melding back into the tanned skin. Tumbler had been speechless (for once) while Mirror had whooped and nodded at her and Kip had whistled. And as the night wore on, and the drinks kept coming, he could honestly say that watching that bird on her tanned and toned back was pushing him closer and closer to do something rash and uncharacteristic. There were only so many things he could handle and watching her bend over again and again, making the muscle on her back actually ripple when she took a shot. . . He'd never thought he'd want someone with any obvious muscle. He'd always preferred the soft, curved and feminine . . . but watching Chaos made him realize that he just hadn't seen a woman with the right kind of muscle. Lord give him the strength to behave and not make an ass of himself. . . He turned, watching Sway cheer as Ripley sank two striped balls on her first shot, putting them ahead from the get go. Again. He smirked, taking a long draught of his Miller high life as he watched the two pass the pool cue and air kiss at each other giggling. Sway seemed more than happy to have a female cohort who could keep up with her drinking habits and that had led to them downing the two bottles of black label Jack sitting off on one of the tables. And the result was two very giggling and silly girls who were still nowhere near where as drunk as the others were. Chaosia was actually still walking around perfectly in those damn heeled boots of hers, though her hips had taken on a much more pronounced sway as the more alcohol she consumed. But as he watched her movements now, seeing the almost boneless grace she moved with when she was lining up a shot, he knew it was just because she was relaxed. She turned, winking at him as she shot and sunk the last of their balls, passing the cue to Sway to take the eight ball. She couldn't keep doing that. Chaosia stood, stretching before turning to Tumbler and Kip, who were deep in a game of Waterfall. \"I'm going to get a coke. Anyone else want anything?\" Both shook their heads, neither dropping their beers to answer for fear of having to drink the nasty shot they'd picked for the loser. She shook her head, going towards the main bar. She had to admit that this was fun. And she had needed it. She was a bit surprised when Mirror had showed up and bought her first round as an apology for leaving her to clean up his mess but she'd appreciated the gesture. It was nice that he'd at least tried. And the fruity blueberry shot had been interesting to try. She smirked, remembering the looks on their faces when she had the bartender line up the set of Four Horsemen shots for them to try. Mirror and Tumbler had taken in to the head with as much bravado as they could muster, only to end up sputtering and coughing. Kip, however, had eased it down with her and been fairly unfazed by the four burning liquors traveling down his throat. Actually, watery eyes and a week smile were all he'd given her before shooting off to get Memphis, Donnie and Atley with the same trick. She chuckled, working her way through the now crowded dance floor of the Anchor towards the main bar. The Old School hadn't faired any better than he had up against her and her father's favorite celebratory shot. It was one of the first things she'd ever had when he defected from England and he'd made sure to instill a love of it in all of his children and stepchildren. She was definitely enjoying herself now that she'd had three and the bottles she and Sway had cleared in the time they'd been here. And even now, with one of the reasons she'd needed tonight so badly she was still having fun . . . just in a different way. She'd laughed and drank and even danced (though just with Sway because none of the gathered crew seemed to possess a matching set of feet) until Sphinx had walked through the doors. That's when Sway had come up with the idea to play pool, seeing as in they could all enjoy the game . . . and the ribbing that went with it. She and Sway had cleaned Tumbler and Kip out completely, though she planned to give them their money back tomorrow at the shop. And she would be remise to deny the fact that the way the stoic boost kept forcing his eyes back to Atley in whatever one sided conversation the other man was rambling on about wasn't a private thrill. She'd seen the way he kept looking at her back when she was shooting and how he kept glaring at Tumbler for voice his own appreciation of her jeans . . . and it was nice to know that once he had some (okay almost as much alcohol as her Sway) in him that he could loosen up enough to enjoy the group's company. But now, as she made her way away from said group, of all the eyes following her she knew his weren't anymore. Apparently Sphinx was of the out of sight out of mind school of thought. As she stepped up to the bar, she reminded herself that she needed to get a plain Coke . . . because while she wasn't anywhere near wasted she did have to drive back in the next few hours. Last call was at 2 am and the bar closed up at 3, which still gave her almost three hours to let the alcohol work out of hers system. She nodded to herself, set in her decision and ordered. The tender handed her the large, cool glass and she smiled, dropping him a bill and turning to leave when she collided with a living wall. She caught herself, looking up to see a dark unfamiliar and leering face looking down at hers. She had no idea who he was but he was definitely giving off the creepy vibe in crashing waves. She nodded, going to step around him and rejoin her friends only to be stopped by strong hands on her hips, holding her in place. Chaos fought to control her flaring temper as the dark stranger leered down at her, smirking enough for her to see the golden glint to his teeth. \"Hey Baby . Why don't you come with me?\" She choked back the growl threatening to spill forth from her lips and put on her best come hither smile. She knew that the gloss and the make-up would aide her in what she was about to do if she had to. \"Sorry, Stud. But I'm taken . . . and I have to get back so if you'll excuse me-\" A sharp cold point being pressed into her exposed back cut off the rest of her sentence and she mentally groaned. Seriously? What was with these idiots in Long Beach and trying to pick fights every five damn seconds? Okay, so she'd picked the first one but still . . . She glared at him as he spoke, lips spreading into a wide white and gold smile that seemed bright against the dark color of his skin, digging the blade ever so slightly into her skin. \"Sorry baby but I have to insist . See, my new boss has a message for your little friends over there . . . and you get to be the message board.\" Oh dear Lord . . . Sphinx looked up, checking the moving crowd for Chaosia. Again. She'd been gone for far longer than she should've been . . . He turned, looking to Atley. The wiry boost was scanning the now practically vibrating crowd as well while the others were oblivious. Atley turned, met his gaze and nodded before pushing away from his seat in sync with Sphinx. The shorter boost turned to Memphis to explain while Sphinx started towards the sea of bodies in his way. \"We're going to check on Chaosia . . . She's been gone a while.\" Memphis nodded when a loud crack and a crash brought the entire crew's attention to the dance floor and the main bar area. Kip and Tumbler were up and moving, the latter grabbing Sphinx by the arm and pulling him towards the now apparent sounds of a ruckus. What was it with people and dragging him tonight? He was sure he didn't have a sign that said \"Please manhandle me I enjoy it\" on his chest that last time he'd checked. He and Tumbler cleared through the sea of dancers-turned-on-lookers, Atley and the Raines brother right on their heels. When Sphinx finally knocked his way into open space, he was amazed at what was waiting on him. He'd heard Tumbler and Kip's retelling of the girl in action but he honestly had to see it to believe it. Chaosia stood there, back facing him with a crumpled groaning and bleeding man at her booted feet. Another man was off to the side, slumped beneath an overturned table with what looked like half a glass sticking out of his face and neck. Upon closer inspection, the glassed man turned out to be one of Johnny B's main runners . . . or what was left of him anyway. Tumbler checked him, nodding to Sphinx. \"He's okay. Bloody and dazed but okay. We need to get her out of here though.\" Sphinx nodded, coming up behind Chaos and pacing a hand on the small of her back. The next thing he knew, he had her wrist clasped tightly in his hand as she turned and almost caught him the neck with a vicious jab. He watched as the hard glint to her eyes melted into shock and what he thought was remorse. A silver glint from her hand brought his eyes to her still contained fist. Dear Lord where had she gotten that? The glittering silver blade she was holding hadn't even registered when he'd caught her fist mere centimeters from his neck. Jesus . . . she had been out for blood. What the hell had happened up here? The crumpled man at her feet groaned, causing her to turn and face him. Allowing Sphinx a nice look at the long angry gash pouring blood down her back. No wonder she'd almost slashed him. She'd been sliced and diced and he had just touched the damn oozing wound. Lord he was lucky he had a damn head. His hand came back to the wound, using the bottom of her now sliced shirt to apply pressure to the steadily bleeding wound as he herded her away from her victim. Atley nodded to him, turning to retrieve the others. \"That needs attention. We going to the Doc's?\" Chaos looked up, seeing the blood on the blade for the first time and paled. She shook her head, turning to Sphinx. \"No hospitals or doctors. We can't have a corresponding report for when the cops get him. Have 'em come to my house. I have a kit and one of you can clean it and wrap it.\" Sphinx nodded, understanding and hating the logic behind her reasoning. If the cops did respond to the incident then she couldn't have the very injury the man was sure to report inflicting on record. Or it would bring them right down around them. And though they'd done nothing wrong here, it would put a damper on their other more illegal business for a while. He sighed, gently leading Chaos towards the door. So much for keeping his distance . . . Tumbler followed him to her car, keeping a close eye on the cars coming and going from the Anchor parking lot. Sphinx knew what the boy was looking for and though he doubted that the man would make an appearance, Johnny B was all they needed right now. Sphinx pushed Chaos into the passenger side of the Saleen and took the keys from her, ignoring her grumbling about her lost coat and the blood getting on her seats. They were leather and they would come clean. Even if he had to clean them to shut her up about it. He tossed Tumbler the keys to his Malibu, knowing that the boy would take care of it as he followed them to Chaosia's house. He would be talking Kip through the directions once they got to her place so the others could meet them there. It was an odd way of doing it but it would work for the time being. Atley came out, Chaosia's coat in hand, and joined them. \"I'm riding with Tumbler to follow now. That way two sets of eyes can give better directions. Memphis and Kip are coming now while Sway and Donnie deal with the cops with Mirror and Toby. None of them have rap sheets you know?\" Sphinx nodded, knowing that as soon as a cop heard that a Raines might have been involved then Castlebeck would be breathing down their throats. Again. This was the best course of action. He took Chaosia's coat, tossing it to her and getting in the Saleen, bringing the engine to life. Memphis and Kip came out of the Anchor, making their way to Eleanor as Tumbler and Atley departed to the Malibu. Sphinx sighed, watching Tumbler crawl behind his baby blue's wheel. He knew the boy would take care of it but he still hated to see anyone else touch her. He was rather picky about who dealt with his things. He turned to Chaos, who was sitting up so she would bleed on the seats too badly. She gave him a tight smile as she resituated herself and turned on the air conditioning. \"Guess I got carried away huh?\" Sphinx nodded, pulling out of the lot and onto the road, heading towards Bixby Knolls. As they rode, he glanced at her from the corner of his eye. She was paled and sweating but seemed fine. She wasn't wincing or crying. Hell she didn't even seem that hurt . . . but he couldn't shake the feeling that maybe she did need to see a doc. How the hell had she gotten into a fight that quickly? Or gotten cut for that matter? Only one way to find out . . . \"How did you get cut then?\" Chaos jerked back into awareness as the sound of his voice broke the silence. She looked at him, trying to figure out whether or not to tell him . . . then decided she needed to. The asshole had been intent to make her a message for his crew so why not let them know? \"The guy popped up behind me when I was at the bar. I turned and he was there. Tried to get around him and he stopped me, putting his hands on my hips while he ran his mouth. I was telling him I wasn't interested when I felt the blade to my back. He said I didn't have a choice and I was going to be a message to your crew from his new boss. Whatever the fuck that means . . .\" She shrugged, wincing as the movement pulled the cut on her back. She knew it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Probably. But it would need to be cleaned and dressed so she could sleep this night off. And it was all going so well before the jackass with the knife too. She looked out the window, noticing that they were in her neighborhood. She sighed, chancing a glance at Sphinx. His hands were clutching the steering wheel so tightly that his knuckles were white. And his jaw was set so hard that she knew it had to be painful. She groaned, causing him to look at her quickly as he made the turn to her road. Great now he thinks you can't take care of yourself, genius. Way to go. . . . She gave him a deadpan look as he pulled into her driveway, waiting for Tumbler to catch up before pressing the automatic entry button for the garage. \"I'm fine you know. Just moved wrong. No need to have kittens in my front seat. They're bloody enough as it is without your help.\" He growled at her, turning to level a very dark glare as the Malibu pulled in behind them. As Tumbler parked beside her Cayenne she looked at her house. \"I hope they don't treat me differently because they see my house . . . but I guess I can't blame them if they do. Almost everybody does.\" She knew he was looking at her but she didn't pay him any attention as she reached up and hit the button on the console. The white garage doors opened and he pulled the Saleen into its place. As soon as the car was parked, Chaosia was out an going to the side door into the house. She knew she hadn't brought Sphinx through the sunroom and the back patio area before but she really hadn't seen the need. She sighed, pulling her keys out of her jacket pocket and opening the door. Atley and Tumbler were waving Memphis and Kip into the garage, all four in different stages of car-worship before realizing that the house was open. Memphis walked around the cars and towards the door, holding it open for her to go through. She smiled at him, holding her jacket closer as she walked into the huge sunroom. The walls were painted the same color as her kitchen and the floor was the same tile. The wall facing her backyard was made completely of windows, showing off the lighted in-ground pool set in the cobblestone patio. The grill area could be seen off to the side with the outdoor sofas and tables near it. She flipped a switch, lighting the room and the yard at once. The Tuscan styled lights shed the room in warm golden light as the lights outside allowed the assembled crew to see the huge yard and pool area, as well as her gardens. She sighed; deliberately trying to ignore Kip's awed look and Tumbler's disbelief. \"You live here and work for Otto ?\" She nodded, walking briskly through the sunroom towards the doorway to the kitchen. If she could get in there and get someone to look at this then she could take a shower and go to damn bed already. Her back was starting to ache and she knew she needed to work quickly before the nerve endings woke up from their shock. Sphinx followed behind her, Atley and Memphis catching up as she flipped the switch and bathed her kitchen in the same golden light as the sunroom. Kip walked through, still amazed. \"Man, can I come live with you? I swear I'll help you cook and clean if you say yes.\" Chaos looked at him. She knew that he was kidding but tonight was not the time or place for this crap. This is why she hated bringing people home with her. Sphinx glared at both of the younger boosts, silencing whatever was about to come out of Tumbler's lips as she hissed and caught the counter. Her back was awake and it was pissed. Atley came around, looking at the wound and shaking his head. \"This is deep darling. A doc should be doing this . . .\" She shook her head, pulling herself up and onto the curved countertop. \" NO doctor and no hospitals. There's a first aid kit in my master bathroom upstairs.\" Sphinx nodded, disappearing through the den and up the steps with Memphis in tow. She sighed, giving Atley a weak smile as Kip and Tumbler pulled up barstools. \"So? You guys really know how to show a girl a good time. But next time, I get to pick the place. Deal ?\" Memphis was awed by the house. He'd heard from Otto that Chaosia's dad was some sort of genius when it came to turning his boosting profits into a legal fortune but he'd never have guessed the man would've put his daughter up like this . He watched Sphinx work his way down the hallway and towards the last doorway like he knew where he was going. Huh. How would he know where her bedroom was? Sphinx opened the door and Memphis had an epiphany. Chaosia wasn't just some spoiled daddy's girl who wanted a change of pace. Thought it was increasingly apparent her family was loaded to the gills, Chaosia still wanted to work. And go to school. He had to admire that. Hell, he even partially understood it. Before his old man had died, he'd learned the hard way that having a father who owned his own business wasn't always a walk in the park. Oh sure, he'd had his pick of cars until the day his dad had dropped dead but the stigma that went with being from a 'well off' family had bugged the shit out of him. Everyone had always treated him differently. Like getting good with him was an easy way into his dad's wallet or a new car for less. He'd actually made more friends (true friends that is) after he and his family had lost everything and he'd had to scrimp and scrape to make something out of himself. That's how he knew the look Chaos had given Tumbler and Kip. It was one he'd given his old friends a million times when they'd begged to borrow whatever car his dad had brought home. He sighed, going into the large and almost too extravagant bathroom. The whole room was covered in white and turquoise iridescent tiles with a separate five headed shower and huge bathtub. The other side was a large vanity and another door that he'd bet lead to the actual toilet. The other door was open and he could see Sphinx moving through the huge linen closet to find the kit. He fleetingly wondered if he and his family would've ever been set up like this if his old man had lived, then quickly dismissed the thought. He missed his father and would give almost anything to have him back. But not because him being here could've set them up like this. He wanted him back because he missed him. And he so desperately wanted his brother to have the same relationship he'd forged with the man in the last few years of his life. After puberty and testosterone had run its course and he and his father could stand to be in the same room that is. Sphinx emerged from the linen closet, kit in hand, with a darker expression than usual on his face. Could it be that? No. There was no way in hell that the Sphinx was worried about the pretty little blonde downstairs . . . was there? He would definitely have to keep a close eye on this. He followed Sphinx back out of the room and towards the kitchen, just then noticing the quickness of his steps and the determination in his gait. As they cleared the steps, Memphis had to take them two at a time to keep up with the dark giant . . . which only fueled his suspicions. As they walked back in the kitchen, Memphis noticed Sphinx's shoulders set. He smirked when he saw why. Tumbler was sitting right beside Chaos on one of the barstools, holding her hand in his as he went on and on about some random event that he Mirror and Kip had undertaken a few years ago. Chaos was smiling, and though it was strained, it was real . She looked up and saw them and the smile brightened. Memphis nodded, watching as the Sphinx nodded to the girl and glared at his brother and his best friend. Well, well , well . Hell was freezing beneath his feet because Sphinx was concerned about Chaos. Memphis motioned to Kip and Tumbler to step back, intent on watching this little scene unfold. If what he thought was happen was indeed happening then his brother and Tumbler needed to be as far from it as possible. Or they might just end up on Sphinx's slab at the morgue for standing in the way of getting something Memphis was sure the stoic boost didn't even know he wanted yet. \"C'mon guys, let's give her some space until Donnie gets here.\" Atley nodded, shooting the two a glare that had even Memphis wanting to retreat. Damn it, it was easy to forget that for all of Atley's easy smiles and jokes that the man had antifreeze in his veins rather than blood when he wanted to. Chaos smiled, patting Tumbler's hand before nodding. \"Go ahead. It'll be cool. My back has gone back to sleep so I'm cool until we start sewing it together.\" Tumbler nodded, standing and going with Kip to stand with Memphis. Chaos looked over as Kip and Tumbler chatted, mouthing a silent 'thank you' to Memphis as Sphinx came to stand almost directly in front of her. Memphis nodded, winking before shrugging when she giggled, causing Sphinx and Atley to look at him questioningly with Kip and Tumbler. She smiled at him, reaching out to take the kit from Sphinx. \"Hey guys, there's a TV in the next room. Go ahead and find something to watch. Donnie and Sway will be here soon with Mirror and Toby.\" Memphis nodded, grabbing the two other boosts and dragging them with him. Atley walked around, going with him, leaving Chaos and Sphinx alone together in the kitchen. As they walked into the den, Kip and Tumbler practically jumped on the TV, trying to decide on a channel. Atley and Memphis sat on the curved sofa, watching the two argue like kids over what to watch. After a few minutes, Atley turned to him, smirking. \"Think he realizes it yet ?\" Memphis chuckled, shaking his head. \"Nope. But Sway mentioned that she'd noticed Chaos might be a little sweet on him. Apparently she blushes every time he's near after the whole smurf bath incident so that's some stellar female sign of interest.\" Atley nodded, eyes going back to the still arguing 'kids' in front of them. \"She asked about him when we went to eat the yesterday evening. I told her he was just odd and liked his privacy so when he came to stay with her today not to be offended if he didn't act interested like the rest of us.\" Memphis nodded, wincing as Tumbler socked Kip for stealing the remote. \"So . . . About six weeks before they're bumping uglies?\" Atley laughed, drawing Kip and Tumbler's attention to them. \"I give it less than that , Raines. Especially with how he was looking at her in there.\" Both nodded then laughed. Their little bitty Sphinx had a crush. God in heaven help him.[Chapter 10] Scars & Souvenirs Sphinx watched intently as Donnie pulled what for all intents and purposes appeared to be a mattress needle through Chaosia's back for what (he hoped anyway) was to be the last time. The girl had been a great sport about it, lying down on her counter and letting him poke and prod and peroxide the hell out of the damn thing without even a squeak of protest. What bothered him though were the other scars on her back. Apparently he'd been wrong about her never having seen scars like his or the other boosts . . . because every time she looked in the mirror she saw them. Her back was riddled with them. And it bothered him that he cared what had happened to her to cause them. He turned, watching Sway as she talked to Chaos, telling bad joke after bad joke to keep the girl awake and laughing. As soon as she'd come in, Sway had sent everyone but Donnie and him out, banishing Toby and Mirror to Chaosia's den with the others to wait while Donnie sewed her back together. She'd then taken it upon herself to keep the girl occupied while Donnie fixed her up. \"Hey Chaos?\" The girl looked up at Sway, drawing Sphinx's attention. Her eyes bothered him. They were sharp and alert . . . but he could practically see her distancing herself from the pain in her back. And it bothered him that it bothered him enough to notice. \"Yeah Sway?\" \"Why does a chicken coop only have two doors?\" Chaos raised a brow at her before shaking her head. \"I know I'm going to regret it . . . but I'll bite. Why, Sway?\" The blonde boost grinned, leaning in to share her last horrible joke. \"Because if it had four, then it'd be a sedan. Get it?\" Chaos was laughing as Donnie snipped the last suture, looking at Sway like she was crazy. \"Okay baby girl. You're all set. These need to stay like this for at least two weeks. Then I can take them out.\" Chaos nodded standing and turning her head as much as she could to see. When she grimaced at the pull of the fresh sutures, she sighed. Finally she gave up and walked down the hall, holding her shirt in place as she disappeared behind a door. A few seconds later she was back and looked very surprised. \"Damn Donnie, you did a good job. These look professional .\" Donnie nodded, smirking proudly as he washed her blood off his hands. Sway was already packing up what was left of Chaosia's first aid kit and tidying up her massive kitchen while Donnie kept the conversation ball rolling. \"They should. My first wife was an EMT and taught me everything she knew about sewing things back together . . . before she decided she hated me, that is. So, what happened to your back? Those other scars are pretty old but they definitely needed some sort of medical treatment.\" She shrugged, wincing when it pulled her sutures for the second time. Sphinx felt his own back tense as she moved to work out the tightness. She had definitely done this enough to not be a bawling mess in the corner. Hell she seemed like a seasoned pro at keeping herself distracted from the pain . . . Sphinx forced himself to listen. He wanted to know what had happened to make her like this. \"Car wreck when I was seventeen. Long story short I rolled a very fine GT 350 Mustang and lived to bitch and whine about it. Look, let me get changed and we can all sit down and do whatever.\" Donnie nodded and smiled, going with Sway going to separate the very loud argument that was brewing in the den. Apparently, the boys had not only found the TV but the DVDs as well . . . and they were still arguing over who was going to do what. Chaos sighed and shook her head turning to leave and go upstairs. The weight of everything seemed to settle on her with every step . . . Sphinx waited until she passed through the den and started after her. He knew it was stupid and that no one knew where she lived but the thought of leaving her alone right now was just . . . wrong. He quietly went up the stairs, none of the others noticing as they tried to separate Mirror and Tumbler, who had been thumb wrestling and decided to just graduate to plain ol' regular wrestling instead. The winner got to pick the next movie. He sighed, shaking his head as he went to her bedroom. Those boys were a mess . He opened the door, just in time to see Chaos coming out of her bathroom in a pair of lacey white panties and loose heather blue University of California tee shirt. She stopped, looking all the world like a deer in headlights until she recognized him and relaxed slightly. She walked by him, grabbing a pair of grey sweatpants from her closet and putting them on slowly, trying not to pull her back. Once she was dressed, she crossed back to her bed and sat down, patting the spot beside her as she had earlier. He sat down willingly this time, knowing she didn't need to pull him if he refused. And that she probably would anyway. She sat there, looking at her hands in her lap and Sphinx could see her mind working even though her face was controlled and blank. If he wasn't so good at reading others he would have thought she had just shut down and didn't care about anything. She had a marvelous poker face. Finally, she looked up at him with weary and heavy eyes and shrugged. But he could see her pulling back even as she sat beside him. He didn't know why but it left him feeling cold to watch her emotionally distance herself from him. Even if it was by proxy. \"I really just want to go to bed, you know? I don't want to try and answer all of those questions because I don't have them. Can't you just go down there and glare at them until they leave?\" He quirked a brow at her, trying to ignore the warring parts of his mind. Part wanted to do nothing more than that and come back up to just let her be in the peace she so obviously needed and wanted. But the other, smaller part was slightly . . . offended that she saw him like that. Someone terrifying to scare the others away and that could easily be . . . dismissed because he didn't normally seek out other people's company. He decided to let the rational side speak and tucked the injured animal back into his subconscious. He shouldn't be hurt by what she said or how she was acting now. When had she become so distant ? \"And what am I supposed to do when they're gone then? You'd have to come down to lock up after me.\" She blushed, shrugging and wincing. \"I've got to quit doing that. Man, Uncle Otto is going to shit his heart if he sees me act like it hurts. I'm just glad Dad won't find out until later. Much later.\" She sighed, pushing her hair out of her face. \"Thank you . . . . For driving me back. And for dealing with my Dad earlier. I promise not to do that to you again. I should've known he'd be all weird because there was a guy here.\" He nodded, watching as she stood and went to go downstairs but stopped in the doorway. She looked back at him as he stood and came to stand behind her, obviously trying to word whatever she was about to say next. \"I just wanted you to know I appreciate it . . . \" He nodded, following her as she made her way downstairs and to the group. As they got downstairs, she sat with Sway and Donnie. She answered whatever she could and listened to all of their theories. But she didn't look to him like she had before when she was talking at the diner. She didn't glance at him and nod or smile when the others were being silly like she had at the bar. And she didn't shy away from Tumbler and Kip when they plopped down in front of her and started with their goofiness like she had at the garage. It should have made him feel better that she was giving him his much coveted space. It should have been a good thing that she seemed to have decided to go ahead and integrate herself even further within the younger sect of their crew. But it wasn't . For the life of him, he couldn't understand why the very sight of her laughing at Tumbler and pinching Toby's cheeks when he showed her his own battle scar had him seeing red. Part of him wanted to shed his own shirt and join in when the others started showing their own. He was sure that the knife scars on his side and the old bullet wounds down the right side of his back would top Kip's car-door-scarred fingers and Tumbler's burned knees . . . but he refrained. So what if she was looking at them the way she should be looking at him, like she had earlier . . . He should've been happy that he was apparently free of her attention. It's what he'd been after since he'd caught himself thinking of her that first night. But he wasn't. And what confused him the most is the fact that it didn't bother him to admit that maybe being the focus of her attention hadn't been so bad after all. After the others had all gone, Sway volunteered to stay the night with her. Normally, Chaos would've refused the invitation because she didn't want anyone pitying her or thinking she needed the help . . . but tonight she just couldn't find the will to say no. Which is how the two of them ended up in her huge bed, eating popcorn and watching the TV on the ceiling . . . who knew Sway was a Bones fan too? \"I swear they should just go ahead and get together . . . they are so into each other.\" Chaos smirked, popping a few pieces of popcorn in her mouth nodding lazily. \"Yep. I mean seriously. Who tells him no? I would do Seeley Booth in a heart beat.\" Sway chuckled, agreeing. \"Half a heartbeat, darling. That man is fine.\" Sway glanced over at her, propping herself up on an elbow as she looked at Chaos. \"Speaking of doing people in heartbeats . . . what's up with the way Sphinx was all hovering tonight?\" Chaos knew she was blushing. When she turned to look at Sway, the older girl waggled her brows at her while smirking devilishly. \"Have you two been polishing the desk at work?\" Chaosia's blush increased until it felt like her face was on fire. She groaned, rolling and covering her head with a pillow. Sway laughed, nudging her gently enough to not hurt her back. \"OH MY GOD! You have been, haven't you? Oh, you naughty girl! That's it. Tell me everything. I've always wondered if that man was as fierce in bed as he is on the job.\" Chaosia pulled the pillow down enough to glare at the grinning Cheshire cat that had replaced Sway. She groaned, rolling to mirror Sway's position in the bed. \"No. We haven't-it's not like that. He was my babysitter today and I think it just bothered him that I got hurt on his watch . . . Because trust me, that man barely knows I exist.\" Sway sobered, raising a brow at her. \"But you want him to?\" Chaos shrugged her shoulders. It barely hurt now to move them . . . \"I don't know. I think he's attractive and I know that there could be chemistry there . . . but . . .\" \"But?\" Sway knew the second Chaosia looked up at her that all of the bravado and attitude the girl possessed was gone for the night. She was getting to see a side of this kid that she doubted anyone rarely glimpsed. Her eyes were watery and looked so sad as she just shrugged again. Whatever was going on in the girl's head was deep enough to swallow all of her normal personality and leave this behind . . . This girl needed a friend. Not drinking buddies or goofing around with the guys . . . a true friend to talk to. To sound off to and be raw with. Sway lay there, watching her as she tried to pull herself back together enough to move forward. How had it been since she'd had someone to do that with? They both needed to talk. She nodded to Chaos to continue and listened. \"I just don't know . . .\" For the rest of the night, well into the morning, the two talked about their pasts and the present. Sway learned about Marcello and Yvonne and Chaosia learned about Memphis leaving for so long. As the first rays of sun peaked through the windows, Sway felt herself lighten as the room did. It felt nice to tell someone about this that wasn't there. To have an honest objective opinion. . . and she could tell Chaos felt the same. She could also tell that for all her indecisiveness where the stoic boost was concerned, Chaosia did have a soft spot for the Sphinx . . . she just hoped that the man wouldn't break the already fragile girl if anything came of it. Finally after hours of talking and gossiping, Chaosia sat up and stretched. \"Okay, I am officially hungry enough to eat a bear. Want to borrow some sweats and hit an IHOP? My treat.\" Sway nodded, following Chaosia to the closet and accepting the black sweat pants and the grey long sleeved tee shirt. As Chaos dove into the bathroom to change into a better pair of grey sweats, Sway looked around her closet. The girl had more clothes than a department store, with bags of what appeared to be matched outfits in the very back. When Chaos came back and saw what Sway was looking at, she laughed. \"Those are my emergency Mom and Social clothes. My best friend Paul helped me match them with everything and keep them ready for surprise visits. I know it seems odd but it keeps me sane when they're on their way.\" Sway nodded, seeing the logic as she looked Chaosia over. The darker grey sweats were pushed to her knees, showing off her legs and flip flopped feet while the black tank top was just loose enough to not stick to the bandages she could see peaking from beneath the material of the shirt. The black zip up hoodie she held in her hand would hide the rest while they were out. No need to make anyone suspicious. Chaos handed Sway a dark green track jacket to put on over her shirt and motioned to the various pairs of flip flops lining the floor of the closet. \"Pick a pair. I have plenty.\" Sway chuckled, grabbing a black pair before pulling them and the jacket on. She followed Chaos downstairs to the garage, handing her the keys to the Porsche before locking the door. As they made their way through the garage, Sway took her time perusing the cars and admiring them before following Chaos out and to the Cayenne. As she cranked the engine, she could see why Chaos had chosen this as her car. It was definitely a sleeper . . . and nice on the inside. She turned to her accomplice. This was going to be fun. As much as she hated to admit it, she'd missed having a female friend to talk and gossip with. To go and just be girly with and not have to be the hard ass boost all of the time. \"Breakfast, Ms. Guadimus?\" Chaos nodded, pulling her hair up and into a ponytail, careful of the stitches on her back. She turned on the radio, then hit the button to close the garage door. \"Breakfast, Ms. Wayland.\" Chaos and Sway sat at a small booth, enough plates between them to feed an army. But it didn't matter. This was comfort food. Every pancake, egg, toast and crepe was for some misdoing and wrong deed the two had experienced. And every bite just took a little bit of the bitterness talking about them had left in its wake away. Or that's what they were going to go with should anyone ask. Honestly, they were starved from the excitement last night and not sleeping . . . so all of the food would help force them into the coma they needed to recharge . . . plus those cream stuffed strawberry French toast were too good to pass up. Chaos laughed as Sway smirked at their poor waiter, flirting shamelessly as the boy stuttered and fumbled. She wasn't thrilled to have been sliced and diced, but she was glad to have found a friend in the older girl. Sure Tumbler and the others counted . . . but having Sway was as good as having Paul. Not any better per say, just different. As they split the last bit of French toast, Sway started a rather interesting conversation. \"So . . . you dig the Sphinx, right?\" Chaos choked, forcing herself to swallow the bite lodged in her throat. She gulped down half of her coke before looking at Sway like she was crazy. Finally, she shrugged and gave in. No use in lying now. \"I like him a little . . . not that'll do me any good. He is firmly in denial of my very existence.\" Sway shrugged, nonplussed. \"So? We make him aware of your existence.\" Chaosia raised a brow, intrigued. \"How?\" Sway smirked, taking a huge bite of the sirloin tip and eggs plate. \"You ignore him.\" As Chaos went to speak, Sway cut her off, using her fork to wave at her friend as she swallowed her own bite. \"Look, you've probably already talked to him once, right?\" She nodded, leaning back to listen. \"And it probably didn't go so well. He's hard headed, just like every other man out there. More so because he won't say three words unless we pry them out of him with a crowbar.\" Chaos opened her mouth to inform Sway that Sphinx had talked with her, carried on a conversation, however small, and had even talked with her father . . . but chose to stay quiet. If he didn't want to talk to them, then he had a reason. Besides, it was a thrill that he'd talked to her and not the others. She could keep that a secret. \"Yeah, it wasn't exactly a huge hit. So why do I ignore him?\" Sway's smirk spread into a wicked little grin as she leaned forward conspiratorially. Chaos leaned in as well, though she felt ridiculous for doing so. \"I saw the way he kept sneaking glances at you at the bar . . . and while we were patching you up honey. He's noticed you . . . but the fact that you've noticed him back keeps him in his arena. He knows, on some level you're at least interested in him some way. And as long as you show that he isn't going to do much. There's no point.\" She leaned back, taking a drink of her tea. \"But if you start casually ignoring him . . . maybe spending time with other people . . . I'm sure the big lug will seek you out eventually. You'll just need to be patient. Can you do that?\" Chaos sat there, evaluating the option and had to admit she saw the merit of it. Finally, she nodded. \"Yeah, I can do that.\" Sway nodded, happy to have helped. As the waiter brought the check, she mentioned, \"You could also start to dress a little more . . . adult.\" Chaosia gaped at her. \"I do dress like an adult!\" Sway waved her off again, giving her a deadpan look. \"No honey, you dress like a college girl. Which isn't bad . . . but every once in a while, throw in something that no one is expecting. Nothing trashy or in poor taste. Just enough to draw attention. The right kind of attention . . . Get me?\" She nodded, laying her head on the table. She would go along with Sway's plan . . . for all the good it would probably do her. She just hoped he didn't think she was an idiot after this was all said and done.[Chapter 11] The Confusion of the Sphinx & The Wrath of Atley Jackson Chaosia sat on one of the huge sofas on her patio, drinking hot tea while she watched the others dash around and toss each other in the pool. She sighed, shaking her head with a smile on her face. Junie and Otto had told her to take time off until the stiches were out, which was annoying but she'd done it. Especially after her Aunt's lecture about letting other people help her and not trying to be a 'bad ass all the damn time'. She sighed again, taking a sip of her tea. She'd be able to go back next weekend and she was thrilled but for now . . . the younger crew had taken to at least one of them staying with her almost constantly. And instead of aggravating her to no end like before they were actually helping and being almost . . . normal. Once the initial comments about the size and surprise of the house (and cars) being hers were out of the way, the guys acted like nothing had changed in the five days since she'd been sliced and diced. If anything the younger crew had started acting more like she was one of them than they had before. Maybe letting them know about her house wasn't so bad after all. Kip and Tumbler had offered to help her rearrange the furniture in the bedrooms she had been working on prior to her injury and set up the almost empty sunroom, which she had been thankful for. She hadn't been relishing moving in the huge three piece sea grass and abaca sofas she'd bought from Pottery Barn by herself . . . or the huge driftwood table her mother had found at a beach shop. The two sea grass arm chairs would be have been the easiest but with the added help she had gotten the room set and was now completely done with her house. Mirror had come by to check on her the next day and insisted on properly setting up every stereo and entertainment system in her house, expertly hiding wires and speakers until the rooms were almost show worthy. Toby had even brought her to the bungalow style house that the younger crew shared, begging her to excuse the mess as they waded through the junk to get to from room to room on the grand tour. It was Freb that had caught her off guard though. He had shown up by himself with a huge tea sampler and a box of spearmint candy canes, a deep blush on his face as he extended them and a get well card he'd picked up. She'd laughed and thanked him, listening happily as she'd made them tea (a first for the clueless boost) as he explained that Junie had told him what to get her to make her feel better. Their company, plus Sway's constant calls from the office with this issue or that crisis had kept her pretty occupied . . . until Sway would start about how her not talking to Sphinx was actually working and she would have to find something to distract her again . . . . Like watching the idiots play in her pool. She smirked then winced as Tumbler and Kip dove on poor Mirror at the same time, splashing Toby and Freb in the process. That had to hurt . The six younger runners were spread out around her patio with the five of them in and out of the pool like kids. She had to admit that just watching them try and douse each other made her feel better . . . and almost forget that she hadn't seen hide nor hair of the elusive Sphinx since he'd helped bring her home nearly a week ago. But she couldn't really blame him that much. It was her own doing. She had decided to stick to her decision from breakfast with Sway and leave the man in peace, as hard as it was. While it was obvious he thought she was okay she could tell that was about the extent of it. And rather than set herself up for future heartbreak and hurt feelings she was going to limit their interaction and hope for the best. Paul had agreed with her when she'd called and spilled her guts to him about everything, telling her to listen to Sway until he could get there. And to not get cut up as some sort of crew message board again. Her dramatic and flamboyant best friend of practically forever had listened so intently that she could see him nodding and agreeing while he drank whatever he'd gotten his hands on through the phone. Paul had always been her sounding board and the voice of reason . . . and he was inbound in as soon as he could get the time off work. He was going to stay with her for a few days and try to help her sort all of this mess out . . . and she was hopeful that he could. Paul always seemed to know what she needed even when she didn't particularly want to acknowledge it. Like breaking up with Marcello . . . because a great body, good sex and an awesome car did not the perfect boyfriend make. She sighed, finding herself wishing that she could just for once be normal and have an honest to goodness relationship with someone who semi-understood her and wasn't a complete and utter douchebag. She'd secretly hoped that when she'd started to crush on Tall, Dark and Silent (as Paul had taken to calling him) that maybe he could be that . . . or at least a fun distraction for however long he was interested. . . But Paul had pointed out that while fun it wasn't fair to her and reiterated the whole \"not getting in too deep\" plan that was the back-up to Sway's \"ignore him till he's crazy about you\" plan. Oh she wasn't going to be mean or rude but if he wanted to see her then he would have to seek her out. She had never chased after anyone like a love sick pup and she sure as hell wasn't starting now. Besides . . . it was probably better this way anyway. A squawk brought her attention back to the pool and she had to laugh. Toby and Freb had joined forces and were holding Kip over their heads, one with his arms and the other with his legs. They counted off together and tossed their defacto leader into the deep end of her pool, laughing as he came up sputtering and cursing. She sat her tea down, going to sit on the side of the pool and dip her feet. Everyone but Tumbler barely noticed her as they were too intent on ganging up on each other, the blond boost swimming over to her side and propping his arms on the rim of the pool. He smiled up at her and she had to admit her first thought of him was right. He was cute in a weird way . Just not her type . . . but definitely Mia and Paul's. She smiled down at him. \"Hey. Enjoying the pool?\" He nodded, wiping his hair back and out of his eyes. \"Yeah. This is great. Especially with how hot it is. So? When can you get in? I know this is killing you being part fish and all.\" She laughed, smacking him. He and Kip had seen her swimming trophies and diving certificates in her office and had labeled her 'part fish'. Which she really didn't mind as much as she pretended to. He'd die if he ever saw her other tattoo. \"Next weekend. And I'm thinking of having a pool party to celebrate. I start class next week too, you know.\" He nodded, his eyes suddenly distant. \"So you won't be around as much after that?\" She shrugged. \"Probably. I have classes from 8 am to 12 pm on Tuesday and Thursdays with a deep sea diving lab on Monday mornings and a full day of Aquarium interning on Fridays. So I'm going to be working with you guys on the weekends and after classes on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays. Wednesday's are going to be my free day.\" Tumbler nodded, seeming a little more at ease as he heard that she wasn't just disappearing. \"Your crash days.\" She laughed again, nodding. He looked up at her, almost nervously as he asked, \"Well, I usually go to the gym on Wednesdays with Kip and Toby . . . so if you wanted . . . we could all get together like every other week and eat lunch then go a few rounds in the ring. You're gonna need to keep that shoulder and back working to keep strength in it.\" She stopped; amazed that he'd offer that. Not he'd brave shopping or some stupid (to him anyway) marine function. He'd found something they both liked and was trying to be sweet about including her in part of the younger crew's daily routine. She smiled at him, nodding. \"Sure. But can we go somewhere other than the Quality Cup? They killed my food last time.\" He nodded, smiling brightly at her like she'd just agreed to something huge. Oh boy. This could go badly. But before she could even say anything he stopped her, surprising her again. \"Great. I'll show you Rosario's and when we're at the gym maybe you can show me some of your fighting styles . . .\" Chaos laughed, suddenly more at ease with the whole arrangement now than she had been when he'd started rambling. She'd misjudged him and she was kind of glad. He really was just a big flirt and being friendly, not trying to pick her up like she'd thought before . . . . well, not too heavily, anyway. She could deal with this. She patted his arm, winking. \"Don't worry Tumbles, I'll show you as much as I can. Any reason why?\" He nodded, going all dreamy eyed and Chaosia was choking back laughter. Now she had to know why he suddenly wanted to know more about the martial arts she'd learned. \"So I can add it into my arsenal, you know. Maybe do MMA fights or actually commit to a set style. Right now everything is just kind of what I've picked up on the streets and from the gym.\" She nodded, admiring the fact that he wanted to learn and was willing to take direction from a girl. More than a few of the contenders she'd pulverized during her teens had been too cocky to admit that she was a good fighter . . . even when she was feeding them their teeth. \"So . . . you want me to teach you about all of it just some. I could even try and enlist some outside help. Call in a few favors.\" He shrugged, looking slightly worried. \"As long as it isn't Kip or Mirror. They wouldn't let me live it down until I used it to win a match. Why?\" She smiled, waving his worries away. \"Nothing. Just thinking. Let's go help Toby dip Kip again. He seems to think that he's King Shit because he just threw poor Freb across the pool.\" Tumbler grinned, fighting and training forgotten as he pushed away from the wall. \"I'll grab his feet if you push him in.\" She grinned evilly, nodding and shedding the loose tee shirt that was covering her white bikini with the huge koi fish that went across the left breast and the left side of the low-rise bottoms. She knew that the top of her other tattoo, the two small glittering koi fish over her right pelvic bone was showing when Tumbler kept looking. She smiled. One was white with blue and turquoise spots while the other was a deep orange with the black and gold and they were arranged together like the Pisces symbol. Her sign. She nodded her head towards Kip, initiating the attack plan as Tumbler broke his gaze and started towards Kip's edge of the pool. A few seconds later, anyone near Chaosia's house could hear Kip screaming like a little girl when he hit the water. And the bouts of gut clenching laughter that followed. Atley was two seconds away from snapping at the Sphinx. Again . The normally indifferent and emotionally removed boost was currently brooding silently as he stalked around the office. Atley had already relieved Sway of filing and invoice duty over an hour before and he was on his way to going as crazy as she had been. And now he could see why. On top of the Sphinx practically hording himself away in here when he wasn't at the morgue there was no way that one person could possibly catch up the paperwork that the idiots Otto employed had fallen behind in without superhuman clerical skills. And to think Chaos had caught up almost seventeen years' worth of lag in just a matter of weeks. Atley looked up, watching Sphinx pace the length of the room again. He sighed. It was nice that the man actually cared about what happened to someone else but he was about to drive him bonkers with the pacing and the glares at every restorer who came in with some smart assed comment about Chaosia's absence. He'd already had to keep him from strangling Mitchell earlier . . . and that hadn't done anything other than leave both men in a sour mood . . . and Atley in pain from his leg. Finally, he decided enough was enough and started packing up to take the piles of paperwork to Chaosia's house. She might be restricted from the garage but he knew she'd probably appreciate the break from being bored. Or rescued from the Young bloods . His hands hit a yellow slip of paper and he saw red. This particular invoice was from Bob and it was laced with insults and slurs as well as 'corrections' that the girl needed to make. As far as he could tell the only corrections that needed to be made were on the worker's part and not Chaosia's. Actually, her diagnoses for the classic 72 Mustang was more accurate than what he was pitching. And more cost effective all the way around. The materials would be more reasonable and Otto would be justified in the project price she'd quoted because of man hours and boarding while the new fiberglass was being ordered and set. Then the painting could be discounted the ten percent she'd budgeted and still make a more than decent profit without raping the poor owner. Just who the hell did this idiot think he was? And to put on paper for the rest of the damned garage to see? Atley knew he'd overreacted when even the Sphinx looked at him like he was crazy but he couldn't help it. He'd been in this damned cubby hole for far too long and to find that! And to think that Chaos had been dealing with this shit and just hadn't said anything about it . . . He'd thrown a whole accordion file folder at the opposite wall, making the thing explode into a shower of yellow pink and white papers. To hell with it . He grabbed an empty cardboard file box and crammed the excess paperwork into it, picking up his keys and practically tearing out of the office towards his Corvette parked out back. As he stalked through the garage, he found Otto and detoured to him. \"I'm taking these to Chaosia to see if she can make heads or tails of them. And tomorrow we are all going to have a nice long chat about being professionals and doing our damned work right. And Bob had better be gone, Otto. Or so help me I'll kill him myself.\" Otto nodded, looking up from priming the Hemi Cuda in a daze. \"Sure thing, Jackson. Just breathe. \" He went to go back to work and stopped, pushing his glasses back up on his forehead. \"If the younger crew is there would you tell them that while I respect and appreciate their need to spend time with my goddaughter and what not that I need them here, and preferably all at once, for more than a few hours a day. Mirror and Toby are supposed to be helping me reprogram those damned chips for the Mercedes McLaren that we have coming in tomorrow and Kip is penned in to help Memphis with that Camaro body patch and restoration.\" Atley nodded, intrigued by the tidbit. So Kip's crew had been spending time with Chaos while she'd been out. Huh. Interesting. He turned and almost ran into the Sphinx. The man looked torn between being pissed and curious at the knowledge that Chaos had had company and been more than fine not being in his. Atley was just too stressed with all of this crap to be Sphinx's moral compass and voice of reason. He growled under his breath, watching Sphinx's mood darken even more as the knowledge he'd just gleaned seemed to sink in which was actually amazing. The stoic man's attitude had been steadily souring since the girl had been injured and this seemed to make it finally curdle . If it had been any other day he would have laughed. Mainly because he knew why Sphinx was so damned affected by the girl's odd withdrawal from him while the boost in question was completely clueless . . . but today was just going too badly to feel thrilled that his longtime friend was finally starting to act somewhat human. He sighed and listened as the stoic boost moved to follow him. Great now he got a long awkward and unbearably quiet car ride to the suburbia hell on top of the other stress of the day. Perfect.[Chapter 12] Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Sphinx was eerily quiet as Atley navigated the less known route to Chaosia's home and Atley was almost ready to crack. For the third time in two hours. He growled as they stopped at a light, shifting his gaze to land on his dark tempered friend as he stared out the window, seemingly nonplussed by his earlier outburst. But Atley knew him too well to believe that he wasn't upset and licking his wounds. The tell-tale vein throbbing above his left eye was easy to miss but Atley had seen it too many times over the years when Sphinx was trying to reign in his wicked temper. That, coupled with the occasional sound of his large knuckles cracking when he clenched and unclenched his fists would normally be enough for Atley to all but crow in victory for making him show some emotion . . . but today it had him just as on edge as the Sphinx. He sighed, pulling away from the line as the light turned green, taking the turn towards the suburb their newest crew member resided in. He knew he'd been a little too vocal in reprimanding his friend but damn it he'd had enough. Besides, it wasn't like what he'd told the man was untrue. And if he didn't want to face the fact that maybe he was the reason the girl had all but withdrawn from the old school (save for Sway) since her injury than that was just tough luck. He'd seen the way she'd been looking at him before the bar . . . and he saw how she'd acted when she came back for changing after Donnie patched her up. She'd started to give him a wider berth and leaning more towards the younger lot. He pulled into Chaosia's neighborhood, and watched Sphinx tense even more. He was on edge about being here but Atley wasn't going to deal with him like this until the girl returned to work. He sighed, remembering exactly what had transpired between them to even make the man get in his corvette. Sphinx followed him to the parking lot, stopping just in the doorway of the garage and looking at Atley expectantly. Atley growled, eye twitching as Sphinx shifted and nodded, his customary goodbye, before turning to go back to terrorizing the restores and haunting the office. Finally, Atley had enough. The snappy comments he'd grumbled earlier seemed like whispers of endearment compared to what was about to roll out of his mouth. He knew he was practically stomping on the man's toes but enough was enough. \" Well?\" Sphinx just stopped, looking at him with a brow quirked and an otherwise blank but sour face. That only served to piss Atley off even more. And he finally let loose. \" Damnation man. She fucking lived and she's fine. If you're so damned worried about her then go with me to drop this damned paperwork . . . If not then suck it up and quit damn glowering at everyone! We didn't make her stop talking to your emotional detached ass. You did.\" And with that he'd turned on his heel and stomped to his car, revving the engine and tossing the box of papers into the passenger seat. He waited, trying to slow his breathing and rest his now aching leg from the stomping fit . . . honestly surprised when the passenger door opened and the towering boost pushed the box into the back seat. He watched as Sphinx did his seatbelt and situated himself for the drive, never looking at Atley as he did so. HE knew he was pissed. But he was here and going. That in itself had to mean something. Right? Whatever he was expecting when they pulled into Chaosia's driveway was not what they got. He'd already gone round with Atley. Twice. And he was at the point that he didn't think he could be surprised any more than he had been when his normally relaxed companion turned his infamous cold nature towards him. He hadn't realized his bad mood had been so apparent . . . or that he had been aggravating Atley so badly. He just knew that he was rethinking his take on not allowing Chaos to occupy any part in his life . . . though what part he would let her have he wasn't sure yet. Honestly, he'd been so angry at himself for not being able to keep her from being hurt and not comforting her or being there or whatever it was bloody emotional idiots did for the women in their lives when something went awry that he hadn't really noticed his uncharacteristic actions. Until Atley had practically bitten his head of that is, telling him to suck it up and go if he was so worried. He sighed mentally. He'd planned on at least asking Chaos if she was okay when she'd come back to work but every time he went to the garage she was nowhere to be seen. So today when he'd come in to find not only Sway at her desk but Atley doing filing he'd let his paranoid and skeptical nature get the best of him. He'd honestly thought that the girl had just up and left or quit and that was that. And the pile of work and the other two boosts frustrations hadn't been anything but fuel for the fire and is anger had gotten the best of him. That and the fact that Sway had jumped off the phone as soon as she'd seen him . . . So when Atley snapped and set him to rights (as right as he got anyway) he knew he had to do something. He just didn't know what. What worried him was how he had let her get under his skin and he hadn't even noticed it. He'd been acting like a fretting ninny all week and was just now seeing that while he could be worried about the girl he shouldn't be as frantic as he'd been. This didn't bode well for him. Not at all. He sighed aloud this time, watching her house come to view as they got closer. And what was waiting there put a rock in his gut. Kip, Tumbler and Mirror's cars were all parked there, with Chaosia's Cayenne sitting off to the side on the grass. And from the looks of them, the cars had been there a while. When they got out of the car, they could hear the screams and laughs coming from the back yard. Sphinx looked down at Atley as he shrugged and lugged the huge box of paperwork with him towards the backyard. As they stepped through the privacy fence, Sphinx looked up and forgot how to breathe. Chaos was standing there at the edge of the pool with Toby, dressed in a barely there white bikini with a huge koi fish down the left side. Her hair was down and curling wildly around her back, the bangs held back by big aviator sunglasses as she laughed and leaned on the almost wheezing hacker. Freb and Tumbler were laughing in the pool as Kip shot out from under the water, sputtering and cursing with his arms fighting to catch purchase on his friends. Mirror was off to the side, nodding and adjusting his sunglasses. \"See that's what you get Raines. I told you she was the devil under that smile! And she definitely likes me better.\" Kip made his way to the shallow end, spitting water as he glared at Mirror. \"Only because she confuses you for an imp , Smurf.\" Mirror just shrugged, unfazed as he grinned. \"I'll be her imp any day, Gel Boy . Especially if it keeps me from looking like you.\" Chaos laughed, not noticing their new guests as she tried to stop the macho shit. \"Oh please. Neither of you are my type so just drop it. I like grown men not little boys .\" Tumbler laughed, slapping Kip on the back. \"Yeah dude. Like me , right Chaos?\" Sphinx felt his blood boil at the statement but he couldn't for the life of him figure out why it bothered him so badly. What did it matter if she fancied Tumbler over the others? He was still a far cry from the men Chaos claimed to prefer but if that was what she thought was a man . . . He watched as Chaos herself just rolled her eyes and went to the sofa area, returning with a coffee cup. She took a long sip and sighed before responding. \"Sorry Tumbles but even you aren't my cup of tea. I like 'em tall, dark and meaner than me. Besides, I could never date a man who spends more time on his hair than I do. Sorry.\" They all laughed and even Atley chuckled, looking his way almost expectantly. The added voice brought Chaos's eyes to them and she smiled, and though it didn't quite reach her eyes, waving them over. Sphinx looked anywhere but at her. He couldn't let his eyes wander over the tanned skin and abs and . . . . dear God was that another tattoo? Was she trying to be the death of him? \"Hey guys. Bring me some work to do?\" Atley nodded, turning his eyes to the pool, some of the playfulness draining away. Sphinx could tell he was pissed about being stuck in that office and then to find them here . . . They were in for it . . . eventually . \"Yeah. And Otto's summons for them. He wants all of you at the garage ASAP . You've got work to do so quit freeloading in Chaosia's pool.\" They groaned but started to get out, each going to their respective towels to dry off. As they filed into the sunroom to change, Toby came over and hugged Chaos blushing. She shook her head and ruffled his hair before shooing him back off with the others. Sphinx watched the boy go and could hear his friends' laughter when he opened the door to Chaosia's house. Since when were any of them on hugging terms ? And why did watching Chaos wrap her arms around him feel like a kick to the gut? Her laughter brought his attention to her as she moved from the pool side shaking her head, sitting at the outdoor coffee table. She was chatting away with Atley as she extended her hand for the box to be put in front of her. She started going through the paperwork, reading as she listened to Atley's description of the day and why he was there. She nodded, absently sorting the papers into the piles they needed to be in as she listened and commented. \"You're sweet to say something Atley, but Bob is just an idiot. I've dealt with it my way by making him bleed and that's enough for me. If he does anything else I'll deal with it. Fucked up back or not . Besides, Otto won't let him get out of hand and I can handle a little trash talk.\" Sphinx came to sit beside Atley on the other couch and watched amazed as she worked through the box quickly, seeming unfazed by the amount. She had a knack for organizing and it apparently went beyond her research and her cleaning abilities. Categorizing information and paperwork types seemed to go hand-in-hand for her. How had Otto survived this long without someone doing this? By time the boys emerged to leave, she had four different colored piles of paperwork that she was sitting neatly in the box, keeping like with like. Sphinx and Atley shared a look. Had she seriously just done what it had taken him and Sway hours to even try to accomplish in minutes? When Tumbler came over to tell her goodbye with Kip, she smiled at them. \"Bye guys try and behave. And do not plan another Smurf Bath in my absence without cleaning it up, 'kay?\" They nodded and agreed as Chaosia sighed dramatically, looking skyward before handing the now chuckling Kip the box. He carefully took it and shifted to where he was holding it with one arm as he bent down and hugged her shoulders. \"I'll try and keep them in line, Chaos. And I'll drop this on your desk when I get there and lock the door so no one can mess it up.\" She nodded, doing some odd hand shake with Mirror when he walked up and nodding once to Freb. She waved at the still blushing Toby and shook her head when he turned even redder. As they all started to disperse, Tumbler held back and waited until they were out of earshot. He looked down at her, smiling and held out his arms. Sphinx watched in amazement as she stood, shaking her head, and gave him a full hug, wrapping her arms around the boys waist as the boy did the same to her. She looked up at him and laughed, not caring that they had an audience. Tumbler grinned rakishly, his eyes shooting from Atley to Sphinx before asking, \"So? I'll see you the Wednesday after the stitches are gone?\" She nodded, pulling away to lightly punch his shoulder. \"Yeah. And you should be ready to bleed Tumbles. Because I am not going to take it easy on you.\" He nodded his eyes just a bit more serious as he nodded to the other two boosts and went to leave, calling back over his shoulder, \"I don't expect anything less, Chaosia.\" Sphinx eyed the boy as he left; suddenly feeling better that it was just him and Atley with her. Chaosia, however, didn't seem to share the sentiment. She shifted and moved in her seat, pulling herself away from them as she glanced at her now empty pool. Well, if she bloody wanted them then she could have them. Atley glanced at her just as Sphinx made the decision to stand and demand to leave. He wasn't going to stay where he wasn't wanted and it was clear by her refusal to even look at him that she'd changed whatever tune he'd thought she was playing. He knew she couldn't have wanted anything to do with him . . . \"So, now that the Wild Bunch is gone how's the shoulder?\" She looked at Atley, shocked for a second before smiling, relaxing and opening up a little. She glanced at him, shrugging. \"Not so bad anymore. Donnie really did a swell job patching it up.\" Her eyes darted to the stoic boost beside him and Atley knew what he saw there. He'd seen it constantly when Memphis and Sway were younger and had just met. A deep interest that was assumed to be unrequited by the subject, for whatever reason. And here again, Atley was no fool. He could see what they couldn't. She thought he didn't want anything to do with her because of his ways and Sphinx . . . Sphinx looked torn between homicide (Tumbler's) and self-mutilation. Actually, he'd never seen Sphinx try so hard not interact with someone. Dear Lord. He needed to move this along, for everyone's sakes. Besides, he had an unofficial bet with Raines and he never lost if he could help it. He nodded to Chaos. \"So? You and Tumbler getting together on Wednesdays now?\" She nodded, keeping her eyes most trained on him, but he saw them shift back to Sphinx ever so often. She was watching him. And though he didn't look it, he was watching her. Lord they were so damned alike but just different enough to be trouble. In the beginning anyway. \"Yeah, we're going to start boxing. I'm going to teach him a few things about Muay Thai and maybe some kendo. The exercise will help my shoulder and it'll be fun. And it's the perfect excuse to bring a friend of mine from Seal Beach up and introduce to him.\" Atley nodded, watching Sphinx relax almost undetectably at that tidbit. He chuckled. \"Oh? Going to play matchmaker?\" She shrugged, sipping her tea. \"Why not? They'd be cute and if it didn't work out they'd have a few good laughs to remember. Besides, Mia just loves boxers for some reason. I'm honestly beginning to think she has some kind of fetish. \" Atley's grin turned dark and he saw the opportunity to strike hard. It might cost him his head but he was going to force these two morons together by the end of the week if it killed him. \"And you don't? Pity . I thought you and Tumbler would be a good couple.\" She sputtered, spewing tea as she looked at him like he was crazy and Sphinx turned to glare at him discretely. He didn't dare look because the side of his face felt like it was on fire. But he continued on, outwardly unfazed by either reaction. \"Why not? He's young and attractive and the two of you seem to have a good bit in common. You're young and attractive and single . . . unless you have somebody in Seal Beach we don't know about . . .\" She shook her head; sitting the cup down and pushing her sunglasses back up as they fell. \"No, Atley I'm single. Look. Quit beating around the bush and just get to the damned point. I hate subterfuge and hints. Just be up front about it and I'll answer the question.\" He nodded, knowing that he was close. Sphinx was watching him openly now, glaring at him hard enough that he could feel the skin on his cheeks peeling away. All he could think at the moment was 'Please answer the way I want you to because I'm gonna die if you don't'. \"Are you interested in anyone or are you content to be on your own.\" She shrugged, leaning back carefully. Atley watched her work through what to say and not to say. She was anything but stupid and she knew that to say too much could be detrimental to everyone's health. Lord if she only knew. \"I was interested in somebody but I doubt it would work out. They barely seem to notice me anyway . . . so I got over it. Why? Wanna ask me to go to prom ?\" He chuckled, eying Sphinx as he sat up a little straighter. The big lug seemed to be putting the pieces together. Slowly. \" Maybe . I'll even get you a pretty corsage and everything.\" She laughed, seeing the joke but paled as he nodded to Sphinx. Atley watched him jump as he addressed him, seemingly shocked at what he asked. \"So Sphinx, will you let me take your girlfriend to the prom? I mean, you're not going to and I can at least carry on titillating conversations.\" Neither breathed as they watched Atley smirk. He was right ! Sphinx's eyes were wide and he looked like he was about to die. And Chaos . . . she just looked . . . she looked like he was dangling something wonderful but forbidden in front of her and she'd been craving it for years . She knew she couldn't have it but damn it she wanted it. He hoped that she got it as Sphinx opened his mouth to speak. Sphinx was torn. Atley had just rocked their collective world and was looking smug about it. And Chaos was just looking at him with this heart-wrenching look . . . she was preparing for the worst and he could see her pulling back from the answer she was sure was coming. He sighed. If he was going to get kicked, he might as well see it coming. He knew that she'd say no and tell Atley to drop whatever his angle was, that she was interested in one of the others but he had to say something . Besides, Atley Jackson was not getting the last laugh after the stunt he'd pulled earlier. He shrugged, trying to recompose himself. \"Sorry, Atley. But I think she needs to sit out. At least until that shoulder heals. Then do whatever. She isn't my girlfriend.\" He watched Atley's face sour before he smirked. Good lord, what was the man planning now? Staying ahead of Atley was like trying to predict the exact location of a tornado touching down. \"Well then, I'll show myself to the wall for now. Chaos, another day?\" She nodded, still stunned obviously as he winked down at her. Sphinx felt his already hot blood boil. God, Atley was going to roast for this. As Atley stood to leave, Chaos felt something in her snap. She was furious. Atley had apparently picked up on this-this chemistry that was between the two of them and was trying to play matchmaker . . . But Sphinx had all but thrown the fact that she was interested (or had been) back in both of their faces. She turned, smiling at Atley sweetly. Two could play this game . . . and she was the fucking master. She didn't like mind games. But she could play them. \"Atley? I'm free tomorrow night if you want to get something to eat. Maybe a drink?\" Atley smirked, nodding. \"Sure sweetheart. Anything you want.\" She laughed, reusing to look at Sphinx as he openly glared at Atley. \"Anywhere but the Anchor.\" Atley laughed, winking at her. \"Sure thing, sweetheart. See you at eight?\" She nodded, her smile going form sweet to devilish. She would so make him pay for putting her in this position. Both of them. And with that, the infamous Atley Jackson left Chaos sitting there staring at anything but the Sphinx. It was a few minutes later that he groaned, breaking Chaos out of her ignoring him. \" What? \" Sphinx knew he should've never gotten in the damned car with Atley. Something deep in his gut had warned him to stay away. But he'd come anyway. So now he'd landed himself in this mess and saw no way out of it. He'd all but lied to Chaosia and Atley's faces in an attempt to save his own. He just wasn't ready to admit that whatever he felt for the girl wasn't a passing fancy. Especially to her. He looked over at Chaosia. She was regarding him with this mixed look and he honestly couldn't tell if it was a good thing or a bad thing. He could see the anger and something else warring behind her sea glass eyes . . . She remembered herself enough to ask, \"What?\" \"I wonder if he remembers that he drove me here.\" She smirked. \"Well, I can take you to your car if you want. I need to go see Sway anyway. Just let me change and we can go.\" She stood, going toward the house with him following. He waited in the kitchen for her to come back downstairs and when she did, he was hard pressed to keep his hands to himself. God, did she have to dress like that? She was wearing cropped jeans similar to the ones from the garage with a long sleeved black shirt that clung to her curves like a second skin. The sleeves came to her knuckles but still showed off the muscle in her arms while the deep V of the neckline showed off her chest and the simple cord necklace she was wearing. She'd pulled her hair up and her sunglasses were perched in her hair, her white purse over her shoulder and keys in her hand. As she came to stand in front of him, she looked up at him with the same mixed look from the patio. She slowly stood on her tiptoes and looked at him in the eye, waving her hand in front of his face. \"Hello? Anyone in there?\" He snapped out of his daze, registering she was almost flush against him. She would fit perfect against him, her curves melding into the harder planes of his build. She pulled back quickly before he could react. She raised a brow at him but nodded, before easing back onto her flat feet and said, \"Let's go.\" He looked at her shocked and frozen as she blushed and turned to walk towards the door. She was almost by him when she stopped and glanced over her shoulder at him. \"I need to see Sway and maybe stop and see Atley, see where we're go-\" He looked at her intensely for a split second before spinning her to face him, crashing his lips against hers. Tongues met and battled as he pulled her hard into his chest, sliding one hand up into her hair, pulling it free of the tie, and the other down to the small of her back. Before either knew what was going on, her was back against the countertop with one of his legs between hers, supporting her weight. He lifted her easily with one hand, bringing her feet from their place on the ground to wrap around his waist. They stayed there even after he deposited her on her countertop. His hands were everywhere, taking purchase when they could find it while his hips ground into hers with every bruising pass of his lips. Suddenly his mouth moved down Chaosia's chin to her neck, biting and sucking hard as he went, causing her to moan as she ran my fingers through his short hair, leaving it mussed in their wake. When they finally broke for air, Sphinx looked down at her dazed look and kissed swollen lips and remembered himself. What in the hell had he just done? He stepped back like he'd been burnt, dropping his hands and moving away from Chaos completely. She sat there, shock evident on her face for a few moments as he just looked at her. Suddenly, shock turned to anger and outrage then her face shut down completely. She slid off the counter and, grabbing her keys, went to walk by him. Sphinx was torn but didn't know what to do or say if anything. He felt his gut clench at the sight of her obviously holding her temper in check but didn't she realize that this, whatever it was just wouldn't work? She stopped at the doorway to the sunroom, looking back over her shoulder at him. \"Are you coming?\" He sighed and went to follow, noticing her hands were clenched at her sides hard enough that the keys she was holding was cutting into her palms. Blood was dripping from her fist onto the tile floor. Sphinx, not thinking, reached out and caught her hand, pulling it up for him to see it. \"Jesus, girl. Relax or you'll go through to the bone.\" She glared at him, eyes cold as she pulled her bleeding hand free. \"What does it matter to you ? Just forget about it. Okay? As a matter of fact, forget about all of this. We'll just act like it never happened tomorrow but today I am not going to pretend that I'm not pissed. I should've known better than to even . . .\" She sighed, shoulders sagging and her chin dipped. In a small voice she almost begged him. \"Just drop it okay? I promise everything will go back to normal and I'll go back to leaving you alone. Just . . . don't act like you care. It obvious there's chemistry here but it's apparent that's all it is.\" He looked at her, truly amazed. How could someone so damned smart be so fucking daft? They'd almost . . . Hell he didn't know anything about her and he was about to . . . Oh bloody hell. Normally a casual dalliance wouldn't bother him but with her the thought of something limited just seemed wrong. And she had the damned nerve to call it just chemistry. For one of the few times in his adult life, Sphinx opened his mouth and spoke without thinking about what he was going to say. \" Chemistry? Girl, if we didn't have to breathe then you'd be back down on that counter screaming my name . . . and we'd both enjoy every bit of it. That's more than chemistry .\" She looked up at him, wide eyed and he had to stop himself from grabbing her again. The next thing Sphinx knew, there was a sharp pain and his world went dark for a few seconds. When he regained himself he realized that his jaw hurt so badly he was beginning to think it was broken and his lip was oozing blood. How the hell had that happened? He looked down and saw Chaosia's clenched, reddening fist and stared in shock. She'd bloody hit him. Chaosia Ripley Guadimus was many things, not the least of which was loyal and extremely intelligent. She was also the possessor of a unique ability to shut off completely from a matter and look at it from a logical point of view. And most of the time, it served her well. But today, in her kitchen, she was failing at removing herself from the situation. Because every time she tried, she remembered the feel of his body and lips and his desire for her in vivid, excruciating detail. Like it was happening again and again and again. But she was trying because she did like Sphinx. A lot . So much that she could force herself to be okay with just being friends even after he'd shattered her world with that kiss. So she had tried to be logical and give him the out that two people can be physically attracted to one another and not particularly care for the other. Hell, she'd been there with her last boyfriend toward the end of their relationship. He had the body of a Greek god and as long as his mouth wasn't moving he was okay to be around. But his attitude had been wanting. Desperately. And while it pained her to be in the reverse side of things, she could pull through it. And she would've made good on her promise to let it slip into the background and never say anything about it. But then he opened his mouth and brought what little hope she had of him actually liking her as anything down around her. As soon as the words registered with the look on his face . . . she snapped. Everything Paul and Sway had tried to tell her about being cool and distant vanished as her temper flared and wrath replaced her common sense. She'd never been good at containing her temper when she was this mad. Its why she would never fight when it was too personal. The garage ordeal had served as a reminder of what her Uncle Top was always drilling into her skull: Anger and passion lead to mistakes. And usually grand ones . It was the look that had done her in though. He was looking at her with regret. Regret (she thought) that he had touched her and dirtied his hands. That she had been the one he was so whatever to. And before she knew what had happened, she'd swung as hard as she could, and connected square with his jaw. His head had snapped to the side so sharply that she knew she'd probably just dislocated his jaw but for the life of her she couldn't make herself feel anything but justified. She needed to step back and get her temper under control or this would end badly. She had to get him out of here. Now. Sphinx looked at her, shocked as he held his darkening jaw and oozing lip. She tried to squash down the swelling pride that she'd drawn blood but she couldn't. God, she needed to get him out of here before he opened his mouth again. She turned, going to the sink and grabbing a towel from one of the drawers, wetting it in cool water and tossing it to him. She grabbed another and wrapped it around her now pouring hand. Why had she hit him with the damned hand with the keys? He caught the towel, still watching her with this look of . . . \" What?\" He opened his mouth, grimacing before popping his jaw back in place and wiping he blood away with the towel. \"You bloody hit me.\" She sighed, rolling her eyes and went to go back to the door. He moved to where he was in her path, causing her to look up at him. A nasty bruise was starting to blossom along his jawline and she felt the guilt and remorse building. Oh great. NOW she felt bad. He leaned in close, to where their noses were almost touching. He repeated himself, still amazed. \" You hit me . Why ? You're the one who said it was just chemistry .\" She looked away, knowing her eyes were tearing and hating it. Of course she had to cry when she got mad. \"You were being an ass . I was just trying to . . . Look. I'm not your girlfriend. I'm going on a date with your best friend and-\" He cut her off, pulling her into him and lowering his mouth to hers. Slowly and deliberately, he kissed her. As his hands slid down her body to their former positions, she could taste the blood from the busted lip she'd given him. She pulled back, taking the towel and holding it to the still oozing split in the skin. His eyes never left hers as she applied pressure to the wound. Finally, she removed it and nodded, almost to herself at the now clean and unbleeding wound. She looked up at him, peaking at his eyes through her lashes. He was still staring down at her intensely. She blushed and he leaned down kissing her softly, much softer than she ever thought a man his size and disposition would be capable of. When they parted, he leaned in to whisper in her ear. \"It's not just chemistry for me, Love.\"[Chapter 13] Chemistry Chaos pushed away from him. It wasn't just chemistry for him? But he couldn't be interested in her without someone else sniff at her coattails? What about the whole ordeal with Atley outside? She wasn't good enough to be a girlfriend but he could try to ravish her on her kitchen counter? On her very sore back at that. She glared up at him. She liked him. A lot. But she had to do this now or she would never do it. If he wanted her, it would be for her. Not some stupid territorial bullshit with Atley or Tumbler or Gandhi, if he decided he wanted a piece. She turned from him, going towards her back door. \"When it's something that has a name, Sphinx, we'll talk about it. Until then, it's just chemistry. We're attracted to each other. But I' am not going to get burned because I think you're attractive.\" She glanced back over her shoulder at him. \"Are you coming?\" Sphinx stood there, amazed. She was positively the most infuriating and addicting thing he'd ever come across. Even as she stood there, looking at him like she didn't care that he'd just kissed the life out of her, she was the epitome of beauty. His definition of beauty, anyway. He'd never been one for hellcats and tough-as-nail bitches but she was definitely starting to change that predilection. He gathered himself, knowing that for now he couldn't do anything but wait. She'd proved it was more than chemistry with the way she was shutting down on him. The way her eyes kept lingering back to his lips even as she grimaced at him. If anything, she was just as addicted to him as he was to her. And all from one bloody kiss. He nodded, quickly bridging the gap between them. \"Sure girlie. Whatever you want.\" She glared at him then turned and walked out the back door to the garage. And the whole time he couldn't keep his eyes from following her hips. Did she know they swayed more when she was angry? When they got to her Aston, she opened the last garage door and unlocked the car, pointedly ignoring the deadpan look she received from him as he shook his head. Her and locking doors. As they got in and got situated, she glanced over at him. He caught her look and nodded to her. She understood that it meant to continue. \"Is your car at the garage?\" He nodded, turning to look at her directly as she started the car. He'd pulled her hair loose in the kitchen and it was trying to escape the confines of the elastic band that was holding it, meaning dozens of little gold curls were spilling down the side of her neck and face, framing the tanned skin in shades of gold and strawberry blonde. He shook himself. He would not act like Memphis. He wouldn't start tailing the girl and begging her to come and be with him. He had more pride than that. He'd make her come to him. Smug with that knowledge, he settled back and let her drive, never noticing the glances she kept shooting him from beneath her lashes. Atley watched with Donnie and Memphis as Chaosia's Aston pulled into the lot at Otto's. The three of them shared a look at the nervous shrug the girl gave Sphinx before he nodded to her and she glared at him as he opened the door to get out. She waited until he was to the three of them before waving and speeding away from the garage like the devil himself was on her tail lights. Atley and Memphis glanced at one another while Donnie nodded and greeted the Sphinx. \"Hey, man. Have a good visit?\" Sphinx nodded once, shooting Atley a dark glare as he walked past the three of them and towards the office where he'd left his keys. If looks could kill . . . Atley gulped as Memphis shook his head and Donnie chuckled, clapping him on the back. \"Sorry man. Nice knowing ya. What's made him give you that sour look?\" Atley sighed, pushing his hair further into his scalp nervously as Memphis explained, giving him a sympathetic smirk. \"Atley decided to force the two of them into close company and make them spend time together.\" Donnie raised a brow, obviously intrigued. \"Oh really? And the how the hell did you do that?\" Atley felt his cheeks flush as he shrugged and mumbled, \"I ditched him there after antagonizing him in front of her.\" Donnie paled as Memphis nodded, laughing. \"See, I told you it was a bad idea. To just let the two of them find their own way but oh no.\" Atley nodded, shoulders slumping. \"that's not the worst part. The big idiot refused to play along so now I have a date with the girl tomorrow night.\" Donnie and Memphis stopped, amazed at the information their friend had just dropped. Donnie whistled, eyeing his friend sypmathically. \"Man, oh man, Atley . . .\" Atley grumbled, looking up just in time to see Sphinx come strolling back out of the garage, keys in a massive hand. The stoic man nodded to the three of them as he passed, going towards his Malibu. All three shared a look. If he was snubbing Atley completely then . . . Atley shot forward as quickly as his limp would allow, calling to the Sphinx as he opened the door to the Malibu. \"HEY! Wait up.\" Sphinx turned, looking at him with a brow raised as Atley leaned against his open door trying to catch his breath. His longtime friend had dashed to the car (probably to gloat or gossip) and was now paying for it with his bad leg from the looks of it. Sphinx sighed, seating himself in the driver's side and allowing Atley room to come around and talk. \"Look, Sphinx . . . I'm sorry if I put you in . . . I just thought that maybe the two of you would hit it off and . . .\" Sphinx watched Atley amazed as he showed he was truly flustered for the first time he'd known him. Atley never got flustered. Ever. Finally, after stammering on for a few minutes he stopped and looked at him straight faced. \"I'm sorry and I won't meddle again . . . . I just don't want to lose our . . . .\" Sphinx nodded, seeing where this was going and had to force down the warring parts of his severe nature. One part wanted to draw out this little song and dance and increase Atley's suffering to punish him for meddling in the first place while the other just wanted him to stop period. He settled on a combination of the two. He waved him off, nodding once before cranking his car. Atley looked relieved as his shoulders slumped and he nodded. \"So we're good then? No hard feelings . . .\" Sphinx nodded again and shrugged his brows, reaching a hand out to rest on the interior door handle. \"So long as you don't go and sweep her off her feet tomorrow night . . . then no, Jackson. No problem.\" Atley took the clue and stepped back, suddenly the epitome of calm and collected again. He nodded, waving Sphinx off and turning to go back to the others as Sphinx closed the door and brought his engine roaring to life. He smirked ever-so-slightly to himself as he heard the deep idle of the engine and felt the vibration of the car as he waited for Atley to be a safer distance away for him to pull off. He didn't know why but knowing that Atley had been worried about messing up their working and non-working relationship with his stunt made him feel . . . better. He shook himself, putting the car in gear and pulling out onto the service road. He navigated the streets and side roads, heading towards his apartment. Atley probably wouldn't go tomorrow to protect their friendship, he was sure. And if did, he would make sure it was a horrible experience for the girl. Which would teach her a lesson in playing mind games. He gave her a few days and she would calm down enough to be approachable. They could talk and then things could get on and life could finally go somewhere resembling normal. He hoped. Atley sighed, slinging the hacky sack the boys had left in the office into the air to catch it again. Once he'd picked the lock out of sheer boredom, he had found he didn't have anything else to do but sit and admire their new office. He had to admit, Chaos knew how to find some comfy ass chairs. He groaned, slumping further into the arm chair as he stewed. He was torn. If he didn't go with Chaos tomorrow it would definitely hurt her feelings . . . and let her know it had all been a ploy. Something he didn't want to do. But if he went and she had fun then Sphinx would probably skin him alive. Hurt a friend or get skinned . . . Decisions. Decisions . The sound of a key hitting the lock broke him from his thoughts. Who in the world was coming in this office at seven o'clock at night? He sat still, waiting for the person to emerge . . . . and was amazed that it was Chaos. She had her hair down and wild, barely held back by the sunglasses atop her head. Her black shirt and jeans wasn't too different from what she normally wore but for some reason she just looked . . . more grown up. She sighed, sitting the bag down in one of the teal chairs before she spotted him. She smiled at him, the weariness of that small smile bothering him a great deal. He sighed, sitting up straight and looked at her as she sat in the chair across from him. \"Wanna talk about it, sweetheart?\" She looked up at him, eyes watering, and the flood gates opened. Chaosia knew opening up to Atley had been a very bad idea. He and Sphinx were close. Very close from the little display earlier. And she wasn't going to mess that up. But maybe, he could help her. If not to get Sphinx then to tell her to get over it. To move on before she got hurt. To do . . . something other than wait and see. Finally, after they'd sat there for a good thirty minutes, her stomach growled. She glanced up, blushing. \"Wanna get something to eat?\" He nodded, following her out and to her car. Food was always good for broken hearts . . . almost as good as good company. Maybe she could get both. Dinner had been a good idea. This time at least. She'd taken Atley to this place near the aquarium that was a whole-in-the-wall dive but had tables outside on a deck overlooking the water. They'd ordered a large pepperoni, mushroom, onion, olive and green pepper pizza (his choice) and had eaten most of it. Apparently Sphinx wasn't the only one who hadn't been eating. Chaosia seemed much more relaxed as she watched the waves and drank her beer, commenting on some random tidbit that would pop to mind ever so often. She was a proverbial wealth of useless and interesting information. She was currently telling him about a jelly fish eating coral. And he wasn't buying it. \"Don't shake your head at me, Atley. It's true! The Mushroom coral or Fungia scruposa documented by a group of divers eating moon jellyfish in the Red Sea. Coral usually feed on tiny plankton as well as products provided by photosynthetic algae. But now researchers are beginning to believe that the ability to feed on a variety of food sources, like jellyfish, is an evolutionary adaptation. It could give the coral reefs an advantage with the changes happening in the marine world.\" Atley shook his head laughing, knowing she was probably right but he loved seeing her so riled up because he doubted her. She crossed her arms, looking away from him and towards the bay. A water sprout caught both of their attention and he watched Chaosia's eyes light up. He knew whales were common in Long Beach but watching Chaosia watch them made him appreciate the sight for the first time. \"What type are they?\" She looked out, never taking her eyes of the spouts as she started. \"It's probably blue whales or finbacks from the size of the spray. Blues are the largest known whale in the world with finbacks coming in a close second and Long Beach sees plenty of them during the Summer and Fall.\" Atley nodded, watching her as she continued to watch the whales. She was smiling and looking out at the water like she was awed by their very presence, unfolding her arms and laying one back on the table. He smirked, reaching across andpatting her hand in his, rubbing the top of it with his thumb before letting it fall to the glass top table again. She turned to him and smiled at him so happily he was about to check and see if she was really looking at him. No one had looked at him like that in a long time. And he knew for fact that no one had probably ever looked at Sphinx like that without losing an eye. So why was his friend doing this? Atley knew that now that Sphinx had seen the way they could work, he felt the absence of it profoundly when she wasn't there. Atley snorted. His friend was in for a rude awakening over the next few days. He may not want anyone else's attention but he could see he was going to steadily crave hers. Especially if she was looking at him like that. Had she been looking at Sphinx like that since they met? It was impossible to think they'd missed it. As the sun started to set into the horizon, Atley handed their waitress the money for the bill, his smug grin at Chaosia's pout proof he knew she wanted to pay for this. As they left the restaurant, Chaos pulled him towards the beach, showing him the whales as close as she could, telling him about how the smaller shadows were actually calves. Atley listened, laughing with her when one of the calves jumped and landed back in the water. She confessed to him that she'd never had a boyfriend or guy friend or friend-with-benefits or any one that would walk on the beach with her. And Atley made up his mind that by God, Sphinx was going to. He sighed, pulling her into a friendly hug. \"C'mon sweetheart, the tide will be coming in soon. Better head back.\" She nodded, walking with him back to the boardwalk. As they got to the car, she looked at him, suddenly confused. \"Does this count as dinner?\" Atley chuckled. \"Nah, sweetheart. This is just two friends going out. Tomorrow can be dinner. I'll even make sure to get the big lug there to see you all dolled up.\" She blushed, opening the doors. She waited until he was in the car to tell him what was on her mind. \"You don't have to do that, Atley. And we don't have to go out. It's not like it'll make a difference anyway.\" Atley smirked, leaning across the console to pat her hand. \"Don't you worry about a thing, sweetheart. Let ol' Atley take care of the big idiot. We're just going to go out and have a nice meal and maybe dance.\" She smiled at him. \"Really?\" He nodded, suddenly looking much more mischievous than normal. \"Absolutely. Just wear something red. That's his favorite color.\"[Chapter 14] Fruition Sway had called her at about two o'clock, begging her to come in and help with some case file for a few hours. So now, hours later, she was still trying to figure out exactly how the idiot Mitchell had lost almost an entire intake system. Oh sure, it was in the garage somewhere but the issue was trying to find the damned thing before it went into someone else's car. She sighed, pushing her glasses up and into her hair. She'd heard the Malibu pull in at the same time she'd heard Atley's Vette . . . and she had been hiding in here until she absolutely had to leave. Thank God she'd had the fortitude to remember her dress and accessories . . . She looked over at Sway, who going through the other invoices for the day, trying to spot the location. \"Hey Sway?\" She never looked up, merely answered. \"Yeah?\" \"Do you know what time it is?\" Sway stopped, glancing at the clunky black watch on her wrist. She did a double take, running her hand over her eyes. \"Jesus, it's almost seven thirty.\" Chaos nodded, going back to filing . . . before shooting up and staring at Sway. \"Oh shit! I have to get ready! Sway help!\" Sway laughed, chunking the paperwork into the box. \"Sure. It has to beat this shit.\" Chaosia fidgeted with the red silk dress, nervous about how it would look to the others as she exited the bathroom at the garage. This definitely didn't look like anything she'd worn here so far . . . But the dress really was pretty . . . and practically new. She'd never worn it out, only tried it on to purchase it for the rehearsal dinner for Bastian's wedding. Sway circled her, clucking her tongue as she took in the silk monstrosity. The rich, vibrant red silk dress was one shouldered with a tiered fitted body ending just above the knee, hugging her curves the whole way. The almost completely open back was another plus, showing off her tattoo while partially covering the scaring on her back. She'd brought the huge teardrop ruby and diamond earrings to wear with the dress, as well as pair of to die for red stilettos. She smirked, looking down at the shoes. Who was she kidding? These were fuck-me-shoes if she'd ever seen them . . . and she loved the way they made her legs look. The red crepe satin stiletto pumps were approximately 4\" high and Christian Louboutin to boot. What gave the pumps the extra little something was the large satin two-tone bow on the back of the heel, pointed toe and a signature red sole. With all of that on the dress and shoes, she was forgoing jewelry save the earrings, and keeping her make-up very natural . . . except for the glossy red lipstick Sway had forced on her. She sighed again, flipping her tousled curls over her shoulder as she grabbed her red clutch. Time to face the music. Sway left the bathroom first, grinning like the Cheshire cat. She knew that no one was expecting what was in that bathroom, not even Atley. She just hoped he could remember to behave and not try to steal the poor girl for himself . . . She winked as she passed Memphis, who raised a brow at her questioningly. She smirked and continued, stopping in front of Atley and Donnie. They were talking about the place Atley was taking Chaos while Sphinx leaned against the wall behind them, glowering at the back of Jackson's head. So he was jealous . . . Sway looked over to Atley, smiling. He really did clean up nicely when he wanted to. He had on simple black trousers and a black dress shirt, tucked in under a matching jacket, a black leather belt and loafers finishing off the look. Looped around his neck was a red tie, waiting to be set to rights when it was time to leave. He was, oddly, clean shaven and his hair was slicked back per normal. The only thing truly out of place was the bright red rose clipping tucked on his lapel. Sway smirked. He really was going all out for this. When Sphinx's head snapped up and towards the door, Sway knew he'd seen Chaos. But what she didn't expect was for him to push away from his spot and come to join their group, openly staring at Chaos the whole time. She was suddenly glad the younger crew wasn't here or this would've gotten very ugly very quickly. She smirked, watching the drama unfold. Who needed soap operas when she lived with this? Chaos smiled as she saw Atley, shaking her head at the rose on his lapel. He took the prom joke and ran with it, apparently. She felt more than saw Sphinx's eyes on her as she cleared the space between them, trying to look at him even as he came to join the group. Donnie, sensing the tension, whistled at her and took her hand, spinning her around. \"Damn girl, you clean up nice. Where on earth did you hide those legs?\" She blushed laughing as he twirled her again. \"I've been walking on them, Donnie. I just don't show them off all the time.\" Donnie shook his head, looking at her shoes with morbid curiosity. \"Damn shame I say. How about you Memphis? Think we should make her wear stuff like this to greet clients?\" Memphis chuckled, answering when Sway nodded it was okay. Chaos blushed, but grinned. He was so whipped. \"Only if she wears those shoes too.\" She smiled, taking Atley's outstretched hand as he motioned for them to leave. \"Well boys and gals, we need to be heading on. Our reservations are for eight thirty so . . .\" She nodded, waving goodbye to the others as Atley lead her to the door. Once they were out of earshot, he sighed. \"Damn girl, are you trying to get me killed? I said wear something red not wear something to make him see red. He's going to rip my head off for touching you.\" Chaos rolled her eyes, patting Atley's arm soothingly. \"Don't be absurd, At. I'm sure he's not going to do anything like that . . . where are we going anyway?\" He grinned sheepishly. \"We're going to Utopia. If we make it. See, I have a hunch that we won't even make it in the car before he comes from garage and wants to talk to you.\" Chaosia raised a brow, opening her mouth just to shut it when she saw Sphinx step out and into the night air. She turned and raised a brow at Atley, stunned. Atley just smirked, pulling her closer like he didn't see Sphinx walking towards them at a leisurely pace. He smiled at Chaos and winked, leaning in close enough to whisper in her ear. And deliberately made it look like his lips were on her cheek. \"And after I do this, we probably won't be going anywhere . . .\" She turned, looking at him perplexed. \"After you do wha-\" He cut her off with his lips against hers, pulling her flush against him. And though the kiss looked intense and passionate, Atley made sure to keep it as neutral and casual as possible. He sighed against her, knowing that in about fifteen seconds he was going to be in a world of pain and suffering. Oh well, better enjoy it while it lasts. He started counting back to one from ten, feeling himself being ripped away when he hit three. Nice. Sphinx's fuse was shorter than he thought. When he was pulled back, he ducked just enough to avoid the ground without pulling Sphinx with him. Said man was standing there, glaring at him like he was about to take his head off. He turned from Atley and looked to Chaos, obviously pissed about what had been transpiring. \"Damn it girl, are you trying to kill me?\" Chaosia glared up at Sphinx as he glowered down at her. She wasn't so upset that he'd broken up the fake kiss or the fake date . . . but she was pissed that he was still acting like this. She knew from what Sway said Sphinx had a very severe nature, and Atley had only reiterated that fact, but she had seen glimpses of how gentle he could be, had felt it when he kissed her after she'd socked. And damn it she wanted that right side of him about now. She took a step closer, bringing them toe-toe as she jabbed his chest with a finger. \"Look buster. Who I kiss is none of your damned business. I told you when you could give whatever you felt for me a name other than 'not just chemistry' then we'd talk. But until then, Sphinx, I am not supposed to sit around and wait on you. You've already said I'm not your girlfriend . . . hell I'm not even your friend . But I refuse to be a fuck buddy or a fling. I'm worth more than that. If not to you then definitely to somebody else.\" He growled at her, his scowl darkening as he dipped his head until their noses were touching. \"And what do you call this then? Last I recalled you weren't Atley's girlfriend either.\" She smirked, leaning forward to where their lips her ghosting over his as she spoke. \"What does it matter to you? I'm not yours to keep, Sphinx. You've said it yourself.\" He looked at her then, his eyes scanning hers before his lips spread into the darkest grin she'd ever seen. He dipped his head, running his cheek against hers before pulling back just enough to inform her. \"No. Not yet. But don't worry girlie. If its what you want you will be.\" And with those fifteen words uttered, he slammed his lip against hers with almost bruising force, pulling her completely into him as he wrapped himself around her. She never stood a chance. Once his lips hit hers, she melted into him, throwing her arms around his neck as he attacked her mouth. Neither cared that they had an audience, or that money was being exchanged. All that mattered was his lips on hers. Atley grinned, excepting the money from Memphis and Donnie as they turned to give the two warbirds some privacy. Finally. Sway sighed, leaning into Memphis as he grumbled about Atley cheating. Sway patted his arm, smiling up at him. \"Don't worry honey. They'll fight again so you can win next time, okay?\" Memphis glowered at her while Donnie chuckled, not the least bit upset he'd just shelled out over two hundred dollars to the infamous Mr. Jackson. He was just happy their friend was finally admitting that he might need someone to make him happy. And God did he pick an interesting one to want.[Chapter 15] Bar None Sphinx watched as Chaosia's blush increased at his admission. She glanced at him, wrapping her arms around his neck as he pulled her closer. \"So what next then?\" He shrugged. \"We go slow and do what we want in private. But around the others . . .\" Chaosia seemed to understand, her eyes darkening as she got used to the idea. He could tell she didn't like it but she would do it. She grinned up at him. \"After tonight, you mean . . .\" He glowered but nodded, dipping to catch her lips again quickly before releasing them. She looked back up at him, blushing again as she nodded. \"Okay . . . but what about when no one is around? Like at the garage when it's your turn to babysit me? Is that private or around the others?\" He shrugged again, dipping his forehead to touch hers. \"As long as the door's shut I would call it private.\" She seemed fine with that, nodding again as she stepped back from him. \"Do you want to go apologize to Atley? You know, for throwing him in the dirt.\" He nodded, not liking the fact that he would have to apologize to anyone. But he knew it was necessary. If he stayed here and didn't go and at least try and make peace . . . then the others would surely gossip. And while whatever they could think up would most probably be true he didn't want any of them talking about Chaosia. Period. She smiled up at, leaning up and kissing the underside of his jaw. He suppressed a shutter before dipping his lips to hers again. Lord, she had to quit doing that to him . . . She pulled him with her, heading towards the paint dock at the back. He sighed, knowing that it was now or never. He knew Atley had been playing, pushing buttons to get a rile out of him. He was a master at it. But when he'd seen his lips hit Chaos . . . he hadn't been able to stop himself from wrenching them apart. At least she wasn't put off by the fact that he'd acted so impulsively and possessively. As they neared the entrance to the garage, she glanced over at him. He caught her look and nodded to her. She understood that it meant to continue. \"Uh? Do you want to go get something to eat after this? You kind of threw a wrench in my dinner plans and I think my stomach is going to eat my spine soon.\" He stopped, thinking. He could stand to eat. Actually the thought of food was marvelous. He hadn't been eating all week and now that they seemed to have settled their . . . relationship, he was ravenous. He nodded and she smiled at him, pulling him through the open door. \"Great. I found this really cool little place. And it's quiet . Now, let's go apologize to Atley.\" Atley smirked the second he saw Sphinx, walking up and clapping his friend on the arm. He nodded to Sphinx, letting him know all was well and forgiven. Sphinx nodded, feeling a little lighter now that he saw the grin on Atley's face and the knowing look in the other's eyes. It didn't bother him that they knew . . . but he didn't want anyone else finding out anytime soon. He and Chaos had a lot to work through . . . starting with getting her out of that dress and back into her jeans before he went crazy. Sway came around and hugged Chaos, not caring in the least that she was stick partially tucked under Sphinx's arm. Sphinx raised a brow. No when did this happen? Sway turned, looking up to him with a wink before stepping back and going to Memphis. Who was just looking between them with a mixture of happiness and sullenness. Donnie came around and clapped Sphinx on the shoulder, laughing. \"Don't worry about him, my man. He's just pissed Atley won is all. Hell he should've known better than to bet against him. Especially on you.\" Sphinx glowered at Atley who just laughed, unfazed by the harsh look, and shrugged. \"Hey, he started it. Besides, I think you got the better deal.\" Sphinx raised a brow as Chaosia blushed, hiding her face in his chest. It hit him. He was getting the better deal. Dinner had been a good idea. While it lasted, anyway. They'd gone to eat at Rosario's, which forced Chaos to change back into her skinny jeans and black turtleneck . . . but she left the heels on just to torture him. As they'd eaten in relative silence, Sphinx had been able to really look at her. She still had her make-up on and the earrings . . . though he'd kissed her lipstick off earlier. She had this huge plate of chicken Marsala that she was trying to eat through . . . but he knew he'd probably be taking it home with them. She looked up, rolling her eyes when she spotted his empty plate. He quirked a brow. \"Only you could eat that much and still eye my plate . . . it's got to be a male boost thing.\" She speared a chunk of chicken on her fork, extending it for him to try, \"Here. Try this. It's pretty good.\" He shrugged, taking the bite. He blinked. Not bad. Pretty soon, she was feeding him as much off of her plate as she was herself, not that he minded in the least. He had to pretend to care though when she flicked mashed potatoes on his nose when he stole her last sip of wine. Chaos kicked off her heels, watching Sphinx shed his boots and socks and cuff his jeans two more times to keep them semi clean before shaking his head and walking with her down the beach. Atley had called and asked to speak to him, apparently telling him to take her to a beach. Normally, she would've been upset at the leading but today she was in too good of a mood to complain about it. Besides, Atley was just being helpful. As they strolled, Chaos kept up a steady ramble, talking almost constantly while he listened. He didn't seem to mind. As a matter of fact, when she'd stop, he'd squeeze her hand or nude her to continue. Which is how she ended up with almost two handfuls of beach debris to take home with her, though he was the one actually holding most of it. She would pick up different pieces of shell and coral as they walked; telling him what each kind was as they found it. She almost didn't notice him looking at her as she chattered away, holding the two rocks she'd found. Both were smoothed out pieces of coral that had been formed by the tides and erosion to look like river rocks. And while they were similar in shape they were different in size and color. The largest was such a dark charcoal it was almost black while the other was pale bone white with little veins of coral pink littered around the edges. They would go well in her shell and san jars at home . . . She looked up at him when he stopped, blushing when she saw the intensity of his gaze was focused solely on her and not the pieces of coral she had in her hands. She smiled at him, walking back to lean against his chest as he smirked down at her. She shivered and he pulled her closer to him, wrapping his arms around her. The waves crept closer and higher, covering their feet almost to their ankles. \"The tides coming in. We'd better go before we get soaked. \" He nodded, leaning down and kissing her thoroughly. He literally swept her off her feet, holding her to him as he devoured her mouth in the dying rays of the sun with the waves crashing softly around their-well his bare feet. As he set her down she was breathless and flushed but she clung to him the way he'd seen Sway cling to Memphis. Lord, he'd never thought he'd want that until he got it. And now he wasn't sure he could ever do without it. Suddenly, years of Memphis's odd behavior and baffling compromises made perfect sense. He couldn't say he wouldn't be pressed to do the same if things progressed the same way with Chaosia that they had for Sway and Memphis. . . but the beauty of Chaos was she wanted him for him. No changes or adjustments required. And in that respect, as he walked hand in hand with Chaosia back to their shoes and the car, he was the luckiest bastard in the world. Bar none.[Chapter 16] Normal . . . . Or Something Like It Classes had sucked, but they wouldn't be classes if they didn't. The ride back to the garage after class hadn't been that pleasant either. What with the assholes almost side swiping her car and trying to run her off the damned road. Actually the only thing about earlier today that had been good was walking into Otto's and seeing Sphinx waiting on her in the office. She'd shed her coat and bags and launched herself at him, burying her nose into the crook of his neck as he wrapped his arms around her. He'd held her until she'd wanted to be let go, sitting in the chair behind the desk while she perched herself on the edge, her flip flopped feet balanced on his thighs as she rattled on about her deep sea lab. She still couldn't believe they were going out Friday, being as it was the first week and all . . . but she was excited nonetheless. Actually, it had been the only good thing about school, and even it was tainted by the knowledge she would be the only one with any sea hours to bring to the table. Sphinx listened, holding her hand in his, rubbing the top of her hand with his thumb as she told him about her day. Finally, she took a deep breath and smiled at him. \"So? Did you work today?\" He nodded, reaching out and pulling her down and into his lap with a squeak. She smacked his chest, giggling before his lips latched onto hers. She closed her eyes, relaxing into his arms as their mouths moved together. She could do this all day if he'd let her . . . She pulled back long enough to nip his bottom lip with her teeth, preparing herself for the onslaught that would befall her neck when she did that. He looked up at her, eyes aflame, before he started working his way up the curve of her neck and her jaw, stopping long enough to trace the shell of her ear with his tongue before nipping it with his teeth. Sphinx stood, setting her on the desk and turning to leave her to her work before she caught his hand and pulled him back to her. As he stood looking down at her as she looked up at him, she knew she should be doing work . . . and not contemplating making out with Sphinx in the office . . . but he looked too nice in the dark jeans and black tee shirt for her to pass up kissing him at least one more time. He dipped his head as she raised hers, their lips meeting halfway. She smiled into the kiss, before reaching out and popping the left strap to his suspenders. He growled against her lips, deepening the kiss as he pulled her flush against him. He hated it when she did that . . . but she loved the way he reacted when she did . . . As they parted the last time, she ran her nose along his chin. \"Go play . . . just don't kill anyone. Okay? I'm not cleaning up more blood. Especially if I didn't spill it.\" He grinned darkly, kissing her quickly before leaving the office. As she slipped into her seat to finish up her paperwork, she had to admit, when she saw Sphinx she would've never guessed the man loved to kiss as much as she did . . . or that he would leave her breathless every time he did so. She grinned, starting on the invoices. Not that was a bad thing. Later, after all of her invoices were completed, Chaosia journeyed out of the office and decided to stay with Kip and Memphis. Much to Sphinx's chagrin. He hated it when she worked with other people now. Before, when he was trying to ignore her, he had been thrilled to send her off to the others to deal with . . . but now that he had her he wanted to keep her close all of the time. Something Atley and Memphis had assured him was a normal development for how strongly he and Chaosia had attached to one another . . . But it didn't make him feel any better. He knew he couldn't actually keep her with him all of the time, but it was a nice thought to entertain. Especially with the way Kip's crew seemed to gravitate towards her. Tumbler had to be told that he couldn't hang all over her anymore by Memphis when they'd finally meshed everything out . . . after they almost had to pry Sphinx off of him of course. The boy just didn't know when to stop. Chaosia had warned him that she was starting to see someone and the boy had acknowledged it. Then proceeded to pick her up and spin her around, laughing as she screamed for him to put her down. That's when he'd come in and told the boy to drop her, resulting in Chaos being dumped unceremoniously at their feet. She'd smacked both of them in the legs, standing and brushing herself off before locking herself and Sway in the office. Sphinx shook himself, following Atley into Memphis's work bay. They weren't going to check on Chaos . . . they were going to make sure Memphis hadn't killed Kip on the engine diagnostic they were running. Chaosia's presence was just a perk. It was the first time Kip had helped fix an engine, apparently, and he eager to prove he knew something about it . . . Which is how the three of them ended up pulling apart the motor of a friend of Donny's. And even Chaosia could tell that the heads were shot . But no matter hom many times Chaos and Memphis told him that the engine was pretty much screwed, Kip refused to admit defeat until the thing refuse to turn over. Chaosia sighed, shaking her head as she wiped the grease and grim from the engine on her borrowed coveralls. Sway had donated them to her so she wouldn't have to babysit the wayward Raines brothers. She sighed. She had stood there amazed, covered in oil and grease, arguing with Kip about whether or not the motor would run. He just wasn't giving up. She sighed again, looking under the hood at the hunk of metal that used to be an engine. It could be fixed . . . but it would be far more expensive than just replacing it out right. Little did she know that Kip just had to crank it to make sure it wasn't roadworthy. And chose to do so at that precise moment. With her under the hood. As she was inspecting the starter, seeing if it could be parted out . . . she squealed jumping as Memphis and Kip gunned the motor and water sprayed out of the engine, soaking her coveralls and hair. She looked down in horror, suddenly thankful for the coveralls . . . and sorrowful that for all Sway had done for her she was about to kill her lover and his baby brother. Sphinx and Atley stood there amazed. Chaosia was soaked and cussing worse than Sway, threatening to kill Kip and Memphis for laughing. Atley just gave in and laughed as she started to go after Kip but when Chaosia turned around . . . She didn't even care that the two had walked in. She just shrugged out of the top of the coveralls and started pulling her hair back. Growling when she saw the huge droplets of oil in her blonde tresses. Sphinx was in shock, watching that water trickle down her neck, mixing with sweat and grease . . . and then she started pouting when she spotted Atley, coming to tell him about it. God, he wasn't even sure she'd seen him yet, she was so livid. Sphinx was getting to see so much of the attitude and temper she hid around him . . . and it was glorious. He would definitely have to tell her to let loose and be herself. Her temper may intimidate the others (and it did from the way Kip was cowering) but he was awed by it. Suddenly, Memphis started snickering, causing Chaos to turn and glare at him. \"And just what in the hell is so funny, Raines?\" He chortled, leaning against the dead car. \"Look at your boy. He's so petrified he can't even move . I think you've scared him away, Chaos.\" Chaosia growled, grabbing the first thing she could and chucking it at Memphis as he turned to run. When Sway came back an hour later, Atley had to explain that Chaosia wasn't there because Sphinx had literally picked her up and taken her home . . . And that Memphis was unconscious because she'd caught him the back of the head with a tire iron for embarrassing her. . . Chaosia winced as her mother's no nonsense tone flooded the house via speaker phone. She sighed, shifting in the huge tub to get herself comfortable as she listened to her mother rant about her inability to just behave. Again. \" I swear, Chaos, I named you perfectly. You're always the source of whatever chaos you find yourself in, do you know that?\" She heard the exasperated sigh from the receiver and wondered if her father was okay. He'd known for a whole week before breaking and telling her mother . . . a new record for her old man and secrets. \"So you keep telling me, Mom. But you don't need to worry. I'm fine. All of those fights with Mikhail and Bastian and those self-defense lessons you guys insisted on paid off, okay? I lived.\" \" And what about your back, young lady? Did you even think about how this could affect the scar tissue from your wreck? \" She rolled her eyes, knowing that the action was wasted but doing so anyway. Her mother was a habitual worrier. And she loved to make Chaos the subject of that worrying. Usually it was whether or not she would ever find a decent boyfriend and settle down and give her grandchildren or be a little more comfortable with herself and her place in both worlds her parents came from and not just the one she wanted . . . but tonight it seemed that it was going to be her activities since relocating to Long Beach. She sighed, shifting in the water to get a better grip on the phone. This needed to end. Quick. \"Mom, it's fixed and won't even be noticeable. Look, I love you but I need to go. I have to get ready I'm expecting company.\" Her mother's snort brought a smile to her lips. Only her mom could snort and make it sound ladylike. \" Oh yes, that reminds me. What's this I hear about you only being there this long and already having a new boyfriend? Are you a glutton for punishment?\" Chaos rolled her eyes again, standing from the bubbles and going to grab her towel. \"He's my new boyfriend Mother . . . we haven't been together a few days . . . and I've been here over a month, thank you.\" She heard the snort again. \" A boyfriend with all of the benefits I bet. Just be careful . . . I don't want to have to pick up the pieces this time, Ripley. I know you're a big girl but I really want you to take this time for yourself and live a little. You deserve so much more than what you're letting yourself settle for and . . . . Just promise you won't get too serious with this or anything else without talking to me and your father. Okay?\" Chaos sat, shocked by her mother's words. She knew that her mom had always wanted more for her than what her brothers (and even her father if she was completely honest with herself) did . . . but she rarely ever said it. And to hear the words was . . . endearing and enraging all at once. She knew her mother worshiped her father and that she wouldn't trade anything for their live together . . . but she was steadfast on ensuring that all of her children didn't go down the same road of boosting and heartache that had brought the two of them together in the first place. She sighed . . . her mother really was a confusing and complicated person . . . no wonder her dad was so damned crazy . . . \"I will. I love you.\" \" I love you too, you crazy child. I'll see you bright and early tomorrow. Your brothers and I are coming shopping.\" Chaos smirked as the line went dead. She wondered what the dynamic duo had done to insight that punishment . Mom usually only reserves that for Dad. She shrugged, drying off and throwing on a pair of lacey cheeky panties and a tank top before grabbing her robe and moving to the bedroom. She still had time before Sphinx got there and she wanted to at least sit down downstairs and relax before having to figure out exactly what this was between them. As she slipped on her cropped and ripped jeans from before, she sighed. She still couldn't bring herself to believe that this was something more than just an experiment to the stoic and reserved boost. As she tossed her towel in the hamper and made her way downstairs, she had to quell the rising butterflies in her belly. He wasn't even here yet and she was already a wreck. She couldn't wait until Paul got here to help her with this mess . . . She flopped down in her armchair under the stairs, pulling the soft afghan up and over her as she picked up her book. She knew it was in bad taste, especially with her major, but Peter Benchley's White Shark was one of her favorites . . . and would help her pass the time until a predator of a completely different nature graced her with his presence. As she flipped to her page, she had to agree with her assessment of her new . . . boyfriend . . . Sphinx was a predator in his own right. Silent and deadly with this determination and intensity about him that seemed to keep the others here on their toes. Even her. And while she wouldn't go as far as to agree with Tumbler and Kip on the man being able to devour people with a well-placed glare . . . she knew without a doubt that if she didn't tread lightly and quickly that he could devour her heart and soul. What scared her, as she read her book and listened for the tell-tale sound of the Malibu, was that this knowledge didn't particularly bother her as badly as it should have. Sphinx parked the Malibu in front of Chaosia's garage, going to the front door and debated on knocking. She said she would be up reading and he had seen that her spot was in the back den. So what was the point in calling or texting and waiting to be let into the garage. This was just as efficient. But for some reason the act of knocking on her door was absurdly difficult. It didn't escape his notice that the act itself was significant. Lovers and boyfriends came to front doors to pick up said lovers and girlfriends . . . and while he wouldn't be adverse to the first option he wasn't used to being in any form of committed relationship. Especially this quickly. He never had been the type to openly admit to being exclusive or belonging to just one person. And the prospect, while appealing in its own right, had him a little weary. They needed to sort this out first and see what they wanted before setting anymore terms. But this still had him on edge. What if she took this wrong? Saw something there that wasn't and her feelings got hurt? And why the fuck did he care? But as he was pulling his phone out he realized that to text and ask to be let in through the garage, to effectively sneak into her house where others couldn't see him would be a slap in the face too. He might not want the young idiots to know every detail about whatever this was or to define it but he was in no way shape or form ashamed of it. He just wanted his privacy to protect her from the speculation that involving herself however she chose to would bring . . . He growled and shoved his phone back in his pocket, checking the time before knocking heavily on the door in a huff. And to think it had only taken him fifteen minutes to decide to knock. He heard shuffling as she came to the door and unlocked the deadbolt. But he wasn't prepared for the sight of her when the door finally opened. Dressed in those ripped cut offs she loved so much and a lacey pale aqua tank top with the afghan around her shoulders, Chaosia seemed to be more breathtaking than at the Anchor. Her freckles shown on her now darker skin and her hair seemed lighter from her time in the sun earlier in the week. She smiled at him, slipping her glasses into her curls as she stepped aside to let him in. He stepped into the house and waited at the entryway into the living room for her to shut the door and tend to the locks. He was suddenly glad she was so keen on locking everything as he heard the distant wail of sirens and looked down at her. He realized how fragile she was, despite her surprising ability to protect herself. She might hit as hard as any man but she was still so small and petite . . . and he was suddenly very angry at the turn in his thoughts. She'd proven herself not once but three times and he would be damned if he would act like some lovesick fool. She was a big girl and could defend herself. And had he not just been thinking that he wasn't ready to be this yet? She cleared her throat, bringing his attention to her as she stepped into him, pulling the afghan tighter around her shoulders. She looked up at him, almost touching him as she studied his face and the set of his shoulders. He sighed. She was too damned observant for him to be having a fit like this. And her words proved it. \"What's wrong, Chatterbox? Having second thoughts?\" He felt his face darken as her eyes seemed to lose some of their spark. She'd taken one look at him and known he was torn and that it was because of her. Was he really so transparent or was she just that damned smart? Finally after what seemed like an eternity she shrugged and stretched to her tiptoes, ghosting over his lips with her own before nodding her head towards the den. As she turned to walk away, he couldn't help himself. The thought of letting her step back from him and go even a few steps with that wounded look made his gut clench and his chest feel heavy. He caught her around the waist and spun her back into his chest, dipping his lips to hers with almost bruising force as he held her against hi,. It only took her a few seconds to melt against him and wrap her arms around his neck, the afghan falling to the floor around their feet. When they parted, he rubbed his cheek against hers. \"Not second thoughts girlie. Just trying to figure it out.\" She nodded, dipping to pick up the discarded blanket and led him to the den. Chaosia nervously watched Sphinx as he stood in the entryway to her den. She'd invited him to give them time to get to know each other and maybe explore some of their attraction to one another, seeing as in they'd really only been around each other at the garage most of the week they'd been official. But now that he was here, she was hard pressed to do anything but stare at him. She knew he was unconventionally handsome but he was definitely her type. And obviously had a brain beneath all of the brawn and brooding to be a fucking pathologist. He raised a brow at her as he stepped over to her reading chair, picking up the book and glancing at the title. She blushed, shrugging and stealing her book back as he chuckled and shook his head. So she was reading about a killer shark. Big deal. Sphinx went to sit on the love seat when she stopped him, pulling him back to the huge chair. She knew for fact that both of her parents could sit in the damned thing and still have room so there wasn't any reason to banish him to the other side of the room. \"You can sit with me if you want . . . it's warmer over here for some reason.\" He shrugged, shedding his coat and boots and sitting them beside the ottoman before sitting down in the huge chair. She knew she was blushing as she sat down beside him but she couldn't fight the warm feeling that spread through her when he pulled her closer. She sighed, snuggling into his side and reaching for the remote to turn on the TV when his hand caught hers. She looked up at him perplexed when he shrugged and motioned to her book. \"You were going to read before.\" She blinked. \"Yeah . . . but we can't both read and it's rude to ignore you so . . .\" He shrugged his brows, settling deeper into the seat before nodding to her. \"Go ahead and read girlie. I know I can't compete with your sharks.\" She smirked, grabbing the remote and hitting the power button before he could stop her. As the LCD came to life, she turned on the DVD player and hit play grinning like an idiot. \"Well, then we'll just both watch my sharks.\" He rolled his eyes as he saw that she had a Shark Week DVD in. Only her . He gave her a deadpan look as she started the Great White episode before shaking his head and pulling the blanket around them. She was right, though this spot was warmer this house stayed remarkably cool. As they watched the video, and Chaos kept up an almost constant narration of facts, he had to admit he was amazed to see the huge sharks actually launch themselves out of the water after birds. It gave him a new respect for the giant fish . . . and made him wonder about the dangers of Chaos actually being close to something that big and deadly. That the water couldn't apparently hold. He looked down, noticing she wasn't filling him in with tidbits of information anymore. Her head was tucked against his chest and she was sleeping soundly. He groaned. Now what was he supposed to do? He'd have to wake her up to let her walk him out and from the dark circles under eyes; she needed all the sleep she could get. He sighed, making the decision to settle in and stay the night. Besides . . . he was dead tired himself and what would it hurt to sleep in the huge and comfortable chair one night? She was his girlfriend after all. Sleep overs were allowed. He pulled her closer, settling back and letting the music and sounds of the ocean from the TV lull him to sleep. He never noticed how he pulled her closer or how she sighed contentedly when his fingers started playing in her curls. All he knew was that it was surprisingly peaceful to fall asleep with Chaos in his arms. Maybe, just maybe this wasn't going to be as horrible as he thought . . .[Chapter 17] Wake Up Call Someone was snickering above him. That's what had brought him back into consciousness, though he refused to open his eyes. He honestly couldn't remember where he was and what was going on . . . so until he did he would play dead so to speak. It had saved him a few times before so it was a good guess it wouldn't fail him now. Sphinx rolled a bit, feeling the weight on his chest and had to adjust to it. That's when it hit him. He'd stayed with Chaosia last night and they'd fallen asleep in the bloody chair in her den. The comfy bloody chair in her damned den . . . Well, that answered a few questions . . . but who the fuck was standing over them laughing? He listened; eyes still closed trying to see who was in Chaosia's house and what they wanted. \"Man, we've got to wake them up before Mom gets here, Bastian. If we don't, Rip will have hell to pay.\" A snort alerted Sphinx to the fact that there were indeed two of them and that both were male. What the fuck? \"Let them be, Mikhail. She looks exhausted besides . . . you know she doesn't sleep well when she's hurt. Mom won't be here for another half an hour so let them sleep. We came early remember?\" Sphinx snorted to himself, silently asking God what he'd done to deserve this. These two idiots had to be her oldest brothers. Lord what were they doing here? In Long Beach of all places? Chaosia shifting pulled his attention to her and he cracked an eye, watching her shift and cuddle closer to his chest before settling with a sleepy smile on her lips. He didn't know why but seeing that made the fact that he'd essentially been caught with his hand in the quintessential cookie jar almost worth it. She was content to be here and by God he'd let her . . . later. Right now he had to get up and stretch or his legs were going to fall off. He carefully stretched; causing both of their watchers to step back as he carefully slid out from under Chaosia's sleeping form. He waited, watching as she settled into the warmth he'd vacated before pulling the afghan back around her and brushed her hair out of her face. She sighed, burrowing down into the leather with a frown. She opened her eyes, obviously not awake. \"Sphinx? What's-\" He shushed her, rubbing her shoulder lightly as he whispered to her. \"Everything's fine, girlie. Just go back to sleep.\" She nodded and sighed, slipping back into unconsciousness before he turned to inspect her company. He'd been right the week before. Neither of her brothers favored her father as heavily as she did. Though technically only one of them would but still . . . Both shifted, instantly telling Sphinx more than anything they could say. He knew immediately which was which. The tallest had this stiff way of moving that reminded Sphinx of a member of the upper caste in London, meaning he had to be Bastian. The boy was well built, almost overly bulky with a larger frame than his brother. He apparently took after Eddie in the size department but other than that it was hard to see any resemblance at all. His dark eyes were a startling color, Sphinx had to admit. The boy's almost midnight blue irises seemed to hold this light to them that let you know he was always watching and judging. Sphinx logged that tidbit away, agreeing with Chaosia's earlier description when she'd talked of him. The boy screamed yuppie in his pressed khaki slacks and tight fitting blue polo shirt with loafers (of all things) but he doubted anyone ever told him that from the sheer size of him. He was almost eye level with the Sphinx himself after all. His wavy brown shoulder length hair held highlights of gold, copper, and honey and bronze that could only be natural while his skin has an allover permanent golden color, a few shades darker than Chaosia and his brother. The boy had a strong face with high sculpted cheekbones and a long straight nose . . . all gifts from his mother's mixed heritage if his girlfriend was to be believed. Sphinx sighed, turning to look at the other brother. This one seemed more at ease in his presence but Sphinx could still tell he was weary of the way he'd found them this morning. He was closer to Chaos than the other and seemed to have the innate ability to look like he was lounging even when he was standing, shifting from one foot to the other almost fluidly. Not quite as fluidly as his sister would have, but enough that it bore watching. Sphinx shook himself mentally. Mikhail would fit in great with the younger crew. He was probably Tumbler's height, falling a few inches short of Sphinx, and nowhere near as big as his brother. His frame was smaller, more compact and the boy looked lithe and wiry . . . but he could tell as he moved that though the muscle wasn't as obvious as it was with his sibling, it was there. Just compacted and toned instead of bulky. His black hair was short and gelled to pop up in different directions, almost like the boy had stuck his finger in a light socket to achieve the gravity defying style. His skin was as tanned as Chaosia's but his eyes . . . His eyes were a light blue violet color that seemed to constantly switch between the two . . . just like Chaosia's seemed to shift colors when she was nervous or angry. That was apparently a family thing, courtesy of their mother. He stepped forward, extending a hand to Sphinx to shake while the elder brother snorted, crossing his arms and glaring at the two of them. Sphinx shot the taller lad a dark look before taking the other's hand a giving a firm shake as he introduced himself and his practically sneering sibling. Oh that boy would be dead if he had to be around him too long. \"I'm Mikhail and the asshole casserole back there is Bastian. Don't let him bother you though. We all just ignore him most of the time. We're Ripley's brothers . . . and you are?\" Sphinx straightened to his full height and released his hand, trying not to grin wickedly as both boys noticed he was at least two inches taller than Bastian. \"Sphinx.\" Mikhail's face split into a grin as Bastian rolled his eyes. \"Oh. You're the one Pops was talking about. Cool. So . . . you know where she keeps the food in this icebox because I am about two seconds away from starving . . .\" Sphinx shook his head but showed them to the kitchen, Mikhail chatting away as they made their way. The boy talked almost as much as Chaos. And though his chatter was about completely different things, it was a terrifying thought in itself. Mikhail sat on the counter in Ripley's kitchen, smirking as he ate his bowl of cereal he'd scavenged from his sister's cabinets and watched Sphinx and Bastian glare at one another. Apparently his oh-so-lovable step brother hated the fact that their baby sister had already found someone to replace the douchebag from Seal Beach. Especially since he was bigger than both of them and they couldn't intimidate him into leaving their sister alone. Like we could if we wanted to . . . This guy seems intent to get exactly what he wants and how. I doubt even if we were bigger than him that we'd succeeded in running him off. He had to admit; the man was huge and had this presence to him that screamed to leave him the fuck alone. . . Which is probably why their Pops was so keen on him. If anyone could get a room of people to vanish and quick it was Eddie Guadimus in a sour mood. And this guy seemed right about two levels above Pops. Mikhail looked at Sphinx, trying to gauge the new addition to his sister's life. It was easy to see that from the less than ten words the man had spoken that he wasn't talkative (a trait he shared with Pops on most days) and that he was definitely British (another surprisingly shared trait). And by the way his eyes kept darting from Bastian's glare to the room that held their slumbering sister; it was very evident that he was just as worried about Chaos as they were. Bastian better just face it, we're probably looking at our future brother-in-law. Mikhail smirked again as Bastian rolled his eyes and growled, glaring at his phone when both of their cell phones went off at the same time. \"Hip Hop is Dead\" blared from his own pocket as \"Out of Exile\" screamed from Bastian's. They shared a look. This only meant one thing. Mom and Pops were inbound. And Pop was probably texting to stay sane while Mom was calling to chat and get the final verdict on Ripley's house. Sphinx raised a brow then shrugged, grabbing the carton of milk from the fridge and pouring himself a glass before turning to set up the coffee pot. Mikhail and Bastian shared another look, though this one was one of amazement rather than dread. The man was either intuitive or trying to earn brownie points with Ripley and Pops. He hadn't even known their baby sister a month and knew to set up the coffee pot? Bastian glared as he answered the phone, listening to Mom chatter away while Mikhail opened his own cell, glancing at the text from his poor stepfather. Warn your sister. Your mother is furious about the wound and wants to meet Sphinx. Mikhail's' brow rose as he looked up to see Bastian already staring at the Sphinx. To his credit, the man was just looking at both of them like they were crazy while he waited for the coffee to finish brewing. They both looked to each other. Mom wanted to meet Sphinx? What exactly was this guy to Ripley? And how the hell did their Mother figure it out before either one of them? Chaos woke up suddenly, sitting straight up from the chair as she heard a loud crash in her kitchen. Shit! What was that? She shot out of the arm chair and into the kitchen, screeching to a stop at the sight inside. Her brothers were here. And not just here but trying to maul each other in her kitchen as Sphinx stood to the side, drinking a cup of steaming coffee as he watched them. Ever so often, she would see him shake his head as he took a sip. Clearly, he wasn't going to stop this insanity any time soon. She growled, stalking into the room and grabbing each of her brothers by their respective ears. It was a low, dirty trick that only their mother used but it would have to do. She was just getting used to the damned house and they were not going to destroy it. Period. End of story. She jerked Bastian's ear as hard as she could, literally forcing him to stand on his tip toes as she pulled up. Mikhail got the opposite treatment as she wrenched his ear down and back. Bastian hissed through clenched teeth as Mikhail screamed, trying to run from the pain. Which only ended up with him jerking back when she wouldn't let him go. Sphinx was shaking from his spot near the counter, barely concealing the laughter that was threatening to spill forth. Chaos grumbled, jerking both of her brothers again. \"What in the high hell are you two idiots doing? Trying to redecorate my kitchen with each other's entrails?\" As they both went to answer, she jerked again, refusing to flinch the loud pop sound both of their heads made when they collided. It wasn't like their skulls weren't thick enough to handle the hit. Lord knows they were. \"Nope. Don't say it. I don't care what started or who. I'm finishing it. Now, what are you rejects doing here?\" Mikhail wrenched away, rubbing his now purple ear as Chaos let Bastian go. The eldest brother dropped to the ground, flopping on his back and groaning as he held his head. Chaos rolled her eyes. Fucking drama queens the both of them. \"Well? I'm waiting.\" \"We're here today with Mom, remember? You know she was supposed to come today and see the house and you guys were supposed to go shopping or some girlie shit. We're here as atonement for the damned car. Pops orders.\" Chaos eyed Mikhail suspiciously before her face drained of color. Bastian growled as he pulled himself up. \"Oh great, now she remembers. You're about as flighty as Dad, Chaosia. I swear. Speaking of which, they'll be here any minute . . . so I'd go get dressed if I were you.\" She groaned, turning to Sphinx. He shrugged passing her a fresh cup of coffee before pushing away from the counter. He stopped long enough to shake his head at both boys, a dark grin on his lips, before heading towards the den. Effectively leaving her alone with the two idiots. Traitor. Mikhail came up beside her, stealing a drink of her coffee and nodding thoughtfully. He eyed her moment before smirking and wrapping an arm around her shoulders. \"Look at it this way, Sis. At least he makes a good cup of coffee.\" Bastian smirked, still rubbing his sore ear as he settled in on the other side of her, propping against the counter as he reached and stole a drink from her as well. What was it about these two that they were always stealing her food? \"And a good bed, too. Apparently.\" Chaos stopped, her whole face flushing a bright red as Bastian's words registered. Oh God, they hadn't . . . She looked, seeing both of her brothers wearing shit eating grins, making her blush increase tenfold. They had. She pushed away, taking her cup with her as they erupted into loud, joyous laughter at her expense. Fucking turncoats could get their own damned cups. She stormed out of the kitchen, barely missing Sphinx who was coming back in with his own empty cup. He caught her, steadying her as she almost toppled. She sighed, glaring at her still laughing brothers in the other room. \"I am going to kill them. Slowly and painfully.\" Sphinx chuckled, dipping to press his lips against hers quickly before shaking his head and stepping around into the kitchen. \"Go get dressed, girlie. I'll make sure they don't kill your house.\" She nodded, breathing deeply before shooting away and up the stairs. God she had to find something to wear that wouldn't have her mother in full blown suspicious mode . . . without putting on sweats and a holey tee shirt. She sighed, slipping in her bedroom. Why did they have to come today?[Chapter 18] Killjoy Chaosia quickly started sorting through her closet, tossing seemingly random articles of clothing over her shoulder as she tried to find something to wear. Dear God there had to be something in all of this mess . . . Any other day, she could just grab a pair of jeans and a shirt, throw on her sandals and be done with it. But oh no. Not today. Not with both of her parents en route . . . She had to find something girlie enough to soothe her mother's constant irritation with her tomboyish beach bum ways . . . and conservative enough to appease her father's wishes. Wishes that she'd normally rank over her mother's. But today, with Sphinx here, she would do anything in her power to ensure that her mother didn't automatically decide he was a bad influence . . . even if it meant wearing one of the items hidden deeper in her closet. She sighed, shoulders drooping as she made up her mind to venture into the back portion of the walk-in that housed the skirts and dressier, trendy clothing her mother and aunts insisted on buying her. She growled. Why was she acting like it was the end of the world that she was going to put on a damned skirt? It wasn't! Besides, her brothers always shut the fuck up when she dressed more like a girl . . . they were too busy trying to fight off every guy who looked at her for over two seconds to bother with aggravating her and abusing her. She smirked. Hell, she might even put on make-up. Just to see what the two idiots would do. And if it made her mother more receptive of her stoic giant drinking coffee in her living room . . . it wouldn't be too bad. She pulled a hanging garment bag, with an acrylic shoe tote and accessory baggie attached, tossing it on her bed as she stepped out of the closet. She opened the bag, shaking her head. Her father would flip over the skirt but her mother would love it . . . The by-hand destruction on the vintage washed denim mini was the epitome of beach casual, with heavy fading towards the unfinished cut-off hem. But what made the skirt unique from all of the others she'd seen around both Long and Seal Beach (and what had probably prompted her mother to spend such an absorbent amount on it in the first place) was the dark chambray ruffled lining at hem, adding an extra inch to the skirt. She pulled the skirt on, smoothing it down over her hips before grabbing the heather oatmeal lacey tank top and pulling it over her head. The cross-over sweetheart neckline was enough to look dressy without being overly so. Chaosia tugged the shirt straight, admiring the beautiful lace detailing around the neckline and the hem. The navy cotton knit cardigan with vintage buttons, and a very beautiful cloth rosette embellishment cluster around the left side of the neck line, would go well over the tank without being too formal or stuffy. Or hot, for that matter. She shrugged, pulling the cardigan on before sitting on the edge of the bed to slide on the sandals that matched the outfit. She would have to remember to send Paul a candy arrangement for suggesting to match the outfits and put them in garment bags for safe keeping and quick picking. He really did have the best ideas . . . for someone who could act as brainless as her brothers. The polka dotted silk and leather gladiator sandals were cute. The silk ribbons and leather straps criss-crossed over the tops of her feet with a thick leather cuff that circled her ankles, though it was still easy to see the etched detailing and metal stud embellishments on the leather straps. She nodded, admiring the shoes before she stood and turned to go into the bathroom. She pulled on the long dainty necklace and slipped it over her head. The delicate strands of silver seemed to bloom with sheer organza petals of turquoise and cream, with a myriad tiny facets of crystal inter woven, all leading down to a vintage bronze key. Chaosia quickly ran her fingers through her curls, taming it into a manageable style before putting clear gloss on and deciding that was enough. She was giving her appearance a once over in the mirror when she heard the door open and shut. She turned, spotting Sphinx as he walked into the bathroom. When did he come in? He crossed the vast space, stopping in front of her to reach down and cup her cheek. She leaned into the contact, thankful of the support. \"They just pulled up, Love. So we'd better hurry.\" She nodded, going to move around him. \"Okay, I'm done-\" She never got to finish as his lips slashed against hers, taking her breath away. His arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her into him as he started moving them steadily back and into the vanity. In one deft movement, he had her up and on the countertop, situating himself between her bare legs. As he kissed her, she felt the evidence of just how much he liked the skirt . . . maybe she'd have to start wearing them more often . . . Suddenly, he pulled back, bracing himself with a hand against her mirror as he pressed his forehead to hers. He groaned as she moved, creating a wonderful friction. His hand shot to her waist, holding her still. \"Girl, stop . . . or we aren't going to be doing anything but crawling in that bed and fucking until Monday. Shopping and shark expeditions be damned.\" She pouted, but nodded, letting him pull her off the vanity and steady her on her feet. He kissed her again, this time softly like he had in the kitchen the week prior. \"I swear when their gone we'll finish this. But the first time is not going to be on your vanity with your parents just downstairs.\" She groaned, kissing him back. \"Fine, killjoy. But you are so making that up to me. Especially since you started it.\" Its short and sweet and steamy but it'll hold you over until I can finish the next chapter . . . and the revision is now complete! WHAHAHAHAHAHA! I expanded an eleven chapter story into seventeen! Aren't I awesome? Please don't answer that. Later.[Chapter 19] I am so sure that all of my readers about to stoke. I've updated like all of my stories but lie two today . . . so yeah. I'm on a roll. Okay. Dork moment over, on with the show. Meeting Millennia Sphinx was sure that the man standing ever-so-slightly behind the woman surveying Chaosia's den was not the same man he'd met before. That man had been all smiles and good humor, playfully bantering with his daughter with a wicked gleam in his eye . . . all the while the epitome of causal in his jeans and tee shirt . . . but this man . . . he was almost terrifying. Why? Because if he was acting like this then this woman was Satan incarnate. Eddie Guadimus stood with what Sphinx could only surmise was his wife, casting cautioned glances between himself and the two sulking boys beside him . . . all the while never moving enough to draw too much attention to himself as he edged closer and closer to the front door he'd come in through. The boys had yet to catch on to what he was doing but Sphinx had noticed the slowly widening space with the man's second step. And Eddie himself was so focused on his task of escaping that he'd yet to even register the two sets of ever-watchful eyes . . . Because his wife was not as oblivious as he thought. Finally, the tell-tale sound of footsteps brought all of their heads towards the stairs. As Chaosia descended in that tiny little skirt and those damned shoes he didn't know whether to be crow or moan. The skirt was definitely something new for his girl, something he hadn't really seen her in before (with the exception of the red dress) . . . and those damned shoes didn't do anything but showcase her long legs . . . He'd thought the heels and boots were bad . . . Apparently, Chaosia barefoot was about the only way to not draw his attention to her legs. She stepped into the room, forcing a bright smile as she crossed to her mother. The closer she got, the more enraptured Sphinx became. He hadn't really taken much notice of the elder woman to be truthful. He'd noticed her and the location she held in the room but other than that, he was far too focused on Eddie's failed escape attempt and trying to forget what had almost happened upstairs . . . Hell, just thinking about it in passing this second was enough to make him want to run these people out of the damned house and make good on his threat. He shook himself, forcing his mind away from before and to focusing on the similarities between the two women. Chaosia's mother was without a doubt one of the most stunning women he'd ever seen before in his life. It was easy to overlook her with the towering males she'd surrounded herself with but beside her slightly shorter daughter . . . no one would ever be able to miss her. Her ink black curls fell around a face very similar to her daughter's, swept to the side and just shy of falling into vibrant blue swirled with lavender eyes. So similar that save slightly higher cheekbones and a more defined nose, it would be easy to mistake one for the other. Even with the obvious differences. Her peach colored lips spread into a warm smile as she pulled her daughter into a hug, their curls mixing and mingling as they talked and laughed . . . the tension easing from Chaos's shoulder a bit more with every second her mother held her. As Chaos stepped to the side, still under her mother's arm, Sphinx noticed that while tanned from her time in the sun, she was nowhere near as dark as her mother's glowing honeydew. She turned her eyes to him, smiling as she pulled her mother with her for the introduction she'd been fretting about earlier. He actually had to refrain from smirking at her when some of the hesitation seeped back into her sea glass eyes. Honestly, this woman couldn't possibly be so bad, right? She was related to Junie for Christ's sake. How terrifying could she possibly be . . . \"Mom, this is Sphinx.\" She gave him a small smirk, before turning to look back at her mother. A warning akin to the one she'd issued her father was present as she openly glared at her now smirking mother as she eyed him with open mirth and skepticism. Sphinx suddenly had to quell the desire to step back as the brothers groaned from their spot near the stairs. \"Sphinx, this is my mother . . . Millennia Guadimus.\" Millennia extended her hand, smirk still in place as he stepped forward to take it. \"Sphinx, hmm? What an intriguing name to call oneself . . . Any particular reason or did you just think it sounded cool?\" Sphinx blinked before he chuckled, pulling her hand to his lips and ghosting a very proper kiss across her knuckles. He knew how to play this game . . . \"My brother used to swear it was easier to get answers from the Sphinx and it stuck . . . Especially after the tattoo on my back . . . A pleasure to meet you, Miss Guadimus. Chaosia has spoken very highly of you.\" It was oh so easy to see where Chaosia had gotten her courage and biting wit from . . . and it most definitely was not her father. Millennia seemed stunned that he laughed at her thinly veiled jab . . . before her lips spread into a truly warm and inviting smile. The boys behind him seemed stunned as their mother threw her head back and laughed, turning to her gaping daughter. \"Oh honey, he's a riot . . .\" Millennia turned, looking back at Sphinx warmly as she reached out and patted his chest like she would've any of her sons. Because now that she's seen him, and seen he wasn't going to let her run all over him the way Marcello-and any boy her daughter had ever brought home- did, then she really didn't have that much of an issue with her daughter seeing him. Even with the obvious age difference. \"Welcome to the family, honey . . . Too bad we're all crazy.\" The towering man nodded, glancing back at her daughter with a smug smirk that could only be described as self-satisfied. Chaos, however, just kept looking at her . . . eyes narrowed as she watched for any signs that this was some big trick. Millennia sighed, shaking her head and pulling Chaos tighter against her, dropping a kiss on her bangs. Her daughter needed to lighten up . . . she was almost as paranoid as her bloody father. Speaking of which . . . \"Edward? Are you going to quit trying to escape and come be sociable or am I going to have to come and get you?\" She heard the muttered curses, both British and American as he slunk up to her other side. She didn't need to look up to know he was looking beseechingly down at Chaosia while she looked up perplexed at him. She sighed again, rolling her eyes before looking to her sons. They were both still looking at the new addition to their sister's life . . . though Bastian looked about ready to murder. And with everything that had happed with Yvonne and Marcello. . . she couldn't really blame him. Her sons wasn't going to let anyone new around his baby sister for a very long time. And unfortunately for Sphinx, that meant him as well. Mikhail however seemed pretty intent on just being as friendly as possible, practically bouncing from foot to foot in a poorly concealed effort to keep the million questions at bay. She knew once the thrill wore off he'd mellow back out but her son and daughter were both jitterbugs when they were excited. And nothing-save boosting and Monique- excited him more than an opportunity to harass Chaosia and Bastian. Millennia turned, smirking at her husband as he fidgeted and tried to not look guilty. He still thought he was dog meat about not telling her he'd met Sphinx before Junie mentioned it in passing. Her smirk darkened, causing him to gulp and Sphinx to raise a brow as her sons groaned. They were all in trouble . . . they just didn't know it yet. But first, she wanted some time alone with her daughter. And not crowded by these testosterone fueled behemoths. \"Actually . . . why don't you boys go ahead to Otto's?\" The boys perked as Ed eyes took on the same paranoid and skeptical glint Chaosia's had moments before. They were both so damned paranoid . . . \"Why? You planning on refurnishing the house with the damned cards because you're mad again? Because I'm not parting with any of the furniture this time, Millennia. I swear it.\" Bastian shook his head, cursing silently as his father opened his damn mouth. Why couldn't he just of taken the out? But no, he had to go and start a damn fight . . . Thankfully, his mother wasn't falling for it. She leveled a deadpan look on him before turning to look at Chaos, completely ignoring her husband. \"I was just suggesting that all of you go and do something you'd enjoy. Lord knows its been forever since you've seen Otto . . . and Junie is already going shopping with Chaosia and me. Unless you want to go with us . . .\" \"NO!\" Twin shouts brought his mother's eyes to both of them . . . and Bastian felt the warmth spread through his cheeks as he and Mikhail both ducked their heads. He hadn't been able to stop the response from escaping his lips . . . and apparently Khail hadn't either. Mikhail however, was already on point, looking up at Dad with the biggest, saddest eyes he could muster. \"Please Pops . . . I haven't seen Uncle Otto in like literally forever . . . and you know we hate the mall. I don't even go with Monique . . . Please can we go to the shop?\" Bastian rolled his eyes but was secretly thankful Khail wasn't too proud to beg to get what he wanted. Or result to terror tactics. They all knew Khail and Ripley's secret weapon of the eyes always got them whatever they wanted. Especially on the rare occasions that they'd tag-team him. Dad sighed, nodding like he was consenting to some great travesty . . . before his eyes shot to the stoic man that had been watching all of this with a smirk. Bastian glared as he saw where his father's gaze had landed . . . and almost spit fire when he heard the words that spilled from his mouth. \"Well, boy-o . . . you tagging along?\" Bastian's eyes narrowed as the hulking man shrugged, nodding once. He watched the Sphinx look down to Chaos, nodding once to her as she shrugged. \"Go ahead if you want. I doubt us at the mall will interest you anymore than it would them . . .Just . . . don't kill them okay? They're crazy but they're mine.\" Sphinx chuckled, nodding to her before he dipped and kissed her cheek. Bastian saw his lips move but for the life of him he couldn't hear what he whispered . . . and apparently neither could Dad or Khail. But the look on their sister's face, as she blushed and rolled her eyes at him before pressing a quick kiss to the corner of his lips, and their mother's knowing smile told them it probably wasn't something he should have. Oh this guy was something else. And now, thanks to their loving and adoring mother they had to spend the rest of the day with him. This was going to be worse than shopping. Yeah, that's about something retarded that my dad would really do and say . . . poor, poor men.[Chapter 20] I know, i know. I've been kind of lax here . . . but with the turn that the Coffee universe took I had to work it out before I could give Learning Curve the attention it needed . . . which i will hopefully get to now. Hope you enjoy it . . . Little Shop of Horrors Chaosia had watched the men in her life waltz out the front door of the house she'd been slowly making home since she'd relocated to Long Beach . . . and had to wonder just how many of them would come back breathing. If any of them. She'd seen the look cross Bastian's face when her mother hadn't freaked over Sphinx's presence. And watched it practically sour when their father had invited him to tag along on their sudden 'get-out-of-shopping-hell-free\" excursion to the garage. She sighed, turning back to eye her mother as she settled into the overstuffed curved sofa with a knowing smirk spread across her lips. Chaosia cringed, knowing that particular smirk didn't bode well for her now that the others were gone. She turned, hoping to scurry into the kitchen before she got stuck . . . \"Chaosia Ripley, do not even think about trying to escape. We have an hour before we have to get Junie . . . and you and I are going to have nice heart-to-heart over that man that just left. Starting with what he was doing here so damn early in the day.\" Chaosia sighed, shoulders sagging as she turned and trudged back to the couch like she was marching to the gallows. Because that was exactly what she was doing. Her mother might've seemed fine with the pop-up appearance her new boyfriend had made . . . but she'd known the second the boys had been dismissed this was coming. Because Millennia Guadimus was not the type of woman to let anything go . . . She flopped unceremoniously onto the couch, crossing her arms as she looked towards her foiled escape route while she crossed her legs and slouched into the plush seat. Her mother-however-was not impressed. She merely shook her head and reached out, brushing her curls out of her face. Smirking knowingly down at her the whole time . . . God she was doomed . . . Millennia sighed as she watched her daughter pout; trying not to laugh at the uncanny resemblance she bore to her father as she slouched into the sofa beside her. There were days she wondered if her daughter had taken after her any at all because-other than their obvious physical similarities-her wayward and spastic child was all her father. Both were so zealous about doing what they wanted-no matter the consequences- that she'd spent the majority of Chaosia's childhood trying to ensure she didn't get into a brawl every five seconds, set something aflame or pull some ludicrous prank that happened to be a felony (which she'd very narrowly avoided a few times). And therein lay the problem with what she'd walked in on . . . While she knew that her daughter did take after her in some ways (her recent tastes in men finally proving it) Chaosia was for intents and purposes a carbon copy of her Eddie . . . and she wasn't going to listen to a damn thing anyone had to say to her about how she needed to be careful. While Chaosia had proved with Marcello that she wasn't as untouchable as they all thought she was-though honestly none of them had seen that bomb being dropped until they were sifting through the wreckage- she would be more likely to blunder on through another bad decision just to prove she would survive it. Especially if they tried to push her. She needed to do this carefully . . . \"I am not going to rant and rail at you for dating him, Chaosia . . . Even though I do remember asking you to talk to me or your father before you let anything get too serious . . .\" Her daughter's head shot up, eyes narrowed as she looked her over skeptically. But she'd seen the flash of righteous indignation at the little barb . . . and knew with her words that Chaosia had actually done as she was told-for once . . . but that it was probably only by a mere coincidence. \"I haven't slept with him, Mother . . . Seriously; do all of you think I just hop in bed with every tall, dark and emotionally retarded behemoth I see? That's kind of insulting . . . we've only been dating a week . . .\" Millennia gave her a deadpan look, knowing full well that the timeframe didn't make a damn bit of difference to either of them . . . and that her daughter had just tossed it out to try and get in her own little dig. Further proof of how deep she was into this fledgling relationship . . . She sighed. At least this one wasn't likely to fuck Bastian's new girlfriend . . . when he got a new one. \"Oh seriously, Chaosia. I am not as old fashioned as you think . . . I was at Woodstock for Christ's sakes! I just want you to be careful. Marcello did a lot of damage . . . and not just with your brother. Who is not thrilled you're dating again if you didn't notice . . .\" Chaosia nodded, slumping further into her seat and looking thoroughly chastised. Leaving Millennia to shake her head as she pulled her into her side, running her fingers through her daughter's unruly curls. God this child would be the death of her . . . \"Yeah I got that . . . He won't do anything to try and scare him off, right? I mean, it took me way to much freaking effort for Bastian and Mikhail to mess this up . . .\" Millennia raised a brow, intrigued at that particular piece of information. Her daughter had dated off-and-on sporadically while she was in Seal Beach but somehow always managing to remain friendly with her exes. She'd never had to do much more than smile prettily at whatever poor sap she wanted to get her way. Hell, even Marcello had fallen at her feet just like any other person she'd ever shown interest in. This was interesting . . . and far too good an opportunity to harass her daughter to pass up. Fox was the conceited one . . . but hearing the charming young man that had just left actually had enough backbone to not cower to her headstrong daughter just because she was attractive was promising beyond belief. No wonder Eddie hadn't wanted her involved until now . . . \"Oh really? You mean he didn't just pant at your feet like every other idiot you ever brought home? He actually made you work to gain his attention like every other woman on the planet? Poor baby . . .\" Chaosia rolled her eyes and stuck her tongue out her, making Millennia laugh and ruffle her hair as she cooed at her. \"Ha ha, Mother . . . It isn't like that . . . He's just . . . different . . .\" Millennia nodded, standing and stretching before she smoothed her scoop necked black jersey sweater out and over her wide legged seer sucker trousers. She'd known they were mall bound and dressed appropriately . . . even donning black flip flops for the sake of her poor feet. Her back popped and she sighed, reaching up to fluff her black waves before nodding towards the kitchen. \"Oh I gathered as much, darling. But he seems nice enough . . . Let's see if he can brew decent coffee before we go collect Junie. And then we'll go and see if your father's credit cards have limits. Do you still need patio furniture?\" Sphinx watched the crew and Eddie Guadimus interact like he was sure people watched train wrecks. It was a harrowing and scarring experience but no matter how badly anyone wanted to, they couldn't look away . . . And that's about where he was mentally as he watched Atley grin at Eddie, going on and on about how nice it was to finally meet Chaosia's father. Sphinx snorted, turning just in time to see Mikhail-who was by far the more tolerable of Chaosia's brothers-raise a skeptical brow at Mirror and Toby as they assured him they could open the locks to the gleaming Escalade the boy had driven without ever popping the window seal or touching the door itself. The boy seemed eager to learn, watching enthralled as Toby ran the frequency scanner close to the lock before grinning as it beeped; displaying the proper code and wave for the dummy fob to emit. He grinned; the lads had worked hard on that little contraption and it had served them well over the past few years . . . and apparently made the shy hacker a new friend from the gleam in Mikhail's eyes. The visiting boost nodded appreciatively before turning and waving to Tumbler and Kip as they made their way back in; cases of beer in hand. As Tumbler tossed Mikhail a beer-the younger crew awed as he caught it deftly, twirling it around his wrist and fingers by the bottle neck before popping the top on the closest workbench and nodding his thanks- he knew he'd been right. Mikhail Shaw was right at home in Otto's with the others . . . But the casual conversation he kept with Memphis had him wondering if he'd be just as at peace with the Old School. The boy wasn't like his brother . . . or the jumping, excited spaz that had woken him up this morning for that matter. He was relaxed and confident without being arrogant. Something Bastian was the exact opposite of. The oldest brother was talking quietly with Otto and Donnie, nodding ever-so-often and letting a small smile grace his lips before it would fall. Sphinx snorted, rolling his eyes as he turned to watch the younger crew again. He had no clue what the boy's deal was but he needed to pull the stick from his ass . . . He accepted the beer Tumbler handed him as Eddie came up beside him, nodding to the entrance as he pulled a pack of clove cigars from his jacket pocket. Sphinx nodded to Tumbler, going with the elder boost. Eddie moved, letting him out before he slid the massive door shut and shook his head with a groan. He then rolled his eyes and pulled a cigar from the pack, holding it between his teeth as he extended the pack to Sphinx. He shrugged, accepting the cigar before crossing to the decaying picnic tables and sinking to the bench as Eddie followed. It might not be the most comfortable seat but it beat being inside . . . and was far enough away from the others that any conversation they had wouldn't be easily spied on . . . Eddie tossed him the lighter, sinking onto the table top beside him as he took long pulls from the cigar. Finally, as he caught the lighter Sphinx tossed back to him, the visiting runner spoke. And proved he was just as good at noticing things as his daughter . . . A good piece of information to log away. \"I know Bastian seems a bit stiff . . . but he's really not that bad. I know I'm a bit biased but I can't help it . . . He's my son. And he's been dealt a hell of a blow over the past few months . . . So don't let the way he's bound to act with you completely influence your decision about him.\" Sphinx raised a brow, tapping the building ash from his own cigar as he turned to look up at his girlfriend's father. He was pretty much voicing what Sphinx had already put together: Bastian would prove to be an obstacle-no matter how small or far away-in his relationship with Chaosia . . . and while the man knew it wasn't justified he was asking him to reserve judgment. But why? \"Can't promise anything if I don't know everything . . . What's his deal, then?\" Eddie sighed, looking down at the man that reminded him so severely of his own brother it was frightening. Topher and the man before him didn't favor much physically . . . Actually, other than both of them being well over six feet and seemingly forged of black ice, hellfire and brimstone he'd have never even considered his own relation back in London. But their attitude is where the similarity was. Top was quiet and reserved, never speaking unless he knew what and how he was going to say . . . and he was just as severe as the man before him; if not more so. And while he knew that was a good bit of what made him take a liking to the man staring up at him expectantly, he knew-from what he'd seen and heard both for himself and from Otto- that he would've liked the kid anyway. And though he would've never guessed his baby girl would be with anyone even close to this man he'd recognized the look she'd been giving him in when they'd met. His little girl wanted this brooding man and he would see to it that nothing would stand in the way of that. Because he knew the man had to be better than the little piss ant that had almost torn his family apart. And he looked at his daughter the same way she looked at him . . . and she could definitely do much worse. He sighed, taking a long drag from his cigar before he nodded to Sphinx. \"Bastian was supposed to be getting married soon. Had dated the girl for years . . . and known her even longer. So when she started flaking on the big shit they needed to do for their ceremony we all got worried. Millie and Chaos had never cared for her . . . and it turned out they had reason. Bastian and Chaosia caught Yvonne in bed with another man two months before their wedding day.\" Sphinx blinked, frowning as he shook his head. Eddie could see that that piece of information didn't sit well with his girl's brooding beau . . . but he knew for fact that the next shock would be a big one. \"Bloody hell. He still breathing? Because I know Chaosia probably gutted him on the spot . . .\" Eddie felt his own face darken as he shook his head, hating the fact that the little shit wasn't rotting in a shallow grave somewhere. If he'd had it his way he would've been . . . but he couldn't get away wth shit here like he did across the pond. Unfortunately. \"I wish that were the case but as it stands I'm paying to repair or replace the little ass's car . . . Because my sons decided to listen to the drunken raving of their heart broken sister and act on it . . .\" He watched the information process and knew from the dark look on the other man's face that he'd connected the dots. He growled before taking a long drink of his neglected beer, draining it one go before tossing the empty bottle into the nearby bin. He stood, cracking his neck from side to side before he nodded to Guadimus and extended a hand to the other man. \"I get it . . . but if that fucking bastard ever crosses my path, he's a dead man.\" Eddie grinned darkly, nodding as he took the proffered hand and shook it hard before letting the younger boost pull him to his feet. He knew he'd liked this man . . . and now that he was sure he'd be tolerant of Bastian's pissiness he could breathe easier. Now he just had to worry about him skinning Mikhail alive if he got too hyper . . . Mikhail watched his Pops and the newest addition to his sister's life disappear out the front of the garage as he took a gulp of his beer. He was glad that Pops liked him . . . and knew how much easier that would make this for Ripley. He wasn't however just going to hand over his sister to just anyone. No matter how much she liked him. He'd fallen lax with Marcello and look at where it'd gotten them. He turned, looking over Tumbler and Mirror as they talked while Toby typed away silently on his laptop. He liked this crew . . . they were no where near as big or as stuffy as his Pops . . . or Uncle Ed's. And he could see his sister would be well taken care of if she stayed here. Not to mention entertained . . . but he needed to know about this guy before he gave him the official Big Brother Seal of Approval. He nudged Tumbler, pulling the blonde boost from his conversation. \"So what's up with him? He always this pleasant?\" Tumbler grinned as Mirror groaned, stepping forward to share his experiences with the older runner as Kip and Toby shook their heads. \"Are you kidding? This is friendly compared to the way he normally acts . . . Which is batshit crazy before you ask.\" Mikhail raised a brow, leaning in closer. \"Oh? Like how?\" Tumbler snorted, rolling his eyes before smirking again. It was pretty obvious that this guy's opinion of the other was mixed . . . but Mirror seemed pretty set on him being some sort of closet hatchet murder or something . . . Just who the hell had his sister gotten into bed with? \"Like he practically ignores your sister until he sees someone else is interested and then freaks out. Practically tossed me across the room for giving her a hug!\" Mirror nodded, pointing to Kip. \"And he totally almost killed me for that prank! I mean it wasn't even that bad!\" Toby and Kip shared a look before rolling their eyes, the blonde hacker voicing their common thought. \"Uh, Mirror dude? You sprayed the Old School with high pressurized blue water . . . and soaked them to the bone. They all wanted to kill you. Sphinx just got to you first . . . Besides you always aggravate him and you got away. And Tumbler, Atley told you to leave Chaosia alone . . . She was seeing someone and you were laying it on thick . . .\" Tumbler shrugged, taking a drink of his beer as he didn't deny the fact. But Mirror seemed intent on making Mikhail see how bad Sphinx could be . . . \"Okay well what about the whole snake thing, huh? I mean seriously. The duded rams those cops down a ramp before he grabs this snake and tosses it out of the window . . . and just acts like nothing was wrong! That's fucking crazy!\" Mikhail blinked before he erupted into peels of laughter. As Pops and Sphinx stepped back inside, he had to clutch his sides and the counter to keep from falling to the ground. He looked up to the others, waving his worried stepfather off as the two older boosts came to see what was wrong. But he couldn't stop himself from looking at the stoic man and laughing even harder. Finally, Pops got fed up with it enough that he snapped; drawing all of the others' attention. \"Jesus Mikhail! What is so bloody funny?\" He straightened, fighting his laughter long enough to clap the now shocked runner on the shoulder, pulling the larger and brooding man into a tight hug as he tried not to bust out laughing again. But this time at the look on all of their faces. He was so moving to Long Beach . . . it was way to boring at home without his sister. He pulled back, patting the Sphinx's arm hard as he turned to Pops and shrugged before shooting over to Bastian to avoid the deadly look darkening both of the men's faces. This guy was perfect for his sister . . . Some humor seeing as how my other story has gotten kind of dark . . .[Chapter 21] Hello! Unfortunately this is an author's note and not a chapter . . . But I needed to let my readers know that updates may be scant for a few months. Since the end of January we've been in and out of the hospital with my father. And while the last few chapters of Coffee and HMWYBS have been drafted and written there with what we're going to be doing with my Dad there might be a lull. He's been diagnosed with end stage liver disease and we're in the testing process to see if either myself or my sister are viable donors for a live transplant. This doesn't mean I'm abandoning these stories-far from it, they're probably going to be one of the few things keeping me sane. But there might be a few extra days between updates. Or maybe not, so we're just going to wait and see. And for the people who have read and responded to Summer, I thank you. That's the new 'keep the oldest sane and from killing doctors' dumping ground. But its fun to write . . . and its growing faster than even Coffee or Learning Curve did. But its also the second basis i played with for Gone in 60 Seconds so . . . it's been jumping around in my head for a while. And- if the hospitalist yells at me for smoking again it will probably see more updates than the others . . . Anyway . . . Thank you all . . . Chaos[Chapter 22] See! I haven't abandoned it I swear! I know its been so long since an update here so feel free to re-read the last few chapters if you need a refresher. Thanks so much to everyone who's helped keep me motivated with this story. Its great to see other people enjoy other aspects of my insanity than what we see in Coffee and Summer. Alright boys and girls. On with the show. Thankful Departures Chaosia rolled her eyes as she followed Junie and her mother into the shop, trying to balance the millions of bags they'd managed to load her down with. Not that they were any better off . . . Junie had probably gotten an entirely new wardrobe to go along with all of the new shoes and jewelry her mother had picked out for her. And poor Otto was going to have to sacrifice even more of his coveted closet space to accommodate it. She grumbled, shifting the heavier bags again until she saw the back of a very familiar head. She glanced around before she finally shrugged. She could at least deal with the idiot for a few moments . . . regardless of how aggravating he was being today. She reached out, tapping her eldest brother on the shoulder as much as she could. And when he turned he raised a brow before shaking his head, taking as many of the bags from her hands as he could. Which was both a blessing and a curse because the second her now numb fingers were free they started to itch and burn. Meaning they were trying to come back to life on her. She growled, dropping the rest of the bags at her feet unceremoniously before shaking her now aching fingers to try and get the pinprick sensation to dissipate. Bastian just looked at all of the bags, shaking his head again as he chided her. \"Mom is going to be pissed at you for dropping all of those on the ground you know.\" She huffed, rolling her eyes as she rubbed her almost fully restored digits; grumbling as she glared down at the bags she'd been lugging all over most of Long Beach and Los Angeles. Like she really cared if the gossiping harpy she called a mother was upset with her. Not after all of the little digs and whispers she and Junie had gotten in. And to think she'd sacrificed a full month of her life to help Junie out by organizing that damned office! \"Then she shouldn't have bought the whole damned mall all at once. I swear between the three of us there isn't anything left. In any of the stores or on Daddy's credit cards. Besides these are mine anyway . . . well, most of them.\" Bastian glanced at the bags before looking up at her perplexed. And she suddenly had to fight the urge to roll her eyes as his face fell back into the same sour look. Honestly he'd been texting her most of the day, asking her if she was insane or sure about this new romance. Why did everyone act like she was running off to the alter with Sphinx? They'd seriously only been together a week! She hadn't slept with him-hell the little show on her vanity was the closest they'd gotten by far- and she wasn't asking him to move in or rearranging her whole life for him. And what in the fuck was he going on about now? \"Mom made you buy clothes? Why? She hates to clothes shop with you . . . You're too much like Dad.\" She looked at him like he was crazy before reaching out and smacking him in the shoulder hard. Which caused him to flinch and drop every single bag he'd taken from her with a loud yelp. She growled, smacking him again as she noticed the huge dirt marks on the outside of the whitest bags. \"Gee! Thanks for dropping it in the one patch of dirt asshole! Now I have to listen to Mom about how everything's dirty. Awesome.\" He glared at her, shoving her a little harder than he normally would as he got down in her face. But it didn't faze her in the least. They'd always bickered and fought like this . . . and so long as her new boyfriend or her father didn't catch them then she was cool with throwing down with him if it came to it. Besides he deserved it for being a jerk while she was gone. \"You threw yours down on the freaking ground, Chaosia. And I only dropped them because you hit me. And why did you hit me, you brat?\" She rolled her eyes, pointing to her still standing bags and the ones he'd tossed. Hers were upright while the clothes and shoes were dangerously close to pouring out of his . . . and it looked like the new cream cashmere blouse her mother had gotten her was about to touch a spot of oil. She reached down, sitting the bags up as she groused at him; smacking his hands away as he tried to help her. God why was he being so damned weird? \"Uh I didn't almost dump out the clothes, asshole. You did. And I hit you because you were being a jerk. As usual. What's your fucking issue today?\" He growled, crossing his arms as he glared down at her. Which just made her put her hands on her hips and glower back up at him. \"Oh I don't know. Maybe my baby sister isn't even two months out of a horrible relationship and she's already jumped into a new one. With a guy that's like twice your age and even bigger than the other idiot. What happens when he goes to take a swing at you the way that Marcello did when you broke up with him? Huh? Cause I doubt he'll go down as easily.\" She felt her anger boil as she stepped closer, poking her brother in the chest as she growled at him. \"Sphinx isn't Marcello, Bastian. He isn't going to do the same shit that bastard did . . . and I'm not going to lay around and moan and whine because my last relationship didn't work out the way I wanted it to. He cheated on me. Do I appreciate or like that fact? Hell no. But is it going to rule my life? Again, hell no. Just because you want to wallow in self pity doesn't mean I do.\" He dipped, getting dangerously close to her face as he practically spat at her. \"I am not wallowing, Chaosia. I just have enough sense to not jump into bed with someone on the rebound and have the nerve to call it a relationship. Or to get caught laying all over them when my family is inbound.\" Chaos glared at him, feeling her patience finally pop. She'd had enough of this shit for one lifetime let alone a single damn day. Oh he was going to regret this shit . . . Sphinx heard a loud yelp and a crash from somewhere in the front of the garage and immediately looked for Mirror and Kip. The two had been volleying back and forth all day and he knew it was only a matter of time before they came to blows. But when he spotted them looking just as perplexed as the rest of them- in the same area they'd been in all day- he had to wonder what was going on. Until Mikhail shot past where he and Guadimus were standing; moving to push past Junie and Millennia as they made their way to stand with their respective husbands. Sphinx raised a brow, watching the boy disappear around the corner as he called out to his parents. \"Hey Mom, hey Aunt Junie. I'll go help get the bags in the right cars okay? Just stay right here . . .\" He turned to Eddie, both brows close to meeting his hair line as the older boost just shook his head as his stepson vanished from sight. He was apparently far too used to that to be bothered or even worried about it. Which meant that the kid was a bit more spastic than he'd been acting since they'd come to the garage. \"I got no clue, boy-o. Khail is an odd little runt that's for sure. I never know what's going on with him.\" Sphinx nodded slowly, taking another sip of his beer before he nearly choked as a loud squawk echoed off the walls; followed by an equally loud laugh that was ringing from the direction that Khail had just run towards. Millennia rolled her eyes, shaking her head as she pointedly ignored it. Even with the others starting to come closer to see what was going on. Eddie glanced down to her as she handed him part of her arm load of bags, looking slightly worried about the growing sounds of whatever ruckus was happening on the other side of the garage doors. \"Uh Millie, sweetness? Don't you think we should go check on that?\" She shook her head, flipping her long dark hair over her shoulders as she readjusted her shirt. But even when they heard a high pitched screech she still waved him off. \"Your son has been giving your daughter hell all day apparently. And she swore if he kept it up she was going to smack him. When I passed him he was still just as damn dower as he was when he left so I would put money on that-\" She pointed towards the back of the garage as a loud crash sounded and Khail's voice was heard as he tried to talk over the ruckus- \"is her finally having enough. He'll learn one day not to fuck with her. She got far more of your temper and hard headedness than he did after all . . .\" Eddie winced, shaking his head as he turned to Otto. Who looked about ready to burst at the seams. Sphinx just looked at him like he was crazy. He seriously thought this was funny? \"I thought that the three of them got along okay now? I mean, Khail and Bastian seemed damn near chipper with each other.\" Millennia rolled her eyes, looking to Junie who was giggling as the space finally fell quiet. And a few seconds later Chaosia and Khail emerged, his arm slung over her shoulders as she spoke to him quickly . . . while Bastian walked behind them grumbling and carrying what looked like as many bags as the other two had. But as they got closer even Sphinx was tempted to chuckle at what his girl was saying. She was livid. And her brothers both looked like they'd been tossed face first in the dirt. \"I gave up a free damn day to deal with this bullshit? Seriously? First you idiots crash in uninvited! And start a damn brawl in my kitchen that I have to separate while my retarded boyfriend watched and drank my coffee. Then I get the lecture from Mom before she drags me off into shopping hell! Shopping hell, Mikhail. Where Mom and Junie decided that being all snarky and making little comments about everything I went to buy was the greatest damn entertainment known to womankind! Do you know how damned embarrassing it is to have your mother and aunt sit there and critique everything you buy? Huh?\" She took a deep breath before continuing, oblivious that other people were listening. \"'Oh I bet your boyfriend would like this one!' 'Oh Chaosia don't get that! It looks too much like what you used to wear. You're finally starting to dress better. Don't fall back into old bad habits!' Do you know what its like to hear that for almost four hours, Khail? Four hours! Four hours that was also accompanied by his\" she pointed back to Bastian as he rolled his eyes and huffed, obviously unaffected by her outburst. \"Nonstop text message bitching and whining and complaining about the fact that I'm not a mental midget and actual want to enjoy some of my life. And about how he thinks I'm moving too quickly!\" Khail nodded, running a hand over his sister's arm soothingly as she glared at Bastian. Who just had to speak up and try to defend himself against her. And while Sphinx could understand the boy's weariness where anyone coming to close to his sister was concerned he was about to loose his ability to speak. Because he was nothing like the little ponce that had fucked both of them over before. \"Yeah great. She gripes and complains and then beats the hell out of me. All for trying to tell her that he's wound way tighter than that little pansy she used to fuck ever was. When he snaps its going to be epic. And I'm not going to be the one to identify her corpse.\" Sphinx glowered at the boy, gently tugging his girl away from her brother as she went to lunge at their eldest sibling. Despite how great it would be to see her in action again she wasn't going to pull her damned back open . . . He had far too many plans about how they were going to spend the rest of the evening and that would put a huge damper on them. She growled at her brother before looking to her father, pointing to Bastian as she leaned back into his arms. And he savored the look of shock that passed over the other's faces. Honestly, he'd started seeing the bloody girl . . . that meant he was going to touch her. He grinned mentally. He was going to touch her a lot later . . . and wipe away every single thought and memory of the other idiot and replace them with nothing but him for the rest of the weekend. And as soon as she was in class and gone to her lab on Monday he and Jackson would be paying said idiot a nice little visit. One he was never going to forget. \"Daddy! Get your son before I kill him! I mean it. I've already warned him enough . . .\" Eddie just sighed, rolling his eyes as he moved to keep them separated . . . until Millennia spoke. Causing all four members of her family to stop. Even Chaosia seemed to freeze within his hold as her mother's voice filled the room. And when he glanced around the other boosts had fallen just as still, fearful of inciting the woman's wrath. He snorted to himself. He knew where his girl got her temper from and it wasn't her father. Not by a bloody long shot. \"Enough! Bastian I have no clue how your mother lets you act but you will not behave this way while you're around me. And Chaosia you can handle a little trash talking. You do more than enough of it yourself. Edward, are you going to stand there or are you going to help me get these bags to the car?\" Eddie snapped out of it, shaking his head as he looked at her like she was crazy. But Sphinx had never been so happy as to hear the answer to his question. Oh thank God, miracles did still happen. \"What do you mean? We're leaving?\" She nodded, flipping her dark hair over her shoulders as she turned to hug Junie and Otto good bye. \"Yes dear. We've imposed enough for one day . . . and our darling little girl has much better things to do than entertain us.\" Sphinx glanced down, watching Chaosia's cheeks flush brightly as she rolled her eyes. But she didn't disagree even as she stepped away to hug her mother. Today might just be salvageable yet. But when she spoke up he felt his hopes drop. Damn it he'd forgotten she was going out! \"Yeah. Like go try and watch some Great Whites for a few hours with a bunch of newbies that haven't ever set foot on a boat. A really great time there, Mom. I love you. You guys be careful on your way home . . .\" Millennia smirked, dropping a kiss on her cheek before turning to level a dark look on her sons. Causing Sphinx to smirk to himself as they fidgeted and moved to hug their sister goodbye. But when the woman went to turn to leave she stopped, glancing back to him with a warm smile. A gesture he returned with a small smirk and dip of his head, trying not to grind his teeth at the way the others were about to stroke. Let them gasp and act insane all they wanted. He'd made a valuable ally in Millennia Guadimus and by God he was going to work to keep that . . . especially since it would make his time with her daughter that much easier. The woman in question grinned even brighter before turning to smack Bastian in the back of the head; grumbling to him as she and Junie practically drug him back towards the waiting cars out front. He couldn't hear what she was saying but from the barely contained snickers Mikhail was letting loose as he waved to the Young Bloods it had to be ball busting. Guadimus waited until they were safely outside before he turned to his daughter with pleading eyes and an apologetic smile. \"I swear I had nothing to do with this. You know how she gets when she makes up her mind.\" Chaosia nodded, stepping into her father with a long suffering sigh as she wrapped her arms around his waist. Guadimus hugged her back, shuffling the multitude of bags he was holding to get a better grip on her before he grimaced and tossed the damn things on the ground. He shook his head before looking down to his daughter and Sphinx knew the others weren't ready for what came out of his mouth. Hell he had been exposed to the man before-however limitedly- and he still almost choked. \"That woman gets pissed at me and my credit cards pay the damn price. You'd better appreciate all of the hard work I'm going to have to do to atone for this shite, little girl. Because I've kept my mouth shut for almost two weeks . . . Did you leave anything at the damned malls?\" She laughed, shaking her head before pulling away and handing him the bags. Which he took like they were dipped in poison or something. Sphinx smirked to himself, watching Chaosia stretch to her tiptoes and press a kiss to her father's cheek. \"Sorry Daddy but no. And Mom paid for all of mine and Junie's stuff . . . I love you.\" He sighed, rolling his eyes skyward as he muttered before he nodded. Her father leveled his eyes on him as he nodded before he turned to Otto and Memphis. \"Love you too sweetheart. Behave yourself. And Otto? I'll let you guys know what I find out . . . Shouldn't be too much trouble to ferret out that info.\" Chaosia turned to look at him as Otto nodded, Memphis seeming to relax even more as Sway stepped into his side; looking as perplexed as the rest of them. As soon as her father was out of the garage Chaosia turned, looking to Otto with skeptical eyes. \"What exactly is that old maniac going to ferret out for you?\" Otto shrugged, looking to Memphis before he answered. And Sphinx was torn between being elated that they trusted her enough to tell her about the inner workings of their crew and pissed that they had told her to begin with. She wasn't a runner-not within Long Beach city limits anyway- and he didn't want her to feel obligated to step in should all of this turn into something. A fact he and Memphis were going to discuss at length as soon as she left to go to her deep sea lab. \"Your old man heard about the fight with Johnny B's boys. The crew is apparently running for some new boss that has an outstanding order out. But no one knows what the order is or which boss issued it. So your Pops and Dowers are going to get a feel for what's going on with all of this. If its something we can just brush aside or if it'll need to be dealt with. Until we know for sure there's no real reason to worry Sweetpea. Okay?\" She nodded, leaning back into him heavily before glancing at her watch with a curse. He looked down, raising a brow as she tugged her keys out of her pockets before looking back up to him. \"Shit! I told them they were going to make me late! Can you swing me by the house to pick up my car really quick?\" He nodded, lifting a hand to the others in a half wave as she hugged Otto goodbye. And even though he wasn't too thrilled that she was still going to go out on the sea today he followed her outside, opening the passenger door to the Malibu for her as she hurried to crawl in. He shook his head, going to get in the driver's side with a sigh. She was going to run herself ragged today . . . Chaosia turned to Sphinx as he pulled into her driveway, trying not to gnaw on her bottom lip as she worked through what to say to him. She needed to go inside and change out of this damned skirt then get her ass on the road. If she did that quickly enough she wouldn't be too late to really matter . . . But something about the way he'd watched her since she'd gotten back to the garage made her wonder if she just didn't need to play hookie today. He'd kept track of her over the past week, making sure he knew where she was and what she was doing. But the way he kept looking at her now was even more pronounced. She sighed, shaking herself as he turned the engine off; opening the door to the car. She went to get out only to roll her eyes as he helped her open the door, holding it with one hand as he extended his other to her. She blushed but took it, letting him pull her to her feet. But he didn't let her go as soon as she was steady . . . Actually, he tugged her close; cupping her cheek as he pressed his forehead to hers. And even though the gentle gesture wasn't normal for him-and their relatively short time together- it made her knees weak. But nowhere near as much as his words did. \"Promise me you'll be careful, Love . . .\" She nodded, looking up at him through her lashes as he dipped to press his lips to hers. And even though it was a bare brush of skin it still made her heart jump. What in the hell was going on here? When had all of this . . . intimacy built up between them? She knew they were pretty physical with one another but never anything this tender. She shrugged, taking the unexpected gesture as a sign before she answered him. \"I swear on Io, baby. Do you want to come over when I'm done? We could go out . . . see a movie or go eat.\" He nodded, smirking as he kissed her again. \"It's a date, Lovely. Just call when you're ready . . . Now go on. I know I don't compete with your sharks.\" She felt her grin fall as she wrapped her arms around his neck, slanting her mouth over his as she pulled him as close as she could. She knew it was a forward move-one she usually left to him- but she couldn't stand leaving him with that thought. Even if it had been intended to be a joke. This was all still very new but he was one of the few things that could contend with her love of the sea. He just hadn't realized it yet. She eased away, running her nose against his before she disentangled herself from his arms. But when she went to pull away completely he caught her hand; holding it as she looked up at him. He nodded to her, bringing her knuckles to his lips; ghosting a kiss over them before he spoke to her. \"I'll be waiting Chaosia. Just . . .\" She nodded, hating how cold she felt as her fingers slipped from his. But she had to get ready or she wasn't going to make it in time. And as much as she wanted to stay she had to go and do this. She was far too close to become lackadaisical about her studies now. She just needed to suck it up and go on to class. Besides, he promised he'd be waiting on her . . . and they were going out later tonight. Besides she was going to be on a boat with a small group of other grad students and a professor . . . what was the worst that could happen? I know its kind of a tease but hey I had to get back in the mindset here. Alright. Next chapter is underway and will be up soon. And seriously thanks so much for sticking with this poor neglected and almost abandoned brainchild of mine. Later.[Chapter 23] Okay . . . I'm trying to get back to steady updates here but it isn't easy having to do this between work, class and the hospital so everyone please be patient. And thanks so much for all of the support! A Date Deferred Chaosia laughed as the water splashed up and over the side guard of the small boat her class had taken out for the day. This was far too funny to not have a video camera . . . She turned, grinning at her professor as he shook his head; trying not to laugh out right at the others. They hadn't been able to find any great whites-which until they did this enough to establish their feeding patterns and hunting grounds wasn't too big of a deal- but they had found a small pod of blue whales. And one of the cows had a calf that was absolutely enthralled by the boat. She leaned over the railing, watching the juvenile swim closer to the bow before he shot back to his mother. It was days like this that she loved her major . . . and that she knew she was definitely going to do the right thing with her life. And to think she'd almost called out . . . She shook herself, trying to concentrate on the matter at hand. The sea wasn't too choppy or rough but it wasn't as steady as she'd liked it to be with a load of newbies. And she needed to be alert just incase anything happened. She turned, watching her professor step up beside her as one of the other poor souls shot behind them; hanging halfway over the starboard bow as he puked his guts out. She raised a brow as her instructor shook his head. Seriously? There were hardly any waves or wakes . . . and there was absolutely no wind at all. What was he getting sick over? She glanced up at the teacher, brow raised as the older man just chuckled. She liked this guy enough . . . Brody was mellow and didn't put a lot of emphasis on anything but the research and the sea hours. Meaning that as long as you showed up and did what you were supposed to-and had all of your shit together towards the end of the course- that you would pass with flying colors. Something she could definitely get behind. She turned back to the whales, watching one of the adolescent females jump and fall back into the water before the calf tried his hand at it. He got about half way up before plummeting back into the greenish blue sea gracelessly. She laughed, shaking her head as she looked back to Brody. He had pulled his Raybans off and was cleaning them, shaking his own head as he chuckled. \"Poor kid doesn't have it yet. But give him time and he'll be jumping higher than any of the others.\" She nodded, pushing her hair out of her face as she tugged her hoodie a little tighter. It was getting pretty late in the afternoon, the sun already beginning to make its descent on the western horizon. Meaning that it was starting to get chillier than it had been when they'd lit out closer to five. She sighed, looking up to Brody as he turned to tell the others to get ready to head back in. They were about an hour and a half out now so it would be almost nine before they got back to the docks. Great. A hand on her shoulder brought her attention away from the time and back to the present, bringing her eyes up to meet her instructor's. He grinned, nodding to the helm. \"I'm getting ready to take the helm. I think that we're about the only two who have a clue how to steer this thing . . . . Wanna keep me company?\" Chaos raised a brow but nodded, tugging her jacket tighter as she made her way to the rear of the boat. She watched the other four students huddle around the mast, whispering as they slathered each other with aloe or tried to stay warm. She rolled her eyes, shaking her head. They'd been warned that this wasn't going to be a fun cruise. They needed to dress appropriately and bring the proper materials. Sunscreen, jackets, dry warm clothes, fresh water and sunglasses being among them. She looked up at Brody as he laughed, shaking his head as they gained speed. Now she couldn't hear the others but she could see they were paying close attention to the two of them. Now why in the hell were they doing that? \"Don't pay them any attention Guadimus. You're the only one who didn't almost go overboard today . . . and you knew everything about seafaring before being drilled. Well, that and you knew what type of whales we'd come across.\" She looked back at Brody, watching the wind push his chin length curls this way and that as the boat cut through the waves. She glanced back, watching the two girls glare at her before she rolled her own eyes. She knew why they were being so damned pissy . . . Brody was one of the more sought after teachers at UCSLB. And not just because he was a great teacher. He was in his mid thirties with dark blonde curling hair, big pretty blue eyes and permanently tanned from his time in the sun. And when he wasn't here in Long Beach teaching he was down in the Keys trying to help recover galleons and sunken ships. A freaking modern day Indiana Jones of the water variety . . . She rolled her eyes, leaning back to talk with him as she tried no to snort. They could have him . . . she had her own brooding beau to get home to. \"Uh huh. Sure. Now tell me the one about mermaids and krakens . . . They're pissed this wasn't the party they thought it was going to be and we both know it.\" He shrugged, giving her a lopsided grin as glanced back at the setting sun. The red orb was hanging, barely teetering over the now still and almost mirrored ocean; reflecting most of the light in white crests and prisms while the once blue sky seemed to be on fire. She sighed, watching it for a few moments before she turned back to him as he spoke. She wished Sphinx was here to see this . . . He didn't seem to really care about the ocean one way or another but if he could see it like this-or even watch the sharks and whales when they caught up with them- then maybe she could change his mind. Oh who was she kidding? He was as in love with cars as she was the water . . . and that was something they were just going to have to compromise on. Which wasn't a huge sacrifice seeing as she loved cars almost as much as he did. \"Yeah well, they'll learn to work or they'll drop the class. Usually the way it goes. I start out with about six and end up with about three. I don't know why people hear deep sea lab and think ocean party. Or dating set up.\" She laughed, shaking her head as he cringed. He wasn't as clueless about the reason that a lot of girls took his class as she'd thought. But his next words shocked her enough that she almost toppled when the came across a particularly high crest. Was he serious? She hadn't acted interested at all . . . because she wasn't. Oh she had to set this straight now before this got out of hand. Or her towering boyfriend caught wind of it and removed all of his protruding extremities piece by piece. \"Speaking of which, what are you doing later tonight? I'd be up for grabbing a drink if you wanted to . . .\" She smiled at him, shaking her head the whole time. God please don't ever let Sphinx find out that this guy was hitting on her. Because then things would definitely get ugly. \"I'm going out to a movie and dinner with my boyfriend tonight actually. But thanks for the invitation . . .\" Brody looked at her before laughing, shaking his head as he tried to breathe. \"Kid I wasn't asking you on a date. I was asking you to get a drink so I could see how much you know. But it is nice to know that you're attached to someone and not going to bide your time to jump me.\" She raised a brow, trying not to point out how narcissistic that sounded. But he seemed to catch himself and blushed, trying to smooth that over. \"Well it isn't like it hasn't happened before. Hell a few semesters ago I had a girl sneak on this damn thing in the middle of the night. She was waiting on me the next morning with nothing but a string bikini and a bottle of wine. That came soaring at my head when I told her to get off my damned boat.\" Chaosia laughed, looking at him perplexed. \"Why'd you toss her off? Not hot enough for you?\" He rolled his eyes before giving her a very pointed look. One that she took to mean 'drop it'. She threw her hands up in mock defeat, turning to see the docks coming into view. She smiled, her shoulders sagging. As much fun as all of this had been she just really wanted to go home and get a shower, get dressed and go out with Sphinx. She just hoped they could decide where to go and what to see without too much bloodshed. Sphinx tried not to grind his teeth as he tugged the dark gray dress shirt a bit straighter. He'd forgone his normal suspenders and jeans, pulling a better pair out of the back of his closet and the seldom worn dress shoes he loathed. But the square toed black leather loafers would look good with the dark washed jeans and the dark shirt. Hell he'd even donned a black leather belt. Now he just had to find the black sports jacket he'd stashed in the back of the closet and he would be ready to go. He rolled his eyes, running a hand over his now clean shaven face before he smoothed his hair back. He knew he looked fine but something about actually going out with Chaosia was . . . anxiety inducing. He rarely went on dates. And even though he knew they were together he still felt like he had to make a good impression with this. Now if he just knew where to bloody take her . . . He sighed, shaking his head as he turned and made his way into his living room. Only to glare at the man lounging on his couch. It was days like today that he regretted ever giving Jackson a key . . . He watched the older boost twirl said keys around his finger as he grinned, looking for all the world like the cat that got the canary as he kicked his feet onto his coffee table. \"Still don't know where to take her?\" Sphinx glared, going to grab a beer as he grumbled to himself. He'd known better than to tell Atley anything about this but he just couldn't seem to stop himself. He'd needed help and Jackson had been the least likely to lead him astray. Other than Otto but he wasn't even going to broach that topic. The man was okay with their fledgling relationship but he doubted that would continue if things progressed the way they had been. Especially if they picked up where they'd left off before her parents had gotten here . . . He shook himself, trying to will that memory away. He didn't need to go into tonight with that thought at the forefront. It would only get him in trouble. He moved back into the den, dropping onto the sofa beside Atley as the man grinned and chuckled. Before he pulled two small tickets from his pockets and handed them to him with a Cheshire grin. Sphinx raised a brow, looking over the two passes before he looked back to him like he was crazy. This was insane . . . how in the hell had Atley even known about this? Let alone gotten the damned tickets for it on such short notice? He flipped the smooth paper over in his fingertips, watching Atley settle back into the sofa smugly. \"No thanks necessary. Just take the damn girl and have fun . . . and don't start a damn fight. It was way too difficult to grab those damn things up for you to fuck all of this up by being a jackass. Now I would suggest taking her to dinner first before the two of you go and want the night away.\" Sphinx shook his head, turning to look back at the tickets before he finally just chuckled to himself. Christ what would he do if he didn't have Atley? He'd honestly been contemplating the dinner and a movie idea but now Jackson had given him the key to ensuring they had a wonderful night. But he still couldn't shake the nagging feeling that he'd been planning this . . . He glanced back up, eyes narrowed as he looked his still too smug friend over. \"And how did you come across these then? Because I highly doubt you went and fetched them all on your own . . .\" Atley shrugged, scratching his chin before he looked at him. But Sphinx could see some of the surety fading away into sheepishness. Meaning that Jackson hadn't been the mastermind behind this. He furrowed his brows, trying not to growl as he ground out. \"Jackson. Talk. Now.\" He sighed, running a hand over his slicked back hair before he finally caved. And Sphinx didn't know whether to strangle him or thank him. Actually the lot of them. Did they honestly think he couldn't handle this? Just because he didn't let them know every time he had a bloody lover or girlfriend didn't mean he wasn't some clumsy bollocksing virgin. He knew how to go on dates and where to go . . . he was just a bit hesitant to take Chaosia where he would anyone else. She was . . . different. \"Well Donnie and Sway saw the advertisements for all of this stuff going on down near the aquarium and they figured that the kid would want to go. And the tickets came in twos before you start. And with everything that kind of went on today-her parents popping in, the shit with her brother and then her having to run off to that sea lab- well. They figured the two of you would appreciate the time out and away . . . just the two of you. Because we all know you haven't really seen each other unless it's been at the garage. Not with her school and your work.\" Sphinx glared before rolling his eyes. He would just take this as the good will gesture it'd been meant as this time. But he wouldn't be so forgiving next time. This is why he hadn't wanted anyone to fucking know about them. They all wanted to get in the bloody middle and meddle. \"Thanks for this Jackson but the lot of you need to stay out of my affairs. Or do you fancy another trip to the dirt? For trying to meddle and scheme?\" Atley rolled his eyes before nodding, pushing up off the couch and going towards the door as he grumbled. \"Hey we were just trying to help you big idiot. Don't snap our heads off. Besides how else are you going to make this work huh? The first month she was here you didn't even know she was sweet on your stupid ass until we pushed you together. Just accept the help and get over it. Or don't and fuck it up. But either way we're just trying to be good friends.\" He stepped out the door, slamming it behind him as Sphinx sighed; running hand down his face as he grumbled. Great. Now he'd pissed Jackson off. Again. God he was worse than a bloody woman. Chaosia opened the front door of her house, looking over Sphinx as he raised a brow. She'd called him when she'd gotten in before she'd gone for the shower. But the mix of the sun and all of the drama at the mall the shop and on the damned boat had made her a lot draggier than she'd thought. Oh who was she kidding? She'd gone to sleep in the damned shower and would still be there if the water hadn't run cold. She sighed, tugging her robe tighter around her as she tried not to blush. Her boyfriend looked really freaking good tonight . . . especially in that damned shirt. She shook herself, going to go back upstairs to get dressed when he caught her. He turned her, pushing his fingers into her wet curls as he looked her over; shaking his head. \"You burned, Chaos.\" She reached up, touching her warm cheeks before shrugging. She would be tan again tomorrow but it was still weird that she'd gotten red today. But then again the sun reflecting off the waves was bound to make her cook one way or another. His thumb traced her cheek as his hand slid to cup her face, making her blush as she leaned into the kiss he dropped on her lips. God he couldn't start doing stuff like that. So her mother hadn't-openly- freaked as badly as they'd both been expecting . . . it still didn't mean they were out of the deep end yet. And if he started with all of this sweet shit then she was going to be in over her head far faster than she wanted to be. But his next words made her think that maybe that wasn't such a bad thing. \"We have passes to the Midnight Mash down at the Aquarium . . . but they're doing this all weekend. We could go tomorrow and just stay in tonight. You look about ready to drop.\" She tried to gather her outrage and anger but failed, sinking into him as he tugged her closer. She looked up at him, almost pleadingly as he smirked to her; brushing her drying tangled ringlets out of her face. \"You wouldn't mind? I know those passes weren't cheap . . . and you're dressed to go out. Would you really just stay here with me?\" His smirk fell as his face softened, his lips brushing her cheek as he spoke and pressed his forehead to hers. \"There's nowhere else I'd rather be, Lovely. Lets just make sure we actually make it to a bed this time.\" She grinned leaning into him as she kissed his cheek. \"Okay . . . who are you and what have you done to Sphinx? Because this is far too perfect for me to believe its happening.\" He chuckled, shaking his head before he kissed her again. And as soon as his lips hit hers this time she felt a good bit of the passion from before return. She wrapped her arms around his neck, tugging him closer as his hands traveled down to settle on terry cloth draped hips. She gasped as he pulled her hips into his, which let his tongue slip past her lips to mingle with her own. After a few intense moments they parted, one of his hands coming back up to cup her cheek as the other kept her steady against him. She smirked, kissing his chin lightly. She wasn't going anywhere any time soon . . . he didn't need to worry about that. His eyes searched hers for a few seconds before he nodded towards the way she'd come. And she knew what he was silently asking her. She nodded, reaching out to lock the door before his fingers looped through hers. He brought her hand to his lips, brushing them against her knuckles the way he had before she left. But something in this gesture was different than before. He wasn't telling her to be careful or trying to be sweet. He was just touching her to touch her. Because he wanted to . . . and he wanted her to know it. She smiled to him, squeezing his fingers as went to go back towards the stairs in her den. Staying in with him sounded like a much better plan. Even if she couldn't believe she was giving up the chance to go around the aquarium without the crowds . . . She grinned before laughing as he scooped her up when she yawned, shaking his head as he chided her for trying to do too much at once. She pressed a kiss to his jaw, snuggling into his hold. She didn't care what Bastian said or how the little doubts his outburst had caused to flare to life had been eating at her . . . Sphinx wasn't Marcello. And she was definitely happier with him than she'd been in years. Now she just had to make sure that she didn't do anything to screw it up . . . A short but sweet update . . . and I totally see Brody looking a lot like Mathew McCaugnehey (sp?). ","Summary":" Okay boys and girls . . . Here's the deal.

He has his friends and familynclose by him, and lives a much quieter, happier life.nThings change.[Chapter 2] Chapter 1. Memphis hummed along to his radio as he worked under the hood of an oldnFord Pickup. The familiar roar of a motorbike made him look up from hisnwork and smile. He walked out onto the garage driveway, wiping his hands onna rag as he went. The black bike pulled up in front of him. \"Hi.\" He said as Sway climbed off her beloved Yamaha. She was sporting hernusual black leather Capri pants and long charcoal-grey duster. \"Hey.\" She smiled and walked towards him as she shook her long, blondendreadlocks free from her helmet. \"Busy day?\" \"Nah, not bad.\" He greeted her with a kiss and they walked together backninto the garage. Sway placed her helmet on the roof of the pickup andnleaned back against the side of it, her arms crossed over her chest. \"Hey Otto. How's it goin'?\" \"Fine thanks love.\" Otto was about the only person Memphis had ever knownnto survive calling Sway 'love'. He'd tried it himself once, and had earnednhimself a look that had ensured he never had again. Otto rested his pen on the stack of papers in front of him and took off hisnglasses \"You got much done on the old Tourer?\" Sway had ditched her job at a garage to help an old friend from high schoolnbuild up a touring car. They had acquired the engine and shell for a SubarunImpretza, after a very successful night at the card table, and itsnrestoration was an ongoing process. \"Not bad, Rachel's gonna see if she can find us a new front axel tomorrow.\" \"By find, I hope you mean buy, not 'borrow'.\" Memphis cut in. Sway shot him a mischievous little grin that Otto had to laugh at. AlthoughnSway was basically clean now, she had never been able to completely ridnherself of her wild criminal streak. She pushed herself away from the truck and circled it her eyebrows raised. \"I have to say Mr. Raines, this is a mighty fine heap of junk you gotnyourself here!\" Memphis laughed, \"I know. Don't know why they don't justndrop the old girl off at the junkyard. Third time she's been in thisnmonth.\" He patted the hood affectionately. Sway bent down behind the truck and stared thoughtfully at it. \"Well I know a certain touring car that could use a nice fat tailpipe likenthis if anyone does decide to put her to rest.\" \"Don't even go there Sway.\" Warned Otto \"We are not dismantling any more ofnour clients cars for you, there was enough trouble last time you 'borrowed'nparts.\" Sway giggled and straightened up. \"Hey Junie.\" She waved as Otto's wife entered the garage from the backroom. \"Hello Sway honey. You two kids staying for dinner?\" \"Thanks Junie but I think we'll be getting home. A frozen pizza calls!\"nSaid Memphis grinning. \"Honestly Sway.\" Junie folded her arms \"You should learn to cook, you can'tnkeep feeding your poor man frozen meals.\" \"I aint feeding him shit.\" Said Sway one eyebrow quirked \"He can feednhimself. The day he asks me where his dinner is, is the day he looses hisnmanhood. Aint that right Mr. Raines?\" Memphis laughed and held his hands up in front of his body. \"I wouldn'tneven dare.\" Junie shook her head and smiled at the wayward young woman. Since the bignboost, Memphis and Sway had become a regular fixture in her's and Otto'snlives, what with Memphis buying into the business. She felt a strangencompulsion to protect the two of them, even though they were more than oldnenough to (an capable of) looking after themselves, she still enjoyed tonplay something of a mom too them. \"Well if you're sure. Its pot roast.\" She tried to tempt the young couplenone last time. \"No thanks Junie. We'll be fine.\" Sway picked her bike helmet up off thenFords roof and began to walk toward the garage door. \"See ya tomorrow.\" At that moment an earth shattering bang echoed through the small space.nTools fell from the walls and metal-shelving units crashed to the floor. \"Sway!\" Shouted Memphis as he rugby tackled her to the floor, a large wheelnjack smashing down in the spot she had just been standing. Junie screamed out and Otto instinctively ducked down under his desk. Theynall lay stunned for a second and as the dust settled, the state of thengarage came into view. The concrete floor was barely visible beneath carnparts and tools, the small wooden door at the garage entrance was hangingnon one hinge and the shock wave had caused the old ford pickup to collapsenonto its wheel arches. \"You Ok?\" breathed Memphis into Sways ear. She was face down on the floornwith Memphis lying on top of her. She ignored his question and rolled himnoff her. \"What the fuck was that!!?\" She scrambled up and stalked towards the nownbattered door. Memphis climbed to his feet and looked across at Otto whonjust stared blankly back at him. Junie was crouched in a corner shocknpredominant on her face. From outside the garage they heard Sway scream. \"Noooooooo! Josephine. Oh god! NO!\" Memphis ran to the door and cursed under his breath at what he saw on thendriveway. Sway was knelt on the floor, her head in her hands, the wreckage of hernbeloved bike strewn around her in a hundred pieces. She straightened up andnthrew her head back, her eyes closed. \"Memphis,\" She said through gritted teeth \"Who. The fuck. DID THIS!!!\" withnthe last two words, she jumped to her feet and kicked a large piece ofnsmoking bike chassis across the drive. \"Hey, hey.\" Memphis ran forwards and grabbed her shoulders \"Calm down.nSway,\" She twisted around and he tried to gain eye contact with her \"Sway,\"nShe stopped struggling and looked directly at him \"Calm down.\" She took a shaky breath and blinked hard. Memphis noticed a glassy sheen innher eyes and gathered her up in his arms. She rested her head on hisnshoulder and sighed. \"Shhh.\" He rocked her slightly and kissed the top of her head \"calm down.\" Just then his mobile rang and he stepped away pulling it from his jacketnpocket. Sway turned around, her back to him, and scanned the debris innfront of her, hands on her hips, her jaw clenched tight. \"Hello.\" Memphis answered the call. \"Raines!\" Said a voice on the end of the line \"How ya doin' boy?\" \"Johnny B?\" He asked. Sway spun around and stared at Memphis her eyesnnarrowed, her breathing steadily increasing. \"Yea! Well done Raines.\" Memphis looked Sway in the eyes. She shook hernhead in disbelief, the anger on her face rising and then she lunged atnMemphis. \"Give me the goddamn phone.\" He held her off \"MEMPHIS! GIVE ME THE GODDAMNnPHONE!\" \"Sway.\" He grabbed her arm and shook his head. He heard Johnny chuckle innhis ear. \"YOU BASTARD!\" screamed Sway \"I'M GONNA KILL YOU!\" she wrenched herselfnfrom Memphis's grip and kicked the wall behind her in rage. \"You still not managed to tame that pretty little thing yet boy?\" \"What do you want Johnny?\" \"What's this! Like I can't jus' ring up for a chat with an old buddy. Annold bud who got me sent to jail for the past two years.\" Memphis chuckled slightly. \"Don't you dare laugh boy!\" Shouted Johnny \"Two years. Two damn years I gotnfor the little stunt you pulled in the café parkin' lot. They didn't jus'nget me for illegal arms you know!\" \"Oh really?\" Said Memphis noncommittally \"Yeah really. You boy, you got me nailed for a whole bunch of boosts andnother shit! Cops, they hold grudges. They catch you doin' one thing wrong,nthey get you for everything else you ever done.\" \"Goddamn cops eh?\" \"Yeah. But as far as I figure, I got some scores to settle with you toonboy.\" Memphis suddenly felt his stomach sink \"What kind of scores?\" He saidnquietly. \"Can you imagine what you might be scraping up of that there driveway ifnyour pretty little woman had been two minutes later getting here?\" His legs suddenly felt weak and he whipped round to look at Sway who stoodnopposite him, her brow furrowed. He didn't take his eyes off hers as henreplied to Johnny through gritted teeth. \"You even so much as touch her I swear to god I will kill you, and feed younto my dog, you here me?.\" Sways sucked in a sharp breath and began tonbreathe heavily. Johnny laughed \"Rough talk for such a little boy. You know?\" He paused \"Younshould tell her she shouldn't wear black so often, makes her look rough,nyou know what I'm sayin'?\" Memphis whipped around and scanned the area around the garage. \"That's right. I can see you boy. And your pretty woman. Damn she sexy whennshe's all heated up.\" \"Sway get inside!\" Barked Memphis. \"What?\" She looked around uneasily. \"Please.\" She stayed for a few more seconds, searching Memphis's dark greenneyes. After noticing the pleading and fear within them, she turnednbegrudgingly on her heel and walked back into the relative safety of thengarage. Memphis drew a long breath as he watched her retreating back, and thennfocussed his attention back to the phone call. \"What do you want?\" He asked calmly. \"Now you're talking boy!\" *** End chapter 1 ***[Chapter 3] Chapter 2. Memphis waited on the line with baited breath for the ultimatum to be laidnout before him. \"You cost me two years of my life Raines, an' therefore should pay for it.nWe got a score to settle. Don't you think that's fair?\" \"Well as far as I can see, it was you that broke the law and therefore youncost yourself.\" \"Shut the hell up Raines!!! You really don't wanna be messin' with me rightnnow! You think that bike is the only thing I can blow up? Next time I mightnget your girl!!\" \"Okay, Okay.\" Said Memphis quickly \"I'm listening.\" As much as he hated tongive Johnny the satisfaction of controlling him, he wasn't about tonjeopardize Sway's life for the sake of his pride. \"What do you want me tondo?\" \"I want you out of my life Raines. I don't ever want to set eyes on younagain. You see, I considered just smokin' your little woman outright, butndecided to give her a chance. That way, if I didn't get her, you'd know Inwas serious. I want you out of Long beach Raines. You and your little possenyou got goin' there. And I want that garage and your flat. It's hard tonfind work when you just got out. The boosters think you're a liability, andnfor some reason my local super store don't wanna know me.\" He pausednwaiting for a response from Memphis \"You still listening to me Raines?\" \"Yeah. Yeah I'm listening.\" Memphis looked back at Otto's garage. Henthought about the life he'd just built up here. About Otto and Junie. Aboutnhis Mum and her happiness that he was home (and honest). He thought aboutnKip and their ongoing battle to help him leave boosting behind. He thoughtnabout Sway and how every morning he woke up next to her in their home, andnshe told him how happy she was. Could he really just collect their lives upnand put them in a removals van as easily as he could their furniture? ThennSway flashed into his mind again. He couldn't risk her, but at the samentime he couldn't shatter her world and move it somewhere else all becausenof some stunt he'd pulled two years ago. Then he had an idea. \"So if I don't leave long beach, you're going to kill my girlfriend. Isnthat what you're saying?\" \"Yeh Raines. Do you want me to spell it out in the sky?\" \"No I get it. Its just.\" He paused \"Just what? What's so hard to understand about that? You leave, the girlnlives.\" \"Well don't you think, for a notorious Boost such as yourself, that thatnseems a little, you know, weak?\" \"What!!!!! Raines, you got a hearing problem or something.\" \"No, no, no.\" Memphis shook his head \"Its just, wouldn't you prefer tondrive me out of long beach in a way that's gonna earn you respect and getnyou back onto the guest list of those Boosters you said won't employ younanymore?\" Johnny was quiet for a second. Memphis knew he had hit the spot. \"Go on, I'm listening.\" \"Well, how bout you give me till, lets say midnight tonight, that's fournand a half hours, to think up a bet that gives me a chance of staying.\" \"And why would I want to do that? And don't give me all that street-crednshit, cause I aint buying it. Why would I want to give you a chance when Incould just as easily get rid of you, no fuss?\" \"Because this way, you could win something too. The winner stays in longnbeach and gets,\" Memphis quickly thought up a suitable figure \"$10,000 fromnthe loser, and the respect of winning. What do you think?\" \"$10,000 aint much Raines.\" \"Yeah, but you just came out of jail so you can't have made that much moneynin the last two years. Besides this aint about money is it, really. Likenyou said, we've got a score to settle. Lets settle it.\" \"Call me at midnight and we'll see what you come up with.\" Johnny hung upnand Memphis shut off his phone. He couldn't help realising that in the space of a two-minute call, his lifenhad been turned back upside down. That scared him. He sighed and turnednaround back towards the garage. Sway was stood leaning on the doorframe;nthe look on her face told him that she had only caught the second half ofnhis conversation. \"You fucking hypocrite.\" She hissed shaking her head \"All you've beennteaching Kip about staying clean, and as soon as your old playmate comesnback, you're all out for settling damn scores!\" \"Sway,\" He tried to reason \"Its not what you think.\" \"The hell its not! You know how hard I have to work to stay clean?\" \"I know Sway. I….\" \"I don't wanna hear it. You aint dragging me back into this shit Memphis.nI've been jerked around by you one too many times.\" \"Sway.\" Memphis took as step towards her, but she walked back into thengarage. Before he could reach the door, she had returned with a set of keysnin her hands. \"Sway please.\" She stormed past him and Memphis realised that the keysnbelonged to Eleanor. \"Sway, what are you doing.\" He asked warily. She spun around and stared at him viciously \"What, so you can revert backnto the life, like that,\" She clicked her fingers \"But I can't?! I'm goingnfor a joyride.\" And with that, she unlocked the Mustang, jumped behind the drivers seat andntore out of the driveway. Memphis flinched as she threw the car into a bendnand disappeared leaving a cloud of dust in her wake. He wasn't flinchingnfor the car though; foremost in his mind was the worry of Sway driving whennshe was angry. He had discovered the problems that this posed earlier innthe year, when she had driven off on her bike after a they had had a fightnand crashed it into the back of another driver. She had been lucky tonescape with minor injuries, a broken collarbone and numerous bruises, butnthat was all it was, luck. He didn't want to find out if her luck wouldnhold out a second time, and ran into the garage to get a set of cars keys. *** Sway floored the Mustang along the freeway. She was furious, a fire burnedninside her chest and she found it hard to slow her breathing. She didn'tnhave a short fuse, but when it blew, it blew! The engine roared and thensound of the sexy car soothed her slightly. Then she thought of Memphis,nand the promises he had made her, and she thought of Johnny B and her bike. Josephine. The image of her beautiful sleek black Yamaha lodged in hernmind. She clenched her jaw so tightly it made her teeth hurt and her eyesnnarrowed. \"BASTARD!!\" She screamed pounding her fists on the steering wheel. Thenclock read 110mph. She stroked the nitrous boost in the shifter and a slynsmile crept across her lips. \"Come on then Eleanor baby,\" She swung the GT500 around a Porsche doing anpitiful 80mph in front of her and stopped level with it in the next lane.nThe businessman in the drivers seat glanced across at her and winked. \"Burnnbaby burn.\" She said to herself and blew a sultry kiss to the suit as shenslammed her finger down on the red button. *** Memphis ran into the garage. \"Otto I need a car.\" Otto looked up at him. He was kneeling on the floornpicking up some of the fallen tools. \"What's been going on out there Memphis?\" Asked Otto standing up \"Sway saidnyou sent her inside. Why? What's happening? What's gotten her so mad?\" \"Johnny B rang.\" Said Memphis rummaging in the desk draw for Otto's carnkeys. \"He wants us to leave Long Beach. That explosion was Sways bike.\" \"I'd gathered that.\" Memphis straightened up looking around the wreckage of a garage. Where werenthe damned keys? \"Well have you thought what would have happened if Sway had left Rachel'sntwo minutes later?\" \"Oh shit.\" Said Otto squeezing his eyes shut and massaging his temples withnhis thumb and forefinger. \"Exactly. Oh shit. If we don't leave he says he'll kill her. And I believenhim.\" He shuffled through the key rack. The ford, a Shelby AC cobra up onnjacks, and set of the door keys. \"Otto where the hell are your keys?\" Otto ignored his question \"So you're going to leave?\" \"No I persuaded him to take a bet with me. I have to get back to him atnmidnight with a suitable one.\" \"And this is the only bit of the conversation Sway caught right?\" \"Bingo.\" Said Memphis \"And now she's fuming and has gone off in Eleanor.\" \"Oh god. This just gets better\" Otto shook his head \"Angry Sway and speedndon't go. You remember what happened last time?\" \"Its all I can think about\" Memphis shuffled papers around on the workbenchnhoping to locate the keys there. \"You got any nitrous in her?\" Memphis looked up at Otto. \"Exactly why I need your car.\" ***End chapter 2***[Chapter 4] Chapter 3. \"My car's not here.\" Said Otto \"I loaned it to Kip this morning. He wasngetting itchy.\" Memphis's brother had been having a very hard time gettingnaway from the life the others had successfully left behind. He was hooked,nand like addicts, her got cravings. Otto owned a sleek, flame red, 1963nCorvette Stingray coupe. Kips favourite relief tonic. \"Shit!\" Cursed Memphis. \"I need to find her Otto.\" He looked across at thenCobra. It would take too long to get that down off the jacks. On thenopposite side of the garage, the pickup caught in his vision out of thencorner of his eye. He pulled they keys off the rack behind him and jumpedninto the battered old vehicle. \"I think you'll need a push\" Said Otto positioning himself behind the carn\"Okay, on three. One, two, three!\" Otto heaved against the Ford and itnbegan to roll slowly forwards. Memphis turned the key in the ignition andnit rumbled to life coughing and emitting a slightly worrying cloud of blacknsmoke from under the hood. \"Find her Memphis, before she goes and does something stupid.\" \"I will.\" He said as he pulled out of the garage and jerked around thencorner disappearing from view. Otto sighed as he watched him go \"I hope you do.\" He said quietly tonhimself before returning his attention back to his wrecked garage. *** \"YES!!!\" Shouted Sway as the Nitrous kicked in and the car lurchednforwards. The engine roared and the needle on the clock hovered on 150mph.nShe glanced up in her mirror at the fading Porsche and laughed at thenbewildered look on the face of the businessman inside it. She began to instantly feel better as she weaved the speeding car in andnout of the traffic before her. The accelerator beneath her foot gave her ansense of extreme power. She closed her eyes for a second and savoured thenfeeling whilst it lasted. The clock began to slowly drop back down towardsna more normal reading as the nitrous ran out. Sway eased her foot off thenaccelerator, but at 120mph, by the time she noticed what was ahead of her,nit was already too late. *** Memphis shivered as the cold night air blasted through the windows of thenPickup. It was 10:30pm and after driving around for three and a half hours,nhe had had no success in finding Sway, and was on his way back to theirnapartment building. The fact that he had not discovered a wreckage of anmangled Ford Mustang was a relief, however he was still worried how farnSway might have ventured. The truck lurched forwards as he shifted downninto 1st and pulled into the car lot. He stopped in a space about eight cars down from the buildings entrance andnturned off the engine. The struggling Ford shuddered to a standstill, andnout of the corner of his eye, Memphis noticed something that made is heartnrise in his chest. In a parking space, shining under a streetlamp, sat a now rather well usednlooking Eleanor. He gripped the top of the pickup's steering wheel andndropped his head onto his hands sighing a huge sigh of relief. \"Don't worry your beloved Eleanor's back in one piece.\" The voice made himnjump and Memphis whipped his head to the left to see Sway stood at hisnwindow, her hands on her hips. \"Jesus Sway!\" He said, \"It wasn't the Goddamned car I was worried about.\"nHe reached out to touch her arm, but she turned and walked away. Henwrestled with the door, creaked it open and jumped out of the truck,nfollowing her up to the tall building. \"Here you go.\" She said throwing the keys to Eleanor over her shouldernwithout even looking back at him. \"Where the hell have you been Sway?\" She ignored her question and took thenstairs up to their apartment two at a time. She suddenly stopped and spunnaround. \"You might need some more Nitrous cylinders.\" \"Jesus Sway! You could have….\" \"Don't worry! I didn't crash! Didn't break your Eleanor. Got me a nicenspeeding ticket though.\" She turned back around and continued up the stairsnto their floor. \"Where the hell did you use it!?\" \"Freeway.\" She replied matter-of-factly. \"Jesus Sway!\" \"You said that. Twice.\" \"I know. Didn't you think that I wouldn't be worried about you…\" \"I think I can just about manage to drive a car Memphis.\" She threw an'look' at him over her shoulder as she unlocked the door to apartmentnnumber 76. \"You don't remember what happened last time then?\" She didn't reply and instead walked into the living room of their home andnswitched on the lights. Memphis closed the door and leaned back against it,nhis head tipped back, eyes closed. He heard Sway throw her jacket on anchair and flop down on the sofa. She clicked on the TV and the sounds fromnan old Western movie blared out into the small room. Memphis straightened up \"Sway I need to talk to you.\" \"Talk, sure, talk. Hey haven't I said that to you before. Like last timenyou deserted me and came back expecting-\" \"Sway I'm not deserting you.\" \"As good as. You're trying to drag me back into this life, the life I'ventried so damned hard to leave behind -\" \"Sway-\" She jumped to her feet and turned the western off \"No, shut the hell up! You know why I'm so pissed? Its 'cause you're thenreason I stay clean. I stupidly thought,\" She began to pace the roomnfuriously \"that I couldn't let you down! That the only reason I even bothernto try staying away from the life is because I don't want you to be draggednback with me! Well fool me, 'cause it looks like you couldn't really give anshit could you!\" Memphis shook his head \"Sway, listen to me…\" \"No! Why the fuck should I! You go and play with your little friend. See ifnI care!\" She marched off towards the bedroom, her end of the argumentnclosed. \"He's going to kill you!\" Shouted Memphis. He had been trying to let thisnin gently, but Sway wasn't listening and it was the only way he could thinknto get her attention. He screwed his eyes shut as she stopped dead in herntracks. \"What.\" She said softly, never turning around. \"Johnny B. If we don't get out of long beach, he's gonna kill you.\" She turned around to face him, her eyes searching his. \"So what's all thisnabout a bet?\" \"I convinced him to make it into a bet so we've at least got a chance ofnstaying. I have to think one up by midnight or else we're out of here. \" Sway sunk down into a recliner and put her head in her hands. \"Oh god.\" She said quietly, barely above a whisper, \"I can't believe thisnis happening again.\" Memphis walked across the room and sat on the arm of the chair. He put hisnarm around her shoulder and kissed the top of her head. \"We'll sort this. I promise. I won't let him hurt you.\" She sat up and looked at him \"Jesus Memphis, I don't need protecting!\" Shengrinned to show that she was joking and Memphis laughed. \"Tell you what, if we do win this, you can have some 'fun' with Johnny innthe name of Josephine!\" He leant forwards as he spoke his lips barelynmillimetres from Sway's. \"Now you're talking!\" She smiled, and kissed him. ***End chapter 3***[Chapter 5] Chapter 4. Otto was knelt on the floor of the garage salvaging some of his lessndamaged tools when Junie shouted in to him from outside. \"Otto, Memphis is here and it looks like Sway's with him!\" His heart rose in his chest and the heavy weight that had been resting innhis gut for the past couple of hours disappeared as he clambered to hisnfeet \"Thank God.\" He said to himself as he made his way outside to standnwith his wife. They watched as Eleanor pulled up the drive and Memphis and Sway climbednout. \"You nearly gave us a heart attack girl, don't you ever pull that onenagain.\" Otto walked to meet the pair and playfully punched Sway on thenshoulder. She grinned but it never quite reached her eyes. She stood nextnto Junie who placed an arm around the young woman's waist and watched hernsurveying the ground where the broken remains of her dream had previouslynbeen lying. \"We cleared the pieces away.\" Said Junie softly. Sway looked up at her and nodded, her blue eyes tarnished with pain. Junienhad never really understood the connections that these people had withntheir cars (or in this case Bikes), but she knew that that bike had meantneverything to the young woman standing beside her, and losing it was as ifnshe had lost a child. The four walked back into the garage together and Sway let out a longnwhistle as she noticed the carnage around her. \"Whoa, Jesus Otto, that is one hell of a mess!\" \"Yep,\" Otto replied sighing \"Tell me about it.\" \"We need to come up with a bet.\" Interjected Memphis suddenly \"I know thisnis something that we would rather ignore, but it isn't going to happen. Wenhave to face up to this, this is happening and there is nothing we can donabout it.\" He looked over a Sway who glanced away, \"We can't just leave ournhomes and our lives behind for scum like Johnny, we have to fight fornthis.\" \"We know,\" Said Otto softly, placing a hand on Memphis's shoulder \"but wencant do this alone. How much time do we have?\" Memphis looked down at his watch \"45 minutes.\" \"Lets get going on this then.\" Said Otto forcefully. Sway and Memphisnpulled mobile phones out of their pockets and Otto picked up the garagenlandline.n\"Time to re-unite the gang.\" Mumbled Junie quietly to herself as she walkednout to make some coffee, leaving behind her the sounds of urgentnconversation into three separate phones. *** As Memphis scanned the room he got a sense of ironic dejavu at the sightnbefore him. Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man and Freb sat lounging on one of Otto'sndesks and the area surrounding it, unable to hide the curiosity andnexcitement from their faces. Sphinx lent against a wall in the shadows annenigma as ever. Otto stood besides him deep in his own thoughts and Swaynsat in a chair, arms crossed across her chest looking at Memphis tensely. \"Is everyone here,\" asked Memphis \"Where's Toby?\" \"Er, I told him not to come unless we need him,\" answered Kip running anhand through his mussed hair \"after what happened last time I thought-\" Memphis nodded and Kip trailed off. \"Right guys I guess you all know what going on here, Johnny B's back inntown and he aint happy,\" Memphis looked around at them all \"he wants us allnout of long beach.\" \"And if we don't go?\" Asked Tumbler. Memphis glanced across at Sway who quickly lowered her gaze \"You don't wantnto know.\" He said keeping his eyes on her. \"So, like, what's all this about a bet then?\" Kip raked a hand through hisnhair again as he spoke. \"Well, Johnny aint too bright,\" everyone smirked as Memphis said this \"andnI managed to convince him that this was about pride as well as revenge. Ifnwe can come up with a decent bet in,\" He looked at his watch \"10 minutes,nhe will take it and we got a chance to stay and earn some cash in thenprocess.\" He took a deep breath \"I understand that this is hard for younall, but we need to do this and I need your help.\" They all nodded, and agreements of \"Sure\" were muttered. \"Good, then we need to get thinking, we need to find something that he-\" Hencut off as Sway pushed back her chair and walked from the garage. \"Sway,\" He called after her \"Keep thinking.\" He said to the rest of them asnhe followed his girlfriend out of the door. *** Sway stood against the garage wall, head back, eyes closed. \"Sway.\" Memphis prompted softly. She took a deep breath and opened her eyes \"I can't do this.\" She saidnstaring straight ahead. \"You don't have to boost if you don't want to. We need plenty of peoplenbehind the scenes as well.\" She turned to look at him shaking her head \"No Memphis, I can't do this.\"nShe gestured around herself \"Look at you, you're doing things that younvowed never to do again-\" \"I don't have a choice Sway you know that.\" \"Exactly Memphis. You don't have a choice. Because of me, I'm the reasonnthat all this is happening-\" \"Your not the reason, you just happen to be the unlucky one that Johnnynpicked on.\" \"Yeah.\" Sway looked down at her feet and drew a deep breath \"I think Inshould leave Memphis.\" \"What!\" Memphis walked around in front of her and grabbed her arms urgentlyn\"You're going nowhere Sway, I need you right now.\" She looked him in the eyes \"Memphis, if I leave, Johnny holds nothingnagainst you. You can end this stupid bet-\" \"Until he picks the next of you for ransom. Kip, Junie, Mom, you, you'renall the same to him Sway, a way to get at me.\" He sighed and kissed hernforehead gently \"If anyone should leave Sway, it should be me, but Incan't.\" He removed his hand from her arms and rested them against the wallnbehind her, leaning in to her body. She looked away for a second unsure and confused as to what she should do,nand then when her eyes met his she knew that there was no way she couldnleave this man. She had fallen in love with him all over again and would donanything she could to help him through this. She nodded and kissed himnsoftly on the lips. \"I know Memphis, I'm sorry.\" \"I won't let him hurt you Sway,\" Memphis spoke severely \"We are going to donthis and we are going to do this together.\" He pushed back of the wall andnheld a fist out in front of her at waist level \"You with me?\" Sway smiled at his outstretched fist. A gesture to start a handshake theynhad had along time ago, when they had boosted cars together, as a living.nShe brought her own fist down on top of his and then did the same to thenunderside. \"I'm with you.\" She grinned and grabbed his jacket lapels pulling him in tonher and covering his mouth with her own. They stood together locked in a long embrace, before being interrupted bynsomeone clearing their throat to their left. They quickly pulled apart andnKip grinned at them. \"We're waiting for you guys in there.\" \"Okay,\" Said Sway pulling her jacket back onto her shoulders \"We're comingnnow Kip.\" Memphis looked at her inquisitively \"Are you sure?\" She nodded once and took his hand in hers, walking with him and Kip backninto the garage, a plan already formulating in her mind. *** end chapter 4 ***[Chapter 6] Chapter 5. \"Any ideas?\" Asked Memphis as he returned to the front of the group. Swaynsat down on the edge of a desk next to Kip who flung a casual arm aroundnher shoulders. \"Like, what is there, that we can do, but he can't?\" He asked shrugging \"Steal cars.\" Snorted Tumbler. Kip laughed but Memphis stayed quiet. \"We make it something he can relate to.\" Interjected Sway suddenly. Memphisnlooked at her, \"You have an idea?\" She nodded \"Yeah,\" She stood up and began to pace back and forth \"The only language henseems to understand is that of the big green dollar right?\" They all noddedn\"So, this doesn't just need to be about status and pride, we need to makenit one for the money.\" \"Yeah, but we 'aint got no money to give him!\" Said Kip. Sway waved andismissive hand at him, \"Not literally, that's the thing,\" She looked at Memphis now talking solelynto him \"We've done the whole, how many cars can you steal thing, but how bout thisntime we don't make it about numbers. How bout this time we see how much carnwe can boost.\" \"Eh?\" Kip and the others frowned at her obviously puzzled, but a smallnsmile crept across Memphis's face. She never let him down. \"What Sway is trying to say Kip, is that she is a genius and has just comenup with a bet he will never refuse!\" He kissed her lightly on the foreheadnand she laughed softly. \"Guys,\" Otto pointed at his watch \"Hate to interrupt, but its 12 o clock.\" Memphis nodded and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. \"Lets just hope this works,\" He muttered to himself as it began to ring innhis hand. *** Sway stood alone outside whilst her friends gathered around Memphis in thengarage, hanging on every word he muttered down the phone. She closed herneyes and felt the sting of despairing tears behind her eyelids. She drew anlong and distinctly shaky breath and opened them, unable to shake thenschoolgirl wish that when she did it would all be gone. She raised thencigarette to her lips and savored the soothing nicotine. It had been nearlynfour years since she had last felt she needed one, it made her realized hownshot her nerves must be. Even the situation two years ago hadn't caused anrevolt back into the world of Kools. She stared at Eleanor sitting on the driveway. Gleaming silver through thenheavy dark of the midnight sky. She imagined herself climbing behind thenwheel and driving away, away from it all. Blasting off into the night andnforgetting everything. But she couldn't do that, it wasn't her style, itnwasn't Sway.nSo, she flicked the butt of her cigarette to the ground, turned on her heelnand walked back. Head held high, face uncaring, eyes hard, Sway all over. *** Memphis briefly noticed Sway walk across the garage and settle in thenshadows, before turning his attention back to the matter at hand. The long silence down the phone was now beginning to make him feelnphysically sick, this had to work; he had to agree to this. \"So let me get this straight,\" said Johnny eventually \"We do a one nightnboost, from say 8pm till 8am, stealin' as many cars as we can?\" \"Yep,\" answered Memphis \"And the winner of the bet is the team that has thenmost moneys worth of cars in their garage at the end of it.\" \"So we'd be aiming for all the top-end cars?\" \"Well yeah, that would make sense. You can steal as many cars as you like,nbut you have to have the highest cash total, deducting any repairs thatnwould need to be made at the end of it all.\" The line went silent again. Memphis looked over at Sway and she stared backnat him, expectantly. \"OK.\" Johnny answered eventually. \"What? You'll do it.\" \"Yeah boy, I'll do it.\" Memphis gave Sway and the rest of the team a thumbs-up, and silent highnfives were thrown. \"So when?\" asked Memphis. \"How bout Friday night.\" *** Memphis and Sway didn't get back to their apartment until 1.30am. AfternMemphis had finished his conversation with Johnny, there had been a short-nlived celebration before they all went home. Memphis unlocked the door and flicked on the lights. He walked over to thenbig leather sofa where Sway had been sitting just over 3 hours ago furiousnwith him, and leant back, closing his eyes, savoring the comfort. He listened to Sway as she threw her jacket over the back of a chair andnwalked towards the kitchen.nIt was a habit that, at first had annoyed him, he had bugged her hundredsnof times about hanging her coat up, but one day had come home to find theirnentire wardrobe piled up on the same chair. He never tried again, she wasnstubborn, a strong character that took a lot of breaking. Which was exactlynwhy it pained him to see that this was getting to her so intently. He knew that she had been smoking, and that fact almost panicked him. Swaynhadn't smoked for years. Hadn't needed to. He heard her open the refrigerator door and pop the top off two beers. Shenreturned to the living room and flopped down next to him on the sofa,nhanding him a drink. They sat in silence together for a few minutes,nenjoying the relaxing feeling that the alcohol induced. Then Sway suddenly drained what was left of her beer, stood up and heavednthe bottle at the wall with all the force she could muster. \"FUCKIN' SLIMEY BASTARD!\" She shouted making Memphis jump, \"What the hellndoes he think he's trying to pull! I'll kill him, I swear to god I'll killnthe mother fucker!\" Memphis laughed at her outburst, he couldn't help it. Tempers he could dealnwith. Tempers were very Sway, cold, hard and not to be messed with. She stared at him icily and then began to laugh herself, dropping back downninto her seat. \"We're gonna kick his ass.\" She said matter-of-factly crossing her feet onnthe coffe table in front of them. \"Yeah we are.\" Memphis grinned at her and a small wicked smile pulled atnthe corner of her lips. \"Yeah we are.\" She repeated as she swiped Memphis's beer off him and took anlong swig. ***End chapter 5***[Chapter 7] Chapter 6. . 47 hours to bet . Memphis wandered around the garage taking control of all that was going onnaround him. He watched as Sway went through reams and reams of car listsnwith a highlighter pen marking off the most expensive ladies. He directednKip as he searched the net looking for all the high-class car sales, henhelped Donny find every Starbucks, every Savoy hotel and every top-endnapartment block in the area. He was nervous, he knew that the amount of cars that they had already foundnwas more than sufficient for the purpose, and any more would be impossiblento steal within the time limit, but he had to cover every angle. Hencouldn't fail. He took a break from being leader and stood at a blackboard writing downnthe cars that Sway shouted over to him. \"Jaguar XKE. Jaguar S type. Aston martin DB7. Dodge viper RT/10,\" The dodge earned a little cheer of approval from Kip, Sway smiled andncontinued down the list. \"Lincoln Limo. Porsche 911,\" Another cheer, this time from Tumbler and for the Porsche. \"Porsche Boxter,\" \"Yeh baby!\" Answered Donny \"Lamborghini Countach!\" They all let out whoops, Memphis smiled to himself as he wrote the car downnon the board. \"Lamborghini Diablo!\" They all cheered again. Memphis laughed and looked at Sway who had suddenlyndipped her eyebrows. She licked her lips and said in a deep husky voicenbarely above a whisper, \"Ferrari F40.\" \"Yeh, you do!\" shouted Mirror man \"That is my kind of car man!\" Sway was still looking at Memphis breathing deeply, pupils dilated. Hensmiled at the effect the Italian stallion had on her. Even to mention thenmake of a Ferrari reduced her to a smoldering wreck. She cleared her throat and continued down her list. The others got back onnwith their work, fun over. Memphis couldn't help but notice that every carnshe read out brought a small smile to Sways lips. *** . 40 Hours to bet . Sway sat at the same desk she had been at for the past 7 hours. Stacks ofnpaper strewn around in front of her, her fifth highlighter pen running lownon ink. She rubbed her eyes in exhaustion and leaned back in her chair. \"Hey Sway!\" Called Tumbler from across the garage \"slacking already girl?\" She gave him the finger and hunched back over the papers. Memphis wandered wirily over to her and draped an arm over her shoulder. \"Want to go for a spin?\" He murmured into her hair \"Clear your head.\" She smiled and turned around in the chair to face him. \"Definitely.\" \"I'll get my keys.\" He said grinning. \"Aaawww!\" A voice from the other side of the room made them all turn andnlook \"Can I come too!?\" \"Hey Rach.\" Chuckled Sway. Memphis looked at the girl leaning casually against the doorframe andnsmiled. He could have picked her out of a crowd as one of Sways friends. She was tall, at about 5ft8\", with long dark hair that hung in soft,neffortless curls down her back. Her lithe figure sported a pair of lownwaisted black leather pants, and a short khaki green tank top. This leftnthe majority of her midriff bare, displaying a large tattoo of the Harleyneagle on her right hip. She also wore one of those, don't-you-dare-mess-nwith-me-or-I'll-rip-your-head-off expressions that he saw every day onnSway's face. She winked coyly at Memphis and raised the cigarette she was holding up tonher lips taking a long deep drag.n\"You were right,\" She said turning her attention to Sway \"very cute!\" Memphis raised his eyebrows and looked at Sway. \"Always wanted a mustang.\" Added Rachel making Memphis smile. \"You didn't have to come.\" Said Sway swinging her legs up onto the desk innfront of her. Rachel walked over to the two of them and let her eyes linger over thenblackboard behind them. \"Oh, but I did.\" She said a wicked little grin creeping across hernbeautiful features as she took in the ladies written upon it. \"Sixth one down,\" Said Sway automatically, gesturing over her shoulder. \"Oh, shit.\" Rachel murmured in the same voice, and with the same expressionnthat Sway had done when reading out the Ferrari. Memphis laughed quietly to himself as Rachel flung herself over the end ofnthe desk. She was a dark haired version of Sway. \"Rachel is a big, big fan of anything Porsche.\" Explained Sway. Rachel heldnup her wrist displaying a tattoo of the rearing horse from the Porschenlogo. \"Yeah, and especially anything with the numbers 9, 1 and 1 in it also.\" Shenadded. The girls laughed. \"I'll take you for a spin anytime baby.\" Interjected Tumbler suddenly. They both stopped laughing abruptly and turned sharply to look at him.. \"Yeah?\" Cooed Rachel sweetly. \"Yeah.\" He nodded. \"Try it, and I'll cut off your balls and feed em to ya! You get me?\" Herntone of voice had suddenly taken on an edge that made tumbler step backnrapidly, and if looks could kill. \"Rachel, Tumbler. Tumbler, Rachel.\" Introduced Sway as Tumbler slowly creptnback into the shadows. \"Yeah.\" Said Rachel keeping her eyes on his retreated form. \"And that one over there's Donny,\" Said Sway Donny raised his hat. She gestured over to the others \"Otto, he owns this place\" \"How you doing girl?\" Greeted Otto \"That's Sphinx,\" Sphinx nodded silent as ever. \"Freb,\" Freb grinned stupidly and a strange squeaking noise was all that henmanaged to muster. \"Mirror man is the little homie in the shades\" \"Hey! Enough of the little girl.\" Mirror man smiled charmingly at Rachelnand bowed his head \"That's kip, Memphis's brother, and incase you hadn't already noticed,nthis,\" She added, turning to face him \"is Memphis.\" Rachel shook his hand with a surprisingly strong grip. \"So,\" Said Memphis \"Can you boost a car?\" Rachel laughed. \"What'd you think?\" She grinned. *** End chapter 6 ***[Chapter 8] Chapter 7. . 37 hours to bet . Memphis had taken over from Sway on highlighter duty after he could see itnwas getting to her. She had begun to rub her eyes every few seconds and wasngetting frustrated with herself. After the third heavy object sailed fromnthe desk and landed with a thump on the floor followed by an anguished crynfrom Sway he had relived her and set her on another task. And now, after annhour at the desk he could see why she had been so strained. His eyes seemedncompletely reluctant to focus on the paper in front of him, so all of thentext was merging into one black blur. He had highlighted several ladies atnonce accidentally so many times he had lost count, and was amazed hownSway's immeasurably short fuse had lasted nearly nine hours hunched overnthis desk without throwing anything more harmless than a stapler. He rubbed his tired eyes for the hundredth time, and lent back in the chairnexhausted. A familiar, gentle arm snaked its way around his neck and Sway'snbreath was hot on the back of his neck as she spoke. \"Tough work eh?\" \"Mmmm.\" He murmured kissing her arm softly \"How the hell did you managenthis for nine hours!?\" She spun the swivel chair around so that he was facing her and shrugged. \"I threw things.\" She said matter-of-factly. This brought a grin to Memphis's features, and he pulled her face downntowards his and kissed her. A voice from across the room interrupted their intimate moment. \"Jeez! Get a room will ya, people are trying to eat here!\" Sway looked upnand smirked at Rachel who had a sandwich paused halfway to her mouth. Memphis laughed softly and Sway looked back down at him. \"I think now would be just about the perfect time to go for that spin don'tnyou think?\" He asked her. \"Yeah.\" She smiled and reached down pulling his keys from the front pocketnof his worn black jeans. He raised an eyebrow at her and she sent him a coy smile, the Ferrari looknsinking back into her eyes. \"I think now would also be a good time to go home.\" She whispered headilyninto his ear. *** After he had cleared away his papers and told everyone to finish up and gonhome, Memphis hurried out of the garage after Sway who had left a couple ofnminutes earlier. He found her loitering against the hood of the mustang,nhands in pockets, staring down at a small fragment of twisted blacknfiberglass on the ground. He knew exactly where it had come from.nJosephine. She looked up as she heard him approaching and offered him a weak smile. \"You okay baby?\" He asked as reached her and slid his arms around hernwaist. \"I'm fine,\" She said indignantly, crushing the black shard under the heelnof her Doc and looking smolderingly into his eyes \"But if you don't get menhome soon I won't be held responsible for my actions.\" \"Really?\" He asked as she brought her lips up to his and kissed himnhungrily. Her hands slowly traveled up under the back of his shirt and hencould feel her nails digging gently into his flesh. The kiss deepened ofnits own accord until Memphis pulled away breathing heavily. \"Get in the car.\" He said and Sway grinned running around to the passengerndoor and sliding into the seat next to him. *** Rachel watched from the doorway as Memphis's mustang pulled out of thendrive and peeled off around the corner. She sighed as she watched thencouple go, hoping to god that this crazy plan would work. She knew how muchnthat guy meant to her friend and to loose him in any way would ruin her. Stepping out of the garage and walking down the drive, a sultry smilenreturned to Rachel's lips as her baby came into view before her. \"Hey there Maria!\" She said as she stroked the roof of her flame red 1984nPorsche 911. It had taken her over 3 years to save up for the very wellnused second hand classic, and a further year's love and restoration to makenit drivable, but now she had it she wouldn't give it up for the world. Shenhad fully cleaned out the interior adding expensive hints of chrome andnpolished wood, and had also spent a lot of time, effort and money turningnher from the original lime green to the sexy red she gleamed in today. It was her dream come true, she owned something she had wanted her wholenlife. An original Porsche 911.nSomeone let out a whistle from behind her making her turn back around innthe direction of the garage. \"Man, that is one mighty fine looking honey you got there girl.\" It wasnDonny. He took off his black hat and approached her and Maria to get anbetter look. Rachel smiled proudly as he inspected her car with awe. \"What is this?\" He asked, as he looked over her interior \"an 84?\" \"Yessir!\" Answered Rachel polishing a smudge off the front right headlamp. \"This is in great condition!\" \"You should have seen it when I bought it.\" Laughed Rachel. \"Wow girl you've got talent,\" Said Donny straightening up to talk to hern\"You should let Otto see the work you've done here he's always after newnrestorers.\" \"Thanks,\" Said Rachel letting herself into the driver seat \"but I'm gettingnalong fine.\" \"Just a thought.\" Smiled Donny placing his hat back on his head andnshutting the door for her. She sent him a two-fingered salute through the window and pulled out of thendrive. \"Wow.\" Said Donny to himself as he watched the Porsche snake sleekly aroundnthe corner and away \"that is some girl.\" *** As they approached the freeway, Memphis looked over at Sway. She had hernhead back against the restraint and her eyes were drooping softly closed.nHe smiled to himself and turned his attention back to the road. Withoutnbeing behind the wheel herself, driving at night had always sent Sway tonsleep in a matter of minutes. Memphis cut off the engine after pulling into a spot in their lot andnlooked over at her again. She was breathing softly her chest movingnrhythmically up and down, her intentions from earlier long forgotten. Henreached over and brushed a stray strand of hair off her face. \"Sway\" He whispered. \"Mmmmm?\" She muttered not opening her eyes. Memphis kissed her brow softly \"Come on baby we're home. Wake up.\"n\"Mm.\" She opened her eyes and looked around herself disorientated. \"What?\" \"We're home.\" He got out of the car and walked around to undo the passengerndoor. Sway groggily undid her seatbelt and dragged her heavy limbs from the car.nClicking the lock button on his key remote Memphis wrapped a steadying armnaround his girlfriend's waist. \"Come on.\" He said, \"Lets get you inside.\" By the time they had walked the distance up the stairs to their 2nd floornapartment, Sway had woken up and stood yawing as Memphis unlocked the doornand flicked on the lights. She followed him inside and flung her jacketnover the back of the armchair, he instinctively moved and picked it up, asnhe always did, hanging it on the back of the door with his own. In the time it took him to turn back around Sway had disappeared into thenkitchen and he could hear the refrigerator door being opened. She returnednwith two beers and sat down on the sofa to drink hers. \"Are you sure you're okay?\" Memphis asked as he sat down next to her andntook the second beer from her hand. \"Yes Memphis!\" She snapped \"Jesus man will you stop asking me. I'm fine.\" He looked at her for a second but didn't push it. She'd had a long hardnday, and he knew her limits, and what was beyond them. They sat in silence drinking for a few more minutes before Sway finishednhers and set the empty bottle down on the coffee table. \"I'm goin to bed.\" She said standing up and stretching out \"You coming?\" \"I'll be there in a sec babe.\" He replied shaking his nearly empty drinkn\"Just gonna finish this.\" \"Okay.\" She leant down and kissed hi briefly on the lips before walkingnaway in the direction of their bedroom. As he watched her go, Memphis couldn't shake the feeling that there wasnsomething wrong. She was far to quiet. He had never expected tears, Swayndidn't cry, but he had at least been prepared for shouting, screaming, anynway for her to release the aggression he knew she was harboring. He wasnused to being her punch bag, of course not literally, but if she needed tonlet off steam he usually bore the brunt of it. Sway threw things, shenswore, she never, went to bed early if she was frustrated, and she never,never, did so quietly. He drained what was left of his drink, cleared away the empty bottles andnpadded into the bedroom after Sway. She already appeared to be asleep as he walked in. He couldn't quite decidenif she actually was. He stood above her for a second, gently twisting anblonde dreadlock around his finger, watching her breathing softly.nSomething was up, and he knew that soon enough he was going to find outnwhat it was, and had a feeling he wasn't going to like it. ***End chapter 7***[Chapter 9] Chapter 8. . 28 Hours to bet . Something jarred Memphis awake. Dragging his mind from its hazy cloud ofnsleep, he groggily opened his eyes and tried to focus on the blinking redndigits of his alarm clock. 4am. He rolled over to see what the hell wasngoing on at 4 in the morning, only to encounter cool sheets besides him. \"Sway?\" He mumbled. \"Go back to sleep Memphis.\" Sway voice drifted over from the other side ofnthe room. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, wondering why Sway was not where she shouldnbe, only to find her standing at their wardrobe, fully dressed, stuffingnclothes into a small hold-all. Now he was awake. \"Sway what are you doing?\" He asked warily. \"Nothing,\" she muttered indignantly \"Go back to sleep.\" The shit had hit the fan. Memphis knew it would soon enough. He pulled backnthe covers and rose from the bed. \"Sway.\" He said to her turned back. She didn't reply, and instead continued to pull clothes from the closet andnforcefully ram them into the black bag. \"Sway.\" He repeated. \"Go, back, to sleep.\" Sway voice had a tone to it now that Memphis knew allntoo well. She was trying intensely to keep her cool, and sounded as if shenwas talking through clenched teeth. Although it was suicide, he knew he hadnto keep pushing her, she needed to snap. So he repeated in the same calm voice that grated on Sway so badly. \"Sway.\" \"WHAT!\" She turned towards him, and threw the now full bag in his directionn\"What the hell do you want!?\" He raised his hands \"I just want to know what you're doing, packing a hold-nall at 4 in the morning.\" \"Well, why don't you just go back to sleep and leave me to what ever it isnI might be doing!\" \"I doubt that's a good idea.\" He was managing well to maintain his calmnexterior and could see the red hot anger boiling up behind Sway'sncontrasting icy eyes. \"OH FOR FUCKSAKES MEMPHIS!\" She screamed at him \"Quit with the preachernwill you!\" She stormed around the bed to where he was standing and snatchednup her bag from his feet. As she rose back up from the ground, Memphis grabbed her arm. She flippednher head up and looked scathingly into his eyes. She was breathing deeply,nher hair all over her face, and Memphis could see the fire burning behindnher gaze. \"Get the hell off me.\" She hissed through her teeth. He prepared himself, and said in his quiet patronizing voice, \"No.\" He managed to duck just in time to miss her right hook and clambered overnthe bed to the other side to avoid a second forceful swing. \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!\" She screamed \"What's wrong with me!?\" His calm facade had cracked and Memphis decided itnwas time to let off his own steam \"You're the one packing a bag at 4am innthe Goddamn morning!\" \"Yeah well,\" She picked up the bag from where she had dropped it and swungnit over her shoulder \"You don't have to worry about that anymore becausenI'm done!\" And with that she stormed from the room. Memphis suddenly felt a well ofnpanic rise up inside him. \"Sway?\" He jumped over the bed and followed her \"Sway what are you doing?\" \"Leaving Memphis. I would have thought that might have been obviousnenough!\" \"What!?\" He ran and caught up with her before she reached the door \"Wherenare you going? You can't!\" \"Just watch me boy scout.\" She muttered as she began to unlock the frontndoor. \"I won't let you go.\" He ran around in front of her and put himself betweennher and the door, his back pressed hard against it. She closed her eyes and took a deep shaky breath. \"Move out of the way Memphis.\" He shook his head \"I'm not letting you out of here.\" Her breathing started to increase again. \"Move out, of the way.\" \"No.\" \"Memphis. Move out of the Goddamn way!\" Her voice had started to risenagain. \"I'm not going to let you just walk out!\" He shouted back. \"DO YOU WANT ME TO SWING FOR YOU AGAIN!?\" \"FINE!\" Memphis threw his arms up in the air \"HIT ME, SEE IF I GIVE AnSHIT!\" \"DON'T TEMPT ME MEMPHIS!\" \"GO ON THEN!\" Sway drew back her arm in anger. \"You can hit me as hard as you like!\" Memphis stared her right in the eyen\"But I'm never going to let you leave me like this!\" Sway drew shaky breaths through clenched teeth and pulled her fist backnfurther. She looked into Memphis's desperate gaze and something inside hernsnapped. She couldn't stand this, deep inside him; she could see hownpanicked Memphis was that she might leave him. Memphis drew a sigh of relief as he watched Sway's eyes soften and her handndrop to her side. She sunk to her knees and did something which terrifiednhim to his very being. She cried. He had seen her cry before, but never properly. This time it was more thannjust a few tears, she was really crying, really hurting. He dropped downnwith her. \"Sway? Baby?\" he reached out to touch her arm, but she pushed him away. \"Get the hell away from me!\" \"Sway.\" He placed his hand under her chin and tilted her face up tonencounter tear-streaked cheeks. \"I just can't do this Memphis.\" She sobbed, \"I can't. I'm so sorry, I havento get out of here.\" She reached up and brushed a light finger over his lips. \"God Memphis, whatndid we do to deserve this?\" He shook his head gently and kissed the palm of her hand. \"Please don'tnleave me Sway.\" He looked desperately into her eyes \"I need you.\" \"I just can't do this Memphis, it's so hard! Seeing you and the guysnbrought into all this again. Kip was doing so well until all this started.nI hate it!\" She angrily brushed the tears from her face \"And it's allnbecause of me!\" Memphis shook his head again \"How many times do I have to tell you Sway, itncould have been any one of you! You're all just a way to get at me! Younleaving won't stop anything, he'll just pick someone else.\" \"Yeah, but then it won't be my fault anymore will it? And I know that's sonselfish of me, but I just can't sit back and watch all this happen.\" \"You don't think it's hard for me too!? When this actually is my fault!\" \"Nobody blames you Memphis.\" \"Nobody blames you either!\" \"Uggghhh!\" Sway jumped to her feet in frustration, and was quickly followednby Memphis \"We're just going round in circles here!\" He grabbed her hand \"Please Sway. You can't go.\" He stared at her imploringly for what seemed like a lifetime until shenfinally shook her head. \"I'm not going anywhere Memphis.\" \"Oh thank God.\" He sighed pulling her into his arms. She rested her head against his chest and wrapped her arms around hisnwaist. How could she even consider doing this to him? She couldn't imaginenher reaction if she woke up in the middle of the night to have him announcenthat he was leaving her. Something inside her clicked, she was never goingnto leave and doubted she could if she'd wanted to; she needed to donsomething about this. Memphis lightly kissed the top of her head \"I love you Sway, you know thatnright?\" He mumbled into her hair \"And you don't have to do this if youndon't want to.\" She nodded gently \"You can just stay here and have myndinner waiting for me when I get home!\" She pushed him backwards and playfully punched him in the shoulder \"Dreamnon sweetheart!\" He smiled at her \"You comin' back to bed baby?\" \"Not yet.\" She said picking up her keys from the floor \"I have to go donsomething first.\" A look of alarm sprang behind his eyes. She held up her hands \"Don't worry!nI'm coming back.\" She handed him the hold-all \"Unpack this for me willnyou?\" He leaned in and kissed her \"With pleasure!\" Sway grinned and opened the door \"I'll be back soon okay?\" \"Okay.\" Memphis watched as the door swung shut behind her and then walkednover to the couch, collapsing down into a seat. He sat back and closed hisneyes, running his hands over his face, the realization of what he hadnalmost lost washing over him. Johnny was going to pay for this. The sound of Sway Corvette springing to life and pulling out of the lotnbelow filled the room. Memphis knew exactly where she was going. *** End chapter 8 ***[Chapter 10] Chapter 9. Rachel flicked absentmindedly through the TV channels, swigging a beer asnshe did so. This was the problem with always being awake at this time, youncould have the best channels that money could buy, but still there wasnnever anything on past 2am. Rachel had been diagnosed with insomnia a fewnyears earlier; she was given medication but never took it. She had alwaysnfelt that she didn't need it, a couple of hours sleep a day kept her sane.nThis time, between about 1 and 5am, was her resting time; she would justnsit in a conscious sate of sleep that served her fine before she dozed offnfor her daily, 2-hour fix. A knocking at her door pulled her more physically awake. She glanced overnat the clock 4:48. Who the hell else would be awake at this time, shenwondered as she padded across the room. She drew back the lock and pullednopen the door to reveal a disheveled looking Sway standing behind it. Hernhair was tousled all over her face, her eyes bloodshot, stricken panicndrawn all over her features. Basically, she looked like hell. \"You have to help me Rach. I think I'm cracking up.\" *** \"Remind me again what we're doing here.\" Commented Sway as Rachel pullednher 911 up to the door of Otto's garage. \"We're fixing you hun!\" Sway laughed and climbed out of the car, she pulled her keys out of hernpocket and threw them to Rachel who unlocked the door and flicked on thenlights. \"I've already been here today Rach, it didn't make me feel any better thennand sorry to burst your bubble but it aint doin now either.\" \"Shut the hell up and get your ass over here will you!\" Sway walked over to where Rachel sat on the edge of the desk, her eyebrowsnraised. \"What?\" \"Sit!\" Commanded Rachel. Sway sat down cynically. \"Now,\" Said Rachel \"look ahead of you and tell me what you see.\" Sway looked up at the blackboard that she had been writing on not 12 hoursnago. \"I see a blackboard containing the names of a whole bunch of expensivenpieces of tin that are ruining my life!\" \"Slap your wrist girl!\" Gasped Rachel with mock shock \"That's sacrilege,nthere's a Porsche up on there!\" Sway laughed and shook her head \"Seriously Rach, their nothing specialnreally, aint worth shit in the real world-\" \"Oh dear God,\" Moaned Rachel her head in her hands \"Its worse than Inthought, you really are cracking up, you've lost your faith in cars!\" Sway glanced back up at the board \"And the funny thing is I don't careneither.\" \"Are you trying to make me cry!?\" Rachel jumped up and stabbed thenchalkboard with her finger. \"Look at it Sway!\" Sway shrugged indifferently. \"Okay that's it! Who are you and what have you done with my Sway?\" Sway laughed, Rachel was one of the funniest people she had ever met. Shenwas so laid back, nothing fazed her. She sat and watched her lighting up ancigarette absentmindedly scanning the car names a look of hunger behind herneyes. She stood with the confidence of a person who really knew how to looknafter themselves, and wore a permanent \"Don't give me any shit look\". Asnshe watched her taking a long drag on her cigarette Sway realizednsomething. This was her! If the tables were turned and she was second partynin somebody else's nightmare, this would be exactly like her. It was whonSway was, get on with it, get it sorted. Rachel sat back down next to her and offered her a smoke. She took one andnas she lit it Rachel gestured at the board again. \"I know that this is hard for you Sway, but this is so unlike you. Look atnwhat we have here. Its great!\" Sway smiled her trademark wicked little grin. \"I know.\" \"Think of it this way,\" Said Rachel \"You're like a nun right?\" \"What!? Yeah right!\" \"You are, you're like a nun, a nun who is just going to have one wild nightnof passion! And if you're going to break the rules you might as well do itnproperly! No drunken old men, what you have here my friend is a bunch ofngorgeous hotties!\" \"That is a good metaphor!\" laughed Sway. \"If you're gonna do it wrong babe,\" Rachel winked at her and then lookednback at the board \"Do it right!\" Sway laughed and threw her cigarette butt to the floor. \"Seriously Sway,\" Rachel put a hand on her friends shoulder \"What'snhappened to you? This is not Sway. That,\" She pointed at the board \"isnSway. You need to let go. Have you seen how many Italians there are upnthere?! We are going to do this, we're gonna steal some cars, have some funnand make some money. What's to be depressed about?!\" Sway grinned a slow sultry smile as she took in what was written beforenher, it was as if the names were finally coming into focus and some startednto jump out at her, the familiar feeling of passion welling up inside her. Rachel continued to talk \"You just have to close your eye's Sway, forgetnall that this stands for and think of the here and now. Have your fling!nThe adrenaline as you creep up to her, the feel of the cool metal, thensmell as you pop the hood, the noise as you rev her up, the-\" \"Alright, alright!\" Sway jumped up laughing \"Jesus girl what are you tryingnto do to me.\" \"Woo!\" Cheered Rachel \"Ladies and gentleman it appears that Sway hasnentered the building!\" The two women sat back down and lit up another cigarette each, not oncentaking their eyes of the board. \"I can't believe you called them 'expensive pieces of tin'\" Mumbled Rachelnbreaking a long silence. \"If you ever tell anyone that, I will take a big sharp rock, and drag itnalong the right wing of pretty little Maria out there!\" \"Now that would be sacrilege!\" Grinned Rachel. *** Memphis heard the door to the apartment click open at about 5:30am. It wasnfollowed by the familiar swish of Sway jacket against the back of thenchair. She crept into the bedroom, undressed and climbed into bed next to him. Hensnaked a gentle arm around her waist and she sighed and snuggled in to him. \"How you feelin' baby?\" He asked kissing the top of her head. She looked up at him and grinned. \"I'm feeling,\" she said huskily \"like wenstill have some unfinished business to attend to from earlier.\" \"Is that so?\" He teased. \"Oh yeah.\" She said as she lent in and kissed him passionately. Memphis wasn't sure what Rachel had said to her, but what ever it was itnhad worked. Sway was back, no doubt about it. *** End chapter 9 ***[Chapter 11] Chapter 10. .25 hours to bet. Less than two hours later, Memphis was harshly pulled from his restfulnslumber by the unwelcome blare of his alarm. Muttering a few choice wordsnhe banged his palm on the top of the obtrusive machine trying to hit thensnooze button. His sleep-deprived mind was having some trouble and afternabout 10 hellish seconds of noise, Sway's hand flew across his chest. Shengrabbed the alarm and pulled it sharply downward, ripping the wires fromnits base and dropping the broken object to the floor, before settlingngently back onto her pillows. Memphis smiled to himself and closed his eyes deciding to savor 5 morenblissful minutes. *** .23 hours to bet. Memphis and Sway bustled into the garage ½ an hour later than the rest ofnthe gang arrived. \"Sorry!\" Memphis apologized as he shrugged out of his jacket \"we slept in.\" \"Yeah I'll bet you did.\" Muttered Rachel ginning lewdly at Sway who simplynraised her eyebrows. \"So then boss,\" said Mirror Man popping the last of a pop tart into hisnmouth \"what's the plan for today?\" \"Today we scout.\" Memphis addressed them all \"We need to find all the carsnoff the list.\" \"Holy shit. That's one big list you know?' \"I know, I know. We just have to do our best.\" He turned to Tumbler \"Younget the mini vans I asked for?\" \"Four. Just like you asked. Tinted windows, the works.\" \"Good man. Okay guys listen up. These are your crews, and the cars on yournlists.\" *** Less than 30 minutes later the crew was on the road. 3 teams of two and anteam of three rode together. Mirror man and Tumbler in one van, Donny andnsphinx in another, kip and Freb in another and in the final black vannRachel, Memphis and Sway cruised the streets. Otto and Junie stayed behindnthe scenes at the garage keeping things ticking over smoothly. Each teamnhad a full car list from the previous days work, 20 of those cars werenhighlighted for each group. The whole operation was kept together by a setnof 5 way walkie-talkies, this way nobody missed a beat. For a couple of long hours, the only voices riding the airwaves, were thosenof teams verifying finds and Otto's voice confirming them. It was gettingnboring. This had always been Sways least favorite part of boosting. Thenprep she didn't really mind, but the shop she hated. There was nonadrenaline rush to keep it interesting, nothing illegal in taking picturesnof a couple of peoples cars. She'd had enough. She picked up their walkie-talkie off the dash andnpressed the button. \"TV car trivia?\" She asked. Several exasperated reply's all came at once. \"Hell yes!\"n\"Damn I though no-one was gonna ask\"n\"I'm dying of boredom here!\" Sway heard Otto laugh in appreciation. \"Nice one Sway. You want to startnus off kid?\" \"Ok. Hmmm. Oh I got one!\" she looked across at Memphis and grinned. \"What'snthe car on the back of the 10 dollar bill?\" \"There's a car on the back of the 10 dollar bill?\" Donny asked. \"The hell there is!\" Snorted Tumbler Sway laughed as she heard the rustle of various notes being pulled out ofnpeople's pockets. \"Hey. Goddamn girl you right! There is a car here!\" Mirror man said,nimpressed. \"Yeah but what the hell is this thing?\" Asked Kip. \"Nothin,\" Answered Sway \"That's the thing. They couldn't endorse any onencar, it's a composite.\" \"That's a good one Sway!\" Otto congratulated \"I think so too!\" She grinned. \"Ah stop being such a damn show off.\" Rachel elbowed her. \"Ok then!\" Otto enthused \"Who's next? Donny?\" *** .18 hours to bet. \"Ok.\" Said Sway running her finger down the now tattered piece of papernwhich served as her team's list \"Next up we have, yeah baby!\" She grinnednat Rachel \"Ferrari F40!\" \"Oooooh! I call it!\" Said Memphis raising his hand. \"The hell you do,\" Sway raised an eyebrow at him \"unless you wanna findnyourself single and living out of a box on a front stoop!\" He chuckled and turned his eyes back to the road, pulling in just down fromnthe eighth Starbucks they had visited that day. \"Bingo.\" Rachel pointed across the street to where a tall dark guy climbednout of a sleek red F40 and ran across the road to the coffee house. \"Lovely.\" Sway breathed. \"I hope you're talking about the car!\" Memphis said. \"Of course, Dahling!\" She sent him her most innocent look and grinned \"Ok,nhere I go.\" She reached for her door handle. \"Wait wait wait!\" Rachel grabbed her elbow \"Take off your coat.\" Sway handed Rachel her gray duster obligingly. \"That's better,\" Rachel commented \"Oh, but,\" She reached across and undidnthe top two buttons of Sway already precariously low cut black shirtn\"Bingo!\" Sway blew a kiss to an openmouthed Memphis and jumped out of the van. \"Did you have to do that?\" Memphis asked Rachel as he watched hisngirlfriend push open the door to the Starbucks. \"Yep!\" *** Sway quickly scanned the room for Ferrari boy as she stepped inside thenwarm coffee house. The smell in the room was making her realize that shenhadn't had caffeine in over 4 hours. She spotted him, standing at the endnof the bar, waiting for his drink. Play time! She sauntered across the room just as he picked up his coffee and turnednaround, making sure that he banged right into her. \"Hey!\" She shouted as the hot liquid splashed down the front of her shirt. \"Oh god,\" he muttered \"I'm so sorry. Are you okay?\" She looked up into his face and realized that he was actually quite cute. Ancomplete asshole judging by the suit the car and the hairdo, but stillnquite cute. Time to turn on the charm. \"I'm fine,\" She smiled apologetically \"Sorry I yelled at you, but its beenna very long day!\" \"Tell me about it.\" He sent her a slimy grin, and she had to wonder if thisnguy had ever had a hard day in his life or if Daddy dearest had a hand innthe F40 parked across the street. She sent him a sultry grin and smoothed a hand over her damp shirt. \"I tell you what,\" He pulled a silver pen out of his top pocket \"How bout Ingive you my number and you can send me the bill for your dry-cleaning?\" God this guy was gross. She leaned into him and whispered into his ear \"This shirt doesn't need dryncleaning.\" \"You sure?\" He twisted a dreadlock around his finger briefly. Sway raised her eyebrows, held out her hand to him and he wrote his numberndown on it, the whole time never taking his eyes off her chest. Definitely an asshole. *** Memphis gripped the steering wheel of the van as he watched the tall darknsuit in the coffee shop slowly scrawl something down on the back of hisngirlfriends hand. \"My god,\" Said Rachel \"That guy is looking right down her top.\" \"I know!\" Muttered Memphis through clenched teeth. \"Clam down hunny! Look, she's coming now.\" They watched as Sway ran back down the street and jumped back into the van. \"You get it?\" Asked Rachel. Sway held out her hand and smiled triumphantly. \"Otto,\" She said into the walkie-talkie as Memphis started the engine \"Wengot a plate on Nadine and I need you to run an address chase on thisnnumber.\" ***End Chapter 10***[Chapter 12] Chapter 11. .17 hours to bet. By 4pm most of the crews were up to at least the 15th car on their listsnand nearly ready to call it a day. All that remained were the tricky ones,nironically the ones that they needed the most, as they tended to be thenmost expensive. *nDonny watched from their van as Sphinx followed an employee at a dealershipnaround the side of the building, to return a couple of minutes laternwearing a too tight uniform and sporting a slightly reddened fist. He thenndisappeared through the door of an \"employees only\" section to later returnnwith the plates of three expensive ladies. *nKip and Freb cruised slowly down a well respected neighborhood on beat upnold skate boards, their speed enabling them to scrawl down numbers on thenback of their hands as they went. *nMirror Man and Tumbler circled the car park of a particularly pricey hotelnin search of the Rolls that had been allocated to them. *nRachel sighed as Memphis pulled their truck up across the street from thenplace she had been looking forward to most. The Porsche dealership. Not only was this her favorite place it was also her favorite scout as shengot to do something much more fun than writing down numbers on a piece ofnpaper. \"You ready Rach?\" Asked Sway \"Oh yeah!\" Rachel climbed into the back of the van and changed her clothesnfor the ones that Sway passed over to her. A tiny black skirt, a red silknblouse and stilettos. \"You turn around whilst I'm changing and I'll kill you Memphis Raines.\" Shenwarned. \"Not if I do first.\" Muttered Sway. Memphis held up his hands \"I didn't do anything!\" \"Good job.\" Rachel said as she fasted her hair up with two blacknchopsticks. \"Okay! I'm done. What do ya think?\" She posed for Sway whonreached forward, undoing the top two buttons of the shirt. \"I think you look much better now!\" Rachel laughed and Memphis shook his head \"What is it with you two today?\" \"Right then.\" Rachel placed a pair of sunglasses on her head and slung anblack bag over her shoulder \"See ya!\" Sway watched in amusement as Rachel jumped out of the back of the van andnsauntered across the street, wolf whistles following her as she went. Itnwas impossible to tell that Rachel spent most of her life under cars, asnfar as anyone knew, she was just another posh bird with Daddy's credit cardnand a pair of legs. Rachel pushed open the heavy glass door to the showroom and stood lookingnaround, chin in the air. A suited salesman slid up along side her and offered his hand. \"Good afternoon madam. How can I help you?\" She didn't shake his hand and instead lifted her sunglasses from her eyesnand placed them on her head. \"I want to buy a car. All my friends at the society have Porsches now, andnI am so sick of driving around in a BMW they are just soooo last season.\" \"Okay,\" The salesman retracted his hand sheepishly and gestured around thenroom \"What model were you thinking of exactly.\" Rachel exhaled impatiently \"Do I seriously look like I know anything aboutncars?\" She stared at him levelly. \"Well, I -\" \"Listen,\" She paused \"What is your name?\" \"George, madam.\" \"Listen George,\" She stalked away from him and began to sashay around thenroom waving her sunglasses around \"I need a big shiny car that looks goodnand will make all my girlfriends jealous. I don't care what wheels it hasnas long as there are four of them and they're expensive. I don't care whatnmakes it move, as long as it does and it's expensive! I don't care what itnis but I have Daddy's credit card and LOTS of taste, so please,\" She starednat him briefly \"Just show me them all!\" \"Well of course, we don't have every Porsche model here-\" \"Did you not hear me? My Father has given an unlimited budget for this car!nI don't want to see ALL of the models, I want to see the most expensivenones.\" She smiled at him sweetly and pulled Otto's gold card from the bagnshe was carrying, waving it purposely under his nose. \"Well then madam! Lets see what we can do shall we.\" *** Sway and Memphis sat patiently in the van watching Rachel prance around thensales room. Memphis checked his watch, 3:30pm. They had to be back at thengarage in half an hour and Rachel didn't look nearly finished with her nownpetrified looking salesclerk. \"She's good isn't she?\" Said Sway as she watched Rachel through hernpassenger window. \"She's taking her sweet time about it.\" Memphis pulled the sleeve of hisnjacket back down over his watch. \"Lighten up! She's enjoying herself, she'll be done soon.\" \"You've changed you tune.\" He raised his eyebrows at his girlfriend whonsimply shrugged. \"Maybe I'm starting to enjoy myself again. And besides if this all fallsnthrough I have the number of a very rich guy with a Ferrari so I'm setneither way!\" \"Hey!\" Memphis playfully punched her on the arm and she laughed andnclambered over to sit on his knee. \"I also know this other guy who has a very cute little Mustang.\" \"Oh really? And what's he like?\" \"A pain in the ass.\" She mumbled as she leant in and kissed him. They were interrupted seconds later by the passenger door opening. \"Oh Jeez! Will you two get a room already!\" Sway laughed. \"You get them?\" \"Of course!\" She held up some sheets of paper and placed the dark glassesnback over her eyes, \"I mean, Porsches are just soooo this season aren'tnthey!\" *** Back at Otto's, Memphis, Sway, and Rachel were the last team to arrive.nTumbler, Kip, Freb and Mirror Man nearly fell off their chairs as theynwatched Rachel immerge from the van wear a tiny black mini skirt and a halfnunbuttoned shirt. \"She wasn't wearing that this morning was she?\" Mirror Man asked, neverntaking his eyes off her. \"No man. I would have noticed.\" Tumbler replied. The group assembled around the board at the back of the room. \"Okay!\" Said Memphis after inspecting it for a couple of minutes. \"Good jobnguys, we did well. We aren't going to be boosting in daylight so we stillnhave the majority of tomorrow available for last minute prep. We did well,\"nHe repeated \"And I want to thank you again for doing this for me. Again.\" They all laughed and Sway moved next to him and slid an arm around hisnwaist. \"Who's up for a club?\" She asked. ***End Chapter 11***[Chapter 13] Chapter 12. . 1 hour to bet . Memphis sat and stared at the hands of the clock on his bedroom wall asnthey clicked onto 7am. 1 hour to go. Scary. He hadn't slept all night, hadn't been able to. He knew it was stupid, henhad to be awake and alert for another 24 straight hours yet, but he hadnalways got like this before big boosts. It almost brought back a sense ofnnostalgia for years past, sitting there watching the clock, Sway asleepnbesides him. Although the bet was due to start in 1 hour, he had told the crew to have anrest this morning. They would meet up at nine and start the day then. Therenwas no need to be at the garage by 8am, they didn't have much left to do inntheir daylight hours anyway, except sit and wait for the cover of darknessnto fall. He looked back up at the clock. 7.02am. This was going to be a longnmorning. . 20 minutes to bet . Rachel sighed and clicked off the TV. \"I'm gonna call and cancel that crappy cable\" She thought. She never evennwatched it during the day and at night when she sat wide-awake looking fornentertainment; all it did was waste her money. She stood and stretched out her aching muscles. It was 7.43am. She lovednthis time of day, very few others were up and it was quiet and emptynoutside. She decided to take full advantage of that fact and picked up anbasketball from the corner of her living room. The hoop on the driveway ofnher building would soon be swarming with bratty little kids so she left hernapartment to get in 20 good minutes before they woke up. . 10 minutes to bet . Sphinx walked into his kitchen and placed 4 pieces of bacon under thengrill. He looked up at the clock as he sliced up a loaf. 7.48am, the baconnwould be ready at 7.52 and 8 minutes after that, the bet would begin. He shrugged, took a scrap of meat from his refrigerator and made his wayninto his bedroom. He stopped at the window and opened it. A few secondsnlater a big black tomcat appeared on the windowsill and purred at Sphinxnwho placed the ham scrap in front of his regular visitor. . 5 minutes to bet . Kip rolled over in his bed and yawned. He groggily forced his eyes open andnwaited for them to focus on the blinking red digits on his alarm. 7.55am.nOh shit. Five minutes and this all began. Oh shit! What time was hensupposed to be at the garage!? He picked his cell phone up off the floornand hit speed dial 7. Tumbler. . 1 minute to bet . Memphis watched numbly as the second hand traveled slowly around. 55nseconds, 40 seconds, 38 seconds. Sway stirred besides him. He glanced down at her and then back up at thenclock. She pulled herself up against her pillows and swept the hair off hernface. 20 seconds. \"You didn't sleep did you?\" she asked, her voice husky. 15 seconds. \"Nope.\" He shook his head but didn't take his eyes off the clock. Sway sighed and rubbed her eyes. Too many early mornings. After this, shenwas going to go out and get very drunk and then sleep of the hangover for angood couple of days. Memphis drew in a deep breath as the second hand swept up towards 11. 5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3, 2, 1. \"Lets play ball.\" He muttered. . 8.55am . Otto listened to the sound of Sways Corvette pulling up in the driveway. Itnwas unfamiliar. He was so used to hearing the bike. Memphis had already been at the garage for half an hour. Otto had beennexpecting that he would arrive early, he never used to sleep before bignboosts and was always eager to get on with things as soon as possible. Memphis sat at the desk doing final name checks on the ladies, he looked upnas Sway entered and she walked over to sit with him. They were all herennow. All except Rachel. \"Hey Sway!\" Tumbler called out from the back of the room \"Where's that hotnfriend of yours? She bottle it?\" \"Jesus Tumbler its not even nine yet, give her a chance! I only just gotnhere myself, did you think I'd bottled it?\" \"Wouldn't put it past you.\" He muttered under his breath, not quite quietnenough. \"What did you say!?\" Sway leapt up of the desk and stalked towards him. \"Nothing.\" Tumbler raised his hands \"I said nothing.\" \"Didn't sound like nothing to me you dumb f - \" \"Easy Sway.\" Memphis caught her arm form behind \"Just leave it.\" She turned and stared at him, her eyes hard and flecked with the familiarnfire of her anger. \"And tumbler,\" Memphis looked over at him \"Shut the hell up.\" \"Okay, okay! All right man. And sorry Sway baby.\" \"Baby me and you'll be peeing through a catheter!\" Sway glared. They all turned around as Rachel laughed from behind them. \"Well, looksnlike all the fun started without me this morning didn't it!\" *** End chapter 12 ***[Chapter 14] Chapter 13. . 2.15pm . Memphis stood back and scanned the garage. Some of the crew were doing lastnlittle bits of prep, but if he was honest he had to admit that there wasn'tnmuch else to be done. The others sat around impatiently waiting,nanticipation hung heavy in the air around them. Donny stood at the board, hands in pockets, staring at the ladies writtennupon it. Memorizing the names, not that he actually needed to. Boosting asna long career sharpened the memory, especially where car names werenconcerned. For the most part, they used the same names over, but where newncars were concerned there was always a story behind the choice to help jognthe mind. For example, a Ferrari F33 was a new one to make the boostingnlist, named Sara in honor of Sway. Memphis watched Sphinx, enveloped in the shadows as ever, his angularnfeatures accented in the dim light. He stood sharpening and polishing hisnflick blade, alone, silent. Although they occasionally got the odd word outnof him, Memphis sometimes wished he could have a real conversation withnSphinx. As he watched him, he realized that he knew nothing about the mannwho had saved his life and come to aid situations like this more times thannhe could remember. He owed him so much, but never got the chance to repaynhis debts. After this was over, Sphinx would undoubtedly disappear again,nprobably waiting in the shadows until the next time he was called upon. Obviously aware that someone was watching him, Sphinx turned and nodded atnMemphis who offered a weak smile and looked away. Sway was draped across a swivel chair that kip sat in, talking with him,nher head tipped back, dreadlocks brushing the floor as he gently swung thenchair from side to side with his feet. Memphis couldn't help but envy thenfriendship his girlfriend had with kip. They were so comfortable with eachnother, and could sit and talk for hours on end. Although he knew that therenwas nothing to worry about. Sway could dance around naked in front of Kipnand he probably wouldn't even notice! Rachel stood in the doorway chain-smoking and staring into the distancenthrough dark sunglasses. Memphis couldn't help but wonder if she knew hownstunning she actually was, loitering casually against the doorframe, allntattoos, leather and mystery. He smiled to himself as he remembered thenfirst time he'd met Sway.nHe'd been having lots of trouble with some tricky Italian ladies that henneeded for a big order, and someone had given him Sways number. She hadndark hair herself back then, rearing horse on her abdomen, black on blacknensemble and lots of bravado. He thought she was great, and within fivenminutes of meeting her she had knocked him flat on his ass and given him anblack eye. It looked as is Tumbler and Mirror Man were heading for the same fate. Theynhung off her every word as it was and if her mechanical skills lived up tontheir reputation, they would be even worse before the day was through.nTumbler had managed to recover from his near miss with Sway, and if he keptnhis distance he would be fine. They were all just a little hyper charged,nemotions running high. The only problem was the only emotion his littlencrew had managed to muster so far was rage. His chain of thought was broken by a familiar voice from across the room. \"Hey Memphis!\" Sway yelled, looking at him upside-down over the side of thenchair \"What time is it?\" \"About 5 minutes after the last time you asked.\" He replied. \"Argh!\" She sat up in frustration \"This is getting so old! I hate all thisnwaiting around shit!\" \"You're right. Hey everyone!\" Memphis addressed the whole group \"Over herena minute I want a word.\" \"Get up baby.\" Said Kip to Sway \"Show a bit of leg.\" She laughed, got up and pushed Kip over towards where the others werengathering around Memphis. \"Okay guys. I know this is getting dull now, waitin around, but we can't donanything in daylight. I'm sorry but it's just too risky. You know thenrules, if a crewmember gets caught, the other team wins.\" He looked around at the gang most of whom were nodding in agreement. \"You might as well all go out for a few hours. I'll give you one more briefnon the rules now, and then you can leave. Do your own thing 'till aboutn4.00pm, and then come back here. Okay?\" \"Yeah that sounds good man.\" Replied Kip. \"Okay then.\" Memphis sat down on the edge of a desk and folded his armsnacross his chest. \"You all know how much this means to me. We have to winnthis bet, you need to be one hundred percent sure of what's goin onntonight.\" Sway strolled over and sat behind him, her arms around his necknresting her head on his shoulder.n\"Each team can have no more than 10 boosters. We have our 9,\" He nodded atnthem in turn \"Donny, Sphinx, Kip, Mirror, Tumbler, Freb, Rachel and Me andnSway. Otto and Junie are gonna stay behind the scenes to keep thingsnticking over here, and if we need an extra, I've tracked down FrankienFish.\" \"What!\" Sway exclaimed \"I goddamn hate that smarmy piece of shit!\" \"I know.\" Said Memphis turning too look at her \"But we need him Sway, he'sna good boost and we have a space spare.\" \"Hmm.\" Sway frowned but stopped her argument. \"Like I said if any of the10 members get caught its all over.\" He lookednaround to check that everyone was taking what he was saying in. \"We load the cars into two adjacent warehouses down by the pier. This waynwe can keep an eye on the other team and make sure there's no cheatingntaking place. Each team is also to allocate a scout, someone to stay at their warehousenand look after things. Sphinx, you got a guy on that right?\" Sphinx nodded, silently. A slow, simple, head up, down and back to thencenter. Memphis drew in a deep breath. \"This is going to be hard guys. I know we'venprepared all this to the letter, but things can still go wrong okay? Wenhave to be focused. We need as many cars from the list as possible,nstarting with the top ladies, and working our way down.\" He paused for ansecond. \"If anyone wants to back out, now's the time.\" \"We're with you man.\" Nodded Tumbler. \"Hell yeah! Have you seen the girls up there on that list dog?\" Mirror manngestured at the board and whistled \"Sexy, dude!\" Memphis laughed and stood up, Sway dropping down behind him off the deskn\"Okay. Back here at four and remember guys, lay low. We don't want any - \" He was interrupted by someone crashing through the doorway, tripping overnand landing spread eagled, facedown on the floor behind them. They allnturned around and stared over at the panting figure. It was Toby. \"Toby man! What in God's name are you doing here! I told you to stay out ofnthis.\" Kip grasped him by the back off his shirt and hauled him up off thenground. \"I - they - gotta tell you - \" He bent over at the waist and took some deepnbreaths \"Jonny B - \" \"Memphis stepped forward urgently \"What about him?\" \"He's started already. I tell ya, dudes crazy man. Hes boosting. Broadndaylight!\" \"How the hell do you know this Toby?\" Asked Kip accusingly. \"Well I kinda mighta tapped into their phone lines and you know, listened anlittle.\" \"Holy shit Toby! What are you trying to get us caught - \"Kip was cut shortnby Memphis's laughter. He walked over and patted Toby on the back \"Nice work kid.\" He shrugged atnthe rest of the group who were now staring at him open mouthed \"Oh come on!nLike he's not gonna cheat!\" Sway smiled at him. \"Well, what do we do now boss?\" Asked Donny \"Cuz the way I figure it, theyngot what, a 3 and a half hour head start on us?\" \"Yeah.\" Memphis muttered and stood thinking for a second \"Everyone stillnwith me?\" They all nodded yes. \"Okay, get your stuff. We're starting. We'll go to addresses and if ownersnare at work we'll find out where and get em there.\" \"Woo!\" Cheered Mirror man \"Party time!\" \"Toby, you stay here with Otto and Junie. We need your skills.\" SaidnMemphis \"Sure man.\" \"Donny.\" Memphis gestured to the desk \"You know what to do.\" Donny nodded, a grin of satisfaction on his face as he hit play on the tapenrecorder and Low Rider filled the airwaves. They all closed their eyes and listened, even the younger crew kept quiet. After a couple of minutes Memphis spoke \"You all still ready?\" \"Lets ride.\" Said sway throwing on her heavy black duster and grinning. They all grabbed their bags and a set of keys per pair, and set off towardsnthe door. Rachel stopped as she reached Toby, bent down and kissed himnsquare on the lips. \"You're a cute one.\" She said as she stood up. \"Woo!\" Shouted sway as she spun around to face Rachel, jogging backwardsnthrough the door grinning. \"Look out ladies, we're comin to get ya!\" \"Hell yeah!\" Laughed Rachel as she lit up a smoke and followed her, leavingnToby sitting open mouthed and breathless. *** End chapter 13 *** Authors note - Just want to apologize in advance that the next chapter mayntake a while. Boost scenes are hard to write! But don't worry, you will getnit soon enough. AN x[Chapter 15] Chapter 14. . 2.33pm . The crew pilled into two black SUV's that stood in the driveway. Brand new,ntinted windows, fake plates. Rachel, Memphis, Sway, Tumbler and Mirror manninto one, Donny, Sphinx, Kip and Freb into another. Otto watched from the door of the garage as they pulled away, and sweptnaround the corner leaving nothing but clouds of dust in their wake. Henpulled his walkie-talkie from his pocket and pushed the talk button, \"Good luck guys.\" He said \"Think fast and be careful.\" \"We will.\" Came a reply over the waves, and to everyone's amazement, it wasnSphinx. *** Mirror man eased his car up to the curb opposite a small office parkingnlot. In a space at prime view was a gleaming silver Lamborghini Diablo. Thencorner of Sways mouth pulled up a fraction of an inch and she patted herncoat to check that she had all she needed. \"See you guys later\" She said reaching for her door handle. \"Wait.\" Memphis grabbed her arm and pointed over at a figure immerging fromnthe building. The man pulled a key chain from his pocket and beeped off thenalarm to the Lamborghini. \"Ah shit!\" Cursed Mirror \"He's heading for our pick.\" \"Yeah, but he just made our lives a hell of a lot quieter!\" Tumblernmuttered \"I'll stall him.\" Said Rachel, jumping from the SUV and heading across thenstreet. She pushed the talk button on the walkie-talkie in her pocket andnput it on lock, so that they could all hear what was going on. \"Hey there.\" She beamed, \"Do you have a minute? I'm kinda lost!\" Shensashayed over to him and turned so that he stood with his back to the car. Memphis smiled and shook his head, the girl had balls. \"Sure baby!\" The guy leered at Rachel \"Where is it you want to go?\" \"Well, to be honest I don't really know! How 'bout I tell you what buildingnI'm going to and you see if you can help me.\" \"Okay cupcake. Fire away!\" Memphis turned in the car and smiled at Sway over his shoulder \"You ready?\" \"You betcha.\" She grinned. \"Okay, go. But be fast, and quiet, they're not that far away.\" Sway nodded and slid silently out of the car. She crept across the street,nand dropped down at the side of the Lamborghini. \"Okay.\" Said the office guy as Rachel finished an elaborate story aboutnballet school and non-existent theatres \"I think I can help you.\" \"Yeah right!\" Snorted tumbler \"How many ballerinas did you ever see in Docsnand leather pants!\" Memphis didn't respond. He sat staring straight ahead watching Swaynintently as she expertly jimmied her way into the car, looking up from hernwork every couple of seconds to check that Rachel was still talking. Therenwas a soft pop and in a flash she was in and behind the wheel. She took andeep breath. Italy, leather, gasoline. Her kind of heaven. She reached up under the steering column and pulled down a lone wire. Shendidn't need to check which one she had, she knew, she had done this toonmany times. She snipped it and at the same time slid a thin switch bladeninto the ignition. The car roared to life and Sway relished the powerfulnsound. Rachel heard the noise before the suit did and she quickly flung her armsnaround his neck, pulling him into a hug to distract him. \"Thank you,\" She whispered sweetly into his ear \"Thank you so much.\" \"Your welcome baby.\" He pulled away and grinned at her \"You want a ridenthere? I have a real nice sports car I could take you in.\" \"Oh yeah.\" She raised her eyebrows innocently \"Which one?\" He turned around and pointed at the empty spot where the Lamborghini hadnbeen. Sway was nowhere to be seen. His jaw dropped open and a small, pathetic squeak escaped his mouth. \"What the?\" He turned back to Rachel. \"My fucking cars been stolen!\" Rachel let out a girly huff \"Yeah, whatever!\" \"It has!\" He exclaimed, \"It was right there in that fucking spot!!\" \"Sure, sure it was cupcake.\" Rachel turned on her heel and stalked backnacross the street, to the SUV, leaving the suit standing dumbly staring atnhis parking spot. \"She pulled the lock off her walkie-talkie and hauled it from her pocket asnshe climbed in the car. \"30 seconds Sway. Not bad.\" There was no response. \"Sway?\" Memphis clicked the talk button on his own receiver. The roar of a car came floating over the airwaves. \"You okay?\" Asked Memphis. \"Lamborghini.\" Sway whispered headily. Memphis smiled and shook his head. That was all they were going to get fromnher. \"Ouch.\" Said Tumbler \"I think that guy might be having a hernia.\" Henpointed over at the Lamborghini owner who stood in the same spot, his mouthnopening and closing wildly. \"Yeah well, leachy bastard deserves all he gets!\" Rachel snarled, \"Peoplenlike that should not be able to drive cars like THAT! Right Sway?\" Still no reply. \"We've lost her until she's parked that car.\" Commented Memphis matter-of-nfactly \"Now can we get out of here before that guy notices that Rachelnisn't the only one in this car?\" \"You're the boss dude.\" Mirror started up the SUV and made a U-turn in thenroad. As the car pulled away an headed back down the street Memphis looked out ofnthe window and took a deep, slow breath. \"One down.\" He said more to himself than anyone else. *** End Chapter 14 *** Author's note - Okay, so its short! I know, but hey it's a chapter right?nI'm sorry folks, I'll try and make the next one a bit longer![Chapter 16] Chapter 15. . 2.56pm . As the remaining members of Sway's crew headed for their next boost; acrossntown Sphinx, Donny, Kip and Freb pulled up into a high school parking lot.nThere were no people around at the moment, but they all knew that in aboutn4 minutes time the concrete would be bustling with over excited high schoolnkids on their way home. The four of them had arrived at their address to find the driveway emptynand after an amount of concerned-relative acting from Donny; they hadndiscovered via the neighbors that the owner of the car would be in schoolnuntil 3.00pm. Kip slid the van into park and cut the engine. \"What the hell kind of high school kid has a Mazda MX-5 for a car?nSeriously!\" He exclaimed \"I had a beat up old piece o' shit that barelyneven moved.\" He shook his head. \"I don't know,\" Donny said passing Sphinx a tool kit, but I'm not reallynsure if I want to find out either, so can we just do this please. Sphinx?\" Sphinx nodded, dropped down out of the SUV, and stalked across the lot tonthe tiny black sports car. \"Hardly what you'd call inconstituous is he?\" Snorted Freb. \"No, an not only because the word is inconspicuous.\" Kip laughed and thencolor in Freb's cheeks upped a couple of notches. Sphinx reached the Mazda and looked around quickly. No one in sight. Henlooked down and wrinkled his nose. Pile of crap plastic car. This was not anreal automobile; it was a matchbox-car with a gas pedal. Sphinx liked hisncars big, classic and stylish. He expertly assessed the locking system and raised an eyebrow. This wasngoing to be easier than he had anticipated; dumb ass high school kid forgotnto lock up. He stepped forward and pulled the door open, cramming his huge frame behindnthe wheel of the tiny car. He pulled a screwdriver from his coat pocket andnstripped the panel from the steering column, after a brief scan he pushed anGizmo into the ignition and with a quick flick of his wrist the car caughtnand rumbled to life. He backed out of the parking space and pulled off outnof the school gates followed shortly after by the black SUV. Kip pushed the talk button on his receiver. \"10 seconds Wayland! He beat you girl.\" \"Yeah, but only because his car wasn't locked up.\" Donny cut in \"Don'tnworry Sway, that one didn't count, you're still at the top of the scorenboard!\" Sway sat down on the desk at Otto's \"Always have been, always will be.\" Shensighed matter-of-factly into her walkie-talkie \"Very sure of your self aren't you Miss Wayland.\" Memphis's voice floatednacross the airwaves from the other van. \"Only because its true my dear,\" she chuckled \"You guys don't hold shit onnme.\" \"Want a bet?\" Asked Memphis. \"Funny,\" Sway replied sarcastically \"now I'm confused as to what we've beenndoing all along!\" \"Ha ha.\" He scoffed \"Okay, how about this. I will bet you the boost of thenF40 that I can beat your time.\" \"You are kidding right!\" \"Aaaaw. Is the little girl scared?\" Memphis taunted. \"Uh Oh.\" Mirror man cut in \"You dead now dude, that girls gonna kill you!\" Rachel picked up her receiver \"Sway. You better do this girl, don't let thenside down.\" \"I don't intend to.\" She answered, \"You're on Memphis Raines, and younbetter watch your back sweetheart! You 'little girl' me and you live tonregret it!\" \"Is that a promise?\" Memphis asked suggestively. *** Sphinx pulled the Mazda up to door of Otto's garage. As soon as he hadnexited it, it was picked up by a runner and driven back off to the waitingnwarehouse, which now contained a single lone Lamborghini, courtesy of Sway. \"Liana's home.\" Otto spoke into the receiver whilst crossing out the car onnthe list. \"Easy one I hear Sphinx.\" Sphinx shrugged, a gesture that told Otto \"they all are\". Sway pulled on her jacket and tossed Sphinx a set of keys. \"You ready?\" He nodded. \"Then lets ride. Otto, boost sheet please.\" Otto handed the young woman a piece of paper with an address and a singlenfemale name printed upon it. Melissa. Sway knew it well, an Aston MartinnVanquish. She pushed the paper through a shredder; the address memorized,nand looked up at Sphinx. \"Thish one's mine Mishter Bond.\" She wiggled her eyebrows at him and they left the garage and climbed intonan old Honda accord - a dumping car. Sphinx would drop Sway off at thenAston boost and take the Honda off to the next alone, where he would thenndump the now traceless car and drive back in his boost. A simple systemnthat had worked for the crew for years. Otto watched them go, a mixed expression on his face. He was getting toonold for this and the fact that Sway was so obviously enjoying this so muchncaused conflicting emotions within him. He was happy that she was coping,nbut it was a bit too much like old times. A twinge in his chest made himngasp and cough briefly. \"Definitely too old for this.\" He muttered to himself. *** .3.07PM. Memphis crept up alongside the 1999 Mercedes Benz SL, a hungry grin on hisnface. This was the first time he had done this in along time, and as henstood there besides the gleaming master piece he couldn't help thinkingnthat it far too long in his opinion. He slipped a Slim Jim down the door panel and knelt down in front of thenfront headlamp, working quickly he removed the bulb, and stretching out sonthat he had one hand on the Slim Jim, sparked the bulb wires with a screwndriver, at the same time pulling up sharply on the Jim. A soft pop escaped from the door panel and he pulled on the handle, givingnthe alarm only the change to beep once before he had his arm under the hoodnand snipped the wires. As he pulled her out of the multi rise car tower he picked up his receiver. \"Martina on her way. How'd I do guys?\" He asked Mirror man, Tumbler andnRachel, who had been watching from a reasonable distance in the SUV. \"42 seconds.\" Tumbler replied \"Sorry man.\" Memphis heard Sway laugh softly, triumphantly. \"Don't get too cocky Wayland! There's still time!\" \"Yeah and good job there's lots of it the way you're going!\" She remarked. \"Oooh! You're gonna get it for that one girl!\" \"Now now children\" Rachel cut in. \"Calm down.\" Sway and Sphinx drove up to the Aston Martin and she hopped out of thenHonda and crept over to the beautiful English rose before her. A smallnsmile tugged at the corner of her lips as she crouched down by the door andnpulled tools from her jacket pocket. The gleaming silver car was possiblynone of the sexiest things she had ever seen in her life, and now it was nonlonger about wanting to beat Memphis, it was about getting behind thatnwheel as soon as possible. \"License to kill my dear.\" Muttered Sphinx under his breath. *** End Chapter 15 *** AUTHORS NOTE - Now here comes the fun part!

Guess who,nlol)[Chapter 17] Chapter 16. . 3.19pm . Memphis pulled up at the garage in the sleek Mercedes and hopped out to letnthe runner take her. He walked through the small wooden door and took hisnnext boost sheet from Otto. \"What'd you get man?\" asked Mirror peering over his shoulder at the paper. Memphis grinned and fed it through the shredder. \"Faith.\" \"Aw Damn! That is so unfair! I was ten seconds behind you dude. You get angoddamn Lotus Elise and I get a.\" He paused whilst he looked down andnsurveyed his own sheet. \"Isobel! Who the fuck is Isobel?\" He looked up at the blackboard, searching for his lady. \"Probably the friggin' booby prize knowing my luck.\" He muttered tonhimself. Memphis shook his head and turned to Otto, \"How we doing?\" \"Pretty good, pretty good.\" His old friend replied, nodding his head. \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah. Everything's fine down at the warehouse, and so far we got,\" Henglanced up at the board \"The Diablo from Sway, Mazda MX5 from Sphinx, yournMercedes, and a Celica courtesy of our whining little smurf over here.\" \"Hey! I aint no smurf! I just aint some big tall freak like all you guys!nIts un-natural you know.\" Memphis raised his eyebrows. \"Okay.\" \"Are we gonna go this side of the century or not then Raines?\" Mirrornasked impatiently pulling a set of keys from the rack above the desk. \"That's a change of heart. I thought you were moaning because you wantednthe Lotus.\" \"Dude, I started to like this Isobel chick.\" He walked through the doors ofnthe garage with Memphis and unlocked their dumping car. \"Since when?\" \"Since I found out her surname was TVR Tuscan!\" *** . 3.22pm . Sphinx pulled up in a dark filthy alley that ran behind a very successfulnchain-restaurant. Parked in a spot next to some over flowing trashcans, wasna contrasting sparkling silver Lexus SC 430, Tara. She was a soft top withnleather seats and all the mod cons, a beautifully crafted machine, whichndefinitely didn't belong in this dingy alley. He looked around before he got out of the dumping car, checking to makensure his exit was clear. As he made his way over to the Lexus a scratchingnnoise caught his attention and he flatted himself up against the wall,ndissolving into the shadows. He waited silently, barely breathing, untilnthe intruder, which happened to be a large gray rat, ambled in front of himnand sat down, nibbling on a piece of stale food blissfully unaware thatnanyone was around. Inhumanly fast, Sphinx raised his foot, and in onenswift, silent motion crushed the rat beneath it. Scavengers like thatndeserved to die in his opinion, and besides, it would make a nice treat fornhis cat friend. He bent down and scooped the dead rat up into his pocketnwithout even so much as a flinch. \"Now,\" he thought to himself, \"Back to my lovely lady friend.\" *** . 3.25pm. Sway drove calmly past a parked traffic cop and it dawned on her how out ofnplace she must look in Melissa. Blonde dreadlocks and leather pants werenhardly Aston normality. She sunk a little lower in her seat and picked upnher receiver. \"Hey Memphis. You there?\" \"Yeah babe. What's up?\" He replied after a beat. \"Who you got next?\"\" \"Faith.\" \"Aw Dammit! I wanted her. Sexy lady!\" She wiggled her eyebrows as shenindicated and took a right turn. \"That's what I said!\" Chipped in Mirror \"Damn lucky bastard. Anyway, youncan't talk girl, you got all the major hotties so far! I'm gonna ring andnreserve me a real goddess for my next one before you guys get 'em all!\" \"Mirror.\" Sway said. \"What?\" \"Shut up and get the hell off the line.\" She heard him mumbling to himselfnin the background through Memphis's receiver, but he didn't say anythingnelse. \"So then,\" said Memphis, a playful tone in his voice \"How'd you do withnMelissa?\" \"46 seconds.\" \"Damn girl! She could grow a coat of rust in the time it took you!\" \"She's British.\" Sneered Sway \"I go for the Italian girls. Besides, I don'tnsee you beating my thirty.\" \"I will, with Faith, trust me.\" \"Would trust you as far as I could throw you Mr Raines!\" She laughed. \"Seenyou later babe. Much later if the time you're taking is anything to go by!\"nAnd with that, she disconnected, giving no time for a come back fromnMemphis. *** .3.26pm. Sphinx cruised along in the lap of luxury in his Lexus, much better thannthe pile of crap Honda he'd just been in. He'd played his favorite,ntrademark trick; leaving the dumping car in the spot where the boost hadnbeen. Sometimes he wished he could be there to see the owner's reaction atnthe transformation of their prize belonging. The whining of motorbikes filled his ears, and before he could react, henwas surrounded by eight black Kawasaki's. One rider, fully clad innsurprisingly Sway-esque black leathers signaled for him to stop, and henpulled the Lexus over at the side of the road. A red-hot rage started tonboil up within him and he climbed out of the car forcefully, ready for anfight. That was until he noticed the eight guns, now pointed discreetly atnhim. \"Shit.\" He thought. *** .3.30pm. \"Yo Otto!\" Called Toby from the back of the garage, \"You better come listennto this dude, I think we got some action.\" Otto ambled over to the young blonde and took the large black headphones henwas offering him. Toby twiddled with some of the knobs on the makeshiftncircuit board that he had set up earlier, and Otto held one of the cans upnto his ear. Static echoed through and then a very faint voice fizzled across, \"Bravo-four-six this is Dispatch, we have just received a call from TrafficnDelta-nine-nine of a sighting of the stolen automobile turning right at thencorner of Whethers and Sixth. Are you in the vicinity?\" \"This is Bravo-four-six, we are approximately half a mile from thenlocation. What are we looking for dispatch?\" Otto glanced up at Toby, his eyes saying it all \"Please don't be one ofnours.\" \"Owner describes a 2003, Aston Martin Vanquish, silver, license platennumber zero-\" Otto dropped the headphones; he didn't need to hear anymore. \"Shit! That's Sway.\" He muttered as he picked up his receiver. \"Sway? Younthere?\" After a second of nothing her voice drifted through. \"Yeah.\" \"Get the hell out of that vanquish girl, you got a tail.\" \"What! Fuck!\" She banged her fists on the steering wheel \"Where are theynOtto?\" \"By now, probably turning right at the corner of Whethers and Sixth.\" \"Oh shit!\" Sway chuckled slightly, gearing up into sixth and squeezing thengas. \"Keep me posted Otto.\" \"Sway?\" Memphis cut in from his Accord, \"I heard that, I'm coming to picknyou up. I'm about 2 minutes from Faith, give me thirty seconds to get hernand then I'm about 2 miles from you.\" \"Thirty seconds. That's a bit adventurous isn't it?\" He ignored her banter and grabbed his tools from the backseat of the Honda.n\"Give them the run around for five minutes or so, give me chance to get tonyou. Keep me in on your position.\" And with that he disconnected. Otto listened to the deadening silence now on the line and drew a deepnbreath as the burning sensation returned to his chest. \"Hey man you ok?\" Asked Toby eyebrows raised. \"I'm fine.\" He snapped, \"Keep checking the police line.\" Toby nodded and quickly returned his attention to the dizzying array ofnbuttons and wires laid out before of him. They didn't need this right now thought Otto thought as he ran his handnover his face, and picked up his receiver, again. \"Rachel, please tell me that you guys have some good news for me.\" Rachel and Tumbler were the only two remaining in their van and once theynhad picked up the next car, they would drive the van back too, and go offnas a pair in another accord. \"Yep, we're just pulling up to Samantha now. And, damn! Is she fine?\" Shentilted her head and blew out a little breath of appreciation for the darkngreen sleek Jaguar XJ220 before her. \"Looking forward to this one.\" Tumbler grinned as he pulled the van to anstop and reached down between his feet for his kit. \"Yeah!\" Laughed Rachel, \"Sit your skinny ass down sweet pea, you aint goingnnowhere. This one's mine.\" \"What! Dream on, I drove all the way over here, therefore I get the girl!\"nTumbler exclaimed gesturing at the Jag. Rachel sat and turned her head very slowly to look at him, sending him anlevel \"yeah, right!\" stare. \"See you later boy scout.\" She finally said sliding out of the SUV andnsauntering across the road to the Jag. \"Er, Otto.\" Tumbler said warily into his receiver. \"Does this girl actuallynknow what she's doing? She's not being very discreet, you know what I'mnsaying?\" \"Just watch her.\" Sway cut in. Tumbler sat and narrowed his eyes as Rachel reached into her pocket andnpulled out her cell phone. She flipped it open and began talking rapidly,nwhilst standing in plain view in front of the drivers side door. \"What the fuck is she doing.\" Muttered Tumbler to himself. He didn't evennnotice at first that Rachel had even got the door open, and then she slidninside still talking on the phone, loudly, his jaw dropped open \"How the hell did she do that!?\" He exclaimed into his receiver. \"She's an good actress.\" Replied Sway \"She makes you believe that the ladynbelongs to her and you don't even notice that the key she is fumbling withnin the lock is actually a six inch steel wire down the door panel. No bodynnotices because she looks like she belongs there.\" \"Holy shit!\" Laughed Tumbler \"That is a damn good trick.\" \"Watch her reach down now and root in her 'handbag'.\" Sway saidndisconnecting, back to her own business. Rachel reached down with one hand, keeping her head in plain sight andnchattering loudly to the talking clock on her cell. To the general publicnshe looked like she was rummaging around in her handbag for her compact,nwhen in fact, she had a knife in the ignition and screwdriver in thensteering column. The car roared to life and smiled, closing her eyes for a second, savoringnthe power and style of the beautiful car. \"Ciao.\" She said to the clock as she snapped the cell phone shut andnslinked the car out of the parking spot. Tumblers voice came through on the receiver in her pocket \"Damn girl! Younjust stole a car from outside a shopping complex and no-one even noticed!\" \"What was my time?\" Rachel said, smiling to herself. \"32.\" \"Oooooh! So close, so close.\" *** .3.32pm. Memphis climbed out of the accord and moved over to the Beautiful YellownLotus. In his opinion, the only car manufacturer who could get away withnyellow cars. If his mind hadn't been on other things, he probably would have beennenjoying this intently. He didn't even notice that he was inside the car inn28 seconds flat. \"Memphis, where the hell are you, I can't stay close to you and keep thesenguys off my back for much longer.\" Said Sway rapidly into her receiver asnshe viciously swung the Aston around a sharp bend. \"I'm coming, where are you?\" He replied as he waved goodbye to mirror andnpulled the Lotus away. \"About a mile from the Stockholm garages. Heading North.\" \"Ok, keep going on that course. I'll probably meet you just before you hitnthem coming South.\" *** Otto listened from back at the garage as they both disconnected. What were they thinking boosting in broad daylight? He couldn't shake thenfeeling that this was going to all end badly. *** End chapter 16***[Chapter 18] Chapter 17. .3.33pm. Sphinx fought the hazy fog that enveloped his mind and with all thenstrength he could muster opened his unnaturally heavy eyelids. He wasndisorientated and uncomfortable and on top of that felt strangely motionnsick. He tried to roll over but could move. He was trapped, boxed in somewherenbut couldn't remember where. Then as he struggled to free his mind, it allncame flooding back. The bikers, the big, heavy pipe. He tried to reach upnto touch the spot on his head that he knew would now be caked in blood, butncouldn't move his arms. They seemed to be pinned down to his sides somehow. He was in a very strange and uncomfortable position, with his back at annunnatural angle, as his eyes swam into focus, he realized it was dark. \"Where the fuck am I?\" He thought his defensive anger jumping up to covernthe fear in the pit of his stomach. He took a deep breath to calm himself,nthat's when it hit him. He knew that smell anywhere. Oil, leather and finenJapanese craftsmanship. He was in the trunk of the Lexus. *** .3.35pm. Sway glanced up in her mirror hoping again that she'd lost them on thatnlast corner. Her stomach sank as she saw the blue and white now joined bynanother, swing into view. \"Shit!\" She exclaimed, banging her fists on the steering wheel again and flooringnthe Vanquish. They were a good 400 yards behind her. If she jumped out now,nshe'd get away, but then she was caught. \"Where are you Memphis?\" she thought. \"Come pick me up.\" She was nearing the south end of the garage complex and if he didn't arrivensoon, she was out of obstacles, and it was all open road from there on. Nonescape. The garages were a huge set of about 30 that ran down the left handnside of the road. Each one had two sets of doors so you could drive intonone from the road, like a normal house garage, and straight through out thenother side, onto another road which the owners used as an off road. Theynwould pull their lorries in at night through the doors facing the road andnthen pull out the next day without having to turn around. Straight into thenoff road and away. As she got closer and closer, and started to panic, she noticed somethingnsleek and yellow heading for her in the opposite direction. She slowed anlittle to allow Memphis to catch up to her before she reached the garages,nand smiled slightly to herself. He never let her down. As he got closer, his face came into focus. He signaled to her that he wasnturning off right down the back of the garages onto the off road. Shennodded and he winked at her and made the sharp right at what must have beennmore than 90mph. Sway quickly pulled over onto the left side of the road,nso that she was driving right next to the garage doors. She looked ahead for an empty bunch; she needed about 3 to be on the safenside. She saw then and dropped her speed a fraction. Her adrenalin kicked in as she reached her open set and her heart raced.nShe loved this shit! About 4 meters from the fist door of her set she tookna deep breath and swung a very sharp left through the open door and quicklynrighted her self to head out the other end. She listened to one blue andnwhite misjudge and smash into the wall, before she prepared herself andnswung a hard right out of the other door and onto the off road. Memphis was about 3 meters away from the open door and closed his eyesnbriefly as Sway swung out in front of him. Close. He slowed purposelynblocking the door she had just flown through and the remaining blue andnwhite screeched to a halt. He held up his hands and reversed slowly, fullnof over-the-top apologies and fake shock. Sway hadn't had chance to hit the second door in her row, good job she'dnpicked a bunch off three, she thought as she pulled another right into thenthird garage and headed back out of the other side onto the road. She knewnthat Memphis will have slowed them down and she had a good thirty secondsnto haul ass and get out of the car. Sway floored the Vanquish and headed up to the end of the garages atnnearing 140mph. Her heart raced, and she got that feeling she only ever gotnwhen doing this. Boosting was in her blood. She pulled up at the lastngarage and jumped out of the car before it had fully stopped. She glancednquickly over her shoulder and then scrambled over the wall that jutted outnfrom the side of the last garage. Swinging her legs over she jumped downnstraight into the path of an oncoming car. Slamming her hands down on thenbonnet, she jumped back a couple of feet and the car screeched to a halt. She grinned at Memphis through the windscreen as he sat ashen faced, hisneyes wide, gripping the steering wheel tightly. She ran around and hoppedninto the passenger seat. Memphis pulled away quickly and Sway looked overnat him, out of breath, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lip. \"Fancy seeing you here.\" She remarked. That made him laugh, and as they drove away, leaving the police to wondernwhere the hell the joy rider went, he drew a deep breath and shook hisnhead. \"Jesus Sway. Nearly got you twice babe.\" She settled down in her seat and closed her eyes, tired from her adrenalinenrush. \"You were nowhere near. Babe.\" *** .3.36pm. Finally, Sphinx felt the Lexus slow and the engine was turned off. Henwaited and listened until he heard someone move around to the trunk andnunlock it. The light was blinding in contrast to the dark he had just beennsubmerged in and he screwed his eyes up as he was hoisted out of the carnand placed on his feet. He knew his legs weren't going to hold him, and there was nothing that hencould do to help himself as an insane dizziness spun the world around. Hendropped heavily to his knees and threw up. Someone laughed from above him, but the voice sounded hollow and distant innhis head. The whole world was spinning and echoing as he got dragged backnto his feet and pulled towards a large breezeblock building. And to top it all off, he had absolutely no clue where he was. *** .3.37pm. Memphis picked up his receiver and clicked the talk button. \"Otto.\" After a second he answered \"You get her?\" \"Yeah she's here. We lost Melissa though.\" \"Never mind, we have one more we can try later. You both ok?\" Otto askednconcerned. Memphis looked over at Sway and she raised her eyebrows. \"Yes.\" He replied after a beat \"We're fine. We'll be in in about 8 minutes.nAnd listen up guys,\" He addressed everyone through his receiver \"I wantneveryone back at the garage as soon as they can.\" \"I got Rachel, Mirror and Kip here already,\" Otto said \"And tumbler shouldnbe on his way in.\" \"2 minutes.\" Tumbler cut in. \"Donny, Freb. What about you guys?\" Asked Memphis. \"I just dropped Donny off at Sarah,\" Answered Freb \"I'm driving the vannback now, we'll both be there before you guys\" \"Anyone heard from Sphinx?\" Asked Kip. \"No.\" replied Memphis \"Otto?\" \"No, but you know what he's like Memphis. He's said more today than he hasnin the whole of last month put together. He'll be here.\" \"Ok.\" Memphis nodded \"See you soon guys.\" \"Bye.\" Answered Otto and they all disconnected. Memphis set his receiver down on the dash and stole a quick glance at Sway.nShe was running her eyes along the dash. A deep look, mentally undressingnit to get at what was underneath. Then she shifted uncomfortably in her seat. \"Seriously,\" she said more to herself that to Memphis. \"Running and leathernpants aint a great combination in weather like this.\" He chuckled slightly and looked up at the hot sun. Sway suddenly reached and pulled her credit card out of her back pocket. \"Pull over.\" She mumbled to Memphis, her card between her teeth as she putnher hand on the door handle. \"What?\" \"Just do it.\" Memphis pulled over obligingly and she hoped out of the car and took thencard from her mouth. \"Back in a second.\" She said shutting the door and walking towards a store. Memphis sat, eyebrows raised, waiting for her. She never ceased to amazenhim. Just as he stared to feel slightly too self conscious sat in a stolen carnat the side of the road, she returned, shopping bag in hand, card back innher mouth as she opened the door to the car and got in. \"I can't believe you just went shopping.\" Memphis laughed as he pulled outnand drove away. She smiled and pulled a pair of khaki green utility pants out of the bagntossing it, now empty, onto the back seat. She sank down a bit in her seatnand popped the top button on her leathers. Memphis gave her another quicknsideways glance and smiled as she shrugged her eyebrows at him. She wriggled out of the leathers to reveal a pair of pink and black lacenpanties. Memphis did a double take and then looked at her questioningly. \"Sway?\" She grinned at him mischievously as she ripped the tag off the new pantsnand pulled them on. \"I did promise you leather, high heels and pink underwear.\" He laughed loudly and shook his head. She grinned and fastened the tie at the top of the combats \"I can't drivenin heels though, so you'll have to wait 'till later.\" \"I'll hold you to that.\" ***End Chapter 17 *** Authors note - Get me eh!

Hope you enjoy the next chapter, and here's where we leftnoff in 17, Memphis is in Faith, a yellow Lotus Elise, accompanied by Sway, whom he hadnto rescue from Melissa, the ever sexy Aston Vanquish, as she was beingntailed by police. Sphinx picked up the stylish Lexus SC 430, Tara, (along with a nice juicynrat for his cat friend!) only to be hijacked and taken off to an unknownnlocation in its trunk. Its just gone 3.37pm and the whole crew is now going to reassemble at thengarage for a pep talk from Memphis after Sways near miss. It's just a shamenthat none of the others realize that Sphinx won't be joining them.[Chapter 21] Chapter 18. .3.48pm. Ten minutes later Otto's eyes brightened as he heard the roar of an enginenthat could only belong to a Lotus. A couple of the crew ran out to thendrive to get a closer look at the sexy lady as Memphis and Sway walkednthrough the garage door, Memphis scanning the room quickly, a mentalnregister running through his mind. Sway dumped a shopping bag on the floornand Rachel raised her eyebrows. \"Did you change!?\" She chuckled. Sway simply flashed a small grin and sat down next to her as the othersnreturned to their seats muttering words of appreciation and awe for thenbeautifully crafted Faith. Memphis looked over at Otto. \"Still no Sphinx?\" He shook his head. \"Shit.\" Cursed Memphis \"He should be back by now.\" *** .3.50pm. Sphinx had blacked out again and awoke to find himself tied to a chair,nobviously inside the ominous looking breezeblock building. He kept his eyesnshut, wanting more time to figure out what he was up against and what thenhell he was going to do about it. He identified five separate voices, onenof these, belonging to Johnny B. \"What are you brain-dead asshole!\" He shouted at one of the other men. \"Ofnthe ten people in that crew that you could have gotten me, you went andnbrought me the one who can't fuckin' speak!\" \"We-\" One of the others tried to defend their actions. \"Shut the hell up Smithy I couldn't give a damn! Jesus! Fuckin' brain-deadnthe lot of you!\" \"We can still use him Johnny B.\" Someone else piped up. \"For barterin' andnshit.\" \"We can still use him.\" Mimicked Johnny in a whiney voice \"Yes, asshole,nbut we could have used one of the ones THAT COULD FUCKIN' SPEAK to get someninfo out of them as well! Shit! Why didn't you get his girl? I asked you tonget her!\" \"There's two girls boss.\" Muttered Smithy \"We didn't know which one shenwas.\" \"Does it fucking matter! At least they can speak! Jesus. Assholes! She thenonly one with fucking blonde dreds.\" \"Sorry Jonny.\" They all muttered in unison. \"Oh shut the hell up and just search him aiight.\" Snapped Johnny with annexasperated sigh, and Sphinx heard what sounded like him sinking down intona chair. Footsteps came towards him and someone slapped him sharply around the face. \"Oi! Big man. Wake up asshole.\" Sphinx shook his head to clear the stars now dancing behind his eyelids andnslowly raised his gaze to stare menacingly into the face of a short, stockynman who couldn't have been older than twenty. \"Ah so you's awake sleeping beauty!\" He said brightly. Some of the othersnchuckled and the short man, who by the sound of his voice was Smithy,nstepped back. \"I's goin' to search you now dude, but don't go getting' any funny ideasncoz I don't swing that way OK.\" The crew laughed again, moronically, andnJohnny's voice echoed from across the room, where Sphinx noticed he was, asnhe had suspected, sat in a battered old armchair. \"Just fucking do it will you Smithy!\" \"Aiight aiight! Chill dude.\" Smithy muttered and he reached forwards to putnhis hand in Sphinx's left pocket. He rummaged around for a moment and thennretracted sharply with a yelp, stumbling backwards into one of his crew. \"Holy Shit!\" He shouted as he flung something across the room. \"What thenfucks wrong with you!\" He yelled at Sphinx as Johnny B leapt from his chairnand came running over to see what the commotion was about. \"What?\" He barked at Smithy. \"Damn sick bastard's got dead fuckin' rats in his pockets man!\" Smithynanswered shaking his hand violently \"Damn teeth got in my hand. What ifnI've got rabies or sumthin'!?\" He pointed over at the large gray rat thatnnow rested on the floor by the door, and they all took cautious a step backnfrom Sphinx who was starting at them, deadpan. \"Eeew! You're sick dude.\" Someone retorted. \"Rabies wont make no difference to you anyhow.\" Snapped Johnny. \"Polis, getnrid of that will you.\" He barked at one of the larger men, \"And you threenget your asses over here, we need to decide what we're gonna do with him.nHe might not be able to talk, but he sure as hell aint got no problemnhearin'. Aint that right freak?\" He addressed Sphinx before he turned awaynfollowed to the back of the room by his cronies. Sphinx simply blinked atnhim, as realization flooded over him. In their haste to get rid of the rat, they hadn't checked Sphinx;'s rightnpocket, in which sat his receiver, set on mute, so they would never know itnwas there. He began to pull at the ropes binding his hands behind thenchair. All he needed to do was create enough give to get his hand to hisnpocket and he could set his plan into action. *** .3.55pm. Sway sat ridged next to Rachel, her jaw set as she watched Memphis pacingnaround the room, and listened to the others as they loudly discussed waysnof finding their missing crew member. Memphis caught her eye and paused for a second to look at her, guiltnpredominant on his features. The muscles in his jaw twitched and he turnednaway to continue his pacing. Sway let out a shaky breath and looked down atnthe floor, her hands hanging limply off her knees. This was exactly whatnthey didn't want to happen, what they didn't need. She tipped her head backnand closed her eyes, savoring the feeling of relief, when she felt a handnlightly resting on top of her own. She looked sideways at Rachel who satngazing intently at the cigarette in her other hand, before raising it tonher lips and giving Sway a fleeting glance of reassurance. *** .3.59pm. Sphinx bent his arm around a fraction of an inch further so that he couldnreach into his pocket. He groped around for a second, and just when henthought his arm was going to break from being forced into this unnaturalnangle, his fingers closed around the cold solid lump of his receiver. Beadsnof sweat appeared at his temples as he fumbled with it and eventuallynmanaged to push down the talk button and flick on the hold switch. Gently he eased his hand out of his pocket and back behind his back wherenhe flexed and relaxed it repeatedly trying to get the circulation re-npumping. Johnny's crew huddled around him in the far corner of the room,nthere backs to him, totally oblivious to the fact that Sphinx's own crewncould now hear every whisper as well as he could. *** .4.02pm. Sway still sat in the same place watching Memphis. The talking around hernhad become louder in desperation and they were starting to bicker. \"Its Johnny B man, I'm telling you.\" Said Freb shaking his head. \"Yeah!\" Snapped Kip \"I think we'd gathered that boy genius!\" \"I was only trying to help!\" He retaliated and Tumbler cut in to continuenthe argument. Sway tipped her head back again, exasperated. That's when she heard it. A small noise from somewhere next to her. She snapped her head up andnlooked down. There was noting there. She listened a little harder, andnheard it again, this time sure it was not a figment of her imagination. Itnsounded like someone clearing their throat and she realized that it wasncoming from her pocket. She quickly whipped out her receiver and held it to her ear, unable to hearnproperly for the noise that was going on around her. \"Hey guys.\" She said her voice raised \"Hey! Hey, SHUT HE HELL UP!\" Shenshouted and everyone turned to look at her. \"Get out your receivers and turn up the volume.\" She ordered, and they allndid. \"Holy shit!\" Exclaimed Mirror after a second \"That sounds like Johnny B!\" Everyone started to talk again, loudly, and Memphis tossed his receiver tonToby. \"Hook this up to your circuit, I want to hear every word they are sayingnloud and clear, and I want you to monitor it until we find out where theynare.\" \"Yessir!\" Toby threw him a quick salute and hurried off, followed by mostnof the younger crewmembers. Memphis walked through the commotion over to where Sway sat., a small grinnplaying across his features. Without breaking his stride he grabbed hernface in his hands, and pulled her lips up to his, enveloping her in anbrief, strong kiss. \"Clever lady.\" He mumbled against her lips before turning and walking backntowards Toby. *** End Chapter 18 ***[Chapter 22] Chapter 19. .4.08pm. Less than five minutes later, Toby had a connection to the receiver hookednup, and the whole room could clearly hear the mumbles and snippets ofnconversation that it picked up. Memphis wandered over to join with Sway on the same desk she had been satnon for the past 20 minutes. Rachel, none to subtly, got up to allow themnsome alone time. \"You okay?\" Sway asked as Memphis sank down next to her his eyes closed. \"Mmm. Just tired.\" \"We didn't need this did we?\" Sway grinned, placing a hand gently on hisnknee. \"Er, in a word - no! Not really.\" He laughed slightly and opened his eyesnso he could look at her. \"You're so calm. How do you always do that!?\" \"Calm! Memphis are you forgetting my little outburst? Waterworks andneverything!\" He laughed louder and bent in to kiss her briefly. She always managed tonmake him smile. \"Seriously?\" She asked. \"Yeah.\" \"I have someone here who just put it all in perspective for me. And Inguess, I don't know, they just keep me calm. As long as they are, I am.\" He raised an eyebrow at this, and followed her gaze over to where Rachelnstood, casually leaning against the wall, cigarette in hand, retreatingndeep behind her dark eyes. She flicked the ash from her Kool and laughed asnTumbler dropped a screwdriver in an attempt to impress her by spinning itnin his hand. He fumbled on the floor to pick it up and she laughed again,ntaking a long drag on her cigarette and shaking her head. Sways voice broke into Memphis's thoughts \"I used to be like that.\" He turned to look at her \"You still are.\" *** .4.10pm. Sphinx sat in the same chair, still tied down and strained to listen tonwhat Johnny and his gang were whispering about. If he couldn't hear them,nthere was no way Memphis would be able to. He needed to draw them away fromntheir corner and get them sneaking loud and clear. He suddenly had an idea,nthey were all pretty damn dim as far as he could tell and knew it wouldn'tntake much for them to fall into his trap. He slumped sideways in his chair, forcing all his weight to one sidencausing it to tip over and send him crashing to the floor. He kept his eyesnclosed. \"Shit!\" Shouted Smithy as he jumped at the noise. They all rushed forwards to Sphinx. \"Aw shit he passed out again. Fuck Smithy how hard did you hit the bastardnwith that pipe?\" Said Johnny as he helped one of the larger guys rightnSphinx, chair and all. \"I don' no dog. Pretty hard I guess. He a big dude aint it.\" \"Yeah well, I didn't want you to kill him did I! What the fuck use is andead guy to us huh? Idiot!\" Sphinx heard the unmistakable sound of a handnslapping around the side of a head. \"Sorry.\" Mumbled Smithy. \"Big Mike. Give me your phone.\" Barked Johnny \"We need to call Eddie,nupdate him.\" Sphinx had to fight his hardest to suppress a grin. This could be just whatnhe needed. *** .4.15pm. Toby batted Kip's hand away furiously as it reached in to press a button onnhis control board. \"What did I tell you man? Don't touch!\" Kip grumbled and sat down on a swivel chair, swinging himself back andnforth vigorously, desperate for something to amuse himself with. He settlednon watching Tumbler futilely trying to chat up Rachel who was having nonenof it. \"So, like er, where you from?\" He asked awkwardly, fidgeting as he stoodnridged next to her relaxed form. She slowly raised her eyes and stared at him for a beat before replying. \"Long Island.\" \"No shit.\" He nodded moronically and then quickly changed tack \"So er,nlike, er, what do you do? You know, as a job?\" The same long pause and level stare followed before she answered. \"I'm a beautician.\" \"Really?\" He asked, unable to hide the serious surprise in his eyes. She looked at him, her expression totally deadpan, before answering him andnthen drawing her smoke up to her lips. \"No.\" He looked at her, embarrassed, obviously unsure what to do with himself,nbut knowing the conversation was over. She was back in Rachel land now,nbarely even breathing, just standing slumped against the wall, hiddennbehind her eyes, surveying the room silently. Sway chuckled and nudged Memphis. \"She's such a bitch. Look at him! Poor kid.\" Memphis looked over at the bewildered looking Tumbler as he shifted hisnweight from one foot to the other. \"I think he can handle himself okay.\" They watched as he started to ramble to Rachel again, who looked as if shenhadn't even noticed he'd started talking. \"No, no, no.\" Muttered Sway to herself \"Stop talking. Please stop talking.\" Memphis laughed quietly under his breath. Sway stood up \"I can't watch this.\" She said as she picked up Rachel'sncigarettes from table. \"Hey Rach!\" She called. Rachel looked over at her as Sway held up the packet. \"Can I bum one?\" \"Sure.\" Rachel answered as Tumbler slinked away quickly, glad of thendiversion. \"Spoil sport.\" Whispered Memphis into Sways ear as she drew a smoke fromnthe packet with her teeth. She lit it and the turned to look at him slowly. \"That's very mean Memphis Raines.\" \"I'm a very mean guy.\" He said in a low voice as he leaned in and kissednher passionately. \"Do you two mind!? Ugh.\" Retorted Freb as he wandered past. Neither of them answered and without breaking from the kiss Sway flickednhim a stiff middle finger. Memphis heard Donny chuckle. \"They'll come up for air eventually.\" He saidnas he turned his back on the couple and grinned at a smiling Rachel. \"Hey guys!\" Toby suddenly yelled. \"I. I think. Yep, we got something here!nMemphis.\" Memphis and Sway pulled apart quickly and ran over. Rachel whooped and gave Toby a little wink before moving over to standnbehind him, her arms draped around his neck, Tumbler looked on enviously.nThe others came to bunch around Toby as he shushed them all, pride comingnoff him in waves as he finally became the center of attention, this timenfor the right reasons. He pulled his cans down from his ears and flicked a few switches on hisnboard. First all they got was a faint crackling, then as he turned the volume up,nand the background fader down, they could clearly hear Johnny B's voice. \"There's a lot of interference,\" Toby said as he hit a record button andnleant back in his chair, Rachel still leaning on him \"So I'd guess he's onna cell phone.\" \"Good. Nice work Toby.\" Nodded Memphis as they all stood desperately still,nworried that the slightest movement would have an effect on the signal. \"Yo!\" Said the crackly but, unmistakable voice of Johnny B \"Eddie it JohnnynB dude.\" He paused, obviously listening to the person on the other end ofnthe phone talking. Memphis felt Sway stiffen at his side at the sound ofnthe voice, her fury still raw. \"Yeah dude yeah. Safe. Mmhmm. Yep. Yep. No. We got one of them right here.nNo, its not the blonde one, this dumbass crew you sent me couldn't evennpick off one little woman!\" Memphis cleared his throat loudly, his hate for this man building withnevery word he muttered. \"No. They only went an got the only one that can't fucking speak. Yeah,nthat's him, big dude, kinda ugly. Yeah. I know dude tell me bout it!nFucking assholes. I know. Yeah. Well he can't tell you nothin'. Yeah thatnwhat I said. Blackmail dude, I like it!\" He laughed and paused a littlenwhile longer \"Nope. No. Sure dog. You come down here and we'll get ringin'nour little friend! Yeah I got his number. Yeah. Yeah. Pier 14, one of thenoutbuildings on the south side. Yeah. Easy to find-\" \"That's it!\" Memphis jumped into action. \"Right Toby, you keep an ear tonwhat he says and keep us posted via Donny's cell. We need to keep mine freenand these are no use right now.\" He pointed to his receiver. \"Er, okay,nDonny, Tumbler, Kip, Rachel you come with me, the rest of you stay here.nKeep us posted.\" He said again to Toby. \"Er, excuse me.\" Sway turned to look at Memphis her eyes wide. \"He already has you targeted Sway.\" He explained, \"I don't want you toncome.\" She raised her eyebrows and Rachel tossed her her jacket \"Tough shit.\" Shensaid as she strolled out of the door leading the others. Memphis threw up his hands and gave Otto an exasperated eye roll. Mirror man laughed \"You totally under the thumb aint you?\" Memphis shook his head \"You just don't argue with Sway.\" He replied as henbacked out of the garage, following the others, to the recently re-parkednand re-plated SUV's. *** .4.31pm. Less than 10 minutes later, the six cruised along the south side of Piernnumber 14 in the large black van, with Sway behind the wheel. \"Hey.\" Rachel pointed over Memphis's shoulder from the back seat \"Aint thatnTara over there.\" He followed her finger and sure enough, parked amongst a set of blacknbikes, and vans similar to their own, was a gleaming silver Lexus. Thenvehicles were parked on a square of tarmac that posed as a driveway for thensmall, windowless breezeblock outbuilding. There was no visible entrance sonMemphis guessed that they were now around the back, and that the door wasnon the opposite side, facing out onto the water. He turned in his seat to address the four sitting in the back of the SUV. \"You stay here. I'm gonna go check it all out. Give me two minutes thennfollow me okay?\" They all nodded and Rachel lit up yet another cigarette,nleaning back in her seat, eyebrows raised. Memphis turned to Sway \"You coming?\" He asked, but she already had one handnon the door handle. Question answered. They climbed quietly from the van and crept up the makeshift driveway tonstop against the back wall of the building. Memphis lowered his voice to a whisper. \"You go around that way,\" Henindicated right \"I'll meet you around the other side.\" She nodded and slunk away, giving Memphis one last fleeting glance over hernshoulder before turning the corner. Memphis followed suit in the other direction, moving silently along, barelynbreathing. Creeping around was second nature to him from his boosting days.nThe sound of a door slamming shut and a brief scuffling noise caught hisnattention and he flattened himself up against the cool bricks. He stoodnstill for a few seconds and the proceeded along the wall, all the whilenlistening out for further signs of activity. He stopped at the end, hisnback against the breezeblocks, ready to peer around the corner to check outnthe front side of the building. Then he froze and swore under his breath asnhe heard a voice drifted around from where he wanted to go. \"Raaaaaines!\" Johnny B sang, \"I know you're out there boy! Come on out andnsay hi, we got a right lil' party going on here!\" Memphis held his breath and his position, not wanting to do anythingnpremature. \"Say something.\" Said Johnny gruffly, this time not talking to Memphis. The next thing he heard made his breath catch in his throat. He wasn't surenif it was the shrill desperation or the wavering tone that hit him mostnwhen Sways voice answered Johnny's command. \"Memphis.\" \"Memphis.\" Mimicked Johnny laughing \"Come on, come out and say hi to yournwoman! Don't be rude.\" Memphis slowly moved out from the side of the building to stand facingnJohnny. The sight before him made him feel physically sick as he took itnall in. Johnny B stood, flanked by five or six other large men, with hisnarm wrapped around Sway's neck and a gun pointed steadily at her temple.nBeads of sweat were appearing on her pasty skin and her eyes had fadedndramatically from their usual brilliant blue to a steely gray. \"Aw here he is! Look boys its Raines, come to say hello!\" They all guffawednmoronically as Sway closed her eyes and swallowed thickly. \"Now thennRaines,\" Johnny's tone of voice dropped to a less playful tone \"What thenfuck do you think you're doing sneaking around here?\" Before Memphis could answer, he heard a noise from behind him and sawnJohnny's face contort with anger. \"What the fuck!\" He shouted. \"I could ask you the same thing.\" Came Rachel's voice from somewhere overnMemphis's shoulder, his two minutes were up and the cavalry had arrived. Memphis held up a hand to quieten her. \"RAINES!!!\" Johnny shouted again. \"Where the fuck did this lot come from?!\" \"They wont do anything-\" \"They better fucking not!\" He seethed \"I want them moved back.\" They didn't move, simply stood still staring at him levelly, Memphis'snarmy. \"NOW!\" Johnny shouted and he clicked the hammer back on the gun. Sway let out a small gasp and closed her eyes, breathing deeper and morenerratically. Memphis's knees started to feel weak and he threw his hands into the airnquickly \"Okay, okay.\" He said in a tone much calmer than he thought hencould manage, \"Take a couple of steps back guys.\" He heard a shuffling from behind him and knew that they had done as henasked. \"That's better.\" Johnny snapped, his anger subsiding slightly. \"Now answernmy question. What are you doin' here?\" \"We came to pick up a member of our crew.\" Said Tumbler gruffly. \"Oh yeah? And who's that then?\" Johnny raised his eyebrows, a worse actornthan he was a ringleader. \" 'Big dude, kinda ugly' \" Memphis mirrored Johnny's past comment as Donnynpulled a receiver out of his pocket and waved it in the air. Johnny looked shocked for a second and then his face contorted in ragenagain and he shouted over him shoulder \"YOU FUCKIN' IDIOTS! YOU DIDN'TnSEARCH HIM?\" \"Yeah dog,\" Smithy replied \"He had rats in his pocket din' 'e!\" \"Did you search BOTH pockets!?\" He yelled. \"Oh. Er, I'm, erm. I'm not sure.\" Smithy muttered in a small voice. \"Fuckin' idiots! I'm working with a bunch of fuckin' idiots!\" Rachel chuckled and reached into the pocket of her jacket. \"Hey!\" Johnny shouted whipping around to look at her \"What are you doin'?\" \"I'm havin',\" She said slowly as if talking to a small child, \"a smoke.\"nShe pulled out the packet and wiggled it at him. \"Want one?\" He growled at her and pushed the gun tighter against Sway's head making herngasp again. \"Rachel.\" Memphis warned. There was a crash and a yell from inside the building. Everyone turned andnwatched as a short stocky man emerged from the entrance behind Johnny,ndragging a smug looking Sphinx with him. \"Damn Johnny.\" He said as he shoved Sphinx, who's hands were still tiednbehind his back out of the door before him \"He wasn't fuckin' unconscious!\"nHe rubbed his nose and glared at Sphinx \"He just fuckin' head butted me!\" \"Damn it! Shut up!\" Shouted Johnny, he was starting to loose control and itnshowed in his face. Memphis became wary and he looked briefly at Sway whosengray eyes turned to him slowly and lingered. \"Hey dude!\" Said Smithy excitedly, realization flooding over his face \"Hennever was unconscious, bet he just did that to get us to talk louder!\" \"Yeah Smithy!\" Johnny spat \"I think we'd figured that out you dumb fuck!\" Smithy's smile faded and he shrank back, looking disheartened. \"What are we going to do about this little situation we have here then?\"nMemphis asked, his tone still surprisingly calm. \"Well, the way I see it Raines we are calling the shots here as we have twonof your crew!\" He grinned a malicious little grin. \"Yeah.\" Kip said \"But the way we see it, Sphinx's feet aint tied are they,nand he doesn't need his hands to knock the shit out of you morons!\" \"Kip, shut up!\" Warned Memphis. \"Yeah listen to big bro boy scout. Coz u see, problem is, if *he* triesnanything,\" He jerked his shoulder in Sphinx's direction \"I'll blow *her*nhead off.\" Memphis had to fight to keep his knees from buckling. \"Ok, I may have deal for you then.\" He said as an idea popped into hisnhead. \"I'm listenin'.\" Johnny turned his attention from Kip and the creepy, smugnsmile returned to his face. \"Well, the way I see it, you don't want many people to know about thisnright. Because that would be cheating. And I know that most of the bignplayers are in the know about our little bet.\" Johnny narrowed his eyes but didn't answer. \"Would make you look very untrustworthy.\" Memphis paused \"So if you handnthem over now, it wont be mentioned.\" \"Is that it?! I should pull this trigger right now for making me listen tonthat shit!\" \"I'm not done.\" Memphis said quickly \"I have another proposition for you.nNow I know that for you, one of the added bonuses to this, is that you'rengonna make some money off the sales of the boosted cars.\" \"Mmm,\" Johnny said \"So what?\" \"Well, I'll make a trade. Sphinx and Sway for all our cars at the end. Winnor lose.\" Johnny got a gleam in his eyes as he considered this greedily. \"Well Raines. Seems you've come up to scratch there.\" He signaled at hisnmen and they shoved Sphinx forwards towards Memphis and the others. They stood and waited for him to release Sway. \"But how,\" Johnny looked at Memphis his eyes steely \"do I know that younwont go back on your word.\" \"I wont.\" Said Memphis beginning to panic, but not showing it. \"Hmm, maybe I should keep this one just to be sure.\" He bent his head andnkissed Sway on the cheek. Fury covered Memphis's fear and he had to do everything he could to stopnhimself from charging forwards and pouncing on Johnny. \"Then again.\" Johnny smiled sickeningly \"I could just shoot her.\" Sways eyes flew wide and Memphis nearly fell to the floor. The world begannto turn in slow motion as he watched in horror as Johnny's finger squeezednthe trigger of the gun. Sway stood and waited for the flashing pain, waited for it all to go black,nshe shut her eyes tight and waited for death. There was a click and thennshe heard a loud shrill laugh from behind her and was amazed to realizenthat she could open her eyes. \"Three of the six chambers in this gun are empty,\" Johnny grinned atnMemphis who had turned an even paler shade than Sway. \"This girl's onenlucky bitch.\" He laughed again and shoved her forwards. Him and his crewnturned chuckling and walked back inside the building. Sway stared at Memphis for a beat and then crumpled to the floor. He rushednforwards and dropped to his knees in front of her. A noise from behind himntold him that the others were leaving, allowing them some privacy. Sway stayed still for at least five minutes, her head facedown on Memphis'snknees whilst she concentrated hard on her breathing and he crouched overnher body. When she finally sat up again Memphis was relived to see thatnsome on the color had returned to her cheeks and eyes. \"You okay?\" He asked quietly. She nodded \"I think-\" \"What?\" He mumbled kissing her cheek. \"I think,\" she exhaled slowly \"I need a cigarette.\" He laughed and sighed deeply as he pulled her to her feet. She smiled andnhe felt the weight in his stomach lift instantly. \"Lets go.\" Memphis said, glaring over his shoulder at the door to thenbuilding, fury boiling inside him. He was going to make Johnny pay fornthis. His thoughts were interrupted when Sway grabbed his face in her hands andnpulled it down roughly to her own to kiss him hungrily. He pulled away, breathing heavily. \"What was that for?\" \"Just checking I was really still alive.\" She grinned wickedly. He flung an arm around her shoulder and walked her back around thenbuilding. \"Are you really going to give him all the cars?\" Sway asked as theynapproached their SUV. \"Yeah,\" He looked at her \"Well we don't want 'em, and you never know,n*someone* might even send an anonymous tip-off to the cops after we'rendone. You know, Johnny could get into some serious trouble with all thosenstolen ladies on his hands!\" Sway laughed loudly and climbed into the passenger seat of the van. \"What's so funny?\" Rachel asked as Memphis started the engine. \"Oh nothing.\" Sway looked over at him and grinned before turning in hernseat to face her friend. \"Now, gimme a damn cigarette.\" ***End chapter 19***[Chapter 23] A/N - Incase anyone is wondering, the third sin of the seven deadly is -nWRATH. Chapter 20. .4.56pm. Otto heaved a huge sigh of relief as he watched the whole crew walk backnthrough the garage doors a while later. Sphinx, he noticed, looked a littlenworse for wear but at least they were all here. \"Oh thank god!\" He stood to meet Memphis \"It all go ok? Any problems?\" Memphis glanced quickly across at Sway who shook her head slightly and gavenhim a resolute look. \"No.\" He answered turning back to his old friend \"No problems.\" Tumbler laughed as he pushed through them towards the back of the garagen\"Yeah, if you call being held up at gun point nothing!\" Sway rolled her eyes, exasperated, and glared at Tumbler. \"Nice one moron.\" Kip retorted slapping him up the side of the head. Otto stared at Memphis imploringly \"Memphis.\" He raised his eyebrows. \"Ok so maybe there was a slight problem, but we sorted it.\" \"How?\" Otto demanded. He did not look happy. \"I just told the stupid son-of-a-bitch that he could have all our boostsnwhen this is over.\" The older man suddenly looked much calmer. \"Oh good, that solves onenproblem later on I guess.\" Memphis nodded. \"I can't believe that arrogant little asshole,\" Otto threw his hands intonthe air \"First he kidnaps one of our crew and then holds him up for ransomna gun point! Unbelievable!\" \"Well actually,\" Memphis pushed his hands into his pockets and gave Swaynanother glance \"It wasn't Sphinx.\" \"What? Who was it then?\" Otto looked around at them all puzzled. \"You!?\" He asked Memphis his eyes wide. \"No.\" He looked over at Sway again, Otto following his gaze, and she raisednan eyebrow and gave a feeble smile. Otto stared at her for a second and then sunk down onto a desk \"Jesus Marynand Joseph! Sway!?\" \"Mmmm.\" She replied. Otto clutched at his chest again and drew deep, shaky breaths as he staredndown at the floor. Memphis rushed forwards \"Otto?\" He asked urgently \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine I'm fine!\" He waved him away and looked up at Sway again \"Aren*you* okay?\" \"I'm fine.\" She reassured him \"No harm done.\" \"Yeah just about!\" Tumbler snorted \"'Cept when he pulled the trigger onnher!\" \"Tumbler!\" Memphis glared. \"What!?\" Otto shouted. \"Its okay, the gun was empty.\" Sway said hurriedly \"He was bluffing.\" \"No three of the chambers were empty not-\" \"Tumbler will you shut the hell up!\" Rachel shouted over at him. \"What?\" He looked around bewildered \"What? I'm just telling it like it is.\" Otto shook his head and was relived to see Sway chuckling under her breath. \"This isn't funny Wayland.\" Otto scolded waggling a finger at her. She tried unsuccessfully to arrange her face in a serious expression andnOtto grinned. \"No it fuckin' wasn't,\" Memphis said \"And I'm gonna get some revenge fornthis.\" \"Memphis-\" Otto started. \"It's okay, I'm not planning anything stupid, im just waiting until he'sngot all those ladies on his turf then I might give our old friendnCastleback a call.\" \"Who?\" Rachel asked. \"A cop.\" Kip replied. \"And speaking of law enforcement,\" Donny pointed up at the clock on thenwall \"I think we're gonna have a whole lot of cars reported stolen rightnabout now. Don't you think we should take a break till the heat dies down?\" \"What are you crazy?\" Said Mirror man, \"the whole point of a bet is ton*not* loose you know?\" \"He's right.\" Memphis nodded and Mirror man puffed out his chest lookingnsatisfied. \"Not you.\" Memphis said \"Donny. He's right. We should take break. *They've*nspent the last two hours doing nothing. We're already well ahead of themnand to be honest I doubt there even in this to win anyway. All they wantednwas to make a deal, get us to boost the cars for them so they can sellnthem.\" Realization suddenly spread over the faces of the younger crew members. \"So where do we go from here?\" Otto ran a hand over his tired face andnstood up. \"I say we take 2 hours out. Go home, get some sleep, something to eat. Thennwe can regroup later and start again.\" He paused and looked around \"Okay?\" \"Sure.\" They all agreed. Memphis turned to Sphinx \"I think you should stay out of this now. You neednto get some rest and maybe see a doctor. There's no need for you to comenback. I have someone else I can use.\" Sphinx gave him a unyielding look that told Memphis he would definitely benback in two hours time. *** .5.15pm. The tired crew trudged from the garage after Memphis was done talking, andnsoon only Sway and himself remained behind. \"You go Sway.\" He tossed her her keys. \"I want to be here incase the lawndoes show up. Make it seem like a normal day.\" \"Well in that case you would have someone else here with you.\" She put thencorvette keys down again. He stared at her for a second, contemplating whether he had the energy fornan argument and then shook his head and sat down. \"Whatever.\" Sway watched as he sunk down into a chair and closed his eyes, his headnback. He looked so much older. His face was lined, he had nearly 30 hoursnworth of bags under his eyes and was way past a 5 o clock shadow. Ten years ago, he would have looked great by now. The adrenaline andnpassion would have made his eyes shine. He'd be bouncy and full of life,nquickly stealing a kiss from Sway every time he passed her. He'd alsonprobably be stupid enough to keep boosting right now, eager to push thenboundaries as far as they would go. But now, now he just looked exhausted. He didn't want to be here, as muchnas he loved the actual boosting, he hated everything that it entailed.nCops, enemies, having people you love held up at gunpoint. Sway felt a painnin her chest as she stood there watching him, his strong, stern, resolvenremoved now that he was alone with her. She saw him for what he was rightnnow, a tired, pissed-off, scared, man who would give anything to be atnhome, watching TV on the couch with Sway, fighting over who was going tondefrost their dinner. \"Dammit,\" she though \"That's where he's going.\" But before she could reachnover to grab his jacket there was a sharp rap on the garage door andnMemphis's head snapped up, his eyes open. \"Raines? You in there boy? I need a word.\" \"Shit.\" Memphis cursed under his breath as he heaved himself to his feet tonanswer the door to Detective Castleback. *** \"No wait!\" Sway whispered as he started forwards. \"What?\" She closed the gap between them quickly and began to undo the buttons ofnhis black shirt. \"Hardly the time or place Sway! What are you doing?\" \"You want to get rid of him fast right?\" She asked re-buttoning the shirtnagain; purposely missing a few holes so that it sat lopsided. He smiled at her, as he realized what she was up to. \"Good thinking.\" He reached up and tousled his hair as she un-tucked herntank top, unfastened the top button of the combats, and kicked of hernshoes. \"Raines! You there?\" Castleback shouted again. \"Yeah just a sec\" He called back as he hurriedly took off his belt andnbegan to walk towards the door, rubbing a hand over his lips as he went,ntrying to make them as red as possible. Sway sat down on a desk, messing her always unruly hair some more, andntrying to look culpable. Not hard really. Memphis took a deep breath and opened the door to Detective Castleback. \"Hey. How you doin'?\" He asked shaking his hand and stepping aside andnletting him past into the garage. \"I'm doin' fine thanks.\" The Detective said looking around the room. Sway watched with amusement as he took in their ruffled appearance's andnhis expression change dramatically to one of slight embarrassment. \"Er, sorry to, er - catch you at a bad time. But this wont take a second.\" Sway looked coyly at the floor a mischievous grin spreading over her face,nwhilst Memphis cleared his throat loudly. \"What can we do for you?\" He asked acting as if he'd just noticed that hisnshirt was buttoned all wrong and folding his arms across his chest hastily. \"Well, we've had a record number of cars reported stolen today and I-\" \"I'm offended!\" Memphis cut in looking hurt \"You think we actually hadnsomething to do with this!?\" \"I have to check every avenue Raines. You know that.\" \"You really think I'd be *that* stupid. I have a great life now you knownthat. I wouldn't do anything to mess that up.\" Swat felt her chest contract suddenly at his words. \"I know, I know that. But you see, we got an odd description from a cop innpursuit of a stolen vehicle around 3.30 today.\" He looked over at Swayn\"Said the guy driving it had a *lot* of blonde hair.\" \"What was he boosting?\" Sway asked, malice in her eyes. \"My hunch is that maybe it wasn't a he.\" Castleback said eyebrows raised. \"Is that right.\" \"Mmmm.\" He turned away from Sway and looked back at Memphis. \"You had muchnbusiness in here today?\" \"Not much, pretty slow.\" \"How bout round 3.30pm.\" \"I'm not sure. Sway?\" She walked up behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist staring atnCastleback levelly, enjoying the fact that she was making him uncomfortablenagain. \"We had that girl come in with that sexy old Porsche. That must have beenn'bout three, maybe four.\" \"Yeah that's right!\" Memphis smiled \"You remember her name?\" \"Erm.\" Sway left him and walked over to the main desk \"We have her invoicensomewhere.\" She picked up the pre-prepared alibi that lay on the desk.n\"Rachel. Her name was Rachel Barnes. Wanted a wheel balance and new wipernblades.\" She handed the slip of paper to Castleback. \"Her number and address are onnthere if you want to go check her out. And oh,\" She feigned astonishmentn\"So's the time of her visit!\" Castleback studied the invoice intently and then looked up at the couplenand sighed. \"Okay. I'll go follow this up then.\" \"You do that.\" Said sway maliciously. \"Goodbye Detective Castleback.\" Memphis smiled. The Detective looked at them for a second, trying to read them closer, andnthen as Sway's hand began to snaked its way around Memphis waist again andnup under his shirt he started to back towards the door. \"Just, stay out of trouble Raines.\" He warned \"I don't want to find you'vendone something stupid.\" \"You wont.\" \"Good. And er, sorry to have - interrupted.\" And with that he left. Memphis let out a huge sigh of relief and sagged backwards against Sway. \"Come on.\" She said giving his a squeeze and then pulling on her shoes andnpocketing her keys. \"Lets go home. We can do this for real.\" She addednwiggling her eyebrows at him, and he followed her out of the door laughing. *** .5.30pm. Rachel let herself into her apartment and flopped down heavily on thencouch, her head back, eyes closed. She was *tired*. She hadn't felt tirednin years. But then again, she hadn't boosted in years. She had to admit itnwas around the time that she'd quit that her insomnia had kicked in. \"I need to get into some extreme sports.\" She said to herself as she rubbedna hand over her face. Adrenaline was what she needed. A hit of adrenaline knocked her out andnmade her actually *need* sleep. She liked the feeling, but didn't quitenfeel ready to risk it for a stint in a cell. \"Stunt driving.\" She mumbled as she drifted off into a deep slumber, hernday finally washing over her. *** .5.33pm. Sphinx opened his bathroom cabinet and pulled out a bottle of antisepticnand some suture strips. He looked in the mirror at the cut on his head andngritted his teeth as he held up a stinging pad of antiseptic to it. It didn't look so bad. Just a small cut, and he didn't feel dizzy anymore.nSuperficial, he'd had much worse. He did a little first aid, placing some of the suture strips over thenwound, and then admired his handy work. Not bad, but that's punk ass kidnwasn't going to get away with this so easy. Memphis's revenge would seemnmild compared to what he had planned. *** .5.35pm. \"You have nothing in this damn fridge man!\" Called Tumbler \"Half a jar ofnmayo, and what could have been cheese, a LONG time ago.\" He walked from the grubby little kitchen of Kip's rundown apartment, intonthe living room, where his friend sat on the beat up old sofa channelnsurfing. \"Hell man how do you live?\" Tumbler asked dropping down next to him. Kip gestured to the stack of empty pizza boxes on the floor by the couch. \"Take out.\" Tumbler laughed, \"Don't you ever go to your mom's. Or Memphis's! Sway'dnfeed you if you asked right?\" \"Yeah sure,\" Kip looked at his friend sarcastically \"Like she can cook.nThey live off frozen meals and Junie's casseroles. And yes, I go to my momsnon a Sunday.\" \"Jeeze.\" Tumbler picked up the phone and ordered them a large pizza andnsome fries from the takeout place they always used. \"This is really no way to live man.\" Tumbler commented as he hung up.n\"You're gonna get sick or some shit dude.\" \"Not all of us have the luxury of payoff's from daddy okay man? I'm quitenhappy here.\" \"It's a dump Kip.\" \"I know.\" \"Couldn't you move in with Memphis?\" \"No! I refuse to admit defeat to him ok? I can make my own way.\" \"Obviously!\" Tumbler gestured around as the electricity flickered. \"Itncould have some advantages you know.\" He grinned. \"Like what?\" \"Like you might get a glimpse of Sway half dressed!\" He chuckled lewdly \"Oh Jesus Tumbler! You're sick you know that?\" \"Me! Seriously dude there's something wrong with *you*. You have that girlndraped all over you and it doesn't seem to bother you.\" \"Tumbler. She's my brother's girlfriend, I value my life okay? BesidesnSway's - Sway. You know?\" \"Exactly! She's hot.\" Tumbler said exasperated. \"Can we not talk about her like this please. Pass me a soda.\" \"Okay okay fine.\" He handed Kip a coke. \"What about Rachel? Can we talknabout her like that?\" Kip grinned \"Definitely!\" *** .5.40pm. Otto sat at his kitchen table, staring down into a mug of steaming coffee.nHe heard Junie enter behind him and sit down in a chair opposite. \"You okay hun?\" She asked concerned \"You don't look so good.\" He lifted his head and smiled at her \"I'm fine sweetness, I'm fine.\" They sat in silence for a while, Otto sipping his drink, and then Junienspoke quietly. \"You're worried aren't you? You don't think they're not gonna do it.\" Otto sighed \"Its not that I don't think they can win this, to be honest I'mnpretty sure we already have.\" He shook his head and looked back down intonthe dregs of his coffee \"I just don't trust Johnny. He's not in this tonwin, and he's crazy with a capital C.\" \"You think he'll change the rules?\" \"He can't afford to do anything that would devalue him to the big players,nbut we still know he's a loose cannon. He tried to shoot Sway thisnafternoon.\" \"What?\" Junie's eyes got wide and she looked imploringly at her husband \"Isnshe okay?\" \"She's fine, she's fine. You know what she's like. That girl has more livesnthan a cat!\" Junie smiled \"But you're still worried?\" Otto smiled back, his wife always knew. She knew exactly how he was feelingnand what he was thinking. He nodded. \"Castleback's snooping around some nowntoo. Memphis just rang me. Lots of the boosts have been reported.\" Junie reached across the table and cupped one of his hands in hers \"They'rensensible kids hun. They know what they're doing, you taught them well.\" \"I know they can boost well, damn Memphis is the best damn car thief I'venever seen! I'm just worried that he's gonna do something stupid. He neverntruly had what he does now.\" \"Sway?\" Otto nodded *** .5.45pm. Sway unlocked the door to the apartment and walked inside dropping her keysnon the mail stand and her coat on the back of the chair. It seemed likenyears since they'd last been here. Memphis looked at Sways jacket hanging defiantly over the back of its usualnchair and shook his head, he didn't care, the fact that she was actuallynstill here to do that was all that mattered. For the hundredth time since it had happened, he unwillingly replayed thenhorrifying moment in his mind. Johnny's finger tightening on the trigger,nthe look on Sway's face. A shudder ran through him. He needed to get rid ofnthat image. Memphis watched Sway as she began to walk from the door and annincontrollable need ran through his body. He grabbed her shoulders and spunnher around to face him. Then he backed her against the wall, and makingncertain that there were no spaces between them, he kissed her.nPassionately, urgently. Sway stood ridged at first, surprised, but then she relaxed and sank intonthe kiss. After all this time, Memphis still drove her crazy. She tanglednher fingers in his hair as he placed his hands lightly on her hips. A lownmoan escaped his lips and she jumped up, wrapping her legs around his waistnand he carried her into the bedroom. Dropping her lightly onto the bed andncrawling over her, he looked deeply into her eyes, currently flecked withndesire. \"Where did this come from?\" She asked breathlessly. \"I just need to make sure I'm not dreaming.\" He mumbled as he pulled herntank top up over her head. She sighed and her eyes softened. \"You're not Memphis,\" She traced a fingerngently along his jaw bone \"I'm fine, I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.\" \"Promise?\" He asked kissing her lightly as he began to undo her pants. \"Promise.\" She breathed. The combats discarded he looked down at her lace underwear and grinned.n\"I'm still waiting for the heels.\" Her breath caught in her throat as he hooked a finger in the waistband ofnthe panties. \"Maybe I'll have to borrow the stilettos Rachel used for the Porschenscout.\" She said. \"How 'bout the whole outfit?\" He grinned mischievously. She raised her eyebrows at him \"You 'aint getting me in a skirt MemphisnRaines.\" His voice pitched low and his eyes darkened \"You sure?\" \"Yes.\" She said defiantly. He planted a trail of kisses down her chest to her navel and traced angentle finger over the tattoo on her hip. \"Sure, you're sure?\" He asked again. \"Mmnh.\" She answered as she closed her eyes dreamily. A couple of seconds later it all became too much for her and she flippednhim over onto his back and kissed him passionately. He chuckled against her lips and she began to undo the buttons of his shirtnfor the second time in half an hour. \"How does he do that?\" She thought to herself \"How does he still drive menso crazy?\" *** .5.53pm. Rachel was dragged from her welcomed slumber by an offence banging on herndoor. She growled and opened one sleepy eye. Then it dawned on her, thenalibi, the Detective. \"Ah shit.\" She mumbled to herself pushing up off the couch. She grabbed an old, gray Lakers sweatshirt from her bedroom and pulled itndown over her slightly oil stained t-shirt. The knocking got louder \"Just a second!\" She called, stalking over thendoor, throwing back the lock and pulling it open. The guy standing before her was tall and dark. He wore slacks, a graynwoolen sweater, and had \"cop\" written all over his face. \"Rachel Barnes?\" He asked by way of greeting. \"Yes.\" She replied sharply willing herself not to lose her cool. \"And younwould be?\" \"Detective Castleback ma'am,\" He held out a hand for her to shake andnflashed her his badge \"You mind if I asked you a couple of questions?\" \"What about?\" She asked, trying to look confused. \"There have been some auto theft's reported and I would like to talk to younabout a garage you may or may not have visited today.\" \"Yeah got my car fixed today. Ask away.\" She made no move to let him insidenthe apartment however, still standing in the doorway. \"Could you tell me the name of the garage you visited, and the time younwere there?\" \"Sure, I took my car to a place I never used before. My brother recommendednit to me. Called \"Otto's Autos\", down on long beach. I was there boutn3.15pm I guess. Why? What's happened?\" \"That's what I'm here to establish.\" He smiled politely. \"Could you tell me what they did to your car?' \"My wipers were playin' up so they fixed em, and they did something to myntires too. Its an old car, needs stuff doin' all the time.\" \"And this is the first time you visited this particular garage?\" \"Yessir.\" \"Could you describe anyone there for me? Anyone you talked to? The personnwho carried out the work?\" \"Sure, erm, there was this old guy there, he was the Otto of \"Otto's Autos\"nI think.\" She counted them off on her fingers looking up at the ceilingn\"Some other guy, tall, mid thirties he did the work on the car. And therenwas a woman there too.\" \"A woman? Could you describe her for me? Was she older, red hair?\" \"No, no.\" Rachel shook her head vehemently \"This was a young woman. Bout mynage I guess. Weird lookin', had lots of blonde dreadlocks, covered inngrease.\" She turned up her nose as if this offended her. The Detective's face seemed to fall a little and Rachel had to try hernhardest to stifle a grin. \"Did you catch her name?\" \"Er, no. They did keep calling something to her. But I'm not sure if it wasnher name. Kinda weird sounding.\" \"Right. Okay.\" He smiled at her again and backed away from the door.n\"Thanks for your help miss Barnes.\" \"Pleasure.\" She nodded. Rachel was just about to close the door when he called over from thenstairs. \"Oh. One last thing. What kind of car do you have?\" \"A Porsche 911. A red one.\" He grinned and winked at her \"Nice.\" \"Its okay.\" She shrugged \"Heap of shit keeps breaking down on me.\" He waved goodbye and she shut her door and leant back against it. \"I'm sorry Maria.\" She whispered, \"I swear to god I didn't mean it.\" *** Sway looked down into Memphis's eyes, breathing heavily. The front wisps ofnher hair sticking to her clammy forehead. She let out a soft moan as she lent in to kiss him and then rolled over sonthat she lay with her head on his chest, his arms encircling her barenwaist, hands splayed out on her stomach. \"Mmmmmm.\" She mumbled, a contented smile spreading across her relaxednfeatures. As he planted gentle kisses in her hair. \"That was.\" He breathed, seemingly at a loss to find a word to describenexactly how it was. \"Definitely.\" Her grin got wider and she rolled back on top of him andnshrugged her eyebrows at him. \"Maybe.\" She paused to kiss him briefly \"Inshould.\" Another soft kiss \"Get held up. At gunpoint. More often.\" He frowned \"No thanks. But maybe the shoes would do it.\" He grinned and shengiggled and kissed him again before curling up on his chest. They lay like that for a long time. Sway had never felt as safe, asncontented as she did right then. Memphis's arms wrapped around her,nlistening to his heart beating in his chest. Slowly his breathing steadied and became much more rhythmic and Sway knewnhe'd fallen asleep. She was glad. As much as she didn't want this time innher haven to end, she wanted him to rest. He needed it. Quietly, carefully, she slid from his arms and climbed from the bed. Shenpulled on a big black t-shirt that advertised a beer brand, snagged somenclothes from the wardrobe and crept into the bathroom to take a shower. As the hot water sluiced over her body and through her unruly hair, shenlent against the wall and closed her eyes. Her feeling of euphoria wasnbeginning to fade, replaced by anger as she remembered the desperation innMemphis's eyes, his voice, his touch. Johnny had done that. He was thencause of all of this, her bike, the bet, Memphis. She was going to make sure he paid for it all in the end. The police were going to be the last of his worries when she'd finishednwith him. ***End chapter 20***[Chapter 24] Chapter 23 is coming soon ...

Kip climbed into his beat up old Humvee and pulled out of the apartment lotnquickly. The truth was, he didn't need to see his brother as much as henjust needed to get away from Tumbler. As much as he loved his best friend, today he needed something else.nTumbler always glorified everything that was going on, making it seem morenlight-hearted than it actually was. He coated everything in a sickly sweetnlayer of pride and tough man front, pretending that the day didn't bothernhim, laughing it all off. It was his way of dealing with things, but itneventually started to grate on Kip. What he needed right now was to face up to his problems, not blatantlynignore them. Right now he needed someone he could feel close to without anynunderlying uneasiness. He needed to be able to feel he could be himself. Henneeded Sway. *** .6.04pm. The cold air of the bathroom was an unwelcome shock after the steamy havennthat Sway had created in the shower cubicle. She shivered and dressednquickly in clean underwear and a fresh pair of leather pants. Wrapping hernsopping dreadlocks up into a towel she padded quietly out of the bathroomnand back across the adjacent bedroom where Memphis still slept soundly. Shenpaused briefly and stole a glance at him, before heading out into thenliving room. She was not surprised to find Kip slouched on the couch. \"Hey.\" She greeted him. Kip looked up from where he sat as Sway wandered past him into the kitchen,ntowel drying her hair. \"Hey.\" He returned, totally oblivious to the fact that she was half naked. Sexuality had never really been an issue between the pair. Sure, when he'dnfirst met her, Kip had found Sway irresistible. They all had. She had beennthe epitome of womanhood to them, the biggest boy racers sex symbol. All,ndark hair, oil, tattoos and piercing blue eyes. It was why Memphis had gonenso crazy over her, she was an equal, untouchable. Kip had thought so to atnthe time, but romantic thoughts never even entered his head nowadays, theynseemed incestuous somehow. \"You hungry?\" Sway yelled form the kitchen. \"No.\" He replied. Sway's head appeared around the kitchen door, a frown on her face \"You'renalways hungry.\" He laughed \"I just ate a whole pizza.\" Sway gave a little shrug and ducked back into the other room. She returnedna few seconds later, laden with Chinese food cartons, a bread roll clenchednbetween her teeth. Kip chuckled as she sat down, transferring her cold,nleft-over's feast, onto the coffee table. \"What?\" She asked settling back next to him. \"Healthy Sway, real healthy.\" \"You just ate a whole pizza!\" \"Yeah, but at least mine was fresh! How long has that shit been in yournfridge?\" \"What are you? Department of health!? If it smells bad I don't eat it.nThat's worked fine for me for the past 28 years!\" He laughed again and she flicked a cold noodle at him and put a finger tonher lips. \"Memphis is asleep.\" He stifled his laugher and picked the piece of food off his shirt. \"How's he doin'?\" He asked, not looking up. Sway sighed \"Hard to tell. You know Memphis.\" Kip nodded rolling his eyes. They paused for a second, whilst Sway ate some food, comfortable in eachnother's silence. \"What's up Kip?\" Sway quizzed as she lent forward to inspect the other foodncartons she'd brought. He smiled wearily at her, grateful for her directness. She settled back sonthat she sat sideways on the couch, her back against Kips solid shoulder.nAnd she listened. As she always did. Letting Kip talk whilst she ate, nevernonce voicing her own fears. She was a pillar of strength in his world andntook it upon herself to remain that way, at all costs. *** .6.15pm. Rachel shaded her eyes from the dipping afternoon sun as she reached up andnbasketed another perfect lay-up shot. A bead of sweat trickled down thenside of her face as she ran to retrieve the ball. A scuffled noise made herninstantly aware of someone behind her and she turned quickly. She wasnsurprised to see Sphinx standing at the entrance to the small basketballncourt. Curiosity flashed through her eyes and then was quickly gone. NothingnSphinx did surprised any of them, not even that he knew where she lived. She grinned at him and bounced the ball playfully at her feet. \"You wannanplay some B ball lurch?\" The corner of his mouth cracked up a fraction of an inch and he shruggednhis eyebrows. \"What's the matter?\" She skilfully flicked the ball between her legs andnthen back around to the front whilst Sphinx slowly approached her, \"Younscared? Hmmm?\" She cocked her head and pouted. Quick as a flash Sphinx stretched forwards and snatched the ball fromnRachel's grasp, catching her off guard and sending a flash of shock throughnher whisky eyes. He began to bounce the ball at his own feet and his stern face showed thensmallest hint of playfulness. Rachel threw Sphinx a malicious smile and cocked a finger at him in a come-nto-me gesture, \"Bring it on big boy.\" *** .6.28pm. Memphis stood at the doorway to the living room smiling at the sight beforenhim. Sway lay across the couch, her head resting on Kips knees. She wasnlaughing hard, so hard that tears glistened behind her eyes. Kip had a hugendollop of slimy noodles on the end of his nose and was tryingnunsuccessfully to scowl at the woman that had put it there. A mischievousngleam entered his features and he raised the food carton that he wasnholding high above Sways head. She abruptly stopped laughing and her eyesnopened wide with panic. \"Don't even think about it.\" Memphis warned. They both turned, shocked to see him there, looking like a couple of kidsncaught in the cookie jar. Memphis laughed despite of himself and Sway grinned up at Kip. \"Busted!\" She snickered as he lowered his arm sulkily and wiped the foodnoff his nose. In two long strides Memphis stood before the couch and scooped a stillngiggling Sway up into his arms. She shrieked in shock and flung her arms around his neck. He bent in close,nso his lips were millimetres from hers. \"Were you being a bad girl too miss Wayland?\" \"Hell yeah.\" She murmured, the corners of her mouth twitching up a fractionnof an inch before he kissed her, feverently. He was freshly shaved and dressed in clean black jeans and T-shirt. Swaynhadn't even noticed he'd woken up, let alone shaved and changed. Everythingnmoulded to his body perfectly and he smelled edible. If she hadn't just hadnthe mother of all orgasms she'd have had his clothes off before theynreached the bedroom door. \"Jeeze.\" Tumbler whispered as he turned away from the couple's steamynembrace. They pulled apart at his muttering and Memphis set Sway back down on thenfloor. \"Did we wake you?\" She asked brushing the hair from her eyes. \"Yeah, but I needed to be up anyway. I have a couple of things that I havento do.\" \"Okay.\" Sway nodded. She didn't ask what, it was an unwritten rule in theirncircle. Ask me no questions and I shall tell you no lies.\" *** .6.47pm. Tumbler pulled his truck up to the doors of the garage. \"Back again.\" Henthought wistfully. He was going to go out and get *very* drunk when thisnwas all over. Glancing around he noticed that the only car missing was Memphis's. Tumblernhad never been very good with names, but he *always* remember cars. Hencould tell you exactly what car a person he'd met once, for five minutes,ndrove. It was his talent, his memory for cars, and came in very useful. Everyone else was there. There was Rachel's sexy Porsche 911 glistening innthe twilight, Kips hulking Humvee, Sway 'vette, Donny's old Jag. Everythingndown to Junie's little yellow bug. Everything except for Eleanor. It felt odd, unbalanced somehow, to have that particular car missing and itnmade Tumbler feel very uneasy and leaderless. For a brief moment henconsidered turning around and going back, but then it was gone and henreached for the door handle shaking his head. Maybe it was that pizza he'dneaten. He ambled into the garage to find everyone in familiar situations. Itnsoothed him. Not that he knew what he'd expected, he just felt better nownthat he could see everyone acting so normally. Donny and Mirror were bickering good-naturedly whilst Toby sat backnwatching, idly chewing on his thumbnail. Sphinx stood in a dark corner, anband-aid on his head, doing what he did best. Nothing. Tumbler oftennwondered if the huge man might be a reptile. He just seemed to shut down.nHe didn't blink or visibly move. He just stood. Kip and Sway sat on a desk, deep in conversation. He envied that, thenrelationship his best friend had with Sway. He'd never had that, thencloseness they shared. Of course, he had an ulterior motive for wanting tonbe that close to Sway - she was hot! And speaking of hot. . . . . He scanned the room looking for Rachel, and when he located her he suckednin a sharp breath. Rachel, along with everyone else, had changed into herndarks ready for the night ahead. But, where as Sway, in her black leathernpants and dark grey baby-T looked hot, Rachel looked lethal! She sported baggy black cargo pants that hung low on her hips, and a tightnback T-shirt that left a slither of her midriff bare. She carried blacknwell, with her dark features, dark hair and pale skin. She looked dangerousnand untouchable, and that fact made Tumbler want her even more. As he gazed on, she slowly turned her head in his direction, obviouslynaware that someone was watching her. She gave Tumbler a long level stare, ancigarette poised between her fingers. Eventually he looked away hurriedly and scurried off. Man, that girl hadnhim whipped! *** .6.55pm. Memphis stepped out into the fading twilight and adjusted dark glasses overnhis eyes. He placed what he had just collected into the inside pocket ofnhis jacket and sighed. He'd known form the second that that bomb had rippednthrough his garage that he had to do this, but it still terrified him tonthe core. The thought of what was to come, the possible upshot to hisnactions. Looking down at his watch he noticed that it was 6.55pm and as he began tonwalk back to his car he pulled out his cell phone. He dialled a number andnfished his car keys from his pocket as he stood besides a glisteningnEleanor. After 3 rings someone answered. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, its Memphis. Can you be at the garage within the next half hour? Inmay need your help with something.\" \"Do I get to find out what this 'something' is?\" \"Can you make it?\" Memphis repeated. The other person paused for a second before replying. \"Sure. See you inn20.\" Memphis disconnected and climbed into his car. It was almost 7pm and henknew that everyone would be waiting for him, but as he drove down thenstreet his thoughts were only of one person. For he knew that by the end ofnthe day his and Sways lives would be significantly changed, one way ornanother. .End Chapter 23. AN/ sorry it's not so long or action packed, but it needed to be done. Nextnchapter, find out who Memphis was talking to and join the crew as they getnback to business. Happy 18th Birthday Amy. x[Chapter 26] Chapter 22. .7.02pm... At 7.02pm Sway sighed at the familiar rumble of Memphis's Mustang in thendriveway. It wasn't like him to be late, and although she'd never ask, shencouldn't help but wonder what he'd been up to. He walked over and sat down next to her \"Hey.\" \"Hey yourself. The troops are all here, ready to go. And I mean *all*.\" Shenjerked her head in Sphinx's direction. \"Shit.\" He rubbed his hand over his face in a frustrated gesture \"I'm gonnanhave to go talk with him. He shouldn't be here.\" \"Rach saw him before, and she said he seems fine.\" Sway offered. \"Rachel? Rachel saw Sphinx?\" She shrugged \"Go figure huh? That's Sphinx, expect the unexpected!nApparently they shot a couple of hoops and he left. I don't know. Nothingnhe does surprises me anymore.\" \"Basketball?\" Memphis questioned \"Hey,\" he grinned \"you reckon old Sphinxynhas a crush?\" Sway laughed \"Honey, I'm not even sure if Sphinx has internal organs, letnalone emotions!\" His grin widened and he rose to his feet. \"I'm still gonna have to talknwith him. Cant risk anymore screw ups.\" \"Sure.\" Sway shrugged and looked over to where Sphinx stood silent andnalone in the shadows. As always. *** Memphis returned a couple of minutes later, his looked steely, hisndemeanour pissed. \"Let me guess,\" Sway pulled another cigarette from the packet with hernteeth \"He's staying right?\" \"Looks that way.\" \"Don't worry about it Memphis,\" She mumbled as she lit her smoke \"He'll benfine.\" \"Yeah well I already called someone else. Asked them to come join us. Evennif Sphinx is staying, we had a spare space, why not fill it.\" As if on cue the door of the garage banged open and a joyful voice rangnout. \"Weeeeeeell! Aint it a sassy little crew we got goin' on here Rainy-boy!\" \"Oh for fucks sakes.\" Sway hissed under her breath \"Memphis, get rid ofnhim, get rid of him now.\" Frankie Fish was a short, wiry, greasy little man and had always remindednSway of a weasel. He wore loud clothes and had a voice to match. He lovednto stir up trouble and was the bane of most people's existence. However,nFrankie had an amazing and unfitting talent for wheeling, dealing andnpretty much any illegal activity you could think of. He was brilliant atn*everything*, and unfortunately, he knew it. The fact that he knew hownvaluable he was to *all* the players in the city added up to one thing.nFrankie was an asshole. Memphis smiled tightly at him \"Hey. Thanks for coming.\" \"No problem my friend, when people need The Fish they need The Fish!\" Henshook Memphis's hand limply and quickly scanned his surroundings. \"Phew! Wenreally do have a gathering going on here don't we Rainy-boy!\" \"Mmmm.\" Memphis agreed his false smile still stuck firmly in place. \"If it isn't old chatterbox over there in the corner.\" He grinned at Sphinxnwho flicked out his switchblade and glared. \"Yeah. Listen Frankie, here's the deal. We got..\" Memphis started beforenFrankie cut him off. \"Sway! How's it going hot stuff?\" Frankie walked over to her and made anmove to kiss her hand. \"Don't even try it!\" She snapped. Frankie chuckled \"Still as sassy as ever I see hot stuff. Man, I missednyou. And you know, you could show a little courtesy towards me, what withnme coming all the way down here to help your boyfriend and all!\" He reachednout and drew a finger down the side of Sways face. She closed her eyes in disgust and turned her face away. Memphis couldnpractically see the blood boiling under her skin and could have sworn hernheard her growl. \"Who the fuck do you think you are! Get your dirty little mitts off ofnher.\" Frankie whipped around and stared at Rachel. \"I could ask you the samenthing honey. You don't talk to the Fish like that, you hear me?\" Rachel stood for a second, dumfounded by his bottle, before getting herncomposure back \"Don't even *try* to tell me what to do.\" She seethed. \"Rainy-boy!\" Frankie called not taking his eyes off Rachel \"I think you'dnbetter explain to this little honey, that we are always, *always* nice tonthe Fish if we want his services.\" \"Rachel..\" Memphis started before Rachel cut him off. \"Did you just call me 'little honey'?\" She asked malice punctuating hernevery word. \"Rachel! Leave it.\" Memphis warned. She whipped around to look at him. \"Are you serious? This asshole needs anslap!\" \"Excuse me!\" Frankie flung his hands in the air \"Asshole?\" He strodenforwards and with a surprisingly strong grip, wrapped his hand aroundnRachel's neck. Not hard enough to cut off her air, but hard enough so thatnshe daren't move. \"Nobody, NOBODY!\" He spat at her \"Calls me an asshole honey. Okay! I can donwhat the fuck I like you stupid little bitch!\" He shook her \"Frankie.\" Memphis tried to reason with him. \"Let her go okay.\" \"Shut the hell up Rainy-boy! I am NOT happy okay? Don't make it any worse.\" \"Get off her.\" Sway hissed, \"Now!\" \"Ooooooh! Hot stuff's getting ballsy now too is she? Rainy you shouldnreally try to keep your BITCHES under control!\" He screamed the last fewnwords in Rachel's face. \"Come on Frankie calm down.\" Otto said gently. \"No! Why should I? I want that bitch,\" He jerked his head in Swaysndirection \"to apologise to me, and I want this bitch,\" he shook Rachelnagain \"to grovel! And then get the hell out of here!\" \"Why don't you get the hell outta here?!\" Mirror stepped forwards. \"Mirror-man! Shut the fuck up!\" Memphis warned. \"I'm waiting.\" Frankie sang at Rachel, ignoring Mirror's comments \"Grovelnhoney, grovel good!\" \"Memphis!\" Sway yelled \"You'd better make this asshole leave. Now! We don'tnneed him.\" \"Shut up Sway!\" He yelled back \"You're not helping here!\" \"You still have to apologise yet hot stuff. I suggest you pay attention tonyour boyfriend!\" He turned back to Rachel \"Well come on. Get grovelling,nHoney!\" \"Drop dead.\" She hissed, and then she spat in his face. Frankie stood stunned for a second, and then his grip on Rachel's neck gotntighter and he exploded \"YOU FUCKING STUPID LITTLE WHORE! DIRTY LITTLEnBITCHES SPIT! YOU SHOULD BE STRUNG UP AND.\" There was a flash of something in Rachel's left eye and then Frankiencrumpled to the floor. She stepped back and sucked in a lungful of air hernhead bowed. \"Shit Rach.\" Sway ran over, barging past Memphis \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm fine.\" She looked up to where tumbler stood, massaging his fist andnstanding over an unconscious Frankie. She smiled \"Thanks man.\" He grinned back at her and nudged Frankie with his foot \"No problem.\" \"Jerk needed a damn smack if you ask me!\" Mirror enthused, slapping tumblernon the back. \"You did us all a favour!\" \"Yeah? And what the hell are we gonna do now?\" Memphis shook his head \"Wenneeded him.\" \"No we didn't.\" Sway said coldly \"We're fine on our own. There's nothingnwrong with Sphinx!\" She gestured over at him \"And even if there was Indidn't think you'd ever subject us to *that*!\" She punctuated her last wordnby giving Frankie a swift kick in the stomach. \"Sway!\" He raised his eyebrows. \"Oh just leave it Memphis!\" She spat. \"Otto! Gimme a boost sheet. Rachel,nyou're coming with me.\" Memphis shook his head in exasperation \"Fine! Get angry. Why change thenhabit of a lifetime Sway!\" \"Oh grow up!\" She hissed snatching a sheet from Otto and striding towardsnthe door \"I'll leave you to clear this mess up seeing as you got us intonit. Oh and Memphis?\" She stopped in her tracks but didn't turn aroundn\"Don't ever tell me to shut up.\" \"Don't give me Goddamn orders then!\" He yelled as she left the building. Anhand on his shoulder stopped him as he started after her and he turned andnlooked over at Otto. \"Leave her.\" He said softly \"Leave her to cool down. We have work to do.\" Memphis stared at his oldest friend for a second before nodding softly andnturning back towards the group, all of whom had all shrunk back from thenfight. \"Tumbler! Put Frankie upstairs.\" He snapped \"And you lot, get boosting!\" *** .7.25pm. Rachel glanced across at her friend; they had been driving around inncomplete silence for about 10 minutes. Sway was slumped down in her seat,nher eyes dark and angry, her face hard-set. She wrenched the tan FordnEstate into 5th in another vicious gear change, and Rachel raised herneyebrows. \"You keep doing that and we're gonna be walking to this boost.\" \"Doing what?\" Sway mumbled \"Slamming this poor little hunk of shit through its paces. It's a Fordnhoney, not a tank.\" \"Don't call me honey.\" \"Oh give it a rest Sway. This is me you're talking to. I'll call you what Ingoddamn like.\" \"Alright! Fine. Sweetheart!\" \"Sugar!\" \"Love!\" \"Baby doll!\" Sway laughed, she couldn't help it. \"Baby doll?\" Rachel grinned, \"Tumbler.\" She said by way of explanation. \"Ahhhh. He really has no clue does he?\" Rachel laughed and pulled a pack of cigarettes from her pocket. \"Nope. I'vennever seen any guy make this much of a fool of himself over and overnagain.\" \"Give him credit. His shot at Frankie was a serious thumbs up.\" \"Mmmm.\" Rachel nodded as she lit up and swung a foot up to rest on the dashn\"The first sign of the real him I've seen.\" \"Plus, at least he didn't just stand around with his thumb up his ass likensome people.\" She scowled out of the window. \"Give him a break Sway. This is really hard for Memphis, he's just tryingnto do what he thinks is right. I think what happened this afternoon withnJohnny really shit him up you know.\" \"Shit him up! What about me!\" She took the cigarette Rachel offered. \"You're not the one who's fault it is though are you? Imagine if the tablesnwere turned. How would you feel? Would you have hired Frankie if younthought it would help keep *him* safe?\" Sway fell silent and kept looking ahead. They rode for another few minutesnin silence, until Rachel finished her smoke and flicked the butt out thenpassenger window. \"Hey, you know what we just did?\" She asked rolling her window back up. \"What?\" \"Girl talk!\" She grinned and wiggled her eyebrows at Sway. \"You tell anyone, I'll kill ya.\" \"Right back atcha.\" *** End Chapter 22 ***[Chapter 27] Chapter 23. For the next few hours Otto sat at his desk and watched as car after beautiful car rolled in, and then out again. Ferraris, Porsches, Lamborghinis, BMW's. Few words were spoken, what needed to be said? Otto intentionally paired Sway with Rachel for most of her boosts. They did not need any more trouble and the girls worked well together. They returned with another car, the sheen of adrenalin-fuelled excitement, still holding in their eyes. \"Hey there ladies. How's it going?\" Otto asked pulling another boost sheet from the pile. \"Fan-fucking-tastic!\" Rachel beamed \"I just got Belle. That car is hot shit; I always wanted to drive one of those!\" Belle was a 1995 Maclaren F1. Otto grinned and handed her the piece of paper. \"I'm gonna sit this one out Rach.\" Sway called over her shoulder as she strolled to the back of the garage and sank into a chair. \"Ok. Whatever man. See you later.\" She gave Otto a quick look and turned on her heel just as Mirror and Tumbler walked through the door. \"Hey Tyson!\" She called, \"Fancy a ride in a Lambo?\" Tumbler grinned \"Sure.\" After a while Memphis returned alone from a boost and Otto listened to the unmistakable roar of an old Porsche as his pick was driven away. The old man took a deep breath preparing himself for fireworks. \"Hey son. How's it goin?\" He asked sorting another sheet from the tangle on his desk. \"Yeah. Okay.\" Memphis had barely strung together one full sentence since the earlier trouble with Frankie. Debating whether to bring it up, but deciding it was better sorted now rather than in the crucial last few hours of the boost, Otto jerked his thumb over his shoulder in Sway's direction \"I think you got someone waiting for you back there. Been here a while.\" Memphis's eyebrows shot up and he stood still for a second before advancing towards the back of the garage. Otto buried his head in paperwork and prayed for patience. Memphis stood in front of Sway and neither party spoke for a good few seconds. \"Hey.\" She finally ventured. \"Hey yourself.\" Sway pulled her cigarettes from her pocket and tapped the pack on her leg to shake one free. \"I wish you wouldn't\" Memphis gestured at the box. \"Why?\" She raised a smoke to her lips anyway, defiantly. \"Because I don't like it when you smoke, it reminds me too much of old times, and the reasons you did it.\" \"The old times are the best baby.\" She smiled insincerely and lit the cigarette. Memphis made an indignant noise. \"Come on,\" Sway gestured around \"You're not enjoying this? Even just a little?\" \"No. I'm really not.\" He pulled up a chair. \"This seriously isn't my idea of fun.\" \"Are you shittin' me!? The cars, the adrenaline – \" \"The guns, the cops?\" Sway fell silent and Memphis kicked back in his chair, wiping a hand across his face. \"Sway, I'm really sorry about Frankie okay?\" She let out an infuriated snort and he shook his head softly. \"I know. I know he's a complete asshole and it was a stupid thing to do getting him out here, but I didn't know what else to do okay.\" He gestured forcefully with one hand. \"Things were falling apart at the seams here. I'm not as good at this as I used to be. I'm older and I'm wiser but I have more to lose; and I can't lose this bet Sway. I just can't . I have too much riding on it.\" \"We won't.\" She said \"We might.\" He lent back in his chair and pushed the heels of his hands against his eyes. Sway sat for a second watching the strong powerful man she thought she knew crumbling before he and her resolve faded. \"No Memphis,\" He sat upright and looked at her as she leant forwards and placed her hands on his knees \"We will not lose. We're doing great okay, you're doing great! We can do this.\" He frowned and searched her deep, rich eyes. \"I hope you're right.\" \"I am.\" \"You know we could just leave.\" He stared at her earnestly and she sat back looping her fingers behind her head. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.\" \"You could have died today.\" \"I could have died plenty of times in the past Memphis. It comes with the territory.\" \"I was young and stupid in the past. I didn't know what I had to lose.\" \"Yeah well you haven't lost anything now. I'm fine.\" She winked at him playfully but his expression remained serious. \"No you're not. You're far from fine.\" They stared silently at one another for a few seconds, Sway remaining defiant before Memphis sighed and rubbed a hand over his face again. \"But I guess that's something I'll have to deal with when this is all over.\" She raised an eyebrow \"What's that supposed to mean?\" He didn't reply and Sway narrowed her eyes. \"I told you Memphis, I'm fine. Full working order. You don't have to worry about me okay.\" \"But I do. And I can't help that. I know you Sway, you're fine whilst you've still got so much to think about. As soon as this all stops it will hit you and it's a big weight this time. Just promise me you won't do anything crazy.\" He reached over and took her hand. She stood up and moved so that she was straddling his lap. \"I promise.\" She whispered in his ear. Memphis sighed and wrapped his arms tightly around her waist enjoying the feeling of her warm breath against the shell of his ear. A sound of a voice being cleared pulled them from their own little world and Memphis growled. It was Otto. \"Hey guys, I'm sorry, but I thought I'd better give you something.\" He passed Sway a boost sheet. \"Yeah baby.\" Sway smiled and turned the piece of paper around to show Memphis what was written upon it. Amy – Ferrari F40 For the final few hours as the fiery orange sun forced its way up over the water, the gang raced around for an array of last minute boosts. Sway remained teamed up with Rachel, the small piece of paper with the F40's location written upon it tucked tightly into her back pocket. Within the haze of shiny, expensive boosts Memphis's voice suddenly floated across the airwaves. \"Oh Swaaaaaaaay!\" He called, his voice laced with a school boy taunt. \"What?\" She asked cautiously. \"I just trampled your little record sweetie. 25 seconds! Beat that!\" \"Yeah you do!\" Mirror man interjected. \"Can anyone verify that one boss man?\" Rachel quizzed as she glanced across at Sway a sly little grin on her face. \"Yep.\" Donny answered \"25 on the dot. Sorry ladies.\" \"Hey, it aint over yet little boys okay, we still got 90 minutes till this bet ends!\" Rachel retorted. \"Yeah!\" Sway cut in, \"and Raines, I'm gonna kick your ass little boy.\" \"Sure you are, s weetheart .\" Sway could hear the humour and cockiness dripping from his voice. \"We've resorted to name calling now have we?\" Rachel asked. Memphis laughed. \"I'm sorry girls, but I think you'll have a job beating 25. I'm going to be boosting that lovely shiny F40 for sure!\" \"Not a chance.\" Sway replied slowly. \"Come on Sway!\" Memphis laughed \"A bet's a bet. I bet you the boost of the Ferrari that I could beat you!\" \"Fine.\" Sway swung her feet up onto the dash of the pickup that Rachel was driving. \"You let me boost the F40, and I will beat your time.\" \"Kinda defies the point.\" \"I bet you my 'vette.\" \"Ooooooh!\" Mirror chuckled from his boost \"this is getting interesting.\" \"Shut up Mirror.\" Memphis cut in \"You'd never give me you 'vette.\" \"Yes I would,\" Sway replied, \"If I lost. Like you said, a bets a bet.\" \"This was a bet and you backed out of this.\" \"No I didn't. I raised the stakes.\" Memphis let out a bark of laughter. \"Okay you're on. But I want the skirt we talked about earlier too.\" \"Sure why not.\" Sway sighed \"Throw whatever you want in there, because you know I'm gonna kick you ass.\" \"We'll see.\" \"Yes we will. Me and my Amy will see you paying up.\" \"What am I paying up if I loose then?\" Memphis smiled to himself. \"A new bike.\" Memphis chuckled a shook his head \"It's a bet.\" Sway grinned at Rachel and tipped her head back in her seat \"Amy here I come baby!\" \"Ah! This is so fixed!\" Mirror exclaimed. \"I knew you'd get her. How come you get all the good cars?!\" \"When you're screwing the boss we'll let you boost what you want.\" Sway responded. Rachel let out a bark of laughter and Memphis cleared his throat uncomfortably. \"Yeah. Okay, no offence Memphis but I'm good.\" Mirror muttered quickly. Rachel laughed again. \"Anyway!\" Memphis said loudly \"Finish up, and everyone back to the garage for the last run. We'll pair up and pick up the last 5 ladies. Bring on the home straight.\" Otto sat back and watched as the entire crew gathered for the final time (or so he hoped) in his garage. His chest twinged again, and he resisted the urge to wince. He was far too damn old for all this stress now. When this was over, he was going to sell his share of the garage and set his Junie up a nice little house somewhere. And what's more, he was going to visit the doctor. Memphis stood quietly, his hands in his pockets, looking out of the doors at the gathering sunlight. 6am. Such a beautiful time of day, he had to start getting up earlier. He'd decided that these few boosts would be their last of the bet, regardless of the two hours of boosting time that still remained. It was too risky to work at such a busy time of day. A flock of birds swooped across the skyline, forming and elegant silhouette. \"I have to start getting up earlier\" he thought. For the first time since she arrived, Rachel opted against being alone and strolled over to where Tumbler sat picking idly at his finger nails. He looked up as she approached him, unable to hide the look of dumb shock on his face. \"Hey.\" She leaned against the wall next to him. \"Hi.\" He replied disbelief and slight caution in his voice. \"I think I lost my partner to the boss.\" She nodded over at Sway \"Fancy teaming for the last boost?\" \"Depends.\" Tumbler relaxed instantly and grinned up at her. \"On what?\" She raised an eyebrow. \"Are you gonna let me drive?\" \"Ha! Don't push it boy scout.\" Tumbler laughed. Sway ran her finger over the piece of paper in her hand and smiled to herself. She had dreamed of getting back in an F40 for such a long time. She was going to love every minute of it. And then, that was it; they could go back to their lives. The apartment, the garage, the touring build. A little twinge of grief for her ruined bike flowed through her. Her dad had left her the money for the Yamaha before he died, she'd always wanted one and it was special to her. Maybe she would really let Memphis buy her a new one, maybe not. Nothing would ever replace that particular bike. It was hard to believe that just over 48 hours ago she'd been riding it, hard to believe that this whole thing had been started by the explosion of one Yamaha R6.One hell of a starters pistol.

Disclaimer - Unfortunately I do not own the wonder that is gone in 60nseconds (booho"},{"Movie":"Gone In 60 Seconds","Title":"And It All Started With a Cup of Coffee","Author":"Chaosia Guadimus","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664926","Passage":"[Chapter 1] *Okay, this is officially my first fanfiction ever published anywhere and seeing as how I'm currently writing a script for classes and a personal project, then I figured I needed to get used to the whole publishing idea and getting feedback and reviews to improve whatever method I develop. That being said, this is going to be the first in a (hopefully) long and interesting arc. This is the introduction of the GISS crew members Atley and the Sphinx to one of my original creations, that will tie into everything I'm working on and help bridge the massive crossover that refuses to leave my brain alone! Oh, and props to Spike Daft for picking such a perfectly badass car for the Sphinx that I had to borrow it, so the glory of the blue 69 Malibu is all yours.* And It Started With Coffee The heat of the summer day was particularly stifling around noon of that fateful day. What made it even worse was the solid black, non-descript clothing that they were being forced to wear for this scout, and the lack of precious air conditioning in the 1969 Chevelle Malibu. Tumbler watched, shifting his position in the backseat (again) as Kip groaned, leaning up to turn on the air for the fifth time in an hour. A strong, hard hand caught his wrist in a firm grip mere centimeters from the knob, causing the younger boost to groan louder than before while Atley shook his head from the passenger seat. \"Now, Kip. There's no reason to mess with the air if you'll just take off that damn wool coat in the car.\" Tumbler, nodded, agreeing as the Sphinx let go of Kip's wrist, allowing the man to retreat into the relative safety of the backseat as he rubbed the abused spot. \"It's not my fault we have to sit here and watch for this damn ass wipe on the hottest damn day of the year. And why can't we just turn up the air a little?\" The Sphinx glared at both boys in the rearview mirror, silently promising them a painful and agonizing demise if they both didn't quit whining and fidgeting. It was worse than bloody children . . . All heads turned as they heard the signature engine of their lady pull up. Even the Sphinx let a low whistle as the gleaming cherry red 1998 Mercedes McLaren F1 pulled up to the coffee house they'd been casing all damn day, all shiny bits and gleaming curves. Atley nodded to Sphinx as he opened the door the same time as the larger man, telling both of the younger boosts, \" Behave and do not mess with the air or the radio. I can't keep him from killing both of you idiots again if he gets it in his head. We'll be right back.\" Tumbler hung his head out of the open window, hollering, \"Bring me a low fat latte with a protein shot! And extra whipped cream!\" The Sphinx shook his head, eyes traveling over the parked car as he went in the door of the Starbucks after Atley. It still amazed him that the two idiots had taken this particular boost, especially after how badly the last one went. He and Atley had agreed to help out of boredom and Atley's fear of Memphis's reaction to the dilemma. As they approached the counter, Atley pulled out a card and started \"perusing the menu\" like the other eighty million people in the shop, all the while never taking his eyes off the mark or his keys. Sphinx turned, intent on going to secure a window seat so he could watch the bloody idiots in his car, when he was smashed into and effectively soaked with searing coffee and what appeared to be a piece of coffee cake. He looked down at his ruined shirt and stained peacoat, feeling his anger boil. He looked up, prepared to wring the neck of whatever just drenched him when he saw just who had drenched him. There, standing in front of him in a pair of torn up jeans, grey converses, a faded blue The Coral tee shirt and a grey members only jacket, was a girl that looked frighteningly familiar. She looked up, her large tortoise shell glasses almost falling off her nose as she opened and closed her mouth repeatedly, looking at his stained clothes and her own ruined outfit. Finally it registered as she pushed her glasses up her nose, dropping the huge messenger tote she had slung over her shoulder as she grabbed napkins from the counter and, to Sphinx's amazement, started trying to wipe and blot her ruined coffee of his coat. \"I am so sorry! I am such klutz! I promise if it stains just send me the bill and I'll buy you a new one-\" He cut her off, waving her away as he growled and took off the coat, shaking it free of all debris save the coffee that was soaked into the wool. He rolled his eyes as he lowered the coat then almost groaned at the look she was giving him. Why was it every time he shed a coat everyone looked at him like he was crazy? Even Sway looked at him shocked when he was in just shirt and pants. His scowl darkened as he glared at her staring at him. Suddenly, she snapped out of whatever daze she was in, looking from his torso to his face, blushing as she looked into his eyes. He was amazed as she smiled bashfully and her sea blue eyes lit up with mirth and embarrassment. \"Sorry . . . Can I get you a coffee to make up for it?\" He was saved from not answering as Atley walked up behind him, handing a cup of strong, black coffee over his shoulder. \"God, Sphinx. What happened to you? Get in a fight with the barista or something?\" The girl blushed even darker as she shook her head, stepping forward. \"No, he just had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, namely anywhere I am with food and hot drinks in hand while walking.\" Atley smiled, shaking his head as he moved around his friend to get a better view of the girl. She was pretty in a bookworm way, her mass of chocolate and caramel curls barely contained in the knot at her neck while the glasses hid most of her face and made her eyes seem huge at the same time. \"He'll be fine, trust me. He's survived worse than coffee and crumb cake. I'm Atley and this is Sphinx. Care to join us? You can even spill my latte if it'll make you feel better.\" She laughed, picking her bag up and following Atley to a window seat, leaving Sphinx to trail behind as he shook his sleeve, trying to dislodge the puddling coffee from his coat before he sat beside Atley. The girl, still blushing, put her hand out to Atley. \"I'm Chaosia. It's nice to meet you, Atley. Sphinx. Do you guys live in Long Beach?\" Atley nodded while Sphinx took draughts from his coffee, making sure he was never put in the position to answer her directly, letting Atley steer the conversation while he kept an eye on the mark. It was a bleeding miracle that the sod hadn't left while he was swimming in coffee and crumb cake. Atley smiled to her, answering her questions. \"Yeah, we both actually live pretty close to here. Sphinx is just around the corner a piece while I'm about ten minutes away.\" She brightened, laughing as she looked at Sphinx. \"Really, I'm just moving to this side of town from the University area. It's closer to work and the actual beach. Maybe I'll actually know someone around here other than my brother.\" He turned an eye back to the girl, Chaosia. She was looking out the window at the McLaren. He snorted. Of course she would look at the most expensive car in the bloody lot. Atley, noticing where her gaze landed, asked, \"Beautiful isn't it?\" She surprised both boosters by snorting and saying, \"Yeah if you want it to be stolen before you've had it two days. Sure it's pretty but it can't compare to a Classic or American Muscle\". She shifted, looking around the parking lot and smiled as she spotted something she liked. \"Take that Chevelle Malibu. Late 60's model that either been well cared for, restored or both. That's a car to take pride in and show off, not something that the price tag alone could give Trump a heart attack. Sure whoever has it paid a lot, but that money could have been spent a lot better ways than on a car that the value depreciated more than it cost to manufacture the damn thing.\" She looked at both of them, taking in their stunned faces as she blushed and looked back out the window , saying, \"Sorry, just my opinion. Just ignore the idiot on her soapbox.\" Atley smirked then turned serious as the mark actually walked past them to leave, casting a look back over his shoulder at their new friend and nodded his head to her as she turned and looked at him, curious as to why both of her tablemates were watching him. He smirked to the girl as she raised a brow, then rolled her eyes and turned back to Sphinx and Atley, completely snubbing the suited pretty boy in McLaren. Both men turned to her, rising to leave as she bent to get her bag. She quickly pulled out a notepad, scratching out a number and note on the top piece of paper and thrusting it into Sphinx's massive hand. \"Here. If the coat doesn't come clean, just call and I'll pay to replace it. That or if you want to listen to me ramble on and on about ultra expensive cars and the douche bags that drive them . . . Well, anyway, it was nice to meet you, Atley. Sphinx. Talk to you later.\" And with that, she was collecting her belongings as the duo started to the door, Atley quietly ribbing Sphinx the whole time. As they crossed the street, Atley turned back and waved to the girl in the window, laughing as she waved back. When they opened the car door, even the horrid rap crap that Tumbler and Kip were blasting couldn't make Atley's grin disappear, or bring a true scowl to the stoic Sphinx's visage. He did, however, turn off the radio completely and rev the engine loudly as he pulled out into traffic quickly, causing both men in the back to be slung into the floor as he turned into the same spot the McLaren had just vacated to turn around. Chaosia was walking out the door as he was pulling away, and almost dropped her stuff again as she realized that the very car she'd admired was what her poor victim was driving. She blushed scarlet as Atley waved and Sphinx nodded to her, while both idiots in the back screamed bloody murder as he peeled away. As they regained lost ground to the McLaren, Tumbler looked up at Atley in confusion. \"Who was the chick?\" Atley smirked, \"A girl that spilled coffee all over the Sphinx and lived to tell the tale. She felt so bad about it, that she invited us to sit with her and even gave the big guy her number.\" Kip looked up in shock as Tumbler laughed, clapping the sinister man on the shoulder before regaining his sense and removing the hand before he lost it. \"Way to go, dude. And all you had to do was get doused with hot coffee. Not bad.\" Kip looked at Atley, whispering, \"Think he'll call her?\" Atley, smirking started to answer, only to be silenced when the Sphinx actually spoke, glaring at his passengers as he pulled into the parking garage two cars behind the target. \"None of your bloody business, you sissies. And it isn't anybody else's business either, so keep this to your bleeding selves.\" Atley laughed as he parked and got out of the car to take pictures of the mark after the suited pretty boy was gone. Atley turned to their charges, \"Yeah, I think he might call her. But that's going to be a great conversation. She got good taste in cars, though.\" Nothing else was said as the Sphinx got back into the Chevelle, glaring at the cackling boys in the back seat. As they pulled in at Otto's shop, Sphinx killed the engine and got out of the car, making his way into the paint dock as the trio tailed him, talking about his \"latest conquest\". Memphis asked what had him in such a mood and where they'd been, just to be silenced as he pushed past him to go and stand behind Sway and Donnie, daring either of the three to speak a word. At least the others wouldn't be informed. To tell about the girl would be to open up discussion of why they were together and looking at that particular place and car anyway. Atley was going to be hell later but for now, he was safe. He barely realized he was fingering the folded paper in his pocket the whole time they were together. As Junie and Sway brought out the pizzas for their little impromptu get together, Freb asked, \"Hey, dude. Where is your coat? Don't you like live in that thing or something?\" Atley smirked as Tumbler and Kip erupted into peels of laughter, causing everyone else to stare. Sway, never one to be left in the dark, demanded to know what was going on. Atley, smirked. \"Oh, Sphinx and I went for coffee earlier before we got here and Sphinx got a coffee shower courtesy of a pretty little thing with big glasses and a soft spot for a certain late 60's model Chevelle Malibu. Sweet little thing was so worried about hitting him with her coffee that she even offered to get him a new coat and gave her his number if he couldn't get it cleaned.\" Suddenly, he was the topic of discussion as he glared at Atley and the idiots. As Mikhail walked in and joined the conversation, Sphinx was concrete on planning just how to tell Memphis that not only was his brother boosting with Tumbler but that Atley was enabling him, just as soon as he got away from all of these buffoons and broke Mirror Man's jaw for asking about the girl' ass. When Chaosia got home from work later that night, she was dragging. She groaned, tossing her bag and coat on the couch as she passed through the living room into the kitchen. She was navigating boxes and plastic storage containers, trying to find a glass she hadn't packed to move into her new apartment across town when a blinking light caught her attention. She crossed to her phone and answering machine, curious as to who would leave her any messages. She listened to her brother drone on about the safety issue in Long Beach and how she needed to be ready for anything. And how happy he was that she was finally leaving the University area for a more upscale location that was safer. She rolled her eyes as he told her to scout the area around her new apartment before she moved. Did he think she was stupid or something? That was what she was doing earlier before work. She'd been to scope out the local restaurants, grocers and gas stations. She'd even found a few shops she wanted to look in, after she moved. And her apartment was only two blocks from a Starbucks, meaning coffee before work and class was much more feasible now that it wasn't fifteen minutes out of the way. She blushed as she remembered the incident earlier with the quiet man and his talkative friend. She couldn't believe she'd drowned the poor man in coffee then tried to talk him to death. If his friend Atley hadn't been present she would still have been floundering about with napkins and apologies flying. God, she hoped her brother never found out about that, or she would hear about how she was living up to her namesake for the rest of eternity. She started moving boxes again as she listened to the second message from her brother, telling her he had friends he wanted her to meet when she was settled and how a few were even going to help her move. She smiled ruefully at the machine. Her brother was always trying to take care of her, even though he couldn't take care of himself most days . . . She was secretly glad that these new friends of his had helped keep him out of the majority of the trouble he could find by himself. Now if someone could just keep her from assaulting the tall, dark and silent types with coffee and crumb cakes in Starbucks they might just be alright . . . Her black cat picked that moment to hop up on the nearest box, demanding her attention. She laughed, telling the cat all about the coffee incident as she scratched and petted him. \"He had the prettiest grey green eyes . . .\" A vaguely familiar voice filled her small apartment, causing her to jump and look around. Finally, her eyes rested on the answering machine. \"Hey, Chaosia. This is Atley, from earlier? Well, I just wanted to call and tell you that-\" She could hear the commotion of a ruckus and several different voices shouting and cursing as she got up and moved closer to the machine, hoping to make out the rest of the message. \"Oh, that's great, just let her think you're weirder than she already thinks you big lug-\" *BEEP* She stood, almost afraid to hear the next message. It was more of the same, save this voice was younger and definitely in some kind of pain, \"Hey, you don't know me but the number to reach the Sphin- *BEEP *\" Finally, after three more messages like that, and in one she could swear she heard her brother's laughter in the background, she got a shock. A strong British tinged voice filled her apartment. \"This is Sphinx. You'll have to pardon the idiots, but Atley and the lads thought it's be funny to call and try to do-well, who knows what they were going to try to do. Don't worry about the coat, luv. Instead, just buy me a cup of coffee tonight and we'll call it even. Just call back at 555-853-9119 if you decide to. If I don't answer, just talk. I'll be at work but I'll hear you. G'night, Chaos.\" She sat on the floor, stumped as she looked at her watch. It was only ten and the coffee shop wouldn't close for another hour and a half, if she went now, they could talk or give his clothes time to dry should she trip again. She grabbed the phone, dialing the number and waiting with baited breath as it rang. When the other end picked up but no one answered, she started to talk. \"Um? Sphinx? If you want to meet for coffee, then meet me at the same Starbucks in about fifteen minutes. And bring another shirt just in case I trip again. Okay?\" She heard a chuckle before she was answered. \"Okay, luv. I'll meet you there.\" And with that, the line was dead. As she rushed to put on a different tee shirt and grab a new jacket, she wondered what they would talk about, seeing as in how he apparently didn't talk much. As she pulled the red Cure tee shirt over her head and threw on her grey track jacket, she threw her reading glasses on the couch. She locked the door, grabbing her keys and shaking her hair loose as she practically bounced down the stairs to the garage. As she was jumping in her black 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 with white racing stripes, she laughed at the similarity in their cars. As she made her way back to the scene of the crime, she tried to fight her giddiness. Maybe, just maybe, she would find that they had more in common than just an appreciation of Chevelles.[Chapter 2] Here's chapter two. The actual, factual coffee date and alittle beyond. Yeah! Just to let you know, there will be some romance much later, but fear not. I'm going to try and stay as near to the characters as I can. Because for the life of me, any time I think of Sphinx (or Vinnie Jones himself for that matter) trolling through the park with flowers and chocolates to give to a girl, I laugh myself silly. So no fluffy mess or stupid stuff. And no, I'm not going to make him suddenly start just speaking for no reason. I've actually self imposed a limit of like three Sphinx quotes per chapter to keep to the personality that made the movie. Oh! And I forgot in the first chapter. DISCLAIMER : I OWN NOTHING BUT THE OCASSIONAL ORIGINAL CHARACTER AND ONE VERY OLD CHEVELLE SS THAT'S GOING TO EAT ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME IN GAS. Why Me? When she parked beside his car, she saw him sitting in the same spot from earlier, already sipping some drink and devoid of a coat. A beige member's only jacket was draped over the back of his chair, safely out of her reach, causing her to laugh out loud. When she ordered and sat, he shook his head, sipping what appeared to be coffee strong enough to kill a lesser man, if one went by smell anyway. He was wearing a heather blue tee shirt with dark jeans, cuffed once at his ankles and adorned with, surprisingly, suspenders rather than a belt. She smiled, sitting and actually avoided spilling anything on his clothes. \"I see you're already Chaos-proofed. So, do you want to talk or just enjoy the view?\" He smirked over his cup, \"The view. Nice SS. What is she?\" She leaned back, turning to see her car. \"An SS 396. She was a real junker when I found her, but my brother and I fixed her up.\" He nodded. \"Atley fixed mine, dropping a new motor in her and finished the restoration. How we met\". She talked, him mostly nodding but adding the occasional word here and there, enjoying the quiet and the cars. What surprised him was how easy going she was when she wasn't trying to scour his skin off with coffee or trying to grind it into him with napkins. She actually had this peculiar grace that came and went while she was speaking. If it was about cars or school, the grace was there . . . But when she had started talking about the move she was planning, she actually almost fell out of her seat and nearly tipped the table and their drinks. Her cheeks stayed crimson for the rest of the evening, matching her shirt almost perfectly. When they parted company to venture home, Chaosia handed Sphinx another number. \"That's my cell, if you're at work or can't talk, just text and it'll be fine. I can keep mine at the shop so no big deal. I'll see you later, Mr. Sphinx. Maybe we can eat lunch or something . . .\" He nodded, walking her to the door of her car and insuring she got in before he turned to go to his. As he started his Malibu, he had to marvel at the night's surprises. This was by far the easiest he'd ever had it when being around a member of the opposite sex, save Sway who still had those streaks where she could show her \"Inner Diva\" as Mirror Man liked to call it. But this girl hadn't wanted to hold an in-depth, meaningful conversation or hear about his feelings and why he moved or where his accent was from (thank God for small miracles there). She had been content to actually just chatter away and go on little to no feedback; just a nod here or there was all she needed to keep the flow of commentary going. Normally, that would set his nerves aflame, as was usually the case with Freb and Mirror Man, but with her it was a tolerable quality that she could fill the silence that he ensured hung around him, almost endearing. The fact she was a Chevelle girl didn't hurt either. He pulled into his own parking complex, and started making his way up the steps. It was when he got to his door that he realized that he'd been thinking about the girl-Chaos- the entire trip home. He shook his head. This was definitely going to change some things . . . Though he honestly didn't know what. All he did know was that he had a ten hour shift in the morgue tomorrow and he was going to need sleep. After changing into sweatpants and a Wales tee shirt, he ran a massive hand over his face as he settled on his couch to ignore the news. This was not the brightest idea he'd had by far. What the hell was he going to do? Go on windy walks and talk about feelings? But damn, the girl had only been in his life less than a day and he was already lost. He turned his eyes to the tele, grunting. \"Bloody hell. Women.\" The next few days passed a bit too by quickly for the Sphinx, but now that he was walking into Otto's he was sure everything would settle. He went to work per normal, working normal hours with the idiots in the morgue, and everything was fine until today. If those blighters sniveled at him one more time he was going to tear their knee-caps off and spoon feed them to them. Literally . Atley had called to let him know that they were supposed to go and help Dumb and Dumber, formerly known as Kip and Tumbler, pick up the McLaren tonight. And instead of just letting him get off the phone or sending him a text message (which Mirror Man and Sway had been kind enough to teach him how to use on his cellular a few days prior), Atley wanted to discuss his \"date\", knowing damn good and well that the two main idiots at his workplace were listening on the other extension. When he jokingly asked if anything had gotten \"hot and wet\", Richards had fallen into a dead faint at the reception desk. Atley purposely did that, knowing he was going to have to deal with this for the rest of the week until he terrified them back into submission. When he had growled at his associate over the phone, Atley had very smugly informed him that \"Payback is a bitch, Sphinx. And that's payback for ratting us out to Memphis.\" Sphinx snorted as he pushed open the door to the paint dock, breathing a silent prayer that no one was here save Otto and maybe Memphis. He had a camera to collect, after all. It wasn't entirely his fault that Kip had loaned the same camera to him that Memphis decided (with some prodding and a well placed glare) to look through the night of the get together. Served the bleeding morons right for the stunt with telling everyone his business and then the phone calls. He honestly hadn't called Chaos since the coffee thing, trying to let everything with the boost and the idiots settle themselves before attempting a civil get together, well as civil as he got anyway. Sway had actually helped him wrangle the others long enough to make the first call and set up the late rendezvous. Memphis had been terrorized into aiding his lover with the promise of a month on couch duty if he didn't do her bidding. A prime example, Mirror Man was quick to point out, of Sway's \"Inner Diva\". The fat lip the comment had earned him will hopefully serve as a reminder to what a powerful left hook the woman had when pissed (and to leave said diva qualities unsaid). He had, however been texting. And was seriously considering throwing his phone off a pier because the damned buttons were so tiny and cumbersome to utilize. Didn't these damn phone designers think of people with hands his size before doing shit like making tiny buttons? He shook his head, opening said atrocity and checking his messages. He had two new ones. One from Mikhail, and one from Chaos. He opened Mikhail's first, already sensing it would be about helping this pop-up half sister of his move. Well, if it didn't fall on Chaos's moving day, then he might lend a hand or tote a load. He smirked then frowned, remembering that Mikhail's sister was moving into his building, actually the flat right below his own. That was going to be a fun kettle of fish. He just hoped she was bearable and kept to herself or his business associate might be minus a sibling. Memphis was damn close to seeing that promise come to fruition these days anyway, so what's one more body to cart through the morgue? He grunted, hating he was right. What are you doing Saturday? My sis needs some help moving some stuff. I won't need help any longer than two hours. She swears that some new friend of hers maybe be able to help us move the heavy shit, so no big deal if you can't make it. Hit me back and let me know either way. Sphinx raised a brow. Now he knew he wasn't going unless absolutely necessary. Mikhail was a good lad and a smart boost, but he was fierce in the defense of his baby sister. Memphis even paled in comparison on most occasions. He smirked, almost feeling sorry for whatever poor bastard had to deal with the wiry boost. The next text was a goofy thing. Obviously, Chaos was bored to tears at the boutique she worked at. OMG! How do women spend enough money to replace my intake system in the Chevelle twice on a single pair of shoes? Its insane! Then they gripe because they can't buy another color of custom shoes. I hate women. I think I'd rather deal with the dead people today than the brain dead idiots with plastic. Hope you're having a good day. Miss u. He smirked, re-reading the last bit before frowning darkly and putting the cellular away. The girl was not going to get to him and make him all damn sappy and mushy. He hated blokes like that. Even Memphis lost points when he started following Sway around like a lovesick fool again. Better to stay calm and yourself than change. He looked up, seeing Mikhail enter the paint dock, covered in red and clear coat patches. He nodded to the man, then turned and re opened his phone, sending Chaos a brief text . Mikhail came back, drinking a bottle of water as he looked over Sphinx's shoulder to see what was going on just as he clapped the phone shut. Mikhail raised an eyebrow, then shrugged. His business was his business. \"So, you gonna be able to help Saturday?\" Sphinx shrugged as both men turned to see Atley, Tumbler and Kip enter the garage. All three visibly brightened as they laid eyes on Sphinx who rolled his own eyes skyward. Why him?[Chapter 3] How Do You Sway? Across town, Chaos was experiencing a similar dilemma, but not for the same reasons. The night of the date, she had parked her Chevelle, meandered her way up to her apartment and fed the cat. She'd showered,brushed teeth and pulled her hair top her head all in an autopilot daze, not really allowing herself think on anything. As she was laying in bed, she kept thinking that something was missing. She needed to do something, but what? Shower? Check. Cat? Check. Teeth? Check. Doors locked and bolted? Check and check. Clothes and books for tomorrow laid out? Check. She shrugged, slipping into a light doze, knowing whatever would survive if she just waited till tomorrow . . . She shot straight up, eyes wide and then groaned and flopped back against her pillows. She had to call Mikhail and tell him tomorrow about her coffee and that was going to be a wonderful endeavor. She pulled the pillows over her head, groaning into them as she lamented telling her over protective brother about her- \"My what, exactly? My coffee buddy I tried to kill when I first met him? God, Chaos. Get a grip. He's cool and whatever but he's strictly a coffee-and-cake friend, not a tell-brother-so-he-can-get-threatened-with-crow-bar-and-never-call-again friend. Besides, if he does turn out to be the latter, it'll be way later. Like months later, not hours. Jeez girl, get the hormones under control and concentrate on the move and school and work. Besides, he probably won't call you again after you almost scalded him twice.\" She looked down at her cat, who was looking at her with his head cocked to the side. She huffed, crossing her arms and turning her head to the side, before slumping her shoulders and groaning. \"I'm damn crazy, to talk to the cat about romance problems and the lack thereof. And doomed to think an older guy like that would want anything to do with a stick figure like me, huh?\" The cat meowed, coming to sit in her lap and purr. She smiled as she hugged the big tomcat, sighing to herself. \"I know, Cat. I'm crazy and you are, too, for sticking around with me.\" The cat meowed again as she shook her head laying down and trying to sleep. She grumbled, muttering, \"Bloody hell, Cat. Men.\" It was after the decision was made not to tell her brother about the incident and the exchange of numbers, that Chaosia found herself face to face with a very difficult situation. Mikhail had come into her work today, bringing two of his friends with him. He had just strolled in the vintage boutique and propped himself on a counter, wagging his eyebrows at her co-worker, before motioning his two shadows forward for proper introductions. \"Chaosia, this is Memphis Raines and Sway Wayland, two of my friends here in Long Beach. Memphis, Sway, this is my baby sister, Chaosia.\" She smiled, taking in the two before speaking. Memphis had sandy blondish brown hair that was done in an oddly conservative style for someone who hung around her brother. He was in dark slacks and a button up shirt with a light jacket over it, hands firmly in his coat pockets while he smiled warmly. A little geeky, but with that smile it was easy to like him. The girl, however, was exactly the type to be around her brother. Tall, built and with long blonde hair styled in twisted dreads that were secured at the back of her in a wild ponytail while the bands were pinned up front. She was wearing baggy cargo shorts, a tank top and a track jacket with the sleeves pushed up to allow all to see her tattoos. She smirked at Memphis then stuck a hand out to Chaosia. \"Just call me Sway, hun.\" Chaosia smiled, nodding and shaking her hand. Sway then surprised everyone and blushed, putting a hand behind her head as she laughed. \"Sorry. I'm used to dealing with buffoons like these two all the time. I'm not used to talking to other women so if I'm catty just let me know and I'll promise to try and be better.\" It was Chaosia's turn to laugh. \"No need. Mine and Mikhail's step mother practically wrote the book on catty and ill so you're perfectly fine. Don't go changing what's not wrong. So what brings you guys to my humble work abode?\" Mikhail smiled, happy that his sister wasn't going to freak about his friends dubious appearance or manners like his father and step mother would. \"Not much, just wanted to show Memphis and Sway where you worked and let 'em meet you. I'm getting ready to take 'em by and start opening up the apartment so we can move the little stuff today and tomorrow while you're at school, then the big shit on Saturday. Speaking of which, do I need to call the whole crew into help move? I mean, I've never been to your campus apartment so I have no idea of all the shit you've got-*SMACK* Hey! That hurt you brat!\" Chaosia, shrugged, smacking her brother's arm again. \"Don't curse so bloody much, you goober. Outside is fine, but I have to work here, ya know.\" He sullenly nodded, rubbing the red mark appearing on his arm. \"Jeez, I'm sorry. No need to get all abusive about it.\" She nodded, then shook her head at her brother. He was the biggest reason she was moving closer into the city. To be around the family that mattered. \"I actually have most of my apartment packed up and sequestered into boxes so no real problem there. If you'll wait a bit, I get off in like an hour and I can just go with you to the apartment, so you don't get lost again.\" He blushed as Memphis laughed and Sway just looked perplexed. Chaosia was kind enough to fill her in. \"The first time he goes anywhere that's not work related, he gets so lost that we have to talk him back block by block and street by street. After that, he could get there blindfolded, but the first time is always the worst.\" Sway, eyes gleaming with mirth, ribbed Mikhail. \"Oh, so the first time for you is always the worst? God, one night stands really do suck for you then\". Mikhail sputtered as the other two laughed as they were ushered out the door. The next hour flew by as Chaosia tidied up and folded inventory, then having to wait on a very spoiled woman who wanted to order another color in the vintage Chanel pumps along with the two pair she was purchasing. It was absolutely mind blowing to watch the woman pull a hissy fit because the shoes were not available via order anymore one moment, then pull out an American Express Black Card and proceed to purchase half of the store. As soon as the woman was gone, she pulled out her phone and texted Sphinx, hesitating before she hit the send button. He'd been working longer days at his job this week, meaning little to now contact save the occasional texting. Should she bother him with the boring details of her day while he probably elbow deep in some poor bastards stomach at the morgue? She shrugged, then adjusted the message and hit send anyway. She would just claim temporary insanity later if they texted. She was turning out the lights when she felt her phone buzz. She opened it, looking at the message icon. Probably just Mikhail yelling to hurry. The dead zone was just as bad. Miss u too. She smiled, reading the message again before closing the phone and heading out the door, locking it behind her. Mikhail and Memphis were standing there, propped against a very beautiful 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500. Chaosia smiled as she walked over to her brother and looked at the car appraisingly. \"So, you're following me, then?\" They nodded, Sway stepping out of the car and coming to stand beside her. \"I'm with you, that way if they get lost then I can atleast be somewhere inside.\" Chaosia smiled, motioning for the older woman to follow her. As they got closer to her car, she noticed Sway stop and just look from her to the SS. \"Wow . . . You drive this beast? Mikhail said you drove a classic but I figured it was something like a Corvette or maybe an import.\" Chaosia laughed as she let Sway in the car, reaching to turn the radio down as she brought the engine roaring to life. \"Nope. The only Corvette I'd even think of touching in the 1967 Chevrolet Stingray Big Block. And that is all thanks to the engine. I just love Chevelles and older muscle cars. They have this, presence to them, ya know?\" Sway nodded, eyeing the girl as she plugged her iPod into the cigarette port. She was nothing like Mikhail had told them to expect. Sure, she was a bit shy and awkward around people but she seemed like a generally sweet kid with a good head on her shoulders. She didn't really seem to need the constant care Mikhail thought he had to give her. But then again, neither did Kip. But when Memphis wasn't there, the kid proved that he needed his brother's steady, grounding influence even if he did resent it at times. Suddenly, War's Lowrider filled the car as Chaosia pulled out an into traffic, waiting just long enough to let Mikhail see her then she was gone. Sway watched the girl, nodding her head to the beat and speed shifting as she rounded corners quickly and made her way through downtown towards the University. Suddenly, as they passed the college, she reached out and turned the volume down, digging her phone out of her bag. She looked at the number and smiled before answering and talking animatedly. \"Hello? Hey, what's up? Oh! Are you home?\" Sway, for the life of her, couldn't hear the other person on the phone, so she looked at the caller id on the faceplate. It seemed very familiar but was hard to read upside down and at an angle. She about to turn her head to read it when Chaosia's voice caught her attention again. \"Really? Oh, well if you have to help your friend then that's fine. I understand, really. No, help them, you've known them longer and I just kind of popped in so its really no big deal . . . And I just realized that I'm talking way to much for the amount of conversation on this call, so just decide and let me know. If you want to, you can just come see the apartment after we've done the moving. And before you do or don't say anything, I kind of felt bad with you being subjected to my brother's paranoia anyway, so that will work better. Yes, I'm sure. Okay. Miss You. Bye.\" Sway looked at the girl, eyebrow raised as she digested this information. So Mikhail's little sister had something or someone in her life she was trying to keep under her brother's radar. Chaosia turned into the apartment complex and killed the engine, looking to Sway as she asked, \"So, boyfriend?\" Chaosia blushed crimson as she shook her head. \"No just a friend. A new friend, actually. But my brother always sees males as a potential threat to scare away and I kind of want to keep this one. He's supposed to help someone else Saturday so that actually worked in my favor . . .\" Sway nodded, \"Because you want him to be a boyfriend one day, right?\" Chaosia nodded, blushing even darker as they got out of the car. \"Maybe. I just don't think it'll work that way, so I'm trying not to get my hopes up.\" As they entered the building and got on the elevator, Sway asked, \"Well why the hell not? He gay or something?\" Chaosia erupted into a fit of giggles, then collected herself. \"No,\" she said wiping her eyes, \"He's just older with a degree and a steady job and a steady life. I mean, I still have years of school left for my MFA and I'm, well . . . I'm not exactly winning any beauty contests here, ya know.\" She opened the door to the apartment, Sway following as she finally saw some of the fragility that Mikhail protected so desperately. She couldn't understand why she would feel like she wasn't pretty enough. She was petite with a solid, toned build that still managed to scream feminine. Her hair was an almost living mass of chocolate and caramel curls that fell to just past her shoulder blades and gave her this wild, eccentric feel while her eyes were the prettiest blue green that Sway had ever seen. The almost looked like sea glass rimmed with thick, dark lashes set against porcelain skin. The huge glasses she wore didn't really detract from her appearance, it just added something different to it. She turned, looking at Sway oddly, almost if she knew the other woman was evaluating her before smiling and shedding her jacket. She and Sway sat, talking about the crew and Memphis until, twenty minutes later, there was a knock on the door. In came Mikhail and Memphis, the latter looking more than a little upset with the former. \"How in the hell did you get lost following someone?\" Mikhail just sniffed, looking around the apartment indignantly. \"Well, she was driving like a bat out of hell. I'll let you follow her next time, Grandma.\" Chaosia laughed, then started loading the goofs with boxes to carry to the cars. She could have sworn she heard Memphis say, \"There's no way Eleanor can hold all of this.\" Sway laughed as she shook her head. Chaosia looked at her new friend. \"Who is Eleanor?\" Sway was cackling, eyes watering when Chaosia's phone went off again. She looked, seeing the text. It was from Sphinx. Tell me what time to be there Saturday and I'll help until afternoon, then go and help the others. After we can go get coffee. I'll bring an extra shirt. She grinned, then groaned, causing Sway to get up and look at the phone. \"What?\" She looked up at Sway from the floor. \"He's going to come help and meet Mikhail until he absolutely has to go to the other.\" Sway smirked. \"Awww. That's so sweet.\" \"No, probably just payback for his stupid coat I ruined. I told him I'd buy him a new one!\" Sway stopped, looking at the girl with shock before recovering. This was too good to be true. \"Coat?\" Chaosia nodded, not noticing the decidedly mischievous tint Sway's eyes had taken as she sat and started with more pointed question about the man in question. \"Yeah. I dumped coffee on him at the Starbucks close to the new apartment. It's how we met. We've been out once since then because I'm so hectic with work and he's got so much to do, but we text or talk . . . well, I talk and he listens, a few times a day. Why?\" \"Oh, that's weird. What's his name?\" Chaosia slumped her shoulders, looking at Sway with some suspicion. \"Sphinx.\" Sway shrugged, deciding then and there to devote all of her power to keeping this from the others. Sphinx had helped her out more than a few times in Memphis's absence and had even come back into everything to help them help Kip with Calitri when he had more to loose than most of the others if they were caught. The man's business was his own and if the sweet little thing sitting beside her could make him talk and actually act human then so be it. As long as neither got hurt then there was nothing wrong. Even the age difference didn't bother her. Hell, Memphis was four years her senior anyway, so she'd be a hypocrite to say anything against it. \"Well, don't worry everything will work out. Trust me.\" Chaosia nodded, then texted Sphinx back. Maybe it would be okay. Now where the hell was her brother and what was he doing with those boxes?[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Okay. In answer to a question I was asked in class, the story of how Atley and Sphinx met is NOT mine. That wonderful creation belongs solely to the talented Spike Daft in Silence on the Line (It's a great fic and you should read it if you have time). Other than that, I am aware I'm taking some liberties and if they don't add up just drop me a note or review and let me know so I can fix it. And here is chapter four. DISCLAIMER : I OWN NOTHING BUT THE OCCASSIONAL ORIGINAL CHARACTER AND ONE VERY OLD CHEVELLE SS THAT'S GOING TO EAT ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME IN GAS. By the time Thursday rolled around, Sphinx was sure he was going to strangle Memphis's lover. Sway kept throwing him these odd looks and asking him weird questions about how his relationship was going. She was worse than fucking Atley or Tumbler with this stuff. Honestly, Otto and Donny had been the best about it by not really saying anything at all. Memphis and Toby were falling somewhere in the middle range, right under Kip and Mirror Man. Surprisingly, it was Mikhail who had come to his rescue the night after the McLaren boost when Chaos called at the pier. She had thought someone was trying to break in and couldn't get in touch with her brother, so she called him. The others had shot to life, wanting to speak to the girl then trying their damnedest to eaves drop while he quietly told her to calm down and check the locks. Mikhail had practically bitten Mirror and Tumbler's heads off, telling them to grow the fuck up while he kept trying to get in touch with his sister. The source of said noise turned out to be her cat and a frat party down the hall getting out of hand, causing her to flounder and stutter over the line a she apologized profusely before finally consenting to calling her brother back and going to stay with him. She had, however, in her sleep and adrenaline fogged mind, slipped up and told him, \"I miss you and I hope you don't think I'm crazy for calling about this.\" He was certainly happier that she was moving away from the ruckus of campus life, though he still didn't know where. But the incident had made him realize two things. One: Mikhail was very quick to protect and defend those who he thought of as friends (and how he ended up on that short list, he had no clue), and two: Chaos was definitely worming her way under his skin quicker than he thought possible. While he and Atley were driving back, Atley actually had to drive the Chevelle for fear that he would blow another motor. When he'd gotten the text from her saying she was on her way to her brother's, he'd relaxed enough to actually function again. He was seriously considering helping her move and then backing off for a few days if not weeks. He was getting in over his head and comfort level here and what bothered him was how little it actually bothered him. \"You looked ready to kill, Sphinx. Is she okay?\" He'd nodded and keyed in the garage code, motioning Atley to go on as he went to make his way upstairs. He knew he'd have to give Atley a detailed account on Friday night, though he didn't relish the thought. They had already decided he would stay there in his flat so they would be ready to move first thing, seeing how Atley had volunteered to help Chaos as well. Which worked well for him as in he wouldn't be the only one breaking his back on Saturday. He'd already heard from Chaos, as she read her furniture lists aloud, that she had about twenty heavy and ten medium weighted pieces of furniture. Her bed sounded the worst, seeing it was a solid mahogany queen sized canopy . . . . She'd sent him a picture of it on his phone when he'd asked what her heaviest piece of furniture was. And, God how he wished he'd just left it alone. Even in the picture, the damn thing was enough to make his back ache. He would definitely have no problem putting her brother and Atley to work. And then he had to leave her apartment and go help Mikhail's sister move. Maybe, if he was really lucky, the younger idiots would get the heavy lifting done there and all he'd have to do is set boxes and push chairs. He wasn't holding his breath though. Today, however, he was off and he wasn't going to lament his soon-to-be-dead back or the drama that was sure to happen in two days. Not only did he have to meet Chaosia's brother, but he had to meet Mikhail's half-sister, Ripley. From what he'd heard from Memphis, the girl was okay, but weird. And she'd driven faster than he or Mikhail could keep up with, even in Eleanor. Sway had been strangely mute on the subject of Mikhail's mystery sister, only telling Kip and Tumbler that, \"She's very pretty in a weird way. But she's really sweet. You guys are going to have to be nice, though. You may spook her if you're not careful.\" He shook his head, clearing his thoughts as he stood and stretched. Glancing at the clock on his night stand, he lumbered into the bathroom to take a shower. It was already 10:30 AM and he was due to meet Chaos for lunch at noon. He yawned as he started the water and threw a towel on the vanity, deep in thought as he completed his morning routine. She was taking him to eat then they were going to see her new apartment and the one she was moving from, so he would know how to get there. He'd thought it odd that she'd want to actually take him to both. But after hearing about how directionally challenged her brother is, he'd relented pretty easily, especially for him. He was rinsing his hair clear of shampoo when he heard the phone start to go off. The theme for The Dead Zone was blaring in his apartment, making him groan and shake his head. Chaosia had taken to calling his work \"the dead zone\" in their texting conversations and when she talked to him at night, so when she'd gotten hold of his phone at their last coffee date, she'd downloaded the ringtone and set it for his work number, laughing as she did so. He'd wanted to say no and to stop her, but he figured he could indulge her in that. It wasn't like she asked for a ringtone of her own (though she had one) or anything. She'd just thought it was too good an opportunity to pass up. He got out of the shower, glaring at the phone and its voicemail icon as he toweled off. After putting on boxers and pants, he listened to the voicemail. Thankfully, it was just one of the idiots saying that he needed to remember to bring in any back paperwork he was working on tomorrow and they weren't calling him in. He deleted the message before tossing the phone on his bed on his way to the closet. He grabbed a heather grey shirt and a brown belt, forgoing the usual suspenders just this once. Chaos had joked that she didn't think he owned a belt. Well, he'd prove he did before banishing the damned thing back into the depths of his closet. He was pulling on his boots when he heard her ringtone going off. He glanced at the clock, brow raised. It was only 11:25 AM. There was no way she was out of class this early . . . . He opened the phone. \"Sphinx? Can you meet me at the University in like twenty minutes? My stupid professor is taking forever to look over these pieces for my final and I'm afraid we won't make it in time if you don't meet me here.\" He grinned. She didn't know he had the day off. She thought they were doing this on his lunch break, so of course she would be freaking out now. \"Sure, luv.\" She sighed, relieved. \"Great, meet me outside the Fine Arts and Drama Building, it's the first one after the Auditorium before the soccer field.\" He cringed as she said soccer . She loved the game and even played as a center forward during the season, but she still called it soccer. He would have to break her of that habit one day. It was damn football, not soccer . \"See you then.\" He finished getting ready and grabbed his keys and the beige member's only jacket from the coat rack by the door. His poor pea coat hung beside it, still in desperate need of dry-cleaning, but he hadn't mentioned it to Chaos and even avoided the subject entirely. He would eventually let her send it to be cleaned but not until he felt like it. She was spastic enough without having something to fret about, so no need pulling up the coat. As he walked out the door and flicked off the lights, he could only wonder where they were eating. They'd only had coffee until today and he had no idea what the girl ate. He could only pray she wasn't a vegetarian or some tree hugging loon that only ate tofu . . . whatever happened; this was definitely going to be an informational experience to say the least. Chaosia was walking out of the building as he pulled up; her messenger bag slung over her should while she lugged this huge tote with her. He shook his head. The art bag was bigger than she was, and cleaner. She was covered in black and grey smudges, her glasses pushed up in her hair to keep her bangs out of her face. Her paint and charcoal covered jeans were torn at the knees and being held up by a black leather belt with a huge red topaz belt buckle. Her red track jacket was zipped up to almost her chin, only showing some of her neck and the red cord choker she wore. She smiled, waving as she made her way to her own Chevelle and threw her bags in the front seat with her other supplies and books. After fighting the art bag to stay in the car, she started to strip off her track jacket. Sphinx stared, shocked as she shrugged out of the red material and bared a white tank top to the world. The tank top itself wasn't as shocking as the fact that she didn't seem fazed by the public de-clothing and what it was partially covering. Over her left should and disappearing under the shirt down her side was a huge sienna toned tattoo of something, what he couldn't quite tell. As she pulled out a black tee-shirt to put over the tank, he noticed the shiny white scars over her upper left arm. He was going to have to find out what happened there. When she turned back to face him, he almost laughed out loud. She always found the oddest and most random tee shirts and jackets to wear. She was wearing a \"U.S. Antarctic Outpost 31 American Research Station\" tee shirt from one of her favorite movies (or so he'd discovered as she gushed over it while they talked and she'd watched) The Thing . He shook his head as she ran around the front of the car, almost tripping on her shoe laces, and jumped in the passenger seat. She looked at him expectantly until, begrudgingly, he put on his seat belt, grumbling as he buckled the damn death harness. She nodded, before she started spouting out directions to the restaurant she was taking him to. Fifteen minutes later, they were pulling into the Arts District. Chaos pointed to the place and he had to do a double take. There had to be a mistake. He looked at her out of the corner of his eye. Was she serious? The place, with a neon sign dubbing it The Penguin*, was a hole-in-the-wall dive if he ever saw one. And it was packed. She wanted to eat here? She tensed, seeing his reaction. \"Is this okay? I mean, it might not look like much, but they have the best food in all of Long Beach. We can go somewhere else if you want. . . \" He shrugged, killing the engine and getting out, leaving her to follow suit. As they walked in, he realized that the entire crew would feel comfortable here if not damn right at home. The walls were lined with classic car and beer memorabilia while a jukebox played Johnny Cash in the corner. The waiters and cooks were all covered in tattoos and piercings, but still seemed to appear friendly and open instead of menacing. The clientele surprised him the most, though. People in suits and scrubs sat elbow to elbow with students and the walking tattoo boards, all laughing and fine with the fact that so many different groups were together. He nodded once, surprised and pleased with her choice. The music was so loud that conversation was impossible, therefore not expected. She led him to a corner booth, waving at someone behind the bar who came to take their drink orders. \"I'm done with class for the day, so do you mind if I drink? I mean, I know you can't since you have to go back to work . . .\" \"I'm off the rest of the day, luv. Do whatever.\" He shrugged, pointing to the Miller High Life on the beer list the waiter was showing him. He was going to have one, she might as well too. When the waiter came back, however, he was surprised again. She was drinking Guinness. She laughed at his look before tapping her bottle neck to his and taking a long draught from her beer. She then showed him what she was going to get on the menu and what was good. When the waiter came back, she pointed out both of their orders, asking for two more beers as they killed the first ones. He raised a brow. \"Don't worry, since you're off we can be here long to make this little bit okay. Besides, my apartment is like two blocks from here so we can walk if you want to.\" He shrugged again, draining his beer and taking the new one. Chaosia was proving to be full of surprises. When their food came, he had to marvel at what she'd gotten him; a huge burger with three patties and enough fries to feed an army. He looked at her plate, perplexed. She had two hotdogs smothered in chili and onions, normal enough. But what on earth were those green things beside the hotdogs? \"They're fried pickles. My first roommate was from Georgia and she loved them. Eventually, I tried them and dipped in ranch, they're actually pretty good. We came here once a week to eat this before she graduated last semester. Want to try one?\" He gave her a look that clearly said everything he refused to, causing her to laugh as she ate her weird treat. Over lunch, he listened as she talked about class and her portfolio as Muse and The Sex Pistols replaced Johnny on the juke. He would nod when he thought he should but otherwise, he didn't have to talk. All in all, even with the loud music and rowdy crowd that had filled in at about 12:30, it was probably the most relaxing thing he had done all week, including driving the boosted McLaren. When it was time to leave, he dropped the cash for the bill, surprised at how inexpensive the outing had turned out to be. When they were outside, however, Chaosia made a fuss over him paying for lunch, leaving him slightly perturbed and more than slightly perplexed. Finally, he had to ask \"What was that about, then?\" She rolled her eyes as they walked to the car, muttering about men being oblivious at any age. \" I asked you to lunch, Sphinx. Meaning it was supposed to be my treat. I don't want you to pay for anything unless it's your idea to do it, and even then I want the option of going Dutch. It makes me feel like a shallow little airhead when a guy is always paying for everything, and you've paid for most of our coffee and suffered the loss of your poor coat.\" He stopped at the front of the Malibu, not believing what he'd heard. Surely she wasn't upset because he'd paid for their lunch. It had to be something else . . . Hell, even Sway liked for Memphis to pay for everything; she'd voiced that particular detail to Kip during one of their relationship crisis. \" It makes a girl feel special that a guy wants to take care of them, even in the little ways,\" is exactly how she'd put it when she'd been lecturing all of them (but mainly Memphis and Kip). \"Are you serious ?\" She looked at him, brow raised. Then she took on this look of extreme enlightenment that blossomed into a cross between respect and something else. She came to stand beside him, looking up at him as she put her hands in her pockets. \"You're used to someone wanting to have a free ride, aren't you? Well, I don't. I think relationships of any kind, friendship or romantic, should be as equal give and take as they can be. Does that bother you?\" He looked at her, the turned and looked over his shoulder at the car. He would never admit it aloud, but she'd just managed the impossible. She'd made him uncomfortable. Finally, she just smiled and shook her head. \"I don't do anything normal, Sphinx. I'm weird and opinionated and difficult. But I also want to be fair, to me and to you. And that means speaking up when I don't feel comfortable. I would say I want you to do the same, but I have a feeling that actions speak louder than words for you, right?\" She stopped, looking down at her feet, the shrugged and flipped her hair her shoulder and smirked. \"Let's try this, if we go somewhere you want to go, I'll pay for it. And if we go somewhere I want to go, you can get it. That way it's at least semi-equal and we're both equally to blame, regardless of if it goes well or awry. Deal?\" He nodded, looking skyward as she smiled and, in her new found good mood, totally missed the fact that she was standing next to a parking block and tripped when she went to walk. He barely caught her before she toppled. She laughed nervously, blushing profusely as she straightened herself. \"Okay. To my apartment before I kill myself in the parking lot or die of embarrassment. And don't you dare laugh, Buster.\" When they got her campus apartment, Sphinx had to admit she was right. She didn't do anything normal or even remotely close to it. But he was still amazed at the level of organization Chaos had put into her packing. Each room was packed into about ten boxes of varying sizes and grouped together and labeled to insure they would be easier to move, load and unpack. She even had a damn list for each room of what was supposed to be there and what could be moved if there wasn't enough room. And under that list was a series of three sketches. The first a floor plan showing furniture arrangement and storage options while the second and third showed where pictures, mirrors and accessories would be placed and what went where in what part of the room**. He shook his head, putting her lists and sketches down. The only things still up were some of her ink paintings and the massive monster bed in the bedroom. He was deliberately avoiding that one. As he looked at the inked pictures, he had to admit, Chaosia was good. He was looking a dripping seascape when she came back out of her bedroom, having changed into clean jeans and replaced her converses with flip-flops. She smirked, asking, \"So, what do you think? Do I have enough boxes to last 'till Doomsday or what? \" He gave a deadpan look before he noticed the big black tomcat that was winding its way around his legs, purring loudly. He scooped the heavy tom up, scratching under its chin as it meowed and purred. \"You like cats? Well, with a name like Sphinx, I guess you would kind of have to . . . \" He glared at her and the unhidden mirth in her voice as she crossed the room and liberated her cat from him, the tom practically boneless the second she touched it. He whined as she sat him down, then stretched up her leg to be held again. Sphinx had never seen a cat do that. Dogs yes, but never a cat. \"Oh, I swear, Cat. You're a cat not a puppy. I should have never let Mikhail keep you with that damned malamute of his. You're ruined for good now.\" Sphinx stopped, turning to look at her. \"Mikhail? Who is Mikhail, then?\" Chaosia, moving around the cat to go feed him, answered over her shoulder. \"My brother, well half-brother. But I really don't see why he insists on making the distinction. But he's always been a little weird anyway, so . . . Why?\" Sphinx looked at her, suddenly knowing why Sway had looked so smug while everyone else had been in the dark. Of course the only female of their rag-tag crew would piece the whole debacle together days before the rest of them, and keep it to herself for a laugh. He was going to wring her neck when he saw her. \"Sphinx, are you okay? You look about ready to kill something.\" He turned and looked at her, and suddenly the resemblance between the siblings jumped out at him. The same nose and hair color, though his was straight while Chaos's had a life of its own. The same pale skin and almost identical body language when they were relaxed. Apart, without prior knowledge, they could pass as perfect strangers . . . but when you knew to look, the similarities were mind boggling. How in the hell hadn't he noticed? \"Your brother works with Otto Halliwell, right? Tall chap with dark hair and a love of Corvettes?\" She nodded, eyeing him like he'd grown a second head. \"Yeah . . . Why? Do you know him? Mikhail doesn't owe you money or anything does he?\" Sphinx snorted. Oh this was great. The first bloody woman to ever just let him have some peace without trying to force conversation and all the other emotional nonsense, and she just had to be related to a member of Kip's crew. \"Yeah, I know him. Otto and I go back. We may have a problem.\" She stopped moving completely, giving him a look that would make Atley's blood freeze. God, she must practice that one, because there is no way a sweet little thing like her could manage such a black look on her own. \"What problem? You know my brother, big deal. If he has a problem with who I talk to, it's his own. I don't tell him not to date crack whore and airheads, like it would do any good anyway. So he can't tell me who I can and can't be friends with. Why do all men act like talking to another guy's sister is blasphemy? Is it against the Man Code of Ethics or something?\" He watched as she started to pace, ranting as she went. The cat, now seated on the kitchen counter, tracked her progress along with Sphinx. If she hadn't been so mad, he would have been tempted to use a rare word in his vocabulary: cute. She was so damned cute mad it was almost sickening. As it was, he was fighting the urge to goad her to see what she'd looked like pissed. He was spending way too much time in Mirror Man's company. \"Steady, girlie. If it's not a problem for you, it's fine. Just breathe. It's not like your brother's going to try and kill me or anything for taking his sister to lunch.\" She stopped, and it seemed like all of the anger and gusto just fled her system as she gave him a deadpan look. \"You're kidding, right? The last guy who took me to lunch got a broken nose and fractured collarbone for his trouble. All because he 'groped my ass' and Mikhail and one of his friends just happened to be there to witness it. Happened my ass, they were spying. Mikhail is going to freak, especially since you know each other. Wait, do you know Sway and Memphis, too?\" He nodded, sitting down on the sofa as she groaned and flopped down beside him, her head in his lap. He chuckled darkly. At least she wasn't pacing anymore. \"Oh, God! Just go ahead and kill me now. I swear if she opens her mouth, I'll hurt her. I'll have Paul scalp her when we go to the spa tomorrow I swear I will.\" Sphinx raised a brow as she rolled to look at him, her cheeks almost purple they were so red. She laughed nervously, running a hand over her forehead as she explained. \"I kind of told Sway that we were talking and she started asking all of these questions . . . I should have known something was up but I was so tired from work and class, I didn't catch it. We're supposed to go to a spa with one of my friends tomorrow after I get out of class. God, this is going to be so weird! I know Khail wanted me to get to know his friends, but I doubt that this is what he had in mind.\" Sphinx shook his head, laying a massive hand on her forehead, pushing her hair back out of her face. She sighed, moving to get up. As she sat up, she shifted to get off the couch . . . . And her flip flop slipped and sent her toppling right into his lap, knocking their heads together. As she lifted her head from where it had collided with his, she swore she saw stars. He had this look of annoyance and astonishment. He didn't need to say anything; she knew exactly what he was thinking. \"No, Mr. Sphinx. I cannot get up off my own couch without tripping and falling. So there! At least I didn't have coffee.\" He looked skyward again as she chuckled and buried her face in her hands, never bothering to move from his lap. When she looked back up, her face doing a marvelous tomato impression, she shook her head and laid it on his chest. \"Lord, just give me one day where my feet don't try and kill me. I swear I'll never deliberately hit Coach in the head with another soccer ball until the beginning of next season.\" Sphinx set her back, one hand on her shoulder giving a quick squeeze before he stood and she squeaked, gripping her arms around him as she tried not to fall, again. Her face, buried in his neck, had gone from red to white. He sighed, loud and heavy as she realized he wasn't dumping her in the floor. He had her and was waiting to put her down so they could go see the other apartment. She blushed as she looked up at him, smiling weakly. \"Sorry. Guess I'm going to have to get used to no warning, aren't I?\" With a roll of his eyes, he eased her to the ground, trying not to notice how she slid down him or how she was looking up at him. Before he let her go, she did the most brazen thing, shocking him out of his normal silence. She stood on her tip toes and kissed the corner of his lips, turning to go gather a charcoalless coat. As she scuttled down the hall, he stood there stunned. When she came back, the look on his face screamed \"What the bloody hell was that about?\" She shrugged, and noticed her shoulders had sagged a bit. Oh hell, how had he hurt her feelings? He'd have to do something to-wait, why would he do anything? \"I wanted to, you know, kind of say thank you for you sitting through your first Chaos rant session without wringing my neck or something. I don't know . . . just don't worry about it, okay? Let's forget it happened and just go look at my new place.\" As she went to walk by him, he made a split second decision that, later that weekend when he was lying in bed, would baffle hell out of him. He caught her arm and spun her, carefully, to face him. As she looked up, perplexed, her caught her lips with his own. When she didn't respond at first, he was sure he'd scared her to death and almost pulled back. But when she melted into him and her arms went around his neck, he knew, for a moment anyway, that whatever would happen because of this kiss would definitely be worth it. She whimpered as they parted for air, causing him to dip his head and kiss her again, though this time it was just a ghosting of his lips over hers. He stepped back, smirking at her kiss swollen lips and overall puzzled appearance. If he ever wanted to shut her up, he'd definitely found the most enjoyable way. He smirked evilly, causing her to blush darker as she shrugged into her coat. He opened the door, holding it for her as she practically shot passed him. She was still speechless on the elevator and on the walk to the car. Finally, as he cranked the engine to the Malibu, he turned to see if she was okay. She turned, noticing his look, and smiled. Not the small smirks or the grins he was getting used to, but an honest to God smile that would have taken a lesser man's breath away. \"So, uh . . . on to the new apartment, right?\" As he pulled into traffic, he noticed she was starting to recover, chatting more and more. Finally, as they pulled into his building's parking garage, he realized that he had covered her hand with his when he wasn't shifting, rubbing it as she talked. He groaned mentally as they got out and made it to the lift. This is going to be his downfall, he just knew it. In a few months, he would be worse off than Memphis . Waiting on the girl hand and foot, begging her not to leave when she got in her moods. Apparently, his sour turn of thinking showed because Chaosia smacked his shoulder. Hard. He turned and looked at her, amazed she had hit him and that it had actually kind of stung. She was giving him the weirdest look, too. When the doors opened, she walked out, calling over her shoulder. \"Earth to Sphinx! Are you in there? What's got you looking like you're getting ready to pull a three state killing spree, honey? Lamenting the loss of your macho manly stuff already?\" He glared as he followed her to her new door, then had to notice it wasn't brown or navy like all of the other doors on this floor. It was a bright coral with the numbers on a small oval bronze plaque under a bronze door knocker that was shaped like a piece of coral. She smirked at the look. \"Oh, come on. I'm buying this apartment, Sphinx. I wasn't going to just leave the door shit brown if I didn't have to. Besides, I paid the extra deposit to paint.\" When she opened the door, he momentarily forgot what he was going to ask her. Though they would be living in the same damn building and had the same exact layout for their respective apartments, he was at a loss. This did not look like it belonged in their building. She had redone the walls in the living room a taupe gray, and had had the carpet pulled up in favor of the hardwood floors. The kitchen was painted a darker taupe with stark white cabinets and coral hardware. She had put a shell mosaic back splash over the coordinating granite counters. The laundry room off the side was open, allowing him to see the new washer and dryer as well as all of the baskets and storage shelves she'd already installed. He turned to look at her, brow raised. How had she afforded this on a student and sales clerk income? She shrugged. \"You've been busy with work and I have a certain brother who owed me about two hundred hours of hard labor in return for distracting a rather gross guy a few years ago. Come on, I'll show you what I had done to the bathrooms.\" As she showed him her new home, he had to admit that she was pretty insightful and thrifty. She'd had new tile and dresser styled vanities put in both bathrooms, and had both painted a similar shade of neutral gray, though the master was darker than the guest bathroom. One of the bedrooms was painted the same dark taupe with the exception of one wall done in charcoal chalkboard paint with taupe designs swirled throughout. Her master bedroom was painted a light neutral gray and the other bedroom was only slightly darker. Finally, after she'd shown him everything, she walked out on her patio and fire escape. She turned, pointing up the steps. \"Do you know who lives up there? Mikhail said that it was one of his friends, but that I probably wouldn't see much of him. I was actually warned that he liked his privacy. Khail said he was actually surprised when it was mentioned that this unit was for sale.\" Sphinx smirked, holding out an arm for her to go up the escape. He followed her until she was standing in front of his patio doors. When he produced a key, she groused. \"We are so going to hear it from Mikhail for this. He is going to shit his heart after he has kittens.\" She walked in, and was pleasantly surprised. His charcoal gray leather L shaped sectional sofa was nestled against the longest wall in his living room, the short side actually forming a kind of break from the main door. The huge black coffee table was littered with several piles of paperwork he'd brought home to finish. The TV and entertainment center were in the same place in his apartment as they were going to be in hers, though his big screen was considerably larger, causing her to chuckle and shake her head, muttering, \"Boys and their toys\". She stopped long enough to peruse his movie collection, nodding when she saw something she liked or recognized. She then made her way down the hallway, stopping to see the black and charcoal bathroom before looking in the room that had been allocated to be an office and catch-all room. The black armchair in the far corner had a grey flannel blanket thrown over the matching ottoman, though both were covered with more paperwork and files. His black desk was in the same state, though the small car parts being used as paperweights here and there made Chaos raise a brow at him. \"Is it a guy thing to try and use every part of a car in your house or just a boost thing?\" He glared at her, causing her to giggle and shake her head at him before continuing down the hall to his bedroom. She took one look at the California King bed, decked in black jersey sheets and a heavy grey comforter and started to giggle again. Before he could top her, she was laughing as she jumped on the bad, looking around the room with mirth dancing in her eyes. He had painted the entire apartment a medium taupe color, similar to her own color palette, making the black and gray pop out, though she seriously doubted that had been done on purpose. He seemed to have as much interest in design and decorating as Mikhail did. His furniture was all well used but cared for, just like hers. It was the flat screen TV nestled on the dresser that had her giggling like a mad woman. He watched TV in bed. It just seemed so weird and normal, especially for him , but it was a cute fact to learn at the same time. The bad sunk in beside her and she was literally flopped on her side, looking up at him as he looked down at her. She smiled, \"I like your home, Mr. Sphinx. Very manly.\" He shook his head, kicking off his shoes and stretching out beside her, head propped on his arm as he gave a her a deadpan look. She nodded, starting to talk again only to end up squeaking as he pulled her to him with his free arm. She looked up at him, puzzled before he lowered his lips and kissed her forehead, then pressed his own against hers. She sighed, running her cheek along his. \"This is nice. Its peaceful and quiet, just like you.\" He raised his brow again, causing her to laugh and snuggle into his chest. \"Okay, so you're not always peaceful, but you do seem to keep the peace around you . . . well, unless I'm around.\" He shrugged, watching as she reached for the remote beside the bed. He raised a brow as she looked at him with this evil glint to her eye. \"My movies are in those boxes downstairs. I could always go get a few and we could watch TV for a while before we go back to get my car.\" He leaned back against the pillows, hands locked behind his head. After a few minutes, he decided that a movie or two would be fine. It was only a little after 3, so they could relax a bit. Finally, he shrugged and she was gone, back down to her new apartment. A few minutes later, she returned with an armload of movies, spreading them out for him to help pick. What amazed him was that none of them were girlie titles. They were mostly something that he had either seen or had wanted to see, though a few had him puzzled. Seems the sweet little thing had a penchant for foreign and independent films, as well as horror. Finally, after an intense one sided argument on the cinematic value of Prophecy (which he was not buying the least. Seriously, a movie about mutant bears had cinematic value? To her maybe . . .) they settled on The Thing, which caused him to roll his eyes. She couldn't believe he'd never seen it and he still couldn't believe that she loved horror movies so bloody much. As the open titles rolled, she stacked the DVDs beside the TV then settled back in beside him on the bed, laying her head on his chest as they watched. About half way through the movie, he noticed she wasn't talking or commenting anymore and looked down. She was asleep, snuggled as close to him as she could be without laying on him. He sighed, looking upward. Now what was he supposed to do? He was aware of the fact that his own eyes were drooping, when he pulled the comforter over them. Maybe a nap wouldn't be so bad. Hell, he couldn't remember the last time he'd actually taken one . . . Sphinx shook himself awake. He didn't need a bloody nap. He would let her sleep until the movie was done and then he would wake her up so they could go get her car. She could go home and sleep and he could get ready to go to work tomorrow. Then they would move her Saturday and he could just carry her home after that. As he watched Kurt Russell bake the imitator's walking spider alien head, he started to doze. Okay, so fifteen minutes wouldn't hurt . . . Chaosia was vaguely aware of the fact that she wasn't in her own bed. This one was too hard and there weren't enough blankets for it to be hers. She opened her eyes, only to be greeted by a semi-dark room and the main menu for The Thing DVD playing on the TV. She sighed, nuzzling back into the warm chest she'd been sleeping on . . . And her eyes shot open. She looked and there, sprawled out beside her and snoring soundly (and loudly) was Sphinx. His arm was wrapped around her shoulders and she was spread out across his chest. She stopped, trying to remember what they had been doing before they conked out. She'd put on a movie and they were going to watch it. And then she didn't remember anything. She groaned and laid her head back down on his chest, listening to his heartbeat. She was almost back to sleep when he rolled, almost squishing her in the process. When he settled on his side, she was crushed to his chest and held there by two large arms. Inside, she was cackling. Who would ever know that someone as fearsome and terrorizing as Sphinx was turning out to be (for other people anyway) would like to cuddle in his sleep? Well, no one was going to learn about it from her that was for damned sure. Even though they were on the cusp of some weird semi-relationship, she wasn't dumb enough to believe that he wouldn't hold a grudge over her exposing what he was sure to see as a weakness. Especially since she was piecing together just which one of her brother's friends he was. Mikhail would probably die if he knew that the man that had scared him shitless when he first started working with Memphis and Kip all those years ago was currently a centimeter away from spooning. She sighed and settled back in to go to sleep, idly wondering what time it was. It was dark outside so it was well after 7:00 pm . . . Oh well, might as well sleep while I can. NOTES: * This is actually based off a restaurant like fifteen minutes from my university and I couldn't help but work it in when a friend mentioned it would be funny to see someone like Sphinx in that kind of setting. And yes, they do serve Fried Pickles and Ranch. Never had them but they are supposed to be good . . . ** This is how my interior design roommate moved her entire apartment when we moved into a larger apartment after our first freshman year. Unfortunately, she had me draw and organize everything so . . . yeah. Thanks for the reviews and the tips. Hope you enjoyed Chapter Four. On to Chapter Five . . .[Chapter 5] My Brother, My Keeper There was a damned buzzing noise coming from somewhere in the general area of his head and Sphinx was definitely not please with it. He groaned and swatted at whatever was making the noise, hearing something clatter to the floor and slide. He grumbled, rolling over and wrapping his arm back around the warm body beside him before the damned buzzing started again. He opened his eyes, groggy and very unhappy at this turn of events. And he had been sleeping so well before . . . He looked down and felt his brain creep to a halt. There, lying in bed next to him was Chaosia. She was curled into his chest and had an arm draped over his side while one of legs was securely trapped between hers. Her glasses were nowhere to be found, leaving him to hope she'd taken them off and that they hadn't been crushed. Her hair, now a tangled mass of curls and ringlets, was spread across his pillows, taking up more of the other one than her actual head. He blinked, trying to remember what exactly, if anything had happened. They were both dressed so that was a plus, especially after the discovery of who her brother was earlier. Speaking of earlier. . . He turned to see the clock and had to double check it. It said 7:45 AM but there was no way that that was right. Oh sure the sun was out and the birds were chirping, but they couldn't have slept for over fifteen hours. Besides, he was supposed to be at work at 6:30 so . . . He turned and looked for the buzzing thing on the floor and cringed when he saw it was his cell phone. It started to buzz again, showing the number for work. When had he set it for vibrate? He opened the phone and listened as his supervisor started talking. Thankfully, the old man was almost completely deaf without his hearing aids so he rarely had much trouble with Sphinx not talking. Most days, nods and looks spoke volumes with the man. Today, however, he was showcasing the senility that had taken him to the morgue from the ER by asking odd questions. \"Mr. Sphinx? Are you okay? If you're alright, let me know. Press a button.\" He groaned, shaking his head but hit the button anyway as he settled back into bed. He couldn't believe he was late. He'd never been late or missed a day of work. Ever . He always made sure he was punctual for work and boosts (and it wasn't his fault if the other boosts thought he should work around their time schedules). \"Okay. I'm assuming something has come up and you haven't had time to inform us that you'll need a sick day yet, right?\" He pressed another button, thanking God for the idiots he worked with. Only they would think him being late would mean he wasn't coming in at all. Btu then again, that's the way it was with most of the others so maybe it was just common courtesy. \"Well, that's fine. You have enough banked vacation time that we can swing today. Send an email if you need more time next week. Hope you get to feeling better.\" And with that the line was dead. He groaned, turning to go back to sleep. At least he had another day off and had probably spooked two of the other workers. He smirked. He would have to remember to 'appear' behind Richards and Norman Monday to make up for not being able to torture them today. He still owed the two blighters for eaves dropping earlier in the week anyway. He was almost asleep when he heard another buzzing. He looked at his phone and growled when he saw it was blank. Chaosia turned and groaned, grumbling about stupid phones as she dug the cellular out of her pocket in her sleep. She opened the phone, amazing Sphinx as she carried on a half decent conversation for an unconscious person. \"Hello? What? No, I'm fine. Yes, Paul, I know the car is in the lot and I'm not. Take notes for me. No, I'm not dying.\" She growled, rolling over and burying her head into his chest, oblivious to the fact that she was doing it. \"No I didn't go get laid, either. Yeah, well that's just your opinion, Paul. No, I don't want to hear about how great Orsino's butt looked at soccer tryouts yesterday. Because, that's why. I'm going back to sleep now, Paul. Call and wake me up to go to the spa. No I'll come back and get the car later. No, don't drive it. No not even to another parking place. Good bye, Paul.\" She hung up the phone, chunking it on the pillow behind hers as she grumbled about stupid boys and their car obsessions. He wanted to let her sleep but he couldn't help the question that spilled from his lips. \"So who's Paul? We just started sleeping together and you've already got another one on the side?\" Chaosia shot up; looking at him wild eyed before she gathered her wits and smacked him with his own pillow. He chuckled darkly as they settled back down and he flipped the cable on, trying to find something to watch. \"Ha, ha. Paul is my best friend and would definitely be more interested in sleeping with you than me. He was worried because the car was there but I wasn't. What time is it?\" He looked over at the clock. \"It's almost 9 o'clock.\" She groaned and snuggled deeper into his chest. \"Do we have to get up? Can't we just stay in bed all day and watch Jerry Springer or something?\" He shook his head, moving so he could stand. As he made his way to the bathroom, he heard her get up and head to the kitchen. \"I've got some clothes downstairs so I'm going to change. If you want to we can go get breakfast. My treat.\" He nodded as he made his way into the shower. He hadn't slept that long or that hard in years. And while he was stiff from being trapped under Chaosia most of the night, he wasn't sore or sluggish like over six hours usually brought. He actually felt good. He was getting out as Chaos came in the bathroom. They stared at each other for a second before she let out an *EEP* and shot back out, closing the door. \"SORRY! I am so sorry! God, I have got to learn to knock!\" He was laughing when he opened the door, dressed in clean boxers with the towel draped over his shoulders. He was pulling jeans and tee shirt from his closet when he felt her trace the tattoo over his left shoulder. \"Wow. Is this why they call you Sphinx? It's beautiful . . .\" He looked back, seeing the big, black sphinx tattoo in the mirror as well as the other on his legs and upper right arm. He shrugged, pulling the tee shirt over his head as he turned to look at her. She smiled, standing on her tip toes and kissed his bottom lip lightly as she wrapped her arms around his neck. \"Good morning, Mr. Sphinx. Sleep well?\" His face morphed into a dark grin as he swooped her up and tossed her on the bed. He pulled on his jeans and lay down beside her. She'd changed into a pair of dark skinny jeans and a simple white button-up oxford shirt with a crest on the left breast. She'd traded her normal converses and flip-flops for brown leather riding boots that came to her calves. Her hair was pulled into a low ponytail with huge curls hanging around her face, which he was currently tucking behind her ear. She blushed as he leaned down and gave her a smoldering kiss. As they parted, she kissed his bottom lip again and down to his chin. \"If that's how you say good morning then I am definitely going to stop by before classes every day.\" He shook his head at her goofiness. He wasn't sure what they were or where this was going, but it was comfortable and he actually enjoyed the company of another person rather than resenting it. But then again, her brother was one of the few he could say he actually didn't mind being around that much, for very different reasons mind you. But both of the siblings had this laid back attitude and acceptance of a person's nature no matter the flaws. Mikhail had never pressured him to talk or to listen; he just let him be and was fine with the acknowledgment he received. Chaosia, on the other hand, seemed to find every trait that made person odd or unique and wanted to embrace it full-heartedly, if for no other reason than she could. They sat and just enjoyed the peace and quiet until her phone went off again. She reached for it, grimacing when she saw the number and answered it. \"Hello, Mikhail. Yes, I know I'm not at my apartment, goober. Yes I am aware that my car is parked at the school. Paul called you? Well, Paul is a drama queen and a half so don't you worry-What? I'm with a friend. No, it's not-yes it's a guy. No, it isn't any of your-what the hell does that mean, 'do you know him?' Yeah, Mikhail. You do know him, you're just not going to-\" She growled into the phone, finally frustrated enough to start cursing. \"Look, damn it. I stayed the night with a friend. NO, NOT THAT KIND OF STAYED THE NIGHT, YOU JACKASS! Yes you know him and yes you can meet him. Eventually. Saturday, if he wants to. No, I won't tell him he has to come meet you at the garage today. Because it's rude. Look, Big Brother , you're being a jackass. I may be younger than you but I'm a big girl, Mikhail. And I'm fine. You know what, ask Sway. She's probably dying to tell you anyway. I'm hanging up now.\" She groaned and threw the phone up to the top of the bed, looking at Sphinx as he tried not to chuckle. \"Want to go eat and then go beat the shit out my brother for me?\" He shook his head, standing and popping his back then offered her his hand. She took it and he pulled her up and into him, leading them to the door. She collected her coat and he grabbed his, hurrying her before she could notice the pea coat. He was going to have to find a place for that thing other than the coat rack if she was going to be in and out. As they started to the lift, his phone started to buzz. He looked down, amazed at the number on it. He opened the cellular and waited for the surprise caller to speak. \"Sphinx? If Chaosia is with you then put her on now. Her brother is ranting like crazy because I won't tell him anything.\" He sighed and handed Chaos the phone so she could talk to Sway. As they got off the lift, he made their way to the car, ensuring she didn't trip. He was going to have to go settle this mess before it got out of hand and he had to kill Mikhail for disturbing his peace and daily routine. There went breakfast. Chaosia, oblivious to what was going on around them as they drove, chatted with Sway, who had apparently refused to tell anyone, even Memphis any detail she knew. She had claimed it was none of their damned business so they should just leave it alone and had locked herself in Otto's office with Donnie and Atley. She was, as they pulled up to the garage, threatening to never come out if they didn't leave her and Chaosia alone about the whole bloody thing. \"Tell her we're here and to come out of the bloody office. It'll be handled.\" Chaosia sighed, telling Sway what Sphinx said as the older woman jabbered about Sphinx actually talking to her. Chaos just rolled her eyes. \"You really don't talk to them much, do you?\" He shrugged, opening the car door and coming around to open hers. He made sure she was blocked form view as they walked into the paint dock. Otto, who was as bewildered as the rest of the younger crew, just shook his head and came to fill Sphinx in. \"He's upset because Sway knows something and won't tell him. Memphis, the poor soul, is stuck between them. He wants Sway to fess up because it has to do with Mikhail's sister and he would want to know about Kip. But he doesn't want her to if she doesn't want to because forcing Sway goes oh so well. Kip is siding with Sway, because he thinks they're all over reacting while Tumbler and Atley are neutral. Donnie is just pretty much refereeing while Mirror, Toby and Freb have no clue what's going on.\" The older boost turned and noticed Chaosia for the first time. He was startled at her presence but he smiled at her anyway. She smiled back, waving as Sphinx moved to keep her blocked from view. \"Well, hello there, darling. I'm Otto Halliwell and welcome to my little shop of horrors and soap opera practice. What can I do for you?\" Chaosia giggled, extending her hand to Otto to shake as she introduced herself. \"I'm Chaosia Guadimus; it's nice to meet you Otto. And I hope I'm here to do something for you. You see the big idiot over there screaming like a banshee at a closed door is my half-brother. I just hope Sphinx can calm him down without maiming him.\" Sphinx snorted as he shed his coat and started towards the group, calling over his shoulder, \"Not bloody likely, luv. He's foaming at the mouth.\" Otto looked at her, awed. \"You know Sphinx?\" She blushed. \"Yeah, I'm getting to. We've only been talking about a week, though.\" Otto paled, suddenly connecting the dots. \"You're the girl who tried to scald him to death with coffee? The one he's been texting?\" She snorted, flipping her over her shoulder. \"I apologized.\" She looked at him, suddenly suspicious, \"And how do you know he's been texting me? He's not exactly the full disclosure type, you know.\" Otto grinned, \"Atley and Sway. Atley and Sphinx are probably the closest to being friends either of them will ever have while Sway just kind of notices everything. Plus, she helped teach him how to text on that new phone of his so . . .\" She nodded, suddenly very aware of the length of hell he'd gone through to ensure contact, if this fiasco was anything to judge by. These were the people who kept her brother on the straight and narrow? Atley, Sphinx and even Memphis or Otto she could see, but the others just looked like every other person Mikhail had ever associated with, especially after he started boosting. It wasn't that she cared what he did; she just didn't want him getting hurt. She sighed then turned to the sound of Mikhail squawking as Sphinx practically picked him up by his shirt and sat him on one of the backseats-turned-benches. She excused herself from Otto and walked over, hoping to keep her brother and her semi-boyfriend (yeah, that was a good title for it) from killing each other. She stopped right behind Sphinx as and put her hand on the arm he was using to keep Mikhail still. He stopped struggling when he saw her, his face going from pissed to shock as she walloped him in the head. Hard. \"What the hell is wrong with you, acting like that? Our mother is turning over in her grave, Mikhail Alexander Shaw. She raised you better than to act like a horse's ass!\" Sphinx looked at her then to her now totally subdued brother, aware that whatever was happening she could handle. He stepped back, just enough to give Mikhail room to slump in the seat. Chaosia, however, didn't move her hand. And the others noticed. Atley who had emerged from the office when the fighting stopped, looked at Chaosia with a slack jaw before shutting his mouth and coming to stand beside Sphinx. Sway and Donnie emerged to finish out the group, all curious to what was going on. Mikhail noticed the proximity of the stoic boost to his sister and the fact she was touching him and still had a hand and just started to snicker. Snickers turned to chuckles to full blown laughter as Chaosia stared at him like he was crazy. Finally, he caught his breath and wiped his eyes. This was too good to be true. \"So, is this the friend you were talking about, Ripley?\" She grimaced as he used her middle name. \"Why do you insist on calling me that? It makes me sound like a boy or something.\" He grinned, easing back into the seat. \"Or something. I've always called you Ripley, it's what Mom called you. And you still haven't answered the question.\" She blushed, then nodded. \"Yeah, Mikhail. It is. So what? Going to go on another idiot rampage?\" \"Nope, because I know it's nothing serious now. God, you had me worried. The way you sounded, I was sure it was going to be someone on your soccer team or in one of your classes that you were just shy of falling madly in love with. Had I known it was Sphinx I would have just left you alone. I mean, you've always sworn you would never ever date a boost so . . .\" She glared, smacking him in the back of the head again, causing a loud pop to echo through the paint dock. She was shaking her reddening hand when he clutched the side of his hand, shouting. \"Jesus, Chaosia Ripley Guadimus! Have you lost your mind? Are you trying to make me deaf?!\" \"NO! Just trying to knock sense into your damned thick skull. I told you I wouldn't date Frankie the Fish, Mikhail. Because he was a fucking jerk. A fucking jerk that you still owe me like a million favors for distracting all those years ago.\" \"Hey, I helped you paint and redo your new kitchen and your bathrooms! What else do you want?! A blood sacrifice? My first fucking born?\" She smacked him again, this time with the other hand on the other side of his head. Even Sphinx was amazed to see this side of her. Otto and Sway kept looking to Kip and Memphis with this look of nostalgia as they watched the two argue. It must be a sibling thing. He screeched and she kicked his shin with her boot hard enough to hear a crunch. \"Damn it, Chaos! Don't do that. You know you kick harder than most damn men!\" \"It's called soccer and exercise, dumbass. And what do you mean what else do I want?! Four bloody hours of listening to that, that WEASAL gloat about how smart and great he was so YOU could boost his target and get out of trouble with your boss. A few hours hard labor isn't worth the 240 minutes of my life that that idiot sucked away. You owe me whatever I want, be it car, animal, man or freaking diamond studded wheel bearings! Besides, what's wrong with me dating him, hm? You dated that thing from Tulsa for years and she wasn't even attractive!\" Sphinx stepped forward and put himself between the two, putting a steadying arm on her shoulder. \"Don't' smack him, luv. He still has to help you move tomorrow.\" And with those twelve words, all motion and noise stopped. Tumbler and Kip both stared as Atley shared a grin with Sway. Memphis was just relieved the fighting had stopped while Donnie sat beside Mikhail and threw an arm over the younger boost's shoulders. \"Hey, brother. It could be worse. She could be dating the smurf over there.\" \"Hey!\" Mirror Man jumped into action, defending his wardrobe and his height against the laughing group. Mikhail, sighed, nodding. \"I don't think my heart could take that. Besides, he doesn't talk much so they won't ever argue. That means no midnight phone calls about the evils of her boyfriend. Okay. I'm fine. Ass moment officially over. Let's just move forward and pretend I didn't do this.\" He turned and looked at Sphinx, was glaring at Kip and Tumbler as they introduced themselves. \"Sphinx. All I have to say is that if you hurt her, I'll break every bone in your body and throw you off a pier if it kills me. Got it?\" Sphinx chuckled darkly before nodding once to his younger compatriot. \"Sure, boy-o.\" Mikhail nodded, having accomplished his brotherly duty and still kept his acquaintance. He turned, grabbing Memphis as they made their way to the fridge and the beer, muttering about hard headed siblings the whole time.[Chapter 6] DISCLAIMER: I OWN NOTHING SAVE THE OCCASSIONAL ORIGINAL CHARACTER AND AN SS CHEVELLE THAT\"S EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME IN GAS! Spa Daze and Revelations Sway laughed at the look Tumbler and Kip were getting from Sphinx, though she doubted the stoic boost was even aware of the severity of his glare. Sure he knew he was glaring, but he probably didn't know that he was close to peeling the paint off of every car in Otto's paint dock. Chaosia, to her credit, just smiled indulgently at the two idiots as they tried to demonstrate their ability to juggle various tools from around the garage together. She nodded at each failed attempt, never laughing as they dropped wrenches and screwdrivers on their toes. She also never let go of Sphinx's hand, rubbing small circles with her thumb, though Sway (again) doubted that either were aware. Memphis had returned from the kitchen with Mikhail, both with beers in hand, and had shaken his head at his younger brother. \"If he gets annoyed with you two for trying to impress his girlfriend, I'm not even trying to stop him. Go sit down before you get yourselves mauled.\" Kip had paled and gone to sit while Tumbler had laughed and started talking to Mirror Man. Mirror, who had been unusually quiet about the new addition to the garage, was watching her with unconcealed interest. Finally, after Tumbler went to help Otto move an engine, Sway made her way to talking to their resident techno-wonder. \"What's up with you? You've been watching her since she came in.\" Mirror shrugged, turning to talk to Sway. Neither noticed that they had drawn Sphinx's attention as Chaosia walked away with her brother and Memphis, who were intent on introducing her to the other boosts and Junie. Junie, delighted to have another girl around, had ushered into the house and was currently chatting her ear off. \"She's just got this way about her, you know?\" Mirror said, looking the way Chaosia had just gone. \"I mean, it's not bad or anything. It's just weird. Who is she that she can walk in here and just tell Sphinx the Homicidal Maniac, who throws snakes out of cars and rams police cars over parking embankments, to stop and he does? I guess I'm just in shock. And did you hear how hard she hit Mikhail? God, it made my own hand hurt . . . and she just kept on like she was determined to not let anything stop her from making that point. I mean, Mikhail talks about her like she's made of glass and is gonna break at any minute. I'm just not seeing it.\" Sway nodded, lighting a cigarette as she looked to the house door. Mirror had a point. The girl was definitely not all that they'd been told she was. But then again . . . \"What all has Mikhail told you guys about her? I mean, he and Memphis are getting kind of close but he was a member of your crew before. Surely you know something about their family we don't.\" Mirror nodded, shifting his weight from one foot to another. Sway smirked; it was his nervous trait to fidget, just like Tumbler and Kip. \"Yeah, I know some. Their mom is dead, from cancer if I remember right. Mikhail said that his sister took it real hard when she was diagnosed. Even passed up an opportunity to go to some big league East Coast school so she could stay here and help take care of their mom. When she passed away, she didn't handle it like he thought.\" Sway nodded, taking a drag. \"Fell apart?\" Mirror shook his head. \"No. See that was it. She was pre-med before that, and was working in a hospital, doing clerical or something, when their mom passed. According to Mikhail, Chaosia cried a little then made all of the arrangements, because her dad was too torn up to do it. He ended up moving out of the states and Chaosia switched colleges and majors, taking up Art. Every time he says something about her maybe going back to her Doctorate, she just laughs and blows it off.\" Sway looked at him like he was crazy, then it clicked. Mirror couldn't see how she could just switch her life around when her mom died, but she could. She'd gone into boosting after her father had died, vowing to live the life she wanted since he couldn't. She could understand how something like that could affect a person mentally and emotionally. \"It's her decision. Besides, Mikhail is her brother. He doesn't want her to be a starving artist if she doesn't have to be. He would want her to have the high paying job. It means security. But you guys need to realize, it's what makes her happiest that she has to live for. Plus, I stayed with her while Mikhail and Memphis were lost and toting boxes. She's pretty cool. And speaking of cool, I think I have to go liberate her from Junie so we can make our spa date.\" Mirror stopped, looking at Sway like she'd grown another head. \"Spa? You? At a spa? Doing what?\" Sway shrugged. \"She and her friend were already going and she invited me to go. I have no idea what we'll do, but I imagine it'll be all girlie and prissy.\" Tumbler and Kip, who had heard Mirror squawking about the spa, had joined them just as Sphinx emerged from the shadows to go get Chaosia. He was shaking his head at the trio's interrogation of Sway when Chaosia came flying out of the house and plowed right into him, almost sending both of them to the ground. He looked down at her hurried expression and knew she'd looked at her watch. \"Where is Sway? We have to go! And I still have to go get my car before-\"He put his hand over her mouth to stop the fountain of jabber. She stopped, took a breath and continued at a human tempo. \"If we don't go now, we're going to be late.\" Sphinx nodded, handing her his keys then stepped aside so she could get Sway. Chaosia, however, seemed to be playing dense as to what he meant because she just kept staring at him like he was crazy. Finally, he held out his hand and explained. \"Give me your keys and your brother and I will go get your car. You and Sway can take mine. Just don't kill her.\" Chaosia stared; amazed as Mikhail and Memphis walked up behind her, sure they didn't hear what they'd walked into. \"You're going to let me drive the Malibu? For real? Just like that? No macho tests or arm length list of rules and decorum?\" He glowered at her, making Memphis take a step back and Mikhail take a step up, ready to defend his sister if he had to. Chaosia, on the other hand, lept into action doing the worst thing for his reputation and one of the best things for his ego. She jumped up and wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him square on the lips before digging her keys out of her pockets and, after apparently deciding one kiss wasn't enough to stroke her gaping brother and his friends out, proceeded to kiss him again. This time, however she made sure to leave him wanting. He knew he was wearing this dazed look as she pulled back and practically beamed at him. \"Thank you, Sphinx! I promise I won't kill your Baby Blue . Just meet me and Sway back at the new apartment around four. See you then. Bye!\" And with that, she was gone, dragging Sway into the Malibu with her and pealing out of the parking lot. Mikhail, who remarkably was the first to recover, just clapped the larger man on the back and shook his head. The others all held their breaths as Sphinx turned to look down at the younger boost. \"Dude, you're in for a world of hurt and don't even realize it yet. You'd better be glad she's got such a good heart or she would eat you alive. Come on, let's get you a beer.\" Sphinx, still dazed, asked, \"And why the bloody hell would I need a beer?\" Memphis nodded, smirking as the rest filed back into the paint dock to break out the High Life. \"Because, man. We just sent that sweet little girl off with Sway for five hours to a spa. She's going to need a drink if I know my girlfriend right. Who else was going with them?\" \"Paul was supposed to meet them . . .\" Mikhail was cackling as he handed Sphinx a cold Miller, already opened. \"Dude, you're dead. Paul is going to Spanish Inquisition her to death and Sway is probably going to be arrested for assaulting a masseuse. Welcome to life with Chaosia, brother .\" Sphinx groaned, downing half the beer as the others started talking, thankfully about everything but his newly acquired love life. Chaosia was insane. That was all Sway could think as she weaved in and out of traffic, doing well over the allotted limit, speed shifting like a mad woman. Sway couldn't even see her touching the clutch, just shifted every time she heard the right sound from the engine. The girl would make a wonderful boost or race car driver, but as it was Sway was just praying they would make it to the spa breathing. When they pulled up to the brick and mortar building, Sway felt her heart start to slow down just a bit. They had made it and in one piece! Chaosia pulled into a spot and killed the engine, smirking as she heard the car settle. Sway knew that look; it was one she wore every time she saw an Italian. That look was pure, unadulterated love. Maybe the girl was going to be okay within their rag-tag family, after all. Chaosia smiled at her, blushing as they got out of the car and locked the doors. \"I swear he drives worse than that. I'm sure that I left my spare heart somewhere near the Penguin yesterday.\" Sway raised a brow. \"The Penguin?\" Chaosia nodded, laughing. \"Yeah, The Penguin. It's the restaurant we ate lunch at yesterday. If you could have seen his face when we pulled up, you would have died. He almost didn't go in, I'm sure. But he liked it. Actually, that's where Paul will probably want to eat so you can experience it yourself.\" Sway nodded, suddenly curios. \"Sphinx let you come to the spa with a guy?\" Chaos nodded, holding the door for Sway as they entered the lobby. The place was huge and painted white. Actually, every single thing, save the vast assortment of orchids and lilies, was white. Even the rocks and sand in the huge zen garden. Sway suddenly felt very out of place in her green cargo shorts and her black Ferrari tee shirt. She almost took a step back but the friendliest voice pulled her and Chaosia's attention to an open doorway. \"Oh my God, Chaosia! You made it! And with a friend, too. Nice. So, this way.\" \"Hi, Paul. This is Sway, Sway this is Paul. Don't worry, he's just prissy.\" He sniffed, looking at Chaosia's hair and then to Sway's. \"You need to be a little prissier, Missy. And it's nice to meet you, Sway. Here, go change.\" The man, with blond spiked hair and tanned skin, was dressed in white dress paints and a tight white polo with the spa logo on the chest. He even had on a white leather bracelet and white leather shoes. His blues eyes danced with mirth and a million secrets as he ushered the two of them back and into the salon portion of the spa. He handed both of them white yoga pants and tank tops and white terry cloth robes. Chaosia, used to the man and his methods, just accepted the clothes and went to change while Sway looked after her, confused. Paul, sensing her dilemma, took pity. \"Let me guess, first timer? Don't worry. I just give Chaosia a facial and make her get a deep tissue massage before I cut her hair and style it. Lot of good it does me. It'll stay beautiful until she washes it then back to the curly mass of hell it goes. Go on and change, hon, you'll be fine. We don't bite.\" Sway nodded, going and changing. When she got back, Chaosia was already seated and Paul was telling her he was waxing her eyebrows, like it or not. She, on the other hand, was adamantly refusing. \"My eyebrows are fine. They are shaped and groomed. Besides, the time I let you talk me into waxing anything I regretted it.\" He smirked at her brazenly as he waggled his eyebrows at Sway in the mirror. Sway, interested in this discussion, sat in the empty chair beside the arguing friends. \"Oh, but your boyfriend loved it, didn't he? I mean, that was a work of art, if I do say so myself. And with that tan and those highlights . . . you were fit to be had, my dear. Speaking of boyfriends . . . Why weren't you in life drawing today, Missy? You'd better not be getting any when I'm not or I'd be jealous, heartbroken and thrilled. Spill!\" Sway laughed, as Chaosia blushed and glared at her friend. \"Oh, so you skipped class to come settle everything? Wow, I just thought Sphinx took out of work but man, both of you . . . that is dedication.\" Paul, sensing an ally, turned to Sway. \"You know this mystery man she refuses to let me meet? Dish! I want all of the gory details starting with the How, as in how does he look.\" Chaosia groaned and pulled out her phone, texting Sphinx. This was a very bad idea. Sphinx, while trying to figure out why Tumbler and Kip thought it funny to repeatedly try and rush Donny (who just kept landing them on their asses), felt his phone buzz. Looking down, he opened the cell and smirked at the message. It seemed Chaos was having a worse time of it than Memphis and Mikhail had predicted. At least her car would be waiting on her when she got done. Please never let me put Sway and Paul together again. Ever. Shoot me if I even suggest it. They're trying to get me to cut my hair and dye it again. Help! Miss u He chuckled, sending a text back. She was going to need more than just a drink when they got to the apartment if they kept trying to get her to change her hair. He grimaced at that thought. He liked her hair, especially when she'd let it down and free. He opened his phone back up, dialing Sway's cell. She answered on the third ring, laughing. \"Hello?\" He growled, suddenly angry that he was about to do this but determined to keep Chaosia the way he liked her. Unless she wants to change her hair, then she can do whatever she wants . . . \"Do not cut, shear or dye her hair anyway but how she wants it.\" And with that, he hung up. Memphis, having overheard, was laughing as he handed Sphinx a piece of the pizza they'd ordered. Sphinx had always respected Memphis and today that respect was elevating a few levels. The leader of their crew had officially decreed that Sphinx's life was his own and the only person allowed to ask anything was Mikhail and that was in privacy. Of course as soon as the others lost interest, he'd asked a few questions of his own while Atley had grinned like the Cheshire cat the whole while. Finally, Atley's gloating got the best of Mikhail, who asked, \"What, Atley? What has you so damn smug?\" He'd just grinned and shrugged. \"Nothing. I just knew that the pretty little thing in the coffee shop was going to worm her way in, even if it took a while. She was smitten from day one, Mikhail. She practically drooled when he took of his coat.\" Mikhail had raised a brow, interested for the details now that he knew it involved Ripley. \"Really?\" Atley had nodded, leaning in. \"Oh, yeah. And then she gave him her number after he never said two words to her. Girl had guts.\" Mikhail nodded, laughing. \"That sounds like Ripley. I swear she's never been afraid of anything. I had to keep her from getting bitten by a snake when we were kids because she was so damn nosey she didn't register that the rattling noise might not be good thing. She just wanted to know where it was coming from. And the way she drives. Lord, Sphinx is brave to trust her with the Malibu that's for sure. She'll never drive my car unless she absolutely has to.\" Memphis nodded, \"yeah, I couldn't even keep up with her. Mikhail had to drive to even try and find her place. Girl would make a hell of a boost. Speaking of boosts , what was she talking about earlier with Frankie the Fish?\" Mikhail groaned, shaking his head. \"Man, I was young and working for Big Eddie doing some boosts that he couldn't trust Frankie with. Well, Frankie caught wind of it and boosted the car Big Eddie had sent me after for spite and was driving it to the bar to show it off, right? I had Ripley with me and we were going to talk to Big Eddie when she sees the car in the lot and pulls in.\" Memphis and Atley stopped laughing, amazed. \"She knows you're a boost? As in, she's okay with the fact you steal cars every now and then?\" Mikhail nodded, taking another swig. \"She's always known what I did and while she doesn't always like it, she does support me with it. I mean, it's kind of in our blood to go outside of the law so she doesn't freak. Anyway, Frankie come out of the bar, drunk as a skunk and sees my car. He walks over and, taps on the window, starting to yell at the car.\" Atley looked, as well as Sphinx. \"And?\" \"And, Ripley was driving, since she'd promised not to kill us. She tells me to get the car and go to Eddie before she hops out and asked him what his problem was. I went around the back and got to the mark . . . boosted the damn thing right under his nose while he talked to her, stumbling and almost fell into her. I took it to Eddie and he sent me back in a POS Honda for Frankie to drive. Problem was, when I got there, Frankie was practically down on one knee, begging Ripley to marry him. She just kept telling him no and to leave her the hell alone or she was going to hit him again. When I got closer, I saw she'd already busted his lip and blacked one of his eyes when he got pawsy. Apparently, that really did it for him and he knew that Ripley was the one for him.\" Sphinx shook his head as the others laughed. Memphis, after catching his breath, asked \"So what happened?\" Mikhail grimaced, taking a long draught from his beer. \"When he sobered up, Eddie had words with Frankie about trying to underhand me. I thought everything was settled until he started calling Ripley. She knew Little Ed pretty well when they were younger and when Frankie asked about the girl who helped me out, Ed but it together that it had to be Ripley. He even gave Frankie her old cell number.\" The other three stopped, confused. \"Why the hell would he do that?\" Mikhail shrugged. \"Frankie was good at the bullshit, you know? He swore to Little Ed that all he wanted to do was apologize to Ripley for being such a prick. And he did apologize. About seventy times a day. He even started sending flowers to her house and to her school. Finally she told him to leave her alone or she would black his other eye and he told her that she was going to marry him one day. Ripley laughed and swore she'd never date a boost, telling him she was dating another Pre-Med student. It was a bluff but it worked. He quit calling and, after her tires got sliced, she didn't have any more trouble out of him. Big Eddie got word of the whole ordeal and felt bad. He even paid to have her car fixed and detailed and handed her a nice lump sum for the months of harassment she endured. Frankie went missing shortly after that. I heard he relocated to Florida to outrun some debts of his.\" Sphinx and Atley shared a look as Memphis asked the question they were all thinking. \"Why would Eddie do that? He wasn't exactly known for his good heart and kindness. The man had blood colder than antifreeze.\" Mikhail smirked. \"Our mom and Eddie's wife went back. They were like distant cousins and best friends. So when Mom married Ripley's pop and had her, Eddie was wrapped around her little fingers from day one. All he had was boys, you know? And Rip was the first girl in Mom's family since she was born. All Ripley had to do was point and she got it when were younger. It's why he waved your debts for me, Memphis. He was practically family, before he passed away. Little Eddie and I don't get along well, but he and Ripley were tight until after Mom died. They just kind of lost touch, though.\" Memphis looked at Mikhail, suddenly wary. \"So why did you leave Eddie's if he was so good to you and your sister?\" Mikhail blushed, sitting his beer down and running a hand through his hair. \"I wanted to get away from it. I mean, I love to boost and Eddie always took care of me. But when Calitri came in, Eddie and his boys had to start doing stuff out in the eye of the other parts of the gang they'd always left private. Don't get me wrong, Memphis. Eddie was a good man when he wasn't in the business . . . but when he was at work; he was one of the biggest monsters I've ever seen. After Mom died, Ripley switched schools and moved out to the university area, so I didn't have to worry about her that much. But when Eddie got sick, I knew it would be a power struggle. And even though it hasn't been two years since he died, I knew that if I stuck around with it me or Ripley would get sucked in deeper.\" He sighed. \"She's my family, Memphis. I don't want to see her in with that. She's always been real good at skimming the surface of unpleasant things and still coming out clean. Eddie made sure she was never too involved or knew too much. Little Ed isn't his father though. I don't doubt that he would use either of us in any way he could. Besides, Kip and Tumbler saved my ass and offered me a place to crash. When I told Ripley, she told me to take it as a sign and get the hell out. She told Eddie I was leaving, and ensured that everything would be kosher if I ever wanted to go back.\" Atley nodded, agreeing. \"I can understand, man. Believe me. Working for Calitri was probably the single worst decision of my life. But I had to do something or my own debts were going to eat me alive. So, who wants another beer?\" Memphis and Mikhail both cheered while Sphinx nodded. He looked at Mikhail, actually kind of proud that the boy had some feel for family. He was taking a drink of his third, no fourth-or was it fifth beer when the phone went off, blaring Chaosia's ringtone. Memphis had laughed while Mikhail just shook his head, smacking their fearless leader. \"Don't laugh, Memphis. Sway's ringtone isn't any better.\" Memphis, suddenly intent to defend his absent lover's honor, asked, \"And what is wrong with Sway's ringtone? She picked it out!\" Mikhail, to his credit, gave Memphis a deadpan look while Atley chuckled and drank more beer as Sphinx opened the phone. \"Lady Gaga's Poker Face is great for a girl, Memphis. But when it blasts from a guy's cell phone in the middle of the parts store, heads do turn.\" Memphis grumbled, \"Yeah, well if she's happy then I'm happy and a little closer to sane. What's your ringtone for your sister then?\" Mikhail smirked. \"Savior by Rise Against. We go see them every time they're close to here. Plus Ripley loves it and its manly enough that I'm not embarrassed if she calls while I'm at work or out.\" Atley was in the dark. \"What is her ringtone for Sphinx's phone then? I didn't hear anything wrong with it.\" Memphis cackled while Sphinx, who had been talking quietly to Chaosia the entire time, stopped to glare at their crew leader. There were days he seriously doubted the man's self-preservation instinct. Finally, the fact that he didn't know what song it was, only that it was by a girlie group made Memphis stop and look at Mikhail. \"Yeah, what song is it, oh knowledgeable?\" Mikhail shook his head, sighing as he explained. \"The song is actually Brick by Boring Brick by Paramore. She likes the group.\" Memphis, sensing an opportunity to aggravate the man, asked, \"Hey, Sphinx? Do you know what her ringtone is for you? It's probably sweet and sappy.\" Sphinx glared, then rolled his eyes and got up to go outside as he listened to Chaosia rant about her new hair. Paul and Sway had apparently not headed the warning as Chaosia swore her hair was now littered with blond, caramel and crimson highlights. He smirked as he heard Atley rise to his defense. \"What are you Raines, six? Do you want to read the noted they pass in class too?\" He turned his attention back to the phone call. \"Chaosia, I'm sure it's . . . . fine?\" She growled over the phone as Sway cackled. They were getting lunch with Paul and Chaos was being ragged for not sharing details. He could hear Paul wanting all sorts of tidbits and Sway screaming over the music to not share whatever she knew. \"I have to work with Sphinx. I do not want to know what he looks like without a shirt or pants, Paul. Leave that for when I'm not here, please.\" \"Do you hear it, Sphinx? Do you hear what I've been putting up with? Do me a favor and just shoot me when we get to the apartment.\" He shook his head. \"No, luv. No shooting. Just hurry up and meet us there. We're leaving soon.\" She sighed and said, \"Fine. I'll go and let you go back to glaring at Memphis and Mikhail. I'll see you in a few minutes. Miss you.\" He smirked. He was never going to get used to hearing that. But she always said it, no matter how long they talked. \"Miss you, too, Luv. See you soon.\" He turned to see Mikhail and Memphis Awww ing at him like idiots while Atley shook his head and went to round up the younger crew. Mikhail looked back at him, curious. \"We can go ahead and get boxes and start moving them today. That way tomorrow will only be furniture. Besides, if we go now we can get a load to her new apartment before she gets there and win our boy some brownie points.\" Mikhail nodded then paled and shot after Atley. \"Hey just because I'm okay with this doesn't mean I want him to get points ! Points lead up to something I'd rather not know my sister does, thank you!\" Memphis smirked and clapped Sphinx's shoulder again, and barely flinched at the look he got in result. \"Dude, I know we're ragging you and giving you hell, but we are happy for you. And I personally hope that everything works out okay. But if it doesn't, then it doesn't. Don't worry about all of the other crap and let what happens happen. Just enjoy the ride.\" Memphis regained his senses and said, \"Now that I've done my friendly duty, we'll just ignore that conversation and go save Donnie from Kip and Tumbler.\" Sphinx nodded, wondering what happened overnight to make his crew go crazy.[Chapter 7] Practical Moving By Atley Chaosia was amazed as they pulled into the parking complex of her new apartment complex. Most of the cars, including her own baby, from the garage were parked near the elevator and seemed to be stuffed with boxes. Sway raised a brow as Paul just chuckled. \"Oh, honey he is a keeper if he's already moving you. Does he have a less scary younger brother floating around somewhere?\" Chaos looked over her shoulder at her best friend and the constant thorn in her side. \"Why yes, Paul. He does. And wouldn't you know it he's gay with a taste for drama queens.\" Paul undeterred by Chaosia's sarcasm, clapped and shouted, \"Sign me up, darling.\" Sway laughed, opening the door to the Malibu after Chaos parked. She had to admit, the spa was nice and lunch had been interesting. Where Chaosia was a few years younger than her, Paul was closer to her age so the outing had actually been fun over all. Apparently, Paul knew Chaos well enough to hassle her into most things, her new hair being one of them. Chaosia's dark curls had been tamed into a softer, feminine style and layered with blonde, caramel and crimson highlights. The twenty minutes he'd forced both of them into the tanning bad had left her with a darkening tan, something that still amazed Sway. She was sure as pale as the girl had been that she was going to come out looking like a lobster. But amazingly, Chaos only had rosier cheeks while everything else had taken on this pretty, even tone almost three shades darker than before. Sway herself was a shade darker and had new blond highlights in her already platinum tresses. Paul had combed out her dreads and trimmed the dead ends, styling it parted to the side and pulled straight with the bangs popped back in a hump. He'd even texturized her hair that when she wore it curly, straight or in dreads, it would be easier to handle. The man had then ushered her off for a facial and make up, the latter something they'd almost have to sit on Chaos to accomplish. Paul had to threaten her car to get her sit still long enough for him to do her eye shadow and lipstick. Sway shook her head, looking at the girl was still glowering at her best friend as he chatted along ignoring her. Done up like this, Chaosia was gorgeous in a classic way, something that made Sway realize that for all the girl's protests earlier in the week, she really was a pretty little thing. Her multicolored tresses fell to her shoulders, loose and flowing around her as she walked. Her bangs had been trimmed and swept over the left side of her forehead, almost hiding one of her eyes. She looked at Sway and, noticing she was being watched, smiled and waved. The girl was apparently oblivious to everything but being stared at. As they got in the elevator, Paul asked, \"So what's the hunky dunky think of the new apartment? He like it?\" Chaos blushed, shrugging. \"I don't know, he lives in the one above me and it's not that different. A lot of black and charcoal though.\" Paul smirked. \"So what's the bed like, then?\" Chaosia smacked him just as the doors opened and he tried to run. He and Sway laughed as Ripley groused, \"None of your damn business, that's how the bed is. I swear, aren't you supposed to be on my side, here?\" Paul shrugged, smiling as she wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \"You're my friend and I am on your side. But honey, you know I'm always going to be on the side of hot, steamy sex first. And you know I'm kidding.\" She opened her apartment door, shaking her head. \"Yeah, well tone it down. He may not think you're funny. And I would hate to bury you so soon before you get up the nerve to ask out Andrew.\" The trio stopped dead in their tracks as they realized what they'd walked into. Sphinx and Atley were in the living room, putting together her entertainment center while Toby read off instructions, correcting them when they, well Atley messed up. Memphis could be heard arguing with Kip and Tumbler down the hall about where the boxes went. Donnie was in the kitchen, putting away dishes that were coming from the dishwasher and Freb was helping Mirror Man set up the stereo system near Atley and Sphinx, though he was more looking than helping. Chaosia, amazed, stepped back out and walked back in. The scene was still weird. \"Um, Sphinx? What are you guys doing?\" Atley jumped in, explaining that if they did this first then tomorrow wouldn't be bad while Sphinx just looked at her, sort of dazed. Chaosia just nodded as Atley chattered away, telling her how they could move all of the boxes and get them mostly unpacked. She still couldn't believe that they had done this. She was about to ask where Mikhail was when she noticed Sphinx just looking at her. She fidgeted and turned, telling Paul and Sway, \"Well, I guess we go to work then. I have sweats in one of those boxes so I'm going to change.\" Paul nodded, looking over the men in her apartment with something akin to a predator stalking prey. \"Oh sure, sure. Please do. That Ralph Lauren shirt would not benefit from heavy lifting and strenuous exercise. Besides, I think we can handle it long enough for you to change.\" Suddenly, he turned and looked at her, a stern glint to his eyes. \"And do not mess with your hair! It takes me hours to get it like that, so leave it alone.\" She grumbled as she headed down the hall. \"Hair Nazi.\" Paul, used to this title, retorted, \"Nein! Now leave it alone!\" Chaosia was hanging the white shirt on one of the hangers the group had brought when she caught movement out of the corner of her eye. She turned, noticing it was Sphinx. When had he even come in the bedroom? She blushed and put the shirt in the closet before folding the jeans and tossing them on the top shelf. Finally, she turned and looked at him. He'd changed from earlier as well, wearing a pair of dark denim pants that were cuffed at his ankles with a tight black tee shirt, topped off by those beloved suspenders of his. She smirked, shaking her head as she saw them. \"Why do love those things so much?\" He shrugged, crossing the room and coming to stand right in front of her, causing her to look around the room. Memphis and the Dynamic Duo (formerly known as Kip and Tumbler) had brought all of the boxes from her bedroom and master bathroom, including the huge tubberware bin that had her towels and shower curtain in it, all still with tags. She looked back up at him, blushing as she asked, \"Want to help me set up my master bathroom? It shouldn't take long.\" He nodded, leaning down while he pulled her to him. \"Sure, girlie. After I do this.\" And with that little warning, he proceeded to slam his lips against hers. How a man that rarely used his mouth was so damned good with it she'd never know, but Sphinx new his way around leaving a woman breathless when he chose to. As they parted, she looked up at the glint in his eyes and the cocky smirk he was wearing, knowing that he knew how damned good he was at it, too. \"That's for earlier.\" She looked puzzled until she remembered and blushed even darker. He chuckled darkly as he ran his thumb over her cheek, \"A little warm, luv?\" She snorted, rolling her eyes as she quipped. \"If you must know, I was forced into a tanning bed for almost half an hour. So everything is going to look a little warm until tonight.\" He quirked a brow, interested at hearing that tidbit of information. \" You tan? Figured a frail little thing like you would burn.\" She huffed as she informed him, \"I tan very well, thank you. Tomorrow, I'll be darker than Sway or Paul. If I went back two more times I'd look like I just stepped off of an island somewhere, according to my oh-so-loyal hair dresser. Who is dying to meet you, by the way.\" Sphinx shrugged again as he pulled her back into him, resting his forehead against hers. He ran his fingers through her hair, admiring the colors as he tucked her bangs behind her ear. It wasn't so bad . Actually with the tan and her eyes, it made her seem more . . . . real than the china doll he wanted to compare her to. Less fragile and likely to shatter if he handled her wrong. She seemed to pick up on his train of thought and ducked her head, peaking at him through her lashes. \"Do you like it? My hair, I mean.\" He nodded, kissing the top of her head before stepping away and heading into the bathroom to help hang the shower curtain and bamboo blinds. He would never admit it aloud, but Atley was a genius. On the ride here, he'd confided the real reason for pushing the moving of boxes. \"If there is nothing there but furniture, then why would she want to stay the night? She'll stay here or with you, either meaning more time for the two of you to spend together. Don't thank me; I already know I'm brilliant.\" Sphinx had growled and been insulted by the notion that Chaosia returning to her apartment would affect him in anyway. But now, seeing her all done up and looking so damned cute as she fought the box open, almost falling in the process, he couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to wake up with her again tomorrow. He groaned mentally as he watched her bend to unpack the shower hooks and the new shower head for her bathroom. He was going to have to live in cold showers for a while if he didn't get himself in check . Mikhail is being better than you thought he would, boy-o, but he'll turn quick if you jump in bed with his sister right off the bat. Besides, she doesn't seem the type to have a casual affair for the sake of having one. Take it easy or she'll be giving you the shiner next time. Suddenly, her phone went off and they both just looked at it. She looked confused while he just wondered who was calling. Everyone she knew was practically here. She turned and looked at him, \"Do you have your phone?\" He reached a hand into his pocket, coming up empty and growled. \"Memphis.\" Chaosia paled as he turned and stalked out of the room, literally tearing down the hall to find the eldest Raines brother. Chaosia, hot on his heels and very confused, just watched in amazement as Memphis caught sight of Sphinx and fled behind Sway and Mikhail. Mikhail, who was holding a box of vases and coral, looked at Memphis and asked, \"Good Lord, what have you done now?\" Kip and Tumbler, both laughing so hard they were crying, just shook their heads as Mirror Man told Mikhail, \"Memphis wanted to see what her ringtone for the big guy was, so he swiped his phone and dialed her up. Too bad they were together when he did it.\" Memphis, determined to have the last word, dialed the number again and everyone stopped and looked at her phone as the most prominent guitar rip from In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly filled the apartment. Mikhail was the first to snicker and then the laughter just erupted as Chaosia just looked at Sphinx. \"What? Did I miss something?\" Memphis pouted as he heard the phone, turning to Sway. \"I figured she'd have this girly song for his ringtone and what does she have? Iron freaking Butterfly. That's just so wrong . . .\" Chaos just looked at them while Mikhail laughed, all the while taking out his phone and dialing her number. All of the older boosts almost died as Lowrider filled the room. Paul, picking up on it, dialed her up next and a punk cover of Material Girl had even Sphinx chuckling. Chaos still looked confused as she asked Sphinx, \"What is going on? And why is everyone calling my damn phone?\" Atley, determined to stay in her good graces since she would ultimately be the deciding force behind how much time he spent with his best friend, clued her into Memphis's ordeal over the ringtones and how Sway had picked his for her. Chaosia just looked at Memphis and shook her head. \"All you had to do was ask. Besides, why would I pick some sappy song for him? I mean seriously, it would be like naming a Doberman fluffy.\" Sphinx glared at her as she crossed her arms, glaring right back at him. \"Oh, don't give me that look. You know it's true. You're about as sweet and cuddly as I am a Debutante.\" They stared at each other for a few intense moments before Paul jumped in-between them, arms splayed and screamed, \"Oh my God, Chaosia. What did you do to your hair?! I said don't' touch it!\" She grimaced, \"I didn't he did. Yell at him.\" Paul, not one for suicidal tendencies, just flipped the bang back in place and said, \"And loose an arm? I think not. It's your hair and your responsibility.\" She groaned as she punched him. \"Traitor.\" Paul nodded. \"Hey, I'm crazy not stupid, honey. That would be like coming between you and soccer or those white chocolate truffles you keep hiding from me.\" He draped his arm over her as he steered her into the kitchen, showing her where he wanted her to hang his coffee cup for their monthly horror movie pow-wows as the rest of the crew went back to unpacking. Sphinx watched as Chaosia just crossed her arms and hung her head at what Paul was asking, blatantly refusing to let him have a whole shelf for one cup. Four hours and twelve pizzas later, the latter courtesy of Memphis and Sway, the crew had dispersed save for Atley and Sphinx. Even Paul had run off at about seven, claiming to need plenty of beauty sleep for the big move. Chaosia had snorted and politely pointed out that it hadn't helped him yet, which resulted in her laughing while he pouted and vowed to never cut her hair again before hugging her and leaving. Now, as the he and Atley sat on the sofa in his apartment, Sphinx had to admit that having her here another night was going to be nice . Too bad I'm sleeping in the bloody den with Atley . . . He had, in an effort to be generous and a gentleman in front of her brother offered her his bed while he and Atley took up residence in the den. The sofa was a sectional and could be separated into two pieces big enough for both of them . . . he hoped. Chaos had blushed and accepted before bidding her brother farewell and retreating upstairs with him. As soon as they had pulled the sofa apart, she had asked if she could use his shower. And it was currently taking everything he had to watch the re-run of his bloody football game and not go down the hall and see what was taking her so long. Wales had scored another goal when she came sauntering down the hall, towel in hand. \"Where do I put this? There wasn't a hamper in the bathroom?\" Atley had stopped mid sip and Sphinx turned to answer her question before realizing why his partner was suddenly counting the number of dots on the ceiling. Chaos was dressed in a black lacy tank top that showed just how ample her cleavage was without baring it to the world and a pair of charcoal exercise shorts that had been rolled to sit on her hips. And though the shorts came to mid-thigh, they bared enough of her now tanned legs to make any straight man's mouth water. Her hair was down and around her shoulders and her glasses were curiously missing from her fresh scrubbed face. She smiled at him, allowing him to see the soft dusting of freckles that the UV exposure from earlier had brought out. \"Sphinx? Where do I put the towel?\" He got up, taking her into the laundry room and tossing the towel for her before he returned to den. He was determined to watch the game and not be disturbed, and she seemed fine with that as she pulled a huge text book and a highlighter from her messenger bag, heading back down the hall. Atley, gracing him with the infamous Jackson glare, called after her, \"Hey, Chaos! Where are you going?\" \"To study a little before I go to bed. I know you guys want to see the re-run of the game and I know who won so it's no big deal. Good night, guys. See you tomorrow.\" As soon as she closed the door to the bedroom, his bedroom, Atley turned on him and started. \"I can't believe you! That girl is probably heartbroken that you don't say three words to her because of a damn game. Go apologize or I swear I'll help Mikhail break your legs, you big oaf. She's only going to put up with so much, Sphinx. Don't screw it up when it's just starting.\" Sphinx glared, but rose to take his friend's advice when Chaos came back down the hall and walked into the kitchen. She got herself a glass of water and, after rinsing the glass and putting it in the dishwasher she'd insisted on unloading earlier, went to go back to the bedroom. As she stopped long enough to say goodnight to Atley again and stood on her tiptoes and kissed Sphinx's cheek, he saw her cheeks were moist. Bloody hell, she'd been crying . Screaming banshees and fighting hellcats he could handle, but crying? \"Good night, Mr. Sphinx. See you in the morning. Enjoy the game.\" And with that she was back down the hall, except this time, he was close behind her. He opened the door just in time to see her stripping out of the shorts to reveal lacy black boy shorts and toned, tan legs that went on forever. She turned, her glasses perched on her nose as she squeaked and fell onto the bed. \"Sphinx!? What are you doing? Is something wrong?\" He growled, crossing the room and cupping her face in his massive hands before he kissed her soundly. After they parted he breathed three words, \"I'm sorry, luv\" across her lips before kissing her again, this time softer. She looked at him like he was crazy. \"Um, okay? Thank you . . . But for what?\" He looked at her, amazed as he ran a thumb across her drying cheeks. \"You were crying.\" She looked at him and then started to snicker. His repentant (or as repentant as it got) face darkened as he glared at her, demanding an explanation. After a few seconds, she stopped and reached up, kissing him lightly on the lips. \" Silly bear . I wasn't crying. I took out my contacts. I slept in them yesterday and figured I needed to give my eyes a break. The saline makes my eyes water. You didn't hurt my feelings. How could you have? I just got out of the shower and came in here . . .\" He looked back at Atley's voice cheering on the team opposing Wales, which is usually who he pulled for out of spite. Understanding blossomed across her face as she giggled and kissed his cheek again. \"It doesn't hurt my feelings that you want to watch a game, Sphinx. I would usually be right there with you if I didn't already know the final score. And you know why? Because I love soccer, big guy. Almost as much as I love art and Mikhail loves to boost. And you are a grown ass man who had a routine long before I came into the picture; however it is that I fit. I do not expect you to change for me just like I hope you don't want me to change for you. We can adapt for each other, later , but right now this is too new to start making rules and huge life altering decisions. Trust me. If you hurt my feelings, I'll let you know. Okay? Now go watch your bloody game and tell Atley to eat crow when Wales kills them in the second half.\" With that said and another light kiss, she kicked him out of his own bedroom and he returned to his sofa. He barely registered the game, only noting that Wales did indeed kill the opposition in the final half. Atley, disheartened by the loss of an opportunity to aggravate Sphinx in one of the only small ways he cherished, rolled over and drifted to sleep. Leaving Sphinx to ponder just what he had done in his life to deserve the woman reading in his bed. She's probably an axe murder or something . . . yeah, that's gotta be it . . . At about three o'clock in the morning, Chaosia woke up to go to the bathroom and get another sip of water. As she passed the slumbering duo, she had to marvel at Atley. He was dead to the world with his head hanging off the sofa while he snored away. She shook her head, wondering how anyone could sleep like that. As she was coming back through the den to go to bed, she noticed Sphinx. He had changed into a pair of dark sleep pants and forgone a shirt, baring his toned chest and torso to the world. She could barely trace a multitude of fine scars across the expanse of skin, but it didn't detract from the impact of it. If anything, it spoke to the strength that he practically oozed in his everyday life and served as a reminder that he could live up to whatever decided to test him. What drew her attention, however, wasn't the naked chest or sofa rumpled hair, though both were interesting in their own way. It was the fact that his legs from the knee down was hanging off the edge of his portion of the split sectional. She sighed and walked over, nudging his shoulder. When he woke up, he looked at her, confused. \" Uh? What's wrong, girl?\" She rolled her eyes. Leave it to him to talk more half asleep than awake. \"Come on, big boy. You can share your bed with me.\" He grunted and rolled, ready to ignore her until she grabbed his hand and tried to pull him off the sofa. He chuckled and relented, allowing himself to be led down the hallway and into his room. She turned the covers back and pushed him in, covering him up before she crawled in the other side, muttering about how he expected to sleep hanging off the sofa like Atley the bat. He grunted, settling in as she burrowed herself under the covers. He noticed she'd brought one of her fluffy quilts with her and she had spread it across the bed, making it almost impossible to see the TV over the layers of fluff. He was almost back to sleep when he felt her shiver and curl up tighter. Sighing, he reached out and pulled her into him, curling around her as she squeaked. \"Its fine, luv. Scrawny thing like you can never stay warm, can you?\" She grumbled something at him as she settled in to go back to sleep. Smirking, he looped his fingers through her hair as she turned and snuggled into his chest, sighing for the entire world like a contented kitten. He drifted into unconsciousness as he played with her hair, barely registering the distant triumphant chuckle from the living room.[Chapter 8] Moved They had already decided he would stay there in his flat so they would be ready to move first thing, seeing how Atley had volunteered to help Chaos and was the mastermind behind some grand plot to accelerate their budding relationship. Besides, Atley had spent many a night splayed across his sofa, so one more shouldn't have hurt . . . But as Chaos giggled over his shoulder, he had to wonder how he had ended up with this . Atley, still sleeping mind you, had rolled and tossed during the night, ending up with his head hanging off the sofa while his feet stuck straight up in the bloody air, propped against the back of the sofa piece he was sprawled over. He shook his head, going for the coffee pot as Chaos went into the bathroom to change. He smirked. Waking up with her had been worth spending half the night hanging off the bloody sectional, though he would never admit aloud. She was humming to herself as she came practically skipping into the kitchen, procuring two cups from his cupboards. She had handed him the cups, mirth dancing in her eyes as she backed away from him and went to wake Atley. He and Chaos had decided that they should have coffee before they started to move her apartment, less chance of an accident that way. As he yawned and hit the brew button on the pot, he had to smirk. Every time they texted or talked, it was a running joke for him to bring an extra shirt, so he had already stowed one away at her old apartment . . . though with her grace , he probably would need it by the end of the day. Honestly, she'd almost broken a toe on the phone at the store the other day, cussing a blue streak while her co-worker had stared. He grinned at that thought, a sight that would make Mirror practically piss himself. Who would've known that such foul language could come from such a sweet little thing? Movement and cursing alerted him to Atley's return to the living before his friend came stumbling into the kitchen. Sphinx raised a brow at the man's hair before shaking his head and going for the shower. As he was stepping into the bathroom, he heard Atley cuss as the coffee burnt his tongue and Chaos giggle as she told him to take smaller sips. It was certainly going to be an interesting day. Atley was, apparently, as amazed at the level of organization Chaos had put into her packing as he had been. Yesterday, he had conveniently \"forgotten\" where she'd put the lists, so that he could watch this unfold today. Just because Atley and Chaos meant something to him didn't mean he was above a little mean spirited fun. Especially seeing how all of their backs were going to hurt after today. Atley just kept looking from the lists to Chaosia like she was a crazy person, going, \"You did this? Sat and figured out your whole damn house before you moved?\" She nodded, bouncing from one foot to another as she pushed her headband back in place. She had forgone her glasses in light of the move and was dressed in a pair of rolled charcoal grey sweats that were pushed to her knees, layered black and white tank tops and a light red team track jacket with K Swiss shoes. Her hair was what kept drawing Sphinx's attention, though. She'd always worn it back or in a bun, but today it was piled in this huge nest atop her head in rebellion to all of Paul's posturing the day before, her new bangs held back by a red headband. She glared at him as he smirked at her hair again, before answering Atley. \"Yes, Atley. For the fifth time, I sat down and figured out my new apartment beforehand. That way all we have to do is move it into position instead of trying to find the right place for it. It'll cut hours off of our moving time.\" Atley just shook his head as rolled his sleeves and went to help Sphinx dismantle the beast she called a bed. Mikhail and the others were en route so they were waiting for the truck. She watched, snickering occasionally as Atley caught a finger in the bedrails and cursed, obviously still not awake despite six cups of coffee. A loud banging on the door before a high pitched shout of, \"Hello, Chaos darling! Where are you? I have a surprise for you, sweetness.\" announced Paul's arrival. Sphinx and Atley continued to dismantle the bed until they heard more voices than should have been present. Atley quirked a brow as Sphinx turned to listen, trying to see who was out there. Finally, they gave up trying to be sneaky and went into the main living area to find four boys around Chaosia's age, all decked in similar clothing and the same red track jackets. Chaos, seeing their arrival, turned and introduced her friends. \"Atley, Sphinx these guys are part of my soccer team. They've agreed to help with the heavy lifting if you want them to. This is Markus Orsinio, the defensive captain. And that is Andrews and McCullen standing near the fridge. Oh, and the guy with the dreads is Tobin, my favorite offensive player. Say hi guys.\" All four introduced themselves, though none of them veered too close to Sphinx, who was giving them one of his darkest looks as Mikhail and Memphis strolled through the open door. Introductions were made again as Tumbler and Kip came in, the former asking, \"So, you all play soccer with Chaos? I thought you played for the girl's team?\" Chaos had the decency to blush as Tobin slung an arm over her shoulder, ragging her. \"Oh not this beastie. See, Guadimus here is just too good at being a lineman to squander on the girls' squad, though she usually prefers being a center unless we absolutely need her. So our Coach brought her into the fold and lets her pretty much do her art thing in our off time. He even makes sure she has time to complete whatever finals she has during the season.\" Orsinio nodded as he stooped to help Tumbler move the sofa. \"Yeah. He even made us practice so you could get action shots for you photography final last semester, remember?\" Chaos just shrugged, waving off the input. \"Yeah, but also made all of us wear different colored jerseys and labels so you could remember a DNA sequence for advanced genetics, too, Mark. He takes care of us if he can. Even if he does cuss like a sailor every time he draws a breath. Besides, there are three other girls on our team. I'm not the only one who made the cut.\" Tobin laughed as stepped away from Chaos to help Kip with the loveseat. \"True that, Guadimus, but you are the only female who can play offensive. Oh, and you know that practice had been set an hour earlier this season right?\" Chaos groaned as she and Sway went to move the end tabled to the door for one of the men to take to the truck. \"Why this time?\" McCullen answered, giving Andrews a dark look as he almost dropped the driftwood coffee table on his foot. \"Over half of the defense is greener than frogs, Guadimus. And cocky. Coach is shifting practice up to humble them. It's only for a week. Are you going to help with the initiation?\" She grimaced as Sphinx, who had been helping carry out portions of the bed, stopped and looked at her. \"Hell no. You guys just make sure to give them a gross one for me. Just no bugs or creepy crawlies, okay? I still have flashbacks from that crap.\" The five laughed before separating to work. Chaos walked into the office and went to help Sphinx pick up the desk. Before they went to move it into the hall, however, she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him. He groaned, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her tightly against his chest as she threaded her fingers through his hair. When they parted for air, he looked down at her, clearly confused. She smiled; nipping is chin as she stood with him, content to just be held. \"I just wanted to wipe some of that dark cloud away. You've been positively brooding since they got here.\" He grunted, glowering at the door as he heard one of the younger footballers laugh and Tumbler groan. Apparently, they were getting along a little too well. She caught his cheek in her hand, turning him to look back at her before she kissed him. \"I don't want you to be upset, Sphinx. I want to talk to you and listen to you when you have something to say. I want to go get coffee and eat at the Penguin and laugh with you about Memphis being a dork. I would rather sit with you in your apartment all day not saying a word than listen to anyone else talk about everything else. Okay?\" He nodded, dipping his lips to hers again. The door flying open and Mikhail and Donnie's entrance caused them to part, but not before Mikhail groaned and Donnie chuckled. \"Man, Ripley, do you have to do that with me around? I mean, come on, sis. Let me keep my breakfast.\" Chaosia glared at him, kicking him hard in the shin as she walked past him to go back into the living room. \"Ouch! Oh come on, Rip! I was just joking! You can slobber all over each other all day if it makes you happy! No wait! No you can't-Oh GOD! Bad mental image! Donnie, kill me before that's burned into my retinas.\" Donnie just looked at him like he was crazy before helping Sphinx move Chaosia's light table/desk. Sphinx shook his head at Chaos as she refused to talk to Mikhail until he apologized, earning him a very dark look and lecture from Paul of all people. \"Would you please not stick your foot in your damn mouth about the two of them? I mean, seriously. You of all people should be happy she's sort of dating someone you know and trust, not bitching because you can't keep your mind of the gutter. Don't make me pour bleach in your ears, Mikhail. I'll do it if it'll clean up that filthy little brain of yours and give her peace, you hear me?\" Mikhail nodded, amazed that Paul's voice had deepened to where he sounded like a guy and not a prepubescent girl on crack. Satisfied that his will would be done, Paul turned and started chatting with Andrews who was laughing about the whole thing. As the last of the truck was loaded, the soccer volunteers departed, promising to come see Chaosia's place in a few weeks. Chaos had laughed, promising to see them at practice and sent them on their way before climbing into the Malibu with Sphinx. Atley had suddenly wanted to catch a ride with Donnie, swearing his classic Jaguar was making some sort of weird noise he just had to help diagnose. While Sphinx was pulling out into traffic, very close traffic, Chaos asked, \"Does Atley not realize that while I appreciate all of the time he's practically forcing us into private interaction, he really doesn't do a good job of hiding what he's doing?\" Sphinx looked at her, amazed as she continued to look out the window before he erupted into loud, booming laughter. \"I don't think he means anything by it, luv. He's just trying to be helpful. He always does. \" Chaos nodded. \"I'm starting to get that. He thought I was mad at you back at the apartment and swore that he would talk to you if he had to. He's a good man, Sphinx. Just . . . crazy and misguided, I think.\" Sphinx nodded, intrigued by the information she'd let slip. So Atley was trying to fix what he thought was broken? \"Why'd he talk to you then? If he swore you were mad?\" Chaos just looked at him like he was crazy. \"He's your friend , Sphinx. And he wants to help you when you're in trouble. I know that you don't think you have many friends, or have a need for them, but you do . I mean, Atley was going to help me move before they knew I was Mikhail's sister. Donnie would have too, from what I'm seeing. Sway kept our secret and let us be, even at the risk of being in the middle or upsetting Memphis. And speaking of which, Memphis and the others give you the space you want, but they try to make you feel included, too. They do care about you, in their own ways. You're lucky. You have a good, grounded group around you. Don't sell that short or take it for granted.\" He looked at her, truly speechless. Why was she always telling him things that he never wanted to hear? And why did hearing them always make him feel just a little bit more at peace with the way his life had taken shape? She smiled at him, reaching out to hold his hand as they sat at a red light. \"Don't worry. You having friends can be our little secret, okay?\" He glared; glad she'd taken things away from the heavy subject matter she'd strayed to. She turned, looking at him out of the corner of her eye as her smile took on a more sinister depth. He was suddenly wary of whatever was going to spill from her lips. \"That and your secret love of cuddling at night. I know you have a reputation to protect.\" He glowered, grinding his teeth as he pulled off from the light, smoking tires as she laughed at his expense then squealed as he rounded the turn back to their building. As they moved the last piece of furniture into Chaos's new apartment, Sphinx had to wonder how she had accumulated so much stuff in her short lifespan and managed for it all to come in some odd color. Her brown couches where adorned in several pillows of varying colors and patterns, though all were big and fluffy enough to act serve as seats themselves. Her coffee table, which was actually a huge finished piece of driftwood that had been sanded and flattened into a table, nestled between them. The entertainment center (that he built) now boasted a nice sized flat screen and surround sound while three sets of bookcases housed an enormous DVD and CD collection, a good section of which were actually foreign, including some British movies and bands. She had three barstools under her bar in the kitchen, each already covered in material and pillows to match the couches. Random masks and pictures adorned the walls; her and Sway's doing while the \"men folk\" moved the furniture. She had set up her bathrooms earlier, even switching out the standard showerheads for some huge raindrop deal that he had been eyeing with interest. The towels that hung were neutral with the pictures soaps and antique bottles in the room all matching the colors in the living room to tie it together. He could hear Sway in the bedroom down the hall practically decreeing that Chaosia was going to help her redo her own flat soon, causing the younger girl to laugh (and Memphis to groan) before agreeing. As he continued through, he noticed the smaller bedroom had become an art room with her glass topped light desk and art tables already set, as well as bookcases lined with school texts and labeled baskets housing art supplies. In one corner, a huge overstuffed chair they could both fit in was nestled with a lamp and small side table, which Atley had thoroughly enjoyed pointing out, was very similar to his own home upstairs. The master bedroom was his downfall though. Her mirrored side table, topped with a crystal lamp, sat off beside the bed. On the opposite wall, an antique white dresser was pinstriped to match her sheets in the same colors, with silver hardware (to make it seem more masculine she'd sworn) with a sliver flat screen TV/DVD combo mounted above it. And though he and Atley had dismantled the damned thing, he had no clue that her mahogany box canopy would look so bloody inviting when put back together. The white and blue striped sheets and cream comforter with the varying colors of throw pillows didn't look too girly. As a matter of fact, the sheer white fabric she had draped all around the thing made it seem private and inviting. He had to check himself more than once when he thought of hiding her in that thing and not coming back out. He sighed. It was way too early for those kinds of thoughts and while he wouldn't be adverse to it, Lord knows how he wouldn't be adverse to it; he knew she could be in the long run. And he wasn't in the habit of being anyone's mistake. Especially hers . As the others started to file out, he became acutely aware that he had no real reason to leave. With just her and her brother left, he stepped out to the fire escape to give them a moment. He was so wrapped up in not noticing the conversation that he almost jumped when she wrapped her arms around his waist, laying her cheek on his back and sighing. He ran a thumb over her hands, basking in the silence that now hung in the apartment comfortably. He turned, looking down at her. \"So,\" she asked, \"Do you want to get changed and go get something to eat? It's still pretty early. We could maybe even catch a movie . . .\" He faced her, pretending to debate the possibilities as he looped his arms around her waist and let her lean against his chest. She sighed, laying her cheek against his heart and tightened her arms around his middle. He knew he was going to be spending a lot of time in her home and her in his. Why not go out and enjoy an evening . . . \"Or, we could order Chinese and curl up in my bed for a change of pace. Maybe watch something you want to watch.\" He grinned, sweeping her up over his shoulder and carrying her inside while she laughed. He deposited her on the counter for her to order food while he perused her movies, finding one he wanted to see. Later that night, after the takeout had been mostly eaten and boxes thrown away, the two of them laid in Chaosia's bed, curled together watching Young Frankenstein as she lazily traced circles on the arm he had thrown over her hip and waist. They'd already seen Blazing Saddles and History of the World Part One, and though Monty Python was out and ready beside the TV, Chaosia doubted she'd stay awake to see it. She was the happiest she'd been in years. Actually, since she'd changed majors and given up all serious thought on being a pathologist. She had never really wanted to go into medicine, and though that had been the field most likely to hold her interest, she was thankful she'd come to her sense and switched to her passion. Just like she was thankful that she was clumsy enough to nearly scald the man lying next to her. The only thing to make this moment any better would be white chocolate raspberry truffles . . . I wonder if Paul found my stash . . . Sphinx, on the other hand, was torn. He enjoyed spending time with Chaos. Other than boost or terrorizing the idiots at work (both at the morgue and the garage), it's what he would want to spend most of his time doing. But he knew most women craved commitment, therein laid the problem with Chaosia. While he would have no problem committing to her, as much as he possibly could anyway, would she want to commit to anything serious with him? She had already proved to be far from normal in the regard to most women , with the issue of paying for dates and not wanting to be too clingy and emotional. What would she say to being asked to commit to a form of relationship? Only one way to find out, moron. Just ask the girl so you'll quit whining like a ninny. \"Luv? You awake?\" She rolled over, turning to face him. She smiled at him before cupping his cheek in her hand upon seeing the more-serious-than-usual expression on his face. \"What's wrong, Sphinx? Cat got your tongue?\" He rolled his eyes as she smirked at her odd form of humor, clearly telling her \"Very funny\" without saying a word. \"Nothing, luv. I was just wondering . . . what you want to do next.\" She raised a brow at him. \"Um? Go to sleep watching The Life of Brian?\" He growled at her, causing her to swat at his chest. \"No you silly little-US, luv. What do you want to next about US?\" She stilled, looking at his chest for a moment before shrugging and tucking her head under his chin, kissing his neck with each word she spoke. \"I don't know. I guess start going to lunch and dinner every once in a while and hang out. Get to know each other and stuff .\" He groaned, making her grin as she kissed his chin. \"You want to see each other, then? Proper like?\" She chuckled darkly, reminding him oddly of himself. If that's what he made the others feel like when he did that then it was probably a good thing he didn't do it often. \"Why, Mr. Sphinx? Are you asking me to be your girlfriend ?\" Gulping, and then cursed his self mentally for showing any weakness in front of her when she was so obviously not even fazed, he said, \"And if I am? What would you say?\" She smiled at him coyly before kissing his lips. \"I'd say yes. And then I'd ask you to go get the white chocolate truffles from the second shelf in the pantry, since it would be a cause for celebration and whatnot.\" He rolled his eyes and disentangled himself from her and the twenty million covers she kept on her bed. Oh, how she loved to be wrapped up in as many blankets as she could get was beyond him. On his way back to the bedroom, box of chocolate in hand, he realized what she'd said and how he'd acted. He groaned as he tossed the box at her and fell back into bed, grumbling. She laughed, asking, \"What's wrong?\" He grumbled again, covering his head with a pillow. She sighed, removing it as she asked again. \"What's wrong? Aren't you happy?\" He nodded, covering his eyes with his arm, muttering, \"Oh ecstatic . But I'm already turning into bloody Memphis . I'm doomed.\" She laughed, kissing his cheek before snuggling back up to him and offering him a white chocolate raspberry truffle. He took it from her fingers, grazing the digits with his teeth. He situated himself to where his head was in her lap as she fed him bits of her candies, always making sure to kiss him quickly after he took each bite. She smirked as she set the now empty box on the bedside table. \"Was that so horrible?\" He shrugged his brows at her, rubbing her arm with his hand as she ran her fingers through his hair. She smiled down at him before pushing him over so they could both lie back down. \"I'll make you a deal. And don't roll your eyes at me, Mister. My last one has worked in your favor already. I won't let you act like Memphis if you don't let me act like Sway. I love her to death, but she is far too needy for me.\" She extended her hand to him, \"Shake on it?\" Sphinx nodded, shaking her hand once before pulling her into him, rolling them to where he was above her. He smirked down at her as he lowered his lips to hers, whispering \"Deal, Lovely.\" She blushed and kissed him, noticing that his hands stayed above her hips and (for the most part) away from her chest as they explored each other's mouths. When they parted, she kissed up his cheek and pulled the lobe of his ear into her mouth, sucking once before letting go. He groaned, burying his face in her chest and grumbled something about cold showers. She laughed, running her hands down his back before telling him, \"I won't break , Sphinx. But thank you for being considerate.\" He nodded, never raising his head from her cleavage as he did so, just leaving little kisses here and there. She laughed, pushing him to the side and walloped him with one of the many pillows. He grinned. He'd have preferred to keep going but he wasn't going to nit-pick. They had all the time in the world to get comfortable around one another, so moving at her pace wasn't that much of a sacrifice. Besides, most of the women he'd dealt with were usually after one or a combination of four things: money, mindless sex, an accomplice or to \"play\" with something dangerous. She didn't seem to want any of those things, so it was best to let her lead the way . . . for now. As they settled back into a comfortable position, namely her draped across his chest with his hand tracing her curls, they started a quiet conversation. He was her boyfriend, after all, so some allowances could be made here and there, so long as she didn't expect it in anywhere but private. \"Will you tell me how you met him one day? Not right now. But one day, I want to hear about it from you . . .\" Sphinx nodded, frowning as he remembered something he'd overheard Memphis and Mikhail talking about with Atley. \"Fine, luv, if you'll tell me, one day, why he handles you with kid gloves then I'll tell you how we met.\" She shifted on the bed, before sighing and matter-of-factually explaining it to him, like it was something that happened every day. \"I survived something a few years ago that, according to Mikhail and a few doctors, should have killed me. A drunk driver ran a light and hit me in my old car doing about thirty over the limit. I got knocked around and the car actually flipped four times. If I'd been going any slower he would have hit more than just the tail end of my car but I just happened to get out of a class later than usual and I was trying to hurry to meet some friends. When I woke up, the cops were pulling the door off of my car and I was upside down. The other guy was awake and cussing because I had killed his car. Apparently, his Lexus didn't hold up well against my '67 Shelby Mustang 350 . . . . Though my poor car didn't hold up well either. I switched to Chevelles after that, more car to hit if I'm in another accident.\" He ran his fingers over the seven long crisscrossing scars on her shoulder and back. So like the various scars that dotted his own person, but these were different . Something about them just left this cold rage in the pit of his stomach. \"I managed to get to get my cell phone out and call Mikhail while the cops were cutting me out. Needless to say he and my father, who had been in London for business, were furious when they got to the hospital. Especially since I had been sent to sit in the morgue because of another huge wreck that had filled the ER. My dad even demanded that I move with him to England, swearing that it would be safer. I said no, apparently, but I switched majors after I went back to school. Nothing like spending a night in the morgue to make you rethink if that's what you wanted to do. Mikhail still feels bad that he wasn't there to protect me, I guess. I mean, Mom had just passed away and my dad was moving to another country. It's understandable that he'd freak. But this was almost four years ago and he still acts like I need to be watched over and he hates it when I drive.\" \"How did your back get scarred, then?\" She shrugged. \"Apparently both of my windshields busted and my seat belt is the only thing that kept me in the car. But half of the back glass actually came over my seat. The scars are from where I got myself out of the seat before the first responders could stop me. When you're in shock and can smell your car burning, you can do just about anything without feeling it.\" He sighed, pulling her into his chest. He was amazed to notice that when she talked about it, there was no anger or depression in her voice, just fact and acceptance. She almost sounded as peaceful discussing her scarring as she did talking about movies and Chevelles. She acted like it was a normal conversation she was having as she buried her face in his chest. It quite honestly threw him. He would have expected even the most seasoned boost to be a bundle of nerves at this point . . . Speaking of which . . . \"And what's this I hear about you being engaged to Frankie the Fish, then?\" She groaned, smacking him as she ground out. \"I am going to castrate my brother the big mouth. I can't believe he told you about Frankie. I swear, if I'd known hitting him was going to do that I would have just run him over and been done with it, considering.\" \"Considering?\" She shrugged. \"Considering the reason I hit him in the first place was he grabbed my chest and tried to stick his tongue down my throat. I mean, what did he expect? A freaking reward? He was so shocked that I punched him and then jabbed him in the throat that he actually dropped to his knees. Apparently he was God's gift and I didn't get the memo.\" Sphinx looked down at her, shocked and more than a little, dare he say it, proud that she's done something so sinister, even if it had been to Frankie the Fish. She shifted, continuing, \"Anyway, Mikhail just can't except that he still owes me for all of that shit. And then when Frankie started calling and sending those weird gifts, he and Eddie actually made me get a gun and a license, just in case. Just in case Frankie finally flipped or I finally had enough, one of the two. \" Sphinx sat up, looking down at her in amazement. \"You have a gun and a license to carry it? Do I even want to know what kind?\" She shrugged, reaching over and opening the top drawer of her bedside table, extracting a rather large case and setting it in front of him as she sat up. He opened it, blown away at what was laying before him. \"This isn't a gun, Chaosia. You're right, it's a bloody cannon ! Don't you think its overkill ? Aren't these illegal here?\" She gave him a deadpan look, having found one of the SPAS12 shotguns he kept tucked away in his coat closet earlier today. \"Oh, and now you're the law abiding citizen? Really Sphinx, it's just a Desert Eagle, it's not like it's a Tommy gun or anything.\" He shook his head, handing her the case and watched as she slid it back in the drawer. Lord help him, she could very well be the death of him. They'd talked a bit more, though she'd done most of it while he just responded when necessary, before she finally yawned and snuggled into him, whispering her goodnight as she kissed his chest over his heart. When she was asleep, he looked down at her shoulder and back, tracing the scars that she'd been left with. He was amazed as he recalled his anatomy, placing nerves and organs under each jagged glass scar. The two largest ones were the nastiest and should have left her hurt if not dead; one actually going to her lung and the other the backside of her heart. The smaller ones across her spine and up into her shoulder, now camouflaged by the huge phoenix tattoo on her left side, should have left her with some form of nerve damage or at least limited mobility, yet she seemed fine. She was definitely stronger than her brother, or even she realized. As he drifted to sleep, he couldn't help but wonder why Mikhail had never said anything about the wreck, even when they'd been talking earlier. The whole crew would have gone to any length to help him with seeing to her had they known . . . and the two wouldn't have had to face this alone. He was definitely going to have words with the boy about this . . . after he finally took Chaos to breakfast in the morning. Okay, so here's another chapter. Yeah . . . hopefully i can give you another before tomorrow. If not, definitely by the end of the week![Chapter 9] Okay, for all of those reading, this chapter takes Sphinx and Chaos from a PG-13 relationship on and into an R setting. However, unless I am specifically asked, I am not going to up my rating which means I'll be alluding to the missing portions of the upcoming chapters. This does not mean that this story is going into the pure fluff and sappy realm. Oh no. But be warned this one does get somewhat odd and fluffy and just down right silly. DISCLAIMER: THE ONLY THING I OWN ARE THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS AND A NOW WONDERFULLY RESTORED CHEVELLE SS THAT IS STILL EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME IN GAS. The Distance From Friends to Lovers All was right in the world and had been for two weeks. Chaosia was moved and her practices were finally back to their normal time, which meant that she was able to actually see some of her boyfriend before and after class without sacrificing her coveted sleep. Said boyfriend was well aware of just how precious sleep was to the art student after she'd missed her coffee and snapped at him before running off to practice. Of course she'd called and apologized and he had let her off, but he had learned a valuable lesson for dealing with Chaosia: Let her sleep or be armed with coffee. On practice mornings, the blacker the better. And after that tiny hiccup, Sphinx was happily (well for him, anyway) getting to reap the benefits of having a girlfriend who not only understood a good bit of what happened in the morgue, but was usually interested in what happened there. It was today, fifteen minutes before his morgue shift ended that he had to relish that fact, especially with the pile of paperwork he'd be bringing in tonight. Thank God she retained a good portion of her medical studies and actually liked \"checking\" his paperwork. Her checking usually turns into fixing whatever the other idiots did before I have to. And she could tolerate his boosting as well. She had even made a compromise with him on that regard. \" If you promise not to get maimed, shot, stabbed or killed I have no problem. Do whatever you were doing before. However, If you do get maimed, shot or stabbed, I'm going to send you to your precious morgue myself. And if you get killed, I'm raising you from the dead and killing you all over again, got it?\" Sphinx smirked, glancing at the clock on the wall in the larger autopsy room as her voice flitted through his head. She was too damned cute to actually be threatening when she'd found out that Atley had a score he wanted help on, but Lord did he love it when she turned vicious on Atley and Memphis, swearing death and worse if they allowed him to get hurt. Mikhail had been the saving grace for this new boost, swearing on their mother's grave that he wouldn't let one hair on Sphinx's head to be out of place when he returned home. She had consented then, offering him his bargain. And after the others left, she'd been very persuasive in getting him to promise not to let anything happen to himself, Atley or her brother . . . Hell, she'd gotten him to swear to come to all of her games and cook dinner tonight for when she helped with his paperwork. Speaking of which . . . . He glanced at the clock again. Was the bloody thing even moving? To hell with it. He was leaving early. He never had before and today seemed as good as any to start. Especially since he knew if he got to either apartment before her he could watch her slink around in those wonderful soccer shorts of hers. He grinned, basking in that knowledge as he grabbed coat and paperwork before going to clock out. Her game shorts were knee length, well beyond regulation . . . but her practice shorts were borderline indecent. He had almost stroked when he had come through her patio door to find her stretching and chatting away with Andrews, painfully unaware of just how much of her long tanned legs she was showing. He'd almost killed the boy on the spot before he heard his saving grace. She was trying to get him to date Paul and neither had the balls (metaphorically of course) to ask the other out. She was practically ragging him worse than anything Kip or Tumbler could toss out when she spotted him. She'd smiled and waved before forming herself into a human pretzel and continuing on with her conversation. Sphinx shook himself as he walked to his car, having finally left the morgue. No one with bones should be able to bend like that, but Chaosia had acted like it was fine. She'd even kept up a conversation while he'd beat a hasty retreat to his own home for a very cold shower and two hours of the unsexiest thing he could find on television: the home and garden channel. She'd laughed when she'd come up later but if she'd known how damned bad her doing little things like that drove him bat shit crazy for her, he'd be a whipped man. And today was one of the days that the fate of a whipped man didn't seem so bad. Especially since he hadn't seen her all damned day. He drove on, only stopping for lights and signs as he made his way back home. He didn't dare think about how two weeks ago he'd been standoffish about having her in his life and how now he was damned sure he was going to try and keep her there. Chaosia walked into her apartment, throwing bags and papers on the nearest couch as she made her way down her hall to her bedroom. She needed a long hot bath and a bottle of Jack in the worst way. Her wonderful, adoring Coach had pulled her aside to inform her that he was going to be out of the country for four weeks for a wedding . . . and he was leaving her and Orsinio in charge of practices and scrimmage, though he practically decreed in front of the team that she was the one in charge of all drills, work outs and exercise. As soon as Coach was out of earshot, she and Orsinio had come to an agreement: Two practices per week ending with a scrimmage on the second. This meant they could focus on things other than soccer for a while . . . and as long as the green defense didn't cause any more problems, then she wouldn't drill them into the damn pavement again. Which is why her legs felt like they were about to fall off. Mouthy little twits had decided to test her. The 350 laps she'd made them run up the steps of the stadium and then back down had all of their legs burning . . . but her offense had taken it in stride. They were used to it from their practices. The poor defense was about to stroke. For about two seconds, she'd contemplated calling Sphinx and letting him run her drills for her. She'd smirked at the mental image of her usually terrifying boyfriend glaring at the newbies, sending them scaling the steps quicker than their Coach ever could before dismissing it entirely. Save that for drastic measures. As she ran her bath, she called Sphinx, telling him to forget dinner and just to come eat pizza with her in about an hour. He'd been elated to escape kitchen detail for the evening but promised to cook another time before hanging up. Chaosia had just shed her clothes and was sinking in the tub when her bathroom door opened. She looked up, thankful for the mountain of frothy bubbles hiding her from view as Sphinx casually strode in the room, dropping to sit beside the tub as she looked at him tiredly. She wanted to scold him or work up enough energy to be outraged at his intrusion of her privacy and modesty, but she just couldn't. He seemed to get that as he shook his head and picked up a washcloth, soaking it in the water before he ran it over her back. She moaned, leaning so he could get the rest. \"I swear if you keep doing that I won't freak out at you. What are you doing here so early?\" He shrugged, washing her back with gentle circles. \"Figured you needed something to yell at with how you sounded over the phone . . . .\" She shrugged, hissing at the slight movement causing her shoulders to pop. Sphinx raised a brow. \"What have you done to yourself now?\" \"Nothing worse than I did to the defense. I swear those boys are idiots. I had to make the whole team run over 300 stadium laps before they would even attempt to listen. Now, I'm just sore and cranky so be warned I won't be good company.\" He gave a deadpan look as if asking her \"You think I'm worried about you being good company?\" She grunted, resting her forehead on the cool porcelain of the claw foot tub. \"And I know you don't care. Hell, you'll probably just be thrilled to have peace and quiet for a night. I'm just warning you, is all.\" He nodded before leaning forward and placing a kiss on her hair then stood to leave. As he made his way out of the bathroom, he heard her groan and lean back. He shook his head, deciding to go ahead and call in their pizzas for her. Lord knows if she was that tired she'd probably already forgotten. He walked by the couch, shaking his head at the bags on her couch. She would freak tomorrow when she realized she had left them out and in such a state but if he moved them into her office, then he was stepping further into the whipped realm of thinking than he wanted. So, he avoided looking at the bags as he ordered their food and turned completely away from them so he didn't have to see them as he sat on her other sofa to watch television. Finally, he pulled case files out to work on so he had an honest to God reason to not touch the offending bags. God, boy-o. You're losing it. Just ignore the damn things. It's not like she asked you to pick them up or anything. Just do your damn work and leave it be. Besides, you'd probably just put them in the wrong spot anyway. And with that thought, he buried himself in work, listening to whatever show she had on. And he only glanced at the bags four more times before he heard her go into her bedroom to get dressed. As Chaosia emerged from her bedroom, she marveled at what was waiting on her. Two pizza boxes were perched on her coffee table with two beers (and already on coasters without having to be told!) and a huge pile of paperwork beside them but minus her stoic boyfriend. She smiled, shaking her head as she moved to get her bags and move them into the office. They could just sit anywhere in there but here in the living room she would go nutty looking at them. It was when she went to look for them that she noticed they weren't there. She quirked a brow, going back down the hall to her office, opening the door to find the art tote neatly beside her desk and her messenger bag in the arm chair. She looked back, puzzled. She knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had not put them there . . . had she? Shaking her head, she walked back into the living room, spying Sphinx settled into the couch with a case file in his lap and one of the beers in hand. She stopped, just watching him. It still amazed her how he could make small things seem graceful and dignified while she could turn small things into full blown catastrophes. She wondered, for a split second, if he boosted with the same deadly grace and determination that he handed everything else with, even paper work. If he did, then he was truly a sight to behold if anyone could catch him. She'd learned from Sway and Mikhail that he was one of the best, especially when it came to classics and muscle. I wonder what it would be like to watch him boost . . . He'd probably die if I ever asked to tag along, though. He looked up at her, brow raised as she walked over to the couch and sat beside him. She grabbed a piece of pizza, downing it quickly and took a long drought of her beer. She turned, blushing as she noticed him watching her intently. \"What? I know it amazes you that I eat, Sphinx. But I do. Thank you, by the way.\" He snorted, scowling as he put the file on the table and throwing his arm over the back of the couch, allowing her to settle into him before he draped it over her shoulders. \"For what?\" She shrugged, laying her head on his chest as she picked up the remote and flicking through channels. \"For letting me have my space, for getting pizza, for putting my mess away while I was in the tub . . . Just for being considerate. It means a lot to me.\" His scowl darkened as he grumbled to himself, but he pulled her closer all the same. She smirked, burying her head into his chest to hide it from him. She loved making him grumble. Most people probably pissed themselves when he started but she thought it was cute, especially when he did it after he'd done something sweet and got caught. Finally, she settled on watching \"Dexter\" before leaning up and kissing his cheek. \"I don't expect you to do this stuff, Sphinx. If it makes you uncomfortable just tell me . . . okay, bad choice of words. Just let me know , however you chose and we'll work on it. Now hand me that case file.\" He handed over the file, shaking his head as he picked a new one. As he heard he snort at something, he knew it was going to be a long night. Finally, at about two o'clock in the morning, Sphinx decided they needed to call it a night. Chaosia was barely awake, pen in hand as she almost nodded off for the second time in three minutes. He rescued the case file from her, putting it safely with its brethren before taking the pizza boxes and empty beer bottles into the kitchen. After securing the pizzas in the fridge and tossing the bottles, he came back into the living room chuckling as he saw Chaos was actually asleep sitting up. \"That must be a useful habit in class, luv. Come on, let me put you to bed.\" She started awake, wide eyed before she saw him, rolling her eyes as she got off the sofa and headed to her bedroom. He shook his head at her. At least she was already in sweatpants and a tank top so he wouldn't have to force her to change. She really was like a child when it came to getting her to do something when she was half asleep . . . though he knew he wasn't any better. She tossed her glasses on the bedside table and climbed under her covers, sleepily patting the spot beside her. He chuckled, shaking his head. \"No, luv. I don't stay when you have class, remember?\" She looked at the clock and then to him, like he was crazy. \"Sphinx? It's Friday, meaning I don't have class tomorrow and it's late. Just get in bed.\" He shrugged, not even bothering to argue. He knew it was only Thursday and that she did have a class tomorrow . . . but he wasn't going to argue. He set the alarm on his phone and tucked it under the pillows before shedding his over shirt and pants. He was down to underwear and a wife beater when he heard her snort. He looked up and was amazed as she started to shake with barely contained laughter. He tried to wait it out, mentally contributing whatever was going on as a result of fatigue, until he finally snapped. \"What in the bloody hell is so funny, Chaosia?\" She started to laugh out loud then, almost rolling off the bed as she wheezed. Finally, as the vein on the side of his head started to pulse she sat up and tried to keep a straight face as she explained. \"What in the world are you wearing?\" He stood to his full height, looking down and surveying the black wife beater and dark brief underwear. He looked back at her like she was crazy before shaking his head. He was not going into anything with her tonight. Not while she was like this. He was liable to snap and to more damage than even he and Atley could fix. But when he looked back up and saw the unadulterated mix of mirth, astonishment and lust dancing in her eyes, he had to say something. \"I'm wearing underwear and a damn beater, Chaosia. Same as I always do. Why?\" She shook her head, stretching back out as she faced him with her check propped on her hand. She lazily perused his body, making him feel slightly exposed and extremely uncomfortable. \"We are going to go and get you some other underwear, honey. You look like you raided a five-year-old's drawer. Not that I'm complaining per say, because they definitely accentuate some great aspects . . . but . . . seriously, Sphinx. Tightie Whities?\" He glared, crossing his arms as he looked down his nose at her. \"They are not white, Chaosia-\" \"I know, Sphinx. Hardly anything you own is white. But still, there close enough.\" He leveled his darkest scowl, which only earned him peals of laughter. Cursing, he tore the wife beater off and ran a hand down his face. He noticed, however, that she wasn't laughing anymore. He opened his eyes, looking at her hesitantly. She was just staring at him, mouth open . Great. Now what? Chaosia had only been having some good old fashioned, mean spirited fun at her normally too serious boyfriend's expense. Honestly, she really didn't have that much against the briefs and if he liked them, then who was she to say anything . . . but it was too good an opportunity to pass up. And it had all been going so well until he shed that damn wife beater and exposed that wonderful chest of his. Did he not realize just how nice he looked without a shirt? He was toned and defined without being too muscular, with only a small fan of dark hair on his upper chest though his torso was littered with lighter scars that had healed. The beginnings of the black Sphinx on his left shoulder was visible, something she loved to trace with her fingers. Usually, all she ever got to see was his chest . . . but tonight, courtesy of the formerly despised briefs she could see his abs and that wonderful deep V where his pelvic bones were . . . and a nice taught butt and glorious legs. God, she was never going to make fun of the underwear again. And if he didn't put a shirt back on, they weren't going to leave her bed ever again either. She forced herself to look up and into his eyes, focusing on how they were more green than anything right now until she could trust herself to speak. He shifted, glaring at her as he asked, \"Well? Anymore laughs, then?\" She straightened, pulling the covers back as she patted his spot. \"Nope. Not one. I'm sorry, I'm just tired and silly and being a bitch on top of it. Forgive me?\" He glared at her before shaking his head and climbing in beside her, keeping his distance. She sighed, head downcast as she rolled over. Way to go, genius. The closest you've ever gotten him to nude and what do you do? You laugh at him and make really bad jokes. God, I should have been lobotomized before I screwed this up so badly. She looked back over her shoulder, seeing that he'd rolled away from her. Finally, she gathered what was left of her courage and rolled over, snuggling up to his back. He stiffened as she wrapped her arms around him and laid her head on his shoulder, kissing the sphinx tattoo as she whispered to him. \"I really am sorry, baby. I was just picking. You can keep them, I swear I won't say anything else. Please don't be mad.\" He snorted, rolling over to face her, allowing her to snuggle into his bare chest as he shook his head. \"I'm not mad, woman, just confused. First you insult me then you start looking like a bloody starving woman at a buffet. Seriously, luv, you send more weird signals than a-\" She cut him off mid-rant, kissing him hungrily as ran a hand down his chest and around to his back. He groaned into the kiss, rolling them to where he was on top. When they parted for air, one of his hands was on her hip while the other was cupping the side of her face. She kissed him again, leaving a trail down his jaw and to his neck. He shuddered closing his eyes as she chuckled, tracing his back and chest as she brought her hands up to cup his face. \"I am sorry, Sphinx. Will you forgive me if I promise to make it up to you?\" He nodded, eyes never opening as he informed her, \"Yeah, Love. I'll forgive you. But we'd better cut this short or we are definitely not leaving this bed tomorrow. I have work and you do have class.\" She smiled, kissing his right below his ear as she whispered, \"Actually, I'm taking a day tomorrow because of the practice today. So we could lie in bed all day if you want to go send an email to your supervisor . . . If you want to that is . . .\" He swallowed loudly, finally looking at her. She could tell he wanted to but that sense of following . . . whatever it was that he followed was getting in the way. Finally, something won as he rested his forehead on hers, whispering hoarsely \"Only of you want to, lover. I promise it's your decision. Just tell me what you want , Chaosia.\" She smiled, kissing him. \"I want you , Sphinx. As much as you want to give me. We'll go as far as we're both comfortable with, okay?\" He quickly pulled his phone out from under the pillows and sent a text to his supervisor's cell number. She shook her head, knowing it wasn't the email he would normally be expected to send but it would do until they got to a computer sometime tomorrow. He tossed the phone, dipping his lips to hers. \"Tell me when you're uncomfortable and we stop. Deal?\" She giggled, nodding as she met his lips with her own. \"Sure, sure. I'll let you know.\" And those were the last six words spoken all night. Thanks for all of the reviews and support! Oh, and if anyone can figure out where the inspiration for the underwear bit came from, just drop me a line and I'll give a cookie! Seriously! I have chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia nut! I just have to figure out how to get them to you . . . Anyway, it's late and I'm drifting into insanity . . . so later.[Chapter 10] Sorry it took so long to get this chapter up. It's been done but trying to find time to edit it was a pain. Thanks for the reviews and the encouragement. It means a lot! A small warning, this chapter contains some fluffy bits, but don't worry, nothing too OOC. The Morning After As the sun filtered in through the large windows in Chaosia's bedroom, bathing the room in warm light, Sphinx had to quietly admit that life was good. As a matter of fact, as he was brushing Chaosia's bangs away from her face while she slept beside him, he couldn't really see how it could get much better. Chaos had invited him to stay the night, and rather than spending all night watching movies or doing random bits of paper work and homework, they had taken a huge step towards another realm of relationship. And he honestly couldn't have been more pleased if he had just boosted three McLarens and four Bugattis . . . And all it had taken was for her to practically laugh her ass off at him for his choice in underwear last night. He snorted, shaking his head as he watched her sleep cuddled into his chest, one of her arms draped over his waist. There was no way in hell he was ever going to tell her that the only reason he'd even had the damn things ( versus his normal boxers that she rarely saw) on was because he'd fallen lax in his laundry habits since they'd started dating. It hadn't been intentional, but somehow he just couldn't bring himself to finish a load of laundry if she was in his apartment. Oh, sure, he'd walked in and caught her folding and hanging clothes numerous times since she'd moved. So many that he swore she had eight wardrobes floating around her closets and drawers . . . until she'd confided in him that laundry was actually a vice for her. She loved to wash and fold clothes; so much so that she usually helped Mikhail with his if he needed it. And knowing that, he should have been fine with doing his damned washing, but every time he tried, she always seemed to pop in and he forgot or quickly ushered her out of his laundry room. She'd even offered to help, but that would have been too weird. Oh sure, they were dating and sleeping together. And so he'd seen her folding all of those nice silk, satin and lacey bits she preferred but it was just weird for him to accept her help in laundry. That was a mother or wife task . . . not a practically new girlfriend task . . . Her yawn brought his attention to her as she stretched and looked up at him sleepily. She smiled at him, kissing his chest over his heart (a place she'd told him last night was her favorite place to kiss, seeing as how it rarely got any love at all). He shook his head, running a hand down her arm as she propped herself up to match his position. \"Good morning.\" He nodded to her, leaning in and kissing her lightly. She giggled, running her hand over his chest as they just enjoyed their quiet morning; the first of (hopefully) many as lovers. Finally, she peaked at him through her lashes and bangs, shyly asking, \"Did you have a good night's sleep?\" He chuckled darkly, resting his forehead on hers as he pulled her in tighter to his chest. \"Yeah, Love. A great night. Yourself?\" She nodded, blushing darker than he'd ever seen her as she settled into his chest again. \"I think we're going to have to cut our work sessions closer or plan them earlier. Because there is no way I can get up at five every morning for practice and not be exhausted if that's how most of our nights our going to end now.\" He smiled at her as he leaned in and whispered, \"Who said anything about that being a strictly nighttime activity, then?\" She groaned, smacking his chest as she grumbled at him, \"Great, now you're going to turn into a nympho, aren't you? Just remember we have work and school and people who will either miss us if we don't show up or be very embarrassed if we're caught.\" He chuckled, stretching before turning to glance at the clock. He sat up, looking down at her as he shrugged and stood, making his way to her bathroom. She came in behind him, shaking her head as she turned on the shower and procured towels from her linen closet. She turned, jumping when she noticed he had snuck up behind her. She swallowed loudly as she extended a towel like it was a laurel branch. \"I'm going to grab a shower really quick and then you can get one. If you'll tell me what you want to wear, I'll go get it for you . . .\" He stopped, momentarily intrigued by the offer and its thoughtfulness, before relenting. \"Whatever, Love. I trust you.\" She smiled at him, practically beaming as she stepped into the shower. Sphinx, to his credit, waited the appropriate few moments before drawing back the curtain and stepping in behind her. He was sure half of their building heard his laughter and her screams as she realized that he'd just invaded her shower. Chaosia was still blushing as she quickly made her way up the fire escape to Sphinx's apartment, muttering to herself about shower thieves and closet stoic nymphos. She used his key and opened the door, shaking her head as she barely caught herself from tripping. She sighed and moved a pair of his work boots to their spot beside the front door before making her way to his bedroom. She knew that he worked almost constantly, in one form or another, but it had still amazed her how very little clutter or mess was ever present in his home. Honestly, he was a guy so some form of catastrophe was supposed to lurk in the shadows and rear its ugly head at an inopportune moment. It's just the way it was. Especially if Paul or her brother were anything to judge by . . . She shuddered as she thought of her brother's apartment and made a mental note to go help him clean and do laundry soon, which would hopefully not include borrowing a Hazmat suit from the Chem department to clean the fridge this time. As she grabbed a pair of dark jeans, a charcoal tee shirt and his suspenders (Lord in heaven help her if she forgot those sacred suspenders and Sphinx might have to wear a belt), she realized she needed to get socks and underwear for the man currently lounging on her couch with nothing but one of her towels wrapped around his waist. She closed her eyes, forcing that image from her mind so she could focus on the task at hand. They were going to eat before she would indulge in any more carnal delights . . . and not only because she was about to starve. Staying in bed all weekend wouldn't do either of them much good and, while it would definitely be fun, they had plans to go to the grill out at Otto's and they were going. Which is why she needed to find his underwear and sock drawers and get back downstairs before he decided to come and get her, dressed or not. As she started opening drawers, though, she noticed something very odd. The drawers were large, lined and deep but had very little in them. She knew he'd had more clothes than this when she spent the night the first time. She'd seen the mounds of folded shirts and boxers and socks when he'd been looking for something to wear. So where was it all? She opened the closet again, noticing a multitude of empty hangars. Where were all of his clothes? As she made her way back and into the kitchen, it struck her that maybe there was a clean load in the laundry room that just needed to be folded and put away. She bit her lip, torn between what to do. If she called and asked where they were, she would seem flightier than she already was. But if she just went into the laundry room, a room she knew he kept her out of completely because of her folding habits, without permission then it could be a breach in some manly code of macho-ness or something. And men of any age hated to have their macho-ness messed with or tarnished in any way. Finally, she gave into the temptation and set the clothes on the kitchen counter, noticing that his dishwasher needed to be reloaded again. She sighed, stopping and doing so quickly. He did allow her to do that so he couldn't get mad at her. As she shut the door and turned the knob to ON, she had to marvel at Sphinx. Most men would love a girlfriend that was borderline OCD and loved to clean and do laundry . . . but he was dead set against her doing anything to help him clean but the bare minimum. Sway and Paul were in agreement that it was some personality quirk or a control issue while she personally thought that he didn't want to get used to relying on anyone. As she opened the door to the laundry room, however, she made up her mind that he was going to have to get used to it. Fast . He had over seven loads of clothes that were different states of laundry need, and the only thing in his dryer was towels. She sighed, pulling out her phone and sending him a text, telling him it would be about thirty minutes. At least there was a load of boxers, undershirts and socks in the washer that just needed to be dried. As she unloaded and reloaded the dryer, she took the towels to the kitchen and folded them before tucking them in his linen closets. She then set to work cleaning his counters because she noticed while they weren't dirty, they were now covered with towel lint and fuzzies. Then she had to clean the sink because it looked dingy next to the counters. And the floor had to be swept and damp mopped to keep up with the counters and sink. When she moved to the living room to sit down and try not to get herself into any more trouble, she noticed that the coffee table needed to be cleaned and the sectional needed to be rearranged and the pillows fluffed back into shape. And then the TV needed to be dusted and the entertainment center had DVDs and CDs that needed to be relocated to their proper homes on his shelves in the office. And then the office . . . She quickly closed that door to keep from stripping every piece of furniture and paperwork from the room and starting over fresh. Honestly there were some stacks that were taller than her! And though that wasn't hard, the few that probably matched their owner's height were impressive. As she was making his bed and taking all of the dirty clothes she could find into the laundry room to sort it into loads (he couldn't bitch about that too badly considering, could he?) she had to marvel at what had happened. Lord, what had she done to his apartment and how was he going to handle it? Her phone went off at the same time the dryer buzzer did, alerting her to the fact that the clothes were done and her boyfriend was probably more than a little suspicious by now. She opened the phone, almost afraid to hear what he had to say when she answered. \"Hello?\" \" And just what is taking so long, Chaosia?\" She gulped and decided to not say anything too specific as it would just get her in deeper when he found out she'd cleaned half his apartment while he sat downstairs, nude and in a towel, waiting on his clothes. So, she went the only route she could think of that wasn't downright lying or not saying anything at all: jabber away until he said okay. It always worked with her Dad and Mikhail. \"I folded a load of towels while I was waiting on your boxers to dry. You left a load in the washer and the drawer was empty and if I left those clothes in that washer all night and all day then they would sour. Did you know clothes will sour, honey? Well they will and you have to wash them like a million times to get that smell out of the fabric or you just have to throw them away. But your clothes are dry now and I'll be on my way back down in a minute. Do you want me to start another load? I could put in some of your jeans. It takes jeans a long time to sour and the extra time that we'll be at Otto's will actually help them drain so it's not so hard on your dry-\" \" That's fine Chaosia. Just hurry back.\" And with that the line was dead. She sighed, leaning back against the dryer and shaking her head for a moment before starting the jeans and gathering up what she needed. As she was locking the door back to Sphinx's apartment, her phone went off again. She juggled the basket of laundry (that she was holding hostage until it was folded whether he liked it or not) and the pile of clothes to one hand and put the keys in her mouth long enough to find and answer the phone. \"Herro? I mean, hello?\" \" What were you doing?\" She groaned, great. It was Sway. She started back down the fire escape, showcasing more balance than most people thought she possessed. \"I was just locking Sphinx's door and juggling laundry. Why? What's up?\" \" Oh! You have a key now and you're doing laundry? Don't you dare say a word to Memphis or he'll start about why I don't do stuff like that for him.\" Chaosia chuckled, opening her patio door and sitting the basket one her counter and scanning for her boyfriend before continuing to talk. \"Yeah, bloody likely, Sway. Seriously, that man would have to have a death wish to ask that kind of question, you know? Besides, mine is probably going to freak. And I used his key, thank you.\" She could practically hear Sway rolling her eyes as she said, \"Oh, sure. Whatever. Are you two coming today? You know it starts in about an hour. If Sphinx wants to make one of his late entrances then I could come get you earlier.\" Chaosia smiled, shaking her head as she took Sphinx's clothes into the bedroom, still looking for him. Honestly, where could a half nude 6'2\" boost hide? \"No, its fine, Sway. We'll be there sometime pretty soon. Just don't let them eat everything before we get there, okay?\" Sway laughed , \"Sure thing,Chaos. They usually won't because they fear Otto's wrath but I think they'll leave plenty today because of him and you're brother and Junie, who can't wait for you to get here, by the way. She keeps saying something about getting you to watch Singing in the Rain with her if it turns into the normal car fest.\" Chaos smiled as she walked back down the hallway to the kitchen, intent to fold as much of that basket of clothes as she could before Sphinx saw it. Junie had latched on to the fact of another girl who, despite not liking the hair and make-up, wasn't all about cars and boosting them. She'd loved talking about the classical movies and musicals that Chaosia's own mother had cherished. She sighed; fighting the wave of nostalgia that she knew would follow her all day if she didn't quell it now. Junie reminded her of her mother in a lot of ways, but the similar tastes in movies was something that it was taking some serious effort to partake in without wallowing in the empty space her mom had once inhabited in her life. She sat the now folded towels back in their basket, placing it on the floor beside the kitchen counter. \"I figured she probably would. Look, let me find him and we'll be there soon. Later.\" She turned, jumping and dropping the phone as she ran into Sphinx. He had apparently found his clothes since he was wearing the jeans and had the shirt in one hand . . . and his house keys in the other. He was looking down at her with one of the darkest glares she'd ever seen when she heard him ground out \"And what part of do not clean my house did you not understand, Chaosia?\" She smiled weakly, shrugging before taking off out of the kitchen and away from him. He was hot on her heals until she cleared her coffee table and shot down the hallway. She almost made it to her bedroom door when he caught her and swung her over his shoulder, grumbling all the time. \"Bloody fucking amazing. You can't walk two inches without tripping but you can hurdle coffee tables in single bounds. Maybe you should run everywhere you go, Chaos.\" He dropped her on the couch while he pulled the shirt over his head and deposited the keys in his pocket. She looked up at him, flushed from running and trying not to laugh as he'd hauled her back into the main area of her apartment. \"Do you like carrying me around like a sack of potatoes and jumping out of shadows to scare me to death?\" He shrugged, crouching in front of her so they were eye level. She rolled her eyes at what came out of his mouth next. \"I do NOT want you playing maid, Chaosia. Understood?\" She shrugged, crossing her arms as she looked away from him. \"Whatever. I just tidied up while I was waiting on your clothes. I didn't even check your fridge or touch your office, I swear! Besides, what's so wrong with a little help, Hmm? YOU like to help me do laundry, why can't I help you with some things?\" He shook his head as he caught her face in his palm, turning her to look at him. \"It's not your place to keep up after me or anyone else. Your bloody brother takes advantage of that far too much for my liking from what you and Paul gossip about.\" She stopped, actually cocking her head to the side as she stared at him like he was crazy. \"Um, I force Mikhail to let me clean his apartment, honey. He's just learned not to fight it anymore is all. Besides, he always forgets that the food in the fridge will eventually grow its own ecosystem if it's not thrown away. Plus, I like to do stuff like that. But if it makes you uncomfortable then I won't okay?\" He rolled his eyes. \"It's not about that, woman. It's about the fact that it's too . . . too . . .\" \" Domestic ?\" He glared at her as she giggled, knowing she was right. \"Oh please, honey. You want to keep your man secrets as long as you can. That's fine. I can accept that. Besides, I wouldn't want to step on your toes by folding something the wrong way.\" He glared at her. \"Chaosia . . .\" She, however, wasn't going to be stopped as she looked at him, brow raised and more than a little mirth and laughter dancing in her sea glass green eyes. \"Or by making the bed wrong. And Lord, I might get glared to death if I hung your shirts in the wrong spo- AHH!\" He picked her up, throwing her back over his shoulder and carrying her to her bedroom before literally tossing her on the bed and decreeing, \"Get dressed, ya bloody loon before you make us both late.\" She stuck her tongue out at his retreating back, knowing that the deep grumbling walking away from her bedroom door was probably a step in the right direction, whatever direction it was. As she started to change for the grill out, she smiled and shook her head at him before pulling out a flowing peasant skirt and a lacey tank top. She would at least dress like a girl today since she'd already played maid. Okay. There it is. I have a few days off so maybe I can get a could portion of this bad boy edited and up. Later![Chapter 11] OMG! Two chapters in one day! The world is ending! Okay. Here's the grill out and the aftermath. Hope you like. Of Grills Outs and Gossip Boys Sphinx was well aware that Chaosia was joking before he threw her on her bed. He was also aware that if he would just admit that it was okay that she'd helped out around his apartment, then normal life could resume. But it just wasn't his style to let something like that slide. If he did, then everyone would just line up to take advantage of it. He cringed internally. Especially the younger crew. That's how he came to the decision to teach his wayward girlfriend a small lesson in playing with the big boys. So here he was driving like a mad man, which, according to her wasn't unusual at any rate. But the fact he was doing it on purpose and in her SS is what kept prompting these wonderful muttered tidbits of her perception of his character and the dark, demented smirk that was now permanently tattooed across his lips. As he rounded a corner a little too quickly, she finally decided to stop muttering and start shouting. Honestly, you'd think that the oncoming fuel truck had almost hit them or something the way she kept looking to the retreating truck and him. He'd had inches of clearance, so why was she screaming anyway? Finally, she had enough as he flew threw a yellow light and came close to popping the curb as he made another 70+MPH turn to get to the back service road to Otto's. As soon as they were off of the main roads, she leveled her darkest look at him, though today it was actually menacing as she ground out through closed teeth, \"Stop. The. Fucking. Car. Sphinx. NOW .\" He pulled onto the shoulder before turning and looking at her, brow raised. Chaosia, to her credit, didn't do anything but unbuckle her seat belt and get out of the car. She walked around to the driver's side and opened the door, very calmly telling him, \"Out and in the other side.\" He did so, not even bothering to protest as she sat and laid her head on the steering wheel. Finally, after she'd felt she contained herself enough; she started the car and brought the engine of her Chevelle roaring to life. She put her seat belt back on, not bothering to tell him to do the same as she turned, giving him a deadpan look as she informed him \"Very funny, Mister Sphinx. But nowhere near as funny as what's going to happen next.\" And with that small warning, she pulled the car back onto the service road and floored the accelerator, never touching the clutch as she shifted to the next gear and made both the speedometer and RPMs climb well into the red. She never once looked at him as she turned, practically drifting into Otto's lot in a spray of gravel and exhaust, coming mere centimeters from Tumbler, Kip, Donnie and Memphis as she stopped. Sphinx just looked at her like she was crazy as she killed the engine and got out, straightening the knee length flowing turquoise skirt before grabbing her bag from the backseat and starting towards the sounds of the get together, head held high. She flipped her hair over her shoulder as she called out to the stunned group, \"You'll need to step away from the car before he can get out, boys.\" Donnie, regaining his sense after almost being run over, opens the door for their stoic friend to get out of the car. No one dared to say a word until Memphis looked at his brother and practically crowed, \"I told you she drives like a bat out of hell! But oh, no! No one believes me until we all almost get run over.\" Kip rolled his eyes, taking a drink of his beer while Tumbler just looked after Chaosia in a daze. Donnie patted Sphinx's shoulder, offering him the rest of his beer as he man stepped away from the car and closed the door before draining it. \"Brother, what did you do? There is no way she drives like that all of the time.\" Sphinx looked to Donnie as Mikhail came out of the garage, looking for them. He took one look at Sphinx and shook his head. \"Man, whatever argument you are in do not mess with that car or she'll sling you in floorboards every time.\" The stoic man just looked after Chaosia, bewildered while the others just laughed and started towards the food and beer. Sway wanted to say that she couldn't believe Chaosia was capable of causing the slightly green tint Sphinx was sporting at the moment, but after riding to the spa with her, she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the girl could and would make the seasoned boost eat crow if he tested her. Which is what led to their current conversation. \"So, what did he do to warrant that stunt? I could hear you sliding in back here, you know.\" Chaosia, for all of her sweet nature and caring attitude, leveled a glare in Sphinx's direction that had even Atley considering shying away from her. She glowered, pulling her white and turquoise track jacket off to showcase the white lacey top and brown studded belt with the huge turquoise belt buckle that was slung low on her hips. The racer back shirt allowed a great view of her tanned skin and a good portion of her phoenix tattoo to be visible while hiding the majority of the scarring. The belt matched the brown leather flip-flops she was wearing and the cord necklace with the single freshwater pearl. Sway shook her head as, even with her pissed at him for whatever reason, she noticed Sphinx still managed to keep an eye on his girl (discretely of course). \"He drove my car like a bat out of hell, that's what he did. And for what? I mean all I did was tidy up his apartment and start a freaking load of laundry. There was no need for him to practically run us into a fuel truck to prove a damn point! He'll be lucky if I ever set foot back in his damned house much less offer to help him clean it.\" Sway smirked, noticing the dark glower that the silent man had taken on. So he was listening. She nudged Atley, who looked, comprehended and smiled evilly before going to goad Sphinx into apologizing. Chaosia, however just turned and snubbed him, blatantly ignoring him and his glower as she proceeded to talk to Sway and Junie about her portfolio class and her soccer team. Junie was amazed that Chaosia was an art student and practically begged her to bring her sketches next time they got together as the three of them set the table. Chaosia was agreeing when she noticed there was enough food to feed several small armies . . . and that a rather dark shadow had fallen over her as she set down a plate of hotwings. She glanced back, seeing Sphinx standing behind her. She raised a brow before he nodded his head in the direction of the paint dock, silently asking for a moment. She sighed, sitting the plate to the side and followed him, not letting him see how nervous she was as he slid the door closed behind them. She turned, looking up at him as he came to stand in front of her. \"Well?\" His arms went around her waist, pulling her into his chest. She stiffened at first, and then just sighed as she leaned into him, laying her head on his shoulder. \"I guess this is as close to a formal apology for the guy moment earlier as I get, isn't it?\" He shook his head before resting his chin on the top of her hair. \"No, I think you'll get a proper one at home . . . if you'll set foot in it, that is.\" Chaosia smiled, \"I'll consider it. Does it involve white chocolate or just us and a bed?\" He smirked, tilting her face up to his. \"I was thinking just us and the bed. Don't tell me you'd rather have the chocolate . . .\" She stopped, pretending to think before kissing him, quickly. \"I guess you and me and your bed will do, this time.\" He quirked a brow as she shook her head. \"Oh, seriously. We are both too hard headed to ever live in complete harmony. We're going to fight and bitch and bicker. It's just a fact of life. But white chocolate and great make-up sex can insure that we only fight for the right reasons.\" He looked skyward, groaning. \"I am almost terrified to ask, but what are the right reasons, then?\" She grinned, leaning and whispering, \"Because one of us needs to hear what the other is saying or to be able to make up of course.\" He shook his head, stepping back to let her go as they turned to walk back out, having settled their disagreement. She stopped, looking up at him with puppy dog eyes asking, \"Does this mean you're going to sit beside me, now?\" He swatted her shoulder before rolling his eyes and throwing an arm over her shoulders. Before he opened the door, he dipped down and kissed her hair leaving her giggling. She knew that that little show of affection would be the last one before they went back to their building. And honestly, she didn't think it was necessarily a bad thing. Some of the guys her and Mikhail's age seemed pretty immature. She could only imagine the carnage that would ensue if one of them made the kissy faces or smooching noises that some of the other soccer players made at Orsinio every time his girlfriend came to see practice. She grinned, watching as Sphinx stepped away and started to pull the paint dock door open. Actually the ass beating that would follow would be funny to watch as long as she didn't have to fix the mess he made. A series of shouts and loud thumps broke her from her thoughts as Atley and Sway spilled into the paint dock, Memphis and Mikhail jumping back and almost knocking Donnie over to act like they weren't part of the eavesdropping fiasco. Sphinx glowered at the group while Chaosia laughed, shaking her head as she stepped over the co-conspirators and went to the table to get a seat and a beer. Her boyfriend definitely had loyal, nosey friends even if he didn't think he want them. Sphinx was glaring at Mirror for the millionth time since Chaosia sat down. Apparently, the younger boost's earlier hang ups about Mikhail's sister had gone the wayside and he was determined to grill the girl about everything he could. Sphinx knew better than most that the boy was testing boundaries, both Chaosia's and his own. \"So what's it like to sleep with a serial killer?\" Normally, he would let whoever peaked the boy's interest hold their own so long as he didn't overstep his bounds, but seeing as how Mirror was intent on seeing if he could make Chaosia blush and the throbbing vein on Mikhail's forehead pop, maybe and intervention wouldn't be seen as too sappy. Sphinx opened his mouth, knowing that usually whatever he said would bring the group to their wits for a moment, when Chaosia turned to him and ended all of it with one statement. \"I think he was talking to you, Sphinx. God, you just couldn't keep quiet about the body count contest could you?\" Tumbler sprayed Kip and Memphis with his beer as Atley dropped the hotwing he'd been holding. Donnie was rolling laughing as Sway handed Memphis a roll of paper towels, chuckling. Sphinx, looked at her, brow raised before he smirked and shrugged. \"It was too impressive to keep a secret, Love.\" Mirror looked about ready to shit himself, but Sphinx honestly didn't know it was because of the joke or the fact that he was smiling. Finally, the younger boost regained his sense and a huge grin split his face. He looked to Mikhail and Sphinx, nodding once as he intoned, \"She's cool. I guess I can hand over the 'aggravate Sphinx' keys to her.\" Chaosia smiled, looking up at Sphinx in a way that almost made him want to fidget. She looked back at Mirror, her grin turning dark. \"Oh don't worry. There is plenty of Sphinx to annoy. I don't mind sharing.\" Mirror nodded before proceeding to steal a piece of pound cake from Freb's plate, causing a huge ruckus. The entire group laughed as Freb tried to chase Mirror around, only to be tripped by Otto's behemoth of a dog. Kip and Tumbler ended up saving him as the others started clearing the dishes. Junie, in true mother hen fashion, started passing out huge plates of leftovers. By time to leave, Sphinx and Chaos had two huge plates of cake and a tray of wings with a cup of ranch and bleu cheese a piece, all in reusable grocery totes and ready to be carried to their respective homes. Junie smiled, handing both bags to Chaosia. \"Now don't let him forget to put those wings in the fridge or I swear they'll kill him. I don't know if he's as bad as Otto about that but . . . better safe than sorry.\" Chaosia laughed, hugging Junie as best she could and whispering, \"No matter what he wants everyone to think, he's still a guy, Junie. They're all forgetful to an extent, just like us.\" Junie laughed, winking. \"But they're the ones who make us go crazy and forget.\" Chaos nodded, grinning as she watched Mirror suddenly jump up and hug Sphinx for no reason other than to antagonize the usually sinister man. She tried not to laugh at the quick look of horror that crossed his features before they darkened into something worthy of fearing. Mikhail laughed as Mirror jumped away and hid behind Sway, who was trying to talk sense into the playful idiot. \"Dude, he's going to kill you one day. Mark my words.\" Mikhail nodded, still chuckling, \"Yeah, Mirror. Plus Ripley might just try to gut you herself for hanging all over her boyfriend. She's the jealous type, you know?\" Chaosia rolled her eyes as the others laughed or smiled; knowing he'd probably told them some outrageously exaggerated story or another. She walked over to her boyfriend, handing him a bag as he glared at Mirror. \"Here, Sphinx. Junie's sending both of us home with enough food for days.\" He nodded, accepting the tote while never letting Mirror out of his sights. The younger boost was starting to squirm and try to completely disappear behind the now cackling Sway. Chaos finally took pity on the poor guy as she swatted Sphinx's chest, drawing his attention away. He looked down at her, brow raised. She, however, was not the least bit deterred. \"Stop glaring at him before you set him on fire, goofball. He just hugged you. Sheesh. I'm glad you didn't glare at me like that when I hugged you for the first time.\" His quizzical expression turned sour as he rolled his eyes and went back to glare at Mirror, who was now gone from the immediate area. Chaos smiled, looping her arm around his waist. \"C'mon, big boy . Let's go home. You can torture Mirror and his friends next time.\" Sway stopped laughing, knowing that she was about to witness a murder. Sphinx was giving Chaos a look that had her brother and Atley edging a little closer in case the stoic boost forgot himself. He wasn't exactly renowned for his patience and letting people tease him go unpunished. Sphinx surprised them all by shaking his head and throwing his free arm over her shoulders, pulling her closer. Memphis looked about ready to faint while Kip and Tumbler watched in this kind of horrified awe. Together, standing together the way they were, it was easy to see just how much bigger Sphinx was than Chaos. She barely came to his shoulder; her light feminine clothes making her seem even more petite against his much darker presence. Chaos however just smiled contentedly up at him while he looked down at her with a mixture of irritation and fondness. Junie broke the silence that had settled in the display of affection's wake by coming back out to get something and spotting them. She sighed, smiling at the two. \"Aww! You two are absolutely adorable! Aren't they, Sway?\" At the dark look Sphinx leveled on her, Sway shook her head furiously. \"Nope, they're both down right terrifying . I mean if she can get him to do that then what else can she do?\" Chaosia and Junie shared a look, rolling their eyes in unison before Chaos looked back up at her once again brooding beau. \"Okay, Broody . Let's go before you kill someone.\" He shrugged, disentangling himself and taking her bag, heading to the car as she hugged her brother and Junie goodbye. She turned to Sway. \"Do you want to go with me shopping tomorrow? I'm off and I need to get a few things for my apartment.\" Sway nodded, knowing that it would be fun to go and traipse around Long Beach with Chaos for a day. \"Sure, but I'll drive.\" Chaos laughed, muttering good naturedly about weak stomached boosts as she made her way to her SS. She tossed Sphinx, who was standing with Otto, Memphis, Donnie and Atley, the keys. \"Try not to kill us this time, please ? I'd like to live to make it home.\" He shrugged, nodding to the group before heading to the car. As he brought the engine to life, Chaos waved to the others. When the Chevelle SS pealed out of the drive, Otto was the first to start chuckling. Soon enough all four were laughing so hard tears were running down their faces. When Sway and Junie came out, leaving the younger crew to gather the trash (since they'd barely helped clean dishes and food), they looked at them like they were crazy. Finally Sway, not one to be left in the dark for anything, asked, \"What is so damned funny?\" Otto stopped, wiping away a tear as he explained what had happened. Junie and Sway, however, were not amused. \"So, Otto? When I'm ready to go, you usually do about the same thing. What's so wrong with him doing that for her?\" Memphis looked at Sway, trying to get her to see their point without coming out and saying it. Finally, Atley shook his head, explaining. \"The Sphinx has never worked on anyone else's time schedule but his own, even in boosting. So it was kind of funny to see him, one of the scariest bastards any of us has ever known, going right along with what a pretty little girl in a pretty little skirt asked. Especially after the little scene in there.\" Sway however, wasn't buying it. She suddenly knew what was so funny and to her it wasn't, it was fucking hilarious. \"You mean it's funny to see him whipped like Otto and Memphis.\" Donnie smiled, nodding. \"Exactly! Who'd have ever guessed, huh?\" Sway and Junie shook their heads. \"Well, leave him alone. No ribbing him or poking fun. Just because he listens to her , which to let you know isn't normally the case, doesn't mean he won't still send you to the morgue for testing his nerves.\" Junie nodded. \"Besides, I think its sweet he has someone who lets him be himself. It's rare to see someone who's willing to make the compromises she'll undoubtedly have to for him . . .\" Atley nodded, agreeing. The other three males present watched as Atley transformed from the antifreeze veined boost to a regular chatterbox and plethora of unknown information. \"Yeah, but he's already starting to change small things for her. I don't think he knew he'd done that earlier until you said something, Junie. I swear it's the closest to a human emotion I've seen on his face in years.\" Otto and Memphis both rolled their eyes, Donnie good naturedly voicing their shared thought. \"Oh really? He's changed something for her? Like what? Not bringing home dead bodies at all hours of the night?\" Atley stopped, looking around to make sure none of the younger crew, including Mikhail, was listening. \"I swear, if you breathe a word of this, I'll let him kill you all. Got it ?\" All heads nodded as they huddled, eager for the tidbit of gossip Atley was so ever willing to deliver. Apparently, his ability to notice the interaction between the new couple had been vastly under rater and appreciated. A folly the group swore to correct in the foreseeable future. Especially seeing as in despite Chaosia's friendly and talkative nature, she could be as close lipped about her budding romance as her boyfriend. \"The night she moved, I stayed just to be closer and make sure he didn't do anything too outrageous. Well, he thought he'd hurt her feelings, right? He apologizes to her and then sits and ignores the game we were watching. To make a long story short, when she got up in the middle of the night, I was awake. She stopped and made sure he was okay, since he was hanging half way off the couch. When she woke him up though, first thing he asked was if she was okay and what was wrong. He was worried about her right off the bat.\" Sway and Junie both looked at Atley, obviously downplaying the severity of that tidbit as the guys shared differently displayed but common thoughts. Otto nodded, smirking. Memphis looked at him like he was spouting some impossible lie and Donnie whistled, shaking his head. Finally, Sway had to ask. \"What? What does that mean, oh knowledgeable men?\" Atley smirked as Otto explained, \"It means, honey, that he's in deep and doesn't even notice. For her to take precedent over so many other things that could have happened . . . it means a lot. Especially for someone like Sphinx.\" Sway and Junie rolled their eyes, leaving the men to their gossip. \"Sure boys.\" \"Uh huh. Okay, Otto, whatever you say. Just leave them alone!\" Okay. I seriously have guy friends who gossip way worse than any women I know so turning Atley and crew into that for a small moment was too good to pass up. Hope you like it. Later![Chapter 12] Thanks so much for the reviews and encouragement. Especially you, Inferno. So the sweet moment later is specially for. DISCLAIMER: I OWN NOTHING SAVE THE OCCASIONAL ORIGINAL CHARACTER AND AN OLD SS THAT EATS ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME IN GAS! Dressing Up to Tear it Down Chaos looked at her reflection for the millionth time in the past five minutes. The black party dress was a far cry from what she normally wore but it was pretty. An over the shoulder number, the satin cocktail dress fit like a second skin, showing off the figure she worked so hard to keep in shape. The tanning salon hours that she and Sway had been putting in had paid off as well, leaving her a nice, even honeydew tone rather than her normal peaches and cream complexion. She turned, admiring the way the asymmetrical cut of the top covered the scars on her back and left the phoenix tattoo bare for the world to see. She smirked. The tattoo on her back was her own guilty pleasure, a treat to herself for living to see the age of twenty two . . . Now, three years later, the tattoo was just as precious as it was when the needle first touched her skin, but for oh so different reasons. Her boyfriend loved it, too. So that was definitely a plus. Speaking of her boyfriend . . . She turned, watching the satin skirt shimmer. Sphinx was going to die when he came to get her in an hour. He'd never seen her in a dress. Oh sure, they'd only been dating a little over two weeks but still. She sighed, sitting down on her bed to put on her shoes. She'd scared Sway to death when they'd gone shopping and she'd grabbed the red snakeskin leather stilettos. But seriously, three inch Jimmy Choo's at that price was a hard thing to turn down. She shook her head. She was spending way too much time with Paul these days for his habits to have worn off on her that badly. But she did love the shoes. Besides, they matched the red lingerie she was wearing under the dress. She got up, going to pour herself a glass of wine while she waited. If she was going to be subjected to this then she was going to at least have a decent glass of white wine before she went. Chaosia sighed as she let the glass of wine breathe before she took her first sip, contemplating just what and why she was going to be doing later tonight with her boyfriend. Apparently, her darling brother had found a new \"girlfriend\" of sorts and wanted her and Memphis to meet her. Now, normally that would be fine and the elder Raines could meet her one time and then she could meet the girl another. But Mikhail got the oh-so-bright idea in his head to go ahead and make them meet her at the same time without giving a thought to the fact that Sway and Sphinx might take offense to being left out. Well, Sway did anyway. It was with this in mind that Mikhail had gone through the agony and effort to arrange for the six of them to go to some gallery opening tonight. Apparently the new \"girlfriend\" was a photographer and some of her works would be on display. So they were going to that and out to eat at some ritzy restaurant. Which suited her fine but Sphinx. . . Sphinx had to be bribed with breakfast in bed and the promise of a very happy ending to even consider going. And when he found out he was going to have to wear a suit, he'd adamantly refused. Chaosia had had to practically beg him and swear to cook for him twice in the upcoming week on top of the breakfast in bed. And he got to pick the movie the next time they went out. She sighed, draining the glass in one go before going to put on her lipstick. She and Sway would both be sporting red lips this evening, though for different reasons. Apparently, Sway wanted to go all girlie to prove she could . . . while Chaosia personally picked the color because it matched her shoes and the ruby and diamond cluster cocktail ring and earrings she'd chosen to wear. A knock on the door brought her out of the back of her apartment. She almost went to the patio door and then she stopped, going to the main entrance. She was so used to Sphinx coming in that door that going to answer the other for anyone was almost odd . She opened the door wide, allowing Sway and Memphis to enter her home, the former grinning like a Cheshire cat. Sway had gone to Paul's and had her hair combed out and curled then pile loosely in a ponytail at the back of her head, a waterfall of platinum curls falling down her back. Her own dress was a knee length brilliant blue strapless sheath dress with a sweetheart bodice. She was wearing blue satin heels and simple diamond earrings. Her make-up was what caught Chaos's eye though. Classic and almost natural save the dark rimming around her now black lashes and shiny red gloss on her pouty lips. Memphis was dressed in navy blue slacks and a white dress shirt, a navy jacket over his arm. He was at ease in his attire where she could tell Sway was fighting to be comfortable, though no one who didn't know the woman would spot it. She grinned, motioning to the couch. \"Go ahead and have a seat. Sphinx will be here any minute, I'm sure and then we can head out. Do you guys want anything to drink?\" Sway nodded as Memphis said, \"A beer if you have one. I doubt they'll serve any at this gallery.\" Chaos chuckled as she brought two beers to the living room, passing them to booth boosts. She turned to Memphis, winking. \"So, do you like Sway's dress?\" Memphis nodded, kissing Sway's hair before leaning back and into Chaosia's couch to preen about his girlfriend. \"Yep. She's gorgeous. I keep telling her that it's not too short but she doesn't believe me.\" Sway swatted his shoulder, rolling her eyes. \"You wouldn't tell me if it was. You're too damn thrilled I'm in the damn thing to say something to mess it up, Raines.\" Memphis shrugged as if saying \"true\" which had all three laughing. A knock on the door brought Chaos to her feet to answer and the other two anticipating what would happen next. Memphis himself was curious to see his close lipped friend in something other than his work clothes or jeans. When he walked through the door, however, even Memphis did a double take. Sphinx was wearing a black suit that had been tailored to fit with a black collared shirt beneath it. The only color in the whole ensemble was a red tie that matched Chaosia's shoes and accessories. She smiled, blushing as he stepped into the room, looking her up and down. He held out a hand to her, keeping the other behind his back as he let her step into him; dipping his lips to press them against her cheek. She smiled, running a hand down his chest, playing with his tie. \"You look great, honey. I might start making you wear suits more often. What took you so long anyway?\" He smirked, raking his eyes over her as he leaned in, pulling the single long stem red rose from behind his back and holding it for her to take. She smiled, accepting it with a blush nearly as dark as the flower. \"Sorry, Lovely. I had to change at the office to make it on time.\" He kissed her cheek, whispering in her ear, \"You look ravishing , Love. Can't we just skip this bloody thing and stay in?\" She blushed darker, loving how he looked at her and barely even noticed the other people in the room. Apparently, Sway and Memphis were going to get to see some of his sweet side tonight . . . Speaking of which . . . \"No, honey. But we do need to go or we're going to be late. And not have any fun to cause it, either. Guys? Are you riding with us or driving separate?\" Memphis, still in a daze from seeing the Sphinx with suits and rose, just nodded while Sway rolled her eyes, elbowing him. He shook himself. \"We're taking Eleanor. I'll follow you there . . . Sphinx is driving right?\" It was Chaosia's turn to roll her eyes as Sphinx chuckled darkly at his crew leader. He knew that keeping up with his Chaos was a task that could keep event a seasoned boost busy. \"I am, Memphis.\" Memphis started, not used to hearing Sphinx while Sway practically drug him out of the apartment, shouting they'd be waiting in the garage. As soon as the door closed, Sphinx turned and scooped Chaosia up into a fierce kiss, forcing her to wrap her arms around him just to help support her suspiciously weak knees. As they parted, she wiped her red lipstick from his lips, smiling up at him. Maybe they could just forgo this fiasco and spend the night dancing here and then undressing one another . . . She shook herself mentally, forcing herself to remember her surprise for him tonight. \"Guess what? I went by Dad's earlier with Paul and I got something cool for tonight.\" He looked down at her, a dark smirk spread across his lips as he quirked a brow at her in an Oh really way. She nodded, producing a set of silver keys. \"We're borrowing my Dad's Aston for the evening, complete with Diplomatic plates to prevent any unfortunate speed tickets should we have to escape in a hurry.\" Sphinx looked down at her, amazed as she handed him the keys to her father's car. They'd talked about the three Aston Martins the man had stashed at his house in Long Beach for when he was in the States. Apparently her other half siblings weren't even allowed to breathe on the bloody things, but here she was with the keys. \"You told him someone else was driving didn't you?\" She smacked him, grumbling as she disentangled herself to grab her red clutch and red dress coat. \"Yeah, I did. I told him my older boyfriend would be driving and therefore his car would be safe. He said I could keep it as long as my Chevelle was at Otto's under the condition that when he's Stateside next week, you meet us for dinner. I said I'd talk to you about it but I wasn't going to agree to anything for you . . .\" He pocketed the keys, shrugging. He could meet her father. Besides, it'd be nice to spend time with another Englishman. \"Sure, Love. Set a time and place and I'll be there.\" She smiled, kissing his cheek before walking out, letting him shut the door to her apartment as they went. Sphinx was floored. He'd never dreamed that he would get to see an Aston Martin One-77 up close unless it was to boost it. So it was safe to say that the same opinion applied to being able to drive said car. But here, in glittering ebony beneath the light of the parking complex sat an Aston Martin One-77. Memphis had been standing near it when they'd come down, practically drooling. Even if European Ladies weren't his cup of tea, Memphis Raines knew a beautiful lady when he saw one. And Chaosia's replacement car was beautiful. Raines kept looking to Chaos as she and Sway laughed. \"And you can drive it, legally? No boost required? Just gave you the keys and said have fun?\" Chaosia nodded for the third time as Sway cackled. \"Yes Memphis. All I have to do is put gas in it and eat with him and Sphinx next week.\" Memphis looked at Sway. \"Can you two go in Eleanor? Sphinx and I will take this beauty and meet you there.\" Chaosia and Sway shared a look before going to their respective cars and boyfriends. As she and Sphinx got in she smiled. \"You do realize that this thing is going to fly, right? I mean it's got a 7.3 litre V12 in it so . . .just . . . have fun. And don't lose Memphis more than once, okay?\" He smirked, nodding once as he brought the engine roaring to life in time with Eleanor. Chaosia smiled, laughing as she heard Memphis rev his engine. Sphinx pulled out of the complex and into the street, careful of other drivers for once. As they made their way to the gallery, something occurred to him. Sphinx looked at her, brow quirked. \"Does she have a name?\" Her smile turned bittersweet as she looked out the window, watching Long Beach pass by the glass. \"Millennia. My father calls her Millennia, after my mother.\" Sphinx nodded, opting to leave the subject alone as they neared their destination. Chaosia for the life of her could not figure out what the photograph her brother's flavor of the month was gushing over was supposed to be . . . but whatever it was, it was certainly interesting. Sphinx, already armed with a glass of Scotch on the rocks, just kept looking from her to the image like she was an escaped mental patient showing off her finger paintings. Memphis and Sway were apparently under the same impression if the glazed over quality to Memphis's eyes was any indicator. The girl in question was actually pretty and neatly dressed, a far cry from her brother's usual type. Her dark hair was pulled straight and parted to the side, almost covering on of her eyes as it fell to her shoulders. She was wearing a long sleeved black dress that came to her just above her knees. And though the thing fit like it was painted on, it was actually tasteful. Then she turned to talk to someone else and Chaosia had to rethink that opinion. The whole back of the dress was open, barely beginning again at the top of her butt. Chaosia rolled her eyes. Okay, maybe she was more Mikhail's type. Sway looked at her, apparently sharing the opinion. She sighed. The only thing that really bugged her about this girl was the roving eye. Honestly, if Mikhail wasn't her brother than the looks she kept throwing her boyfriend would piss her off enough. This girl- Monica? Morticia? Marsha? Kept eyeing Sphinx and Memphis like they were the main meal and dessert. She'd already touched Memphis once, though he was so zoned out he barely noticed, and she kept throwing these come hither glances at Sphinx. Who was so earning a tray full of brownie points for pointedly ignoring them. Hell, he was practically attached to Chaosia at the hip; always ensuring that they were in some form of visible and intimate contact. He was currently standing beside her with one hand on the small of her back, rubbing small circles with his thumb. She glanced at him, smiling as he rolled his eyes. She giggled, causing him to lean down and kiss the tip of her nose. Mikhail just watched in awe as Sway shook her head at him. He turned to Memphis. \"Have they been like this all night?\" Memphis nodded, leaning in to share gossip. \"Yeah. He brought her a rose before we left and everything. And they keep touching eac-OW! Jesus, Sway! What was that FOR?!\" Sway glared at both men, her clutch purse still brandished like a weapon as she ground out, \"Junie and I told you busy bodies to leave them ALONE! That means period.\" Both nodded as Chaosia looked at them puzzled. \"Is everything okay?\" Mikhail quick to try and cover their meddling, answered before thinking. \"Oh, Sway's just temperamental because she's on her period. You know how crazy you broads get when the crimson tide rolls in.\" Chaos glared as Sway proceeded to cuff Mikhail on the back of the head, then hit Memphis for snickering. The girl – Monique! That's her name!- just giggled, linking her arm through Mikhail's and petting his abused head. \"Oh, honey. It's okay. You just don't need to aggravate her if you know it that time of the month. We can be testy .\" Sway rolled her eyes, cuffing Memphis again for snickering at the idiots. Lord this was going to be a long night! By the time the group had eaten dinner, Sphinx was about ready to kill Mikhail for subjecting them to this. Seriously, the boy needed to think with the head on his shoulders and not the one in his pants. The only good thing that could come out of this was that if he was too busy with this trollop then he couldn't interfere with your and Chaosia's comings and goings, boy-o. This Monique character was pretty in a plastic way but she wasn't anything compared to what he was going home with as soon as the checks came. Chaosia, with her tousled curls and red lips was the epitome of grace and beauty tonight. Especially in that dress and those heels. Lord, they needed to get the checks taken care of so he could drive that wonderful car (a great bonus for the evening) and get her to one of their respective apartments and bed to take off that dress. He was debating on whether or not to ask her to keep the heels on when Monique spoke up, breaking his train of concentration. \"So, Mr. Sphinx. How long have you and Ripley been together?\" He turned, confused for a moment before remembering that Chaosia's middle name was what her brother usually called her by. He looked at his own girlfriend, smirking. \"It'll be three weeks Saturday. Right, Love?\" Chaosia, to her credit blushed and nodded, taking a rather long drink of her wine. He was suddenly glad he was driving, seeing as in the Scotch at the gallery had been his only drink. Chaosia, on the other hand, had killed a bottle and a half in an attempt to keep silent and friendly to Monique. A strategy that would lose it's effectiveness if the alcohol hit her system when she was aggravated. Monique looked confused, glancing between them. \"Really? That it? I swear you two act like you've been together forever or something . How'd you two meet?\" \"We bumped into each other at a coffee shop. Literally. He ended up wearing my drink and cake home. I gave him my number so he could call if his coat didn't get clean.\" Chaosia smiled as she gave a very condensed group friendly version of their meeting. Monique turned to Mikhail. \"So are you okay with that? I mean, he's hot, yeah. But he's so much older than her . . .I mean you're what, twenty one at the most?\" Chaosia's features darkened and her brother started to squirm. Sphinx knew he had nothing on her when she hit this mood. She'd even sent Atley cowering with the look she was leveling on Monique. And the girl was absolutely oblivious. \"I'll be twenty six this year, honey . And while there is an age difference between us, it's none of anyone else's business but ours .\" Monique looked stunned but nodded as Mikhail shook his head. So much for that. As the waitress dropped off the checks (about twenty minutes too late to salvage this outing), Sphinx dropped the cash for their meal and the tip. He turned, gathering up his coat as Chaosia did the same. She hugged Mikhail, who whispered his apologies as they parted and he shook Sphinx's hand. She shrugged it off, smiling at everyone before they left. When they got to the car, she stopped looking up at him. \"Does it bother you? That I'm younger?\" He stopped floored by the question. He thought about it and gave her an honest answer. \"Less than it bothers me that you're Mikhail's sister, which isn't much at all if you recall. There are times that the age difference between us is going to make things odd and there are times it'll help. I really don't care about how old you are, Love, so long as it's legal for us to see one another.\" She smiled before continuing. \"Honestly? You don't think I'm some stupid kid or weirdo?\" He sighed, pulling her to him. Now he knew that this was just as much the wine talking as her insecurities brought to light by the plastic idiot. \"Not in the least. Do you think I'm perverse for wanting you ?\" She smirked, batting her eyelashes at him. \"Does this mean I'm not your trophy girlfriend?\" He laughed, shaking his head as he ushered her to the car. \"Only if it means I'm not your Sugar Daddy , Love.\" They laughed all the way back to the apartment. Chaosia knew that as soon as she finished what she'd set out to do, she was going to write a very nasty email to every screenwriter and director she could find. Honestly, they make it look so damned easy for the girl to unlock and open her door while she's got her arms and lips full of some gorgeous hunk. As she let the keys hang in the lock to wrap her arms around Sphinx broad shoulders and deepen their already intense kiss, she knew now that those actresses were good at their jobs of making it look easy. Sphinx pulled on hand away from her hips, quickly reaching out and turning the key to unlock the door and push it open. She smiled up at him, warm and tingling from both the wine and his kisses. Seriously, for someone who hated to talk, he was extremely good at using his mouth when he wanted to be. She stepped back into her home, watching him lean against the door frame and smirk down at her. \"Do you want to come in?\" He stopped, pretending to think about the offer. Chaosia, in no mood for his wicked sense of humor, grabbed his lapels and pulled him in, laughing as he kicked the door shut before slashing his lips across her again. She was thankful that the heels gave her some height, so this was actually easier on her that usual. As they kissed, his hands pulled up the hem of her dress, brushing the red lace beneath. He stopped, obviously intrigued by what he'd just felt. He hooked a finger through the lacey cheeky panties, groaning as he saw the red matched the heels. She giggled, pulling away and walking down the hall, sliding the dress over her head as she went. He watched her, amazed before following her. She stopped at the door to the bedroom, leaning up to kiss him. \"Do you like it?\" He looked down, taking in the red corset with the black lace and the matching lace panties. He nodded, covering her hips with his hands. \"I love it, Love. Red definitely suits you.\" She smiled, kissing him softly before stepping back and into the bedroom, allowing him to enter before shutting the door. \"I told you you'd like what I was wearing out tonight, Big Boy.\" He smirked, pulling her into bed with him as he nodded his agreement. He cupped her cheek, kissing her lips before telling her. \"No more talking, Love. Let's just enjoy the peace and quiet.\" She laughed, kissing his jaw down to his throat and nipping at his Adam's apple. \"Hopefully not too quiet.\" Good Lord! Three chapters in just two days! I'm about to stroke out. If you're curious about the Aston Martin One-77 , check it out online. A beautiful car for a date between Sphinx and Chaos. Anyways, hope you enjoyed it. Later![Chapter 13] Okay, this chapter gets back to some of the boosting and away from the silly stuff. Hope you like it. Thanks for the reviews and the support. It means the world. Boosting and Anatomy 101 Sphinx worked quietly on getting the 69 Roadrunner to crank, mentally listing the things he needed to do to get it running. All that was left was to stick the thin metal piece into the ignition and it should start. Even with all of the damage to the wiring in the steering column. Jesus, those two idiots had all but fumbled this boost but good. He sighed. Atley and Mikhail were now the designated keepers of Tumbler and Kip. And though both were excellent boosts in their own right, Tumbler had convinced the younger Raines brother to start teaching Toby to boost. Which wasn't that big of a deal, but the boy knew next to nothing about cars and the inner workings of them. Oh, he knew computers like they were nothing, and had shown the crew how to reprogram a car's computer and the chip to negate Governors and GPS locaters alike . . . but they really needed to start the boy on something around the shop or one of their own vehicles before they sent him out to do a proper boost. Because something like this could and would happen. Toby, to his credit, was watching Sphinx work, committing everything his stoic \"mentor\" was doing to memory. Sphinx sighed. He would apparently have to keep a closer eye on the five of them for a while. Though he knew Atley and Mikhail were capable, he really didn't need any of them going to jail because the idiots and the novice got them caught. Besides, Chaosia would kill him if he let he brother go to jail when her brother was due in town in less than seven days. Even if she is still pissed at said brother about the whole fiasco with Monique the night before last. Sphinx smirked to himself as he showed Toby how to crank the motor, hearing and feeling the rumble of the 426 CID Hemi. Toby looked to him, smiling as he nodded. \"Thanks, Sphinx. It means a lot that you came and helped. Tell Chaos I said sorry for interrupting your night.\" Sphinx waved it off; thankful that the boy was at least intelligent enough to realize he'd just had his ass saved. Maybe teaching the kid a thing or two wouldn't be so dreadful. He didn't really chatter away like the others. He was actually kind of quiet and reserved unless it was about computers. . . \"Oh thank God, he got it to start. See Tumbler. That's why you let the people who know how to do something do it and don't tear out half of the damn steering column. What were you two thinking?\" Sphinx rolled his eyes, watching Kip and Tumbler dip their heads and shrug as Atley tore into them. Mikhail, ever practical, nudged Atley. \"Hey, let's finish this at the shop. Okay? We've been here a while and the neighbors are bound to be suspicious by now. Let's go.\" Atley nodded, throwing Toby a look. \"You ride with Sphinx. Watch how he drives the thing and remember it. He's the best with muscle and classics for a reason.\" He turned, cuffing the muttering Tumbler in the back of the head as he got into Mikhail's carbon black Escalade. The younger boost yelped as Kip snickered. \"Shut up, both of you. Memphis is going to have kittens when he hears about this. You know how he feels about you idiots boosting close to home. Even if it is educational.\" As the Escalade pulled off, Sphinx shook his head and got in the Roadrunner with Toby following suit. At least the boy had taste. On the drive back to the garage, Sphinx's phone went off, Staind's Pressure filling the cabin of the car. He sighed. Chaosia hadn't been happy when she'd been asked to change her ringtone. But after hearing about the incident in the morgue, she'd relented and picked the older rock song out as a big joke. He hadn't liked it one bit when he heard it at work the next day, but he got the joke. Toby looked at him amazed as he answered the phone, but Chaos hadn't been feeling well when her brother drug him out of her apartment. She'd woken up with a migraine bad enough that she had only gone to class and called off her practice scrimmage before coming back to her home and holing up on her couch until he'd gotten off work to join her. \"Yes, Chaos?\" She snorted, causing him to grin. She hated it when he did that and he knew it. \" Did you save their asses or do I need to start pulling money out of savings for bail?\" He chuckled, noticing that the rookie was about to die. Poor lad honestly looked like he'd stepped into the Twilight Zone with the way he was staring at him. Better keep this shorter than usual. \"Yeah, Love. Got the lad Toby with me now.\" Chaos, quick on the uptake snickered quietly. \"Oh, well let me let you go since you have your reputation as a bad ass to protect. I'd hate for them to think you say more than eight words a year. Oh wait. You don't say more than eight words a year do you? Unless we're in bed, that is.\" He snorted, planning to make her eat those words when he got back. \"Don't need to. You talk enough for both of us.\" She chuckled, knowing she was in trouble and not sounding a bit like she cared. \"Look, I've got to call Dad back but I wanted to check on you. Tell Toby I said hey before you go all silent again. I'll see you later, Sphinx. Miss you.\" He nodded, taking the turn onto the back service road. \"Will do, Love. Miss you too.\" With that, he shut the phone, glancing at Toby. The boy was still shocked at seeing him talk. Lord, maybe he needed to start talking more if this was the reaction he was going to get every time he had something to say . . . NO . Let them worry about the rest. He'd talk when he felt like it and the rest of them could kiss his ass. \"Chaos said hello.\" Toby snapped out of it, nodding as he sat up straighter in his seat, looking out the window to see the garage coming into sight. And the Escalade already parked with the others waiting. He looked back to Sphinx, sighing. Sphinx raised a brow at the boy, silently asking for him to elaborate on the despondent look on his face. Toby cleared his throat. \"I don't know if I'm cut out for this but Tumbler insists on it. He says that it'll just make me feel more at home with the whole crew if I understood what they were always doing and talking about.\" He shrugged, but continued. \"Kip almost had a panic attack when Tumbler told him what he was planning . . . but Tumbler has this way of getting you to agree to what he wants you to do and make you feel okay about it. I guess not even the infamous Raines brothers are immune when Tumbler really wants something. It's just insulting that Kip still thinks I need to be babysat. I mean, I know I got shot but for goodness sakes, it was so long ago and I want to at least try to learn now that Tumbler's offered.\" Sphinx just shrugged, pulling the car in beside the Escalade but not getting out. He turned to Toby, knowing that if Chaos ever got word of what he was about to do, he would never live it down. She would gloat for weeks about how she knew he was a decent person and he cared about other people. Yeah, right. He just didn't want to hear the boy whine or deal with repercussions of a low self-esteemed boost on a future heist. \"Look, lad. They'll coddle you forever if you let them. If you want to learn then serve no master save your own ambition. It's your life and they'll either get over it and support you or they won't. If they don't, then you're just cutting away dead weight. Got it?\" Toby nodded, feeling better as he saw the others looking at the car expectantly. He looked to Sphinx. This was the second time that the stoic boost had helped him feel at ease over something the others were torn and tip toed around. When he'd gotten shot, Sphinx's first words to the rejoicing crew had helped to take the spotlight off of his injury and allow him the peace of mind that someone else saw it as something to take pride in. He'd survived and his injury (while painful and horrific at first) had helped the other members of the younger crew see that boosting was serious and help get Kip under control. Now, he'd told him to do what he thought was right and follow what he wanted. \"Hey, Sphinx? Thanks.\" The silent boost nodded, opening the door and getting out leaving Toby to do the same as the others approached the car. Otto came out of the garage, shaking his head. \"I called Manday's and he said to drop it by. He had a long standing order for one of these bad boys anyway. Memphis and Kip are going to run it with Atley and me following to bring them back. Toby?\" The boy looked up, listening eagerly as Memphis walked out of the garage looking darkly at Kip and Tumbler. It was apparent that their leader was not thrilled about this. \"Yes sir?\" Otto sighed, motioning him to the parked Jeep beside Mikhail's Escalade. \"You're going too. This was your boost after all. The payoff is yours to do with as you see fit. But you have to go collect it.\" He nodded, waving to Sphinx before getting in the SUV. Sphinx nodded once to Memphis and Atley before going to get in Mikhail's vehicle with him. The boy had to take him back to his apartment. He'd been so frantic when t they'd called him earlier he hadn't even let Sphinx get his car. He'd just come running up to Chaos's apartment and practically grabbed him off of the couch. He'd yelled to Chaos that they'd be back soon and left, dragging Sphinx with him. Now as they went to make their way back to the apartment, Mikhail actually looked sheepish as he looked at the larger boost. \"Is she still mad at me for Monique?\" Sphinx gave him a deadpan look before nodding his head once. Mikhail groaned, laying his head back momentarily before returning his eyes to the road. \"Of course she's still pissed. Damn it . I told Monique not to say anything to Ripley. Period. She already hates it when I date anyway.\" Sphinx looked at him like he was crazy but refused to get drawn into another conversation. What was he? Everybody's sounding board? The shrink of the Long Beach boosts? Well thank you, bloody well no! He rolled his eyes, turning his head to look out the window as Mikhail continued to grumble making the fifteen minute ride to his complex seemed to take an hour. Chaosia opened the main door to her apartment, letting her weary and aggravated boyfriend in before almost shutting the door on her annoying half-brother. She looked at him, brow raised at his attire. Did these people think that dressing in all black made them seem cool or something? The Old School always wore darker but casual non-descript clothing to boost, Sphinx had even explained that it helped even him blend in around a mark to not look out of place in all black. Mikhail, however, seemed to have adopted Kip and Tumbler's habit of dressing in all black for a job, which made him look more like some punk rocker than a car boost. She shook her head, opening the door wide as she said, \"Come on in, goober.\" He shuffled past her, dropping his black zip up jacket on the arm of the couch before flopping onto it, feet thrown up on the coffee table. Sphinx watched, amazed as Chaosia's face darkened and she smacked him. \"Boots off the table jackass. I am not cleaning whatever you stepped in off my table again.\" He grumbled, closing his eyes as he kicked his boots off then put his socked feet up, sticking his tongue out at her. She glared but shook her head, going into the kitchen to get them something to drink. When she returned, Sphinx was stretched out along her sofa, head tilted back and looking all the world like he was asleep . . . but Mikhail was sitting up straight with his feet down and on the floor, eyeing Sphinx like a scolded kid. She raised a brow and shook her head. She'd find out later. Mikhail accepted the beer, saying thank you loudly before sitting he bottle on a coaster. Chaos stopped, looking at her brother amazed. \"Okay. Who are you and what've you done with my brother?\" Mikhail blushed as Sphinx piped up, eyes still closed. \"The boy is practicing his manners .\" Chaosia turned, knowing her boyfriend definitely had more to do with this than he was letting on. \"Really? Why?\" Sphinx cracked an eye at her, shrugging as she stared at him perplexed. He looked way too innocent. Deciding to let it go, she sat beside Sphinx, settling in laying her head on his shoulder. He dropped his arm around her and snatched up the remote, flipping to find something on the tele worth watching. She sighed, kissing over his heart before closing her eyes. Mikhail watched them, amazed at what he was seeing. He really hadn't gotten to see much of their interaction since they'd been dating; only catching them in public settings and out on the group date the night before last. Chaos was at ease with the Sphinx in a way that he'd never seen her. She was content in the silence that was now dominant in her home, the only sound coming from the TV. Sphinx sat there, his sister almost in his lap, acting like it was normal. Occasionally, his hand would move and twirl in her hair or rub her arm, causing Chaos to snuggle a little closer. He had definitely misinterpreted the kind of affection Chaos had for his older crew member . . . and he didn't know if it was a good thing or not. Especially with the way that Sphinx seemed to return it, in his own weird way. Finally, Sphinx tossed him the remote, nodding his head to the set. Mikhail took the hint scrolling through the menu, which Chaos and Sphinx both refused to use, finding a comedy. As they watched the show, Chaos slept, Sphinx rubbing her back every once in a while when she'd move to get comfortable. Mikhail kept shooting glances to the couple on the couch until he finally had enough. He turned looking to Sphinx. \"How do you feel about my sister?\" Sphinx looked at him like he was crazy then shook his head. He looked down at Chaos, shrugging as he ran a hand through her curls. \"We're together , boy. That should say a lot. Besides, what's it to you?\" Mikhail bristled. He knew he wasn't always the best brother but damn it he would keep Chaosia safe if he could. Sphinx seemed to sense the change in attitude and chuckled darkly. \"Settle, Boy-o. Didn't mean it anyway other than curiosity.\" Mikhail nodded, some of the big brother instinct dying down as he sat up and decided to explain. \"Look, Sphinx. I'm cool that you two date or whatever. And trust me; I do NOT want to know anything other than you date. I just want to make sure she isn't going to get hurt. If she wants you to meet her dad then that's big . She's never wanted to introduce him to anyone . And whenever he'd ask, she'd always weasel out of it. My step father can be judgmental to say the least. And his new wife is a real bitch. Bigger than the one my Dad married.\" Sphinx looked at him, interest piqued. \"So?\" \"So just be careful. Ripley is a big girl but when she and Selene get near one another she just . . . Selene brings out the worst in her, you know? She thinks that she should come to London and live there. That she should do all of the society shit that our Mom fought to keep us out of and be thankful she's from a 'well off family' . Needless to say, Ripley hates her and her step sister. I honestly think she stayed in her old apartment because Selene hated it so damn much. But with you having to meet them . . . I'm just worried about the stress she'll be under. I'm pretty sure Selene expected Ripley to marry some freaking Lord or something.\" Sphinx nodded, looking down to Chaosia as she slept. He knew her father was some big to do across the pond but he never thought that she'd suffered because of it. Apparently, she had. Her almost vicious attitude towards people not changing anything and being themselves regardless started to make more sense. She wanted for other people what she expected for herself . . . and apparently hardly ever got. \"And now that she's with some boost there'll be hell to pay, right?\" Mikhail nodded. \"Pretty much. But don't worry, Ripley can put her in her place if need be. I just want to make sure you understand that that's not the way she feels. She can kind of forget that everyone else doesn't know she isn't some stuck up blue blood like her eldest half-brother.\" Sphinx nodded. Mikhail was actually trying to be decent as both a brother and a friend. So he could do something in return for him . . . \"Thanks,Boy-o. I'll talk to her about Monique if you want.\" Mikhail smirked, nodding. \"Yeah, I'd appreciate it. I really don't think she meant anything other than being an airhead. She's really book smart but not so much with other people, you know? Hell, at first I thought she was dumb as dirt and then she started spouting out about quantitative theories and artist motivation and how she used both in her actual artwork. I hope that if they spend time together they might be able to get along.\" Sphinx shrugged, knowing it would be a cold day in hell before Chaosia would willing agree to being near Monique for any reason. Mikhail seemed to share the opinion because he added, \"You know, when penguins inherit the seventh ring of hell.\" He quickly bid his goodnight and, after shaking Chaosia awake to say good bye, left. Sphinx picked Chaos up and carried her to her bedroom, letting her go and get undressed in peace as he went back to gather up their beer bottles. He was leaning against the kitchen counters when Chaos came in and leaned against his back. \"Hey handsome. Coming to bed?\" He turned back, smirking over his shoulder at her before nodding. To hell with her father and everything else. If they didn't want to be a part of her life with him in it then they'd deal with that later. But for now, he was going to enjoy having her. As Chaos laid her head on Sphinx's bare chest, she sighed. She'd heard most of his and Mikhail's conversation while she'd dozed and she would have to remember to cut her brother some slack where Monique was concerned. If she really meant something to him . . . he could and had done worse so she could be a little more tolerant. Plus, he'd taken care of explaining a good portion of the history between her and Selene so she was eternally grateful for that. She hated having to think about the woman, much less discuss her in detail. Sphinx shifted, running his fingers through her hair. She smiled lazily as she looked up at him, knowing he wanted to ask a million questions and wouldn't. He always played with her hair when he was in deep thought and she had a good idea what he was thinking about. \"My Dad isn't that bad, Sphinx. I mean, he can be but . . . when he's Stateside he relaxes so much it's almost like he's two different people. He lived here until after my Mom died. When he moved back to London for business and the whole family heritage crap, he started to change a little but he's usually still pretty cool with me. Selene is the one to watch out for.\" \"What's her deal then?\" Chaosia shrugged, kissing his chest before setting her chin against it and looking at him. \"No idea, really. I just know she's never liked me. Her daughter, Jacqueline is just as stuck up as she is and just as status hungry. What amazes me is that Mom and Dad both despised people like that when I was growing up . . . so I keep hoping that maybe there's something to them that I just don't see because I live across the freaking Atlantic.\" Sphinx shrugged, still petting her hair but she could feel some of the tension he'd come to bed with ebbing away. Finally, after a few minutes, he asked, \"How's your head then? Better?\" She nodded, snuggling closer to him as she answered. \"Yeah, a lot better. I took another shower after you left and laid back down . . .\" He looked down, wondering why she'd stopped. She looked at him, suddenly bashful. \"And?\" She blushed dark as she nudged him. \"Just accept that I figured out why my head hurt and move on.\" He looked at her, perplexed before she finally rolled her eyes and explained. \"It a girl thing, okay? Please tell me I don't have to explain that to you. I already feel bad enough as it is.\" He started to chuckle then gave up and laughed, long and hard. She blushed darker as she buried her face in his chest, hitting him hard as she ground out, \"It is NOT funny, Sphinx.\" He settled down, rubbing the spot she'd hit. She could pack a punch when she wanted to . . . \"So that means I can't pick a fight for how long?\" She glared. \"Four days asswipe. Now go to sleep.\" He chuckled, at least she would be back to normal before her father got to town. Thank God for small miracles there. Sorry, but a friend of mine threw down the gauntlet and i wasn't about to let her win. She does that enough as it is. Now, to the next chapter . . .[Chapter 14] Two Chapters in one day! There might even be three . . . but that's pushing it. Anyway onto the show! Had a Bad Day Chaosia groaned, rolling over and burying her face in the nearest pillow that smelled like her boyfriend. Her wonderful magnificent demented asshole of a boyfriend who thought it was so funny to pick on her while she was incapacitated. Hell, even Mikhail knew to leave her alone when she was hormonal but Sphinx seemed to think aggravating her, when she was already so emotional she could cry at the drop of a hat (there was no shame in admitting that to herself, just to other people), was damn right hilarious. So she'd banished him back to his man cave and told him she would see him in two days. Technically, she could see him tomorrow but she needed an extra day to just relax and to convince herself not to kill him. He had been so sweet the first night. He'd rubbed her back and shoulders and brought her a heating pad from his apartment (that was officially hers now regardless of what he wanted to say about. Besides he hardly ever spoke anyway so it's not like he'd actually protest anyway). The next day, it was like he'd switched his asshole switch to ON and that was that. He'd started poking her for no reason, smirking when she'd growl at him. He'd run out all of her hot water and conveniently forgotten to hang up his towel from said shower. He'd left a shoe out and about in her bedroom, causing her to trip . . . thus explaining the lovely new bruise blossoming on her cheek. She sighed. He'd freaked when he saw the bruise, practically try to freeze her to death with an ice pack before she banished him to his own home and refused to venture up the fire escape. And to add insult to injury, her damn cat had turned traitor and taken up with him! Bloody men! She huffed, knowing that Sphinx wasn't intentionally doing anything to annoy her (other than the poking thing) and that the majority of the issue was her and her hormonal mood swings . . . but she'd be damned if she'd let him know that! He was just going to suffer through his exile while she laid right in her bed and didn't do anything but go to school and eat a gallon of white chocolate ice cream when she got back. Two if her professor was still being a righteous dickweed. She pulled herself out of bed and to her bathroom, starting her shower. As she went back to lay out her clothes for today, she had to quell a huge rush of missing Sphinx. Usually when she was getting ready he was getting up and heading to his apartment or, when they were at his, getting up to walk her down before starting his own routine. Not seeing him taking up the majority of her bed was . . . oddly heart breaking. She shook her head, grabbing a loose pair of ripped up boyfriend cut jeans, a white tank top and a heather grey cardigan and throwing them on her bed. Her flip flops were already at the door so she could just slide into them before she left. She went back into the bathroom, stripping and submerging herself beneath the spray of hot water. She laid her head against the tile wall, thankful for hot water and good hot water heaters. Now she just had to find the energy to move get out of the shower . . . she'd make it eventually . . . Sphinx sat behind one of the desks at the morgue, bored to near tears. Chaosia was being a woman , in more ways than one this week and it left him with an amazing amount of spare time on his hands. What had he done before he got a girlfriend? He grimaced. He knew he'd gone about his day content and eager to torture any idiot to cross his path. Hell on slow days he had actually stalked the idiots to torture them . . . He smirked. It was almost time for him to leave, seeing as in he'd taken the night shift the past two days to occupy himself. And to be unavailable to help the idiots in their \"boosting school\". Memphis had talked to him, asking that he not teach Toby until Toby asked to be taught himself. He could still lay in wait for Richards and Newman though . . . Scare the pants off them before he went home to sleep. He shook his head. Better to go home, shower and collapse than stay and end up having to do double duty. Besides, Chaosia couldn't still be mad at him. Oh sure, she'd banished him from her apartment and sworn to remove very treasured portions of his anatomy if he didn't leave her alone until the day after next . . . but she was just being moody . He shrugged. It wasn't like he had to see her or anything. He just wanted to aggravate her. He'd never seen anyone turn that particular shade of red and growl when they were angry, so it had to be the fascination. Oh who was he trying to kid? He was beyond pissed that she could just banish him without so much as a thought and had still not called to apologize. She'd called almost immediately after their last fight and he was expecting the same thing this time. As he gathered his coat and keys, he had to admit that he knew he was being willfully obtuse when she kept asking him to stop but she was just so damned cute. And now her cat was at his apartment, refusing to leave longer than a few hours. Though it really didn't bother him. Hell, the black tomcat had stretched out on the couch beside him and purred, sleeping while Sphinx watched one of the movies Mikhail had brought him. He sighed, going to clock out. Hopefully after tomorrow everything would be fine . . . Chaos glared at her instructor as he graded her final project. The man was insane. He kept after her to expanded her horizons and push her limitations. She honestly thought he only told her that because he didn't have anything else to teach her. HE kept nodding and marking positive points here and there in her portfolio. He had commented on the photography twice already, evening going so far as to ask who the subjects in the pictures were. She sighed, explaining that the photographs were taken on an outing with some of her friends, some were of a garage she went to and the others were of her boyfriend, though he didn't know they were being taken. The man nodded, pushing his coke bottle glasses back up his nose as he handed her the final grade. She sighed, relieved as she saw it. A 92. She'd passed, though not as well as she'd expected but that didn't matter as much as passing. Passing meant that she didn't have to come back for the class later or the other workshops. All she had to do was refine it in the next class the following semester and that was that. \"Miss Guadimus?\" She looked up, amazed that she'd forgotten the man was still there. But then again, one could easily forget Mr. Byars. He had short dark hair and wore big think glasses. That coupled with the white button shirt, dark slacks and pocket protectors always made her think of him in the terms of a geek when she was especially aggravated with him. Which was most of the time due to his attitude and his weird habit of staring whenever she spoke or had to conference with him. She sighed. \"Yes sir?\" He pushed his falling glasses up again, clearing his throat. \"I just wanted to ask you a question of a personal nature, if you will allow it. Would you be adverse to engaging in a more personal and exploratory relationship than the one we currently share? \" She looked at his, honestly not understanding the question through the pretentious babble . She needed a geek translator . \"Excuse me?\" He leaned in, whispering. \"I've seen the photos of your boyfriend, Miss Guadimus. I never knew you were into older men. \" She blinked, stunned as what he was saying finally sank in. Then suddenly, she glared at him. \" Fuck off. I don't date my teachers.\" Her teacher scowled, clearly not liking being glared at or threatened. \"Honestly, Miss Guadimus. It's not like you aren't already seeing -\" She growled, shaking her head. \"Seeing who? My boyfriend? As in the only one I'm seeing or going to.\" He straightened, insulted at her rejection and attitude. \"I just wanted to test the waters, Chaosia. And see if we could come to an understanding of sorts. I didn't mean to imply-\" She snorted, scowl darkening. \"How else am I supposed to take that?\" Mr. Byars stopped then shrugged. \"Well, I just wanted to be sure. You're a strong willed woman, Miss Guadimus as well as very attractive. That alone makes up for the lack of intelligent conversation I'm sure accompanies your dalliances . I merely thought that we could become better acquainted seeing as in you are open to the experience. However, it seems that your tastes do not favor intellectuals. You'd rather consort with this sort of miscreant .\" She growled, still trying to contain herself. She would never have guessed that the man was so chauvinistic. She gathered her things, telling her teacher to fuck off again before going to her car. She almost walked right by the Aston, still not used to it. Of all the weeks to throw a rod in her Chevelle she had to do it this week. At least her Dad let her drive the thing instead of making her rent one. Not that she would have. Between Mikhail and Sphinx, she was pretty sure someone would have offered to share a vehicle if they'd had to but it was a sweet gesture on her Dad's behalf anyway. She cranked the car, enjoying the way it sounded before allowing herself to miss her SS. She loved the Aston but the SS held her heart like all great muscle cars. Besides, she felt too damn snooty driving this thing around Long Beach. Oh well, at least the diplomatic plate let her speed. Chaosia was livid as she slammed the door to her apartment. She didn't care if it sounded childish and immature but the second her father was Stateside she was going to ensure he tore the Governor's Auto Theft Division apart with his bare hands. She'd picked up Paul and the other two girls, Mia and Maetel, working on the huge music final with them, intent on going to lunch then heading back and working on the instrumental piece of their ten song CD project. And all had been fine until a now familiar Nova pulled up beside the Aston Martin One-77. It been embarrassing enough to explain that the two guys practically hanging out of the Nova beside them were friends and not escaped mental patients (though she was beginning to wonder) and that the boy in the backseat was by far the most levelheaded of the group if not a little shy. But as they'd pulled away, Tumbler had raced her to the next light. They had all laughed, Maetel even blowing kisses to poor Toby, who'd turned a marvelous shade of red. But when the boys ended up getting pulled by a very nasty cop in, of all things, a BMW SUV, it had been a damper on all of their fun. And just when she'd been so close to forgetting the idiot from earlier too. The man had been giving them the riot act until she went back (after a unanimous vote to do so) and explained that they had been joking around. The cop, a Detective Castlebeck, had given her a hard glare and warned her from associating with anyone who they hung around with. Chaosia had, with the line of decent behavior already blurred by hormones and the residual anger from the earlier jackass, proceeded to cuss him out and earn herself the nice four hundred dollar ticket in the glove compartment for verbally assault on an officer of the law. She snorted. An idiot with a power trip and a badge was more like it. She could admit that cussing at the cop was a mistake, no matter how big of an ass he was being. And though he seemed to want a reason to haul Kip away (for being related to Memphis or so he'd said later) he hadn't been what had finally sent over the edge of her temper and into the out-and-out freak out she'd had. It was his smug idiotic partner who'd saddled up to her car and checked the plates. Then he'd had the gall to ask her if it was her car. She'd stopped and glared at him before firing off, \"Why no Officer jerk off, I'm driving around in a stolen car with traceable diplomatic tags in the middle of down town at noon! Yes it my car. It's registered to my father. E. Prometheus Guadimus. Run the tags if you don't believe me.\" He'd looked at her and smirked. \"Give me your number and I won't call you on that bluff, sugar britches.\" She'd freaked, screaming at the now terrified man as he backed away. Paul had jumped out of the car and come to keep her from chasing him back into his car. Castlebeck had handed her the ticket and the stern warning before yelling at his partner to get in the damn car and left. Needless to say lunch was canceled; she was hungry and moody and just wanted to scream and then lay down and cry. Honestly, first she was an airhead art student and now she was a car thief. She pulled out her phone, calling Sphinx. When he answered, groggily, she asked, \"Can I come up? It's been a really bad day.\" He'd mumbled what sounded like a yes before hanging up. She tossed her phone, not caring to use it as she walked upstairs and in through his unlocked patio door. Sphinx was coming down the hallway, dressed in dark sleep pants and nothing else, his hair in disarray. He looked at her sleepily before yawning. Chaosia crossed the room, almost throwing herself into his chest talking a mile a minute. He looked down at her, shocked, before pulling her to him and rubbing her back. He led her down the hall, shaking his head at how worked up she was. Lord what had happened now? Sphinx led Chaosia to his bed, sitting her on it before stepping back and going to his now filled drawers. He came back, handing her a pair of sweatpants and his favorite Wales tee shirt and ushered her into the bathroom to change. When she came back, swallowed whole by his clothes she crawled into bed and laid her head on his chest, seeming so defeated he had to wonder what had happened. Where was the fighting hellcat from earlier this week? \"Okay, Love. From the beginning.\" As he listened to her tell him about her teacher and the grade and the remarks he'd made, he felt his blood boil. At least Chaosia would be out of his class in a little over two months. Besides, the teacher he could deal with but Castlebeck and his bloody partner were another thing entirely. He was glad Chaosia had stood up for herself and the lads against Castlebeck but the partner was going to be dealt with. Even if he had to do it himself . Chaosia finally quieted, sniffling as she looked up at him with watery eyes. \"And the worst part is that I can't do anything about it. If I go to the education and ethics board against Byars, it's my word against his . And the cops, oh those cops ! I swear my Dad will have their asses for this if I decide to still tell him about it. And that stupid ticket!\" Sphinx sighed, rubbing her back. \"It'll be fine, Love. Hell, I'll pay it if I have to. After I deal with Castlebeck and that idiot Drycoff. Look, just go to sleep, Love. Everything'll be fine in the morning, okay?\" She nodded. \"Do you work tomorrow?\" He shook his head. \"No, Love. I'm off the next three days. We'll go do something, alright? Just breathe and relax. Everything else'll be dealt with. Promise.\" She sighed, snuggling into him. \"Thanks, Sphinx. I don't know what I'd do without you.\" He chuckled, shaking his head. \"Kill cops probably.\" She smirked, settling into a light dose. He was almost asleep himself when he heard her murmur, \"Goodnight, Sphinx. Love you.\" He jolted awake, careful not to wake her as he looked down at her. He knew they'd know each other over a month now and been dating most of it, but to hear her say (or mumble as was the case) those three words made his heart twist in two different directions. He wanted to say it back and wanted to run for the hills at the same time. Love meant something completely different than like or lust. And though he knew what he had for Chaos went well beyond either of those things, he didn't know if it was love. Not yet anyway. Hell, it'd been so long since he was in love that he almost didn't remember what it felt like anymore. But as he watched her sleep, completely at ease with the facts of who and what he was and still content to be here, he knew it could easily turn into more. The question was, did he want it to? Chaos was young, younger than him by over ten years. And while it didn't bother him (hell it was kind of nice having a younger girl friend most days) he could see her wanting all of the things he'd sworn he'd never touch or mess with when he was younger. She would definitely want kids and houses and white picket fences one day. And he wasn't so sure he'd ever want them period. He needed to think about this. She stirred, grumbling at him half asleep. \"Quit thinking so hard and loud. Every time you do, your muscles bunch and go all hard.\" He chuckled. \"Sorry to make you lose your comfy pillow then.\" He sighed. Might as well ask now. \"Did you mean it?\" She looked up at him, bleary eyed. \"Mean what?\" Then it clicked and she blushed before shrugging and nodding. \"Yeah, I meant it when I said I love you.\" She sat up, propping herself on and elbow to look at him. \"That what the deep thought's over?\" He nodded once, watching her as she smiled and shook her head before leaning down and kissing him. \"I love you means just that, Sphinx. I love you. Not 'Hey lets run away and get married or buy a house and pop out kids'. I don't even want kids. Not right now anyway. Hell, my niece and nephew have been enough to make me seriously rethink ever having them period if all kids are like that. I mean, I know they say when they're yours its different but I seriously doubt most people contemplate putting the three year old in the washing machine when he doesn't want to take a bath. Even if it is only a passing thought.\" He raised a brow, \"What now?\" She shrugged. \"I was babysitting Fox's brats and the next thing I knew my nephew was covered in chocolate and dirt. He had to have bath and nearly beat me to death in the process. I swear I almost put him in the spin cycle just to give him a reason to scream. That was when I was sixteen and I have never seriously thought about kids since. I mean, if it happens it happens but I'm not planning on them, you know?\" He looked at her. \"Are you sure you're a woman? I mean, don't all women want babies and houses and husbands?\" She laughed, shaking her head. \"Nope. My mom was almost thirty when she had my sister and brother. She was closer to forty when she had me. . . And my oldest sister, Fox was a surprise so . . .\" She shrugged again, smiling at him. \"Don't fret about it okay? If it bothers you so much I won't say it.\" He shook his head, answering before he realized he was talking. \"Nah, Love. Say whatever you want.\" She shook her head, settling back into his chest after kissing him and saying, \"Well, Goodnight Sphinx. I love you.\" What seemed like an eternity later, he was still running his fingers through her hair and thinking about the revelations she'd set before him. She cared about him, wanted his opinion and his attention but was okay with what she got from him. She came to him with a problem, but as a confidante and lover not an ass saver. She tolerated his ways (mostly) and let him be himself even when he could tell she didn't understand it. And despite their differences, she wanted him. She honestly did love him. And he wanted her. He wanted to wake up with her and to see her throughout the day. To hear her laugh or joke or showcase that mean spirited sense of humor she saved just for him. He valued her opinion. And he wanted to keep her safe and happy. And despite their differences, he wasn't bored or bothered and about to kill her. He stopped, amazed at the conclusion he'd come to. He loved her. He loved her . Christ what was he going to do now? He'd seen what love did to people, men especially. Hell, he'd been there before himself and had barely gotten out alive. She sighed and he looked down, not caring that he knew he was wearing some silly soft face as he watched her sleep. She shifted, kissing his chest before settling back into a deeper sleep. To hell with it . . . So he was in love . . . with a fellow crew member's baby sister . . . that was twelve years his junior . . . with a British high-to-do for a father . . . He looked down at her, scowling at the top of her curls. Damnation, girlie. You'll be the death o' me yet. You'd better be glad I love you too. Okay, There. The L word is out and will be seen some. Not a lot but some. Thanks for the reviews and everything guys and gals. Later[Chapter 15] Okay, I lied. Three chapters in one day! Yeah! Of Fathers and Men Sphinx kept glaring at his reflection. His tie wouldn't sit right no matter how many times he retied the damn thing. He was five seconds away from going without. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye, watching Chaosia's fat cat hop on his dresser and meow. He glared at the cat. He didn't know why the damn thing wouldn't just go home and be fed. Chaos had giggled when she'd found out he'd been staying up here, eating table scraps and bacon. Apparently, he now had a devoted minion. Too bad all he did was whine and purr. He tossed the tie, finally having enough and went to procure another from the depths of his closet. Chaosia was already dressed and waiting downstairs, with her father and stepmother. And all he had left to do was tie the damn tie. The white silk tie cooperated better than its striped pale blue brethren had and he grabbed his coat from the bed, hurrying to go downstairs. He checked his pockets. He had his wallet and keys in one, the cell phone in the other. Atley was already on alert that, should the evening start to sour, he would be getting a text message to send a fake emergency call to rescue both Sphinx and Chaosia. Chaosia had been a little too eager to agree after returning from her father's home and Sphinx knew an omen when he saw one. He sighed, locking his door and heading to the elevator. He checked himself in the mirrored doors. The navy suit, tailored to fit, was immaculate as well as the matching navy blue dress shirt. His cufflinks were in order as were his tie (which looked better than the striped one anyway in his opinion) and his shoes. He sighed, readying himself for whatever lay in wait behind the bright coral door of Chaosia's apartment. At least they were leaving after dinner and Chaos wouldn't have to deal with them again until the weekend. Now if they could only survive tonight. He crossed the hallway, knocking on the door out of formality rather than necessity. He doubted her father would appreciate some bloke just sauntering into his daughter's apartment like he owned the place. Chaosia opened the door and Sphinx had to remember to breathe. Her hair was down, save the small hump where her bangs were pinned up, and styled in soft waves around her face, showing off the natural beauty and the make-up Paul had done earlier. She was wearing a navy blue (taffeta) dress with a sweetheart neckline and a fold over bust. The mid-thigh skirt had three pleats and diagonal pockets which are adorned with crystal beading that matched her tear drop diamond earrings and the huge diamond cluster cocktail ring on her right hand. He smirked, seeing the matching navy clutch purse and the white cardigan she already had in her hands. Sphinx watched her walk back into her apartment, noting the white satin stilettos. Lord, she was killing him. She turned smiling as he came to stand beside her. He noticed the other woman in the room and had to keep from rolling his eyes at her shocked expression. Her hair was a deep black, swept back from her face and up into an elaborate hairstyle with lots of curls. Her black dress was well fitting with a halter top and a deep V that showed off ample cleavage and the overly large diamond necklace. Her shoes added at least three inches to her height, bringing her to Sphinx's chin. She would have been gorgeous if not for the cold glint to her icy blue eyes. She smiled, dipping her head to Sphinx as he nodded in her direction. He did not care for the way she was looking him over, or the way she kept glancing at Chaosia. Chaosia looked about ready to snap, her arm looped through Sphinx's when a warm, deep voice caused all three to turn to the patio. \"So the mystery beau is here.\" There was no mistaking this man was Chaosia's father. They had identical coloring and the same light blue-green eyes, and he was wearing a simple black suit with a white shirt and black tie. But he was tall, standing almost a full inch taller than Sphinx himself. As he crossed the kitchen to the living room, Sphinx could feel himself starting to tense under the man's deep gaze. The man's dark hair was salt-and-peppered upon closer inspection and he had laugh lines that gave a hint to his true age. He held out his hand to Sphinx, who took it and shook it firmly. They sized each other up momentarily before Chaosia rolled her eyes and swatted her father. \" Daddy ! You promised to behave. No macho crap. Remember?\" The man laughed, releasing Sphinx's hand and turning to his daughter. Chaosia was glaring up at her father while he smirked down at her. Sphinx mentally huffed. No wonder she and Mikhail weren't fazed. They dealt with this man every day for years. Her father turned away first, smirking at Sphinx. \"Where are my manners ? I am Edward Prometheus Guadimus. And you must be the Mister Sphinx I keep hearing about.\" Sphinx nodded, rubbing Chaosia's arm under her cardigan to get her to calm down. \"Yes sir. Pleased to make you acquaintance. Chaosia's spoken of you and your wife often.\" Guadimus looked shocked at the British accent while Selene sauntered forward and draped herself over her husband's side, smirking. \"Oh, well, I promise that only the good things are true.\" Chaosia glared, opening her mouth to speak as Sphinx cut her off, smiling at her father and ignoring her stepmother completely. \"She's only had good things to say, ma'am. So, how long are you stateside?\" Guadimus looked at him, a new glint to his eye that had Chaosia fidgeting. \"Well, it was only supposed to be for the weekend but I'm thinking of staying for a week, maybe two. I rarely get to see my daughter and I would like to see my wayward stepson sometime as well . . . If Chaosia hasn't killed him yet.\" Sphinx chuckled, nodding as he groaned internally. This was some fresh new hell if he'd ever seen it. No wonder Chaos had been on pins and needles about it. \"He was fine last I saw him. Chaos and I ate with him and his girlfriend a few days ago.\" The older man looked at Chaosia, intrigued as Selene put in her opinion. \"Mikhail is dating and you're not foaming at the mouth? Did you set them up?\" Chaosia rolled her eyes, looking to her dad. \"She's actually a photographer and an artist. She's not half bad, either. A little eccentric but nowhere near as bad as it could be.\" Her father nodded shuddering before clapping his hands together. \"So, on to the food then?\" As they sat at the restaurant, Chaosia held Sphinx's hand in a death grip. She knew he had to be uncomfortable but she had to have a lifeline to keep up from strangling Selene. The woman had already insulted Long Beach and her home five times before Sphinx had even made it down after changing from work . . . and she'd been about to eat hardwood floor when Sphinx had swooped in. She turned, smiling at him as he rubbed the top of her hand with his thumb under the table. At least they'd come on the weekend rather than earlier this week or she really would have killed Selene. Sphinx could even dispose of the body for her via the morgue . . . Oh the possibilities. She turned back to her father and stepmother, inwardly groaning at the look her father was giving Sphinx. At least he liked him well enough. Hell he hadn't threatened to have him bagged and tagged if he ever set foot in London so that in itself was a huge plus. But Selene needed to push her damn eyes right back into her head. She knew her boyfriend was attractive (hell he was one of the most attractive men she'd ever met in her opinion) in an unconventional way. And dressed up and acting civil . . . well, civil-er was a true treat. But if Selene raked her gold digging eyes over his chest one more time she was going to beat the woman to death with the bread. Sphinx squeezed her hand, still listening to her Dad drone on and on about some social reform or another. Sphinx at least knew what he was talking about and could engage in the conversation . . . though she doubted her father would appreciate a true political debate with the stoic boost. Sphinx excused himself to go to the rest room, leaving Chaos wondering if she could go and they could bail. Her father was being human but she knew that could change in a heart beat . . . and Selene . . . Her father turned to her after Sphinx was out of earshot, stating, \"Well, Chaosia. I admit I'm highly surprised and impressed. That man is not what I was expecting to find when I set out today. I must say I approve.\" Chaosia looked at her father stunned as Selene glared at him. \"Well, he seems nice enough but he's not much for conversation is he? You've had to practically pry the whole ten words he's said out of him.\" Chaosia glared at Selene, ready to defend Sphinx and her choices when her father laughed, patting Selene's hand. \"And that I find refreshing . He doesn't see the need to babble on and on about inanities and trivialities. He's sure of what he believes and acts thusly.\" He turned to Chaosia, a dark gin in place as he continued, \"Besides, I'm sure my little girl talks enough for both of them. It's good to see you with someone calm and level headed.\" She looked at her father. Lord he actually liked him. Now what? Sphinx returned a few seconds later, dipping down to kiss the crown of Chaosia's head before retaking his seat. Chaosia smiled at him, quickly retaking his hand and holding it on her thigh. He sighed. Her father was actually okay. A little pushy and long winded but nothing that he hadn't encountered before and couldn't deal with. The stepmother was making even his skin crawl, and he could easily see most of Chaosia's aversions to the woman were justified. It had actually been her that had caused him to leave to gather his wits before. She kept looking him over and turning to Chaos smirking. She knew what she was doing to her stepdaughter and thought it was funny. So he had to get out for a moment before he adjusted a lifelong standard: Never hit a woman. Guadimus turned and looked at him, pulling a clove cigarette package from his inner pocket. He held out the pack in offer but Sphinx shook his head then watched amazed as Chaosia actually snagged one and Selene groaned rolling her eyes. \"Lord help us, they can't eat together without smoking those vile things.\" Guadimus took it in stride, patting Selene's hand again after lighting his cigarette and tossing Chaosia the lighter. \"It's a tradition we've had since she was eighteen my Darling. She's the only one who ever smokes or drinks with her poor old father.\" Chaosia rolled her eyes, holding the black cigarette between her lips as she lit it. Sphinx watched her, unable to actually process a full thought as she drew on the cig just enough to light it before flicking the lighter closed and tossing it to her father (who caught it effortlessly) without ever looking in his direction. She turned, looking at him and then blushed. \" What ? I only smoke these when I'm around him .\" Guadimus chuckled, nodding as he ashed in the tray the waiter had brought, ignoring the glare of his wife as he added his input. \"It's true. Chaosia and I started this tradition years ago. The first night in we eat where ever she wants, drink plenty of Scotch and smoke a cigarette. It used to be cigars but . . .\" Selene glared between the two. \"They stink up my house and I banned them. Because they're houses not pubs .\" Sphinx chuckled, shaking his head as Chaosia blew smoke rings, making Selene growl and her father laugh. He could easily see where her attitude came from as he watched them both harass Selene, who for all of her bitching watched her husband with fond eyes. Sphinx suddenly had a suspicion as to why Chaosia hadn't plotted the coup yet. And it was only being furthered by their bantering. He still didn't like the woman much though. When the food had come and gone, Chaosia and her father had a bottle of fifty five year old Macallan in LALIQUE scotch between them, although it was now about half empty. The two of them had effectively gone through half of the most expensive bottle of alcohol Sphinx had ever seen in a manner of minutes. And neither seemed fazed. Selene, seeing the look of pure astonishment on his face leaned over and informed him, \"This is nothing . His liquor cabinets at home are stocked with one hundred year old and up and they can clear it like there's no tomorrow. They drink like fish when they're together. So be warned that what we have to look forward to for a week.\" Sphinx nodded, watching Chaosia swirl the dark rose wood colored liquid in her glass, laughing at some story her father was telling. She turned and smiled at him, her cheeks flushed as she held out her glass to him. \"Don't you want to try it? I swear it's good.\" Guadimus laughed, long and deep as Sphinx rolled his eyes and took the glass to appease Chaosia. He smelled the scotch, surprised that it actually smelled decent. He usually stayed away from anything over twelve years old as a rule of thumb, since the older the stronger and the sneakier it was on getting you shitfaced . . . but what the hell. It smelled spicy, with hints of raisins and orange zest. He took a small drink and had to nod after he could breathe. While the drink itself was actually soft, smooth and spicy, with lingering touches of citrus and peat-smoke, the actual alcohol burned like the Dickens and he was beginning to wonder if the reason the two idiots in front of him were consuming so heavily was because they'd burned away their throats and taste buds. Regardless he shrugged and commandeered Chaosia's glass as his own while she pouted and had to get another. He drank watching as Chaosia and her father continued to smoke and drink, laughing at whatever they were talking about, and he came to a conclusion. His life was never boring before she'd entered it but it had become so much more interesting since she'd doused him with coffee nearly a month ago. She'd brought laughter and mischief into both his home and his crew. And he could easily admit, watching her with flushed cheeks and dancing eyes as she ribbed her father for going grey, that he loved her. She turned and smiled at him, winking before stealing the bottle from her father. \"No, Da'. You've had enough. Is Selene driving back?\" He shrugged then stopped to actually think about it. \"Well, I guess she'd have to, wouldn't she? Since your old man took his sot for a walk.\" They both laughed as she took his keys and handed them to Selene who was already gathering coats. When he looked up at her and smiled, Selene just brushed his bangs back and looked skyward. \"Lord help me get him to the car and I'll never let him drink again.\" He chuckled, winking at his daughter. \"Now that is a promise you can't keep, Love.\" Sphinx watched, marveled as he stood up and adjusted his suit like he hadn't consumed enough alcohol to kill someone, then turned and hugged the now standing and equally unfazed Chaosia. Sphinx rose and shook his hand. The man never swayed on his feet as he turned and walked towards the exit waving over his shoulder. \"See you bright and early Saturday, Chaosia. Bring your boy if he wants to come.\" Sphinx looked down, brow raised as the waiter handed Chaosia the bottle of Scotch in a wine bag to go. \"Come where?\" She shrugged, scowling as she told him. \"Dad is insisting on buying me a new car. He said that the Chevelle was probably going to continue to give me trouble and he wanted me to have a decent back up car until we could work out the kinks with the SS.\" Sphinx nodded. It was sound and if the man was going to purchase it for her all the better he supposed . . . \"Why are you not happy then? I don't know anybody who'd turn down a free car.\" She looked at him as he held the door to the restaurant for her to leave. \"Its supposed to be a graduation present. I already have one degree and he feels bad that I wouldn't let him get me anything then. So he's going to go ahead and double whammy me on this one I just know it.\" Sphinx chuckled, opening the car door when the thought occurred. \"Where are you going?\" She blushed, looking out the window muttering so he couldn't hear her. \"Come again, Love?\" She sighed. \"The Aston Dealership.\" He looked at her before smiling rakishly and patting the dashboard. \"Get her sister then.\" Chaos growled and smacked him before shaking her head. \"What color? Black?\" He shook his head, cranking the car. \"Nah, Love. I think she'd look smashing in red .\" She rolled her eyes, kissing his cheek. \"You would .\" Next time on It All Started with a Cup of Coffee- Car shopping the legal way! Later.[Chapter 16] Okay, this is sort of a double whammy. It's an author's note and an update all in one. I'm probably going to be absent for a few days seeing as in the area I live and work in was hit by a rather nasty tornado earlier today. I was actually at work (though I was just helping out and not on the clock but still) when it came through and demolished our parking lot and tore half of the front of the building off and practically spun away with the surrounding buildings. On that note, I am officially going to take a day or two to try and recuperate and not freak whenever I see lightening or hear those damn sirens. Its times like this I hate being in the South and having to deal with our weird weather. But, I promise I'll have another chapter for you guys soon. And as a good will gesture, here's a small chapter update. Thanks for the reviews and the support. It really means a lot. I'm going to ignore the horrible storms in my area right now. Later. An Interlude and Boosting Lesson Toby watched Sphinx intensely as he carefully tripped the lock on the Aston he'd driven to Otto's, slowly opening the door then quickly setting to work disabling the alarm and cranking the engine. Toby looked at his watch amazed. The car went from parked and dead to alive and ready to jet in under fifty seconds . . . forty one to be precise. He sighed. He would never be that quick at boosting. Sphinx killed the engine and, after making sure the OnStar was disengaged with the password Chaosia had given him, turned to Toby and handed him the tools. He nodded his head towards the car once before hitting the alarm button to reset it. Toby gulped, looking from him to the car like he was crazy. \"You want me to do that? Seriously?\" Sphinx nodded, stepping away from the car to give him room. The boy had called and asked to learn and this was the best way for him to do so . . . without the threat of jail time that is. Toby, to his credit, gulped and started to work on the lock. As he slid the slim jimmie in-between the glass and the seal he moved wrong, tripping the alarm. Sphinx sighed, stopped and reset the alarm before nodding to him to try again. Toby nodded, jaw set in determination as he quickly slipped the jimmie into the door pane again and popped the lock. Sphinx looked at his watch. It'd only taken him five seconds the next attempt. Not bad . . . Toby quickly disengaged the alarm and cranked the car, looking back to Sphinx who nodded, showing him his time. Sixty three seconds. Not bad at all for someone who'd never boosted a European before. Chaosia came out of Otto's office, shaking her head as she saw Toby smiling widely and practically jumping for joy. She smirked, calling out to him. \"What's the verdict, Toby? To boost or not to boost?\" Toby smiled, rushing up and hugging her before turning back to Sphinx grinning like an idiot. \"To boost . It's actually pretty cool when someone shows you how to do this stuff without all the showboating Kip and Tumbler do.\" Sphinx nodded as Chaosia shook her head again, coming to stand beside her boyfriend. He looped his arm over her shoulder and pulled her into his side, kissing the top of her hair before he realized that they had an audience. Sure it was just Toby but still, he did have a reputation to uphold. Chaos just smiled and looked up at him, arms around his waist. She was wearing flip flops today so she was only at his chest, not that he minded. The shorts she was wearing were the worst though. The mid-thigh plaid boating shorts that showed off way more skin than he wanted them to, coupled the white tank top and navy blue zip up hoodie made her look like she was heading for a day on a yacht. Oh wait, she was . \"Penny for your thoughts, Big Boy.\" He looked down at her, shrugging his eyebrows as he said, \"Just curious how you'll do on a boat is all.\" She smacked him, turning to Toby who asked, \"Boat? You're going on a boat?\" She nodded. \"Yeah, Mikhail and I are going to spend the morning sailing with Dad and then we're going to go look at cars.\" Toby nodded, looking at Sphinx. \"So are you going too?\" Chaosia answered, elbowing him in the ribs to make him quit glaring at Tumbler and Kip, who had just walked in with Memphis and Mirror in tow. Tumbler had a death wish that could easily be granted if he cat called at Chaos one more time. \"Nope. I'm not throwing him on a boat until I'm positive he won't use it to dispose of bodies. The last thing I'm going to teach Sphinx is how to sail, especially with how keen he was on the whole Dexter scenario. I am going to teach Mikhail how to not get sea sick. He is going car shopping with me later, though\" Sphinx grumbled, nodding to Memphis who was taking in his current attire with way too much mirth in his eyes. Chaosia had best wait on him hand and foot for a week with the hell he'd put up with for the damn khakis she'd practically forced him into. And why did they have to be so light? \"So, uh, Sphinx? Did you let Chaos dress you today or did you decide it was okay to wear something other than black?\" Sphinx ground his teeth as Chaos smirked. She knew what this was going to do and she thought it was hilarious. Oh, it wasn't going to be funny later. Chaosia answered, giving Memphis a dark look. \"Oh, he just didn't want to get carted away from a car dealership in handcuffs like his fearless leader did a few weeks ago.\" Memphis sputtered, looking to Chaos then turning to glare at the now rolling Tumbler and Kip. \"You told her about that ? Why in God's name?\" Kip shrugged, wiping a tear from his eye as he explained about the Castlebeck episode and how he felt it would be nice to tell her since she'd gotten such a nice sized ticket for it. He turned to Chaos, asking, \"So what are you going to do about that? I mean I know your Dad's well-off but I don't think anyone really had and extra four hundred dollars lying around.\" Chaos smirked, winking at him as she walked away and towards her car, intending to liberate it from boosting practice before they killed it (though she doubted Sphinx would let them, she still didn't trust the younger ones too much). \"Oh don't worry. My Dad will take care of it. See he was pretty upset that they accused me of stealing what's practically my car while you guys fix my baby so . . . I doubt he'll give any of you any trouble for a while.\" Kip and Tumbler laughed high-fiving as Sphinx and Memphis shared a look. Lord maybe those two with Chaos around wasn't going to be a good thing. Mikhail acted more like a member of the Old School (most days) therefore he easily floated between the two crews. Chaos however seemed to share some of the mischief the others clung to. And she apparently loved having someone to get in trouble with other than Paul and Sway (who were still here favorite partners in crime). She got in her car, Sphinx walking over and leaning in to the window as she rolled it down. She smiled, leaning up to kiss his cheek as she revved the engine. \"I'll see you later, Sphinx. Just remember to meet me there, okay? And please don't bring Memphis. My step-mother couldn't handle watching one of Mikhail's friends get arrested. Especially with me and Dad already driving her mad.\" He smirked, nodding as he kissed her quickly. \"Right-o Love.\" She beamed up at him. \"Good. Love you. See you later.\" And with that, she pulled (slowly for once) out of the garage and waited until she was out onto the service road before beginning to drive like a mad woman. Sphinx shook his head as Memphis drooled after the car before asking him, \"So, what's she going to get to park at your place?\" Sphinx shrugged, turning to watch the dirt cloud Chaos had kicked up dissipate. He knew whatever Chaos got; he would probably drive just as much as she would, more if Memphis had anything to do with it. As he went back in, he caught himself wishing he'd told her he loved her too . . . But quickly dismissed it. She knew she meant something to him. Besides, they had all of the time in the world to be all mushy and lovey-dovey when they got home. He refused to make an ass of himself, especially in front of Memphis. Hell the man would never let him live it down. He looked up just in time to duck a rather oily rag and glare at Kip and Tumbler for tossing them. Bloody hell, he had to keep the damn navy shirt and khaki pants clean for another four hours around these morons? Chaos was definitely going to be waiting on him hand and foot. Hell, she might have to clean his entire apartment and cook dinner for this shit storm she'd landed him in. He sighed, shaking his head as he crossed to go into Otto's office to sit and watch the game with Memphis and Atley. Lord at least he would be safe there. Time passed quickly as he watched the two argue and toss chips at one another, Otto having come in and taken the seat beside him, a permanent smirk on his face. He apparently detested American Football as much as Sphinx did, but was watching for an excuse to escape whatever chore Junie had planned. And to watch Memphis and Atley make idiots out of themselves, of course. When he saw it was time to leave, he nodded his good byes to the others, ducking out of the office and towards Eleanor. Memphis was letting him 'borrow' the bloody thing so Mikhail would have something to drive back. Because there was no way in hell he was letting the boy drive his Malibu. He got in the Shelby, enjoying the sound of the engine as he brought it roaring to life. He smirked. At least he wasn't going to be stuck with her bleeding step-mother for hours again. Or her father would be minus a wife .[Chapter 17] Welcome to the Family As Sphinx pulled Eleanor into the Aston Martin Dealership, he had to wonder why Chaosia had ever switched to driving a classic (hence money eating) car instead of any of the others she could obviously have. Her father certainly hadn't shown any qualms about financing whatever his daughter desired . . . and yet Chaosia had steadfastly refused to let the man do practically anything but take care of the dinner bill and use some of influence to get Castlebeck of her ( and by extension the crew's) ass for a while. He killed the engine and waited, double checking that he had the bloody keys to the damned Mustang before getting out and leaning against the hood. It certainly wouldn't do for him to start caving to Chaosia's more forgetful tendencies with her and the family en route. He glanced at his watch, ever mindful of the now hovering salesman. Thank God Chaos hadn't put him in all light colors or he would practically be swamped. Dark colors kept people at arm's length . . . especially when they were on someone of his size and sunny disposition. He snorted to himself, eyeing the gunmetal grey V12 Vantage that pulled into the lot next to him. Guadimus was behind the wheel and Selene was practically laying down in the passenger seat, arm tossed over her eyes dramatically as her husband laughed and smoked one of the ever present cloves. Chaos and Mikhail pulled in next and slid in on the other side of Eleanor, barely leaving any space to open the doors. Sphinx shook his head, more than slightly shocked when Mikhail spilled out of the driver's seat, cackling like a hyena as Chaos got out grinning. Selene was glaring at them as she left the comfort of her car, telling her husband, \"I would say he's a bad influence on her but I know it's the other way around. Seriously, Prometheus when are you going to get her under hand? I'm amazed she hasn't killed anyone with her antics . . . or totaled another car.\" Guadimus, however, just shook his head. He was apparently far to used to this argument for it to upset him like it was Mikhail and Sphinx. He looked to Chaos, winking. \"She gets good grades, she stays out of jail, and she pays her own way. Hell, Selene I spend more on one of your and Jacqueline's little excursions to Paris than I do on Chaosia in two years . Besides, our deal is that she behaves when she's in London and she can do whatever wherever else.\" Selene huffed, flipping her dark hair over a now tanned shoulder as she looked towards the silently fuming siblings. \"She still needs to act like a Lady , Prometheus. She represents our family and I will not have that reputation tarnished in any way.\" Mikhail was pissed and clenching his fists, but keeping his notorious temper under control for the most part. And while Sphinx could honestly say he was impressed by monumental display of restraint, he was personally about to remove the woman's head from her shoulders. He could even gift wrap it for Chaosia for Christmas. Prometheus gave his wife a deadpan look before dryly commenting, \"Oh yes dear . Because Jacqueline's notoriety for whoring around within the 'proper' social circles and Shinobi's gambling and drug issues are nothing compared to my brash and barbaric daughter's refusal to bow down to anyone with a title before their name is certainly going to ruin us. How I have raised my children is no one's concern, Selene. Nor is whatever short comings they might possess . . . especially when held against the actions of my other step children. You would do well to remember that while I do not always voice it, I am always aware of what transpires around me.\" Selene glared as Sphinx mentally tucked away the hidden threat. The man was always aware of what was going on around him, even if he seemed oblivious. That information, and how he had practically transformed from carefree to lethal-but-friendly within two seconds showed Sphinx more than the entire dinner had. This was a man to watch . . . because he was dangerous . Perhaps not in the same was he was but Prometheus Guadimus had displayed he was deadly in his own right. Chaosia, sensing the war brewing, came around and grabbed her father's hand. \"Come on Daddy. If you're going to make me get a damn car you'd better make me do it right. I need constant supervision you know.\" He laughed, looping an arm over her shoulder and ruffling her hair after tossing his half-finished clove. \"Ah yes, well. It's because you take after me , my darling. You're the only of my children that does . . . Sadly, I have no idea who Bastian takes after.\" She giggled, looking back over her shoulder and winking at Sphinx and her brother, who were calming as her step mother glared and came to follow behind them. \"I think he takes after your first wife. You know, the royal bitch.\" He laughed, nodding. \"Ah . . . well . . . arranged marriages are hardly ever convenient for the two directly involved. I should be glad he speaks to me period if that's who he takes after. Lord knows he got her glare.\" He shuddered as both Chaos and Mikhail laughed. Mikhail, seeing Sphinx was lost, allowed the other three to go ahead so they could talk. Well, he could talk and Sphinx could listen at any rate. \"Bastian is her oldest half-brother from her father's first marriage. He's worse about all of the society bullshit than Selene is . . . and he's always trying to get Chaosia to move to London and be more active in society and in 'her birthright' and all of that happy horse shit. They get along but just barely.\" Sphinx looked at Mikhail, brow raised. He knew she had another brother. She had mentioned him in passing . . . but he was like Selene and he was still breathing ? Mikhail noticed the look and nodded. \"I know. He's living on borrowed time. I know it, you know it and Pops knows it . . . but Bastian refuses to acknowledge the fact.\" He sighed, looking up to watch his sister groan as her father started pulling her towards the Rapides and Vantages. He shook his head as he and Sphinx heard Guadimus try to coax Chaos into at least looking the other cars without him having to pick it for her. \"You know if I pick this car, Chaosia Ripley, than it's going to be as expensive and weighed down with useless techno gadgets and features as possible just to spite you. Now look at the damn cars . They won't kill you.\" She glared before hanging her head and trudging behind him to look at cars like she was going to the gallows. Her father was unaffected by her sudden taste in theatrics. \"Oh suck it up, Duckie. You'll live. You're old man is just forcing you to get a free European luxury car for no other reason than he loves you.\" She glared at him from the corner of her eye, not buying his too innocent act for a second. \" Oh please . Love as nothing to do with this. This is retribution and torture , father. Pure and simple.\" Sphinx and Mikhail shared a look before they went to rescue her as her father cackled like a mad man, a wicked gleam in his eye as he shrugged. \"Well maybe a little. But I want you to have a car that runs.\" She huffed, leaning into Sphinx as he walked up. \" My Chevelle runs, Daddy. It's not her fault that she threw a rod. Besides, Otto will have it fixed within another week.\" He father rolled his eyes, nonplussed as he inspected the silver DBS Coupe parked before them with a critical hungry eye. \"Yes dear, it will for now . But when something else breaks, and on older cars it's only a matter of time, you'll have a backup. Besides, I'm sure Sphinx here isn't going to let you near his car after he sees you in action.\" Mikhail grinned, nodding his head at Sphinx while Chaos blushed. It was obvious she came by more than a few of her odder quirks and habits honestly while her brother had clearly adopted them from his stepfather. \"Oh, sorry to burst your bubble Pops, but Sphinx here has seen how Chaos drives and still let her behind the wheel of his car. Actually, I think other than Atley she's the only person who's ever touched the Malibu more than once and lived to tell the tale.\" Prometheus smirked, the wicked gleam ever present as he chuckled. \"Well, I guess you like to live dangerously my boy. Sounds like you've met your match, Duckie.\" Sphinx watched as Chaosia's blush spread as he nodded, enjoying the way she seemed to fidget under all three stares. That would teach her to dress him like a bloody sissy then leave him to the mercy of Memphis and Atley. She cleared her throat, elbowing Sphinx in the stomach before stepping away and towards the larger show room. \"Fine go ahead, the lot of you laugh at my expense. See if I speak to any of you after this.\" Mikhail and her father looked to one another, strangely silent for a few moments before erupting into peals of laughter. They were literally clutching each other to stay standing as they laughed, drawing more than a few astonished and aggravated stares from other customers and sales staff alike. Mikhail called after her, trying to get in the last word as she walked away. \"Oh, that's a great loss! Hell, Sphinx here will probably dance at my wedding for getting you to be quiet for more than a few minutes!\" Her father nodded, agreeing. \"Aye, if she's anything like her mother then he hasn't had a moment's peace since she tore his world apart around him.\" He clapped his hand on Sphinx's shoulder, still laughing as his daughter fumed, increasing her pace as she walked away. Lord she was pissed . \"You're on that shit list too, my boy. Welcome to the family.\" She glared over her shoulder before spotting a sales clerk and smiling. Sphinx was suddenly very worried for her father . . . and his checkbook. Chaosia was sure that the sales clerk was going to go into shock at any second. She was sure that the gangly man had never seen one of the One-77s up close before she had demanded to see every one they had in stock. Which is why she'd chosen him to specifically to wait on her . . . well, that and because he reminded her of Toby and hadn't been following her preening stepmother around like a lost puppy. He walked with her around the showroom, telling her every detail of the model while giving her a wide berth should she decide to get closer to the car, and answering all of her questions. She was looking at the next to the last car on the floor when she heard a round of loud laughter and her brother squeak from the other showroom. She looked at the sales clerk, shaking her head as she said, \"I apologize for them. I can't take them anywhere these days.\" He smiled, waving away her apology as he chuckled. \"Its cool. Actually, they've provided the most entertainment I've seen around here yet. I actually just transferred from the sister dealership next door. And this place can get plenty boring, believe you me. So, want to see the best one?' She nodded, following him to the deep candy red 2010 model sitting off and to the back. He smiled, showing opening the door and letting her get in. \"She was special ordered with all of the extras for some yuppie in the Valley when he up and decided he wanted a Pagani Zonda C12 F instead. The senior clerks actually have a betting pool going to see who can sell her the fastest.\" Chaos smirked, looking over her shoulder and seeing that two of the other clerks that had snubbed her and her father to cater to Selene were actually standing just outside of the showroom entrance trying to see how successful their newcomer was. She looked at him, smirk spreading into what she knew was a truly malicious grin. \"So . . . I never did catch your name.\" He looked puzzled as she leaned back into the driver's seat, checking the gleaming polished wood and chrome insets before looking back up to him. Finally, after shifting on his feet he answered. \"I'm Jacob, ma'am. Why?\" She looked back at the other sales clerks then up at him and winked. \"Because, I need to know who to tell your new manager to give this beautiful lady's final sale to.\" Two hours and an extensive amount of paper work later, Sphinx pulled back into Otto's lot, Mikhail following closely in Eleanor . But for once the sleek and trim Shelby GT 500 wasn't the center of attention. It was the gleaming candy apple red Aston Martin One-77 that Sphinx was driving, with its bone white and charcoal interior with bits of chrome and polished wood throughout. He turned, smirking at the still sulking Chaosia as she got out and walked straight to the stunned Memphis and Atley. She flipped her hair over her shoulder, obviously snubbing her smirking boyfriend and cackling half-brother who tossed Memphis his keys. Memphis looked at the two now chummy boosts as Chaos glared at them, finally giving into the temptation. \"Okay. What did we miss?\" She glared even harder as Sphinx chuckled and Mikhail laughed even harder. \"She's just mad that Pops actually sided with me and Sphinx on the whole second car deal. And that we were all amazed that she picked a color other than black ! He said she owned too much of it as it was and he wasn't buying her another black car . . . so it's good thing she picked the red one.\" She huffed, turning to Atley, still ignoring the two she'd come back with. \"I only have the Carbon Black V12 Vantage at his home in England and the SS. Besides, he drives the Vantage more than I do. Even if I am in London! One more wouldn't have hurt!\" Sphinx shook his head and pulled her into him, whispering to her. She blushed and hit him hard in the shoulder. \"Really Sphinx ! There are days I wonder why I ever wanted you to speak!\" He laughed, causing the others to pale and Chaos to grumble. \"And they still look at you like you're crazy when you do that. Seriously did you ever speak at all before I came around?\" He shrugged, not taking her foul mood to heart. He knew that as soon as her father and Mikhail had doubled over laughing and started aggravating her that her patience's days were numbered. And when Guadimus had started including him in the ribbing and picking, he could see her calm mood literally start to melt. She had lasted until her father had left though, amazing him. Now he knew there would be hell to pay, but mainly for her brother and father. Besides, he could always get back into her good graces with white chocolate, coffee and the promise of doing some horribly embarrassing and demeaning thing she wanted. Like going to eat at some sappy restaurant or go dancing. She'd been dropping hints to do that for a week now so he would probably make arrangements to do both after her father left. That way he wouldn't be forced into her adoring stepmother's company any longer than necessary. He sighed, pulling her reluctant form into his side and started rubbing her arm. Chaosia brought her foot down on his. Hard. Oh yeah. She was going to be hell to deal with until she'd exacted her pound of flesh from him as well. As soon as she saw Sway, she practically darted away from him and to the older girl, not even sparing her brother or him a parting glance as she disappeared into the paint dock, dragging the very confused boost with her. Mikhail looked at him, paling as he declared, \"Dear God, Sphinx. We pissed her off proper like, didn't we?\" Sphinx gave him a look that very clearly stated You did but I'm going to have to deal with too. Thanks. Ass . Mikhail just cleared his throat, looking back after his sister as Memphis and Atley started asking questions about the car and the day out. None of the men would have ever expected what was brewing inside the garage. \"I swear Sway, I don't know which is worse. Almost all of my boyfriends Dad and Mikhail both hate on sight . . . and to have both of them like one - the same one - is sort of . . . freaky.\" Sway laughed, handing Chaos one of the always stocked beers from the fridge in the back of Otto's office. She sighed, watching Chaosia take a long drink from the Miller Highlife, draining half of the bottle in one go. She could sympathize with Chaos on one level. Before she and Memphis had finally started dating, she had tried dating a few other guys after joining the crew. And every single one of the boys had reacted as badly as Mikhail the month prior. But when she and Memphis had finally given into their strong mutual attraction . . . it was just weird to see the other side of the crew. Always joking or playing and teasing until she came in or when they thought she wasn't listening. And then if they ganged up on her . . . She shuddered, glad to rid of that awkwardness and the long fights it had taken to be treated as an equal after they had to face she was a girl, and big girl at that. As Chaos drained the rest of her beer Sway handed her another, knowing she had always needed a stout drink and a night of fun after something like this happened . . . . She smirked, draining her own beer and tossing the empty bottles. \"C'mon Chaos, we're going to leave the men to fend for themselves for a night. Want to go get a drink?\" Chaos stopped, looking at Sway like she'd grown a second head before shrugging it off. \"Sure. Why not? We can take my new car if you want. You can even help me name her.\" Sway smiled, genuinely surprised and pleased at that thought. She'd always helped name cars for boosts but the only personal cars she'd christened had been her own. All of the others had this weird taboo that only they could name their own cars. Even if the names they picked sucked major donkey balls. \"Sure, hon. But I need to go shower and change. I doubt I could go anywhere covered in grease and dirt and be allowed in.\" Chaos shrugged, offering, \"You can shower at my place. I'll even lend you whatever you want to wear. You can raid my closets . . . I actually have some leather pants and a few corsets form my clubbing days . . .\" Sway raised an eyebrow, intrigued by that prospect. Chaosia in leathers would probably be one of the oddest or hottest things anyone could ever see. She smirked, suddenly wondering if Sphinx knew his girlfriend had a secret stash of club clothes. She'd have to ask later . . . As Sway gathered her things, Mikhail and Chaos were arguing. Apparently their plans might get canceled before they were ever in motion. \"I don't see why you can't wait. You know if Selene finds out you went out while they're in town she'll freak. Is that what you're trying to do?\" Chaos rolled her eyes and turned, obviously dismissing her brother and his half-cocked ideas, holding her hand out to Sphinx. \"Okay Quiet Man , give me my keys.\" Sphinx picked that moment to play dumb, raising a brow and refusing to give her the keys. She took a deep breath and counted to twenty in her head. Twice. If she could just get home, get dressed, get out and unwind they might live to see tomorrow . . . Otherwise she was not responsible for the aftermath . . . \"Do not give me that look, Sphinx. I would like the keys to the damn car that forced upon me. Now cough 'em up.\" He tossed her the keys, face darkening as she refused to back down or tell him what exactly she and Sway planned on doing. Sway picked that moment to come sauntering out of the garage, a wicked little smirk on her lips as she told Memphis, \"Don't wait up, Lover Boy . I'm going home with Chaos tonight.\" She looked the car over, a new light shining in her eyes as she winked at Chaos and Sphinx. \"You know, hon, if you look anywhere near as good as this beauty in those leathers . . . your boy may not get you back.\" Chaos smirked as Memphis's eyes glazed over along with Atley's. Oh yeah, they were gone. She shook her head, giving Sway a deadpan look as she got in the car. \"Uh-huh. I thought you only went for redheads .\" Sway shrugged, enjoying the sheer look of torture that her boyfriend was wearing. \"Yeah well, there are always exceptions to every rule. Besides, we've got the redhead don't we?\" Chaos rolled her eyes, looking up at Sphinx. \"I'll be back eventually. Think you and my idiotic half-brother can manage to stay out of trouble?\" Sphinx nodded, clearly a little upset over something . Oh well, he'd tell her eventually or he would get over it. That's just how he was. . . . She waved, pulling off and towards her apartment, Sway laughing as they pulled onto the back road. She smiled at Chaos, pulling her eyes away from the shrinking garage and its inhabitants. \"Let's open her up, Chaos. See what this gal can do !\" She nodded, shifting into gear as she laughed with her friend. To hell with the men . They'd caused enough problems for one day. This was the official beginning of their girl's night out. Okay. Here is an actual chapter. Sorry about the delay but clean up has been a bitch and a half. At least my house wasn't trashed. . . But anyways . . . up next is a girl's night out . . . Whoohoo! Later.[Chapter 18] Okay, here's Chapter 18. I'm not so sure about the last chapter now that I re-read it but if I chose to edit it and change it I'll add a note or something in the next chapter. Anyway, I won nothing save my OCs and my Chevelle so please don't try to sue. You won't get anything anyway. Thanks for the well wishing Inferno. Oh and both v20 and the Aquarium of the Pacific are actual places in Long Beach CA. Check them out online if you need to visualize what's going on. Enjoy! Louder Than Words Sway watched in wonder as Chaosia pulled hanger after hanger of clubbing clothes from the back of her guest room's closet. And not just pieces. Oh, no. Fully matched outfits and dresses with little bags of accessories and shoes hanging off of the very expensive lined hangars. Sway looked to Chaos, amazed. These clothes belonged to the borderline tom-boyish girlfriend of the Sphinx ? Chaos set out the last outfit, bringing the number to almost twenty if Sway had kept a proper count, and turned to her, hair flipping over her shoulder as she did so. She had pulled her hair out of the low pony tail and curled the multicolored tresses into huge ringlet curls to frame her face and neck as they fell to past her shoulders. She had a hangered outfit thrown over her shoulder, waiting patiently for Sway to browse and pick a \"cut loose\" ensemble. Apparently, Chaos actually had a group outing she was going to ditch to spend time with her family and Sphinx but since neither were in her good graces at the moment then she'd called and announced she was coming and bringing a friend. Sway was just glad to hear that Paul was going to this little gathering so she'd know tow people there and not be left feeling like the odd man-er . . . woman out. She sighed, looking over the outfits and trying to choose. After a few moments, Sway picked a very unusual black long sleeve dress. The upper scoop neck portion (which was low but actually showed no cleavage, just shoulders and neck) was made of a thin jersey knit while the tiered, slightly shimmery leather skirt with velvety trimming and a removable tie belt. The bags attached held a long gold necklace with a glossy iridescent blue-green koi fish charm that was designed to move with its wearer along with simple iridescent blue-green tear drop earrings and a matching gold, diamond and aquamarine koi cocktail ring. The shoes are what had Sway drooling though. They were a gorgeous blue-green snake skin stiletto with a 3 inch heel and a sharp pointed toe, perfectly matching the jewelry and the dress without being over powering. Sway looked to Chaos, who nodded smirking. \"Go ahead and try it on. I'm going to get dressed and finish up my make-up. I'll bring you my kit when I'm done, deal?\" Sway nodded, looking down at the shoes again. She and Chaos would definitely be going shopping together again sometime soon. She would love a pair of shoes like this in a black or grey or better yet, red. She smirked, taking her tee shirt off and tossing it on the guest bed, her jeans and socks following quickly. Memphis wouldn't believe the way she looked outside of her normal clothes. She used to go clubbing every weekend when she was younger and just starting to boost. It had been a great thrill to see all of the idiots that frequented the bars and clubs try and pick her and her now disbanded posse up for the evening. She sighed, pulling the dress off the hanger and slowly sliding into it, actually enjoying the feel of it. It sat just below her thighs, a good inch and a half above her knees. Just short enough to be risky without coming off as skanky. She smirked. Apparently Chaosia was a girl of many hidden talents . . . not the least of which was picking cute dresses that could make both of their boyfriends' jaws drop. She sat on the bed, pulling the stilettos on after donning the jewelry. Now all she had to do was touch up her make-up and do her hair and she would be good to go . . . She looked up to the sound of the door opening and had to do a double take. Sphinx was going to kill Chaosia for even thinking of going out in public without him if he saw her . . . Chaosia's hair was still framing her face and neck though her bangs were swept over one side in a Grace Kelly style. She had put on very natural make-up, save for her dark rimmed eyes and dark thick lashes. Her lips were glossed in a nude pink and shiny as she smirked. But her dress . . . Lord her dress. Chaosia was decked out in such a shimmering pale aquamarine sequined cocktail dress that it was almost white. The dress had thick shoulder covering straps that made the top and met in a deep V-neck in the front and back. The fitted A-line skirt drifted to almost mid-thigh length, making it short and sassy but still somehow sophisticated. What got Sway though were the allover striped sequins over the already iridescent material that shone whenever Chaos moved. That, coupled with a colorful long necklace with a cluster of assorted beads followed by a metal tassel and matching earrings, as well as the huge diamond cocktail ring she seemed to live in, made her seem more ready for 5th avenue than a night of dancing and drinking. . . She tossed Sway her make-up bag, coming to sit beside her on the bed. \"Do want me to pin your bangs back? The rest will look fine if we do that.\" Sway nodded, allowing her to pin and twist her hair until her bangs were up in a small pomp and the rest of her hair fell in tousled curls and waves. She looked at herself in the mirror, having to admit to herself that Chaosia definitely had a style about her when she wanted to . . . and it apparently transferred to others too. Chaos turned, smirking as she grabbed a white clutch from a drawer in the closet organizer. \"Ready to go?\" Sway nodded, grabbing the make-up to finish on the way. They were heading by the Anchor then they were going on to meet Paul and his friends at another club near downtown. Sway was amazed as she and Chaosia were ushered through the rope at v20. The door man hadn't even flinched when Chaos had waved and said they were meeting a group before letting them pass. HE did, however, check both of their asses as they walked by. Chaos didn't seem bothered as she pulled Sway through the circular bamboo tunnel then up and towards one of the back sets of white leather couches. Paul was already seated with a tray of glowing blue martinis in front of him, one of Chaosia's soccer buddies seated beside him. Both were dressed in white pants and pale blue shirts. Sway looked over the others gathered. Apparently there was a theme to this gathering as the some odd fifteen people (of all ages no less) were dressed in some combination of black, blue and white. Orsinio was seated across from Paul, a bottle of Heineken already in hand, and motioned for them to join him as he scooted to make room. Sway smirked. The boy was too cute as he blushed and introduced himself again, stuttering slightly as she explained they'd technically already met. He recovered quickly, however and handed both women a martini. Sway grinned at the glowing drinks and the easy way Chaos integrated into this setting. She had never seen her so comfortable , even in her jeans and track jackets. But as she talked and laughed and drank, socializing to the best of her abilities (which was apparently pretty damn well) Sway was beginning to realize some of the aspects the girl actually sacrificed for Sphinx. Chaos was definitely a social creature when she wanted to be. She might be awkward around their crew at Otto's . . . but she flourished and thrived among her own friends. Sway smiled, truly enjoying getting to see this side of her new friend. She doubted even Sphinx had seen her like this yet. She turned to Paul, asking, \"So what's the occasion?\" Paul, true to form, raised his half empty martini glass and almost doused his poor cohort Andrews. \"Why, to our wonderful Tobin getting his internship at the Aquarium of the Pacific of course!\" He laughed, downing his drink as the dreadlocked boy rolled his eyes before turning to Chaos. \"So, I thought you were spending time letting your Dad and your boyfriend get to know one another. What's wrong? Daddy Dearest threatening to Tag-and-Bag again?\" Chaos snorted, draining her first drink before grabbing another. \"More like they get along too well. Apparently it suits him that I'm dating someone 'older and more stable' to balance me out. Seriously, they spent the whole day making jokes with Mikhail and aggravating me near to death. I almost killed them at the damn car dealership and we weren't even there four hours.\" Tobin nodded, laughing. \"Well, at least he likes him . . . Did your boy like your Dad or is it too early to tell?\" Chaosia chuckled, waving a waitress over to get Sway a Heineken to match Orsinio's. \"Yeah, Sphinx liked him okay. I think it did him good to just hear someone else with an English accent you know?\" Paul perked, honing in on the conversation as most of the group left to dance. \"Oh! So the new guy's English? Well, well, well, Chaosia. You have certainly come a long way. What happened to never dating a stuck up Brit, hmm?\" Chaos gave Paul a deadpan look before rolling her eyes and waving his question away. \"Please. The day Sphinx is a stick up Brit is the day you become the Virgin Mary. I don't mind Brits or Englishmen. Hell, I am part British . . . but I can't stand most of the people in the nobility and the 'higher caste'. They're so bloody boring . Besides, I wouldn't care if Sphinx was a prince in disguise I would still love him to death, you know? He's just so different from anyone else I know. And he's honest. Brutally honest. And he's satisfied with just being himself. That makes all the difference.\" Tobin looked on, perplexed as Paul nodded sagely and Sway had to ask, \"Why?\" Chaos smirked, winking as she stood and held a hand out to Sway to join her on the dance floor. \"Because if he's sure about himself then he's sure about what he wants. And it's not too likely to change. Plus it means he doesn't expect me to change and he's content with me just like I'm content with him. Now. Enough damn talking, I'm here to drink and dance and you are coming along for the ride!\" And with that, she drug Sway and Paul onto the floor, the latter bellowing the words to the song playing as he pranced around the floor. And he just couldn't understand why everyone thought the tall blonde dude singing Lady Gaga's Telephone was so weird . . . or doing the video choreography to go along with it. Sway was laughing as Chaosia tried to open her door. Apparently it was harder than it looked to get the damn key to work when she supporting her very tipsy friend's weight and juggling both of their purses. Chaosia sighed, shaking her head smiling as she finally got the door open. She'd made it three steps in when Sway fell flat on her ass, laughing. Chaos steeled herself before bending and scooping her still laughing guest over her shoulder and kicking the door closed with a heeled foot. Apparently forcing Sway to have those last eight drinks hadn't been a great idea now that she thought about it. She carried Sway down the hall, depositing her on the guest bed and taking off her shoes and jewelry, returning them to their bags before covering her with the comforter. She could get the dress tomorrow but for now Sway needed to sleep this off or she would be sure to half the hang over from hell tomorrow. As she went to close the door she heard a knock, causing her to look back and check on Sway. Nope. Still out cold and smiling like a loon. She heard it again and sighed. Oh well, better go face the firing squad. She came down the hall and to the patio doors, opening them to let her boyfriend inside as she went to start a pot of coffee. If she could take some ibuprofen now with a cup of strong coffee then all of the alcohol she'd consumed wouldn't consume her brain tomorrow morning . . . She turned, noticing Sphinx had changed clothes. He had on his favorite dark lounge pants and dark grey tank top, showing off his broad chest and shoulders as well as his trim waist. She sighed, sidetracked for a moment before returning to her task. Hot coffee now hot boyfriend later. He walked up behind her, letting her start the pot before spinning her to face him. She looked up, smiling tiredly as he looked down at her. She'd literally danced and laughed her earlier aggravation and anger away with Paul and Sway, leaving only a nice tired feeling in its wake. He dipped his head, taking in her dress with hungry eyes. She felt herself blush under his stare, knowing that he'd never seen her in anything like this dress before. He pulled her into his chest, hands cupping her derriere as he lifted her up and placed her on her kitchen counters, bringing them almost eye level. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth, worrying the flesh as she watched him watch her. Finally, he pulled her closer and kissed her, sucking her bottom lip into his own mouth and soothing the now abused flesh with his tongue before releasing her. She blushed but dropped feather light kisses along his chin and jaw line. He sighed, leaning into her kisses for what seemed like an eternity before he finally spoke. \"I take it this means you're not angry anymore, then.\" She shrugged, kissing down his throat and scraping his Adam's apple with her teeth before answering. \"No, Sway and Paul helped me work off my aggressions . . . and realize it's a good thing you and Dad get along. Even if it is too well. So I'm sorry for overreacting. As usual. Honestly I don't know why you put up with me sometimes . . .\" He smirked, catching her face in his hands and kissing her hard. She could feel her lips bruising under his lips' assault but couldn't have cared less. He always seemed to leave her lips kiss swollen . . . When they parted for air, he rested his forehead against hers. \"Girlie, you have no idea what you do to me do you?\" She shook her head, still a little light head from the sheer emotion behind his kiss. Where in the hell had that come from? He continued, bringing a hand to cup the back of her head as he slid the other down her cheek to her throat then down her chest and torso to rest on her hip, holding her as close as he could without actually hurting her. \"I can't remember the last time I had to meet someone's parents, Chaosia. And I have never wanted anyone to welcome me on their terms. Not as much as today .\" Her breath hitched as what his words meant sunk in. He really had tried to make a good impression on her father and behave, even when they'd all started picking at her. For her. She smiled, kissing him lightly on the lips as she slid her arms around his shoulders. He relaxed into her, kissing her back as she wrapped her legs around his waist. She sighed as they parted and rested her cheek on his shoulder. \"I love you.\" He rubbed her back, holding her to him as he laid his cheek against her curls. \"I know, girlie. And for the life of me I can't figure out why . . . but I aim to figure it out.\" She chuckled, swatting him as her coffee pot beeped, announcing its completion and the birth of super strong hangover preventing coffee. \"Well, while you figure it out why don't you get two cups while I go change into some pjs. We can cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie.\" He rolled his eyes but moved to do as she asked while she hopped of the counter and disappeared down the hallway into her bedroom. When Chaosia emerged a few minutes later, decked out in just his Wales tee shirt, he was already on the couch with two cups on the table (with coasters no less). She smiled, going to sit beside him. Sphinx, however, was having none of that and scooped her up mid drop and pulled her into his lap, forcing her to straddle him. His hands went to cup her ass under the tee shirt as he leaned up, kissing her again. She sighed, kissing back and letting him hold her against him. As she went to pull back from him, he rolled her beneath him and started kissing and suckling from her neck down to her chest. She giggled, trying to push him up only to have him pin her hands above her head with one hand and run the other up her thigh to her waist. She moaned as he grinned down at her. He loved hearing her make that sound . . . mainly because he knew she only made it for him. He kissed her again, swallowing another throaty moan as his hand slid down and between them, barely brushing her in its pass over her flesh. As they parted once more, she whispered \"I love you, Sphinx but if you don't quit teasing me I may just burry you.\" He chuckled, kissing her chest right over her heart. \"I love you too, Chaos. And you won't make good on that threat. You'd miss me too much. Besides . . . I'm not teasing . . . merely warming up is all.\" Much later, as they laid her bed curled together Chaosia realized exactly what Sphinx had said in the living room. She looked up from his bare chest, watching him sleep. She'd been so caught up in the gravity of him and his pull that she'd barely just caught what he'd said to her. She smiled, kissing his chest before settling back and into him. She doubted she'd hear it often (if ever again) but it warmed her to her core to know he felt the same way . . . even with their differences and issues. At least she knew and he had said it. It didn't matter if he said it much . Besides . . . with him, actions usually spoke louder than words . . . even the three she'd wanted to hear. Okay, So a friend of mine wants me to write another story with Chaos but with her being with the crew from the beginning. And at first I was relunctant wbut now the idea is actually starting to sound kind of cool. If anyone has an opinion let me know. The other story wouldn't take away from this one and would be its own alternate line . . . Besides there aren't too many stories that deal with the Old School crew before the Calitri boost . . . Okay. Later.[Chapter 19] See! I told you guys I wouldn't abandon it! Okay. On with the show. Swayed Discoveries The sun was evil. That was the only thing Chaos could even think about letting cross her pain riddled mind as she rolled and buried her face into the side of her snickering (yes, honest to God snickering) boyfriend, trying to shield her eyes from the unforgiving and brutal rays of light. She groaned as she heard another poorly concealed bout of snickering. Oh, she would kill him when she could move. Sphinx was still in her bed, stretched out beside her with this smug and self-satisfied look proudly displayed on his features. Chaos smacked his bare chest, causing him to chuckle darkly and roll her directly into the patch of sunlight that she'd been trying to escape. Her groans turned into whimpers as the marching band in her head started a whole new routine, complete with symbols, percussions and what sounded like a canon and firework accompaniment. Oh why did she even think about drinking that much gin? Sphinx apparently cued into the fact that this wasn't her normal refusing-to-wake-up-on-a-Sunday-morning drill and pulled her back into his chest, rubbing soothing circles along her spine and neck. She whimpered again, causing him to (gently) force her to look at him. He was worried, she could tell. And being macho enough that he wasn't going to say anything (not that he usually did but still). She grimaced and buried her face in the crook of his neck, trying to block out the bright sunlight and burrow herself into the comfort his presence offered. She'd deliberately kept him as far away as possible when she'd been 'being a normal bloody woman', as he'd taken to telling her when he'd become aggravated with her, so he wouldn't see her hurting or being weak. But now she knew she couldn't save face with this monster hangover so she decided to just admit defeat and let him see she was hurting. Besides, he might uncharacteristically take pity and bring her a gun to end her misery rather than revel in it. She chanced a glance at his face. His normally serious-but-handsome features were drawn taut in a dark scowl, making her shudder and burrow into him again. Well. There went that hope. He disentangled himself from her, leaving the bed and redressing in his lounge pants and tank top before disappearing down her hallway. Oh great. He was just going to leave her here with this hangover and go back to his apartment to laugh at her stupidity. Not that she wouldn't deserve it for not taking her usual precautions . . . She stopped, trying to remember last night through the haze of pain and residual alcohol. Hadn't she brewed a pot of coffee and gotten out her ibuprofen to take before going to bed? She was sure she had set the pot up and hit the button while she and . . . She growled, swearing. She was going to kill him and dismember his corpse! He'd stopped her from completing her only line of defense against the gin trying to work its way out of her system with his lusty glares and wandering hands. She couldn't even remember turning the damn coffee pot off. God, she was lucky she still had an apartment! She was so busy plotting his demise that his return to the bed caught her off guard, causing her to jump and squeak. That made her head hurt even worse and him chuckle even louder. Oh he was . . . She looked up, seeing the bottle of ibuprofen and steaming cup of what smelled like coffee that could kill an elephant. He was her hero. She greedily accepted the pills and downed half the cup of coffee, not caring that it scalded her throat or the roof of her mouth and tongue on its way down. Sphinx took the cup and sat it on the bedside table, resituating himself in bed so she could lay her head on his chest. She sighed, enjoying the moment despite the throbbing in her skull. As she lay there, she couldn't help but feel like something important had happened last night that she was forgetting. Something to do with them . She shrugged, closing her eyes and reveling in his fingers travel through her curls. She loved it when he played with her hair . . . Her eyes shot open and she felt him tense beneath her as she jolted into full consciousness. He looked at her like she was crazy while she tried to settle back down and act like nothing was wrong. He'd told her he loved her last night. Oh sure, he was being sarcastic when he'd told her but that was just him . Besides, Sphinx didn't strike her as one to just volley that particular phrase around for the hell of it. She looked up at him, noticing that he'd closed his eyes as he ran his fingers through her hair lazily. She smiled. Today was going to be great if they could just stay like this in bed. No worries, no family or friends. Just them and the simple, blissful knowledge that they had each other. \"Good morning, Mr. Sphinx. Thanks for the hangover relief attempt . . . I love you.\" He cracked an eye at her before leaning down and kissing her hair, settling back into her mass of pillows and closing his eyes. \"I know, Love. Now go back to bloody sleep. It's only seven in the morning.\" She sighed, shaking her head. Of course he would find a macho manly way to say it without saying it. But it didn't bother her. She knew and she'd heard it (if her alcohol drenched memory was anything to trust) and that was all that mattered. She closed her eyes again, letting the steady beat of his heart lull her to into a light sleep. Sway sat straight up, looking around the unfamiliar room quickly as she took in three major facts. One: she wasn't dressed right. Hell she was dressed in a dress and . . . she turned, catching her reflection in the mirror on the dresser beside her bed. She had what seemed to be the remnants of make-up on her face and the dress was not something she owned. Two: Her head felt stuffy and full, meaning that she'd consumed enough alcohol to almost give her a hangover. She rubbed her forehead, moving to stand as she looked around the now all too bright room again. Who was she drinking with? She hardly ever drank anything other than beer with Memphis because it was something they could both enjoy and partake off without one having to babysit the other later. She slowly got up and spotted her normal clothes, folded and sitting on the dresser. She sighed. At least she could put her jeans and tee shirt back on. After redressing, she laid the dress out on the dresser and examined it. It was pretty but she'd never imagined someone she knew would have it much less convince her to ever wear it . . . Fact three quickly reasserted itself as she opened the bedroom door. Her throat felt like cotton and she had to get some water. As she made her way down the hallway she smelled coffee. She shrugged. Whoever would be able to tell her something to jog her memory and give her a cup of coffee to keep the headache she could feel mounting at bay. When she walked into the living room and saw the kitchen, she knew where she was. She was at Chaosia's apartment and she had gone out with the other girl last night to unwind because she'd needed it. Sway smirked as she crossed into the kitchen and procured one of the many coffee cups from Chaos's shelves. Frankly, they'd both needed a night away from the pressures of the crew and their boyfriends . . . Not to say that either were bad or overbearing but sometimes a girl just needed some time without all of the male influences . . . well, the straight ones anyway. She poured herself a cup and turned, noticing a bottle of ibuprofen on the counter beside the coffee pot. She sighed, opening it and taking two. Chaos apparently did think off everything. Speaking of which . . . where was the Dancing Queen? Sway shrugged, figuring Chaos had maybe gone back to her bedroom to tidy up before starting the rest of her day. Lord knows the girl had a thing about cleaning and organizing that had even Memphis and the Sphinx watching where they put things when they were in her home. She wasn't bad about it but you could tell sometimes that something being out of place could drive her bonkers . . . especially if she had company. As she made her way back down the hall to the guest room, she saw Chaos's door was cracked and sunlight was filling the end of the otherwise dark hallway. Try as she might, Sway just couldn't resist the curiosity that pulled her towards that door. She kept telling herself it was because she wanted to let Chaos know she was up and going to call Memphis to come get her . . . but she knew in the back of her mind it was just because she was nosy. She wanted to see what Chaos had done to her bedroom after their last shopping trip if anything. Needless to say what she found was not what she'd expected. But Lord help her, she was back down the hallway and digging her phone out of the borrowed purse from the night before. Because she had to have a picture to prove she wasn't just crazy and half drunk. Sway crept back down the hall, phone in hand and camera function at the ready. She quietly pushed the door open, thankful that it didn't squeak or creak as she got a little closer to the bed. Two more light and measured steps and she was beside Chaos's monster of a canopy, trying to figure out how to do this. There, sleeping soundly and spread across most of the bed was a very shirtless Sphinx. He face was turned towards Chaos who, mind bogglingly enough, was part-draped-part-curled around his chest, her head right in the crook of his neck. Her fingers were splayed right over the left side of his chest, moving ever so often in her sleep as she mumbled and cuddled closer. Sway almost died when Sphinx moved, just knowing she'd been caught. But when he just shifted and settled, she breathed again. His left hand had joined Chaos's and was rubbing the back of hers with his thumb while his right was still situated on the small of her back. God they were so cute! Sway shook herself, getting close enough to take the picture and doing so before she lost her nerve. She might support their relationship whole-heartedly but she knew Memphis and the others would've killed her to pass this up. Besides, maybe seeing that their terrifying friend could be gentle with the seemingly fragile girl was what they needed to get them to move past the shock that he was in a relationship period. It'd been over a month for God's sake. She shook her head, taking another picture of their joined hands before slipping out of the room and back to the front of the apartment to call Memphis. She smiled. She hoped that they looked as sweet asleep as Sphinx and Chaos did but she highly doubted it. The number dialed, she waiting through the rings until Memphis's sleep logged voice filled the phone. \"Sway? What's going on, you okay?\" She shook her head at his antics. \"Yeah Raines I'm fine. Just come get me. I'm at Chaos's apartment and I am so not waking her up.\" She could hear him start to wake up as he asked, \"Why?\" Sway chuckled, looking back down the hall. \"Oh because I know with as much as she drank her head might resent it. Now hurry up. Love you.\" She heard him mutter and respond before the phone went dead. She shrugged, sitting down on the sofa to wait. Hopefully, he could remember how to get here half asleep. Memphis trudged out of the elevator at Sphinx and Chaosia's building, a very disgruntled and sleepy Atley Jackson in tow. As they made their way down the hallway, he looked up at the ceiling before turning to Atley. \"Think he's alive yet?\" Atley looked up, running a palm over his face before shrugging. \"Probably not but who knows. Alcohol never has affected him the way it does us, the inhuman bastard.\" Memphis chuckled, nodding in agreement as they spotted Chaosia's bright door. His head didn't hurt, thank God, but he could tell by Sway's tone she was warding off a headache. And from what Mikhail (and Sphinx oddly enough after the seventh six pack of beer was broken out) had said, Chaos was a fish. Especially when she had someone to keep pace with. A nd Sway could keep pace with the best of them. He and Atley had all but died when Mikhail had called the others and the beer had been brought in. But Mikhail had been adamant about it, saying that they were not going to let the others have all of the fun. And thus had begun the drinking festival at Otto's. They'd cleared out over twelve six packs before they decided enough was enough. And the signal for enough was Mirror and Tumbler trying to do some weird dance to Lowrider. He shook his head. He neither needed or wanted that image this early in the day. Atley came around him as they got to the door raising his hand to knock before Sway quickly opened the door shushing them and pulling them inside. Both men looked at her like she was crazy before Memphis finally spoke. \"Uh, Sway? I thought I was coming to get you?\" She shushed him, dragging both of them down the hallway whispering. \"What are you doing here Atley?\" Atley shrugged, looking at the girl like she'd finally gone crazy as they stopped in front of Chaosia's bedroom door. \"Well, I stayed at Memphis's place because someone had to drive him home. He's got to take me to get my car . . . what are you doing ?\" She smirked, opening the door again to let them see the couple on the bed. Atley just looked on, amazed as Memphis looked ready to faint. She raised a brow, before turning and seeing why. They'd moved. Chaos was now completely on Sphinx's chest and his hand was on her ass, which apparently was barely being covered by one of his tee shirts. Their legs were now intertwined and Chaosia's head was on his chest, her lips spread in a sweet little smile as Sphinx played with her hair in his sleep. Atley looked at Sway. \"When did he get here?\" Sway shrugged. \"He was here when I woke up. I came in to tell her I was going and they were all\" she motioned to the bed with her hands, smirking. Atley chuckled. This was too good to pass up. \"Oh to have a camera. He'd never live it down! Especially with next April Fool's day. I could post pictures around his office at the Coroner's office and send pamphlets . . . We've got to take a picture.\" Sway looked at Atley, suddenly seeing why he and Sphinx were such damned good friends. They were both fucking evil . \"Uh, At? Don't you think he'd kill you for that?\" Atley shrugged. \"Nah, he's done worse to me. See, what I've been trying to tell you boys and girls all along is that the Sphinx has this killer sense of humor. And practically loves to torture people.\" Memphis nodded, still looking at the couple on the bed. \"Yeah but I'd be more worried about her , Atley. She could convince him to skin you alive if she took it the wrong way.\" Atley shrugged again, turning to go back down the hall. \"Nah, he'd miss me too much. Besides, I keep him out of too much trouble with her for him to kill me. So, who wants to leave the lovebirds alone and go get some breakfast?\" Much later in the afternoon, Chaos woke up feeling much better and had asked to go to Otto's to see if Sway was there. Sphinx, after showering and changing clothes, had agreed as long as they ate first. So that's how they came to be sitting in the front seat of the One-77 with huge Sonic cups and the remains of Chaos's breakfast sandwich. Sphinx just rolled his eyes, tossing the bags out and into the carside trash can. \"I meant a proper meal in a proper place, Chaos. Not grease and caffeine.\" She shrugged, munching on the last of her fries before handing him her bag to toss. \"I know but this is honestly the best for a hangover. Besides, it just proves I'm a cheap date.\" He snorted, rolling his eyes as he took a long drink of the huge cherry coke she'd order for him. Against his will. She just couldn't believe that he'd never had one so she had forced it upon him. Like she did many things she thought he needed to experience. Like movies and food. And her father. He looked over, watching as she shook her hair loose of the ponytail she'd put it up in earlier. He had to admit it, if even just to himself. Her in dresses and heels was nice but she would always appeal to him more how she was dressed today. Loose distressed jeans with a fitted plain white tee shirt, brown leather belt and flip flops. Her glasses perched in her hair since she didn't need them right that second. No make-up and her freckles (a gift from boating and tanning that he found irresistible) shining on her nose and cheeks. She turned, raising a brow at him as she cranked the car, putting it in reverse. \" What? Do I have something on my face?\" He smirked, shaking his head before leaning over and putting the car back in park. She looked at him, perplexed. \"Uh, Honey? I have to put he car in reverse to-\" He cut off her rambling with a long steady kiss, enjoying how she gave in and wrapped her arms around his shoulders. When they parted, she looked at him even more confused. \"What in the world was that for?\" He shrugged, sitting back and looking out the passenger window, intent to remain silent on his reasons. She looked at him, shaking her head as she put the car back into gear and pulled out of the spot. As she shifted, she told him, \"Okay. Not that I'm complaining but warn me next time. I don't think my heart can handle the sneak attacks.\" He grinned darkly before nodding once. She glowered, grumbling as she sped to Otto's. \"Oh great. Now he's going to do it just because he thinks it'll aggravate me. Maybe I should tell him doing laundry aggravates me.\" He shook his head. At least she wasn't pissed anymore. Maybe he should send her off with Sway more often. Okay, this story is close to twenty chapters long now and had officially taken on a life of its on. Hope you liked it. I'll try and get the next one up a little quicker. Later.[Chapter 20] See! I told you I wouldn't forget! This chapter refused to take shape quickly so sorry it took so long. Now, I wanted to explain that Chaosia and Sphinx met in late October so this would be around the right timeframe for what I plan on. Hope you enjoy. Exits and Entrances Chaosia was nodding as she walked her father and stepmother towards their gate at the airport, listening to the man drone on and on about how she had to come to London for the season (which was only mere weeks away) and that her grandmother was just dying to see her. And that when she came, she was to bring Sphinx. She smirked at the thought of all of the carnage her towering glowering boyfriend could produce in the middle of the socialite circuits . . . then shuddered as she realized that she would have to be there to witness said carnage. She hated the London Seasons almost as much as she had hated being a Deb for the summer she'd visited her Gram when she was eighteen. It was the only thing the woman had ever asked of her and she couldn't find it in her heart to deny the crotchety old bat that, regardless of the fact that she usually made her life miserable (unintentionally of course because a proper British Lady was never malignant or petty deliberately, it was uncouth). She sighed and nodded, hugging her father for the millionth time since they'd gotten to the airport. She was going to miss him in spite of the fact that he and her brother and Sphinx together had just about driven her insane . . . even after he'd bought her the damned car. The whole time that the three of them had been exposed to one another and enjoyed (well her dad and Mikhail had anyway) being around the others, she had been silently praying for the days to tick by a little quicker. And now that she was here to see her father off she was painfully aware that she wouldn't see him again until she went to London. She loved him and loved to spend time with him but damnation why did he have to be so annoying when he was around other males? Thankfully Sphinx and Mikhail both had to work (through some very serious begging to Junie and Otto on her part) so she could say goodbye in peace. Selene came from around her father, rolling her eyes and shooing him away to hug her. She smiled indulgently and returned the hug, still surprised by that turn of events. Selene was still snooty and snobbish but when the two of them had been faced with Mikhail and her Dad, who were taking things to a whole new level of extreme since they had an unsuspecting but willing accomplice in the form of her usually stoic and reserved boyfriend, they had put most of their issues aside and joined forces for the sake of their sanity. Chaos had to admit, she might not always (okay hardly ever) like the woman but she was damn devious when it came to getting her father to do what she wanted . . . as long as her ego didn't get in the way. Selene pulled back, smiling at her with said devious look in her eye. \"Just don't bring Mikhail with you honey. My heart can't handle him and Shinobi with your father. Lord knows I'll be gray even faster.\" Chaos laughed and shook her head, her smile falling into a sad little smirk as the stewardess announced that their plane was boarding. Selene hugged again quickly before shooting to the boarding ramp, telling a stewardess very quickly that as soon as she was seated there had better be the largest dirty vermouth martini known to man waiting on her. Her father laughed, shaking his head and hugging her tightly . \"Sorry we got carried away, Duckie. I know we were a hand full but it was too much fun having someone to . . . well . . .\" Chaos nodded, waving away the apology. \"I get it Dad. You had people to act like a normal idiot with instead of a noble one and you got carried away. I get it and while I'm sure I'm minus a few handfuls of hair . . . I enjoyed it. Besides, what else but you three idiots could've made me and Selene actually get along?\" He laughed hugging her again before turning to board the plane. He called over his shoulder to her. \"I knew all it would take are the right circumstances. And I also know that the next time you see each other you'll be back at the other's throat, right?\" She shrugged. \"Probably. But hey, you saw it once before you died right?\" Edward Guadimus was rolling his eyes as Chaos laughed. He turned back to her once he got to the door, smiling. \"I like him Chaosia. He's a good man . . . a bit severe and rough around the edges . . . but a good man. I approve, though I know you don't need it. And I am serious, I expect to see him in London with you for Christmas if he's able. Take care of yourself and each other. Love you more than the moon.\" She smiled nodding, knowing her eyes were probably watering now. \"Love you more than the stars, Dad.\" And with that, one of the most important men in her life was boarding the plane to carry him back across the Atlantic. She watched the plane roll out, wiping at her eyes occasionally until it had pulled up and into the clouds, heading back to London. She sighed again, grabbing her bag and going to leave the airport. She needed to be on her way anyway. She was meeting Sphinx at the Coroner's office and they were going to lunch. As she made her way out of the main entrance and exit to Long Beach Airport, she started thinking about how to approach Sphinx with the invitation (e.g. order) her father had issued. She knew why he wanted him there. To meet the rest of the family and especially Gram. Something about putting the two of them in a room together made cold chills go up and down her spine. The matriarch of her family was tempestuous at best and hardly ever warmed up to newcomers. Hell, she and half the family was still amazed that she got away with calling her Gram instead of Lady Guadimus or Grandmother. She spotted her parking complex and started towards the car, forcing herself to look for the gleaming red instead of black and white. Even though her SS was up and running her father had refused to let her drive them to the Airport in her . . . siding with Selene on how unseemly the car was. She laughed tightly and almost forced the issue until she let it go, deciding to just park the Aston and indulge herself with her precious SS after her lunch date. Speaking of lunch date . . . She looked down to her lightwashed mini-flared jeans and the dazzling green snake skin heels peeking out from under them as she dug her keys out of her pocket. The jeans were cut like trousers and had this edge to them that she loved. Her white silk shell tank seemed to grow the multi-colored Dynastic flora print, the pintucked bodice showing her trim waist while the ruffled and lacey hem managed to seem feminine. Her cropped tan and white seer sucker blazer was pressed to perfection with the lacey trim hanging from underneath the hem. That paired with the ¾ sleeves and her long chained golden locket had taken her forever to pick out and feel comfortable in. She had to go in and get Sphinx and while she knew that he wouldn't have cared if she came in jeans and a tee shirt with one of her million track jackets she did. She'd heard from Atley about how the others in the morgue always seemed to have this attitude where Sphinx was concerned that the man was crazy and dangerous . . . but after they eaves dropped on his phone call about their first coffee date he'd had to practically scare them into submission to get some semblance of the peace and quiet he craved. And while neither Atley nor Sphinx would elaborate on what comments were made (both going the silent route for once) she knew from Atley's slip that they had been made. And they weren't favorable to either party involved. She got in and started the car, pulling out to exit the complex. As she waited in line to redeem her parking slip, she checked her make-up in the rearview mirror. She'd gone ultra-natural and feminine with barely there shadow that glimmered when the light hit it just right and extremely dark mascara to play up her long, full lashes. Simple blush and glossy nude lipstick had completed the look. Her hair, now even lighter because of her time in the unusually hot California autumn sun, was curled and styled with her nags sweeping over her forehead and away from her face, falling in huge ringlets down her back. She nodded at her reflection before rolling her eyes at the absurdity of the action and pulled up to hand the man in the booth her ticket. Lord she hoped that what she was planning to do went well . . . and that her boyfriend didn't kill her for attempting it. Sphinx worked quickly and quietly, stitching the last few centimeters of the Y incision closed under the watchful eye of his new assistant. Lord save him from grad students and their knowledge. He glowered as the mop of dark auburn curls got into his line of sight. Again. The girl, who had to be about Chaosia's age, was to put it plainly odd. She'd walked into the office this morning with her rotation assignment and the senile director had put her with him instead of the other pathologist. And while he usually would have just taken the man's decision and gone with it, this girl was absolutely driving him up the wall. She'd already bounced around the bloody room and introduced herself to every male employee (something that didn't escape his notice) and had been steadily getting closer and closer to invading his personal space with the passing of every second. And if he had to hear her damn heels click on the damned floor one more time he was going to throw her in one of the drawers and leave her there for one of the others. Who in the hell wore three inch heels to work in the morgue anyway? He growled lowly, pushing her slightly to the side as he snipped the finished incision, knowing his eye was twitching as she giggled. He looked up, shaking his head mentally at the way she was dressed. A super short mini skirt with some frilly pink monstrosity of a shirt that showcased way more than he wanted to see. He may be male but he wasn't stupid enough to think that if Chaos ever even thought he'd been interested in this . . . girl he'd be minus a girlfriend. She smiled at him, glossy lips spreading to reveal pretty white teeth as her green eyes danced with what looked like appreciation that he'd glanced at her. He sighed, shaking his head and silently thanking God that Chaosia had never acted like that. Ever. \"So Mr. Sphinx? The others warned me that you don't talk . . . but I bet I could get you to. What do you say we go to dinner and practice ?\" He knew he was pulling a stupid shocked face. And for the life of him he couldn't school his features back into their normal disinterested scowl. Had this girl honestly just? Fortunately, Richards had walked in and saved him, staring dreamily at the girl as she looked him over once and dismissed him. \"Oh honey, Sphinx here has some girl already that's into the whole murderous mute thing . . . but you can go to dinner with me. I love to talk.\" She gave the man a deadpan look. \"I'm sure you do, Richie boy. But I happen to think the whole Tall, Dark and Silent thing is extremely hot.\" She turned back to gazing at him and Sphinx was suddenly very aware of the fact he was being judged like a piece of damn meat. The logical part of his brain was beginning to wonder if Chaosia would be too upset at him for hitting a woman while the definitively male side was practically preening at the attention. Good God he had to get out of this room or something horrible was going to happen. He just wasn't sure what. \"Besides, I'm sure your girlfriend doesn't look anything like me .\" That sentence brought him to rights faster than ice water. He might not be too much to look at (although Lord help anyone who said it in front of him) but Chaosia's looks were not up for debate. Especially with this woman. He felt his face fall into one of his darker glares of its own accord and he relished the way both idiots before him started to fidget under the weight of it. Well it was about bloody time . . . He was so intent on glaring at them that when Newman came in and announced he had a visitor he turned and growled at the man. What now? He glared at the three before stalking out of the room, aware that they were following and of the conversation behind him as he stopped and tossed the case file on his desk. \"Who's here for him?\" \"I have no idea but the receptionist is sending them back now.\" He groaned internally at the stacks already forming. Thank God Chaosia's family was going back today . . . maybe they could get some of this back paperwork pushed down now that they wouldn't be hosting her father and stepmother every five seconds. He grinned but quickly dismissed it and glared at the three shadows around the corner. Great. Another damned nosy busy body to follow him and annoy. And this one was stupid enough to think that the fact she was a she would save her if she tested him too badly. And that he would fall to her will. God, he needed a vacation. The sound of heels clicking lightly pulled his eyes up from the paperwork on the desk and glaring towards the doorway he'd come from. There were still three shadows there so who . . . A hand on his cheek brought him face to face with a smiling but worried Chaosia. He sighed, not caring who saw him lean into her touch as she beamed up at him, her other hand on his chest. He took in her outfit and make-up and was silently thankful that she'd dressed up with the idiots around the corner watching them. Her hair was curled and free, hanging down her back in long ringlets and waves. Her outfit was simple and feminine but classy, the heels she was wearing bringing her closer to his height. He couldn't help it, he smiled down at her and kissed her palm before removing it from his face. Lord he had needed to see her. The look in her eye said she knew something was wrong . . . she didn't voice the knowledge. It still amazed him that after so short an amount of time how they knew each other so well . . . but he wasn't going to question it. He was thankful for it today. \"Hey, Sphinx. So? Ready to go grab some lunch?\" He nodded, shedding his lab coat and grabbing his Members only jacket. He had a passing thought to go get his pea coat from the cleaners (which Chaos had taken without his knowledge) but lost it as she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him, square on the lips. It wasn't a lustful or overly passionate kiss, just a sweet brushing of her lips against his. Something she knew drove him up the wall because he couldn't stand the limited contact. It always made him want more . . . Oh to hell with it. He pulled her flush against him, disregarding the gasps from their onlookers as he slanted his mouth against hers roughly. Her hands went to mess up his hair while one of his went to the base of her skull and the other grasped her hip, firmly holding her as close as he could get. When they parted, she was flushed and her lips were kiss swollen but she was smiling, bringing her hands down to cup his face as he laid his forehead against hers. He knew he would be hounded for this but he didn't care. Not right now. \"I missed you.\" He smirked at her, shrugging his brows and dipping his head ever so slightly to the now silent doorway. She read his signs and grinned up at him darkly, winking. \"So? Think we might actually get to eat when we go home? Because I really am starving.\" A loud thud brought her attention to the door, an honest worried look crossing her features. And all he could think of was her on one of their beds and finishing what they'd just started. God, they needed to go. He'd take a long lunch so she could eat but the were going home and celebrating being truly alone for the first time in two weeks. \"What was that? Do you think everything is okay?\" He shrugged, pushing her towards the main door. Let the others deal with it. He had much better things to worry about. Chaos had known the second they pulled into the parking complex at their apartment building that something was up. Normally, if she met him for lunch (or dinner as was sometimes the case) they ate somewhere close and went their separate ways, regardless of how much they wanted to do otherwise. She looked over at Sphinx, suddenly glad they'd taken the Malibu and left the Aston at his work. Seeing him behind the wheel of the Astons was a great treat but seeing him in this car was one of her secret thrills about him. He looked like he should be behind the wheel of this car, all power and metal and speed. Not some fancy piece of fiberglass. And though she knew the Aston could go faster and wasn't just a piece of fiberglass (and he would probably throttle her for saying or thinking such blasphemy of a beautiful car), she still loved seeing him in the Malibu. Or in Eleanor . He cut the engine and got out, waiting for her to dot eh same before going towards the elevator up and into the building. He seemed okay but something about the set of her shoulders made her think that maybe today had been as hard on him as it had on her. But why would that be? He held the elevator for her and, to his credit, waited until the doors were completely shut before pouncing on her. Before she knew it, she was in between the polished veneer wall and a very hard body, his lips and hands taking purchase wherever they could find. As his mouth traveled from her lips to her jaw, he chuckled at the shudder than ran through her. Dear Lord he was being evil today. The second the doors opened to their floor, he was away from her and walking towards one of their doors, her keeping pace with him. She sighed when she saw it was her apartment and dug her keys out of her pocket again. He waited until she opened the door before scooping her up, kicking it closed with one foot and carried her down the hallway to her bedroom, all hands and mouth the entire way. As her back hit the sheets, she knew from the way he was looking down at her that neither were going anywhere else for the rest of the day. She was hoping he'd told someone at work before his lips descended upon hers again. But after they did, all clear thought was lost. Much later, with Chaosia spread across his bare chest, lazily tracing circles with her fingertips on his flesh, Sphinx told her about the ordeal with the new assistant. She sighed, listening to him as he played in her hair. She smirked. He did that in his sleep too. And though it left a huge tangle for her to deal with she wouldn't tell him to stop for anything in the world. She loved that he was slowly showing these little ways he liked to touch her or just be with her. It made her feel what he felt for her without having to voice it. She sighed as he finished, snuggling into his chest. This girl was going to be trouble if she didn't watch it. Sphinx was a good man and loyal to a fault but he was a man. Though from the sounds of it, the trouble would come from him dismembering her for touching him before screwing around with her. And though she knew it was crazy, that tidbit made her feel better. Hell, she might even help him hide the damned corpse if the girl was stupid enough to touch him. He sighed beneath her, pulling her tighter to him. \"I guess I should get ready to go back, then . . . unless you want to call and tell them I'm indisposed , Love.\" She smiled, kissing his chest before shifting to reach down and get her phone out of her jean pockets. She dialed the number, asking to speak with his supervisor directly. The elderly man was understanding, telling her to tell Sphinx not to worry, he still had at least a month of vacation time to use up before the end of the year. She hung up, looking to her boyfriend as he laid in her bed, visibly more relaxed now that he didn't have to deal with the three stooges for the rest of the day. \"There. You're free.\" He sighed, pulling her back into him. \"I need a bloody vacation from this shite or I'm going to go away for murder in the bloody first.\" She giggled, soothing her hands over his chest. \"So why don't you take one? Your boos just told me to remind you that you've got over a month of vacation time. Use it and go somewhere to relax.\" He looked down at her, brow quirked. \"And where is it you're wanting to go then?\" She blushed, knowing she'd been caught but it did open up the conversation she needed to have. \"Well . . . Dad did invite us to spend Christmas with them in London. We wouldn't be staying with them before you refuse based on that. He promised to open up the lake house and leave us in peace for however long we wanted to stay.\" He looked at her and she could see him weighing the options. \"I guess we could if you wanted. I could put in for the time tomorrow. Just through Christmas?\" She nodded, leaning up to kiss him. \"Thank you. I swear I thought you would say no.\" He shrugged, closing his eyes. \"I probably should but you want it. Besides, you have two very fine European Ladies I plan on acquainting myself with.\" She smacked him lightly, settling in to take a nap. As she was closing her eyes, she reminded him, \"Don't forget you have to take Toby and Mikhail out tonight. It'll be his first real boost.\" Sphinx snorted, already dozing. \"Yeah, heaven forbid Kip and Tumbler mess it up again. Want to go?\" She jolted awake, looking down at him. \"What?\" He opened an eye, looking at her. \"Do you want to go? You know wait with Sway at Otto's?\" She settled, feeling silly for thinking he'd meant the other. As curious as she was she knew he'd kill whoever taught her anything to sate said curiosity. Even Sway or Atley. \"Yeah sure. Just wake me up when you go to get ready.\" She laid her head back on his chest, kissing over his heart. \"I love you.\" He pulled her closer, holding her there as he kissed the top of her head. \"I know, Girlie. I know.\" She smiled, recognizing his patented Sphinx's version of I love you too, and drifted to sleep, her last thoughts on Christmas in London. I wonder what to get him? Yay! Okay, to explain about the other Sphinx is a guy no matter what and most guys (especially the straight ones) are going to at least semi-enjoy attention from an attractive female. It's how they respond to this attention that makes them a rat bastard or not. Which Sphinx proved he isn't. Just wanted to put that out there so no one will think I'm turning Sphinx into a dick or anything. Okay, enough rambling. Later.[Chapter 21] Okay. Part one of a three part update. I know. Um . . . please read all three updates before anyone tries to plot my death. I promise it all works out in the end. Turkey Talk Why did I agree to this? That's the only thought that kept looping through Chaosia's mind as she pulled the twenty five pound turkey from her oven, basting it with glaze for the fifth time in twenty minutes. She knew she was over basting the damn thing but she didn't want it to be too dry or too done for anyone that would be eating at Otto's. She sighed, sliding it back into the oven before going and checking on the mixture of seven casserole dishes and tubberware containers lining her counters on pot holders. The broccoli casserole and the sweet potato soufflé were both done and ready to be taken to the car. All they would need was fifteen minutes in Junie's oven and they would be table ready. The homemade macaroni and cheese and Dutch zucchini casserole were both at the same stage while the green beans, mashed potatoes and sweet glazed carrots that were already done from the night before. She nodded, looking back to the oven. Now if only the damned turkey would be done then they could leave. She heard Atley yell at the television in her living room and gave a long suffering sigh. Sphinx and Atley apparently had a long standing tradition to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas together drinking and watching football (of the American variety for Atley's sake) because neither had much family to speak of. Sphinx's only living kin (a younger brother) was in London and the two rarely spoke. And Atley . . . well Atley didn't really say and no one bothered to ask after one of his infamous Jackson glares. She walked into the living room and propped herself against the wall, watching the two. Atley was spread out on her loveseat drinking a beer and cheering as his team crossed the in zone line. Sphinx was sitting on her sofa, one arm tossed over the back, nursing his beer and rolling his eyes as Atley jumped up screaming, \"TOUCH DOWN !\" Chaosia would've missed the mirth and humor in his eyes had she not been watching him so closely. But it was there as he watched his friend do his own version of a victory dance around her living room. Lord save her if the rest of them were like this. . . The timer brought her attention back to the oven and she made her way to liberating the huge cooked bird. It still amazed her that Sphinx had broached the subject with her two days after her father and Selene went back to London. Apparently Otto and Junie were hosting Thanksgiving at the garage like they did every year (because Junie refused to have the ever expanding crew at her house despite their promises of good behavior . . . and Chaosia couldn't really blame her in the least) and Sphinx actually wanted to participate for once. Mikhail had already said he would eat with her then stop by to check on the guys and Sphinx seemed ready to agree to that plan if she'd refused. So she did the only thing she could and called Junie, volunteering to help cook food for the massive boost fest and bring it with her. Junie had been thrilled for the help and they had worked for the past five days making a menu everyone could eat from . . . Too bad none of the damned boosts would admit to knowing how to cook. Donnie was bringing potato salad so at least that was one down . . . And Tumbler and Mikhail were going in together to get the beer and drinks (because heaven forbid they have a function without alcohol) while Toby and Freb were going to bring some sort of dessert (store bought thank God). Memphis and Kip were just going to show up with Sway, seeing as in how since their mother had passed away last year the crew was their family . . . And Mirror was expressly forbidden from bringing anything. He could apparently mess up boiling water so no need to kill everyone with food poisoning, right? She sighed, shaking her head and putting the turkey in its carrier before turning to call for Sphinx and Atley to help run this to their respective vehicles. And running right into Sphinx. He was standing there, looking down at her with this weird look as she tried to get her heart back into her chest. She had to remember to put a damned bell around his neck . . . Finally, she looked up, asking, \"Yes dear ?\" He snorted, closing the distance between them smirking rakishly as he placed his hands on her waist, pulling her flush into him. He dipped his lips to press them against hers and all she could do was sigh and return he contact. She slipped her arms around his neck, holding him as he kissed her. He had been doing this a lot since the new intern had popped up; something about the way she acted made him realize how lucky he was or something like that was the line she'd been handed. Chaosia wasn't an idiot though. She knew that the tiny skirts and heels would be enough to drive any man up the wall and then some . . . she was just glad he was controlling himself. She pulled away, that thought souring their tender moment before she could stop it. She was fine until she had to think about him working with that girl all day every day. And though she was doing a damned Oscar worthy job of acting like it didn't bother her, she would be stupid to deny to herself that it did. She'd brought Sphinx lunch the day after he'd bailed on work. And God in heaven help that bitch if she'd crossed her about six years ago and could've afforded the night in a holding cell. As it stood, she was still mulling over the idea of asking Paul to bail her out with some of her savings if she ever caught that . . . that thing with her hands on her boyfriend again. Chaosia had rounded the corner at the morgue, dropping off enough of the pork roast she'd made for her and Paul's horror Pow-wow (which was actually more of an Andrews-wasn't-really-that-into-him-pow-wow) to feed Pharaoh's army only to see Sphinx as far against his desk as he could get with the intern (whose name she'd learned was actually Meghanne Carmichael but she preferred to label her the intern) as close to him as she could get. Running her hand up his chest and smirking at him in her tight little black skirt and an almost see-through white dress shirt that had to be two sizes too small. And tall, red fuck me shoes. Chaosia was many things but naïve and an idiot were not among them. She knew the only reason any woman would dress like that to handle corpses, tissue, organ and blood samples all day. And it had absolutely nothing to do with respect for the dead or a misguided sense of professionalism. Chaos had seen red. Blood red. And if the almost horrified expression on Sphinx's face hadn't registered . . . well she was in the right damn place to commit a murder. She'd used every bit of her meditation training and temper control (both hard learned lessons from inheriting her father's bad temper and her mother's love of any type of fighting) and cleared her throat. Causing the girl to jump back and almost snap her ankle from the impact on the heels. She handed Sphinx his dinner and glared the now sheepish girl down with one warning. \"If you so much as think about looking in his direction for any reason un-work-related . . . so help me God they won't be able to find the pieces I leave of you. Understand ?\" The girl had nodded and scurried away to one of the attendants, and Chaos had nodded to Sphinx and left. Now, every time he passed her it was some small physical display of affection or commitment. And while it should've made her feel better, it was actually starting to drive her crazy. He couldn't do this stuff before the Skank-a-Saur reared her ugly head so why did he insist on doing it now? It just seemed like he was placating her and she was literally about to snap. She stopped, collecting her thoughts and remembering for the millionth time that men and women were different. They thought differently and this was probably just an example of those varying thought processes. Besides, Sphinx hadn't done anything wrong. Yet. So she just needed to get a handle on herself. She knew she was being moody and near confrontational since the whole intern thing and she just needed to get a grip. She had a good loyal boyfriend who was going to spend two weeks in a London lake house with her over Christmas. Two whole weeks of just them and whatever else they wanted to do, with very little familial interruptions. She smiled up at him, leaning into his chest. Damnation she would be happy to get them to London and away from the morgue and school and the well-meaning-but-absent-minded-crew. Lord they only had four more weeks and then they could just relax and take it easy for a while. Lord let the weeks go by quickly . . . Sphinx looked down at her, holding her to him as he reached to brush hair out of her face. Chaosia was beautiful to him on her worst days but today, covered in flour from her pie with little smudges or white and cocoa on her cheeks she was damn near heartbreaking. He knew she'd kill him if he ever uttered how utterly appealing he found her to be while she was barefoot and baking . . . but he could relish the thought in private. She was just too damned cute to not look at when she was like this. He snorted to himself. He had added that word to his vocabulary after meeting her and she seemed to provide an example of it daily. But cooking? Her apron was smudged and stained and her curly hair was pulled back and out of her face, bangs pinned up top and the rest in a loose bun. She had on these vintage freshwater pearl earrings (a gift from Paul he'd been told) and the simple choker she usually wore. She wasn't wearing make-up but she was wearing this cute little sweet heart dress that was pale pink with the oddest cream lace trim. And the best thing was it was strapless and showed off her chest (which he loved). And it came almost to her knees (showing her legs which he also loved). Of course she had this white cardigan to go over it for when they went to Otto's . . . but in the kitchen he got to see her in the dress and the apron. Lord if he could convince her to just wear the apron for him once he could die a happy man. Especially with those white satin heels she had sitting beside the door for when they had to go. She smiled up at him, breaking him away from the lecherous thoughts he'd been entertaining. He was a goner and he knew that . . . but days like today made him realize it wasn't all that bad. She'd agreed to the gathering since they wouldn't be stateside for Christmas and had even jumped in to help Junie prepare the damned meal. He could positively hear Memphis moaning about Sway not cooking now. And he was looking forward to rubbing it in all of their faces that he had the perfect girl . . . . And he was doing everything in his power this week to ensure she was happy. Especially after Meghanne's stunt in the morgue. That was twice that only the thought and reminder of Chaos had saved him from making a damned fool out of himself. And Chaosia's warning was still fresh in his mind. And he suddenly knew exactly what was hotter than her in the dress and apron and bits of pie. Chaosia truly angry was a thing of beauty when it wasn't directed at him. And to see her being so damned . . . he didn't even think there were words to describe it. The tone of her voice had been like steel all wrapped in sugar and honey and it had left him hard pressed to stop seeing her as she'd been in the morgue. He knew now why Mikhail feared his sister's wrath more than anything, even Sway and Mirror's cooking. And while he knew that as her brother Mikhail would never fully appreciate the sight . . . he had to wonder if any of her exes had felt the same. Or if he really did just like to live dangerously. Probably the latter. He smirked down at her, nipping her nose with his teeth as she giggled, but he could see it didn't quite reach her sea glass eyes. That was something that had started the second she'd seen Meghanne all over him in the morgue. And while it wasn't happening as frequently, it didn't escape his notice that it was happening period. And for the life of him he hated the way that look in her eyes made him feel. Hell, if it'd make her smile at him again for real he'd skin the damned toothpick and bring Chaosia her hide. But he knew Chaos would just get upset and fuss about the blood in their apartments. So he was saving that particular plan for extremely desperate measures. Like introducing Atley to Meghanne next week. He knew it was a long shot but she seemed to go for the boost type and if he could set her sights anywhere but on him until London then he could keep his girlfriend . . . and his testicles. \"Penny for your thoughts, Big boy.\" He shook himself, shrugging and kissing her again quickly. \"I think I can't wait to eat that turkey. Smells divine, Love.\" Her smile did reach her eyes this time and he felt the relief wash over him. Just four more weeks till London and then they'd be free from this shite for a while. He watched her pull away and start handing Atley, who had the misfortune to walk in at the wrong time, plates and direct him to take the others. \"I just have to wash my face and slip on my sweater and shoes and we'll be good to go.\" Sphinx nodded, taking the turkey and two of the casserole dishes so she could go freshen up. He almost dropped them until Atley helped steady the leaning tower of food. Lord how did that girl manage to balance three huge plates but couldn't stay steady on her feet for over six seconds? As he and Atley started towards the cars, he had to shake his head. This was going to be interesting to say the least. And he hoped that the level of activity and insanity that usually surrounded the crew would keep both of their minds off of clingy interns and the like. \"So, what are you getting Chaosia for Christmas?\" Sphinx turned and looked at Atley like he was crazy. Chaos was driving her SS, having all but permanently parked the Aston since her baby was fixed, and had the turkey in the front seat . . . Leaving him and Atley and the rest of the food that wouldn't fit in her car and its trunk in the Malibu. Sphinx shrugged, checking the light again. Had they missed the damn thing turning green? Atley looked at him, nodding sagely as he took a deep whiff of the food. Sphinx could understand. Chaos had really out done herself this time and the mere smell was driving his stomach to gnaw on his spinal cord. Or so it seemed. He couldn't wait to get to Otto's and eat. \"Well, whatever it is it'd better be good with you going to meet her family and everything. I mean world class gratitude sex good . These people are yuppies, no matter what her father's like. So unless you want to embarrass her I'd suggest Tiffany's or Tacori.\" Sphinx turned and looked at his friend like he'd lost his mind. Both of those were damned jewelry stores. Jewelry stores that almost exclusively specialized in engagement and wedding sets. Did he seriously think that? Atley just smirked knowingly at him. \"I know the idea hadn't crossed your mind yet so I wanted to plant it. I know you two haven't been together long Sphinx but damn . . . I doubt there is another person out there even close to as compatible with you as she is. And I can see the wedding bells playing in her head Sphinx. Why else would she agree to letting you meet the family? New boyfriends don't fly across the Atlantic to meet people who aren't going to be part of their lives. Besides, you don't want her to slip away, right?\" Sphinx glared, stepping on the gas as the light turned green. He literally sped to Otto's grumbling the whole while as Atley cackled. Married! He didn't want to . . . they hadn't been . . . She hadn't even fucking said anything to him and Atley could tell?! Why in the hell would she want to marry him? He pulled into Otto's lot, parking the car and going to find Chaosia. She was going to answer this now. Chaos watched Sway twirl the ring on her left ring finger happily. Memphis had proposed (finally) and Sway was thrilled. Oh sure she was acting all nonchalant about it but it was easy to see the way her eyes glittered when she looked over at the eldest Raines. Who still had this dazed look on his face. Apparently, Memphis had been expecting her to say no. Sway held the ring out for Chaos to see it again and Chaos indulged her, examining the glittering diamonds intently as Sway giggled and explained (again) how Memphis had put the ring on her keys to her motorcycle in the ring box. And while that might not be the ultimate proposal for her personally, Chaosia had to admit it was a pretty ring. A simple mirror polished platinum band held three (rather large) princess cut diamonds that were flush mounted with the wide comfort fit band. Small engravings could be seen on the sides, adding something extra to the otherwise simplistic ring. All in all Memphis had done well picking it out. And Chaosia knew that it had set him back a great deal. Hell, she wouldn't be surprised if he hadn't boosted a few cars just to pay for the damned thing. But it made Sway happy. Chaos looked over to Memphis again, smiling to see him smiling as he watched Sway. And it apparently made him happy she had said yes. Chaosia sighed, secretly happy as Sway dashed off to show Atley and Junie her new trinket. She didn't know why but for some reason she doubted she'd ever see a ring like that on her own finger. Well, as long as she was with Sphinx anyway. He really didn't scream wedding marches and picket fences when you looked at him. And judging by the dark way he was looking at Sway's hand and Atley's grinning face, she could tell he wasn't too keen on the wedding bells in the future bit. Even someone else's. She sighed, not realizing that she'd been rubbing the very finger she was condemning to remain vacant with her thumb. She had wanted to get married one day . . . but she wouldn't ever ask Sphinx for something that would cage him in. She shook herself, turning to walk to her car and get her cell phone to take a picture of Sway's ring. Besides, they'd only be together just a little over a month. It was way too early to start thinking about weddings and the like. Even if it would be nice to be asked . She opened her door, digging for her phone as she kept an ear on the group inside. Everyone was fixing plates and getting their places together so she had a few minutes . . . She found her phone and grimaced, noticing the missed call icon. She flipped it open, calling her father back and getting his voicemail. She sighed, listening to the message before leaving her own. \"Tag, Daddy. You're it. Happy Thanksgiving. Love you.\" She closed the phone, turning to go back inside and running straight into Sphinx. She glowered up at him. She was so buying him a damn bell for Christmas. This settled it. He was glaring down at her intently, causing her to want to back up a bit. She smiled up at him sheepishly, stepping up to wrap her arms around his waist instead. She kissed his chest before propping her chin against it to look up at him. He still had the same severe expression. Lord, something had pissed him off proper. She decided to try and talk. Normally her chattering away about whatever would disarm him long enough for her to calm him down. And he needed to be calm. It was Thanksgiving . . . and she didn't care if he was British or not he was going to enjoy the American excuse for gluttony. \"Did Sway attack you with her new ring the story yet? Or was she just getting hold of Atley? I swear I'd have never thought Sway would want to get married but it shows that you don't always know someone as well as you think you do. She's positively on cloud nine. If she shows you the ring, Sphinx, just nod and act like its pretty . . . not that that should be hard, it really is a gorgeous ring. Memphis did good, you know?\" His glare darkened and she felt her own anger rising. Why was he looking at her like that? What in the world had she done from the apartment to the damned garage? She wanted to grab his shoulders and shake him. To demand to know what his sudden issue was . . . but she settled for raising a brow and crossing her arms. \"Yes?\" She was in no way prepared for what came out of his mouth. He'd read something way too wrong or was damned psychic. Because she knew she hadn't even hinted at anything. Hell she hadn't even thought of it until Sway shoved her newly acquired two carats under her nose and began regaling her with stories of the proposal and wedding plans. Didn't he know that that was normal for most women when another was recently engaged? \"Do you want to get married or not?\" She blinked, honestly confused. There was no way he'd just asked that. Not here with all of these people, their friends, hanging on the fringe to see what would happen. She must have heard him wrong. \"Excuse me?\" He growled and repeated himself, this time sounding even more aggravated than before. \"Do you want to get married or not?\" She narrowed her eyes at him, suddenly upset. She could handle him not speaking for days (honestly she enjoyed the peace and quiet), she could handle him not returning phone calls while doing illegal and stupid things (because honestly that was the only time he didn't answer her) and she could handle his inability to say three simple words (mainly because she knew they hadn't been together long enough for him to feel that way about someone like her). But by God she was not going to put up with whatever this was. Especially not today. This was Sway's day. \"Are you serious? Because if you are that's got to be the worse, piss poor proposal known to mankind. What do you mean 'do I want to get married?'\" He glared down at her and she glared up at him, neither budging. Finally, he spoke. \"I want to know. To straighten you out if you've got grand plans about it you're not telling me. Because I'll not have it. I don't want to get married, Chaosia. Ever.\" She looked up at him, shocked by what he'd just said. She could understand not wanting to get married right now. Hell, she didn't want to get married right now. They didn't know each other well enough and it would put a strain on their relationship to do so. She knew she loved him and wanted to keep him as long as he'd be kept . . . but for him to just say that and to act like this . . . And she didn't even say anything about it . . . She looked away from him as her phone rung, announcing her father was trying to call her back. She silenced it, knowing he'd hear the distress in her voice where the others and even Mikhail wouldn't. She'd talk to him later. She looked back up at him. He was still looking down at her like she'd instigated this whole mess. She sighed, stretching to her tip toes and kissed his cheek. She tried not to cringe when she felt the muscle in his jaws clench and she could hear his teeth grind together. She didn't linger the way she usually would, she just sank back onto her feet and nodded to him, dipping her head. Her mother was rolling her grave if she watching her act like this but for the life of her she couldn't bring herself to rant and rave like she wanted to. It hurt too much to try and access that anger. \"Whatever you want, Sphinx. Whatever will make you happy.\" After what seemed like an eternity, Chaosia turned away from him and started back into the building. She didn't know why her eyes stung and why her heart felt so damned heavy. She'd known this fact for herself the second she'd set eyes on him, covered in coffee and her crumb cake. Just like she knew that telling him she loved him (at any stage) would probably not be returned. She just didn't know why it hurt so damned much to hear him say it. But in the back of her mind, as she smiled brightly for Sway and Atley taking a seat between them, a little voice whispered. Because he can say that but he won't say anything else . . . Sphinx was livid. It had been such a good day until Atley had opened his mouth. Causing him to open his mouth. And for the rest of the day, he'd been snubbed. Chaosia had stayed near her brother and Sway the rest of the time she'd been there. She'd laughed and joked but he could see it in her eyes. She wasn't as happy as she pretending to be. She was far from it actually. And for the life of him, he couldn't understand why it was like a kick in the gut every time he saw her let the façade drop. He hadn't said anything that wasn't true or unwarranted . . . he'd just told her what he thought . . . then why did seeing her like that make him want to drop to his knees if it make her happy? He'd grumbled, leaning against his wall as she and Sway toasted with their beers. That fact that this little voice in the back of his head kept calling him a liar and contradicting every reason he had for not even considering that he might have overreacted made him even surlier. He wasn't doing anything he didn't absolutely want to do. He'd lived that life before and he'd be damned if he'd do it again. Even for Chaosia. Finally after almost six hours of not even sparing him a passing glance as he stewed and brooded, she announced she was leaving. She'd gathered her keys, telling Junie to disperse the left overs accordingly before hugging and congratulating Memphis on his good luck. She'd waved and smiled at all of them, stopping by Atley long enough to nod before going towards her car. Sphinx walked out behind her, watching as her shoulders dropped more with each step. She opened the door and before he realized it he was catching her before she was in her car. She'd turned and sighed, stretching up to kiss his cheek again. But it wasn't like all of her other kisses. Her normal kisses left trails of fire in their wake . . . this one seemed to be near drowned in tears. Tears he hadn't even noticed she been shedding until she kissed him. \"I love you and I'll see you tomorrow. Go spend some time with your friends.\" And with that, she'd gotten in her Chevelle and drove away. Which is how he ended up looking out at the fading dirt trail her subdued driving had kicked up. When did she start to look so broken ? Lord, what had he done? Chaosia had never cried. Ever. Sure, she'd shed a few tears when her head had hurt and when she'd been upset over the ticket. But he could see the anger and frustration tingeing those tears. And today all he could see was pain and heartbreak. He'd made her cry. Because he'd said something stupid and (the more he'd thought about it throughout the night and started to listen to that little voice) enormously untrue. And the worst part was, he didn't know how to fix it. He couldn't just waltz into her home and apologize like he had that night forever ago when he'd thought he'd hurt her feelings over the damned football game. He was suddenly angry with himself. He didn't want to get married or to be tied down but he didn't want to lose her either. Chaosia had been in his life such a short amount of time but he was hard pressed to remember a time he was happier without her. And this is how he repaid her for her kind smiles and kisses and crazy antics that never (amazingly) made him want to separate from her. He'd hurt her and all he could do was wait until she'd speak to him again. If she ever did. It's sad and weird and the rest makes up for it I swear. I need my head examined. On to the next chapter . . .[Chapter 22] Inferno, please do not kill me for the fight scene in this chapter. I swear it serves a purpose. Decisions and Discoveries Chaosia sat in the parking lot at one of the many beach accesses, head resting on the steering wheel as she fought the tears that were tracing defiant rivers down her cheeks. She had almost gone to her mother and father's old home and let herself in. She still had a key and the house would've been empty but the thought of having to walk in that house and not have her mother there to sooth her had just made her heart hurt even more. She truly missed her mother's infinite wisdom everyday but today . . . this week the absence was even more pronounced. Her mother would've known exactly what to say to make her realize how stupid she was being or how childish. And would've made it okay to be sitting in the car crying her eyes out like an idiot. She shook her head, clearing her thoughts. She couldn't go down that road or she'd never come back up it. She'd locked all of that away two years ago and she wasn't letting it out because the person she wanted more than anything didn't want her in the same way. She sighed, getting out of the car, leaving her shoes and purse and only taking the phone and the keys. She crossed the deck board bridge to make her way towards the surf. Finally, when she was close enough to see the waves without getting soaked, she dropped into the sand pulling her knees up to rest her chin on. She stared out at the water for what seemed like forever, refusing to think on anything but the waves and the stars. Her phone broke her reverie and she glanced at it. Shocked, she did a double take. Not only was it now well past midnight (which meant she'd been at the beach for over three hours) but it was Selene calling. She sighed and answered the phone, preparing for another onslaught. Might as well let them kick her when she was down. \"Hello?\" \" Chaosia? Are you okay? You're father tried to call you back and your brother called him, saying you were upset when you left . . .\" Chaosia sniffed, amazed that Mikhail had picked up on it. Normally, something like this would've escaped his notice. Maybe her big brother was actually growing up. \"I'm fine. Sphinx and I had a misunderstanding and-\" \" Yes honey, Mikhail told us about that. Apparently he and one of his friends asked what was going on and the girl Swung?\" Chaos chuckled. \"Sway, Selene.\" \"Yes well, Sway overheard the two of you. Honestly, you need to tell him to get over himself, dearie. He might be attractive and have all of that Bad Boy crap going for him but . . . good, respectable girls like you don't want to marry people like him very often. Jesus, he should be thankful for it not scornful.\" Chaos sat in the sand, cold and shocked by what had come from her stepmother's mouth. Had she just? \"Uh, Selene . . . you do realize that I'm not . . . right? And I don't want to marry him. Not now anyway. I don't think. God I don't know what I think. Why did you call anyway?\" She could hear Selene dismissing her as she laughed. \" Because your father would only make you madder. I can see him fighting between taking up for you and that boy. He likes Sphinx, Chaos. Enough that hearing he said he wouldn't marry you has upset him greatly. So, if you're in trouble you're to come to-\" \"In trouble?\" She squeaked, she couldn't help it. \"What kind of trouble?\" Selene gave a long suffering sigh. \"Are you pregnant?\" Chaosia dropped the phone as she screamed, scrambling to catch it before it hit the now closer tide. \" NO! I'm not . . . I jus t had a . . . . If I even was it'd be too early to . . . JESUS SELENE! You watch too many damned soap operas.\" Selene laughed, long and hard. \"Then what's to worry about? You haven't been together long enough to start with wedding bells, love. Just enjoy being young. Everything else has this grand habit of working itself out.\" Chaosia sat there, stunned. Not only by the advice, which was surprisingly good to be coming from Selene, but at the compassion she could hear in her stepmother's voice. It only made her suspicious. \"You're not really a blood sucking harpy are you? You're actually a person under all of the gusto and bravada.\" \" That's our little secret Chaosia. A woman has to have her mystery, to keep her mystique. If she doesn't she's just a housewife. Listen, I'm going to go calm your father before he drains the second bottle of scotch. Just . . . work it out. And if it won't work out and you can't compromise then cut your losses and be done with it. No man is worth sacrificing your happiness, Chaosia. Because when they're long gone, all you have is yourself and whatever happiness you can bring. Now. I love you and I'm going to go and keep your father from the emergency room. Lord knows all this family needs is another alcoholic episode. Goodnight .\" And with that, the line went dead. Leaving Chaosia very confused and with a growing need to do exactly what her father was doing. God, she needed a drink . And she knew just where to go to get it. Paul stroked her back, shushing her as she sobbed into his shirt. She hadn't gone home, even with the lure of her hidden stash in the pantry. She couldn't. Not knowing that he was just upstairs and would either A) ignore her to sulk and brood over the fight he and Mikhail were sure to have gotten into or B) come down here to talk or whatever. And she couldn't handle either right now . . . because she honestly didn't know which would be worse . . . So she'd gone to the one person in the world who always knew how to fix her. Even when she didn't realize she was broken. She'd gone to Paul. Which is how she ended up on the balcony of his apartment on campus, bawling into his sweatshirt as he rubbed her back and ran his fingers through her hair. She'd poured her heart out to him and the tears had broken through and refused to stop. She'd told him about the intern and the way Sphinx had been acting all week and how he had reacted to Sway's ring and the rebuttal of any possible marriage at any point. And about her mother and her father and Selene's surprising display of humanity. And he'd mixed margaritas and held her, listening and drinking with her as she literally drowned in her tears and his tequila. He kept murmuring to her that everything would be okay but she honestly couldn't see how. She hadn't deluded herself into thinking that white picket fences and the 2.5 kids would be possible with the person she was so head over heels for . . . but hearing it out loud hurt. Bad. She leaned up, snubbing as Paul forced another margarita into her hand. She drained half the glass, sniffling. She was vaguely aware that she was at that crying drunk stage now and that he was at the slurring agreeing drunken stage. God, they were two peas in a pod. \"I know it's stupid, Paulie but I can't help it. I mean . . . what's so wrong with marrying me? Huh?\" Paul sighed, taking the glass from her and draining the rest before pouring another full glass from the blender on the outdoor coffee table. Chaos cocked her head to the side, looking at the blender. When had he brought the blender outside? \"Chaos, baby. I have no clue what goes on in that man's head but if I was straight you'd be wifey material. And no other would do.\" Chaos smiled, sniffling as she took the glass. \"Thanks Paulie. That makes me feel so much better.\" Paul nodded, pulling her into him and resting his cheek on her head as she leaned on his shoulder. They passed the huge glass between them until they'd drunk most of it. Paul always knew when she needed a shoulder to cry on or a booze hound to binge with. And tonight she was getting both. He shrugged as he took the last sip, placing the empty glass on the table. \"I'm glad it does, Chaos. I guess for now you'll just have to do with being my fag hag. But look at this way, you'll always look marvelous.\" Chaos laughed, more than a little tipsy after the however many blenders of margaritas they'd consumed in the past four hours. She sighed, sitting up and stretching as Paul went to get her something to sleep in. It was now well after midnight and she was exhausted. She'd been cooking for almost three days straight and submitting finals for portfolios and dealing with asshole teachers and now this? All she wanted was a cold, dark room and a bed . Hell, at this point even the bed was optional . Paul came back, handing her a pair of his grey sweats and a black wife beater with matching socks. God bless his heart. He could remember her feet got cold at night. She accepted the clothes, standing and going to change. Paul stopped her, pulling her into a hug. \"You gonna be okay, Calamity ?\" She nodded. \"Nothing a bottle of Jack and a straight razor can't fix, Hickok .\" He snorted, pushing her towards his bathroom. He hated it when she said that but it was the truth. Sort of anyway. Besides, he'd started it calling her Calamity. She smiled, shedding the dress and donning the borrowed lounge clothes as quickly as she could without falling. He hadn't called her that since she'd showed him her gun and tried to teach him to use it. Hence the nickname. Calamity Jane she might be but Paul was definitely no Bill Hickok with any gun. She giggled, remembering the way he'd fallen flat on his back when he'd fired the gun at the range. She'd been so busy laughing she hadn't realized he'd knocked himself silly with the damned thing until much later. She sighed. Those were the days. Neither of them had been attached or trying to stay attached to anyone other than themselves and each other. She'd been recovering form heartbreak and Paul from the separation from his weird and hateful family. But for the life of her, Chaos couldn't imagine going back to life without her burly and brooding beau. Even if he didn't want to marry her. She emerged from the bathroom and went to Paul's bedroom, flopping down on the bed as he crawled in the other side. She sighed, scrunching up next to him and flipping on the TV on the chest of drawers. As Forensic Files came on, she wailed and he groaned, flipping it to Adult Swim before they got caught in the case file. As the Drinky Crow show came on, Chaos had to wonder what Sphinx was doing. And if he even cared what she was doing. Sphinx held the bag of frozen peas to his cheek, glaring at Mikhail who was mimicking the motion with a bag of frozen corn. They were currently on opposite benches at Otto's and in 'time out', courtesy of Junie and Sway. Memphis was standing back with Atley, both keeping a weather eye on the two of them. He snorted, shifting the bag to cover the ever expanding bruise blossoming on his cheek. Memphis shook his head, watching as they continued to glare at one another and rip blood everywhere. Say what you wanted to about Mikhail but the boy didn't believe in a no win scenario. When Sway has asked him why Chaos was so sad and mentioned that she might have overheard an argument between them, he'd gone straight to Sphinx. Who had refused to say anything at all and had turned from the younger boost. Mikhail, however was not to be deterred and had persisted. Which led to the Sphinx snapping and shouting: \"It's none of your bloody business boy. So stay out of it.\" Which had been the catalyst to one of the best fights Memphis Raines had ever seen in his life. Where Sphinx was bigger and definitely mean enough to hurt or injure, Mikhail was fast and had this amazing hook. As a matter of fact, it had sounded like a damn gunshot when his fist connected with Sphinx's jaw. Sphinx however was not one to be taken down in one hit and had practically lifted the boy above his head, tossing him into over one of the picnic tables. Mikhail had been back up and on his feet, diving at Sphinx again before anyone could stop him. It had only been Junie stepping between them that had stopped the flurry of punches and curses. Now they were seemingly content to glare at one another with bags of frozen produce held to their bruising faces. And Memphis was making a mental note to never tangle with either of them. Period. Atley shifted beside him, causing Sphinx to look over at them. Atley however, just leveled the infamous Jackson glare on both men. \"I can't believe you two idiots did this at Thanksgiving. I for one am glad you won't be here for Christmas Sphinx. Let London deal with this mess.\" Mikhail glared darkly at Atley and Memphis was suddenly reminded of his younger sister. When they were angry the family resemblance was striking. And terrifying. \"He isn't going to London. Or anywhere else near my sister for that matter. I'll chop him to bits if he even thinks about it.\" Sphinx growled, glare darkening as he turned on Mikhail. \"I'll do as I please boy. And if she wants me to go then I'll bloody go.\" \"Why?\" Mikhail asked, frost falling from the words as they left his mouth. His voice had dropped instead of rising. And Memphis knew from their budding friendship that that was never a good sign. Mikhail was about to snap. Bad. \"You don't want to even think about marrying her but you'll fly half way around the world to meet her family and rub shoulders with her friends there? You really are a cruel bastard if you do it, Sphinx.\" Sphinx stood, glowering down at the boy as he jumped to his feet, meeting the man halfway to glare up at him. Their shoes were almost touching as they started to argue. Memphis shook his head while Atley looked torn between laughter and horror. Donnie stepped up, putting an arm between them. He was taller and heavier than both so he could (hopefully) easily move them if he had to. Jesus this was getting ridiculous. \"Whether or not I want to marry her is between us you nosy little git. It's our business. Not yours or anyone else's. So piss off .\" \"Yeah, because the fact that I can see how much she adores you and how bad hearing you say that hurt her is supposed to sit well with me. Think again. I'm not going to let you or anyone else hurt her Sphinx. Not like that. Not again. She's already had one asshole string her along and do this shit to her and I'll be damned if I'm going to watch it happen again when I can stop it.\" He stepped back, spitting on the ground at Sphinx's feet before turning to go sit back down. \"Besides, if you even remotely cared about Chaosia you wouldn't do this shit to her. I mean, what kind of heartless bastard tells their girlfriend that he never wants to marry her then just expects her to stick around.\" Memphis watched Sphinx's normally impassive face transform into an expression of deep thought. As Junie and Otto came out with the first aid kits, he looked to Mikhail. \"What do you mean she's already had someone else do this to her?\" Mikhail sat back, looking at Sphinx confused. \"She didn't tell you?\" Shpinx shook his head as the others watched an understanding blossom across Mikhail's face before it soured. \"Oh Chaos I am going to kick your ass. She promised she would bring it up if things between you two got really serious.\" He sighed and put his head in his hands, wincing as he touched one of his many new cuts and bruises. Memphis stepped up, asking what the others obviously wanted to know. \"What was she supposed to tell him, 'Khail?\" \"She was engaged before when she was younger. She was barely twenty one and they'd known each other forever. To make a really long and drawn out story short, Chaos caught him in bed with the girlfriend of a friend two weeks before they were supposed to get married. She didn't really date seriously after that. I mean, sure she'd have boyfriends and all that but she never really let them in. That's why I was so worried when Sway mentioned she was seeing someone. I always worried she'd go back to him or find . . .\" He looked up at Sphinx, suddenly somber. \"You're still an ass for saying that to my sister on principal alone but knowing that you didn't know just makes it a mistake. A huge fucking mistake but a mistake. But I swear Sphinx, if you care about her at all, then you'd better reevaluate the way you want your relationship to be. And end. Chaos may not say it, but she does want to get married. Eventually. And if you make her give that up then you really are heartless.\" Sphinx nodded, sinking back into the bench as Otto came over to stitch the cut over his eye. Otto slapped his shoulder, bringing his and Memphis's attention away from the now whining Mikhail as Junie poured peroxide on his face. Otto smirked at him, swabbing the cut. \"You'll figure it out. If it helps, I never wanted to get hitched either. Even after I met Junie. Then, when we found out she was pregnant with my son . . . it just seemed to all fall in place, you know? Now I wake up and wonder why in the world I was ever so stupid. I could've had six more years to enjoy with her.\" Sphinx shocked them by saying, \"You regret it? Not acting sooner? But it'll eat you alive.\" Otto chuckled. Nodding. \"You're right, it will. But the best way to keep from having regrets Sphinx is to live your life. You may make mistakes but . . . the point of that is to learn.\" He winked, looking over at Junie who was fussing over Mikhail while Sway laughed. Memphis felt his own face pull into a grin as Sway reached down and pressed on a particularly dark bruise. Hard. \"Besides, it's not like you have to marry Sway. Raines gets that horror-I mean honor.\" Memphis laughed as Sphinx turned to watch the others. He could tell by looking at him that his friend was deep in thought. And trying to make heads-or-tails of the shit storm he'd landed himself in. Who'd have ever thought that the man who didn't speak could let his mouth get him so much trouble? I know I know drama drama drama. Next Chapter . . .[Chapter 23] And here is the last part of the three chapter update. Yay! A Little Less Conversation Sphinx paced the apartment, dialing her number for the seventh time that morning. She still wasn't answering. And not just him. Mikhail had called ( to his surprise) and wanted him to wake her up because they were supposed to meet for breakfast hours ago. And she hadn't shown up. And regardless of what he did, he couldn't shake the feeling that something awful had happened to her. What if she'd wrecked on her way from the garage? Or she'd been mugged or something else had happened. Atley and Memphis were on their way and Mikhail was already inbound with the spare key to her apartment handy in case she was home and not answering. Lord let her be home and pitching a fit. Don't let anything have happened to her. A knock on the door brought him to it, pulling it open to see all three other boosts outside his home. Mikhail shot straight through to his patio, bruises and bandages shining brightly against his skin as he opened the doors and descended the fire escape in a rush. Memphis and Atley followed, both waiting for Sphinx to bring up the rear. They lot of them had talked and sorted the majority of their issues the night before, though Mikhail still seemed to want to pitch him into the surf. Which would be fine by him after he made sure Chaosia was okay. Besides, he needed to hang back anyway. If Chaos was just mad, her seeing him first might not be a good thing. Hell, after his stunt last night she might not answer the door period. And with the brother he'd abused leading the way . . .He shook his head. Best not dwell on what would happen when Chaos found out he and Mikhail had been fighting. Atley had been the one to point out that Meghanne's behavior (not to mention his own) and his over crass dismal of all things matrimony might go hand-in-hand for Chaosia. Especially in light of what they'd learned from her brother after their brawl. And he hadn't even considered it when he'd been so brutal with her. He'd just said what had been on his brain and hadn't thought of how it could be taken. God this is why he didn't fucking talk! It just got him into trouble when he did! Mikhail opened the door and they made their way inside. Nothing was out of place and her bed hadn't been slept in. She hadn't come home last night. Sphinx felt something cold settle at the pit of his stomach. This wasn't good. This wasn't good at all. Chaosia rolled over, vaguely aware of the sunlight and the fact that she wasn't in her own home. She could hear Paul singing in the shower so that told her where she was but why had she? Oh. She closed her eyes, sitting up. She remembered. Paul emerged from the bathroom, towel draped around his waist as he handed her a pair of jeans and tee shirt. \"You left flip flops over here before and thank God we're close to the same size. We'll cuff the pants and I'll sacrifice a belt until I get you home. Let me get dressed and we can head out okay?\" She nodded, taking the clothes and changing as he disappeared back into the steamy bathroom. The plain heather blue tee shirt would be okay with the faded and distressed jeans. She slid them on, cuffing them twice to her calves before putting the cardigan from last night on over the tee shirt. She shook her hair loose and dug around in her bag until she found her glasses. Paul remerged from the bathroom wearing a black tee and tight jeans, his blond hair styled to perfection. He grabbed a track jacket from the closet as Chaos shook her head, glad they'd stayed with tequila last night and not gin. She grabbed her purse, Paul telling her to leave the dress and heels until another time as they headed towards the door. They were going to grab some food from Sonic then they were going to her apartment. And they were going to clean the damn thing until she felt better. Atley and Memphis watched Mikhail and Sphinx pace the girl's apartment. They were going to dig a rut into her hardwood floors if they didn't sit down. Memphis sighed. Sway had confided in him exactly what she overheard Sphinx and Chaosia about arguing last night and he could honestly understand the girl not wanting to be around any of them. She probably went to stay with one of her friends and think. He sighed, taking a long drink of the beer Atley had brought him from Chaosia's fridge. The girl had every right to be pissed at Sphinx. And now knowing what Mikhail had told them . . . Hell, Sway would've killed him for even thinking of pulling a stunt like that. You don't fuck with woman and marriage or children. Those two things were their ballgame and they got to have the final say. Because honestly both things were more about the women involved than the men. Oh sure the guy had responsibilities as far as wedding shit goes and was definitely supposed to be an active and supportive father (if they were worth anything) but the women had to plan it and bear the brunt of the labor. In both cases. Which is why when Sway said after they got married that she wanted to try to have kids he'd agreed. If she was ready for that stuff then he could be too. He just wished Sphinx would see that no matter how un ready he thought he was that loosing Chaos to something as trivial as whether or not to get married eventually was stupid. And he knew his longtime friend was anything but. Besides, they hadn't been together long enough to worry about that. Hell, he and Sway had been together (off and on mind you) over twelve years. And while Sphinx wasn't getting any younger, he couldn't see the man just jumping into matrimony just because. If anything, he'd run from it. Like he was now. All heads turned as a key hit the patio door lock and Memphis was suddenly aware he was holding his breath. When Chaosia's friend Paul walked in, sonic bags in hand, he let out a sigh. He'd been right. She was fine. And laughing if the cackles from behind the pouting boy were anything to go by. Paul hadn't noticed them as he turned and glared at Chaosia, who was flushed and giggling. And dressed in the man's clothes, apparently. Oh, this was going to be interesting. \"I still don't think it's fair, Calamity , that you are such a damn good shot while I get my dick knocked in the dirt. I mean seriously you weigh one fifty soaking wet and you handle a Desert Eagle better than a guy?\" She laughed, shrugging as she closed the door. She'd told Paul what had her laughing and now he was pouting. Oh well. He was too damned funny not to aggravate. \"It's not my fault I was taught to use it by a professional , Hickok. If you ever go to London with me though I'll be sure to introduce you. You and Errol would have a lot in common.\" She turned, stopping dead in her tracks at the four sets of eyes on her and Paul. Atley and Memphis were spread out on her couch watching them like they had front row seats at a show while Mikhail was glaring at her hard enough to make her skin burn. Sphinx however is who had her skin crawling. His glare could've peeled the skin from bones. And why did both of them look like they'd gone a few rounds with a rabid gorilla? Sphinx wasn't glaring at her but at her clothes. Or Paul's clothes as the case was. And if he could he would be setting them on fire with his eyeballs. She blushed but straightened. She'd be damned before she'd feel bad about borrowing from Paul. She'd done it a million times before. And with the way he was acting, it seemed like she'd be doing it a million times after him too. \"What?\" Mikhail opened his mouth only to be cut off by a furious Sphinx. He paced around her counter coming to stand directly in front of her, glaring down at her as she glared up at him. \"And where in the bloody hell have you been?! Are you so daft you can't pick up the fucking blow and tell someone you're in one piece?!\" Chaos stared at him, honestly shocked that he was speaking, much less yelling in front of the others. She knew he carried on small conversations with them privately but to do this? And after the way he'd reacted to his misconception last night . . . If he wanted to play this game, they'd play. She shrugged, moving around him to sit her things on the kitchen counter and kick her flip flops off at the patio door. If she kept her cool, she would be fine. If he pushed her she just might break. And she couldn't be held responsible for the aftermath. But try as she might she couldn't keep the words from escaping her lips. \"What does it matter to you? Afraid I'd run off to the alter with some other big emotionally retarded oaf?\" He darkened neither paying attention to their now rapt audience. It occurred to Chaosia that this would be the first time anyone had really seen them fight. Not squabble or nitpick but truly knock down drag out fight. She pushed it aside and watched him as he retorted. \"If I was it'd be justified. Apparently it wouldn't be the first time either. Tell me Chaosia, just when did you plan on telling you'd been engaged and almost bloody married ? Jesus. I gave up my peace and quiet for this shite?\" Chaos froze like she'd been hit and she saw the instant remorse flicker through Sphinx's face the second the words passed through his lips. But she didn't care that he was sorry. Not right now. All she could see was her own hurt and rage at his attitude and behavior. She stood there, silently looking at him as the others watched. She could feel Mikhail's unease behind her and the tension from Atley and Memphis. But as she watched him continue to stare at her, remorseful or not, the hard won survival instincts that two years of dealing with Selene and Jacqueline overrode any and all sympathy for her lover. He had hurt her and he looked sorry . She was about to make him sorrier. She straightened again, tossing her hair over her shoulder as she leveled her darkest glare at him. Darker than the one she'd given Meghanne. \"If you want your piece so badly then go get it from the airhead chasing you around work because I'm done . I didn't ask you to get married, Sphinx. I hadn't even thought about it until I saw Sway's ring. And you know what? I knew then that it wasn't ever going to happen. And as for the other it was a long time ago and quite frankly it isn't any of your damned business. And I was almost okay with it until you said it out loud .\" He stopped looking at her shocked as Mikhail edged away from her and over to Memphis. At least he was smart enough to recognize the coming meltdown when he saw one. \"But it's not okay now. I do want to get married. I do want kids and I would love for all of that happy horse shit to have been with you. One day in the very distant future. But now that I know it isn't going to be . . . because you don't ever want it. So I'm sorry. I love you, Sphinx. I really do. But I am not going to deal with this when I'd be sacrificing so much and all you can think of is you .\" She turned, going to the counter to lean. She needed some sort of support or her knees were going to give way. She hated this. She hated feeling like this but it was the only way. If she didn't do this now she never would. And she'd be heartbroken and alone eventually anyway. Selene was right. She had to ensure her own happiness and it was apparent that he wasn't going to be a part of it. Better to do it quick like after all. \"I'm not asking you to change. I never have. But I hoped that you would want this one day like I did. For yourself . But since you don't then I won't shackle you to it. You know I want it, one day and it'll drive us apart eventually. So I'm cutting you lose. I love you enough to do that.\" Sphinx felt the world shift. He'd fucked this up proper and he couldn't seem to think fast enough to fix it. How had they gotten o this point? He'd been so worried about her and then she just pooped in. And dressed like that. Jesus, why did he say anything at all? He should've let her blow off her steam and talked about this rationally. Just the two of them. But oh no . His fucking pride got the better of him after seeing her in another man's clothes (one he knew was in no way a possibility for Chaos but still) and now it seemed like it would land him alone. Again. The funny thing was, he'd been alone. And he didn't want to be that again. He wanted to be with Chaosia, in any way he could. And if that meant buying a ring and a house and having snot-nosed brats then by God she'd have it. He might hate every minute of it but if it made her happy then so be it. He wanted her. He closed the gap between them, pulling her as tightly into him as he could before crushing his mouth against hers. One hand held the back of her head while the other kept a firm grip on her hip. She groaned and leaned into him as she wrapped her arms around his neck, returning the kiss. She melted against him just like she always did, just like she was made for him and him alone. He didn't want to give this up. She pulled back, eyes watering and went to open her mouth to yell at him again probably and he cut her off, swallowing her protests as he slanted his lips against hers again in a bruising kiss. When she pulled back again, he was vaguely aware of their audience and the look on Memphis's face. Lord Raines was about to faint. He dipped his head, holding hers to his by cupping her cheeks as he pressed his forehead against hers. It didn't escape him that his hands almost covered her entire face as he held her to him or that she was so tiny in comparison. He had always marveled at how delicate she was but to see her like this, eyes leaking and cheeks flushed from trying not to cry and being so damned mad . . . he suddenly realized how fragile she was. How precious. And how close he'd come to irrevocably destroying whatever it was she held for him. He had to fix this. Now. \"I love you.\" She looked up at him, eyes wide before closing them and trying to turn her face from his hands. He held her and wouldn't let her as he leaned in again, rubbing his cheek against the small exposed portion of hers. Her tears were falling freely now and he couldn't fight the fact that each one burned like acid when it hit his skin. \"I love you, Chaosia. I honestly and truthfully do. And I apologize for being . . .\" He stopped, fumbling over the words as she looked at him. God why was this so hard? He'd apologized before and it hadn't been this hard. \"I apologize for overreacting and being such a wanker . I just . . . it took me off guard, Love.\" \"Why?\" She asked him in a tiny whisper as he brushed the tears from her cheeks. Atley and Memphis got up, scuttling out the patio door, Paul dragging Mikhail in his wake to give them the privacy they needed. As soon as the door closed and they were alone he answered her, kissing her lightly on the cheek. \"Why wouldn't it? I'm so much older than you and you want to get-\" She cut him off, shaking her head in his hands. \"But I didn't want to get married, Sphinx. At least not right now. I have school to finish and things to do and I just wanted to enjoy myself, my time with you. I know I want you for as long as you want me but I swear I hadn't even considered it until Sway showed me the ring. And even then it was a passing thought!\" He kissed her. \"I know, Love. I believe you. I just for the life of me couldn't understand why you'd want to marry me period. Don't you see you'd be wasting your life? I'd be old and grey when you're just starting to enjoy life and-\" She cut him off again, rising to her tips toes to kiss him. Thoroughly. The intensity behind her kiss took his breath away. She'd never in all of their time together kissed him like she was right this second. And he knew that any kiss he'd ever receive after it would pale in comparison. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her flush against him as he returned her kiss full heartedly. She moaned, pulling away a few seconds later. \"I love you but I'm serious. We have to settle this, Sphinx. I do not think that spending whatever time you'll give me is wasting it. And if it's the rest of my life then I would be thrilled. I promise I won't wake up one morning lamenting all of the things I should've or could've done with my life. I don't do regrets, Sphinx. Life's too short to piss and moan about all of the things that could've been.\" He nodded, rubbing his cheek against hers again. This was the second time in as many days that he'd been told to no regret living his life. Maybe that was a sign. \"No regrets then?\" She shook her head. \" No regrets . If you feel trapped or uncomfortable then tell me. That was our deal , remember?\" He sighed, holding her to him. He remembered her telling him numerous times to say or do something when he was uncomfortable with a turn their fast paced romance was taking. She made him swear to do so. And he was apparently going to have to live up to that promise. \"When in the world did you grow up so damned fast? Are you sure you're not my age?\" She shrugged, kissing his cheek as she held him. \"I've always been old , Sphinx. But I get to enjoy being myself with you. I can act my age and how I feel without having to balance the two like I do for everyone else. Even Mikhail and my Dad. That's one of the million little things I love about you.\" He smirked cockily, happy that her voice had a joking edge to it. Joking meant she was at least considering forgiving him and not leaving his sorry ass. \" Just a million then?\" She rolled her eyes before her expression turned somber. She looked back up at him and sighed. \"Look . . . I'm not saying I'm going to forget it but . . . let's just try and move past all of this okay?\" Sphinx felt his gut drop back into place. He hadn't even been aware that it had moved. She was going to forgive him. Dear God, she was going to forgive him for being an idiot. He dipped his lips to hers quickly, kissing her again before letting her continue. She blushed and looked down as he said, \"I love you, Chaosia.\" She nodded, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt as she suddenly refused to look up at him. \"Yeah. I love you too . . . and I really do want to be with you but . . . I-we need to get some things straight eventually. But for now . . . let's just-\" He cut her off, pulling her to his chest. His mouth and hands were everywhere as he scooped her up and carried her to her bedroom. He didn't care about the four people waiting on them in the apartment upstairs or the bitching that was sure to happen. All he cared about at this moment was assuaging him in her. With her. She hadn't left or abandoned him even when he deserved it. That was a first for anyone outside of his tight knit crew. Chaosia pulled away, holding his face in her hands looking to keep his assault from continuing. \"I love you, Sphinx.\" He nodded, pushing past her hands and starting again, lavishing her neck and jaw with tiny bites and kisses. \"I know, Love. I love you too. But bloody hell you talk too much.\" She smacked his shoulder, noticing his wince and made him sit up. \"So. What happened to you and my brother?\" He gulped, knowing that she was going to kill him for the harm he'd delivered upon her family. Now he just had to find a way to tell her that didn't involve dissolving her good graces. \"Random bar room brawl?\" She gave him a deadpan look. \"More like random garage room brawl. Right? I don't want to know. Just swear no more fighting.\" He nodded, dipping his head to kiss her neck again, this time leaning her back and onto the bed slowly. She sighed, shaking her head, and swatting him, this time on the other shoulder. \"No way Buster. I am still upset with you and we have guests upstairs in your apartment. Don't you think it would be a little rude to-\" He cut her off with a finger to her lips. \"They're big boys Chaosia. Besides . . . I want to apologize properly. Will you let me? Please?\" She rolled her eyes, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and leaned up to kiss his bruised and abused cheek. \"Fine. You'd better be glad I love you.\" He nodded dipping his head to rest his cheek over her heart and enjoyed the rare occasion of holding her and being held back. He usually wouldn't let her do this. But today . . . Today was a day of new beginnings and by God he was going to enjoy every part of being with her. Especially since, judging by the way she was threading her fingers through his hair, she seemed to enjoy the rare moment as much as he did. \"I am sorry.\" \"I know, baby. I am too. For not telling you about . . . I just. I didn't want it to hang over this you know?\" He nodded against her chest looking up to kiss the tip of her nose. \"I understand it, Love. Believe me. I understand it.\" She nodded, smiling at him before kissing him. \"So . . . I keep hearing about this grand apology . . . and-\" He cut her off, not giving her another opportunity to do anything but enjoy his newfound conscience. And he made sure she was going to enjoy every second of it. Atley watched the other three men peruse Sphinx's apartment, seeing as in none of them had actually been in it before. He sat back on the sofa, drinking one of Sphinx's beers and flipped through the channels on the TV. Paul quickly lost interest after seeing the bedroom, shaking his head and muttering as he sat on the other side of the sofa. \"No wonder the hussy never has time for me anymore. Probably hates leaving that huge bed.\" Mikhail glared at him as he came back in the living room from Sphinx's office while Atley and Memphis laughed. \"Dude I do not even want to think about that, okay? She is my sister.\" Paul, seeing something to torture, smiled evilly as he leaned back and crossed his arms. \"Hate to burst your bubble but what do you think is probably going on right now, Mikhail? Especially is she accepted the apology he was sure to give her after we left.\" Memphis and Atley watched as all of the color drained from Mikhail's face, making the bruises from before seem even darker. Paul chuckled and nodded, winking to the other two. \"Yep. Right about now he's probably using that wicked tongue of his for the greater good and-\" \"JESUS PAUL! Shut UP! I don't want to know. And how the hell would you know anyway?! Wait don't tell me. I am happy in the dark! I swear.\" Memphis shook his head while Atley looked at Paul in a new light. Chaosia apparently shared most things with the diva on the opposite side of the couch. This was a good opportunity to learn. And to help. Though his last attempt had been a crash-and-burn, the next one could be better. \"So she actually talks to you about it? She's almost as closed lipped around us as he is when it comes to their relationship.\" Paul nodded, examining his nails before buffing them on his shirt. \"Yeppers peppers. Why? What do you want to know?\" Atley and Memphis shared a look while Mikhail groaned and dropped his head on the kitchen counter. They'd just made a new best friend in their crusade to help Sphinx keep his girlfriend. Sphinx wouldn't know what hit him. Yes yes the idiot are now going to try and help. Wonder how well that's going to pan out . . . Later.[Chapter 24] And here is chapter Twenty Four. Sphinx is trying really hard to make up for being an ass. Let's see how that goes. Small Steps Chaosia sat in the middle of the living room floor, the pieces for her photography project spread around her with highlighters and a white charcoal pencil to mark which ones she wanted. She looked up, pushing her glasses back up her nose into place and sighed, watching amazed as Sphinx walked around her trying to get things together for whatever he was doing. He already had cleaned both of their apartments while she'd been at Paul's and he was moving around her spot in the floor hurriedly, almost constantly in motion. Since their huge blow up three days prior Sphinx had been on his ultra-best behavior, almost waiting on her hand and foot. And she had no idea why. They'd talked a bit later the night she'd forgiven him and she'd told him plainly that she loved him for him, asshole tendencies and all. But she wasn't going to deal with all of the drama he'd managed to drudge up on Thanksgiving because he wouldn't talk to her before believing Atley or Memphis when they 'noticed' something. She'd also had a nice heart-to-heart with the male members of the crew (mainly Atley, Mikhail and Memphis) and asked them to keep their noses out of their relationship. While she appreciated the help, it was now very apparent that she wasn't like anything any of them had expected . . . even her brother. So whatever they thought they knew was probably false and just sure to start yet another war between her and her lover. Sphinx stopped long enough to dip down and kiss the top of her head before disappearing down the hall, leaving Chaosia shaking her head as she watched him. Lord what had gotten into him? Apparently when she'd told him to stop being such a drama queen about the whole wedding and marriage crap (and that if it was ever on her mind for real after his little stunt she'd be sure to let him know) he'd decided to start acting like . . . well the closest thing she had to compare it to was Memphis when he was trying to get back in Sway's good graces. And while that thought in itself was humorous, she was about to go crazy. First he placated her all week and was all kissy and then he blew up and now he was acting damned . . . chipper. She was beginning to worry that he was bipolar. Or had suffered a nervous breakdown. Junie, however, had been the one to suggest while she was complaining (yes complaining) about the sudden change that maybe Sphinx was just trying to change for her. And since he hadn't been in a long term relationship that any of them were aware of in the time they'd known him (which just proved to Chaos that he was private and not celibate like the others had chosen to believe before she came along) that maybe he was at odds on how to act with her. Especially after their fight. She sighed, hearing the water to the shower come on. She was beginning to believe that Junie may be right . . . but she was going to see if she could swing breakfast in bed one more time before sitting him down and explaining that all she really wanted was him to be himself . . . and just ask her before he went off the deep end. Or warn her so she could be out of the country when it happened. She smirked. Maybe she would ask for crepes and eggs tomorrow . . . He had been a royal prick and he did deserve some degree of torture for his extremely bad behavior. And while normally cutting off everything in the bedroom would be the course of action (hey, if you're pissed then you so don't want to even hear them breath let alone touch them to quote Sway) she enjoyed that particular detail of their budding romance far too much to deny herself. Besides . . . angry sex was great sex. And make up sex beat even that . And Sphinx was proving a master at both. She blushed; shaking her thoughts away from that as she heard the water cut off and him go down the hall into his bedroom. She sighed, standing and popping her back before making her way to the bedroom. It was time to see what her wayward and brooding boyfriend was up to. Sphinx kept glaring at the silk and wool blend charcoal tux lying out on his bed but he knew it was for a good cause. He had bought the damn tickets to the Gravedigger's Ball (the Coroner's Office annual end of the year banquet and dance) while Chaosia's father and stepmother had been stateside . . . and after their fight he decided that it would be good for them to go. It was being held at the Long Beach Museum of Art as a portion of their Macabre and Superstition Exhibit. He personally thought it was in bad taste for the Coroner's Office to host the damned fundraiser in the Superstition exhibit but the thing had been planned for around Halloween and then postponed because the traveling exhibition had stayed in Los Angeles a month over schedule. So now instead of the masquerade it had originally been intended to be it had transformed into an overly formal black tie affair. The extra tickets alone had been astronomical with the discount he received for being a damned pathologist . . . but it would do them both some good. Hopefully. He checked the clock. It was still only four and everything didn't start until well after eight so he had plenty of time to get ready . . . now all he had to do was keep Chaosia busy until Paul and Sway got to her apartment at five. Sway to help get her to agree (and bringing the dress she had insisted on picking out and putting on his credit card) and Paul for hair and make-up (which he would be absent for). He knew she would be angry with him for not saying anything but this was meant to be a surprise before he'd fucked up and now . . . Now she needed the night out. Her professor was demanding her final done by the time she was in his class next. Two weeks prior to anyone else's. And while Chaos wasn't saying he knew it was the same man who had given her such a hard time before. He sighed, drying off and donning his sweat pants and forgoing his shirt. She needed this. A night out and away. And if it got him closer to being truly forgiven then he'd do this every damn day until she told him to stop. The door opening caused him to turn and the sight of Chaosia made his breath catch. He hadn't really paid the way she was dressed much attention when she'd come over . . . he'd been too happy she'd come without much of a fight. She'd come to his apartment straight from the gym and practice . . . meaning she was still wearing those delicious little short shorts she trained in . . . and the tight white tank top that was barely stretched across her bosom. Her hair was up in a high curling ponytail and her glasses were on, sliding ever so slightly down her nose. He grinned, crossing the room to keep her from seeing the tux, pulling her into him and dipping his head to capture her lips in a long, slow kiss. Without warning, he scooped her up, holding her flush to him as her legs wrapped around his waist. He quickly made the trip down the hallway to his living room, ever mindful of dropping her or stepping on her project while he navigated his way to the couch. He'd just figured out a wonderful way to spend the next hour and keep her away from the damned tux. She was so nosy when she wanted to be . . . he was finding it difficult to keep this secret a secret. He deposited her on the couch, lowering himself on top of her after removing her shirt in one single fluid motion. He almost died. Under the tank top . . . . \"Please dear Lord, tell me you didn't wear this to practice . . .\" She was wearing this pale pink bra with white lace that came up and actually cupped the portion of her breasts trying to escape. He brushed his thumb over one side and groaned. Only she would wear silk and lace to damn soccer practice. She smiled up at him almost bashfully and shrugged, leaning up to kiss the corded muscles in his neck. He leaned his head to the side, allowing her to kiss all the way down to his clavicle and back up his collarbone to his shoulder, leaving a trail of slow fire in her wake. He closed his eyes, savoring the moment before her voice brought him back. \"If you like the bra then you'll love the panties.\" He didn't need any more invitation then that and within seconds he was staring down at something that had his mouth watering. The same pale pink silk with white lace trim on the edges . . . With what looked like a nice satin white ribbon threaded around the waist to add detail. She smiled at him, pushing him back to get up so he could see the back. Oh dear God the back. When she and Paul had gossiped on the phone the day before about the wonders of cheeky panties (and he had been trying not to listen so he wouldn't get the mental image of Paul in that underwear thank you very much) he had dismissed it as another 'girl talk' session. But now as he saw those wonders for himself . . . he was considering buying stock in the damned things. The low-rise silk panties were bad enough on their own but on the back, a small V rested right above the swell of Chaosia's derrière and was laced with the white ribbon from the front then knotted in a small perfect white bow at the tip of the V. The colors of the set contrasted sharply with her tanned skin as she looked back over her shoulder at him, blushing. \"Do you like it? I got it for London but I couldn't resist trying it on when I got back from practice . . . the suspense was killing me.\" Sphinx reached out, pulling her back into him and down onto his waiting lap. He rested his hands on her hips, though they were itching to slide down a bit further. He nodded, kissing her neck. \"I love it, Chaosia . . . and I love you. I'm so sorry about the other-\" She placed her fingers on his lips, silencing him before he could start. \"What's done is done, Big Boy. And while I appreciate all of this apologizing I'm getting we agreed to work on things and make sure that the other day doesn't happen again remember?\" He nodded, taking a moment to nip at the flesh on her neck lightly with his teeth. She giggled and swatted him, careful of his still sore shoulder from Mikhail. That boy packed a punch . No wonder no one in Eddie's crew ever messed with him. She straightened, lowering herself flush against him and rubbing her cheek against his. \"Then after you make me breakfast in bed tomorrow I'll consider us even. So long as you don't mess up again. Deal?\" He snorted, seeing where she was going with this. \"Am I to feed your Royal Highness too?\" She shrugged, looking up as though she were contemplating the possibility, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth. Sphinx counted the seconds she nibbled on the plump pink flesh until he finally had to liberate it for himself. When they parted, she shook her head, resting her forehead against his as her curls fell around their faces, forming a multicolored curtain of ringlets. \"I guess you just being there with me will be enough. This time. I expect breakfast in bed on every anniversary however.\" He smirked, kissing her nose. \"Oh really? And what do I get out of this deal?\" She beamed at him, obviously playing. This was a good sign. She wasn't sulking and threatening him under her breath so she was actually going to be okay. Maybe. \"Why Mr. Sphinx . . . you get me .\" He cupped her cheek, brushing his thumb against her lips as he nodded. \"Then that's a great deal, Love.\" She blushed again and he realized just how little she'd actually gotten from him before the other to have this make her blush darker than a tomato. He had a lot of making up to do. He leaned in, capturing her lips in his as he pulled her even closer to him. And he was going to start right now. Chaosia leaned back against Sphinx's chest, enjoying the feel of his hands working the shampoo in her hair as the steaming water beat down on both of them. The shower had been a good idea. Especially after their romp on the couch. She sighed. They hadn't taken a shower together since their first time and it was nice to actually be able to enjoy this level of . . . intimacy with him (with warning) . . . without either of them freaking out. Maybe he needed to put his foot in his mouth more often . . . she shook her head, causing him to look down at her before shrugging and pulling both of them directly under the spray. As she felt the soap and shampoo wash away she doubted her heart could handle another fight like the other one. And she hoped she wouldn't have to. Their little nitpicking was one thing but she knew now that both of their egos wouldn't allow for a peaceful resolution without intervention or time apart to cool down. It was only his brain kicking on that had saved them being together period. And for a second she'd thought about just slugging him and being done with it. But then he'd said the three words she'd been dying to hear again and she caved. She shivered as his hands brushed against her sides as he leaned down to kiss a trail from her hairline to her shoulder blade on her back. She hoped he never found out how much sway he actually had over her or she was a goner. Though if he kept kissing and rubbing like that then she doubted she would mind. She leaned back into him again, turning her head to kiss under his chin. She didn't always understand why but she loved the big oaf to death. They just needed to work on his holiday and social skills and house breaking him . . . As his hands slipped down her sides and found purchase on her hips, rational thought left her. Apparently their shower was about to get much longer. Sway and Paul shared a look as Chaosia glared at Sphinx. They'd come to his apartment to kidnap Chaosia as planned only to have to wait in the hall for a dripping Sphinx, clad only in his sweat pants and the towel slung around his shoulders, to open the door and let them in. Chaosia was dressed in one of his tee shirts and her soccer shorts and had this peculiar glow about her every time she looked up and saw Sphinx smirking down at her. Then the glow would be eaten by the ever growing blush that seemed to seep its way onto her cheeks and neck. Until Paul had announced she was coming with him whether she liked it or not and he wasn't taking no for an answer, springing the surprise element. And apparently he had been right. The surprise portion of the stoic boost's official apology to Chaos was not appreciated and she was livid. She kept glaring at him as Paul ushered her out of his apartment and down to her own. \"C'mon honey. You'll get to murder him later. But first I have to make sure you're glamorous!\" Sway waited until Paul had her out of the door before turning to the quiet man. \"So you guys are okay now?\" Sphinx nodded, looking at ease and haggard all at the same time. She smiled. She knew that look well from when Memphis and her fought. Apparently Sphinx hadn't had it as easy as the others had thought he had. He had worked for her forgiveness just like Memphis . . . but unlike Memphis he apparently had enough sense to keep his mouth shut about it. And not bitch because he'd had to do it. Smart man . Too bad that intelligence didn't pop up before he'd almost sabotaged his own relationship by overreacting. \"Well, just to let you know . . . I mean I know you two are going to fight and all . . . but if you need advice just ask me or Junie okay? Do not under any circumstances listen to the Raines brothers or Jackson. Actually the only men you should consider listening to should be Otto or Donnie. The rest of them don't have a clue.\" Sphinx snorted but nodded, taking her advice. Sway smiled, nodding. \"Well, I'm off to keep Cinderella from bashing in her hairdresser's head. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and get dressed. It'll save time. And Sphinx?\" He looked up at her, confused. \"I'm glad you two worked it out. You both deserve to be happy. And I honestly don't see that happening with you two being apart. You're damned near perfect for each other.\" She smirked, her eyes taking on a wicked glint as she went to walk out of his apartment. \"Besides, who else has a soft spot for homicidal boosts and a bean pole of a brother who can kick your ass back into line if he tried to?\" And with that she was gone before he could glare at her, her laughter following her to the elevator. Sphinx kept glancing down at Chaosia as he drove the red Aston to the Museum. Dear Lord why did Sway have to develop a hidden talent for picking mouthwatering dresses? And Paul was definitely up a few more notches in his opinion for the hair and make-up. Not that she needed it, oh no. The way the dress was hugging every curve and detail of her toned little physique, Chaosia could've shown up in the dress with flip flops and her damned glasses and still been the belle of the ball. The jaw dropping gown was a sleek fitted white satin encrusted with sequins that seemed to reflect the light even when she was sitting still, making the entire dress seem to be made of diamonds of jewels. The one shouldered top was embellished with diamond encrusted rings that linked the front and back fabric. And speaking of back . . . dear God the back. The low open back had his mouth watering as it bared both the toned muscle and her tattoo, all without showing off too much of her scarring. That, coupled with the moderate slit in the front (to allow movement for dancing and sitting Sway had sworn) had him wondering if maybe Sway should pick Chaosia's dresses from here on out. All the ones Chaos seemed to pick had this retro quality to them that made them seem sweet and sexy. And though he liked that, seeing her like this made him want to see her like this more often. Chaosia shifted in her seat, refusing to look at him, causing the light from the passing streetlights to illuminate her face. Her eyes had been done in a neutral shadow with this barely there silver glint and the rest seemed like she wasn't wearing anything at all, save the mascara making her lashes appear even fuller and longer. But her lips were killing him. The rich, vibrant red stain made her lips seem even fuller while the gloss seemed to make them shine like glass. Her hair was pulled away from her face and back into this intricate style of curls and ringlets that Paul had managed to swoop to one side, a Grace Kelly effect is what he'd claimed. The huge diamond earrings and the diamond cocktail ring finished off the look and Sphinx was beginning to wonder if she'd be mad at him for just turning around and going home so he could undress her . . . He shook his head, reaching out to take her hand. She looked at him and sighed, holding his hand and squeezing it. \"You could've just told me. Hell, you can tell me now so I know where we're going so I'm not going crazy . . .\" He smirked, pulling to a stop at the light on Ocean Blvd. just beyond the museum. At least they were almost there. \"You'll see soon enough, Love. 'Sides, if I told you it wouldn't be a surprise now would it?\" She glowered before rolling her eyes. \"If this is because of the fight-\"\"It isn't, not entirely. I bought the bloody tickets for this when you're family was Stateside . . .\" She looked up at him and he was suddenly very uncomfortable. Jesus what had he said wrong now ? \"You planned this before your jackass moment?\" He nodded, pulling away from the light and towards wherever they were going as Chaosia watched him, amazed. She would've never thought in her whole life that Sphinx had a romantic bone in his body that didn't involve sex or cuddling. And yet here he was proving it. And he'd planned this before he'd almost ended their relationship . . . She looked down at their joined hands, running her thumb over his much larger one. He squeezed her hand reassuringly before taking it back. She looked up, noticing they were at the museum and it seemed ready to burst with activity. She looked over at him, confused. Sphinx seemed almost sheepish as he kept his eyes on the road into the parking complex for the museum, refusing to look at her. \"You said you wanted to go dancing so . . . what better place than a gala, right?\" She felt her heart melt. He might be an ass sometimes but when he wanted to be her boyfriend was amazing. Now if they could just convince him to want to be amazing all the time . . . oh the possibilities. She shook herself, smiling at him as he took the ticket and parked where the attendant told him to. Severe and rough around the edges is what she fell in love with . . . and it's what she wanted. For the most part. Besides, she could be just as contrary so . . . He got out, coming around to open the door for her and hold out his hand to help her out of the low sitting car. She knew she was blushing as he pulled her to her feet and held her while she steadied herself on the heels but seeing the way he was looking at her . . . she honestly couldn't care less. He dipped down, kissing her cheek before offering her his arm like a proper gentleman. She laughed and took it, enjoying the playful glint to his eyes as they made their way to the entrance. This was going to be fun. And interesting. Sphinx watched Chaosia laugh as he spun her out and back into him as they danced. The second she was back against him, her arms were right around his neck as his own locked round her hips. He smiled down at her, enjoying watching her laugh and dance. She enjoyed the primary exhibit and the others that could be seen. She'd told him about styles and mediums and techniques and pointed out pieces that were her favorites. She'd sipped champagne and talked with his supervisor (who was thrilled to meet her and more than a little shocked at how she was apparently). She'd even made nice with Richards and Newman. And thankfully, the intern Meghanne was here with another chap so she was leaving them mostly in peace, save a few glances their way. He dipped down, rubbing his cheek against hers. \"Are you happy?\" She laughed, cheeks flushed from the alcohol and the exercise as she nodded, kissing his cheek as she held him to her. The music switched to something slower and they just moved together, flowing with the tempo and enjoying the closeness. She pulled back and smiled at him, cupping his cheek in her palm. \"I am very happy, Sphinx. Extremely happy. Thank you for this. It means the world to me.\" He nodded his head once, kissing her palm before covering it with his own and just dancing. He'd fucked up but . . . he had a chance to make all of this right. And this had been the proper first step. Her smile told him so. As the music panned out, she glanced up at him, a wicked gleam in her eye. \"So . . . we've been here a few hours . . . what do you say to going home and doing some dancing there?\" He smirked down at her rakishly. He loved that idea. \"Sure, Love, whatever you want.\" She smiled, leaning up to kiss him on the lips as he leaned down to meet her. Thank God most of the people he worked with were already so toasted they wouldn't remember this . . . While he was going to be different with Chaosia (at least somewhat), the others had better not expect shit from him. He did have a reputation to protect after all. When they parted, he led her off the dance floor and towards the door, stopping only to nod to his supervisor and bid him farewell before going to the waiting Aston. When they got home . . . Not quite there yet but he's making huge steps. The next chapters will be up soon. Oh and the other story Sides of Coffee is now going to be a dumping ground for all of the random thoughts that fill my brain including these stories. And not just about Sphinx and Chaosia. So if you have a request or want to see a particular scenario just drop me a line or whatever. I know, I know I'm goofy. Okay. Later.[Chapter 25] This is going to be so much fun! Chapter Twenty Five! Yay! Christmas Came Early Chaosia kept going back through her bags for the millionth time, checking to make sure she had everything she could possibly need while Sphinx just looked at her like she was insane. He couldn't help it. She had two, not one but two sets of Louis Vuitton hard sided monogram luggage and four separate soft side keep-alls and then there were the bloody cases. She had two hard jewelry cases and one huge cosmetics case that she had stuffed full of things he didn't even know she had. She'd pulled dresses he hadn't even thought she'd dream of touching from her office closet and suits and the most . . . un -Chaosia styled clothing he could've imagined. All for whatever formal occasions she would have to attend while in Britain. And that was just for her. He'd already caught sight of the seven boxes from Harrods's in London that she'd ordered for him. Part of Christmas she'd told him . . . He grumbled, glaring at the luggage in the hallway. Part of his punishment is more like it. How many times did he have to apologize for being a total ass before she quit torturing him? He sighed, watching her pack again as she muttered angrily to herself. All in all, they were looking at fourteen suitcases and six carry-ons for her alone. He shook his head, barely dodging the shoe that she tossed out of her luggage before backing out of the bedroom completely. He was no idiot, she was going to kill someone the way she tossed things about packing it wasn't going to be him. He walked back down her hallway to find Mikhail still sitting on the couch sipping a lukewarm beer. The despondent boost motioned to the other side and handed him one of the remaining beers from the six-pack he'd brought with him. Sphinx nodded, popping the beer and downing half of it in one go before dropping to the couch beside the younger man. Mikhail had been sulking since he'd been reminded he was forbidden from accompanying them this trip . . . And the only thing that seemed to cheer him up was that he got to drive Chaosia's Aston while she was out of the country . . . and she'd given him two tickets to some high-to-do art show for him and Monique for Christmas. But what baffled Sphinx the most was how the boy perked every time he heard Chaosia's sounds of frustration at packing and choosing wardrobes. As a matter of fact, Mikhail was wearing that all knowing smug smirk on his face as he heard Chaosia growl and something else hit the wall. He chuckled and turned to Sphinx and shook his head, the smirk never leaving his face. \"I do not envy you, brother. She's a maniac when it comes to packing and to go deal with Pop's family . . . you'll be grey or bald by time you get back, mark my words.\" Sphinx rolled his eyes but knew it was probably true, fingering the small blue box in his pocket absent mindedly. He couldn't even remember what had made him start carrying the damned thing with him but he was. Probably Atley . He'd taken his friend's advice and bought Chaosia not one but three very nice presents that had set him back a great deal . . . Actually as he had paid for the last two gifts (which for him had been painful enough), he'd been glad that his overly frugal lifestyle and borderline obsessive saving habits had been in place for the past fifteen years. And that Chaosia wasn't averse to his boosting to recoup what he'd spent. He still had more than enough money stashed away to make at least three more purchases like the ones he'd made without even dipping into the numerous CDs and stock holdings he'd accrued over the years . . . but he had to be smart about investing and spending to keep suspicions down. While pathologists (especially ones with the forensic training he was always updating) made more than enough to justify what he usually spent . . . he didn't want to tip anyone of that he had considerably more. And from a not-so-legal source of revenue. Hell, even Atley didn't know how much he had tucked back . . . and he told him almost everything. A muffled round of cursing brought him from his thoughts and made him want to reconsider this trip. Again. Chaosia had gotten more and more stressed over the past month . . . The closer it got to time for their vacation, the more she seemed ready to burst and he had been worried to death. She'd actually been so frantic that she'd worried herself sick. So sick that he'd actually almost forced her to go to the damned doctor. She was throwing up and tired and of this was what this trip was going to do to her then they weren't going. Period. They weren't supposed to leave until tomorrow and she had worked herself into frenzy. He sighed, looking to Mikhail. After their own fight the two of them were getting on much better than before, and Sphinx hadn't thought it was possible. The fact drove Chaosia mad, something about men ' duking it out and then being buddies 'til death' or some nonsense like that. \"Is she always like this?\" Mikhail chuckled, nodding. \"Dude you should've seen her when she was packing when she was eighteen to go see her grandmother. I swear she almost worried herself sick. And she repacked like eight times before Mom made her stop and hid her luggage.\" Sphinx sat back, some of his worry for Chaos dissipating as he heard she'd done this before. At least it meant she wasn't sick. \"I'll be glad when we get there then. Maybe she'll be able to bloody eat and keep it.\" Mikhail stopped mid drink, choking and spewing beer all over his sister's coffee table and Sphinx. Sphinx looked down at his now beer soaked shirt and rolled his eyes, counting to twenty in his head to keep from strangling him. \"She's been sick? Like sick sick? She never gets sick. Ever . Even over this. Is she okay?\" Sphinx looked at him, suddenly more worried about the cursing idiot down the hall than before. He shrugged, eying Mikhail. \"Yeah, boy-o. She's been throwing up for a week now. And tired. I almost made her go to the doc's . . .\" Mikhail paled, getting up and running down the hall to his sister's room, leaving Sphinx to follow. When he got there, Mikhail had a hand on Chaosia's forehead and she looked bewildered. And frustrated. \"Have you been running a fever? Do you think its serious? Are you dying? Why didn't you tell me?\" She shook her head, pushing him away. \"No idiot. It's just a damned stomach bug. Paul had it last week and decided to share . Jeez. Lighten up will ya?\" He nodded, still not trusting her by the look on his face. Sphinx just shook his head going back into the living room. If anything was wrong Chaosia would tell him . Right? Sphinx watched Chaosia sleep on the plane, chuckling. She had literally worn herself out trying to get them to their destination. She'd gotten up at four, showered and dressed and they'd eaten. Mikhail came by at eight and drove them to the garage where Chaosia had dispersed two huge bags full of gifts to both crews, even Junie and Otto. Donnie had gotten both books that he'd talked about wanting to read while Memphis and Sway were gifted with three huge canvas prints of car themed photos for their home (Eleanor, the Classic 1971 Lamborghini Miura and a black-and white image of them working together on an old 50's model truck and smiling at one another). Kip and Mirror both received radar detectors while Tumbler got a set of vintage boxing gloves. Toby got a slim cased jimmy set complete with a stop watch to practice his boosting while Freb got a surfing care kit. Junie and Otto were gifted with a webcam and an instructional manual on how to operate the camera and the computer their son had sent them. Junie had cried when Chaos had brought out the prettily wrapped boxes and told them that it would help them see their grandkids that lived on the East Coast more often, hugging her and weeping into her charcoal tee shirt before Otto pried her off and hugged Chaosia for the thoughtful gift. Atley however, got the neatest thing in Sphinx's opinion and he knew Chaosia had out extra thought into his best friend's gift. Well, gifts. Chaosia had overheard Atley lamenting the demise of his favorite leather jacket on one of his many visits and had searched to find one as similar as she could . . . and she had. Atley kept staring at the Diesel leather motorcycle styled jacket and the Diesel IP Shield digital watch she'd sound to match it like it would disappear. He'd thanked her, nodding and tracing the piping on the jacket as he looked at it, a huge grin on his face. Chaosia had smiled and told all of them that there were normal Christmas cards in the bottom of their boxes . . . and Sphinx had been extremely surprised when Atley showed him that they were all signed in Chaosia's looping and elegant script with best wished for the season and the new year with both of their names. He'd enjoyed watching the crew, in turn, give her their gifts. The younger crew had gone in together and purchased the new intake system for her Chevelle, informing her that they would have it and the sound system Mirror and Toby had put together installed and perfect by the time they got back from London. Otto and Junie had found a collection of art and photography books at a vintage store and knew she would love the vintage find. She had, promising to read them on the plane and when she had a spare moment in London. Donnie had gotten her a new pad of the thicker paper she preferred for her charcoal and ink sketched while Atley had shocked both of them, handing each of them tiny black boxes with white ribbon. Atley, in true Jackson fashion, gotten both of them the oddest key rings. Hers with a sphinx and his with a phoenix, telling them that it just seemed right for them. Sphinx snorted, knowing that Atley meant for him to put the spare key he'd had made for Chaosia on the ring and encourage her to do the same. Sway, however, had pulled Chaos to the side, handing her a small gift bag and letting her open it away from everyone else. Sphinx had only seen that it was a picture frame before Chaos's eyes had teared up and she threw her arms around Sway's shoulders. Sway had smiled and blushed, shrugging and refused to look at Sphinx . . . and told Chaos no to let any of the others see it. A muffled murmur broke his thoughts and brought his gaze to Chaosia. At least they were in First Class so they could stretch out for the ungodly long flight. Sphinx sighed, looking down at his lightly snoring lover. Her head was on his shoulder and she was wrapped in a blanket the stewardess had draped over her a few minutes after she'd dozed off. He envied her ability to sleep while he was stuck awake. He shifted; spotting the gift bag from Sway nestled at her feet. He shrugged, reaching down to get it, knowing that one of the books from Junie and Otto was in it. If he was going to be trapped on this plane for the next million hours he could read while she slept. When his fingers hit the cool glass and metal of the frame, he pulled it out and looked at it, curious as to what had prompted such a reaction from Chaos earlier. He almost dropped it in his shock. There, printed in black and white encased in the sleek silver frame and glass was a picture of him and Chaosia in her bed. She was wearing his Wales tee shirt and sprawled across his chest, a small smile on her lips as she slept. But what threw him was how he looked. He was shirtless and had his arms wrapped around Chaos with his fingers in her hair, looking so at peace he almost didn't recognize himself. He looked more like his younger brother than he did his normal serious self . . . No wonder Chaos had been so shocked by the gift . . . he hadn't even known Sway had ever taken this picture, much less printed and framed it. He carefully put the photo back in the bag and procured the book, smirking when he saw it was a photographic compilation of vintage and concept cars with brief histories. At least he'd be entertained while she snoozed. But as he scanned the pages and listened to Chaosia murmur in her sleep, he kept thinking about the photo in the bag at their feet. If he'd ever needed physical proof as to how he felt about her or how much he meant to her. . . it was in that bag. And that tidbit made the long flight just a bit more bearable and what he had planned all the more plausible. I know it was a shorter chapter but it was necessary. On to Chapter Twenty Six! Landing in London![Chapter 26] Okay. Chapter Twenty Six! I have as many chapters as reviews ! Unexpected Gifts are the Best Kind Chaos groaned as she tossed the last bag on the bed in the lake house's master bedroom. God, why did she pack so damned much? She turned; watching Sphinx toss the other bags on the floor as he dropped on the bed. Jet lag was not being kind to either of them. Her father had insisted they eat dinner with him and hadn't let them get settled or unpacked before hands. As they had eaten and Sphinx had been introduced (forced to meet) her extended family, her father had announced at the table, with Selene and her children present that her step sister Jacqueline was getting married in the spring. Selene however didn't seem too happy about the brusque looking boy beside her problematic daughter. And Chaos couldn't blame her. He seemed like a dick. But then again, Jacqueline had always been a bitch so they were probably perfect for each other. She sighed, spreading out beside Sphinx and laying her head on his chest. She smiled when his hands found their way into her curls and started twirling. He had been very well behaved at dinner and considering Christmas was only two days away, she was hoping it was a good sign. She kissed his chest, causing him to pull her closer and kiss her curls. \"You feeling any better Love?\" She shook her head, forcing herself to stay in bed and not in the bathroom where she wanted to be. She had hoped that after they'd gotten off the plane and back on solid ground that her stomach would settle . . . but when she'd ended up puking at her father's with Selene of all people holding her hair she knew it was a wasted hope. She grumbled and reminded herself to kill Paul. This was not what she had wanted from him for Christmas. She always had gotten airsick and this stomach bug was going to be the death of her. Besides, she'd already lost ten pounds and she couldn't afford to lose any more . . . \"No. I really don't want to be sick for Christmas but it looks like Paul just had to give the gift that keeps on giving. A diet by force.\" She sighed, kissing his chest. \"I love you.\" He rubbed her back, working a particularly tight muscle as he responded. \"I love you too, Love . . . but you're starting to worry me. Do you need to see a doc?\" She shook her head, snuggling closer to him. \"If I don't feel better in the morning I'll have Selene make an appointment. Deal?\" He nodded, and she could tell he was drifting off to sleep. She giggled. Of course he wouldn't care about sleeping in their clothes . . . oh to hell with it. They'd unpack tomorrow morning. She was going to sleep, too. Sphinx watched Chaosia paced as she worked herself into a frenzy. Again. She had something to tell him and was being rather bull headed about just telling him. So he'd spent the past forty minutes watching her pace and fret and nearly bite her bottom lip in half. He sighed, rising from the sofa in her father's office and catching her by the shoulders forcing her to stop and face him. He pushed her chin up to look at him and he hated the look in her eyes. She was nervous. And terrified. \"Just bloody tell me, Chaosia. For Christ sake you act like you're dying or something . . .\" She closed her eyes, letting out a long breath before glaring at him, \"I am not dying . . . . though by the time all of this is said and done with I'm going to wish I was. Selene and I talked while I was waiting to see the doctor and she told me a little more about my stepsister's new beau. He's not exactly what she expected for Jacqueline and normally that would be a great aggravation point . . . but Sphinx this guy is apparently a real fucking jerk. And the only reason they're getting married is because she's pregnant. And I'm apparently expected to be in this shotgun wedding.\" Sphinx looked at her, gears suddenly turning in his own head as he started labeling and categorizing each of Chaosia's symptoms from the past week. Oh Dear Lord she was . . . Chaosia stopped pacing and looked at him, head cocked to the side. \"Uh, Sphinx? Are you okay? You look . . . well, you look green .\" He nodded, sinking back to the sofa with what he knew was a blank face. Chaos knelt in front of him, hand on his forehead. \"Honey, are you okay? You're scaring me.\" He didn't look at her as he answered. \"So you'll both be making your parents grandparents then? I'm guessing that Selene just loved that.\" Chaos sat back, falling on her butt as she looked at him in shock. Finally, she shook her head and started snickering. He growled as her snickers turned into full blown laughter as she literally rolled in floor with tears streaming down her cheeks. \"I don't see how any of this is funny, Chaosia. This changes a lot. We'll have to-\" She wiped her eyes, shaking her head as she sat up, holding her side with her free hand. \"Stop. Stop, I can't take anymore!\" He growled louder, knowing his look was dark and foreboding but refusing to so much as even think of touching her in an even semi-rough way. What if he hurt her? Lord, he would be walking on eggshells for the next . . . eight months. Finally, he couldn't handle her smug and amused look anymore. \" WELL?! WHAT is so bloody FUNNY?! \" She smiled, leaning up to kiss his cheek before taking his hand in hers and patting it lovingly. \"Silly bear. I'm not pregnant . I told you it was just a virus . . . and the Doc agrees. I should be better in the next few days. Just bland food and not a lot of alcohol until I'm a hundred percent . . .\" She eyed him, a knowing glint sparkling in her sea glass irises as her smirk darkened. \"Unless you want me to get pregnant . . . then we could lock ourselves away and practice . . . I mean, I'm sure it would take a while . . .\" He growled, jerking his hand away and shaking his head at her before standing and going to the bar her father had showed him the night before. He poured himself a glass of the oldest Scotch and downed it quickly before refilling it and taking the second one back to the sofa with him, sipping it slowly as he glared at his still preening and giggling girlfriend. It was days like this that her penchant for trouble was nerve racking. \"So what about this bloke then? Shouldn't Selene be happy her daughter is settling?\" Chaos, still mirthful about his misunderstanding, shook her head and sat beside him, stealing a sip of his drink before continuing. \"Apparently not. Jacqueline's not exactly the mothering type you know? Or the faithful type for that matter . . . and this guy is definitely not going to turn out to be Prince Charming . . .\" Sphinx nodded, digesting the new information before looking at her out of the corner of his eye. \"And you're not pregnant?\" She shook her head, smiling at him. \" Nope . Don't worry, Big Boy. If that ever happens, you'll be the second one to know.\" He raised a brow, sitting the now half empty glass on the end table. \"The second ?\" She nodded, stating matter-of-factly, \"Well, yeah. After Paul, you'll be the first person I tell.\" He leaned towards her, glaring at her in disbelief. \" PAUL will know I'm going to be a father before I will?\" She shrugged, flipping her hair over her shoulder and picking at a speck of imaginary lint on her cranberry shawl necked sweater. He tried no to think about how delicious she was in the tight sweater and painted on skinny jeans. If he did, he;d be in even more trouble than he already was. \"Well of course. How else will he know he's got to gear up to be the best fairy godfather in the world?\" Sphinx groaned and closed his eyes, slumping back into the sofa cushions as she watched him. \"Oh yes. Of course. How silly of me to think I would get to know first.\" Finally, she stood and straightened her shirt before dipping to kiss his cheek and wink. \"I Love you.\" He opened an eye, snorting at her causing her to giggle and smack him. \"Oh sure you do. You'll just tell him first.\" She stopped, looking at him oddly. \"You'd really want to know? I mean, before everyone else like my Dad and Paul?\" He nodded, closing his eyes again. He tried to think of how to word this and finally gave up, just deciding to speak his piece and deal with the aftermath. \"Well of course I would, Chaosia. I may not plan on children now but . . . I would want to know if . . .\" He sighed, sitting up and looking at her. \"I want to know if it happens. Because if it does . . . well, we'll deal with it.\" She quirked a brow. \"We'll deal with it ?\" He nodded, moving quickly to keep the hint of a anger in her voice from growing. \"Yeah. Things 'ill need to be arranged and hell . . . we'll have to make changes . . . but we'll deal with it. Together . I'm not adverse to children, Chaosia. I just never planned on them . . .\" Chaosia felt her heart stop as Sphinx finished his thought. She'd have never guessed he'd even entertained a passing thought about kids in his life. But it was nice to hear that if it happened then it wouldn't end up ending them . . . or landing him the morgue for making the same stupid request she still had to tell him about. She sighed, leaning over and kissing his cheek. \"Thank you.\" He looked at her like she was crazy. \"What the hell for?\" She just smiled, shrugging. \"Proving you're a decent guy . . . I don't doubt it but after the other stuff Selene told me I almost lost my faith in men period. Apparently, Ambrose didn't want Jacqueline to keep the baby at first. He was pushing hard for an abortion until his father and Selene found out about the pregnancy and put an end to it . . .\" Sphinx's face darkened as he picked up the glass and downed the rest of the Scotch, shaking his head. He set the now empty glass down, looking to her. \"That's an asinine thing to do. If the woman wants to go that route so be it but to try and force it is just . . . insane. Besides, the bloke didn't want the possibility then he shouldn't have dipped his wick then should he? Stupid blighter.\" Chaosia smiled, shaking her head at his gruff tone though she agreed with him. Sphinx was definitely surprising her today. She really did have a decent guy. Even if she did have to pry conversation out of him with a crow bar sometimes. Christmas Eve was an interesting affair. Chaosia's family was loud and numerous, cousins and aunts and uncles seemingly crawling from the woodwork to meet her \"new boyfriend from the States\". Something that was keeping Sphinx as close to her and her father as he could get without blatantly shunning the continuously approaching hoard. The only person he'd met that he could even somewhat tolerate was her second cousin Melisande (who insisted on being called Mel much to most of the other's chagrin) and she seemed content to be joined with Chaosia at the hip, drinking and smoking as they gossiped and whispered. Sphinx shook his head as the two stared at some distant relative's hideous dress, commenting back and forth as they emptied their eighth drinks. \"Oh, Aunt Beatrice is wearing your old couch as a dress, Mel! Did she ask before she stole it?\" Mel swatted at Chaos, giggling as Chaosia's father rolled his eyes and handed Sphinx another drink. \"No you silly girl. She didn't even have the courtesy to ask before stealing it away and having some troll fashion it into that! I miss my couch . . . such fond memories.\" Chaosia laughed, shaking her head before smiling at Sphinx. She turned to her father. \"Well, Daddy. We're going to head back to the Lake House. It's late and I'm exhausted. I love you and we'll see you for brunch.\" Her father nodded, draining his drink and hugging Chaosia before shaking Sphinx's hand. The two of them had had a nice long chat after Chaosia had broken the news of Jacqueline's pregnancy . . . and they had come to an understanding of sorts. Guadimus had even given his blessings on what Sphinx planned to do but with a warning. \" Break her heart again, boy, and there won't be a safe place to hide. They'll never find you after you're bagged and tagged. Clear ?\" Sphinx sighed, shaking the warning from his head as he followed Chaosia out to the car. He was glad she'd requisitioned her V12 Vantage from her father for the duration of their stay . . . and he was steadily convincing himself to get her to have it shipped to the States. The One-77s were nice but this thing flew. And good God did she look great behind the wheel. As they navigated the roads back to the Lake house, Sphinx began thinking of the best time to give Chaosia her gifts . . . and decided as soon as they got back to the house he would pull out all three. He just hoped she wouldn't react the way he was expecting her to. Chaosia sat on the edge of the bed in their bedroom, watching Sphinx pull a rather large box from one of his bags and a small blue box with a white ribbon on it. She chewed on her lip, suddenly nervous as to what he'd gotten her and why he seemed so damned serious all of a sudden. As soon as they'd gotten inside, he'd pulled her to the master bedroom and sat her on the bed. He'd kissed her and told her, \"You're going to open these two first and if you want the third you'll tell me.\" She'd nodded and he handed her the smaller box first. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw it wasn't any little blue box, but a Tiffany's blue box. She looked up at him, brow raised as he nodded and she carefully opened it. There in the box on the pillow setting was a pendant chain necklace with two keys and two small tags that were engraved. She felt her mouth drop as she pulled it free, looking at the first key closely. It was a black titanium masculine but antique styled key, with the small matching platinum tag reading Sphinx. She felt her eyes water but forced herself to examine the other. It was gorgeous and very feminine platinum key that was completely covered in diamonds. The small platinum tag beside it had a tiny diamond on it as well, with Chaosia engraved beside the stone. All together, the two keys on the long platinum chain were dainty and beautiful but Chaos knew just from the box and the glittering diamonds on her key that this had cost him a fortune. She looked up at him and couldn't do anything but let the tears trickle down her cheeks. It was perfect. \"I love it Sphinx. Thank you . . . you have no . . . I love it . And I love you. \" Sphinx reached out and brushed the tears away, handing her the larger gift after he helped her slip the necklace over her head. It fell just above the valley of her breasts and glittered in the low light of the room. She smiled, holding the other present as she just looked down at the necklace and enjoyed the weight around her neck. She'd never though he'd get her jewelry . . . especially something that bound them like this necklace did. She fingered the white ribbon, almost afraid to open it as he watched her. Finally, she slipped the ribbon off and carefully tore the paper away, looking down at the plain white box confused. Sphinx nodded at her to open it and she slid her fingers under the lid, ripping the tape to reveal a bone white pea coat with a wide collar and dark charcoal buttons. She pulled the coat out, noticing the slight puff to the sleeves and the satin lining before seeing the charcoal scarf beneath it with the matching gloves. She raised a brow at him as he shrugged, explaining. \"You didn't have a proper coat for a London winter, Chaos. Even that old trench of yours won't hold up against the rain and snow.\" She nodded, smiling at the sensibility behind the second gift before sitting the box aside. She leaned down and reached beneath the bed, handing him two wrapped boxes. \"Well, I guess you can open mine now.\" He rolled his eyes, opening the largest first to reveal a new dark black pea coat of his own, as well as a new pair of charcoal suspenders. She smirked, kissing his cheek. \"I guess great minds think alike, huh? Go ahead. Open the next one.\" He opened the smaller box, amazed at what was there. A ring. He looked up at her, questioningly as she rushed to explain. \"Atley gave me the key to your Malibu that broke a few weeks ago and I had it molded into that ring. See? The key cut is still there in the middle and I figured you could always keep a piece of your Baby Blue with you. Don't worry, it's sized for your right hand . . . Do you like it?\" He just looked at it before pulling it from the box and slipping it on his hand, testing the weight, Chaosia hardly noticing it went on his left hand instead of his right until he spoke. \"It perfect but it'll need to be sized so I won't lose it.\" She quirked a brow, confused as she saw it was loose on him. That didn't make any sense. \"But . . . I made sure it would fit so you wouldn't have to do anything . . . Wait, why is it on that hand? Sphinx?\" He knelt in front of her, still looking at the ring on his finger and she felt her heart clench painfully. He didn't like it. \"If you don't like it its okay . . . I mean I can get you something else and-\" He laid a hand over her mouth, shaking his head. \"It's a fine, p roper gift Chaosia. Besides . . . I guess that means that this would be a good time to give you your last Christmas present.\" He pulled another small blue box from his jacket pocket and Chaosia felt her heart stop as he placed it in her hands. She looked down at the blue Tiffany's box, afraid to breathe on it for fear it might disappear. He didn't . . . this wasn't . . . was it? Sphinx grumbled, taking the thing back and slipping the ribbon off, opening the box and handing her the ring box inside the decorative package. He deftly opened it and Chaos couldn't stop the fresh tears from spilling down her cheeks. The ring was beautiful and elegant. And huge. If the size was anything to go by, Sway and Junie had helped with this. She looked up at him, amazed. \"I thought I was supposed to tell you when all of this stuff hit my brain.\" He shrugged, pulling the glittering ring from the box and slipping it on her finger. It looked huge against her hand but somehow it was just like him. Unexpected and beautiful and perfect for her. \"I know but I saw it and . . . I figured we could get married after you graduate in the spring or whenever you wanted to. . . if you weren't averse to marrying me after I made such an ass of myself before.\" She nodded, still looking down at the ring in amazement. She couldn't believe this. He'd gotten her a ring. H E'D gotten her a RING . Dear God, he was asking her to marry him. Finally, she snapped out of it and flung herself on him, crying and kissing his cheek as he wrapped his arms around her and let out this long, deep sigh. She pulled back, nodding and rested her head against his forehead, not caring that she was blubbering like an idiot. She hadn't expected this at all. Especially after Thanksgiving . . . \"How long have you been planning this?\" He shrugged and she swore she saw a blush creep on his cheeks. Her boyfriend-no, not boyfriend-her fiancé was blushing! \"I bought the ring the week after I took you dancing . . . I was with Memphis to get Sway's sized and I saw this and . . . It all just fell into place. I wanted to see you with a ring like this. And not just because you wanted it. I love you, Chaosia . . . and I want as much of you and your life as you'll give me.\" She laughed, kissing him lightly. \"Silly bear. You already have all of it. Don't you know that?\" Sphinx lay there in bed, hours later, listening to the rain fall outside on the lake. Chaosia was stretched across his bare chest, sleeping soundly as he turned the ring on her finger. He still couldn't believe she'd said yes. But he was thrilled she had. He knew this was a huge step, and an early one . . . but it felt right. Besides, they had time to work out the rest. She'd told him she wanted to wait until she graduated (like he'd expected) and have their wedding in May . . . which had made him smirk and chuckled at her. She wanted to let it warm up enough for a mice outdoor wedding without the rains that usually accompanied April. She sighed, snuggling closer and murmuring in her sleep. If anyone had told him three months ago that he'd be lying in bed with a woman he didn't mind spending the rest of his life with . . . he'd have laughed in their faces. But here he was, in London and lying in bed with Chaosia and thinking that the ring she'd gotten him was perfect for his wedding band . . . after it was sized. As he listened to the rain and Chaosia's contented sighs, he drifted to sleep, thankful that his future bride had doused him with hot coffee . . . and worked her way into his life permanently. Now all they had to do was survive London and tell the others that they were engaged. His eyes shot open and he groaned, running a hand over his face. Dear God he was doomed when they got Stateside. He hadn't told anyone, even Atley what he was planning. God, how was he going to survive this? I'm officially going to sleep now. Later.[Chapter 27] Oh my God. I'm not dead! Sorry to be absent again but this chapter refused to come along at anything even resembling a normal pace. Thanks for the reviews and the continued interest and support. It really means a lot. So . . . on with the show. Oh yes. And I do not own anything here other than my OCs and my Chevelle . . . though I wouldn't terribly mind owning Sphinx . . . Mimosas and Jet Lag The look on Sphinx's face was priceless. Almost as good as when he'd jumped to the conclusion of her being pregnant . . . but she was determined not to laugh at his expense. Much, anyway. Especially since he was on his best behavior for her . . . . And he had yet to start dismembering the overly excited family members . . . . so far . . . That simple fact wouldn't stop her from smirking and enjoying the show from her perch at the bar. Nope. Not one bit. Especially with that vein doing the mambo on his forehead as he tried to keep it together. She watched as her father clapped him on the shoulder, laughing as he talked to her uncle while Sphinx looked as positively uncomfortable as she had ever seen him. Like the new student being introduced to the class on the first day in his underwear or something. Chaosia was almost tempted to go rescue him . . . until then her father turned and locked eyes with her. After a few seconds, his lips spread into that wicked little smirk and he waved before rushing back into the conversation, dragging her poor fiancé along for the ride. Yep that proved it. One of her theories was now sound and the second was steadily solidifying. Chaosia had been pretty sure that her father and step mother secretly hated society (okay she'd known her Dad did but Selene really did seem to eat, drink and sleep this shit) . . . . and were going to use her new fiancé as a weapon of mass destruction. That and her father was using this as his opportunity to pay Sphinx back for the heartache he'd caused her the month prior . . . (which was probably the reason for Sphinx's sudden good behavior where all of this was concerned to be truthful).That was the only thing she could think of as she watched them parade her now grimacing fiancé around in front of all of their society friends with what could only be described as uncontrollable glee. Blissfully unaware of the ticking time bomb they had on their hands . . . Apparently, it thrilled the two idiots to no end that both of their daughters were going the way of matrimonial bliss enough to risk the melt down coming. . . . She sighed, draining her mimosa in one go. Dear God this wedding was going to make her an alcoholic, she just knew it. But at least when they were back stateside she wouldn't have to deal with any of this crap . . . Until April. She cringed, forcing herself no to shutter as she remembered that particular detail. Selene had informed her that she and her father were relocating in April to \"help out\" with the wedding. More like torture her into letting them make it a social extravaganza. Chaosia grumbled, looking to Nigel the bartender to refill her glass. Nigel nodded, quickly and deftly pouring more orange juice and champagne back into the flute before anyone saw him. She nodded, adding another twenty dollars to his already massive tip in her mind. But it was worth it . . . They had a deal. He kept her glass full (inconspicuously of course) and she would insure one hell of a referral and a hefty tip. Which she so planned on delivering. This man was a saint . . . a saint armed with champagne and orange juice. She gulped a big drink down just before Sphinx turned to look at her, brow raised. He apparently wasn't buying the whole \"Chaosia's been drinking the same drink for three hours\" bit like everyone else was. Which was only proof that he knew her better than most of her own flesh and blood . . . A fact that had proved problematic since they'd agreed to tie the knot. He knew when she was close to having a moment of insecurity or didn't want to face the facts of telling everyone else in her family . . . which baffled her to no end. How was this the same man who had deliberately aggravated her to the point of potentially dismembering him when she had her period because he thought it was amusing? And hadn't been able to see that she wasn't really looking for a ring from him at Thanksgiving? She forced a convincing smile, raising her glass to him before he was whisked off to meet her remaining uncles. She sighed, slumping against the bar as the bartender added enough to refill he glass without her even telling him to as she mentally grumbled about the new telepathy Sphinx seemed to have inherited with their damned rings. She looked back, perplexed as Nigel chuckled. \"It's all good. I can tell this is hard on you. Besides, it's a party. No need for empty glasses, right?\" She smirked, shaking her head as she chuckled. She was definitely going to give this man a huge tip. He was practically her lifesaver. Besides, a full glass meant something to focus on other than Sphinx's new Chaos-reading ability . . . and how scrumptious said boyfriend- No. Not boyfriend, fiancé- looked in those fitted black trousers and that nice black dress shirt that was practically stretched across his chest. She smirked, her eyes searching him out as he tried to steal away from Selene again. She knew it was evil, but after she'd learned that he'd told her father what he was planning and hadn't even bothered to hint to her (or Sway who had screamed her ear off for almost an hour in shock when she'd called earlier); she didn't feel quite as bad about offering him up to the sharks and wolves on a silver platter. She smirked again, taking another large drink. She'd go rescue him in about twenty minutes or so. Anything less wouldn't instill Rule Number One. And what is Rule Number One? Never keep thy girlfriend in the dark when she is far more creative in true methods cruel and unusual punishment. She sighed, almost deciding to go save him earlier and forgo Rule training until she saw her Great Aunt Beatrice hug Sphinx. Mel's eyes widened and Selene practical preened, snapping a picture of the horrified look on her future step-son-in-law's face. Chaosia couldn't help it. She choked, spraying the bar with mimosa as she tried to laugh and swallow at the same time. The skin crawling glare her fiancé gave her meant he'd heard. And for the life of her, she couldn't stop laughing at the sight of him long enough to care. Oh sure, she'd pay later . . . but right now, it was too damned funny. She definitely needed copies of that picture for blackmail purposes. Sphinx groaned, throwing his suitcase on his bed before flopping down beside it. London had been fun (partially), and rewarding, but he was glad to be back. He was practically itching to boost something and just drive it into the ground. Chaosia's family was weird. Even for nobility. He'd suffered through an almost never ending parade of aunts and uncles and cousins and family friends that he was sure he would never, ever see again . . . while Chaosia just laughed and let it all happen. Apparently her father's warning had been right. She would feed him to the sharks so she wouldn't have to deal with them. He sighed, running a hand over his face. But it had all been necessary . . . and has much as he'd hated it; he'd loved seeing Chaosia with her cousins. She was almost like a different person. Especially around Mel . . . who had made a point of pulling him aside and telling him about twenty million horrible things she'd do to him should he ever even consider breaking her cousin's heart. Sphinx smirked. The girl had guts . . . no brain but guts. If she ever came to the States, she'd be a proper match for Atley . . . oh wait. She would be Stateside for the wedding . . . He shook his head, clearing the thought before it could properly form. He'd leave matchmaking to Chaos. She was better at it and far sneakier at getting her way. As much as he it pained him to admit it. He laid there on the bed, listening to the sounds of Long Beach as it passed around their apartment complex. God had he missed that sound . . . He might have hailed from England once upon a time but this was home now. More so since it was where Chaosia had informed everyone she was settling. Her family had been disappointed (her father and Mel in particular) but relented to her wishes after her Grandmother had spoken. Sphinx couldn't quite suppress the shudder that tore through him as he remembered the matriarch of the Guadimus family. He'd been alone with her a grand total of an hour and it was very easy to see why everyone bowed before her. She had this air to her that even the biggest and baddest felt small and miniscule when they fell under 4'11\" shadow . . . Hell, even Atley would've been uncomfortable. Everyone except Chaosia. Of course his odd fiancé had to practically run to her and throw her arms around the little biddy, hugging her and talking animatedly as they had tea and cake. She wasn't the least bit fazed by her grandmother's surly attitude and the benefit showed in their relationship. The old woman doted on Chaos and had been happy that she was marrying. She had given him the once over and nodded, sealing his fate and cementing his place within her family as permanent. She'd even smiled to him. A feat that had Selene in a tizzy for almost a day . . . She and Guadimus had been married for ever (according to her anyway) and she still hadn't earned as much as a snarl from the woman. God, he had put up with so much shit the past few weeks that he was about to scream . . . But he was happy she had at least said yes. He sighed, holding his hand up and twirling the ring on his hand. She'd outdone herself with this . . . His thoughts of London and all of the craziness that had been started to fade as his attention shifted to the ring. He'd lived (even if just barely with his sanity intact) and Chaos swore they didn't have to go back every year so he could be content with that . . . he just couldn't believe she'd gotten him a ring. He grinned darkly, closing his eyes for a moment. Now they were both wearing something that branded them as taken . . . and for the life of him, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't care less. He was secretly thrilled every time Chaos had shown off her rings in London. Or when the light caught the stones and they glittered, proclaiming in little bursts of shining prisms that she was his. Permanently. He grinned . His. He really liked the sound of that. A sound in the front of the apartment alerted him to her presence long before she made her way into the bedroom. She sighed, shaking her head as he looked up at her, not bothering to move from his spot on the bed as she leaned against the door frame. He chuckled at the sight of her. He hadn't seen her like this since before they'd left for London. And as nice as it was to see her in all of the finery she'd adopted while visiting her family, he had truly missed this side of her. This was the side he'd gotten to know first, after all. She had already changed into one of his black tee shirts and a pair of old sweats, cuffing them up to her knees. And of course she had on socks but no shoes. Her long hair was piled up atop her head, huge curls spilling out of the messy bun. Her glasses were on and he bet that if she spoke he would see the retainer she so hated to wear but did to avoid braces a second time. God, she looked so damn young when she did this . . . he really did feel like the dirty old man she accused him of being when he won their arguments. Some days it was hard to believe that she was just a few years younger than the younger crew runners . . . but he didn't really care . . . she was his . The glittering rings she'd yet to remove from her finger for any reason practically screamed the fact now . . . He smirked as she slid onto the bed, resting her head on his chest as she curled into his side. He grunted, pushing his suitcase into the floor with a foot as he moved and got comfortable, rubbing his hand up and down her back soothingly as they laid there together in silence. A rare thing for her, that was for sure. He sighed. It really was good to be home. He closed his eyes, drifting to sleep as jet lag and the events of the past few weeks caught up with him. He could tell by her breathing that Chaos was already dead to the world and neither of them had anything to do tomorrow but rest. As he slipped into unconsciousness, he realized that this was how the rest of his nights would be. And that fleeting glimpse of monotony didn't terrify him as badly as he had anticipated it would. Okay so wedding planning or house hunting next? Or both? Hmmm . . . . decisions, decisions . . . Later.[Chapter 28] And here is a new chapter . . . and another will follow quickly- as in the next few days. Review and let me know what you think or how you'd like to see this play out . . . Back in the Swing Chaosia sat in Mikhail's Escalade, trying her best to not squirm in the stifling heat he'd flooded the car with. Only her brother could think a California winter was cold . . . She sighed, looking down at her chocolate men's styled woolen tweed trousers and smoothing the seam. The shifted, readjusting the matching vest over the ruffle collared blue and white striped dress shirt as she looked out of the fogging windows. She knew that if they were caught they would be dead . . . the only question would be who would kill them first . . . Sphinx had no clue she was here with Mikhail, as far as he knew, they would be meeting him and Atley to look at houses after having lunch . . . not a lunch scout for whatever hair-brained boost Kip and the others had taken this time. The only reason she was even here to help with this shop was because of her brooding brother . . . and the too quite Toby in the back seat. Toby had become quite the little runner while she and Sphinx had been in London, but never went solo unless he had to. He usually stayed with Mikhail . . . which is why he was here for this. This being the only way her brother would even consider talking to her after Sway had told them Sphinx had proposed overseas . . . without even cluing the rest of them in on what he was thinking . . . She huffed, flipping her dark curls over her shoulder as they watched the O'Gara Coach Company in Beverly Hills, waiting to see the new Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport roll onto the lot. Chaosia smirked. At least she would get to drive the 16 cylinder monster legally on the test drive she had agreed to do for Mikhail . . . now if only she could find a way to keep her fiancé from finding out she'd, for intents and purposes, taken a key part in a boost. She didn't think Sphinx would overly mind, it was just that he didn't want her to do anything stupid . . . like living up to her threat to have her father's less savory contacts bag-and-tag the intern who was still causing trouble, even with that ring on Sphinx's hand. She growled, causing Toby and Mikhail to look at her. Toby raised a brow while Mikhail just chuckled. \"I would say he was rubbing off on you, little sister. But I know for fact you were already like this before. What's got you growling?\" Chaos glanced at him, before looking back out the window. \"The stupid intern at his work's got me doing more than growling.\" She shifted again, glancing back at her brother before checking the time. They had about ten minutes before they were supposed to go in . . . \"Do you know how many times I've had to stop myself from calling Uncle Top? I know Dad would kill me but if she doesn't get the message I may kill her. It isn't like Sphinx couldn't do away with the evidence.\" Toby choked while Mikhail laughed. He could suddenly see just why the Sphinx was so keen on this girl. She was just as crazy and quirky as he was . . . Toby knew from personal experience that Sphinx would do whatever he thought necessary to achieve his goal . . . and from the words that had just spilled from Chaosia's glossy pink lips she shared that quality. To the same gruesome extent, too apparently. Mikhail just continued laughing as he reached over and patted his sister's arm while Toby took the opportunity and watched the two interact. Though he knew they saw each other regularly, Mikhail was careful to keep his baby sister just out of whatever the crews were up to, never letting her get too close to anything that would get her in trouble should they ever get caught. Which was, according to Kip, how Memphis had been when he was younger and their mother had been alive. That being the case, Toby really only saw the girl these days when she was with Sphinx at the garage or when he'd tag along with Mikhail . . . like he had today. He sighed, watching as the siblings carried on a silent conversation through eye contact. Now that was something that Memphis and Kip had never been able to do, not as long as he'd know them anyway. Mikhail and Chaosia could just look at each other gage the other's thoughts . . . and react accordingly. Like now that they were both getting out of the Escalade and heading towards the dealership. Toby sighed, watching them as they crossed the street and went in, never realizing that they moved around one another, accommodating for the other's movement. As Chaosia waltzed up to the closest sales clerk and started her routine, Toby had to admit that she was good. It was almost like she'd done this before . . . He narrowed his eyes, trying to keep track of them through the glass front of the store. It was still neat to watch all the same, though. Mikhail smirked, watching as Chaos had the sales clerk eating out of her hand within a few minutes. She'd even let the British lilt leak through her voice as she smiled and pranced around the showroom, looking over the shining black Bugatti with a calculating gleam in her eye. Mikhail nodded to a passing clerk, thankful at least, that Chaosia had convinced him to dress the part with her. His dark black slacks and black dress shirt did look good . . . even though she'd forced him to leave the sleeves down and wear cufflinks. He'd drawn the line at the tie she'd held out to him, though. She'd even done his hair, pulling it into a more conservative style of down everywhere but in the front. He was determined to fix it as soon as he was outside . . . whether she liked it or not. He heard her laugh, pulling his attention back to the present. She was walking away from the clerk, keys in hand, with a very forced smile on her lips. As she breezed past him in her 3\" brown leather stilettoes and her chocolate brown suit, she cast him a look that would've made even Sphinx piss himself. He gulped. Maybe he'd pushed her too far by making her come here with him to shop . . . he shook his head, grinning as she poured herself into the driver's seat of their target. She deserved it for telling Sway she was getting married before him. Even if it had been by mistake. As he slipped into the plush leather seats beside her, he knew she was going to make him regret this . . . but it would be worth it to get the info on the car and to get his sister into a better mood. Because seriously, with all of the planning she'd been doing in the three weeks they'd been back, she needed this joyride . . . almost as much as he did.[Chapter 29] I have as many chapters as reviews again! Yay! Of Houses and Stubborness Sphinx and Atley shared a look as the black Escalade tore into the parking lot of the Coroner's Office. Apparently, lunch hadn't gone well. Atley huffed, leaning back against the Malibu as they waited for the idiot to get out of the car . . . and was shocked to see Toby among the siblings. He turned, looking to see Sphinx's eyes narrow and his jaw set. Judging from that look, he seemed to be thinking the same thing Atley was. Whatever had happened before the trio got here wasn't good . . . and definitely boost related. He sighed, turning to look back at his friend. The vein over Sphinx's left temple was actually beginning to throb visibly and Atley swore he could hear the man's teeth grinding down to nothing as he clenched his jaw. This was going to get messy. Chaosia straightened her attire before flipping her curls over her shoulder and out of her face. She was still reasonably upset with Mikhail but seeing Sphinx made it a little better . . . until she noticed he was giving her- correction: Mikhail and Toby one the darkest looks she'd ever seen. She stopped, momentarily wondering if it was safe to approach him at all. She'd seen his temper, heard him let loose on the few occasions they'd argued and she'd never actually doubted his control. But with the way he was practically trying to set her brother ablaze by glare . . . she was beginning to wonder if it was safe to approach him with them. She sighed, shaking her head before continuing forward. She walked right up to him, stepping into the arm he held out for her and buried her nose into his chest before looking up to him. As he held her, the glare softened minutely but not enough to give her any confidence in her idiotic brother's safety. She was going to have to do something to keep this from becoming another brawl . . . Maybe she could convince them that fist fights were only holiday worthy . . . She leaned up on her toes, because even with the three inch heels he still towered over her, and kissed the underside of his jaw, bringing his eyes down to hers. As soon as she had his undivided attention, she crooked her finger at him. Chaosia waited, praying to God that this actually worked. Sphinx just rolled his eyes at his fiancé's antics . . . but dipped his head level with hers anyway. He didn't care what she had to say, that boy knew he didn't want her involved in anything boost related. Period. And there would be hell to pay for involving her in it. And if she couldn't understand that then they needed to have a very serious conversation about her safety and- The rest of Sphinx's thoughts were cut off as her glossy lips slanted against his, moving in an almost frenzied rhythm as she pulled him closer by the lapels of the pea coat she'd gotten him for Christmas. He momentarily forgot their audience and gripped her to him, tightly. As one her hands left the lapel and traveled to tangle itself in his short hair, he had trouble remembering just why he'd been so angry a few seconds before . . . He knew it was important . . . but with her here like this and the taste of her vanilla lip gloss on his tongue . . . he'd remember eventually. A throat clearing brought Sphinx back to the present. He, although unwillingly, pulled himself from Chaosia's lips, turning to see their friends. Atley just looked amused, shaking his head as he leaned against the side panel of the Malibu while Toby was blushing bright enough to match Chaosia's Aston . . . and Mikhail looked torn between being embarrassed and ill. Sphinx felt his anger return, glaring at the boy hard enough to make him squirm. When he went to step forward, Chaos pushed herself against him, holding him in place. He looked down at her as she shook her head. \"Leave it alone for now, okay? Settle whatever latter. We have houses to go look at . . . unless you want to continue to live in separate apartments after we're married.\" He snorted, shooting the paling boost a look that promised he would settle it later before nodding. He turned, stepping away from Chaos to speak with Atley. \"Ride with the kids. Me and the girl have to have a nice little chat.\" Atley chuckled, nodding as he leaned in to whisper. \"Sure, sure. I know all about what kind of chat you're gonna have. Just remember . . . We have to be at the realtors by one. No quickies in the back seat.\" Sphinx growled, causing Atley to move quickly towards the younger boosts, laughing all the way while the others just looked at him puzzled. Sphinx shook his head, opening the door for Chaos as he grumbled to himself. \"Should've never asked 'im to be the best man. He'll be full o' 'imself for years.\" As soon as Sphinx was in the car, Chaosia found herself drug across the center console and into a bruising kiss. One of his hands knotted itself in her curls at the base of her skull as the other cupped her cheek . . . successfully pinning her lips against his as he literally ravished her mouth. Eventually the kiss became less fierce . . . but no less passionate as she got as close to him as possible. When they parted, both were breathless. Chaosia looked at him awed as she sat back, watching him bring the Malibu roaring to life and put her into gear. When they went to pull out into traffic, he reached across and got her hand, playing with the rings on her fingers as shot into the flow of cars, leaving their followers to find their own exit. She shook her head, smiling up at him. \"what was that about?\" He looked at her out of the corner of his eye, shrugging. \"Oh, so I need a reason to kiss you now?\" She shook her head, blushing as he brought their joined hands to his lips as they slowed for a light. He'd been doing small things like this in private since she'd said yes . . . each small thing leaving her a smoldering mess every time. If she'd known agreeing to marry him would've brought this new level of intimacy between them . . . she would've forced Memphis to purchase Sway a ring months before he did at gun point. She smiled at him, forcing herself to focus on the question she'd asked and he'd dodged. Just because she'd used the force of their physical chemistry against him didn't mean she was going to fall into the same trap . . . until they got home and they could act on it anyway. \"Not that, though it was definitely appreciated. The death glare for Mikhail and Toby. I thought you were trying to make them spontaneously combust or something.\" His face darkened and he squeezed her hand lightly, still playing with his rings on her hand. She'd noticed that when he had an issue with something, he'd taken to playing with her rings just like she fiddled with the necklace he'd given her. If she was nervous or upset, she would start to fidget and her hands sought the dark key around her throat every time. It was an odd habit they had both picked up in London . . . and it had traveled back to Long Beach with them. Though she wasn't delusional enough to believe his was from the same doubts she carried. She knew Sphinx was using the rings as a physical anchor to help tie his anger and keep himself in check . . . for her. His voice brought her from her thoughts. \"I don't want you having anything to do with boosts and the boy knows it.\" His eyes cut to her as he pulled into the realtor's lot. \"You get in enough trouble on your own, girlie. I don't want any more to find you if possible.\" Sphinx fought to keep from grinding his teeth again as Chaosia rolled her eyes at him and giggled, patting his hand. He hated it when she did that . . . She leaned over as he parked, kissing from his cheek to the corner of his lips. Now she could do that all damn day . . . \"Silly bear. Who do you think used to help Mikhail shop? I'm a big girl, Sphinx . . . and I'll be honest, your world does interest me . . . but not enough to learn or get too involved. Besides, I got to test drive the new Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport . . . and I think I know what we're going to tell my Gram we want for a wedding present.\" Sphinx turned, looking at her like she was crazy until a thought hit him . . . She'd been behind the wheel of a 16 cylinder street legal race car before she came to see him? \"Any tickets to pay? Is the car still in one piece?\" Her smile turned sour as she smacked him, eying him cynically. \"Ass. Yes the car is fine and I did close to the speed limit. Like you would be able to with a car that'll do over 170 without breaking a sweat or nos.\" He chuckled, leaning into her. His lips ghosted over hers as he spoke, \"No more shops, girlie. No exceptions.\" She pouted, almost kissing him as she asked, \"Even for you?\" Sphinx snorted, rolling his eyes. \"Girl, I'm never going to take you on a shop or a boost . . . but if I did, then it would be the only time. Privilege of matrimony, as it were.\" It was Chaosia's turn to roll her eyes before she closed the tiny space between them. He was so full of himself today . . . She pulled back, opening her door and getting out. As they went to walk inside to wait, she stopped, realizing they'd left out a detail in their house planning. \"Uh, honey? How much do you want to spend?\" Mikhail and the others pulled into the realtor's parking lot, amazed to see Chaosia and Sphinx still outside . . . and arguing from their stance and facial expressions. Sphinx looked like a placating parent while Chaosia looked furious. Mikhail and Atley shared a look as Toby paled. What were they arguing over now? Mikhail snorted. \"Five hundred bucks says its over the money for whatever they get. And how she wants to contribute.\" Atley grinned, nodding. \"Or how he won't let her contribute.\" As Chaosia stood on her tiptoes, clearly whispering some threat to Sphinx by the shocked look on the man's face, Toby shuddered. \"From that look, its probably both.\" Mikhail and Atley nodded, agreeing with Toby's assessment . . . then groaned when Chaosia brought her foot down on Sphinx's toe, stiletto first. And from the look on Sphinx's face, hard . Chaosia spun on her heel, flipping her hair over her shoulder as she marched into the real estate office. Her hard headed fiancé had another thing coming if he thought she wasn't going to let her put forth anything for their house. She had more than enough to help . . . hell, fuck help-purchase the biggest house the realtor could possibly show them. She had never touched her inheritance from her mother . . . always vowing to use it for something worthwhile than some triviality she'd regret later. And this was as worthwhile as it got . . . Why couldn't he just let her be an equal in this? He'd flipped, closing down completely when she'd offered to split the cost of the house with him, only saying that he would purchase whatever she wanted . . . and that was that. She huffed. She should deliberately pick the biggest, ugliest house and want to renovate everything on his dime . . . She shook herself then shrugged, stalking up to the receptionist. By God, they were buying a house and if he didn't like, she'd build him a doghouse.[Chapter 30] I own nothing but the occasional OC and a very old Chevelle that will eventually eat me out of house and home . . . though IF I owned Sphinx I might be willing to share him with Inferno . . . maybe . . . You're a What? Chaosia rode with Mikhail, refusing to even glance at Sphinx as she banished Atley and Toby to the Malibu with her fiancé. Her brother was currently giving her these glances that screamed about how stupid he thought the whole ordeal was . . . but she wasn't forfeiting this one. She had the ability to help insure that they wouldn't have to do all of the stupid financing and down payments, with what her mother and paternal grandfather had left her . . . . not to mention her own money she had stashed back from working for over eleven years . . . Why couldn't Sphinx just swallow some pride and let her help? She sighed, looking out the window at the passing scenery. The real estate agent Ms. Dashell (or Margaret as Atley of all people had been told to call her) had already shown them two other houses and the fight over the price just kept silently heating up with every glance and question. She grumbled, settling deeper into her seat. The man couldn't speak twenty words on their first ten dates but he can ask the bleached blonde model-esque real estate agent twenty million questions. Mikhail clearing his throat brought her out of her thoughts to glance at him. \"IF the two of you can't pick out a damn house, Ripley then how are you supposed to live in it? You both need to compromise here . . .\" Chaosia snorted, rolling her eyes. \"Okay, fine. I'll let him pay for the whole damn thing and be the kept little housewife. After I sprout wings and bring peace to the world, of course.\" Mikhail rolled his eyes, shaking his head as he turned down Quincy Avenue, which was a godsend to both siblings. This was the last house on the list for them today, which meant only another hour of Chaosia pretending to not want to snap Sphinx's head off . . . As they pulled up to the house, Chaosia's jaw dropped. Mikhail was in much the same boat, staring at the house in awe. He looked over at her, smirking. \"I take it by that look you've found your house?\" Sphinx pulled in behind the Escalade, not really looking at the house. Atley had been right-again- they had needed a mediator for this . . . Chaosia just wouldn't give on helping pay for the damned house. Did she honestly think he didn't have enough to provide whatever she wanted? Everything he made per boost was pure fucking profit . . . profit he rarely touched as it was in several CDs gaining interest even as he killed the engine of the Malibu. He growled under his breath. She was so damned stubborn. Toby spoke up as soon as the engine was off, causing Atley and Sphinx to turn and listen. \"You know . . . you probably hurt her feelings. I mean, from what Mikhail says she really resents it when he tries to take care of her . . . even when she needs it. She's pretty much been paying her own way because she could since she was eighteen. Hell, I know she's even helped Mikhail when he needed it and his dad wouldn't.\" Sphinx felt his features darken as he took in that piece of information and Toby was quick to continue. \"And when he goes to pay her back she always refuses. He was actually surprised she asked for help with the apartment. She's independent and has been for years . . . maybe you just need to let her help you. I mean it has to be a big step for her to let that happen . . .\" Atley nodded, agreeing with the boy as Sphinx sat, stunned. Where had the shy and awkward boy he'd been teaching to boost gone and who was this that had replaced him? Finally, Sphinx nodded and opened his door, stretching to his full height as he looked toward the house for the first time. He blinked, registering that Atley had let out a low whistle and Toby was speechless. The house was nice . . . but it was huge. The real estate agent was already telling Chaos about the house and its history when he joined her. He had to say he was shocked when she threaded her fingers through his and squeezed while she practically bounced on her feet as the blonde spoke. \"Now, just to let you know this four-bedroom modern Colonial home has the classic architectural elements and details, such as flying gables, copper spires, wood corbels, and small paned glass windows that make the Colonials so coveted. The interior is just as impressive, with high vaulted ceilings, and a barrel ceiling in the dining room with hardwood and marble floors throughout.\" Sphinx glanced up at the tall greyish brown house, taking in the glass windows that covered the tallest portion of the front. Chaosia glanced up at him, smirking as she drug him behind the agent to the huge ebony wood door beneath the roof overhang. As the woman opened the door, they were brought into a large open foyer, light from the plethora of windows illuminating the house without the need for flipping the lights. As they walked through the foyer, Chaosia was quick to point out the deep coat closet to the right. \"Now, beyond here to the right is the study, thought the owner actually used it as a guest room, with a full bath with a secondary door that leads back into foyer for public use.\" Sphinx glanced around the 12' x 18' room, nodding as Chaosia inspected the walk-in closet and the large bathroom. He stepped in behind her, noting the rather nice freestanding shower with five showerheads protruding from what appeared to be slabs of stone tile. The floor of the shower seemed to be made of river rocks, something Chaosia had tossed around doing in her own second bathroom a few months ago. The vanity was a nice size and the taupe walls made the cool tone of the stone seem warmer. Sphinx nodded again, impressed as Chaosia followed through the secondary door back into the foyer. \"Straight ahead is the spacious great room with vaulted ceilings. The high ceilings allowed for the large picture window above the rear glass doors, which gives you amazing views into the open veranda beyond.\" Sphinx looked out the huge windows to the stone veranda and the multitude of plants and flowers. Tucked to the side was a small stone fireplace and built in benches. He could see the crew cookouts happening out here ever so often . . . Otto and Junie would probably be thrilled at getting a break from all of the drama being at the garage. \"The great room is open to the kitchen, which features a walk–in pantry and a center work island. Most of the appliances are stainless steel and commercial grade . . . just to let you know double oven and eight eye stove are both gas. Actually the only appliance in here that isn't stainless is the fridge . . . which is right here.\" And with that, the woman pulled one the long drawer pulls near the pantry door open to reveal the inside of a huge refrigerator. \"These two drawers beneath are a meat drawer and an additional freezer. The fridge was specially made so it would incorporate into the mahogany cabinetry. It has a life time warranty that will pass with whoever purchases the house.\" Atley walked into the kitchen behind Sphinx, looking around the large space appreciatively as Mikhail and Toby followed him like shadows. Sphinx shook his head and continued after Chaos and the agent. \"This is the dining room, which features the barrel ceiling and here,\" she motioned to a nook filled with matching mahogany cabinets, \"Is a separate buffet area for serving and additional storage. The kitchen is open to both the dining room and the glass enclosed breakfast nook, which brings in the sunshine and showcases variety of outdoor views. If you notice, these are the same windows that are on the front portion of the house. This nook stands 23' high with the spiraling branch and wire chandelier that cascades down.\" Sphinx looked up, noticing the chandelier that for intents and purposes looked like a tree was sprouting from the ceiling and growing towards the table, a plethora of tiny white buds and lights shining in the light from the windows. He glanced over at Chaos and knew that this house was winning her over piece by piece with all of the small details . . . and they hadn't even gotten to the damn bedrooms yet. \"Next to the kitchen are the powder room, fully furnished laundry room with HE washer and dryer and another built in laundry center similar to the buffet in the dining room, the mud hall to the garage, and stairwell to the bonus room above the garage.\" Chaosia turned, looking to Sphinx as she asked the realtor, \"And how many cars can the garage hold?\" The realtor smirked, taking them past the kitchen and into the hallway to the garage. She opened the door and flipped the light on, illuminating the huge space . . . and the smaller nook to the back that already housed a very impressive set of garage styled shelves and two huge tool boxes. Sphinx found himself wanting to join Mikhail and Toby as they walked over, oohing and ahhing at the fact that the outlets on that side of the garage were all 320 and 410 . . . which meant the ability to hook up most of the high powered tools he used to tune and upkeep the Malibu. Atley grinned as the realtor chuckled. Chaosia and Sphinx both looked at her, puzzled. \"Oh, I knew that this would be a great bonus for you. I mean, that car you drive is a classic . . . and the fact you asked about the garage before the bedrooms . . .\" She laughed as Sphinx shrugged his shoulders and Chaosia blushed, chuckling as she shot Sphinx a look. \"Well, we're car people, what can we say? And we have three together so this is actually a really good fit. So,\" she looked back at her brother and Toby then rolled her eyes, \"What about the bedrooms?\" Chaosia followed Margaret back through the mud hall and kitchen into the huge great room. She loved this house so far . . . and she could tell that the garage had sweetened the deal for not only Sphinx but Mikhail and Atley as well. She now had allies if he tried to pull too big of a fit. She stopped, listening to Margaret as she continued with the tour. \"To the right of the great room is a master bedroom suite, with a large bathroom and his-and-her walk–in closets big enough for a Hilton wardrobe.\" Chaosia followed her, awed at the huge French doors leading out onto a private second veranda with ivy covered railing. The room itself was massive, painted the same pretty taupe as the rest of the house, big enough to fit both of their beds with clearance on either side. She smirked, shooting a quick glance to Sphinx. Maybe this will make him want to part with their old furniture and get new . . . \"The roomy master bath features the same eco-friendly stone tile as the other bathrooms, though this one a definite perk. There are his-and-her vanities, a large whirlpool tub and a freestanding shower identical to the other.\" Chaosia smiled, seeing the tub was big enough for the two of them . . . if they ever spoke again then that might be a good idea for a rainy day . . . \"On the other side of the great room are two more bedrooms, which both open to a private full bath, the same as this one, minus the shower. All of the rooms in this home have high ceilings. In addition to the vaulted rooms mentioned above: the master bedroom has a 14'-6\" ceiling while bedrooms 2 and 3 have 13' ceilings, as does the kitchen; and the foyer has a 14'-2\" ceiling. This adds dimension and space to the 3151 sq ft floor plan. The bonus room, over the garage adds an additional 536 square feet.\" Chaosia smiled, taking in all of the information as she watched Sphinx do the same. They both liked this house, though she wasn't foolish enough to think that he didn't have his reservations about it. One thing it had going for it was the proximity to both the Coroner's Office and the garage . . . seeing as in the 6,987 sq ft lot sat on the corner of E Shaw and Quincy Ave it put the house about a ten minute drive from the Office and 15 from the garage . . . shaving at least ten of his travel for work and nearly fifteen for his . . . . hobby. \"Well, I'll leave you two to talk about this . . . but just to let you know, I have another appointment to show this beauty today in about an hour . . .\" Sphinx nodded as Chaosia turned and said, \"Thanks, Margaret. We'll just be a few minutes.\" As the blonde left the room, Sphinx saw Chaosia turn and look to him with pleasing puppy dog eyes. He groaned. The house was on the upper end of the price range he'd given the realtor before . . . actually a few thousand above it . . . but nothing that couldn't be handled with some creative restructuring and arranging. He even had an idea how to get the already decent price lowered enough to take care of the issue . . . If she wanted it so badly she'd have it . . . but she was not paying for half of it . . . He opened his mouth to speak when she cut him off. \"Look, if you can really do this without wiping out everything you've worked to accumulate then fine . . . be a dick and don't let me help buy our house. But if you don't let me help with purchasing the house, then I get to donate every stitch of both of our furniture and furnish the entire house. No questions and no exceptions. That's the only option you get. Take it or leave it.\" Sphinx stopped, floored. He was going to let her do whatever she wanted with the bloody house anyway . . . \"Sure, girlie. If that's the way you want it . . . Is this what you want? You've been dancing around this place like a kid with candy.\" She turned, an unnerving gleam in her eye as she smiled at him. \"Yep. I mean, seriously, this house is so us. And it's even dark on the outside so you don't have to paint it!\" Sphinx rolled his eyes, turning to go tell the woman to cancel the other appointment. If all went well, they could start the sell legalities later in the week and close before February . . . It would be a great birthday present for Chaosia if he had her moved into the house when she got back from her mini-trip to London for her twenty-sixth birthday in a few weeks . . . Atley smirked at the blushing agent as she gushed over the fact that she just knew Chaosia was interested in the house. He knew the girl was in love with the place, no one in their right mind would be anything but . . . . but it worried him about the price. He'd snuck a covert glance at the pricing for the Colonial monster and felt his heart stop. The original price had been well over a million dollars . . . and the reduced price was right at $925,000. Which would make the mortgage huge . . . He turned, noticing Sphinx step into the kitchen and come to stand beside the still gushing agent. \"We'll take it. How much do they need down?\" Atley stopped, knowing by the halt in conversation in the great room that Toby and Mikhail were both as shocked as he was. Margaret, however, just seemed nonplussed, pulling a contract and her phone out of her bag and setting to work on figuring out what they needed to start negotiating the contract to close. Sphinx quickly took the contract, looking it over before scribbling something out in the margin and handing it back to her. Atley looked at Sphinx, brow raised in question. Sphinx however just shrugged. Finally, when the woman walked outside to call the owners Atley had to speak. \"Are you sure about this? I mean, is she going to help or are you going to kill yourself to prove you could do what she wanted?\" Sphinx glared at him. \"I've got more than enough to cover this, Jackson. I do work atop other things. And my apartment had been paid for ten years now. Savings wise, I've got enough to do all but few grand . . . the rest I can pull from stock and CDs if need be.\" Atley stood there, amazed as he heard what had spilled from Sphinx's lips. He had enough to do this? And he still worked and boosted? Why? \"Then what the fuck do you- why do you-Damn it man, I want answers.\" Sphinx shrugged again. \"I've always invested, Atley. And I've almost always had two sources of income . . . even before I got my Doctorate.\" \"Doctorate?\" Both heads turned to See Mikhail and Toby, obviously shocked. Sphinx nodded slowly. \"You? A freaking doctor? Since when?\" Sphinx glared at the two of them, the settled his attention back on Atley, answering the question. \"Since I graduated from grad school. What'd you lot think I did at the morgue?\" The trio shared a look, stunned as they admitted, almost at the same time, \"Never really thought about it.\" \"Uh, I really didn't want to know.\" \"I didn't care so long as you could take care of Chaos.\" Chaosia chose that moment to walk in, smiling as she slid her phone into her pocket. She crossed the space, leaning up to kiss Sphinx full on the lips, unrepentant about exposing the others to the display of affection. Mikhail, however, turned and looked at his sister and his features darkened. \"Did you know what he does for a living?\" Chaosia stopped, turning to look at Mikhail like he was crazy. \"What?\" \"Did you know he was a freaking doctor?\" She nodded slowly, oblivious to the issue. \"Uh, yeah . . . a pathologist is a doctor, Mikhail . . . and Sphinx is always updating his forensic certification with continuing education . . . why? What's wrong? Guys?\" Atley looked at Sphinx, hurt and angry as Mikhail just looked lost. Toby however nudged both of them, shaking his head. Chaosia just looked between them, her happiness at finding their future home dissipating at the new tension in the air. She leaned into Sphinx, looking up at him as he continued to glare at the others while he looped his arm over her shoulders and pulled her close to him. Atley suddenly knew from the new darkness that crept into his friend's eyes that they were all in trouble for spoiling Chaosia's fun . . . in a very big way . Finally, Margaret came back in, handing him a contract to sign with a huge smile on her face. \"They agreed to your terms. They're eager to move the property and said that it wouldn't be any issue at all. And at the price you quoted. So, as soon as I get back, I can start filing this and we can get this going.\" Sphinx nodded, pointedly ignoring the four sets of eyes on him. He stepped away from Chaos, rubbing her arm as he did so, going to sign the last piece of paper and take the key from her. He was glad he'd thought to offer to pay for the thing in cash. He knew the audit that would come later in the year would be hellacious but it would be worth it. Besides, he knew the benefits would outweigh the cons. He had a legal out for every penny he was spending today, and now he would have enough left over to justify until his spending until his next check . . . and they never found his other stashes so it was all good. With Chaosia doing all of the furnishing this worked out well. And legally for once. He signed, hating the way his legal name looked on the contract . . . but he knew it would have to do. Besides, only the agent and Chaosia would ever know it . . . so it really shouldn't bother him so severely. He turned, smirking to Chaosia as she came to glance it over, nodding at the changes and the time frame. She started talking to him quietly, keeping the conversation between them and leaving the others in the dark. Even though they were trying to eavesdrop. That was one of the reasons he loved this girl . \"Smart move . . . but why so quickly? We have months before we get married . . .\" He shrugged, keeping his plans to himself. \"Why wait? Better to have it and be working slowly than rush with everything else you'll be doing. Besides . . . It's what you want. Consider it your wedding present.\" She stopped, looking up at him, smiling. Stretching to her tiptoes, she pressed a kiss to his cheek. \"You didn't have to buy me a house, you know. I'm getting everything I need with you.\" He shrugged, handing the contract back to the smiling agent. \"I wanted to . . . which is why you weren't going to put in for it. This is my gift to you.\" She nodded, some of her irritation from the tension between him and the others draining away as she grinned at him. \"Then prepare for a few presents of your own. No questions and no exceptions. And no bitching. Deal?\" He nodded, waiting until she looked thoroughly pleased with herself to kiss her silly. Chaosia had insisted that the men all ride together in the Escalade while she drove the Malibu to the Anchor to tell Sway the news and grab her to show her the house. The key had been part of Sphinx's terms apparently and she was going to let them fight whatever out amongst them and get it over with . . . So she was going to kidnap Sway. She smiled, flying down Santa Fe Ave as she listened to the Malibu's engine. She would have Otto look it over tomorrow, feigning some catastrophe with the Chevelle . . . and offer to let Sphinx take the Aston. He never could turn down the cherry red beauty . . . even for his Baby Blue. And then she would have him and Memphis do an overhaul on the engine and systems. She knew that the Malibu didn't need it but it wouldn't hurt her to do it . . . and it would be the perfect excuse to put the new exhaust on that she'd ordered for Sphinx weeks ago. He would probably kill her but it would be a real treat to see the nice shining chrome against the blue. As she turned in, she spotted Sway's bike . . . and Eleanor . Well, the more the merrier. Later, peeps. On to work.[Chapter 31] I'm not DEAD! WHAAAAA! But i am still fighting with the computer and stuff so . . . I just wanted to throw out this good will gesture and let everyone know that yes, i am still alive. Yes i am still very interested in these stories and I do fully intend to finish them. i even have an outline for a sequel to Coffee . . . but first I have to be able to get back to posting regularly. And by the way, thank you to all the readers who reviewed and faved . Its been awesome to see that people are still reading these even though i havent been able to update like I wanted. But that's all going to change my lovelies. Oh and Inferno . . . you freaking rock. I am so glad you're back! Okay. Enough stupid crap. on with the show! A Little More Understanding Memphis stood in the middle of the living room of Chaosia and Sphinx's new house, still amazed at the huge windows and the tips of the chandelier from the breakfast nook. Sway was ecstatic for her friend, talking and planning as they practically raced from room to room. Memphis chuckled, going to sit on the counter as he heard Chaosia start talking about paint colors and Sway volunteering all of them for paint detail. The two would start the huge redecoration tomorrow, Chaosia not disclosing to anyone exactly how much she had allotted for the project other than she would have her way or no way at all . . . A sentiment Sway agreed with full heartedly. God why did they have to get along so damned well? He'd talked to Atley earlier and though he could understand the hurt feelings that Sphinx never told them about the exact position he held, he was with Toby on how it didn't really matter. If anything it made the man even more fearsome. To be such a proficient boost on top of keeping a job like that . . . and not getting caught. It meant he was freaking brilliant and very good at juggling the two worlds . . . that were about to sprout a third. He sighed, watching the two shoot past him and down the hallway to the steps for the bonus room. He knew Chaosia was upset with Mikhail and Atley for the way they were still snubbing her future husband . . . but having Sway to run around with was improving her soured mood. The girl had turned out to be fiercely protective of the large boost, to the point that she rivaled his actions over her. He shook his head. The two of them really were perfect for each other . . . God in heaven help them when they had kids . . . he shuddered, suddenly overcome with an image of little boys with Sphinx's disposition and Chaosia's coloring . . . and both of their tempers. He shook himself. That was a nightmare waiting to happen . . . but then again he was sure the rest of the crew (save Chaosia and Kip) thought that little Sways and Memphis clones were probably on the same page. \"Memphis!\" He turned, startled to see Sway right beside him. He raised a brow at his girlfriend. \"Where's your partner-in-crime?\" She smirked, sliding onto the glistening granite kitchen counter beside him, laying her head on his shoulder as she talked. \"Oh, she went to let Paul in when he comes . . . So can you believe this? Sphinx is getting married and they're gonna live here . . .\" Memphis shrugged. \"It's the way of things, Sway.\" He kissed her hair before continuing. \"You meet someone, fall in love and try not to kill each other while you get married and have kids . . . even crazy people like us aren't immune to that particular desire . . . Not even the Sphinx.\" \"OH MY GOD! You HATERFUL whore! Why didn't you tell me you were house hunting? And to pick this? That's it, I won't forgive you unless I have my own room, Calamity I swear it.\" Sway cackled as Paul stalked into the room, hands on his hips as he stopped and glared at the still smiling Chaosia. She looped her arms through one of his, smiling up at him. \"Nope. But you can help me make the bonus room if you want to.\" His scowl instantly vanished and he nodded, sticking a hand out for her to shake. \"Deal.\" Memphis groaned as Sway and Chaosia laughed. Poor Sphinx didn't have a prayer. Time to start the wedding and decorating planning! Oh fuck . . .[Chapter 32] Okay. Here is a little treat for all of my loyal readers-and new ones too, no need to worry- and a good will gesture to show i am really back to regular updates. Making Home Sphinx's hands roamed Chaosia's back, dipping every now and again to touch lightly over her ass as he kissed her. He'd come back to the new house-their house-after he'd hashed everything out with Atley . . . to find Chaos sitting in the floor of their master bedroom and pouring over a million design books, sticking post-it flags here and there as she tried to find exactly what she wanted. Paul, Memphis and Sway were all long gone apparently . . . and she had gone by the house to change before coming back. So now, instead of the fitted brown suit and blue and white shirt . . . she was sitting there in nothing but a pair of her charcoal work out shorts and a very tight fitting black tank top. Her hair was pulled into a loose knot and hanging over one shoulder while she flipped pages, curling wildly with a life of its own. Sphinx had shed his coat and stepped out of his shoes quickly, not bothering to kick them to the side as he made his way to her. She'd looked up, eyes wide as she realized she was no longer alone and had reached for her track jacket . . . but he'd caught her, pulling her up and flush against him before she could hide herself in the coat. He'd savored the flash of sheer heat that passed through her eyes before he'd slashed his mouth against hers, literally picking her off the floor. Her legs wrapped around his waist as knelt, still holding her, and lowered both of them to the floor. Careful of her books and papers, he began to work towards leaving her thoroughly sated . . . his mouth trailing down her neck and onwards to her chest. He would never admit it, but it was beyond nice to get to undress his future wife in their bedroom. Even if it didn't have a bed yet . . . With one deft flick of his wrist, Chaosia's shirt was gone, bearing her black lace clad chest to him as his other hand started tugging her shorts off. She very quickly got the message, her hands pushing his suspenders off of his shoulders and down before she started fumbling with the clasp to his jeans. He sat up, pulling his own shirt over his head before helping her with the jeans, standing long enough to kick them and the black boxers away. As soon as he was back on his knees, Chaosia was up, arms around his neck as she kissed him . . . but he gently pushed her back down and onto her back before he started lavishing her with every bit of attention he possibly could. And savoring each and every little noise she made. By God the lads might've messed up her fun with their stupidity earlier but he would damn sure insure that she would love this house . . . and would remember him buying it as a good thing. Even if it took him all night to accomplish it. Later, Chaosia laid spread across Sphinx's chest, the peacoat she'd gotten him for Christmas draped over them as a makeshift blanket. She sighed, snuggling into him as he rubbed her back lazily. She had no clue where that had come from but she really hoped it would pop up again. She loved it when he did things like this. Just randomly couldn't keep his hands off of her or wait to get home . . . Well, actually she guessed he did wait to get her home . . . She giggled to herself, shaking her head. \"And what's all the giggling about then?\" She looked up, propping her chin on his chest as he pushed himself up on one elbow. She kissed over his heart, smiling into his flesh as she answered him. \"I was just thinking that you couldn't wait to get me home . . . and then I remembered that this is home now. Or it will be soon . . .\" He chuckled and she loved the sound. It wasn't like his normal dark little chortles or the mean spirited laugh she caught on occasion. He was happy. Truly and sincerely happy. And she loved it. She sat up, moving slowly as she stretched before she sat in his lap, wrapping her arms around his shoulders as he sat up and pulled her tighter against him. She smiled, leaning in and pressing her forehead to his as his hands started to travel to her hips and back up her sides, causing her to shiver. The dark chuckle that followed promised nothing but sinful bliss and sheer debauchery if she stayed where she was . . . which was fine by her. She leaned in, pressing her lips to the corner of his mouth. \"I love you, Sphinx . . . I really, really do. And I love our home . . . . the home you got me.\" His mouth hit hers hard, moving furiously against her own as he tried to devour her from the mouth down. She had no clue what she'd just said to flip his switch but she was definitely going to find out . . . and log the tidbit away for future reference. But right this second she had much bigger things to attend to . . . Okay . . . yeah . . .[Chapter 33] Okay. So I've started writing for another category and I swear it is about to eat me alive. The Sons of Anarchy story Hit Me With Your Best Shot is my newest brainchild . . . an I was asked, nay begged to put Chaosia there . . .Well, long story short its eating my brain but I was lucky to get some good ol' fashioned Sphinx in here instead of the twisted and demented (but still oh so hot) Tig . On that note, I am encountering a lot of weirdness with that story . . . from email complaints to awkward discussions. I so totally miss the love i get here with the Coffee Verse . . . i may justs tay here permanently . . . Anyway, Infeno I am so glad i continue to make you day and yes Midnightshadow07 it is very easy to love Sphinx . . . if you can get him to talk ;) Thanks for the support and the reviews. They mean the world to me . . . and without further aideu here we go . . . Falling into Place Chaosia sighed as she surveyed her now packed apartment one last time, trying to fight off the wave of nostalgia that was steadily setting in. She knew that she had to do this . . . that packing up the loft had been one of the few things she'd had left to do before leaving for London . . . but it didn't make the reality of the organized boxes any easier to deal with. She reached out, tracing the outline of a cardboard container almost reverently before turning to exit through the fire escape and go back up to Sphinx's flat. The apartment that would be home for the next few months until all of the renovations were done on their new home. But it still didn't make leaving the place she'd worked so hard to make home any easier . . . She reached over and cut out the lights, closing the door behind her as she stepped out onto the patio. She kept her eyes down as she turned to go back upstairs, only to run right into a solid wall of warm muscle. She jumped, dropping her keys as she looked up and into the eyes of her fiancé. Correction: the worried eyes of her fiancé. She sighed, smiling weakly up to him before she went to speak . . . but his lips cut her off, slanting over hers as he pulled her into him. She couldn't help herself as she melted into his touch, letting everything plaguing her fade away as his mouth moved over hers. She had no clue what had sparked this new romantic side to her lover but she was not going to bitch or complain about it. If anything, she wished she could've figured it out earlier . . . or now for that matter . . . Eventually, he pulled back, pressing his lips against her forehead as he held her, rubbing her shoulders as she shivered and snuggled deeper into his chest. \"You were supposed to wait on me, Love . . . not do this by yourself.\" She shrugged in his hold, pressing her cheek against his chest and just enjoying listening to his heart as he held her. She knew he was upset with her for doing this on her own but it was something she'd had to do . . . She'd packed up her parents' house after her mother's death, putting pretty much every piece of material thing that held any connection to her Mom into boxes and storage or donating it. She'd helped clean her father's home after the brutal attack against her, scrubbing her own blood off the walls and tile floor while her father and brother were off in their own worlds of denial. And had packed her own apartments at both colleges. She could handle packing up this one too . . . she just hadn't planned on doing it so soon . . . \"I was fine Sphinx . . . I just had to get this done . . . Besides, someone had to be here while they picked up the furniture to take to Goodwill, right?\" Sphinx just shook his head, pulling her tighter against him as he let out a long suffering sigh. God his girl was stubborn but he loved her for it. She had probably just saved him at least a few days of heartache while she was across the Pond Monday . . . Now he just hoped that she'd come back to him in one piece. Mentally anyway. She had already been spending a few hours a day on the phone with Selene and Guadimus, trying to convince them to wait until April to set up shop here in the States. He cringed, tugging her tighter against him. God he hoped she won that particular fight. Because while he and her father got along pretty well-considering he'd been screwing the man's daughter since late October and royally fucked things up in late November-he knew that keeping their exposure to one another limited is what kept them on such a good level playing ground. And Selene . . . the woman had come a long way since she and Chaosia had hashed out their issues . . . but he still didn't like to be forced in her company for too long if he could help it. She was behaving as well as could be expected during their Christmas holiday but he knew not to hold his breath that said good behavior could survive a whole month and half . . . he just prayed his future wife could handle the stress. And that she would let him dispose of anyone too stupid to behave. Like her new jackass of a stepbrother-in-law. He leaned down, kissing the crown of her dark curls before turning and ushering her upstairs. They had a big day ahead of them tomorrow . . . and she didn't even know it yet. The wallpaper company had called him earlier and sworn that everything she'd ordered was in now-just three weeks too late to be of any fucking use if you asked him-and that someone would be able to install all of it tomorrow. He shook his head, squeezing her to him as they ascended the steps to his-no their home. It was still odd to think that they'd be sharing the apartment until she left for London . . . He was really just getting used to her being in it all of the time and now they were moving into a damn monster of a house . . . He smirked, reaching out and opening the door for her, pushing her into the warm apartment and out of the relatively cool February night air . . . and loved to see her shed the peacoat he'd gotten her and reveal what she was wearing underneath. She'd gone to an early interview with the Jeffersonian Institute's Forensic Department earlier today and he had to say she still looked amazing. It was no wonder they'd practically offered her the reconstructionist position after she graduated . . .The black menstyled trousers set low on her hips and showed of the figure she'd been toning in the gym with Sway and Paul-swearing that now that it was her off season for soccer she needed something to stay in shape for the wedding- while the fitted long sleeved slate blue shirt seemed normal from the back . . . until she turned and raised a brow at him. The front had a moderate V neck with a criss-cross wrap that practically molded to her breasts, the black lace camisole beneath the shirt keeping it from being too risqué . . . and made it even that much more alluring. She was wearing her rings and her necklace he'd gotten her, the diamonds glittering even in the low light as she tossed her coat onto the couch and crossed back to him. Sphinx grinned, dipping so she could wrap her arms around his shoulders without having to stretch too far. He knew if any of the others saw them right now there would be hell to pay . . . but the closer they got to their impending nuptials the more excited he found himself. He honestly loved Chaosia . . . and he was thrilled that he would be able to stake as much of a claim on her as she had on him. Besides . . . it wasn't like he was completely whipped or anything . . . he'd even been able to put up a four hour fight over the damn bridesmaids and groomsmen choices. Before she'd decided to fight dirty and started stripping a piece of clothing everytime he'd agree to her choices. He shook himself mentally as his lips met hers. She really was creative when it came to getting her way . . . and the white satin lingerie set with black lace detailing and the tiny little garter belt holding up the classic black lace trimmed stockings with the piping down the back had been a very inventive weapon . . . By the time he'd gotten to the garter belt he would've agreed to let Mickey Mouse be their pastor if it meant he could've started sliding those stockings down her long legs and working on getting her out of the bra and cheeky panties. As it happens he'd agreed to have Atley as a best man with Memphis, Khail, Donnie and Toby as groomsmen while he'd agreed to her choices of Sway, Maetel (another friend from her school he'd met in passing), Monique and her stepsister Jacqueline as bridesmaids . . . and Paul would be standing beside her as the Man of Honor. He'd allowed that knowing: 1. how happy it would make her and 2 how uncomfortable Atley would be walking down the aisle with Paul. He chuckled against her lips, causing her to shudder and lean even further into him before he decided they needed to move this to their bedroom. He needed to get as much use from the bed before she gave it away anyway . . . Chaosia stood in the middle of her new kitchen and swore that if she ever moved again she would just leave it however she found it. The bathrooms were painted and done-already furnished with towels, bath curtains, storage dressers and every accessory known to womankind- while the Media room over the garage was almost there as well. She and Paul had worked on that for the past few days . . . and her favorite partner in domestic crime and decorating had pitched a fit to get it finished before she left tomorrow. She thought it was weird but she'd shrugged and trudged ahead, working to get everything painted and all the wallpaper up and the new light fixtures in place. The new furniture would be ready to deliver Monday but she'd called and told them to hold off until she got back two weeks later. Paul could've moved everything and gotten it situated but she just didn't want to miss out on the actual joy of decorating and organizing her and Sphinx's first home . . . She wanted them to do this together. And while he might not appreciate the sentiment-the emotionally retarded oaf-she sure as hell would enjoy watching him move around the furniture. Hey, everyone has guilty pleasures and if hers was watching her future husband move heavy objects shirtless around their new home then so be it. She had more than earned that little treat. She sighed, turning to go back up to the Media Room. The furniture for in there was already set . . . and she knew that her home would forever be the hangout after the crew saw what she and Paul had accomplished. She'd painted the once white walls a deep charcoal, pinstriping the longest bare wall with tiny black and metallic white stripes while the other got a full built in cabinetry treatment around the river stone fireplace. A 72\" flatscreen TV and Blu Ray combo was mounted above the mantle, allowing the screen to be seen from anywhere in the room. A huge stone gray U shaped suede sectional couch took up the area directly in front of the TV, a plethora of red white black gray and navy pillows crowning the seats while an antique ebony wood and red felt billiard table sat behind it, positioned to where the open bar she'd had installed. The nook housed a shelving unit that boasted separate wine and beer coolers as well as four rows of liquor and alcohol . . . completely stocked and looking every bit as professional as any barkeep had ever seen. Sway had been awed and sworn to break it in after their move . . . The walls were adorned with framed pieces of Chaosia's artwork and photography, a huge ink and charcoal piece of Otto's hanging directly behind the pool table. Two black leather reclining armchairs sat across from the couch while four barstools were pushed beneath the counter. The cleverly hidden surround sound and the huge black leather ottoman acting as a coffee table completed the space . . . Well, that and the two airbrushed paintings of the twin Malibus hanging on either side of the picture window, both looking like they were dripping ink. One red and one blue . . . She sighed, nodding as she reached out to cut off the lights and go to leave. She'd been here most of the day . . . and she just wanted to go home, eat and cuddle up with her hubby-to-be before she had to go to sleep. She had to be at the airport by seven and on the plane by nine. And she was dreading it . . . The crowds, the lines and the security hassles and that wasn't even beginning to cover the withdraws she was sure to face after her two weeks abroad and away from her Sphinx . . . . Too bad she couldn't tuck her lover in her carry on and sneak him to London. Not that he would ever fit . . . or ever go for it . . . She sighed, going towards the front door with a sad grin. Oh well. She could dream after all . . . Okay. one more minichapter then im hitting the hay. It almost 3 am and no sleep is not good for my brain . . . what's left of it anyway . . .[Chapter 34] Inspecting the Surprizes Sphinx surveyed the house, nodding as he went from room to room. The guest rooms were set up as well as the room they'd slotted for the office and library, the built-in bookcases already together and lined with both books and baskets of Chaosia's arts supplies. The new lighted wooden desk was in place in front of the window, the new curtains and sheers helping to soften the light flowing into the large room. Two large white armchairs sat against the other wall, a good sized mirrored table between them holding a flower arrangement Paul had put together and a serving tray to catch their books and papers. Two wall sconce lamps were mounted on the far side of either chair, each controlled by a separate switch for convenience. The computer was tucked away on the desk, only the monitor visible and displaying a slide show of Chaosia's photography. A huge cream and charcoal swirled rug grounded the space, the row of mirrored picture frames holding the black and white photos of both of their cars in different angles and lighting helping to refract some of the lamp light to make the room seem brighter. And the pearlescent pewter and titanium striped wallpaper shimmer. He walked out and into the still almond living room, nodding at the two over sized plush distressed and aged black leather couches with silver brad detailing and the multitude of different colored and textured pillows. Chaosia's trinkets and maps were displayed throughout the room, a large world map stretched over the fireplace in a shining shell frame. The huge driftwood coffee table sat in the middle, housing the controls to the TV-cleverly hidden behind the map- and entertainment system while the shelves to the side housed their massive music and movie collection. Another printed rug, this time sporting black and white with red and turquoise accents, held the room centered. And the faded turquoise suede overstuffed armchairs angled on the far end of the couches allowed for people to sit and move freely without being too far away to talk. Or stare in his case. The dining room now had a completely different look than when they first got it . . . The walls were covered in an iridescent platinum wall paper with a tiny white, black and teal pattern, the window seals painted a high gloss white while the wooden barrel ceiling gleamed like the hardwood floors, the latter partially covered by the plush white rug beneath the long farmhouse table. Said table was lined with four white leather chairs on either side, each sporting a sparkling silver accent pillow while the two end chairs were out of this world. Bright turquoise armchairs with silver brad details and throw pillows with a vibrant multicolored print to match the various pieces of art hanging on the walls. The lapis chandelier hung low over the table, casting a warm glow over the white, silver, black and turquoise place settings. Over all the room was no where near as girly as he'd expected, the two shades of blue green going well together . . . and this was by far the brightest space so he could deal with it. The kitchen was pretty much the same as before, save being painted a soothing deep pewter that offset the dark mahogany cabinetry well. Pictures and pieces of art and car memorabilia lined the longest wall, which was decked in a cream and pewter wall paper, while a small wooden table with two plush arm chairs acted as a dinette set was nestled against it. And he found himself looking forward to eating breakfast and dinner there with his wife . . . He shook his head, moving on and towards their master bedroom. No need to get all mushy and sentimental when the girl wasn't even here yet . . . her plane landed in two hours and he needed to check everything before he left. Paul had hijacked her plans and sketches and Sway had made the call to get the furniture shipped early, allowing the now reconciled crew to get to work on Chaosia's birthday present . . . . And while he thought it was good, he needed to make sure it was perfect. Because after today they were living here now. He'd cleaned out the loft with Atley and Mikhail, letting both of them practically pick his apartment clean before handing over his keys and signing the papers to put the place up for sale. The realtor had called and congratulated them on the quick sell of Chaosia's unit . . . but with the improvements and additions the girl had made it wasn't a wonder as to how quickly it had gone. And while he had a few renovations invested himself, he wasn't in any huge hurry to let go of the place. He just didn't need the hassle of the other place now that the house was ready. He stepped into the master suite and new that he and Chaosia wouldn't be leaving that bed for the rest of the night and tomorrow if he had his way. His girl had done a damn fine job of replacing their furniture and picking something they could both enjoy. The tall ebony wood Cali King canopy bed came to his waist after the mattress and toppers, complete with flowing white sheers hanging all around it, shielding the main bed from view with long billowing white and cream fabric. The plush cream sheets and faded charcoal and dusky lavender crushed velvet duvet made it seem darker, especially against the dark taupe walls with the turned down shimmering silver and plum comforter. What seemed like a thousand pillows crowned the head of the bed, still leaving plenty of room to stretch out and lay down. The windows were covered in cream sheers, breaking up the dark color. Silver framed pictures and mirrors were placed on the far wall, a mirrored dresser beneath them, as well as antiqued mirrored side tables with black detailing. A small black tray held the remote control atop it beside the large silver and black lamp and the framed picture of them together from Sway. He looked around, only seeing the white armoire the glittering dresser and the doorway to the master bathroom. His table held an old fashioned silver alarm clock and a similar arrangement to the one downstairs and the dog eared vintage car book Otto had gotten her for Christmas that he had commandeered as his own. A black leather bench sat at the foot of the bed, more blankets folded for when she got home . . . He sighed, nodding before going to leave. He just hoped she appreciated what they'd done for her . . . and that she wouldn't freak too badly over the fact that he'd been drving the Aston the entire time she'd been gone . . . Like i said . . . minichapter and just a quick view of the house. Isn't he just too fucking sweet to do all of that while she's gone? I mean seriously . . . tall, dark, handsome, dangerous and a hidden sweet side . . . where do they pass these guys out in real life again? Okay kiddies. Bedtime for ol' chaosia . . . goodnight.[Chapter 35] Chaosia groused as she shifted in her seat, trying not to glare at the hateful flight attendant that had been making her fourteen hour flight seem like an eternity in the lowest rung of Hell. The woman had gone out of her way to not only ignore her requests for another blanket (and a Jack and coke after the crying toddler behind her tried to toss himself over the seats and into her lap for the seventh time in twenty minutes) but she'd been damn rude every time she had to even pass by her. She so should've let her father and Selene upgrade her ticket to First Class like they wanted but oh no . . . She had to insist that the down grade to Coach was fine so long as she got to catch her original red eye back to the States . . . Chaosia sighed, glancing at her watch and groaning. She still had another five hours on this flight and then a two hour lay-over in New York . . . before her flight across the Continental US to LAX. And as soon as her feet touched the ground she had to grab a shower, change into something semi-presentable and then go and cuss the wallpaper distributer for everything the stupid bitch was worth. She'd called before lifting off from London to check the progress of her order and when they were meeting her tomorrow. For the woman to tell her-in a very exasperated tone-that not only had the order already been filled and shipped but that it had already been installed and signed off on before hanging up on her. She scowled then went deathly still as she felt the same little feet connect with the back of her seat. Again. She turned, glaring at the child-who really was too fucking cute for his own good- before turning her gaze to the mother. Who was still sleeping with sleep mask and ear buds firmly in place, completely ignoring her very small very active son. Said little boy looked up at her with big grey-green eyes and smiled, waving his chocolate covered fingers at her before turning and laying his hands right on his mother's cream pantsuit leg. Now Chaos knew that it was a horrible thing to do but she couldn't help the laugh that bubbled from her lips as the little hellion began patting his mother's knee, leaving dirty brown smears in his wake. And when the unsuspecting and inattentive mother reached out and patted his hand on her leg, she had to bite her tongue when she came away just as dirty as her child . . . and left a huge brown smear right beneath her nose when she wiped her face. The little boy turned back to Chaosia and grinned, pointing to the mess he'd made with pride. He leaned up, speaking excitedly as she tried to keep herself just out of his reach. The mess those grubby little fingers had made was hilarious . . . so long as it stayed on the other side of her seat. \"Guess what!\" She smiled patiently to him, speaking lowly enough to not wake his mother or alert the flight attendants. No need bringing the hateful cow back over here to be a bigger bitch than she already had been. \"What sweetheart?\" He grinned, blushing brightly as he leaned closer. And Chaosia knew that even after his parents got him clean this kid was going to reek of chocolate for weeks. He even had it in his ears and up his nose from what she could tell . . . \"I'm gonna be an artist when I'm all growed up . . . I'm already practicing' . . . See!\" She nodded, looking over the ruined suit and seats with mirth. She so knew the hell her own parents had gone through when her more artistic tendencies started to manifest. And this boy was apparently going to rival even her. \"I see that . . . I bet you're going to be really good . . .\" He grinned even brighter before he turned and grabbed his stuffed bunny- the heathered gray jersey rabbit was a bit worse for wear and sporting almost as much chocolate as he was- and started chattering aloud to the toy. Chaosia smiled, shaking her head and settling back into her seat. Maybe now, since she'd spoken to him he wouldn't kick her seat again . . . and maybe when she hit the page button the damn bitch would actually get her a damn drink . . . She hit the button and another attendant was there quickly, nodding as he went to go get her what he guaranteed would be a very strong Jack and Coke on the rocks. A few moments later she was reclined ever so slightly, drink in hand and counting down the minutes-only two hundred and sixty to go- before they landed. She might even be able to grab some things in New York before she had to reboard . . . maybe get Sphinx a nice new hatchet to help her dismember the snotty wallpaper receptionist and the damn aggravating flight attendant . . . but she might just try to sleep . . . And she was almost there, eyes closed with the half finished drink on the tray in front of her when the sudden shriek behind her, followed by the high pitched laughter and the sharp kick to the back of her seat brought her crashing back into full consciousness . . . and said drink emptied into her lap right as her new 'friend' climbed over the back of the seat and laid a chocolately hand on the shoulder of her pale pink fitted tuxedo shirt and bone gray vest. She sighed, head falling back against the seat as her eyes closed. She hated fucking flying coach . . . Atley Jackson watched-more than slightly amused- as the mass of travelers and workers crawling through LAX moved quickly and with purpose . . . making sure to not come too close to the brooding and growling boost glaring at the malfunctioning Arrivals board. He took in a shallow breath, trying to fight the urge to laugh as Memphis and Toby worked to keep their distance from both the crowds and the Sphinx . . . though the farther they ventured from the positively terrifying man the more they had to work to not get trampled by the bustling crowds. It amazed Atley at times that Sphinx was ever able to tolerate larger groups of people at all . . . and though he'd mellowed considerably since he'd taken up with the quirky little artist that had doused his grouchy ass with coffee in October; he knew how much this was grating on the stoic man's already nonexistent nerves . . . but damnation if it wasn't fun to watch. It seemed that-save for them- the entire population of the airport was keeping a safe distance of at least a twenty foot radius . . . and he was sure that the next person stupid enough to step into that zone was going to grace the slabs in the morgue . . . And while the towering pathologist's waning resolve-evidenced by the throbbing vein right over his left eye-was at the forefront of entertainment, Memphis's antics were probably running a very close second. He and Sway were still fighting over when their own wedding would take place and-in addition to trying to not get trampled to death by the heavy traffic of bodies and not get throttled by stepping on Sphinx's shoes (for the third time)-he was speaking very quickly into the phone, trying to placate his own fiancé while they waited on Chaosia. Poor Toby just kept to himself and tried to not get stepped on as he glanced between the moving platforms and the blinking screens that kept switching between outdated arrival times and static . . . and the way his fingers kept twitching told Atley that he was probably only a few second away from trying to fix whatever glitch was causing the issue. Atley shook his head, watching Toby scan the newly disembarked passengers again; trying to find the girl they were waiting on. The shy boy had started to blossom in front of them in the few months that Kip and Tumbler had insisted on teaching him to boost . . . and had become a powerful runner in his own right when Sphinx stepped in as a sponsor. What had begun as a way to keep the boy from suffering through the antics of the two showboating thieves-and reaping whatever consequences their poor teaching skills would eventually lead to- had transformed into something none of them had ever guessed possible. Toby loved to learn, had a thirst for knowledge that he'd never seen before, and Sphinx wasn't averse to teaching the quiet shy boy the more practical side of their craft. Actually, in the weeks that Chaosia had been away what time Sphinx hadn't devoted to either work or finishing the massive house he'd bought for them, he knew he'd helped Toby refine some of the harder tricks of the trade and shadowing him on small boosts. Just like he knew that Toby had helped set up a good portion of the electronic and technological additions that had needed to be finished-and the network between their computers and laptops he'd set up in their office and bedroom . . . If he were the jealous type then he would be upset at the time his friend was spending with the younger boost . . . until he remembered that Chaosia was probably the larger force behind it. She adored Toby, even going as far as to rearrange most of her own wedding party to ensure that she could make Toby a groomsman if Sphinx wanted-and even if he didn't, Atley was sure- and always went out of her way to be kind to the painfully awkward kid. Besides, she still liked him best of the other members of the Old School so as long as he kept that then he knew he was fine . . . Sphinx turned abruptly, pulling his cell from his coat pocket and pressing it to his ear, not bothering to answer. Atley sighed, shaking his head as he watched Sphinx scan the crowd closely while he listened to what he could guess was Chaos. Seriously, would it kill him to speak to the damn girl? He knew that they talked . . . had caught them carrying on quiet conversations around Otto's when she'd dip in to visit or in their apartments . . . or when they'd bought the damn house. Why did he insist on not speaking now that he had an audience? Memphis seemed to pick the thoughts right out of his brain, pulling away from his own phone call long enough to taunt their friend. As he made sure to keep Toby and Atley between himself and the now glaring man. \"You do know you'll have to talk at the wedding, right? Say 'I do' really loud for the rest of us to bear witness to . . .\" Sphinx glowered at their fearless leader-who was oh-so-bravely inching further and further away from the now evil looking boost-before he turned his attention back to the phone. Atley laughed, shaking his head at Memphis as Toby stood on his tip-toes to try and spot their friend. \"Raines, one day he's going to skin you alive . . . you realize that right?\" Memphis shrugged, grinning as they watched Sphinx roll his eyes and pinch the bridge of his nose, lips moving as he spoke very quietly into the phone. He nodded to their friend and Atley knew it was a good idea that said friend wasn't paying them any attention. \"I swear, that girl's been gone a few weeks and its almost like it was before . . . you know? I almost shit myself when he spoke to Junie and Sway yesterday . . . and I know that Mirror has been avoiding that house like crazy because of the mood he's been in.\" Atley shrugged, nonplussed. He was used to the other man's moods, had been since he'd met him years before, and while he'd noticed that Sphinx was no where near as calm as he had been in recent months he wasn't as bad as Raines was trying to let on. Sphinx had always been secretive and private-though he'd only recently begun to see that even he wasn't excluded from that trait with the reveal of not only his profession but the numerous stock holdings and accounts he'd been hiding from all of them the past ten years- so it really wasn't a shock that without the person who made him be personable that he'd reverted to some of his more . . . close-lipped habits. \"It hasn't been that bad . . . Sway and Toby have been in and out for the past week and they've still got their heads attached . . . and I know Paul has been there a lot. I mean seriously, if anyone was going to feel the wrath of the Sphinx wouldn't it be that guy?\" Memphis was quiet for a few moments while the weight of what Atley said sunk in. There was no way that Sphinx had survived being in and out of that house with just Sway and Paul working on it . . . even Toby and Atley couldn't buffer the two troublemakers enough to keep him from snapping . . . \"Seriously? Paul has been in Sphinx's company unsupervised for more than two minutes at a time and the guy's breathing? What's Chaosia do? Lace every bit of food in their apartment with Lithium before she left?\" Atley shrugged, looking unimpressed by the measure of patience it had taken for them to be having this conversation . . . and for Sway to be alive to keep pestering him. He'd barely been able to handle Sway and Paul together even with Chaosia there as a grounding, neutralizing center. The two nuts without her was enough to give even him nightmares . . . He turned, watching as Sphinx stepped forward just as Chaosia pushed past a very large and angry man-who glared until he spotted the towering maniac waiting on her and vamoosed as quickly as his pudgy legs stuffed into the protesting cowboy boots would carry him- and practically tossed her luggage at Toby's feet before launching herself into the man's chest. Her arms went around him and Memphis was suddenly very aware of just how odd the two of them looked together. Sphinx was in his dark jeans-cuffed at the ankle over his black boots as usual-and a black shirt beneath his gray Member's Only jacket. He wasn't clean shaven like he normally was-something that had thrown all of them for a loop-sporting five o'clock stubble that made him seem even more fearsome. Even as he smirked down at the tiny spritely girl propping her chin against his chest looking up at him. His arms slowly wound around her waist, tugging her tighter as her own wrapped around his shoulders. Chaosia, in her painted on light washed jeans and fitted black long sleeved shirt with a scooped neck that showcased the slender curve of her neck and her shoulders- as well as the glittering keys that she kept around her neck from the moment Sphinx put them there, had her dark curls pulled into a low messy knot at the base of her skull. And her bangs pinned into a fairly high pomp, away from her clean, blushing cheeks . . . . which Sphinx moved a hand up to cup as he dipped to press his lips to hers. Memphis and Toby watched as passer-bys slowed or stopped in the same awe they were caught in at the sight before them . . . before quickly moving on as Atley leveled on of his own infamous glares on the nosey busybodies. Memphis fought the urge to cringe as Toby shivered and turned, grabbing Chaosia's luggage quickly before tossing Memphis a few of the carry-ons. It was very easy to forget that-despite all of his laughs, easy-going jokes and mean-spirited pranks- Atley Jackson had made a name for himself long before most of the other members of the Old School even touched a kit. By being fucking ruthless, cunning and having antifreeze for blood when it came to his crew and scores. A lesson more than a few people in Los Angeles County had just learned the hard way . . . Chaosia sighed, squeezing Sphinx's hand as he drove, navigating the backroads to their house with an ease that told her he'd been familiarizing himself with the quickest routes to and from their new home. He slowed, taking the turn onto Quincy Ave at an appropriate speed-for them anyway- and chuckling when he saw Eleanor slide onto the road behind the Aston a few seconds later. She shook her head, trying not to let him see her smirk when she could see-courtesy of the rearview mirrors- Toby reaching across the front seats to steady the wheel while Memphis tried to fight Atley off. She sighed again, glancing up at him after she regained her composure as they pulled into their driveway. The garage door opened and he parked the Aston, letting her notice that not only was the Malibu here but so was her Chevelle. She looked up to him, brow raised. \"Why are both of the other cars here? Have you seriously been driving the Aston the whole time I've been in London?\" He shrugged, killing the engine and opening his door without ever answering her question. She shook her head, getting out and following him to the side door into the house before she realized that the garage was actually set up. An assortment of tools and gadgets were lining the pegboard above the built in tool benches . . . and she was sure that not all of them were already in her hubby-to-be's possession when she left for London . . . She shrugged, deciding not to fight it as she turned to go inside . . . only to run right into a living wall of hard muscle. She glanced up at him, suddenly weary as he refused to move or open the door . . . while he reached out and hit the button to close off the garage before the others could get in. What in the hell was going on around here? She opened her mouth to speak . . . only to have to remember how to breathe again as his mouth hit hers with such force it made her knees weak. He pulled her flush against him as she wrapped her arms around his shoulders, letting herself melt into the contact she had so desperately missed. A few frenzied moments later, he pulled back and pressed his forehead to hers, drawing in a staggering breath as she gasped for air herself. \"God I've bloody missed you, Girlie . . . \" She grinned, pressing her lips to his softly before rubbing her nose against his. \"I am so glad to hear that . . . I was beginning to wonder if any of you even thought about me at all . . . every time I've talked to any of you, you've all been so busy you could barely talk. I almost decided to stay in London . . . What in the world's been going on that's had all of you so wrapped up in so much?\" His face fell slack, all emotion draining away and she knew that whatever was about to pass through his lips wasn't going to be good . . . \"Just finishing up some of the shit around the garage and trying to keep Sway from killing Raines, Baby . . . and finishing up some small shit with the sell of your apartment and mine . . .\" She nodded uncertainly but knew if it was anything worse he would tell her . . . eventually. He didn't let things blindside her with the other world he and her brother were so deeply emerged in . . . . something she appreciated immensely. She shifted, closing her eyes and leaning into him for a moment before pulling back. \"Okay . . . Well, let's go inside and let me see what else I need to order before I go change and strangle a rep. I swear people are so damn dense its amazing . . .\" Sphinx nodded, turning and opening the door, bustling in before her and refusing to turn on the lights. She groaned, rolling her eyes as he led her through the dark mudroom and hallway into the kitchen. She really didn't have time for this . . . she needed to get all of this done before the place closed for the day or she wouldn't be able to sleep without fretting over the details. He led her to the doorway that separated the kitchen and the dining room, letting go of her hand and-from what she could hear and see in the limited light-moving towards the wall where the light switches were. His voice broke the silence, washing over her in the still darkness of the room and sending delightful little shivers up and down her spine. He really couldn't do shit like that to her after they'd been apart for two weeks . . . it wasn't fair what his voice could do . . . \"Okay . . . If something isn't right don't kill us. Just . . . remember that it was for your own good . . .\" She raised a brow, getting ready to ask what he was talking about before she was blinded by the light flickering to life. And once her vision adjusted she almost fainted. The walls were covered in the beautiful iridescent platinum wall paper with a tiny white, black and teal pattern she'd chosen before she left, the window seals shining with their new coat of high gloss white . . . while the wooden barrel ceiling rivaled the almost mirror shine of the hardwood floors, the latter partially covered by the plush white rug beneath the newly purchased long farmhouse table. Said table was lined with the four white leather chairs she practically had to special order on either side, each sporting a sparkling silver accent pillow. At either end of the table, the bright turquoise armchairs with silver brad details and throw pillows with a vibrant multicolored print to match the various pieces of art hanging on the walls. The handcrafted lapis chandelier hung low over the table, casting a warm glow over the white, silver, black and turquoise place settings. Over all the room had come together far better than she'd ever hoped or dreamed, the two shades of blue green going well together . . . and they'd done it all while she'd been away. She turned, glancing back and at the kitchen as he came to stand behind her, rubbing her back as she took in the changes. She'd never expected this . . . not in a million years . . . The kitchen wasn't too drastically different, save being painted a soothing deep pewter that offset the rich mahogany cabinetry well. Pictures and pieces of art and car memorabilia lined the longest wall, which was decked in a cream and pewter wall paper, while a small wooden table with two plush arm chairs acted as a dinette set was nestled against it. The table was already set, boasting a huge cylindrical vase of blue, green and violet hydrangeas in the center with two simple while and silver place setting in front of the two plush chairs . . . both of their coffee cups sitting in the middle of the pristine white plates. She turned, going through and towards the towering breakfast nook to find two huge overstuffed chairs and small mirrored table nestled between them, adorned with a small silver lamp and a stack of her favorite books, beneath the scrawling branch fixture and facing the massive windows. She leaned back into Sphinx as he wrapped his arms around her, kissing her pulse point before nodding his chin towards the view of the yard. \"Figured it'd be a good place since we really didn't have anything else to go here . . . Nice view to unwind to at the end of the day . . . or start one to.\" She looked over her shoulder at him, kissing him square on the lips before he could move back laughing. He pulled her with him as he moved into the living room, grinning. This is why they hadn't really talked . . . He'd been doing this. But how did . . . \"How did you get all of this done? Because I know you didn't hang wallpaper . . . not willingly anyway . . .\" He chuckled, moving so she could see the room. \"Help from Sway and Paul . . . and Toby when he could manage it. Had to keep Mikhail out or he'd blab the second he was alone on the phone with you. Boy probably thinks I hate him now . . .\" She nodded, knowing the truth to that statement. Mikhail had called and groused about the same feeling of isolation-with the exception of his newly acquired TV he'd scored over Atley- she'd been experiencing . . . but he would be quick to forgive after he saw it wasn't a menacing isolation . . . hopefully . . . The still almond living walls were a warm and inviting palette for the two over sized plush distressed and aged black leather couches with silver brad detailing and the multitude of different colored and textured pillows. All of the trinkets and maps she'd been collecting were displayed throughout the room, a large world map stretched over the fireplace in a shining shell frame. The huge driftwood coffee table sat in the middle, housing the controls to the TV-cleverly hidden behind the map- and entertainment system while she knew the shelves to the sides housed their now massive and combined music and movie collection. Another printed rug, this time sporting black and white with red and turquoise accents, held the room centered. And the faded turquoise suede overstuffed armchairs angled on the far end of the couches allowed for people to sit and move without sacrificing their ability to socialize. She shook her head, reaching out and tracing one of the chairs as they passed it on their way further into the house, Sphinx stopping long enough to open the door for the others and issue a strict warning about shoes. She had to choke back a wave of laughter at that . . . maybe since he'd done this then he'd help her enforce those rules a bit more . . . because he really only seemed to hold Mikhail to them. As the others made their way towards the kitchen-probably in search of beer if she knew Atley and Memphis-she wasn't too shocked that Toby stopped and hugged her, blushing darkly as he smiled bashfully to her. \"I'm glad you're home, Chaosia . . . Do you like the house?\" She nodded, leaning over and giving him a quick peck on the cheek. Which made his already crimson cheeks flush maroon. Sphinx chuckled darkly behind her as Atley came in, brow raised before he started pouting. \"Oh so because I had to babysit the idiot brigade I don't get any affection? Cold Chaos, really cold.\" She laughed, shaking her head before depositing a kiss on his stubled cheek . . . and swiping a drink of his freshly opened beer. Memphis held his hands up, craning his beer from her as he eyed Sphinx behind her skeptically. \"A hug is cool for me, Chaos. I swear. The last thing I need is an irate Sway and a more-homicidal-than-usual Sphinx because I followed in Dumb and Dumber's footsteps . . .\" She rolled her eyes but consented, hugging him and making sure to leave his brew alone before turning to her fiancé. Who was grinning down at her rakishly before nodding towards the other parts of the house. She blushed but followed as the other three made their way back into the living room, practically bouncing from foot-to-foot as she walked into the office suite. The newly added built-in bookcases looked like they'd been there all along, already lined with both books and labeled baskets of her arts supplies. The new lighted wooden desk was in place in front of the window, the new curtains and sheers helping to soften the light flowing into the large room. Two large white armchairs sat against the other wall, a good sized mirrored table between them holding a flower arrangement- which she was pretty sure that Paul had put together because neither Sphinx or Sway would be caught dead with anything floral in hand-and a serving tray to catch their books and papers. Two wall sconce lamps were mounted on the far side of either chair, each controlled by a separate switch for convenience. The computer was tucked away on the desk, only the monitor visible and displaying a slide show of the better pieces of her photography. The huge cream and charcoal swirled rug she'd fallen in love with on sight grounded the space while the row of mirrored picture frames holding the black and white photos of both of their cars in different angles and lighting helping to refract some of the lamp light to make the room seem brighter . . . especially with the pearlescent pewter and titanium striped wallpaper shimmering behind them. Hands on her hips, pulling her back and into him as his mouth left a trail of soft kisses up to behind her ear made her heart beat faster and her breath catch . . . before he spun her to face him and buried one hand in her hair, pulling it free as the other dug into the tender skin beneath the denim of her pants. She groaned as he backed her up to the desk and knew that if his mouth hadn't been over hers then the squeal she emitted when he scooped her up and dropped her on the wooden surface would've outted them. She pulled back, trying to clear her head enough to think rationally as his mouth moved down her chin and back to her neck. He stepped closer, coming to stand directly between her legs as he pulled her to the edge of the desk and flush against him. She shuddered, groaning as his teeth nipped at her collarbone before his tongue soothed the skin. Finally, she managed to pull away enough to cup his face, bringing his eyes up to lock with her own. And dear Lord was that a mistake. She knew that-as soon as the lust and want in his gaze registered-as soon as the others left they weren't going anywhere for days . . . \"C'mon girlie, let me show you our room . . .\" She nodded, suddenly very resentful of their friends in her living room . . . she had missed her future husband far too much . . . and now that she was home, she wasn't liking having to wait to touch him. Especially with all of the sweet, nice things he'd done for her while she was gone. . . . God bless his black little heart . . . He followed her into the master suite and knew that he'd been right earlier to surmise they wouldn't be leaving that bed for the rest of the night and tomorrow . . . . He'd barely been able to keep his hands to himself and even with their company outside he was hard pressed to just toss her into the plush bed and let the others see to themselves . . . His girl really had done a damn fine job of replacing their furniture . . . . and now that he had her back he was itching to enjoy the tall ebony wood Cali King canopy bed. After the mattress and toppers, the bed came to his waist and almost past Chaosia's chest-complete with flowing white sheers hanging all around it, shielding the main bed from view with long billowing white and cream fabric. Though the height didn't keep her from diving into the plush cream sheets and faded charcoal and dusky lavender crushed velvet duvet, with the turned down shimmering silver and plum comforter, the same way she had his own bed months before. She leaned back, sighing into the thousand pillows crowning the head of the bed, her dark curls spread out and mingling amongst the plethora of rich colors and textures. She looked around, nodding at the silver framed pictures and mirrors were placed on the far wall- the mirrored dresser beneath them as well as antiqued mirrored side tables with black detailing- against the dark taupe wall color. She rolled, perusing the small black tray that held the remote control atop it beside the large silver and black lamp and the framed picture of them together from Sway for a second before grinning up at him and patting the bed beside her. He shook his head at her antics before kicking off his own boots and sliding onto the bed beside her . . . chuckling darkly as she moved to straddle his lap. His hands went to her hips, thumbs tracing lazy circles as she leaned down and kissed him, long and sweet. He groaned against her mouth, sliding one hand up to cup the back of her skull and hold her there while the other held her firmly to him. The kiss turned from sweet to passionate quickly and he knew that if he didn't stop them he wouldn't be able to. He wasn't above admitting he was spoiled shit rotten now by her touches and kisses . . . and that two whole damn weeks without her had left him wanting. Desperately. He pulled back, savoring the little whine she let loose as her lips left his. Oh he was going to enjoy hearing all of those little sounds again . . . right after he ran the interlopers in their living room out for the night . . . \"C'mon love . . . let's go run the boys off and we'll come to bed . . .\" She nodded, dropping tiny kisses all over his cheeks and lips as he chuckled, holding her to him. \"and what the bloody hell is all that for?\" She shrugged, answering him as she continued to kiss him. Each word punctuated by a small brush of her lips over his flesh . . . something that was leaving tiny trails of fire in their wake. \"For being amazingly sweet and thoughtful . . . I love our home . . . and I love that you and our friends did this for me . . . And as soon as we get up tomorrow I'll give you the key to your Man Cave . . .\" He raised a brow, curious. What in the hell was she going on about now? \"Man Cave? You have 'em dig out a dungeon I don't know about?\" She laughed, kissing him again. \"Nope. The bonus room that I swore was being turned into a full art studio after you made me mad . . . . is a factual, actual guy paradise. Paul helped me . . . and I took both keys with me incase the temptation was too great to stand . . .\" He looked up at her, honestly shocked for a second before rolling them to where he was atop her and settled between her legs. The boys could see themselves out . . . they had enough sense to know that they should be heading out soon and if not . . . Not his problem. Right now he was going to get reacquainted with his future wife . . . and then they were going to see this promised land she was going on about . . . \"Happy Birthday, wife. I love you . . .\" She grinned, kissing him quickly before he pulled her shirt over her head and groaned at the sight of the cream lace and peach satin demi bra she was wearing. God she knew how to fucking hit him where he lived most days . . . \"I love you too, Sphinx . . . Now . . . you are wearing entirely too many clothes for this to be a proper homecoming party . . . So, I totally can't believe I'm telling you this but less talking and more stripping . . .\" He chuckled, catching her lips with his own. He'd make her eat those words . . . eventually. But right now he was too eager to follow her orders. He'd missed her terribly . . . and it never occurred to him that he wasn't he least bit deterred by that fact.[Chapter 36] Of Jacksons and Bachelors Chaosia knew, by the continuous symphony of oohs and ahhs floating down the staircase from the bonus room, that the boys were more than happy with what she and Paul had accomplished. Sway had opted to stay in the kitchen with her, bringing both of them a drink before dropping onto one of the barstools and grinning like a mad woman as she looked over the huge file folder in front of her. The blonde boost was still far too amused at the level of organization and preparation she'd put into her wedding plans . . . and she was apparently relishing the novelty of the whole thing. And eyeing the wedding cake design she'd sketched out like a starving woman at a buffet. Though Chaosia would be remiss to deny that the four tiered layered cake was going to be a monster . . . big enough to feed the two hundred plus people on their guest list and then some. The cake itself would be almond vanilla-one of the few decisions she'd been able to pry out of Sphinx while she'd been abroad- with the traditional fondant icing . . . that faded from a pearlescent white at the top down to a shimmering pewter with huge clear and black sugar crystal clusters and black, white and bluish purple 'pearls' crafted from icing and laced throughout the fully edible chrysanthemum and hydrangea blossoms blooming on the cusp of each layer; the flowers fading from the base color of the cake to this pretty bluish silver at the edges. Of course no wedding cake would be complete without a topper . . . but she'd been pretty adamant in not having a traditional 'bride and groom', opting to just use this pretty black bronze birdcage she'd found in one of the London shops and have the bake artists hand craft two small birds from icing. One large black and one smaller white to go with their theme. \"So this is what the bridesmaids dresses are going to look like? Nice . . . very nice.\" She sighed, looking over the counter as she blended the muffin batter she'd been putting together and seeing which set of pictures Sway was asking about. The dresses were nice and the same shimmering bluish purple gray that she'd been working into the other aspects of the service. They were also simple and flattering sweetheart dresses with tiny black lace detailing around the bustline. And a full skirt beneath the other that hung ever so slightly below the hem, making the dresses seem to be trimmed in black dainty lace. Said hem came to well below the knee of even her tallest bridesmaid-the model-esque Maetel- and would be comfortable enough even in what was sure to be fairly warm Californian May weather . . . The shoes she'd picked to go with them were actually pretty sweet, satin peep-toe retro glamour heels with black lace around the seams and an elaborate black satin bow. Even Sway was thrilled about those . . . Hair and makeup suggestions were already done for each of her friends, colors and preferences listed for the spa trip the morning of, as well as her own and Selene's. And all of the bouquets were already picked as well, white chrysanthemums and faded blue violet and green hydrangea intermingled with tiny pewter and black fanned twigs. And wrapped with interchanging black and white ribbon. The florist and her stepmother had lobbied hard for her own arrangement to be different but she hadn't relented, only saying that hers could be bigger but she wanted to keep things as simple on everyone as possible. Because she was NOT going to go all Bridezilla over the little shit . . . or the big shit for that matter . . . Sway moved, breaking her from her thoughts as she picked up the shimmering mock invitation she'd worked up the night before almost reverently. The paper was recycled and a much heavier cardstock, ideal for her purposes and a bane for the printer, and would slip into frosted velum sleeves that secured with a black and pewter layered ribbon before going into the matching white envelope. The invitation itself was pretty simple, the body calligraphied to look elegant while her and Sphinx's names-and she'd followed his wishes and gone the untraditional route, just declaring Sphinx and Chaos- were done in a 'dripping' metallic ink and looked more artistic than the rest . . . with their family crests combining stamped over shimmering silver filigree. Sway smirked, tracing the raised crests before looking up at her with mirth in her eyes. \"I can't believe he actually has a family crest for you to put with yours . . . Its so . . . odd to see it, you know?\" Chaosia nodded, knowing all to well exactly what Sway meant. She and Sphinx had fought long and hard before she'd left for London-him refusing to budge on his opposition to having his crest anywhere on anything to do with their nuptials-and she'd finally told him that is was either both or none. And he knew how much she wanted hers to be there. She and that portion of her family might not always agree-hell she hadn't met some of them until a few years her mother passed away- but she was close to a select few and it was her family. Not to mention it would break her Grams' heart for it to be excluded . . . another little tidbit she'd shared. She still hadn't honestly expected him to cave to her wishes, only thinking he'd apologize but explain his reasoning for the refusal . . . which would've been fine with her. So finding the brown paper wrapped box on her father's table-with a letter of apology and a rather old ring with his family seal engraved into the thick, old silver-had been a huge victory for her. And an enormous sacrifice for him. She looked to Sway, leaning in to ensure no one else heard their conversation. Unlike Memphis, Sway could keep a secret. And she definitely needed to know not to goad Sphinx about the seal. \"Its very odd . . . and a very touchy subject. I had to use psychological warfare to even get a glimpse at the damn thing, you know? I mean, he'd told me once before that there was one but I was not prepared for the damn war to get it on paper . . .\" Sway leaned closer, whispering as she started tucking things back into their prospective piles. She was impressed by the progress Chaosia had made in London . . . and in love with her cake, colors, dresses and theme. She and Memphis had agreed that they weren't going to take the plunge for another year or so, so as soon as Chaos landed from all of this she was so enlisting the girl for help. But she was more than a little intrigued by this new piece of information about her fellow runner. \"Really? That bad? I mean, I figured he left for whatever reason but to get so bent outta shape about something like this?\" Chaosia nodded, glancing to the doorway to make sure they were still alone before answering. \"Apparently there's some really, really bad blood between him and his half-brother. Who, by the way, I had no clue about before we started talking invitations. He's fought me to keep the announcements out of the London Social Circles but I had to let Selene do the announcements or they loose face . . . Plus it makes me seem ashamed of him and I am anything but. I just hope he doesn't skin me alive for sending an invitation to his family . . .\" Sway felt the blood drain from her face as she hissed at her friend. Had she lost her fucking mind? Sphinx wouldn't skin her if found out . . . he'd gut her. \"You did WHAT? Are you crazy? What are you going to tell him?\" She blushed, shrugging helplessly before pouring the batter into the muffin tray and tossing them into the top oven. She set her timer and came around the counter, shaking her head as she sat beside her. \"Hopefully nothing. Selene was insistent on sending it and I kept saying no . . . but she didn't listen and did it anyway. I swear when she starts acting human she has to fuck it up someway . . . But if someone shows up I am so laying the blame right where it belongs. With her and Jacqueline. Damn invitation Nazis.\" Sway shook her head, patting Chaosia's shoulder sympathetically. \"Better you than me, Babe. I am so happy that the only people Memphis and I have to worry about are connected with the garage and the Anchor, you know? I would be about to die over all of this socialite crap . . . Speaking of which, how did he take hearing that guest list expanded from seventy-five to two hundred plus? Was it fun telling him?\" Chaosia gave her an incredulous look, tugging the heather oatmeal cardigan she'd thrown over her navy tank top a bit tight around her. Sway glanced down at the cropped and distressed boyfriend jeans cuffed to just below her knees leaving her bare feet visible and had to fight shaking her head. Even dressed like this, the girl seemed younger than she actually was . . . And far too innocent to willingly belong to the towering wall of menace, muscle and mayhem upstairs. But the glittering rings on her fingers and the keys around her neck screamed just the opposite . . . while the ring she'd had forged for him openly declared he was just as happy to be owned by her as she was by him. Sway however almost pissed herself when the girl's deadpan reply reminded her why she and her stoic lover went so well together. They were both out of their fucking minds. \"How do you think he took the news? And no it wasn't fun. I would've much rather set my head on fire and put it out with a fucking sledgehammer than tell him not only did we have to expand the list but now we have to deal with not only Daddy and Selene but Jacqueline and Ambrose as well.\" Sway couldn't help it. She laughed as she wrapped the younger girl in a warm hug, rubbing her back as she groaned. She'd been right earlier . . . better Chaosia than her. Because where the artistic demi-debutant was handling everything thrown at her pretty gracefully, Sway knew she would be about to slice and dice people . . . Especially the future brother-in-law and the wicked stepsister. Sphinx sat-relaxed and nursing is second beer- on the plush couch in his 'Man Cave', Atley beside him on the far end and both watching the re-run of an old soccer game intently. The others were still frolicking around, looking in every nook and cranny for some other wonderful thing to keep them entertained . . . but he'd been thrilled enough with the TV, bar and couch that the rest was just icing on the cake. Though he was eyeing the pool table very seriously . . . Donnie sank into one of the chairs across from him, glass of what looked and smelled like Scotch in hand as he shook his head at Kip and Tumbler's antics behind the bar. Sphinx glanced at them and had to fight the smirk trying to break loose. Those two were probably worse than any two hyperactive kids on crack when they were excited. And while he wasn't going to ruin their fun-yet-he was keeping a weather eye on them. Because Chaosia would skin the lot of them if something got destroyed the first time anyone set foot in this room. He sighed, taking a drink of his beer as Memphis came to sit on the other side of Atley . . . and Freb stood there looking at the couch trying to find a place to sit without being directly beside him. He did grin darkly at that. The boy was clueless but he respected the fact-like Toby-that he was a very private person . . . and that he would gut anyone who aggravated him too severely even if he was about to get married. He guessed that meant the boy deserved to be able to sit with them and not on the floor. He reached out, tossing a pillow the wayside and motioned to the seat, which Freb took very carefully . . . and looked around the room again before speaking. \"Chaosia is really good at this kind of stuff . . . you know the whole decorating gig. She ever think about doing it professionally?\" Sphinx shrugged, taking another drink before glancing to Atley and Memphis. Memphis had asked Atley a similar question and At-like the good little go between he was-had relayed it to answer so he wouldn't have to. He'd know the second Chaosia left he was going to have to work ultra-fucking-hard to get his reputation back on track. And Atley had just gone with him refusing to really speak again-because they were all far too comfortable with his occasional words now for his liking thank you very much-and helped filter some of the shit. Atley took the hint, leaning forward and sitting his now empty bottle on the table. Sphinx smirked. Squarely on one of the wooden coasters. God they were all so fucking whipped now . . . but at least he was reaping the definite benefits. While the others just seemed to obey his wife for fear of his reaction . . . or hers. \"She just likes to do it, Freb. Paul is actually going to go into business doing the whole interior thing though so she'll probably end up helping him some. But she was offered that job with the Jeffersonian's forensic art department so she's going to do that . . .\" Freb nodded, glancing towards the door before turning back to them. \"Yeah, Khail said something about her being excited for that. I mean I know she was in Med School for the whole Pathology deal before her Mom died and she switched to art . . . but this seems like a good mix to where neither schooling will go to waste. Plus . . . she gets to help people . . . and I think that's important to her . . .\" Sphinx knew when he sat forward that Memphis and Donnie were too, getting closer to talk . . . before he grimaced at himself. Jesus he was getting just as bad as Raines and Jackson. That was it, the freeloaders were leaving and he was locking himself and his future bride away until after their honeymoon . . . but first he wanted to hear what this was about. Memphis proved useful in actually voicing the question . . . and he was suddenly very curious as to what all Freb hid from them. This wasn't the clueless kid who'd brought them a drug dealer's car with bags of white goodness in the trunk . . . \"And why do you think that's important to her, Freb?\" He shrugged, head ducked as he rambled on barely loud enough for any of them to hear . . . and Sphinx knew that maybe the two quiet members of Kip's bunch weren't as bad as the three loud ones always thought. \"Well, she's always trying to help Otto and Junie with something if she's near them. Like the cooking with Thanksgiving . . . and she went out of her way to make sure she got all of us Christmas presents. She even sent us all little Valentine cards of this good British candy while she was in London . . . She helps Sway out by talking with her- I mean she seems a lot happier with another girl around who isn't a bitch . . . and she helped you and Kip with the whole Castlebeck stuff . . . Plus she told me she'd teach me how to paint if I wanted her to . . .\" He stopped, taking in a deep breath before continuing. And Sphinx knew that the boy had thought about this. A lot. \"She always tries to make people feel better . . . she's a kind soul, you know? And old souls but a kind one . . . and she'll reap a whole lot of goodness from taking on something that helps put people at peace. I mean, I think so anyway . . .\" Atley and Memphis shared a look as sphinx leaned back into the couch, blinking at the whole route this conversation had taken . . . until Donnie broke all of them out of their stupor by patting Freb on the shoulder and smiling at him. \"Well, I think about the same thing so I guess that makes us right, uh? Girl's gonna be fine in whatever she does . . . if she doesn't pull her hair out by marrying this big lug.\" Sphinx glared at Donnie as the others laughed, but he was thankful that he'd broken the somber and serious mood. He was literally blindsided to hear Freb of all people start listing off ways his Chaosia was inclined to help the people around them . . . and he'd heard the unspoken vote about himself between the younger man's words. And while he didn't like it being pointed out it was true . . . Chaosia had helped soothe a lot of the anger and hatred he'd brought with him across the pond . . . and she'd been slowly forcing him to come to terms with some of it even if he didn't tell her. Going to London had been big for him . . . and while he hadn't had to see his brother he was very aware of the fact they were in the same country again. And this whole family crest shite had about driven him mad . . . until Chaosia had looked at him with those big pretty eyes-watering and about to tear up- and told him both or neither. He'd wanted desperately to say neither but he'd found he couldn't tell her no . . . So he'd relented and sent her the only piece of anything he had that bore his family's seal . . . and had sworn her to not allow Selene to make a huge production out of it. And, when she'd sent him the text that Selene had already done the announcements before she could stop her, he'd had to quell his anger. Chaosia hated the Deb shite as much as anyone he'd seen . . . and her original guest list had been around fifty, after adding in odds-and-ends it had come to seventy-five . . . a number they'd both been able to live with. It was Selene and Guadimus pushing the damn thing into the triple digits . . . and well over 250 from the last revision he'd heard about . . . He sighed, shaking his head as he stood to go downstairs. He nodded to the others, giving Mirror and Tumbler a look as Kip took his vacated spot on the couch. Those boys needed to learn to behave in public . . . they weren't children . . . he shook his head again. They were going to drive him crazy . . . the bloody lot of them . . . Atley waited until the heavy footfalls of their stoic friend sounded like he was halfway down the stairs before turning to the others. Kip, Tumbler and Mirror all relaxed and sank into their seats . . . happy to be able to drop their spazoid act for a few minutes. Memphis patted Kip's shoulder grinning. \"You boys did good. I was beginning to wonder when he would get aggravated enough to leave . . .\" Mirror shed his shades, rubbing his eyes before redepositing them and looking around all of them. \"So exactly why did we have to almost get killed? I mean, could we not talk about all of this at Otto's?\" Atley shook his head as Donnie chuckled, getting up to get another drink. \"Nope. Too many ears . . . besides, I think its kind of fitting that we plan his Bachelor party here . . . Chaosia and Sway are going to keep him busy downstairs long enough for us to get the basics hammered out . . . and she said she'd cover half of whatever . . .\" Donnie nodded, impressed as he sank back into his seat while Tumbler snorted. He crossed his arms, looking very much like a kicked puppy as he looked to Atley. \"Yeah but let me guess . . . no strippers right? No anything fun at all probably . . .\" Atley grinned darkly, having already gotten over the shock of what Chaosia dropped on him before . . . and loving that he got to do it here. Sphinx's little woman wanted them all to have a good time before the wedding . . . and she had brothers and a father . . . she knew what Bachelor parties were about. And so long as they didn't allow anything stupid to happen she was fine with them hiring a little exotic entertainment. \"Actually, I got the green light for that so we just have to find something great.\" Freb cleared his throat, and all of them jumped at the new voice filling the space. \"Um . . . don't we need to make sure its something he'll like as opposed to the rest of us? I really can't see Sphinx willingly in a strip club or any club for that matter . . .\" Mikhail and Toby had walked in while they were talking, the later quickly closing the door before anyone else could follow. And while none of them liked to hear it, they all knew he was right. Okay shit, the strippers might be a no go after all . . . Atley groaned. He suddenly knew why Chaosia had agreed to it in the first place. \"Oh that sneaky little brat! She knew that! That's why she was okay with it!\" Mikhail laughed, grabbing a beer before sinking into the other chair beside Donnie, clinking his glass with the other boost. \"Hey, what can I say? She's smart . . . why do you think our parents had to have someone else do the Christmas shopping? If they did it, she could weasel the info out of them . . .\" They all chuckled until Freb popped up, asking the question that had them all racking their brains. \"So uh . . . what are we going to do? I mean if that's a bust then what do we need to do . . .\" They all shared a look and groaned. Damnation it sucked to have to do this . . . why couldn't he just be normal one damn day? Downstairs, as Sway dismissed herself outside to take a phone call, Sphinx watched Chaosia pull the muffins she'd wanted out of the oven. She grinned, smelling them before sitting them on the counter and relocating them on a plate to cool. She did, however, grab one and break it open, popping a piece of the still steaming blueberry muffin right into her mouth before handing him the other half. He chuckled but took it, biting into the treat cautiously. She tossed the pan into the dishwasher, humming to herself before turning and crossing to him, holding up a piece of her own half for him to take. He grinned down at her, shaking his head before taking the offered morsel. And dragging his teeth across her fingertips. She groaned, smacking him before eating the rest and leaning into his chest. Sphinx wrapped one arm around her waist loosely, eating the muffin lazily as she laid her head on his chest and sighed. If all of their days were going to be like this moment he might actually die a happy man one day . . . He glanced down to her as he swallowed the last bite, nudging her to look up. When she did she grinned, stretching to her tiptoes to kiss him . . . and knock away a rather large crumb apparently. Eh shook his head again, chuckling. She really was too much . . . He motioned to the loft, grinning darkly. \"Think they're done yet?\" Her lips stretched into a little grin just as sinister as his before she shrugged and snuggled back into his chest, wrapping both of her arms around his waist as she spoke quietly to him. \"Probably not . . . you would think Atley would've smelled a set up about the whole stripper deal . . .\" Sphinx shrugged, dropping a kiss on the crown of her hair. He knew that the temptation to aggravate him would be too great for Atley and Memphis, so he and Chaosia had talked and planned the nest way to keep this from being a royal fuckfest. Because Guadimus had called and requested that not only he bring Ambrose-who he wanted to throttle everytime he was in a room with him ore than six seconds- but he was getting the grand pleasure of meeting Bastian . . . Chaosia's half brother who was far too good to meet them properly in England over the holiday. He sighed, looking down at her. \"Too great a temptation to mess with me, Love. Just like I said . . . I wonder if they've realized it yet . . .\" A chorus of loud groans filtered down the steps and he couldn't help it, he laughed loud and hard as Chaosia's shoulders shook with the same mirth. She was right . . . this was far better fun than torturing the idiots at the morgue . . . When Sway walked back in, pocketing her phone and cigarettes, she wondered idly if she'd stepped into the Twilight Zone. Because Sphinx and Chaosia were laughing so hard they were barely keeping each other standing. Even leaning against the kitchen counter . . . She blinked then decided that she had to be dreaming. She'd fallen asleep on the phone with Paul and she was having a daymare. So she had to wake herself up . . . She reached out and pinched herself. And yelped when it hurt. But when she looked back up, the two were still laughing and Chaosia seemed to be crying as she buried her face in her future husband's chest. Finally Sway had enough. She marched closer, hands on her hips as she looked at the two of them tapping her foot. \"Okay. Are you two fucking high or something? Seriously? What the hell is so fucking funny?\" Sphinx sobered some, straightening as Chaosia just looked at her for a moment before breaking into another wave of laughter. After a few minutes, she calmed enough to step closer and whisper to Sway . . . both mindful of the large hand still spanning the majority of her waist. \"Swear not to tell Memphis?\" Sway nodded, leaning in closer to hear . . . and soon she was in the floor laughing right beside Chaosia. And when the others came down to see what was going on, she laughed even harder. Because these idiots had no clue that they were the targets of the joke . . . and not the pranksters. Oh it was great . . . now she just needed to be able to breathe again . . .[Chapter 37] Okay bots and girls, this is a bit different from the lighter things that have happened the past few chapters. With that in mind, I also wanted to let everyone know that this is starting to go a bit into the back story that I've been playing with for Sphinx. It's just one idea of many and I'll probably touch on others in the other stories I write. I own nothing but the ideas and my original characters . . . and I'll let you guys enjoy . . . Bloodlines & Revelations Augustus William Dashell sighed as he sank into the plush leather seat behind the ancient mahogany desk in his family study. It was days like this that he truly hated being a member of nobility . . . . but he knew someone had to do it. He reached out, picking up various pieces of post as he tried to organize the havoc that had befallen his workplace. It was a rarity for the desktop to be in such a state of disarray but he'd been rather lackadaisical about keeping up with the tedious paperwork that accompanied his position within the House of Lords. It wasn't like the others actually did it anyway . . . they had assistants and scholars to do the actual work for them. And even then they rarely had everything they needed for meetings and votes. Blighters . . . . He rolled his slate blue eyes, shaking his head as he made steady progress in cleaning. It wasn't like he had much else to do worth doing anyway. The parties and galas, meetings and lunches that had made up the bigger portion of his time over the past twenty years had gone from thrilling to dull and uninspiring very quickly. And he'd learned to deal with the constant boredom . . . . His hand brushed a slightly thicker piece of parchment and he raised a brow, pulling the elegantly inscribed envelope free from the other papers on the desk. He shrugged, pulling the small dagger he kept as a letter opener from the drawer and separating the lip from the body. He found another smooth frosted vellum envelope inside the linen envelope and had to admit that the effect of the shimmering ink inside and the satin ribbons securing it closed was a nice one. Modern but still elegant. He looked back to the envelope, blinking slowly as he saw the address and crest stamped on the front. Guadimus . . . . He looked back to the vellum sleeve, slowly unwinding the ribbon to see what was inside. Probably the invitation to Jacqueline's monster socialite wedding . He'd heard, at the various social functions of London that the step daughter of the unorthodox but well-liked Lord was rushing into matrimony. Because she and Ambrose were apparently expecting a 'tiny bundle of joy'. He rolled his eyes again, depositing the ribbon carefully to the side as he broke the glittering black wax seal on the back. Just what London needed . . . . more brattish offspring of the whorish and trifling little shits the upper crust had been producing over the past few decades. Seriously, one would think that the money and privilege that these children were born into would prevent some of the shit they could get themselves into. But apparently, they all wanted to be just like the Spoiled Brat sensation sweeping the former colony like a plague. He looked over the invitation and sleeve, impressed by the feel of the paper beneath his fingers and the sheer elegance. This wasn't something the overly trendy Jacqueline or the harpy Selene would do . . . and then he saw the name at the top and smirked. Chaosia. Of course . . . . The spunky wayward daughter from Guadimus's second marriage to that American woman. The girl wasn't anything like the rest of her family, choosing to stay in the States with her half brother-from her mother's first marriage that proved to be thorn in Bastian's side more often than not- and attend a public university. Completely snubbing the Ivy League acceptance letters and the standing offer from Oxford in favor of studying what she wanted and how. The last he'd heard-from Prometheus anyway-in the Fall she was settling into a new home . . . And had apparently found some older chap she'd taken a liking to. He smirked, shaking his head. God in heaven help the bloke because Chaosia was a handful on her best days . . . he'd seen her and that little shit Ambrose go round and round over trivialities for years . . . and knew from his friendship with Bastian that her inappropriate attitude only got worse once she was back in the States. Though he was of the opinion that her brother was the bad influence, Augustus was pretty sure it was probably the opposite in reality. He scanned the information, wondering who in the hell had decided that putting a name like 'Sphinx' was appropriate for a wedding invitation, before glancing to the bottom. He could go with Bastian if he asked, try and be moral support for his fellow . . . Then dropped it like it seared his flesh. Because there, in glittering black and gray ink against white linen paper beside the Guadimus Coat of arms was his own . . . he looked back up at the names at the top, trying to place any family member that could have the gall to not only go through with this but to send him an invitation without asking his permission. As was customary since he was technically the Lord of the House of Dashell. And kept drawing a blank. He reached over, grabbing the phone and searching for Bastian's number in the contacts. He would get to the bottom of this . . . but first he needed to clear his schedule. He apparently had a wedding to go to in two months time. Chaosia groaned as she reached for the phone, looking at the bleary numbers on the screen in vain before answering it. Only an idiot would call her at three in the morning now that she was out of school . . . She just had to wait until the end of April to actually walk . . . . and then two weeks later she was going to march down the damn aisle haunting her dreams every damn night. Except for tonight . . . Sphinx-having taken on an extra shift at the morgue to start banking more time for their upcoming honeymoon-wanted her to at least get a good night's sleep before she had to go and do the dress fittings with her bridesmaids tomorrow morning. So he'd made her a huge steaming cup of chamomile and lavender tea, put on Monty Python-chuckling as he did so . . . and forced two sleep aids down her throat before tucking her into their monster of a bed and heading out. And as mad as she'd initially been at him, she had been sleeping so soundly and deeply when the drug had taken effect that she didn't even remember dreaming . . . until the damn phone started ringing. If someone wasn't dying she was going to kill something. \"Hello?\" \" Chaosia? Its Jacqueline . . . . Look I know its late but I need you to come get me.\" Chaosia sat up slowly, running a hand over her face as she shook her head to try and clear it. Was her step-sister high? Because if she was while she was pregnant she would hop the next plane to kick her ass . . . . She blinked, trying to wake herself up enough to deal with this. \"Jacqueline . . . . I can't come get you. You're in London, honey. Are you okay? Did you take something?\" The whimpers and snubbing sobered her as she leaned forward and tried to concentrate on the phone call. She could barely make out what sounded like a dull roar in the background . . . and distant voices. What in the hell was going on? It was still too early even in Britain for her to be out somewhere . . . Something was wrong . . . very wrong. And Jacqueline's next words confirmed it. \" Actually I'm at LAX . . . I couldn't do it anymore . . . I left London Chaos. I left Ambrose . . . .\" Chaosia walked through the huge glass doors of LAX, pulling her black cardigan tighter around her as she tried to find Jacqueline in the crowd. This place never sleeps. She hadn't even thought to call Sphinx to tell him what was going on; she'd just thrown on jeans and a cardigan over her tank top and gone. But now that she was here she still couldn't wrap her head around what the hell was going on in London. Jacqueline hadn't said much of anything on the phone . . . just that she'd left Ambrose and was in LA County. And that no one back home knew where she was . . . Now if she could just find her maybe she'd be able to get a clear picture on all of this . . . She breathed a sigh of relief as she spotted her stepsister . . . to have to fight the emerging freak-out mode as she noticed the bruising around her cheek and her neck. Jacqueline had always been fair skinned; her peaches-and-cream perfect complexion naturally complimentary to her straw blonde hair-that was always styled to perfection. And hardly ever seen out of anything with a designer label stitched somewhere . . . But here, under the harsh glow of the fluorescent lights she could see that the girl's normally meticulous appearance was nowhere near its usual standards. Her skin seemed hallow and ashen, the bruising dark and blue against her flesh while her hair looked like it hadn't been brushed and washed in a few days. The billowing black sweater seemed to swallow her whole while the jeans bagged . . . the slight bump she knew to be there not even visible beneath the bulging fabric. The huge blue leather hobo bag slung over her shoulder was her only luggage . . . other than the ratty stuffed rabbit that she was tucking reverently back into the bag. Chaosia wanted to smirk at the rabbit, knowing that it was one of the few things that the girl had from her childhood that she actually cherished . . . hence its less than glamorous state. Jacqueline spotted her, moving quickly as she worked her way through the crowd. Chaos wasn't prepared for the bone crushing embrace she found herself in . . . or the tears that started bleeding into the fabric of her shirt as Jacqueline sobbed against her. She barely registered wrapping her arms around her stepsister and petting her hair, trying to work through the knots and tangles as the other girl finally broke down. A few moments later, the stuttering and sobbed words that left her stepsister's lips broke her heart. Something she'd never figured the normally flighty and mean-spirited girl would ever be able to do. \"I'm sorry . . . but I didn't know where else to go . . . I just had to get away . . . Somewhere he couldn't find us . . . \" She nodded, pulling her tighter before taking he bag from her and trying to usher her towards the car. She'd brought the Aston because it was a smoother ride than her Chevelle . . . and she hadn't wanted to traumatize the girl too much by putting her in an American Muscle Car as soon as her feet hit American soil. Though now looking at her she was glad she had. The way Jacqueline moved screamed louder than her bruising that something horrible had happened . . . . and not just the beating. Hopefully the plush, heated seats of the One-77 would be a comfort. As she walked them out and to the car, Jacqueline started to look better the further they got from the airport. When she got her settled in the car and started the engine, the other girl's shoulders sagged and she literally collapsed back and into the seat. When she pulled out of the complex, her stepsister's dark blue eyes were drooping . . . and by the time she started navigating her way towards home she was out like a light, head lulled to the side and propped against the door. Showcasing a very definitive and large hand print at the base of her slender throat. Chaosia felt her blood boil as she turned, making sure to keep her eyes on the road as she reached into her jeans pocket and pulled her cell free. She quickly dialed the number for the Coroner's Office and asked to be transferred to the morgue. When Newman answered the phone she bit back a long suffering sigh and asked to speak with her fiancé. A few seconds-and some very odd sounds-later, she heard a door slam before silence filled the line. She shook her head, slowing for a light as she made her way through downtown Long Beach. God could he not just answer her tonight? \"Sphinx?\" \" Chaosia? What's wrong? It's almost six in the bloody morning . . . You should still be asleep. You have to be at that damn fitting before noon . . .and I am not going to be up to fight you awake.\" She rolled her eyes, slowing for another light as she made her way towards the house. She really hoped he wouldn't blow a gasket over this . . . \"I know . . . and I would be if I hadn't gotten a call from Jacqueline at a little after three . . . \" He snorted and she could hear him grinding his teeth as he groused. She tapped her fingers against the wheel, counting the seconds down until his quiet grumbles became more vocal and she knew he would be willing to listen. If he didn't get his say then she could give up on him actually hearing what she needed him to. For a guy who usually didn't speak he could make it damn near impossible to get a word in edge wise when he got going . . . \" Oh? And let me guess, the silly little git forgot about the time zone difference . . . or was she calling to bitch because she was having to wear something she didn't hand pick for the wedding? I swear when I see your family in April, Chaosia; your father and I are going to have a nice long talk about keeping his wife and stepchildren in line. And out of our hair . . . \" She sighed, glancing over at the still slumbering girl beside her as she made the right onto Quincy Ave. Even from the end of the street she could spot the top of their roof and felt a whole hell of a lot better. She just wanted to be home . . . Actually she just wanted to wake up and find out that this had all been some sleeping pill induced nightmare. But the odds of that happening weren't exactly in her favor. \"Well, you'll probably be getting that chance sooner rather than later . . . Jacqueline called because she was at LAX. Alone and without anything but the clothes on her back and her purse.\" \" What? Why? What's happened?\" \"I have no clue . . . but whatever it is I think it's really bad. All she's said is that she left Ambrose and she didn't know where else to go for 'them' to be safe . . . Sphinx, she looks like she's had the shit beat out of her . . . I don't know what to do about this, Baby . . . \" The silence on the other end of the line was ominous; his displeasure carrying even over the phone as he brooded over the information he'd been given. This side of him-the quiet brooding one full of meance- had always put her a bit on edge . . . but nowhere near as much as the words that he spoke slowly and carefully into the receiver. He was pissed. And she had a few guesses as to why . . . \" I'm lighting out now and I'll meet you at the house. Call Donnie and get his ass on the way. Wait on us and don't try to move her by yourself. If she's in bad enough shape then she'll need to be seen to . . . Is she still . . .\" Chaosia pulled into her driveway and hit the garage button before she reached out, placing a tentative hand on Jacqueline's stomach. She pressed slightly and the girl whimpered, curling more into a fetal position with her back to Chaos and her stomach almost completely covered . . . which worried her. Badly. But her abdomen was still tight . . . and swollen without any large lumps or nodules that pointed to any major damage. She hoped anyway . . . it'd been a long time since she'd been in Med School . . . \"As far as I can tell . . . just . . . hurry? Please. . .\" Sphinx pulled into their driveway as Donnie was getting out of his Jaguar, pulling the large well worn first aid kit from the passenger seat. The larger boost had used that poor kit almost to death over the years, slowly restocking it when his ex-wife would speak to him . . . and Sphinx was thankful for that now seemed to be one of those times from the bulging sides of the bag. They were probably going to need it. He parked, falling into step with Don as they made their way to the half-open garage. Donnie glanced over, only barely awake. \"Your girl was pretty vague about what's going on here, Big Guy. Care to fill me in?\" Sphinx shrugged as both ducked to clear the door and was happy to see Chaosia and Jacqueline still outside. Thank God she'd listened to him for once . . . \"Not a bloody clue, mate. Girl got the call that she was at LAX . . . and got there to find her alone and apparently roughed up.\" Donnie raised a brow as they stopped at the back of the gleaming red Aston. He nodded to the car as he spoke and Sphinx was thankful that Donnie had jumped into this with both feet. That would be a big help should things be worse than he was expecting. \"Anything else I should know? She's not a user or anything right? Because Mikhail hasn't exactly had great things to say about her partying lifestyle . . .\" Sphinx shook his head, knowing that-from his limited conversations with Chaosia while she'd been away- that her stepsister had taken to pregnancy fairly well, leaving the booze, boys and parties her family had feared would ruin her upcoming nuptials behind her pretty easily in favor of trying to be a good mom. The turn around had surprised Chaosia but she'd taken it in stride . . . because it really hadn't done much to curb the other girl's self righteous attitude and snotty disposition. But even with the bad blood between them, he knew this was bothering his fiancé. \"She's pregnant . . . nearly four months along by now . . .\" Donnie cursed, growling as he stalked up to the passenger door and let Sphinx open it slowly. The girl was still asleep, tossing and mumbling occasionally as Chaosia held her hand and tired to soothe her; petting her hair and ever cautious of her injuries. Sphinx glared down at the girl, knowing that- for him and Donnie if the sharp intake of breath and the sound of his knuckles cracking as he clenched his fist was any indication- the dark mars vibrantly shining against her ashen skin was pretty ghastly. He'd dealt out plenty of beatings in his day, spilt more than his fair share of blood and buried a few bodies . . . but even he couldn't fathom doing this. He might not like the way she was to his wife but Jacqueline was a member of Chaosia's family . . . making her a member of his by proxy. And whoever did this would suffer for it. He'd make sure of that. He moved around Donnie, nodding as he bent and-gently-picked Jacqueline up. Chaos moved, unlocking the house door and holding it as he carried her in, Donnie following before she shut and locked it; the sounds of the garage door lowering muffled by the thick oak. He moved through the kitchen and living room to the largest guest bedroom, placing her carefully on the bed and stepping just outside for Chaos to rid her of the bulky black sweater and baggy jeans. He leaned against the wall while Donnie took up a post across from him, neither speaking as they waited . . . A few moments later, she stepped out-the dirty clothes in hand. She nodded to them, going to do whatever with the clothes-knowing her it was a toss up between cleaning them and burning them in the pit out back- and Sphinx saw she'd put the girl in one of his wife beaters; mindful of the dark splotches and marks blossoming around her neck. Donnie came around, setting the bag on the bed before pulling out a few of the things eh was most likely to need. Wraps and bandages, antiseptic and antibiotic ointment were all placed within arms reach before he turned to Sphinx uncertainly. \"Think I should try to wake her up? She comes to while I'm checking her over and she's liable to freak on both of us . . . and do more damage if anything's torn or broken . . .\" Sphinx considered the option before shaking his head. She'd barely twitched when he'd picked her up . . . and so long as Donnie wasn't too rough in his inspection she would sleep right through it. No need to add anymore drama to this than there already was . . . Sphinx sank into the chair beside the bed, ready to help should he need to and began listing the visible injuries and possible causes like he would at work. The bruising around her throat and face suggested not only attempted asphyxiation but assault with-at the very least-moderate force and a blunt object. Her cheek was broken, as well as the orbital process and the bridge of her nose . . . but she should be fine without reconstructive surgery if she didn't swell too badly. But none of the analysis prepared him for what was under the shirt as Donnie lifted it enough to look over her ribs and torso. Jacqueline was still-obviously-pregnant from the slight swell of her lower abdomen . . . but her upper body was littered with bruises and marks; several just above what Chaosia had jokingly teased was her 'baby bump' when they were in London . . . . Though it really hadn't been anything at all then. Now three months later she was definitely showing and had definitely taken a pretty severe beating. While her neck and shoulders seemed to have born the brunt of the attack, her arms were covered in what he knew were defensive wounds and the skin stretching over her left ribs was a bright angry red . . . with raised welts that looked far too similar to a heel print of a man's dress shoe. He glanced up to Chaos as she re-entered the room and knew she was drawing the same conclusions as he and Donnie from the look on her face. She reached out, tracing the print before shaking her head and covering her mouth with a shaky hand. He didn't stop her as she left the room . . . just like Donnie didn't try to stop him from cursing when he saw the mate to the other print on her side. Right above her stomach . . . this had been deliberate. And he could guess the end that this had been the means to . . . Now, after they'd ensured nothing was broken or too severely damaged, he and Donnie were going to leave her to sleep. Lord knows she would need it . . . As they made their way to the media room, he started analyzing the situation they'd found themselves in. Jacqueline had survived a pretty brutal beating . . . And come running to Chaosia to fix it . . . The question was why? The two weren't close, never had been despite Chaos only being a few years her senior . . . and she had-according to both his fiancé and future in laws- always been a bit wild. But she'd settled down tremendously when she'd discovered her impending motherhood. She'd even offered to allow Ambrose to sign over his rights-to name the child a bastard to society-just so she could have it when he'd been lobbying hard for an abortion. A solution that-while nowhere near as scandalous as it had been forty years ago-would still put a blight against her name . . . and her family's while effectively destroying any chance of the child being able to claim any inheritance or recognition from the Windom's. Thus making life incredibly had for said child should they stay in London. Something he himself had far too much personal experience with. He opened the door, spotting Chaosia curled up on the sectional with a half glass of what he hoped was water and her cell phone in hand . . . . talking very angrily into the device before taking a long draught from the bottle. Donnie stopped behind him before moving on to go behind the bar and grab a beer, passing him one of his own as he sank into the plush armchair. Sphinx sighed, cracking open the bottle and draining half before sinking into the sofa beside Chaosia . . . who leaned into him even as she continued reaming whoever on the other end of the phone. He closed his eyes, trying to erase the sight of that girl beaten and bruised in their guest bed . . . because the circumstances swirling around her woke far too many unpleasant memories for him. Only Chaosia knew that he was-in the eyes of London society anyway-a bastard child to a noble house . . . He shook his head, raking a hand over his face as Chaosia's words broke him from his own wallowing and self pity. He almost felt bad for whoever she was laying into . . . Christ was she pissed. And the barest hint of the British accent was leaking through and coloring her already colorful vocabulary. \"I don't give a flying fuck what you were told happened or why, Bastian . . . all I know is that Jacqueline just turned up here in Long Beach looking like she'd gone eight rounds of bare-knuckle brawling with a bloody pikey! She was beaten and kicked! Yes kicked! In the stomach while she was pregnant ! Now I know that you and that little shit stain are friends so I'm giving you this opportunity . . . You will deal with this-before ten am my time or I will tell Daddy . . . No, I don't care will happen to him if I tell Daddy . . . Why? ! WHY? Because Jacqueline is out sister you fucking moron! Did all of the inbreeding in your mother's family just manifest suddenly as a lack of relaying mental capacity? Because I know you are far more intelligent than to have just asked me that question . . . No I don't fucking care what time it is there! Deal with this . Now. Or so help me I will . . . you know what . . . Fuck you, Bastian . I'm calling Daddy.\" Chaosia jerked the phone away from her ear, ignoring the clearly audible protests of her oldest brother on the other end as she hit the end button and pressed the speed dial for her father. She didn't even let her father get more than the first half of 'hello' out before she started. She was so pissed, so upset with Bastian that she was about to fucking scream. How dare he try and tell her that he already knew what had happened? She didn't a bit more believe that Jacqueline had attacked Ambrose in a drunken fit anymore than she believed that Sphinx was suddenly going to sprout wings and become the next fucking Cupid. She knew Jacqueline wanted this baby . . . more than anything she'd ever seen her want before. So when she voiced that opinion he tried to take up for that little shit . . . oh she would see both of them tagged-and bagged if she had it her way . . . Her father for the most part was silent until she finished, giving him as much detail about the injuries and the account that Ambrose had drunkenly relayed to Bastian before he spoke. And when he did, she felt relief flood her. He would take care of this . . . and she would do her best to take care of Jacqueline until they could come get her . . . \" Bloody Hell! The boy asked Selene to take her on a soddin' holiday a few days ago . . . and we haven't heard from 'em since they lit out save some odd text messages the past two . . . Christ. Selene's been worrying but I kept telling her that they were probably just too busy to call. She'll kill him for this . . . Is she there with you know?\" \"No Daddy. She's asleep in the guest bedroom. Look, you guys just figure out what to do and we can handle it for a few days . . . I just can't believe that Bastian took up for him, you know? I mean . . . I know Ambrose is a fucking tool. He always has been . . . and if my brother is going to act like that then I don't want him at the wedding. And I sure as hell don't want Ambrose here unless its as the sacrificial Lamb . . . \" \" I read you loud and clear ; Duckie . . . and I get it. I really do. I'll have a discussion with my wayward son over his choice in friends before we head out to collect Jacqueline . . . Just take care of your sister okay?\" \"I will Daddy. I will. I love you . . .\" \" Love you too, Chaosia. Go and try to sleep some. I'll call you when I have a clue as to when we'll be Stateside . . . G'night.\" Chaosia nodded, hanging up as she turned to look at Sphinx. Who looked just as bothered by this as she was . . . She sighed, setting the bottle on the table and glancing to Donnie shaking her head with a smirk. He was asleep with the empty beer bottle in his hand, head tilted back as he snored quietly. She leaned into Sphinx, nuzzling into his chest as he pulled her closer and dropped a kiss to the top of her head. Eventually he broke the silence, speaking quietly as he worked his fingers through her hair. Much the same way she'd done for Jacqueline earlier. \"So I'm take it Ambrose is to blame for this? And your wanker of a half brother knew?\" She nodded, growling as his hands stilled in her curls . . . then winced as his fingers clenched into a fist. Shit that hurt . . . but she knew how he felt about all of this to begin with. He had good reason to be . . . emotional where this was concerned. And if she'd known any of his reasons before she'd drug him to London at Christmas she would've never suggested it. Because if her same dipshit of a brother she'd just cussed hadn't bowed out at the last second Sphinx would've surely been brought face-to-face with his own. She'd recognized the crest for the invitations and asked the questions . . . and sworn to never bring it up again. She thought all of it was insanely unfair to him but he was content with the life he'd forged for himself in Long Beach-with the family he'd found for himself-and she would respect that wish . . . She just wished his half-brother would use his brain and see that he was still family. She shook her head and he realized he was clutching her hair, releasing it with an apologetic kiss to the crown of her dark curls. She glanced up at him, reaching up to cup his cheek as he looked down at her. He seemed so weary . . . more so than he had after their huge fight in November . . . He leaned into the touch, kissing her wrist before placing his hand over hers as she went to withdraw it; keeping it there as he closed his eyes. Okay . . . now she was officially worried. \"Sphinx? Baby are you okay?\" Sphinx nodded, opening his eyes as he looked down at his future wife. He knew that this was more her deal than his but seeing that things within the Upper Caste really hadn't changed that much just made his heart hurt . . . which was pretty amazing because he had been sure that the girl moving to sit in his lap and cup his face in both of her hands held all of it. Chaosia sat up on her knees, looking down at him as she tilted his face to hers . . . which wasn't by much because he still towered over her even sitting; looking down at him with worry clear in her pretty eyes. He sighed, reaching up and brushing her bangs out of her face as he cupped her cheek. \"Fine, Love. Just tired . . . when are they inbound then?\" She shrugged, leaning down to press her forehead against his as his hands slid to settle on her hips. She pressed her lips against his briefly before answering him. \"They're gonna call when they know . . . As far as they knew she and Ambrose were on some sort of holiday for their anniversary or something. They just thought she was having so much fun with him that she just hadn't called to check in . . . Then these odd texts started pouring in and Selene was about to freak . . . Looks like it was justified . . .\" He nodded, looking up at her. It was easy to see that this was just as hard on her as it was for her family abroad. She'd been truly happy for the girl to have found something to ground her even if it hadn't improved her personality any . . . and he knew she was blown away by this. Despite all of her oddities and eccentricities, Chaosia still held this innocent view that children were always loved and protected. And she became very angry when they weren't . . . He knew-now thanks to the time he'd had to spend with the man while they finished the house-that Paul's abuse at the hands of his father years ago had been the catalyst for their long-enduring friendship. And he could completely envision a tiny, compact eight year old version of his girl strolling right up to the battered boy and holding out part of her lunch like it would make the world better. Just like he could see her seventeen year old self threatening to shoot the old drunk when he'd come to collect his bleeding and abused son. He'd wondered, lying in the massive bed she'd chosen for them and counting the days til she came back, how his childhood would've been if someone like her had been around . . . before deciding to just be thankful he'd happened across her when he had. Even if it had cost him a coat and his peace-and-quiet. He shook his head, trying to jar his brain back to the matter at hand as he looked up at her. She would try and fix this . . . just like she would try to help Jacqueline-and her child- anyway she possibly could. He'd know that the second she'd called him. She would rail against Ambrose and anything else that threatened them until she was satisfied they would be safe . . . just the same way she had for Paul. And he would help her. He pulled her tighter against him, letting her settle in his lap as the sunlight started to peek in through the windows. Donnie's snores had gotten progressively louder throughout their quiet conversation and he knew he needed to rouse the other boost. Allocate him to the other guest bedroom or at least the couch . . . but he couldn't force himself to move. The night that was finally transitioning into day had taken a turn into something none of them were prepared for . . . and as soon as he could will himself into action he knew he needed to call Atley and Memphis; let them know about what was going on and what they might need to do. He hoped that this had been a drunken mistake by the little piss ant he'd met before, and that everything could be resolved fairly quickly and with as little backlash for him and his family-Chaosia and the crew- as possible . . . but his gut was screaming it wasn't. And they needed to be prepared should something come of all of this. He sighed, feeling Chaosia's breathing even out as he let his own head fall back against the top of the sofa. He closed his eyes, rubbing her back lazily as she sighed and snuggled deeper into his chest. She really hadn't been sleeping well since she'd gotten back-between the wedding planning and receiving the results for all of her finals from school the week before-and tonight hadn't helped. It wouldn't hurt to let her doze for a little bit . . . . He shifted, reaching out and flicking on the TV; letting the quiet murmur from the news fill the space as he settled deeper into the sofa. He was barely aware of his own eyes drifting closed a bit longer every time he blinked . . . or his own snores joining Donnie's as he finally succumbed to sleep. God . . . thirty seven chapters . . . sheesh . . . .[Chapter 38] See . . . the other story to kind of trickle through is helping . . . Better in the Morning Chaosia shifted, trying to get comfortable as her pillow moved-again- before finally grumbling and turning over completely. She furrowed her brow, mind slowly waking up. Why was her pillow moving? She opened her eyes, blinking at the harsh morning light pouring in through the windows as she tried to figure out where in her house she actually was. She remembered coming up to the Media Room and grabbing the water, trying to keep herself from consuming anything even remotely alcoholic as she worked to make sense of what happened . . . . She remembered Sphinx coming in with Donnie, both knocking back the beer she'd been keeping herself from before Don had drifted off to sleep in one of the arm chairs. She also recalled her and Sphinx's quiet conversation . . . and her laying her head on his chest. And that was all she wrote. She sighed, turning to look up at her brooding-and snoring- fiancé. He'd apparently gotten as far as she had-which was the sofa-before the late night shift and the cross continental drama caught up with him. Now he was spread across the sectional, one leg slightly bent at the knee with his foot on the ground, with his right arm wrapped around her shoulders loosely while his left arm was slung across his eyes . . . blocking the sun that had blinded her after his shifting had woken her up. His chest rose and fell steadily . . . but she was having to fight back laughter at the fact that he and Donnie-who was still in his chair, though the empty beer bottle had slipped to the plush rug and fallen on its side- were snoring almost in synch. With his treasured hat slung low over his face. She shook her head, extracting herself from his hold so she could go and check on Jacqueline. She still had to call the dress shop and cancel the fittings for today, check on when her family would be inbound and call Paul for back-up . . . but first she was going to force her stepsister to take a nice long bath in her master bathroom's tub. Then they were going to have an in-depth conversation about just what the hell had been happening in London while they waited on their parents . . . Jacqueline shifted, trying to resettle herself in a more comfortable position in the surprisingly soft bed as she fought the urge to burst into tears again. She'd woken up a few hours before in a near frenzy, clutching her searing side disoriented and more than a little confused before the events of the past few days had come crashing down on her. And after she'd collected herself enough to realize she wasn't in England and that she'd actually made it to the safety her stepsister's American home-and long standing quarrel with Ambrose- would mean; she'd collapsed into tears. Why was this happening to her? To them? She'd been in love with Ambrose Windom since her step-brother Bastian had brought him into their home . . . right after a very brutal encounter with the owner of the house she was in. She shook her head smirking as she remembered the encounter. Her mother hadn't even been married to Prometheus Guadimus ten months when he'd practically blackmailed his daughter into visiting. Jacqueline could admit to herself that she had been jealous of the easy way father and daughter interacted-something she lost the day her own had been taken from her . . . as well as the loving reception she'd received from pretty much every staff member and friend of the Guadimus House. But she'd been more insulted that the girl had been allowed to run around in the most appalling clothes the entire time she was in their house. Her jeans and trousers paired with the tanks and tees covered by cardigans were not what was generally accepted within the London social circles . . . but she hadn't cared. Which made her pretty much the same as her grandmother. Just like she hadn't cared what any of her or her mother's friends had to say when they'd come calling; opting to eat in the smaller staff's kitchen and visit with said grandmother than entertain . . . until Bastian had drug Ambrose-and the cynical sarcastic Augustus Dashell of all people- to one of their dinners to meet his new family. Things had gone pretty well, Augustus and her new stepfather carrying on their own private conversation while she and her mother had tried to ignore the argument brewing between Chaosia and Ambrose . . . despite it's rising volume and intensity. But Ambrose finally pushed the wrong button when he leaned across the table-with a wicked little smirk and wink in her direction-and had whispered something to Chaosia. No one had expected the girl-who had been all smiles and sarcasm when they'd purposefully pushed her buttons before-to lunge at the smirking boy and slug him so hard in the face they'd heard his nose crunch. Augustus had sprung into action with Prometheus, grabbing Chaosia and dragging her into the study while she and Bastian had moved Ambrose into the kitchen to wait for the doctor her mother had rushed to call . . . while Lady Guadimus had laughed and sipped her tea. Obviously enjoying the anarchy her granddaughter had brought to her dinner table. She'd talked with Ambrose while they'd waited; and she'd held his hand while the doctor had set his nose and cleaned the small cut on his lip. He'd laughed at her jokes, letting her actually talk about things other than clothes and fashion and how wonderful it was to be a member of a House . . . . And she'd listened and agreed about how uncivilized her new stepsister was. By the time he'd left, she'd been hooked . . . and it had taken her almost three years to make the man look at her as something other than an occasional lover. When she'd gotten pregnant they'd only been officially dating about six months-though they'd been sleeping together off and on since they'd met- and she had been thrilled. She loved the snotty but brilliant heir . . . and had been heartbroken when he'd huffed and insisted she go to a clinic-outside of London of course- and have an abortion. They'd argued and fought for almost a month until she'd finally broken down and explained to her mother what was happening. And God had her mother-and Prometheus astonishingly-been pissed . . . but she'd worked hard to fix it. And until this she'd thought they had. The Lord and Lady Windom had been thrilled to have a grandchild in their immediate future . . . and had put an end to all talks of abortion and signing away Ambrose's rights. They'd decreed that they would be married and that Ambrose would honor those marriage vows or they would strip him of his power and his position . . . and he'd seemed to have accepted it. He'd warmed up to the idea, helping her pick names and look for smaller house for the two of them-because he hadn't wanted to stay with either of their parents after they married- and talked about nurseries and schools and the future she wanted. So when he'd surprised her with the offer of the lake house-to unwind and relax before they prepared for their own upcoming nuptials at the end of March-she'd been thrilled . . . She shuddered, shaking herself as she turned to the knock on the door. She wiped her face, grimacing at the tears she hadn't even known were falling before sitting up and drawing the thick comforter around her shoulders. She was pretty sure it was Chaosia coming to check on her . . . but with who else shared this house she'd rather be safe than sorry. She cleared her throat and called out. \"Come in . . .\" Better to go ahead and get this over with . . . Chaosia pushed open the door and had to fight to keep from flinching. Jacqueline looked a little better in the morning light; the dark rings under her eyes were no where near as pronounced as the bruising and other marks against her skin . . . and Chaosia was sure that after a bath-and the make up Paul was bringing-the girl would look almost like her old self. Now if only they could wipe away the damage that all of this had undoubtedly done as easily then maybe the girl currently disappearing in the billowing blanket might actually be okay. But she knew herself that the blowback from an attack was devastating . . . and the psychological scars were almost always worse than the physical ones. She stepped in, offering her stepsister a smile and was thankful to see the tentative tilt of lip she got in return. She moved to sit on the foot of the bed, laying the folded clothes and towel in front of the other girl. Jacqueline looked over the clothes with a mix of skepticism and hope before she turned her eyes back up to Chaosia. \"Please tell me those are for me . . . And that those pants are not stretchy . . .\" Chaosia laughed, nodding as she settled onto the bed. Only Jacqueline could be in this situation and still be so damn picky about what she was going to wear. She reached out, pulling the clothes out of their careful folds to show her stepsister what she'd brought her. The cable knit cashmere sweater was super soft and long enough that it would cover the bump. And the pebble gray would look well enough against her complexion-and the makeup they were eventually going to do-to help mask some of the worst bruising. The jeans she'd brought her would stretch without looking too much like leggings or maternity pants . . . which she knew they would have to eventually force Jacqueline into with the way she was carrying. She smirked, watching her stepsister trace her fingertips over the lush shirt before looking up to her hopefully. Chaosia reached out, laying her hand over Jacqueline's and squeezing sympathetically before nodding towards the door. \"C'mon, kiddo. You're going to go take a nice, hot bath in my monster of a tub . . . and then my oh-so-loyal hairdresser is going to do something about-\" She motioned to her dirty and ratty tresses –\"the state of all of this . . . .\" Jacqueline looked up at her, eyes watering as her bottom lip quivered. Chaosia knew from that look to brace for impact but still barely caught her as she lunged, sobbing into her chest. She sighed, petting her hair as she rocked her. And trying so desperately to soothe the hurt she knew she was feeling . . . Finally, she looked up at her, tears falling down her battered and bruised cheeks as she asked the question that broke Chaosia's heart. \"Why is this happening to us, Chaosia? What did I do that was so horrible to deserve this? What did my baby do?\" Chaosia sighed, pulling her back into her chest as she petted her hair again; resting her cheek against the crown of Jacqueline's head as she tried to think of what to say. What could she say? \"Nothing, honey. You didn't do anything to warrant this . . . He's just an asshole honey. And we'll fix it . . . Your baby is never going to have to worry about this. I swear . . .\" Jacqueline looked up with hopeful eyes as Chaosia wiped her tears away, cautious of her broken cheek. \"Promise? How could you know, Chaosia? How are you sure?\" Sphinx made his way down the hallway stiffly, going to check on Jacqueline before he went to his own bed to sleep. Donnie had been woken up and made to stretch out on the sectional before he'd descended the steps to the main level of the house. Hell, he'd even been kind enough to draw the blinds so Don wouldn't have the sun blaring in his face . . . the same way he had. He grunted, stopping in front of the guest room Jacqueline was in as he ran his palm over his face. He'd woken up in the Media Room, blinded by the sunlight in his eyes and disoriented . . . with a huge crick in his neck and back. And without his fiancé. He heard voices and knew that both of the girls were inside . . . and he needed to check on Jacqueline before he went to try and sleep. Her side needed to be properly seen to now that she was awake and then he could go take a hot shower and crawl in his massive bed. He might even be able to convince Chaosia to come with him . . . He pushed the door open, totally unprepared for what he heard and saw. He watched Jacqueline looked up with hopeful eyes as Chaosia wiped her tears away, overly cautious of her broken cheek as her fingers barely touched the darkened skin. His future wife looked down at the girl with so much conviction that he knew she would stand behind whatever she promised the broken girl in her arms. And he knew that he would have to stand with it. He just hoped she wouldn't promise something they couldn't deliver . . . \"Nothing, honey. You didn't do anything to warrant this . . . He's just an asshole honey. And we'll fix it . . . Your baby is never going to have to worry about this. I swear . . .\" \"Promise? How could you know, Chaosia? How are you sure?\" \"I promise, Jacqueline . . . And I know because no matter what happened or happens with us that you're a part of our family now. And that man snoring away in our Media Room is dead set against letting anything happen . . . It's what you do for family . . .\" Jacqueline nodded, laying her head against Chaosia's chest again as Sphinx watched them. The girl, even being held and comforted by another person, had her hands on her stomach . . . trying to defend her child from the horror she was living. He sighed, knowing he needed to break this up . . . and almost cringed at the look Chaosia leveled on him when he tapped on the door and they both jumped. He knew she hadn't slept now . . . and she was not going to be pleasant for anyone else to deal with . . . Great. Jacqueline looked up, flinching as she saw him before she settled back into Chaosia's hold. He winced. He hadn't meant to scare them . . . Chaosia rolled her eyes as she glanced down at Jacqueline, who was blushing because she'd freaked. \"I swear I need to get him a damn bell . . . he's worse than the Cat . . . .\" Sphinx rolled his eyes skyward but was thankful for the weak little chuckle their guest gave as she pulled away to sit up on her own. She nodded to him and he had to fight the urge to hop a flight to London. He knew that they would see to this-because he doubted even if Guadimus would let it go unpunished that he himself would be able to- but God he wanted to do it now. He sank onto the foot of the bed beside Chaosia, motioning to Jacqueline's side. \"How's your side? You having any trouble breathing? Any sharp pains?\" She shook her head, looking from him to Chaos before her cheeks flushed. Which only made the bruising on the left side of her face seem black. And his blood boil. Chaosia reached back and laid a hand on his leg, obviously aware of what he was feeling. Ambrose would bleed for this . . . not just for touching an unarmed and defenseless woman but for daring to do anything to upset his future wife . . . . He might be his own special brand of fucked but he had his principles . . . \"No . . . it's tender but no shooting pains or anything . . . Is anything broken?\" Sphinx shrugged before he reached out and touched her cheek. Only to have Chaos wallop his aching back when the other girl hissed. He glared over his shoulder at his fiancé before turning back to Jacqueline. Might as well tell her. \"If there's none of that then probably no . . . But your cheek and the orbital process-\" \"Your eye socket.\" He turned and glared at Chaosia as she clarified . . . before having to swallow his own curses fro the dark look she gave him. He shrugged, continuing like he hadn't been interrupted. \"Are cracked at the very least. It should be okay but when your mother gets here we'll see what you both want done . . . Best thing for now is to soak, eat and rest . . .\" She nodded, looking over at Chaos before turning her eyes back to him. \"Thank you . . . both of you. I-We'll never be able to repay you for this . . .\" He shrugged standing and popping his back before extending his hand to Chaos. Who took it and let herself be drawn into his side far too easily. She must be tired to be so docile. \"Nothing to repay. Tub in our room's bigger if you want to soak . . . And when Donnie wakes up he's gonna wrap those ribs . . . just in case . . .\" She nodded, grabbing the clothes and towel just as they heard the front door slam closed. They both turned to Chaosia as a very high and frantic voice filled the front of the house. Sphinx groaned as he placed it . . . and the other voice accompanying it. Christ when had they started to get so chummy? He glared at his girl while she shrugged. \"Honestly Chaosia . . . Paul and Atley? Already? What the hell did I do to deserve that?\" Jacqueline laughed at their expressions, clutching her hurt side as the towering man looked down at Chaosia in exasperation and more than a little fear. While Chaosia just shrugged and acted like it wasn't anything important. She shook her head. She'd never guessed when she'd met the stoic giant in December that he would be such a good match for her rowdy stepsister . . . but apparently they were a good balance. And she could tell that they were crazy about each other . . . even if he did look like he wanted to skin her alive. She sighed. She wished someone would look at her like that . . . that Ambrose had looked at her like that. But he never had. And despite how much she loved him, she would never allow herself to be close enough to see if he ever would. She looked over as two men poured in the room . . . and she was very sure that the first one was a flaming poof. His blonde hair was spiked and highlighted while his black tee shirt and jeans fit far better than anything she'd ever seen on a straight man . . . without a stylist or fashionista girlfriend that is. He looked her over before shaking his head and turning to Chaos, murder in his eyes as he dropped the two big totes he was carrying to the floor and crossed his arms in a huff. And if he hadn't looked so serious she would've died laughing. This must be the infamous Paul . . . \"Okay Calamity . . . we're going hunting for scumbags. Dig out that hand canon and lets go!\" He turned to her, his pretty blue eyes showcasing exactly how serious he was as he asked, \"Which testicle do you want as a keepsake, sweetheart? The left or the right? Hell, we'll bring you both if it'll make you feel better.\" Jacqueline couldn't help it, she smiled at him and ran a hand through her tangled curls. Wincing as they snagged on a particularly bad knot. \"If those bags are to fix this then that's all I need. Just help me look human . . . Please?\" He nodded, the fury on his handsome features melting into compassion so quickly she knew his head was spinning. Almost as much as hers was. She'd never been around people who were so genuinely interested in her well being . . . And while it was odd, it was nice . . . But nowhere near as nice as the man that stepped up to hug her stepsister. He was shorter than Sphinx, only a few inches taller than herself or Chaosia, with blondish brown hair slicked back away from a roguishly handsome face. His hazel eyes looked her over quickly before turning to the others . . . and for some reason it bothered her. She knew she wasn't at her best-her face was mangled and she was beaten and bruised-but she kind of wanted this guy to notice her. She shook herself as Paul moved to pick up his bags again and started to usher her towards what she could only assume was the master bathroom. She must've been hit in the head harder than she thought . . . either that or the pregnancy hormones had finally eaten her brain. She would talk to Chaosia and see if that was possible . . . but first she was going to let the blonde work his magic. After her desperately needed bath . . . Atley watched Chaosia and Paul take her sister towards the other room-stopping only long enough to give his very visibly tired friend a very sweet, long kiss and making him promise to get sleep- before he turned to Sphinx. Chaosia had called near the crack of dawn and filled him in on what was going on . . . and he'd been out the door before they were even off the phone. He was pissed at Sphinx for not calling but now that he saw him he knew it hadn't been intentional. The man looked like death warmed over . . . and she'd been right to worry over him. He didn't take things hard. But this seemed to have hit home with the stoic boost . . . and hard. He moved closer, both watching the trio disappear behind the bedroom doors before he spoke. \"You okay, man? Chaosia called when she woke up . . . Told me some of it . . .\" Sphinx shrugged, moving to go towards the kitchen as Atley followed him. He propped against the counter and watched the larger runner start the coffee and pull a hue bottle if ibuprofen from the cabinets, dry swallowing four before he moved to sink into the chairs at their table. Atley followed, waiting for Sphinx to break the heavy silence filling the room. Something was wrong . . . \"Girl doesn't know how close she came close to losing her little one . . . and I know when it finally hits Chaos she's gonna do something crazy.\" Atley nodded, totally agreeing. Chaosia might have professed to not liking or wanting children but he'd seen her helping Junie with the Web Cam enough to spot the lie . . . . Even if she couldn't. She liked kids . . . just-apparently- in small doses. And he didn't know a woman alive that could resist the pull of babies and pregnant women in their own families. They always seemed to dote and coo and go utterly insane. Something he hoped his friend would be ready for should Chaosia ever be in the motherly way . . . \"I guess she would have a right to . . . The girl okay? She seemed . . .\" Sphinx shrugged, pinching the bridge of his nose. Which told Atley how tired and stressed he was. He sighed. This was going to change some things for all of them . . . he could just feel it. \"Hell if I know. This is the most human I've ever seen her act. Normally she's just as bad as bloody Selene . . . and she loves to harass and belittle my wife. Almost got her killed in London . . . Actually her being pregnant is all that saved her, way she talks and lords with Chaosia . . . .\" Atley smirked, trying not to point out that Sphinx was rambling . . . or that he'd just called Chaosia his wife out loud. And he'd known that the two girls weren't best friends but Chaosia was proving she was more than decent with this . . . And apparently more than willing to showcase the forgiving nature she usually saved for Sphinx. He sighed, accepting the cup of coffee the other boost handed him before he spoke. \"Well, you know you need anything you guys just call. I'll fill Memphis and the others in . . . let them know a few things to not say . . .\" He set the cup down, looking to Sphinx as seriously as he could . . . which with the piece of hair he'd just spotted that was sticking out and to the side wasn't very. He fought back his smirk and plowed ahead. He hated to have to do this but he needed to know . . . . \"Is this going to blow back on us? In any way, shape or form? Because if it does then we need to be ready . . .\" And while the shrug of sphinx's massive shoulders did little to put him at ease, the hard set of his face told him that should something come of all of this they would be ready . . . He hoped so anyway . . .[Chapter 39] Oh My God! Thirty-nine chapters! Yay! Alright . . . On with the soap opera . . . Of Aftermath & Affection Prometheus Guadimus took another deep, calming breath as his wife snapped at the stewardess. He'd called in a favor and secured the private jet that was currently taxing down the runway faster than he'd dared to hope . . . But he knew-from the positively dour look his wife was wearing- that it hadn't been anywhere near fast enough. Selene had both of them packed and ready to board a plane a scant twenty minutes after he'd gotten off the phone with Chaosia. And had dared anyone or anything to stand in their way of getting to her. He sighed, trying not to drain the third glass of scotch. He had a long flight ahead of him . . . . and seeing as in Bastian was on the plane with them he knew he needed to be sober when he touched down. Because the second his daughter saw her brother she was going to wring his neck. Bastian had sworn he'd never thought it was as bad as Chaosia was claiming. Ambrose had shown up-sloshed and bruised-on his doorstep; ranting like a lunatic as he sobbed on and on about how Jacqueline had just turned on him. His story-if it could be called that-was that he'd caught Jacqueline drinking and tried to stop her . . . only to be attacked. He'd tried to keep from hurting her until he 'had to defend himself' . . . and had come to Bastian as soon as the girl had stolen his car and left. Prometheus snorted, giving into the urge and downing the scotch in one gulp before motioning for another. He didn't a bit more believe the boy's bullshit . . . and he was damn enraged that his son had. He might not have always been there every second of everyday but he knew he'd taught him better than that. Jacqueline had surprised them all with the huge turn around in her behavior. She wanted this baby-even if the father didn't-and had offered to sign away the child's heritage to ensure she could have it. So the likelihood of her suddenly drinking and partying again was almost nonexistent. Something Bastian would know for himself if he had actually been around the girl at all since she'd found out . . . But he kept to his friends and his own social circle. Still running all over Hell and creation with Ambrose and the others while they plowed through as much skirt and pussy as they possibly could. A fact he had been working hard to keep from both Selene and Jacqueline . . . Oh, now he could see Jacqueline attacking the little shite if she knew he was cheating on her-one of the reasons he'd been trying to keep it from her, other than her waning health-and he wouldn't blame her a bit for it. But he didn't care what was happening . . . . If Jacqueline wasn't trying to kill him he should've never laid a hand on her. Defending himself or not. Bastian had agreed with that-now that he was awake and sober himself-and had wanted to come and check on Jacqueline himself. Though he was sure that it was more to see who was telling the truth than for concern of the girl's safety . . . . And to try and soothe his 'enraged and insane half sister'. Prometheus smirked. He hadn't told the boy to what level Chaosia was pissed . . . and he didn't plan to. Whatever beating his little girl-or her future husband if it came to it- chose to dole out to his bratty son was fine by him. Because it was high time Bastian learned that the whole damn world didn't run the way he wanted it to. Now they just needed to make it to Long Beach without Selene killing Bastian or the flight attendant . . . . He stretched and the letter he had for Chaosia-from Augustus of all people- fell from his coat pocket; drawing his mind from its wanderings as he considered the younger Lord. The man was Mikhail's age . . . and did a fine job with all of the duties set before him by the House of Temporal Lords. But he was cynical to a point that was almost off-setting. Until he'd heard him ripping into Bastian for believing Ambrose at all, he'd thought the man could really take a lesson from his girl's beau and learn to keep his mouth shut . . . Now he was just thankful that he hadn't sided with the other Heir. But he guessed that being a Lord at such a young age had forced the man into a level of maturity Bastian and Ambrose both lacked . . . Prometheus shrugged, slumping into his seat as he picked up the fresh-and if he was keeping count properly- fourth glass of scotch he'd consumed since they'd hit the plane. God to be able to drink like that and be aware enough to deal with all of this . . . He reached out, tracing the thick envelope before tucking back into his coat. Whatever the man had to say to Chaosia was between them. He just hoped it wasn't anything that would cause anymore drama. The two had met before-on a few separate occasions- and had even been able to tolerate the other. . . . But he hadn't thought they were close enough to warrant the letter he was ferrying. He sighed, draining his drink. He would find out eventually . . . And if it upset his little girl he would be bagging-and-tagging two noble idiots when he got home . . . Hell, he might even get Sphinx to help . . . \" So what's the word, Atley? She going to be okay?\" Atley shrugged, taking a deep drag from his cigarette as he paced the veranda at Sphinx and Chaosia's. He'd stepped outside to talk to Memphis . . . who was barely keeping the younger crew in place. They were pissed-Tumbler and Toby at the forefront- at what had happened. And while he could appreciate the concern-and knew Chaos felt the same-the girl needed to rest and see her mother before she was attacked by a group of rambunctious well-wishers she didn't even know. \"As far as I know it's some serious bruising and some broken bones in her face . . . Chaosia and Sphinx checked her over, made sure she wasn't too badly hurt before they decided to let her sleep. Chaosia and Paul are trying to clean her up now . . . But Sphinx isn't taking this well, Raines. It's messing with him . . . Bad.\" \" How bad?\" Atley turned, watching his friend through the huge windows before answering their leader. Even from this distance he could clearly see the tension and exhaustion rolling off of the other boost. And the almost uncontrolled rage in his movements. The Sphinx was very pissed about all of this . . . but he couldn't understand why. Now that he knew sphinx was a pathologist-one with forensic training no less- he knew that his quiet and taciturn companion came face-to-face with the victims of all kinds of brutal and violent behaviors. And he'd never seemed bothered by it . . . He sighed. \"Bad enough that Chaos called me. He hasn't slept yet and he looks about ready to snap something in-two. I got no clue what else is going on here but its gotten under his skin. He's worrying me, Randal. I've never seen him like this . . . And apparently Chaos hasn't either.\" \" Just keep me updated on everything, Atley. And after the Guadimuses hit Long Beach soil, we'll try and see what we can do with Sphinx. Is he going to be okay with just you there?\" Atley nodded, tossing his cigarette butt into the flowerbed before he thought about it. Shit . . . If Chaosia saw that she would kill him . . . He grumbled, bending to pick up the butt and take it inside to throw away. Shaking his head as he realized what he'd just done. God he was whipped . . . and he wasn't even the one getting married. \"Don's still here. Asleep up in the Media Room from what Chaosia told me. If things go to get out of hand . . . I've got back up. But I doubt Sphinx is going to do anything to make it necessary. He might be acting weird with all of this . . . But seriously, he hasn't been the same since Thanksgiving . . . At first it was just he was mellower . . . but with Chaos going to London alone and now all of this . . .\" Memphis laughed darkly, making Atley stop just outside of the patio doors. What the hell was so funny about all of this? \" He's acting human, Atley . . . For the first time in forever . . . And to clarify the statement from before I'm worried for him . . . not about him. I know that Sphinx may be crazy and dangerous when he gets it in his head to be, but he's never been to any of us. And I seriously doubt he would do anything to make Chaosia even think about second guessing her decision to marry him . . . Just . . . take care of our friend . . . Okay?\" Atley nodded, ending the call as he opened the door. He looked sphinx over, shaking his head. The man was almost asleep sitting up in one of the two arms chairs facing the huge tower of windows. His eyes closing a little longer each time as he balanced the cup of coffee on his thigh. Something Atley knew didn't happen unless he'd been awake over twenty nine hours. God they needed to get him to either sleep or talk . . . Atley grabbed his own abandoned cup and went to sit in the chair beside Sphinx, careful to move slowly. If the man was finally crashing he wasn't going to do anything to shock him back into being fully awake. \"Sphinx? You okay?\" Sphinx shrugged as Atley spoke quietly, sitting his own cup down before leaning back in his chair and closing his eyes. Atley could see that he was right. Something more was going on here than just the battered girl upstairs-had been since right before Chaosia went to London- and while he might not know what it was he wanted to help. With all of it. Sphinx opened his eyes, turning to look at him before shrugging again. The other man had never been one to carry on long conversations about anything . . . He'd rarely gotten any words out of him at all until a few years after he'd helped him with the Malibu. But he knew-from the way he moved and carried himself-that it was a protective thing. If he didn't get close to people-didn't let them in and allow them to matter too much- then he couldn't be hurt or discovered. And that whatever huge burden he carried wouldn't be brought to light. Which is why he'd never stopped trying to be friendly with the stoic giant. Over the years, they'd moved from occasional acquaintances to companions . . . and from companions to friends. But Sphinx had never seemed so . . . . despondent as he did now. The burden was getting heavier now . . . And Sphinx seemed about ready to let someone shoulder it . . . until Chaosia walked into the room. Atley watched his longtime friend turn to his fiancé, reaching out to pull her into him as she sank onto the arm of the chair. She shook her head at him, her own wild curls falling around her face and shoulders as she smiled down at him. She reached out, smoothing the hair he'd been chuckling at before back and into place before cupping his cheek. Atley watched amazed as Sphinx leaned into the contact . . . and all of the rage, anger and tension he'd been so worried over before melted away as he let out a deep sigh; pressing his lips over Chaosia's pulse point before moving to let her sit with him. The girl curled against his side, tucking her head beneath his chin as he pulled her closer; twining their fingers together. Both of them looked about ready to fall asleep on the spot . . . but Sphinx seemed more like himself now that he had her close. He shifted in his seat, suddenly very uncomfortable with the entire thing. He felt like he was invading on their privacy, watching them together like this. Because he was. While he knew that the two of them had a physical relationship it was odd to see them actually touch. He could count on one hand the number of times he'd seen Sphinx initiate any form of contact between them . . . and it had always been small things. A brush of hands, a quick hug, or a small kiss here or there . . . Most of the time they were just together . . . The way they looked to each other-moved around one another- screamed it louder than any loving action or words could . . . Atley sighed, drawing Chaosia's attention. She furrowed her brows at him and he shook his head, pointing to Sphinx. She raised a brow but looked up . . . and didn't try to fight the smile that spread across her lips. Her poor tired and frustrated fiancé was out cold . . . and had a death grip on her hand as he slept. She moved, trying to find a more comfortable position as the first soft snore passed his lips. That sealed it. She was here until he either let go or Paul came down to get her. Jacqueline had taken to her best friend pretty quickly . . . and Paul had been insistent that he could handle what needed to be done. And ordered her to go get some coffee and check on her 'hunky dunky' before he snapped. She sighed, kissing the spot over Sphinx's heart as he moved, grumbling his sleep. She could tell Atley was as worried about him as she was . . . and it was good to have the other two boosts handy should something else happen. \"Thank you . . . For coming so quickly . . . I didn't know what else to do.\" Atley nodded, leaning forward as he eyed Sphinx for a moment. She smirked. She doubted the man had ever seen her normal brooding and sinister lover so . . . docile. But he'd been awake for almost two days now-since he'd stayed awake with her and her insomnia the night before- and he was drained from all of the drama. He needed to sleep . . . or he would be horrible when her father and Selene got here. \"No problem, honey. Any clue when your folks are gonna be here?\" She laughed, shaking her head. She reached over, pulling Sphinx's arm up to glance at the massive platinum watch he'd taken to wearing. Her father had given it to him as a Christmas present . . . and she'd watched him slowly get used to the clunky thing. After he'd protested having to wear it at all, of course. Now he seemed reticent to take the damn thing off. \"At least another few hours . . . Daddy said he'd cal when they were closer and I'm going to open up their house in Bixby Knolls. Maybe take Jacqueline and let her see where she's going to be staying. So she won't freak out with them here . . .\" Atley nodded, looking back down the hall towards the master bedroom as Paul's laughter filtered through the house. Followed closely by Jacqueline's bell like giggles. They both smiled at one another. She'd known Paul being here was a good thing. \"He seems to be pretty good at getting people to open up . . . Apparently he and Sphinx spent some time together while you were away . . .\" Chaosia nodded, looking back towards the other room. Paul had come clean about everything two days after she'd gotten back. He'd shown up on her doorstep with white chocolate truffles and new horror movie DVD . . . and they'd laughed and gossiped like old times. He'd admitted to telling Sphinx about how they'd met . . . and why they were such good friends. And she'd noticed the change in his behavior around the other man since. Sphinx might not care for how hyper she and Paul could be together. But he wasn't going to make her limit her time with her loyal cohort. And despite his vocalizations about their presence she knew he was thankful for both Paul and Atley's arrival. Or he would be after he got a little more sleep. God, he'd been right to warn her about his crankiness without sleep all those months ago . . . and she wasn't going to subject anyone else to it. \"So I've heard . . . Paul's good at making people feel at ease. And he knows a thing or two about what will make someone who's been beaten and abused feel a little better. I personally think that the haircut and makeup is a bit ridiculous-especially with the extent of the bruising around her eye and neck-but he swore it would make her feel better. So I let him bring it . . .\" Atley smirked, taking a drink of what she knew was probably ice cold coffee. \"And beat a hasty retreat from the impromptu spa I see.\" She rolled her eyes, settling back into her future husband before she answered him. Atley really was too much . . . and just as mean spirited in the humor department as her and Sphinx. One of the many reasons they got along so well . . . . \"Hey. I was banished from the impromptu spa, thank you very much. Despite the fact that it's my bathroom . . . Guess it's for the best though. I doubt even this will keep Jacqueline from kicking into Deb mode once she gets used to Paul . . . And I do not want another sneak attack makeover. The first one was bad enough . . .\" Atley laughed, leaning forward. \"Oh really? Paul did that? Just randomly sprung something like that?\" She snorted, snuggling deeper into Sphinx's arms as she rested her cheek against his chest. He really did make a good pillow . . . She closed her eyes, barely registering that she was mumbling as she answered him. \"Try blindsided me brandishing a curling iron and that gigantic make-up caddy like weapons of mass destruction. I do not want a repeat if I can escape it . . .\" Atley laughed, shaking his head as he watched Chaosia start to doze off. She'd been fighting to stay awake since she'd sunk into Sphinx's arms . . . and she was finally starting to loose the fight. He watched her eyes close longer and longer every time she blinked (much the way Sphinx's had before she'd come downstairs) and knew it wouldn't be long until she was snoring right along with him. He smiled as she burrowed deeper into his friend's hold, shaking his head as Sphinx moved to accommodate her. Even in his sleep, the big lug was moving his world around for her. He sat a few moments, waiting until her breathing evened out before he stood and stretched. He was going back outside-intent to smoke at least a few cigarettes while he called Memphis back to let him know that both of the idiots were sleeping-and then he was going to wander upstairs to wake Donnie up. The two of them could rustle up something to pass as breakfast . . . or lunch . . . And then later, they could go with Chaosia to open up the other house. But first, he was definitely going to heat up the stone cold coffee . . . and find where Sphinx had stashed the cigars he smoked once in a blue moon. Chapter forty coming soon . . .[Chapter 40] Thanks so much for all of the reviews, faves and alerts. It means a lot to me . . . Here is chapter forty . . . Of Makeovers and Drama Queens Jacqueline looked over her reflection in the mirror as Paul curled her strawberry blonde tresses. He had literally brought enough makeup and product with him to outfit an award's show . . . and while she'd been hesitant to let him do anything but mess with her hair he'd finally convinced her. Which is how-after he and Chaosia had forced her to soak for half an hour in the gigantic tub- she had ended up with the thick blue facial mask slathered over her abused flesh while he snipped away like a mad man. And she had to admit that while the mask smelled odd it had made her burning and aching cheek feel better. But now that he was almost done, she could see it had helped a little . . . Oh who was she kidding? The bruising was still bad enough to be seen even under the foundation and blushed he'd applied. But at least now it looked more like shadows against her skin . . . instead of the dark impressions of Ambrose's fists. And the skin didn't feel as raw anymore . . . She sighed, reaching up and pushing her bangs back before Paul smoothed them back into place. She glared at him in the vanity mirror as he narrowed his own eyes at her. A few intense moments later, she rolled her eyes and huffed. He however, just smirked and nodded before going back to fixing the back of her hair. \"I know its close to your eyes but you'll need it to cover the marks. After your face heals some we can try other ways . . . But for now you need to leave it alone.\" She huffed, crossing her arms as she slumped into the chair Chaosia had drug in for them; wincing when she touched her sore ribs. She really did appreciate the effort to make her feel better-and everything that the eccentric man had done for her over the past few hours-but what she couldn't understand was why. She and Chaosia weren't friends . . . far from it actually . . . and this man was one of her oldest and dearest. So why was he doing all of this? Why were any of these people going out of their way? \"I don't see why it matters. My face looks like cube steak . . .\" He grinned, shrugging as he finished. He leaned down, mock whispering in her ear with a devilish grin as he wagged his brows at her reflection in the mirror. Making her have to fight back laughter of her own. \"Ah yes . . . but it used to look like hamburger. See? Already an improvement . . . Besides . . .\" He straightened, going to put away his supplies as she moved to collect the clothes Chaosia had left for her. She picked up the jeans, eyeing them critically before running her fingers over the sweater again. She was skeptical of the jeans-because despite what Chaosia had sworn they seemed to be stretchier than the pure soft denim she preferred- but she was in love with the plush stone gray cashmere. She couldn't wait to wrap herself in something other than the coarse and ratty sweatshirt she'd grabbed from the airport when she'd fled the lake house . . . Paul's voice broke her out the melancholy settling over her . . . and she was thankful for the distraction. Even if she didn't want to have the conversation. \"It might not seem like it right now, but being able to pull yourself together even a little bit will help. If you don't have to see all of the aftermath then you don't have to have constant reminder of it. Because trust me sweetheart, you're gonna carry this with you . . . and you're going to deal with the shit that comes from it. You shouldn't have to see what that bastard did to you every time you look in the mirror . . .\" She blinked, stunned as she watched him clench his fist around a cosmetic brush hard enough to snap it. She watched as he cursed, tossing the broken brush into his case before turning to her with an apologetic smile. \"Sorry . . . I just hate violence . . .\" Jacqueline nodded. Then stopped as she put the pieces together. She turned back to him, looking the taller man over before she spoke. He was still looking at her sympathetically as he moved slowly. Trying not spook her or make her weary of him. Something that Sphinx and the other man from before hadn't done. He had been where she was . . . or at least somewhere close. She raised a brow at him, deciding not to ask questions she herself didn't want to answer. So she decided to pester him instead. \"Wait, you're non-violent and you're Chaosia's best friend?\" He laughed, nodding as he grabbed the now packed cases and made his way towards the door. \"Yeppers . . . I know. I am usually her voice of reason. Lot of good it does me . . .\" Jacqueline laughed, grabbing her clothes and going to change as he shut the door behind him. That decided it, she officially loved Paul . . . Paul walked into the kitchen of Chaos's home to find it surprisingly empty. He looked around before shrugging, moving to go out and onto the veranda. He knew Atley and the others all smoked-honestly it was a miracle that neither Sphinx or Chaosia had picked it up with the way the others blazed through packs- and that if he wasn't out there then his next best bet was the Man Cave. He smirked, remembering how excited he'd been for the others to see it before he sobered. He could reap the rewards of that later . . . but right now he needed to find his wayward companion. Because he had heard the odd girl's stomach growling and knew that they all needed to eat. He turned the corner, going to pop through the doors when he spotted two dark lumps in the larger chair overlooking the gardens. He stopped, awed by the sight before him. Any reservations he might've had about Sphinx being good enough for his best friend went the wayside as he watched them sleep. The brooding man was stretched out, feet propped on the dark ottoman and his head tilted back against the chair as he snored quietly . . . while Chaosia was curled around him with her head nestled in the crook of his neck. What threw him though was the fact that he had her hand in his, holding it tightly enough that he could make out the tensed muscles. A hand on his shoulder caused him to jump, turning and clutching his chest as he looked down at the very amused face of Jacqueline. Who looked a hundred times better in the well fitting clothes. The neck of the sweater sat low enough to not aggravate the bruising he'd seen before but still cover the biggest portions of it, while it was loose enough to not be binding around her chest or her stomach. And the long, dark jeans made the petite girl look a little taller. He narrowed his eyes at her as she covered her mouth, and had to remind himself that while he hated to be scared it had brought her a tiny bit of joy. Something she would desperately need. He sighed dramatically, watching as she moved to look at Chaosia and Sphinx. When Chaosia had called him, he had been livid to hear that the girl was Stateside and hurt . . . and had totally been expecting her to be the size of a whale since she was almost five months along . . . But while the abused aristocrat was definitely pregnant, her stomach was the only part to show it. The swell wasn't as pronounced as he'd thought it should be . . . and while he would admit to not being an authority on women-thank God for that- he knew that it wasn't a particularly good sign. \"Aww . . . That is not fair. They cause far too much damage awake to rightfully look so . . . contented and peaceful asleep!\" Jacqueline's quiet coo broke him out of his thoughts and he had to agree with her assessment. They really were too damned cute to be so mean awake . . . . Especially Chaosia. He grinned, carefully looping his arm over her shoulder and steered her towards the steps to the Man Cave. Atley obviously wasn't outside . . . and that only left one other place the man would dare to go in this maze of a house . . . \"I know . . . Isn't it just sickening? You should see the picture that Sway took of them together before Christmas. They look even worse there . . .\" Jacqueline laughed before her face fell, and Paul pulled her as close as he dared. She looked up to him with watery eyes and he hated that his first thought was about how she would cause her mascara to run . . . He mentally chastised himself. She could cry if she wanted . . . and he'd remembered to use the water and tear proof formula . . . Her words where like a kick to the teeth. And he suddenly wanted to turn back and wake Chaos up to deal with this. Regardless of whether or not she needed sleep . . . He might be gay but he was still a man . . . and he would definitely fuck this up if he didn't tread lightly. God, Calamity had better appreciate the things he did for her . . . \"I'm never going to have anyone to do that with me . . . Even before all of this, Ambrose wouldn't . . . I'll never have that . . .\" Paul sighed, rubbing her arm. Now was when he would normally defer to Chaosia and let her say all of the right things to make everything better. God, he could only do that for her . . . And even then he knew she usually just humored him to shut him up. Finally, he decided to just be honest . . . \"Look honey. Half the fucking world isn't ever going to have that . . . and you know why? Because to have that you have to completely give yourself to another person and trust them not to fuck up. And to let you in on some insider knowledge, he almost ruined their relationship big time before he figured that out . . . But that doesn't mean that you won't ever have it . . . or that you'll be alone and unloved.\" She looked up at him, lip quivering as she smiled. \"Really?\" He nodded, happy he was doing this right. \"Really really. Besides, even preggers you're hot. And there are guys-or girls if that's the way you wanna roll- out there that aren't going to be out off by the fact that you've got a kid . . . You'll find someone to love you-both of you-and you'll be happy. And of you're lucky enough you can have what the two snoring homicidal maniacs have . . . You know, without the bodies and the blood . . .\" Jacqueline laughed, leaning into him as she wheezed and held her aching side. God, her side burned every time she breathed in too deeply-and laughing made it feel like it was on fire-but she couldn't help it. Paul was a loon . . . and it made her feel better that he was trying to help her. When she could finally breath again, she smiled at him, leaning against him as they started to climb the stairs. She hadn't even known this house had another floor . . . \"Thank you . . . for that . . . and for every thing else. I honestly didn't know what to expect when I came here and called Chaosia . . . but this wasn't it.\" Paul snorted, stopping to look at her with an incredulous look. \"Let me guess. You figured because the two or you aren't all sisterly-and trust me I know, I've heard the stories and talked her out of killing you a few times- that she'd turn you away or be all weird about helping you, right?\" She nodded, suddenly feeling very petty. She had never really tried to get to know Chaosia . . . had just made assumptions on most things about the odd girl and taken Bastian and Ambrose's word the rest. And now she could see that hadn't been a smart thing to do . . . Paul however laughed, shaking his head. \"Yeah well, with the way you've treated her before it would've been a safe bet with anyone else. But thankfully for you, Chaosia is a darling and a complete and total bleeding heart on most things. She wouldn't do that . . . none of us would. We may not be high society but we're good people. And to warn you, as soon as her brother get's back from his little trip to Seal Beach he's going to want to have some words with you.\" She winced but nodded. She'd never met Mikhail . . . but she'd heard enough horror storied from her Mother and Bastian that he was every bit as wild and unorthodox as Chaosia. And very, very protective of his sister. She snorted mentally. Shinobi had never been protective of her . . . She looked up to Paul. \"I can get that . . .\" Paul grinned. \"Oh don't worry. Chaos and Sphinx won't let him do anything too stupid . . . or Atley for that matter. I swear it's so nice to have help wrangling the idiots now.\" Jacqueline looked at him, perplexed. \"Who?\" Paul looked at her, smiling as he pulled her back to him and started their trek back up the steps. Something about the way he grinned made her feel very uncomfortable . . . and she was weary of what was waiting behind the white door he kept pulling her to . . . \"Oh don't worry sweetie . . . you're about to find out . . .\" God what was he planning now? Atley was stretched out along the comfortable sectional Donnie had been asleep on, smoking his third cigarette of the hour as the other boost moved around the room, trying to wake up. He'd come upstairs in time to witness Donnie roll in his sleep . . . right off the couch and onto the floor with a loud thud and a louder string of curses. After he'd stopped laughing, he'd helped the obviously disoriented man to his feet . . . and settled in to watch him try to get himself together. He sighed, shaking his head as Don sank into the armchair across from him, grabbing the remote and turning on the TV. \"So their both asleep . . . what about the girl? She still out?\" Atley shook his head, taking a long drag of his cigarette before he answered. \"Nah. Paul got hold of her before Chaosia finally conked out with Sphinx.\" He sighed, ashing before he looked towards the door leading to the rest of the house. He knew Don had been here since before dawn . . . so after they talked, he'd see if the man wanted to go home. Despite what he'd told Memphis. Sphinx was out like a light . . . and even if he woke up now, he would be easier to deal with. And Paul had proved he could be useful in helping calm him down. Because no matter how mad he got, he wouldn't touch the stylist for fear of his fiancé's reaction. He smirked. Not that he would admit it if anyone ever questioned him about it . . . \"Sphinx told me a few days ago that the girl hasn't been sleeping well. She's driving herself pretty hard to get everything for the wedding perfect before her parents got here in April . . . Less Selene could hijack and wreck, apparently . . . She looked as bad as he did . . .\" Donnie nodded, running his hand over his face as he yawned. \"I didn't really notice that last night but with everything going on, even if I had I wasn't about to say shit, man. Too busy concentrating on trying to get the girl as close to rights as I could. I know her cheek is broke and that those ribs are severely bruised . . . What was Paul going to do, anyway?\" Atley shuddered, wincing. He hated to think that they'd left that girl alone with him . . . but he sure as hell wasn't going anywhere near him. He barely escaped the haircut brigade while Chaosia was gone . . . and he knew she would kill him for taking out her best friend not even two full months before her wedding. \"Her hair and some weird facial shit to help with the bruising. Chaos wasn't really for it . . . but Paul has experience with this kinda thing. So she let him loose. Besides, he's probably the closest to understanding . . .\" Atley turned as the door opened, expecting to see Sphinx or even Chaosia walk into the room . . . and was more than a little shocked to see Paul ushering the very girl they'd been talking about into the space, nudging her inside so he could shut the door. And not let the clouds of smoke he and Donnie had filled the room with escape into the rest of the house. Atley watched the girl move, noticing that despite being somewhat stiff she seemed to be doing better than they'd thought. He and Donnie shared a look before he moved to into the other armchair, letting the two new arrivals have the sectional. He smiled gently, nodding to the girl as she sank into the sofa . . . only to raise a brow as she blushed darkly at him; ducking her head as she looked away from him. He leaned back, perplexed as she leaned into Paul's side. Refusing to look back at him as she leaned across and took Donnie's hand. She smiled to the other boost, holding his larger hand in both of her smaller ones as she spoke to him. Her hair was no longer matted and tousled like it had been when he came in; now it was clean and curled, styled to cover the worst of the damage from her attack. \"How are you feeling, Darling?\" \"I'm okay . . . Thank you . . . for helping last night. Sphinx told me that you'd want to wrap my ribs . . .\" Donnie nodded, standing to go grab his bag from downstairs. As he went to leave, he watched Jacqueline turn to him, her face turning even redder before she shot up to follow. \"I'll go with you . . . I need to wake Chaosia up anyway. She's the only one who actually remembers Prometheus's number . . .\" Donnie laughed, holding the door as the girl-with one last glance back to him- darted down the steps. Atley blinked. Now what in the Hell had he done to cause that? On with chapter forty-one! I know two in one shot! You're all amazed . . . nobody comment on that, please . . .[Chapter 41] Okay, i know that this seems slow moving but I promise things will speed up. Soon . . . Whirlwind Homecoming Chaosia sighed as she walked through her parents' home, trying to fight back the wave of sorrow and nostalgia that had been steadily eating at her since her key had hit the lock. She knew this was going to be difficult-she really hadn't been here since a few months after her mother's funeral save the occasional visit while her father was stateside- but she had to do it. Sphinx and Atley had gone to gather her father and stepmother from the airport . . . and she needed to at least have the house aired before they got here. This is why they shouldn't have let her sleep so damn long . . . . Apparently, when Sphinx had finally woken up he'd taken one look at her and decided to move her to their bedroom, practically tying her up in the covers he tucked around her before going and helping the other men with feeding and tending to Jacqueline. Hell, if Sway hadn't busted in-Memphis and Toby in tow- then she'd probably still be snoring away in her bed . . . She knew Sphinx was just trying to help-he'd voiced more than once over the past month that he wanted to her to step back and relax so she could actually sleep- but she was more than slightly pissed at him. She'd needed to get this done . . . and the half a day nap he'd let her take had eaten away precious time. She glanced at her watch, groaning. Now she only had about an hour to completely open up this monster . . . while she prepared herself for the drama that would befall them. Jacqueline had been surprisingly quiet, really on speaking to her and Paul-save the gratitude she'd given Donnie and Sphinx- but she knew the second she saw her mother that everything was going to go from the bad dream she couldn't escape to reality. Chaos turned, watching the other girl eye the house with open curiosity. She did look like she felt better being in decent clothes . . . and the fixed hair –and whatever torture Paul had committed in the name of progress- had seemed to make her stand a little straighter. Like she was a little less at odds now that she was even marginally close to her former glory. Maybe her wayward stylist actually knew what he was talking about . . . Jacqueline reached out, pulling one of the huge dust covered white sheets from the longest sofa in the informal living room. Thankfully, Paul and Sway were working on the upstairs while Toby and Memphis checked over the breaker boxes . . . so all she and Jacqueline really had to do was finish this floor. Which only left the kitchen-the damn thing needed a super cleaning to remove the thick dust that had settled since early November-, the formal living room, the dining room, her father's study and the laundry room . . . They were so never going to get this done . . . \"Why didn't you and Sphinx move here? I mean, I know Prometheus offered it to you . . . Mother was livid . . .\" Chaosia raised a brow before shrugging. This little incident had seemed to jar Jacqueline out of most of her snobbish ways . . . but she guessed some were just too ingrained to be totally abandoned over night. Either that or the girl was just brutally honest and blunt to a point . . . . Which-given Selene's tendency to voice some of the worst things about a person regardless of her company- was probably true. God she and Mikhail were going to freaking kill each other . . . \"I didn't want them to give me a house. I wanted mine and Sphinx's first home together to be exactly that . . . Ours. Besides . . . this is my Mom's house. To live here without her would just be . . .\" \"Weird and depressing?\" Chaosia blinked, turning to Jacqueline in shock as the other girl folded the sheet and dropped it with the others, careful of moving too much with her ribs. She never looked up as she continued, moving on to wipe down the gleaming dark oak coffee table into a mirrored shine before pulling another cover off one of the armchairs. \"I get it . . . I really do. I just thought that you would want to live here. To raise a family where they would have actual things to remember their grandmother . . . I know if Shinobi weren't living in Strathclyde Manor I would be . . . It would be hard but I would love for my little one to be able to see all of the things relating to our family. To my father . . .\" Chaosia shook herself, crossing the room and pulling the other girl into a loose hug. She knew that if anyone had told her three months ago-hell even three days-that she and Jacqueline would be standing in her Mother's home and sharing pieces of the history with one another-bonding and actually getting along- then she would've called them daft. But here they were . . . She pushed Jacqueline's hair out of her eyes, hating that even under the heavy covering foundation Paul had used that she could still trace the impressions of Ambrose's knuckles . . . If she ever got her hands on him she would kill him. Jacqueline broke her out of her thoughts, looking up to her with watery eyes. She really didn't need to be here doing this . . . but she wasn't comfortable leaving her by herself and the girl had refused to just sit and watch. \"I miss him . . . so much it hurts sometimes. If he were alive then he would've done everything in his power to never let this happen to me . . . and if it had he would mount Ambrose's head on a pike as a gift.\" Chaosia nodded, smoothing the girl's hair back in place. \"Trust me, my Mother was the same way. Hell, when Sphinx and I argue sometimes I have to wonder if he'd even be breathing if she were alive. She was very particular over who I dated after . . .\" \"After the other engagement? Your father spoke of it when you and Sphinx were visiting . . . He was intoxicated and telling Mother that he hoped it wouldn't end up the way the other did . . . If you don't mind me asking . . . how did?\" She shrugged, turning to go and clean the kitchen while Jacqueline followed, perching in one of the barstools while she started wiping down the counters. \"We'd dated for years, known one another even longer . . . and getting married just seemed like the next step. I . . . I caught him bed with someone who was supposed to be a friend not long before the wedding. And that was that. I honestly haven't even thought about it in years . . . Well, until November anyway.\" Jacqueline nodded, picking at the hem of her borrowed shirt before looking up. \"How did you survive? I mean, you were getting married. It was supposed to be the being of the rest of your life . . .\" Jacqueline jumped at the bark of laughter that escaped Chaosia as she wiped out the sink. The girl was honestly obsessive when it came to cleaning . . . she'd managed-through their heart-to-heart- to make the beautiful but dusty kitchen almost glisten in the late day sun . . . When had this girl decided to start taking care if herself instead of relying on others? \"Honestly, at first I was devastated. But not because I wasn't getting married. I loved him enough to not wander . . . and it hurt that he didn't feel the same. And eventually that hurt turned to pissed . . . and I started to see that a lot of what I had thought was fine over our relationship really wasn't. We weren't good together-despite how we felt about one another- and we would've eventually ended up the exact same way . . . Except if it had happened after we were married I would've killed him. But now that it's all said and done, I'm thankful.\" Jacqueline looked at her like she was crazy but Chaosia was still smiling. She turned, her long dark curls falling around her face as her light eyes looked her over warmly. A definite first over their relationship. Chaosia tossed the rag in the sink, wringing her hands together before coming to sit beside her on the other stool. The girl's charcoal boat necked sweater wasn't what she normally wore in London . . . and while it wasn't what Jacqueline herself would've ever looked at, she had to admit that the long sleeved jersey knit shirt was pretty. The sleeves came down to her knuckles, almost covering the glittering diamonds on her left hand even as she moved. And the glimmering keys around her throat seemed to shine against the dark material . . . and worked with the shirt and the gray heels to make her fitted jean trousers seem less casual. Even with her face scrubbed clean of makeup and her hair wild and down around her shoulders, Chaosia was stunning-and surprisingly sweet and civilized- when she was happy. And Jacqueline felt petty again as she realized that she rarely let her be happy around her. Something she needed to ensure wasn't the norm any longer. \"Why? You lost everything you worked for . . . that you wanted . . .\" Chaosia glanced back towards the front door as they heard it open and slam shut. She turned, smiling as she squeezed her hand. \"Because if he hadn't fucked up . . . then I wouldn't have made some of the decisions that led me to Sphinx . . . So all of that pain and anger-however real and world shattering it was then- pales in comparison to what I have now. So in the end it was worth it.\" Jacqueline nodded, watching as Chaosia slid from the stool to stretch before patting her leg and nodding towards the den. \"C'mon, little sister. Lets go say hello to the parentals . . . and then we can put my old man to work in his study. Its his mess anyway . . . .\" Jacqueline nodded, grinning as she followed. Chaosia's words made her feel lighter. If she could survive that-which while not the same as this it was still a big deal- then so could she . . . And that made her feel better than any of the makeup or new clothes. Even if Chaosia was never getting this sweater back . . . Sphinx glowered at the surprise passenger in his backseat, knowing that the second he got to the Guadimus household he would be separating a fist fight. Prometheus had met him at the gate, grabbing him by the shoulder in a vise hold and telling him that Bastian had decided to come along. And that under no circumstances was he to stop his future wife from killing her half brother . . . something he would've done anyway. Prometheus sank deeper into the leather seats of the Malibu, puffing away on another of the cigars he'd been breathing in like air since his feet had touched the ground. The man was worried about all of this-for both his stepdaughter and her child- and while he could understand it, he just prayed that he could get the smell out of his upholstery. Because while he knew that Chaosia smoked the same cigars as her father-occasionally- that neither of them wanted to smell them for the next six months. He turned his eyes back to the other man . . . and had to shake his head. This boy acted like every other member of nobility he'd ever met . . . and served to remind him that while he was effectively marrying into one of the more unorthodox families that he would have to deal with the idiots like this more often now. Why couldn't his girl have been a normal, awkward art student? The boy was well built, almost overly bulky with a larger frame than Mikhail or Atley. He had-apparently- taken after his father in the size department . . . but other than that it was hard to see any resemblance at all. It was his dark eyes that made Sphinx want to tear his throat out . . . the almost midnight blue irises seemed to hold this light to them that let you know he was always watching and judging. Something he'd had far too much of in his lifetime . . . and he was not about to tolerate it from this little idiot. Because that it exactly what he was if he thought that the wounds he'd treated on that girl were anything but outright assault. Bastian looked up, catching his eyes in the mirror before turning to look out the windows again, taking in everything as they made their way towards Bixby Knolls. Sphinx turned his attention back to the road, agreeing with Chaosia's earlier opinion of him when she'd spoken. The boy screamed spoilt and classist in his pressed dark navy dress slacks and tight fitting light blue oxford shirt with the polished Italian leather dress shoes (of all things) . . . but he doubted anyone ever told him that from the sheer size of him. He was almost eye level with the Sphinx himself after all; falling in at around 6'1. His short wavy chocolate brown hair was slightly longer at the front- styled to push back away from his face- and seemed to hold the small glints of gold, copper, and honey and bronze hostage in their murky depths. But his skin has a permanent golden color, a few shades darker than Chaosia even after she tanned. The boy had a strong face with high sculpted cheekbones and a long straight nose . . . all gifts from his mother's mixed heritage if his fiancé was to be believed . . . . He sighed, turning into the development and contemplated alerting the others of the incoming storm. He shook himself. Chaosia-and Jacqueline-deserved to be able to have a go at the idiotic noble in his backseat . . . and if Prometheus wasn't going to stop it then neither was he. But if he would be an accessory after the fact if he called her and let her get worked up. At least if she was surprised the boy might stand a chance . . . He grinned darkly, glancing at the man in the rearview again. Who was he kidding? That boy was a dead man as soon as they were through the doors . . . and he would enjoy watching his wife tear into him. Even if he would have to separate them before she committed homicide . . . Prometheus walked through the doors of his American home, feeling a thousand times better once he saw Chaosia and Jacqueline together by the curving staircase . . . Until he noticed the bruises around her face and neck, that is. Ambrose Windom was a dead man when he got back to London. The little shite would be bagged and tagged before he ever knew what hit him . . . Especially if something happened to his grandchild because of his stupidity. He stepped forward, pulling both girls into him as he pressed his lips against Jacqueline's forehead. The girl stiffened before relaxing, wrapping her arms around him as he pet her much shorter hair. God Selene was going to be livid when she saw this . . . He looked down at her, cupping the least bruised side of her face. He could see that she'd tried to cover it with makeup . . . and until he'd gotten close enough to really inspect the damage he'd only thought it was light bruising. He winced, tracing the clear imprint of a set of knuckles. \"Why didn't you come to me? I would've fixed this . . .\" She shrugged, turning to look at Chaosia before looking back at him. They both heard the other car pull in before she answered. And he knew from the darkening of his daughter's eyes that she was just as pissed as he was. \"He told me that there was nowhere for me to go. That he would tell Bastian I was drinking and partying . . . that if I went to the police, he would tell them the same . . . and that we didn't even know if the baby wasn't his . . . I just . . . I had to get away. I had to get as far from him as I could . . . and Chaosia was farthest. He would never come here . . . He was already trying to find a way to get out of coming in May . . . She was safest.\" Prometheus glared, locking eyes with Chaosia as she nodded, reaching out and smoothing the other girl's hair. His girl was so much her mother in this moment-as she smiled at Jacqueline and promised the world- it made his heart hurt. Millennia would be doing the same thing . . . after she shot someone of course. \"I still am. I was serious before, Jacqueline . . . he won't touch you here . . . Neither will anyone else . . .\" Chaosia looked up and Prometheus knew she'd seen Bastian. He moved, pulling Jacqueline with him as they watched her shoulders set. She stalked across the room, completely ignoring Sphinx and Paul as she came to stand in front of her brother. He looked down at her, eyes alight with remorse as he opened his mouth to speak . . . Only to clutch his jaw as her fist connected with it. Jacqueline jumped while Paul stepped forward to break it up. Sphinx however just caught him, shaking his head once before wincing when she brought her other fist up to catch Bastian in the left cheek, the wet crunch resonating throughout the now quiet entryway as his son yelped. Jacqueline shuddered, burrowing her face into his chest as Sphinx reached out and pulled Chaosia back into his chest, wrapping his arms around her tight enough to keep her from lashing out at the idiot. Again. He snorted, rubbing Jacqueline's back. He should've known that the man wouldn't let the girl do too much damage . . . Because in the end, he was concerned for her over the others. Which was a good thing . . . but terribly disappointing today. Oh well, there was always Mikhail to fall back on . . . He grinned. Now his stepson wouldn't be easily stopped should he get the notion to brawl . . . \"Dear Lord! What happened in here? ! \" Jacqueline looked up, seeing her mother-who looked more worried and harried than she'd ever seen her- glance from her restrained stepsister to her crumpled and bleeding stepbrother. She had no clue what had happened between Bastian and Chaosia but whatever it was was severe enough that Prometheus didn't step in to stop it. And had been upset-however momentarily- that Sphinx had. She shook her head, pulling away from her stepfather to practically run into her mother's outstretched arms. As she felt her wrap her in a tight embrace, she hugged her back with all of her might, ignoring her burning ribs or her raw cheek as she buried her face in her mother's neck. She was vaguely aware that she was crying-sobbing-into her mother's hair as she rocked her . . . but she knew that now she really was safe. Chaosia and Prometheus were here to keep everyone that might hurt them away . . . and her mother was finally holding her, telling her everything would be alright. She was safe . . . they were finally safe . . . I know Jacqueline is alittle all over the place but honestly, her head isn't even close to right yet . . . but she is going to be a part of this. I appreciate all of the support and hope that you all enjoy where this is heading . . .[Chapter 42] See! My new (well old-new) brainchild is helping . . . And on with the show boys and girls! Shoulda Coulda Woulda Chaosia grumbled as her father handed her an ice pack for her knuckles, glaring at Sphinx as he perched on the edge of the massive English oak desk that took up the majority of the study. He had grabbed her before she could even begin to really work out any of her frustrations on her idiotic older brother . . . and he didn't look a bit bothered that both her and her father were upset about it. She sighed, holding the pack over her reddening hand before turning completely from Sphinx to her father, snubbing her fiancé as he rolled his eyes. \"Oh for the love of Christ, Chaosia. I didn't let you kill 'im . . . you'll live. That girl has been through enough without having to watch you beat the shite outta the idiot bleeding in the kitchen.\" Chaosia and her father shared a look before snorting in unison as they rolled their eyes . . . which made Sphinx throw his hands in the air and growl. She knew when she and her father were far too similar but her brooding boyfriend didn't seem to enjoy their little display's blatant reminder . . . Oh well. He would get over it. \"I wasn't trying to do anything to hurt her, Sphinx. I was trying to do something to protect her. Bastian is just as much to blame for this mess as Ambrose is. He should've pulled his head out of his ass and done more to protect that girl and her baby. Not stick up for the bastard that tried to beat both of them to death . . .\" Her father nodded, pulling her hand free of the ice to inspect it. She had torn her knuckles up pretty badly . . . but it wasn't anything compared to the damage she'd inflicted upon his son. He sighed, dropping her hand. He might not be a great parent for letting them settle this in a physical manner . . . but Chaosia was too much like her mother to be deterred when she'd made up her mind. And he knew it . . . She'd seen it in his eyes as he'd watched her land her second hit. \"It's more than that. Bastian knows that Ambrose is-well was-engaged to Jacqueline. And he still went out whoring around and partying with him . . . encouraging the very behavior that the boy was told would cost him his inheritance and his ass if anyone outside of this room found it out.\" Chaosia turned, shocked by what her father had told them. Not that Bastian and Ambrose were falling back into old habits-because honestly it was all they really did- but that her father had known . . . and had apparently kept it from both Selene and Jacqueline. The question was why? Sphinx seemed to clue in on that fact, narrowing his eyes at her father as he stood straighter. \"I'm to take it that neither of those two knows that particular fact . . . Care to explain why?\" Prometheus shrugged, sinking into the plush leather sofa beside her as he ran a hand over his face. Her father suddenly looked older . . . and so weary that it worried her. Christ, what all had been going on in London? \"Because Jacqueline's pregnancy has not been an easy one. Hell, she's just now getting to where she can eat and keep some of it . . . and she isn't gaining weight the way the doctors are wanting her to.\" Chaosia and Sphinx shared a look before nodding for him to continue. They'd both noticed that she was nowhere near the size she should've been and that she seemed far more fragile than she had before . . . but neither had taken much time to actually think about it. Chaosia leaned into his side, holding her father's hand as he continued. \"Between that and the shit Ambrose has been pulling its been a hellacious past few months . . . And honestly, if it weren't for the fact of how badly your stepmother swears it would hurt our grandchild, I would have pushed for Ambrose to sign away his rights before. Because that boy has proved time and time again that he isn't going to be anything but a damn sperm donor . . .\" Chaosia turned to Sphinx and watched his face darken before she turned back to her father, squeezing his hand as she pushed for information. \"If that's the truth then why was Selene pushing so hard for this . . . I mean, when I was there last month she didn't really say anything. Actually, no one said anything! Why?\" Prometheus looked at her like she was crazy while Sphinx snorted, moving to drop into the chair in front of them. And he knew from the look on the man's face-and the few conversations they'd had while Chaosia had been in London and since she'd gotten back-that he could understand the reasons for keeping this from them even if she was pissed. But that didn't make seeing that look of righteous indignation and fury crossing his daughter's face any easier to see . . . or any less terrifying. He shifted, patting her hand and tried to defuse the situation before it went nuclear. Which judging by the way she was currently glaring at him was about to be any second. Shite he'd better work fast . . . \"Because with everything going on with you sweetie, we figured you had enough to worry about . . . You're planning a wedding. And if Sphinx hadn't hijacked fixing the house you would've had that to do as well. Selene and I were capable of handling this with Jacqueline . . . And honestly, we thought it was settled. This took us by surprise just as much as did you . . . And I never would've thought the girl would run to you. Not in a million years . . .\" He sighed, watching her simmer as she tried to contain her temper. And when she looked to Sphinx, he knew that the man would have hell to deal with when he got her home. Better the boy than him . . . She looked back at him, glaring as she sighed. \"You still should've told me. I could've done something to help while I was in London. Hell, I could've offered to let her come back with me then! We had room . . . You kept this from me, Daddy. What else are you hiding? What else have you lied about?\" Prometheus rolled his eyes, standing and popping his back before reaching into his jacket and extracting the letter he had for her. He dropped the thick envelope in her lap and turned to stalk to the door. As soon as his hand hit the knob, he turned and sighed; shaking his head. \"I am sorry this caught you by surprise . . . And that all of this happened. If I could've prevented it, you know I would have. But I wasn't going to put you under any more stress than you were already under. Not when you were finally so happy . . . I wasn't going to spoil that for you. Your mother would haunt me till the day I died if I had. That\" he motioned to the envelope she was turning over in her fingers \"Is from Augustus. Who is very pissed with both your brother and Ambrose for all of this shite. I have no clue what it says or what its about but I promised I would bring it so I did.\" He stopped, looking her over as her features finally shifted from anger to confusion, then softened as she looked up to him with worried eyes. \"I love you, Chaosia. And I swear on my love for your mother that I will fix this. I'm telling Selene I don't want Jacqueline back in London. Because apparently it isn't going to be safe for her there . . . If she agrees, can I trust you to help her settle here after your wedding?\" She looked to Sphinx, who nodded once before coming to sit beside her on the sofa. And take one of her hands in his as she fingered the letter with the other. Finally, she looked back up to him, nodding as she smiled. He smiled back at her, nodding to Sphinx before going to open the door. \"AS far as the rest of this goes . . . Ambrose and Bastian . . . it stays between us. Jacqueline has survived too much to have to deal with that too. And your brother is going to think he was sold into slavery by the time I'm done with him. Just . . . help us make sure she's as happy and healthy as we can make her. And keep yourself happy . . . Because I am serious. Your mother will haunt me if I sour your joy so close to your wedding.\" She nodded, looking to him as she pulled her bottom lip between her teeth. \"And what about Ambrose? What's going to be done with that?\" Sphinx watched Prometheus transform into the man he'd only seen glimpses of thus far . . . and he knew now that all those months ago he'd been right. This man was dangerous. And the blighter in London was about to learn it the hard way. The lord grinned darkly, his eyes hardening until even he felt uncomfortable. And Chaosia seemed to relax beside him as she took in what-for intents and purposes-made him almost want to piss himself. \"The boy will be dealt with. Top is already aware and dealing with it . . . When they have him, they'll call. I have that much time to decide just how I want it handled . . . Any suggestions?\" Sphinx watched his fiancé snort, tossing the letter onto the table before leaning into his side. And he suddenly wondered exactly what the quiet, stern man he'd met in passing while they'd been in London could possibly do . . . \"Let Top decide. Whatever he goes with is fine with me . . . You know Selene and the Windoms will never be able to know about this either, right?\" Prometheus just shrugged, turning the knob. \"Let me worry about that. You and your friends go ahead home . . . We can handle the rest here today. I'm sure you'll all need the time to recuperate . . . And Sphinx?\" He looked up, brow raised as the other man nodded to him. And he knew now, that no matter what else happened that Chaosia's father would have his back. So long as it wouldn't harm his daughter. \"Thank you . . . It means the world to me that you and yours took care of mine. It won't be forgotten.\" And with that, Lord Prometheus Guadimus left the room; shutting the door behind him. Leaving both of them staring at the stark white envelope on the table. Chaosia turned to him, squeezing his hand. \"You know Augustus then? You've met?\" She nodded, leaning deeper into his side and burying her nose into his chest. She pulled his hand to her lips, pressing them against the ring there before just holding it. And Sphinx had to admit that it helped with some of the turmoil hearing that particular name had dredged up. What in the world could he have to say to Chaosia that needed to be put in a bloody letter? \"Do you want to read it? I mean, I have no clue what he could possibly say to me . . .\" Sphinx shrugged, watching as she reached forward and plucked the envelope off the table, breaking the wax seal on the back easily before pulling out the thick pressed paper. And Sphinx was shocked at the hate that flooded him seeing that damned crest at the top . . . His eyes scanned the inked words, reading about nothing in particular or important enough to warrant this. Why hadn't he just called her or relayed this via Guadimus? And then his eyes hit the last two sentences and Sphinx glared down at his future wife hard enough to make her squirm. He would murder someone for this . . . Chaosia looked up at him, eyes wide as she read what he had. And the look of sheer shock across her features was the only thing that saved her. But the next words out of her mouth condemned her stepmother to a slow and painful death once all of the dust settled. \"I swear I told her not to send it . . . And when she told me she already had because it was tradition I . . . I figured that it would be . . . Oh God baby I am so sorry. What do I do? How do I fix this? Tell me how to fix this Sphinx . . . Tell me how to make this okay . . .\" He closed his eyes before shaking his head as his work cellular went off. He glanced down at her, staring for a few long minutes before he stood and made his way to the study door. For them to call it had to something particularly brutal. He sighed. They would deal with this later . . . Chaosia moved, grabbing his arm before flinching when he turned to face her. \"Have Atley and Paul take you back to the house . . . or Sway. I don't really care. But this will be settled Chaosia. And this is not fucking okay. Not by a bloody long shot.\" Chaosia sank back into the sofa, head in her hands as she tried to figure out what in the hell had happened to her happy normal life. Two days ago she'd been fine . . . she'd been planning a wedding and living happily in the house her future husband had bought and made for her. But now, as he stalked out of the room and her father's house she had to wonder if he would ever forgive her. She'd sworn she wouldn't let this happen . . . and despite her best attempts it still had. Her lover was going to have to face the family that didn't want him . . . and it was all her fault. She wiped at her eyes, trying to dry the tears before going out to round up the others to give her family time to get acclimated. It wouldn't do for them to see something was wrong when they were dealing with so much more . . . Even if her father had just sworn it was being dealt with in the most brutally efficient method possible. She wasn't going to be that selfish . . . because her selfishness had already caused enough heartache. She glared at the letter on the table, shaking her head as she turned to do what she needed to. Who would've thought that two sentences could bring happily ever after to a screeching halt. I was pleased to receive the formal invitation to your impending nuptials and am equally pleased to inform you that I look forward to attending the ceremony and meeting the newest addition to your family. And, from the presence of my crest, welcome you into my own. Lord Augustus Dashell[Chapter 43] I am not so hateful as to leave you hanging after the last one. Well, not today anyway . . . Patience and Understanding . . . Sphinx groaned, shaking his head as he finished the last of the paperwork on the body he'd been given. The damned thing had been found floating near the pier . . . and had apparently been in the water for more than a few weeks before it had finally drifted back to the shoreline. Meaning that there was literally very little left of it save some deep tissue and the bones. They would probably be sending it to the Jeffersonian later today . . . He grimaced, raking a hand over his face before finally giving up on the forms; tossing the pen to the desk before leaning back in his chair and closing his eyes. He hated that even the thought of something loosely connected to Chaosia made his heart hurt and his anger boil. He was so fucking mad at her-more her family but she'd given her word- but more than anything he was hurt. He'd trusted her with something he hadn't let another person know . . . and she'd effectively brought it out for all of the world to fucking see. To poke and prod at under a microscope . . . But the tiny part at the back of his mind kept chastising him for being so mad at her. He knew how Selene was, and that if she said she'd tried to stop it then she had . . . and the heartbroken look on her face when he'd left still felt like a kick to the gut. But seeing that name, under that damned crest, and the official welcome into a family that had for intents and purposes pushed him aside after his mother's death almost thirty something years ago had torn open every wound and scar he'd fled London with . . . And the sheer audacity of Augustus to actually write her to begin with . . . and like they were on better terms than they were. . . . Sphinx sighed, shifting back and into his seat again. He glanced up as Meghanne poured into the room, glancing at him before moving to collect the folders from the other desk. She stopped in front of him, smirking down at him before his glare sent her one her way. He might be pissed but he wasn't stupid. But he did need to think about this before he spoke to Chaosia again . . . to honestly look at everything from every possible angle before he made a huge mistake or tore down what he'd worked so hard to accomplish. And he was pretty sure he knew who he needed to talk to about it . . . Chaosia sat beside Sway in the Media Room, downing another shot of Jack as the girl smoked like a freight train. But it was okay because she was smoking the pack of cloves she'd swiped from her father right beside her. She watched Sway shake her head, pouring both of them another shot of the dark liquor before sitting the bottle on the bar top a bit too hard. God what a fucking mess . . . Sway sighed, leaning across the bar top to look at her incredulously. She'd told Sway everything, swearing the other girl to secrecy . . . Because she needed help. there were very few people that had known her lover as long as the others boosts had . . . and she was hesitant to go to any of the men with this. They would probably just side with Sphinx and not help her fix the mess she'd inadvertently made. \"So he's from this guy's family, right? And they're like loaded . . . and powerful?\" Chaosia nodded, taking the offered shot before closing her eyes. The liquor wasn't burning as it made its course down her throat anymore . . . and she wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not. But she was damned close to not feeling her heart tearing in-two any more so they were apparently on the right track. \"Yep. And he's not been in contact with him since they were a lot younger. And now, thanks to Selene and myself, he's going to be at our wedding.\" She snorted, taking the next shot Sway poured to the head. \"If we get married . . .\" Sway snorted, taking a slug straight from the bottle before passing it to her. \"You'll still get married, honey. He's pissed . . . but that man worships the ground you walk on. Besides, who else would put up with him?\" Chaosia shrugged, lighting a clove as Sway stole the bottle back. She took a long drag before looking back to her friend. \"What do I do to fix this?\" Sway shrugged, leaning against the bar even more. \"So his deal is this guy being there, right? Being part of something so important . . .\" Chaosia nodded slowly. That was an over simplification but it was a decent one. Sphinx was pissed because the man was going to be present at something that was supposed to be happy . . . but she also knew that wasn't the extent of it. There was too much between them for them to ever be happy with the other's presence. Sway nodded, continuing. \"So get married before he gets here.\" Chaosia turned, looking at her like she was crazy before reaching out and taking the bottle from her and sliding it further down the bar. No more Jack for Sway . . . The blonde boost just rolled her eyes, reaching back to grab the bottle of tequila and open it; continuing her idea nonplussed. \"What I mean is if that's his problem then go ahead and deal with it. Get married with the people you want there and then do the whole social crap for your parents. That way your actual wedding won't be tainted by the noble idiot . . .\" Chaosia sighed, dropping her head to the counter before groaning as Sway laid her hand on her curls reassuringly. They should've left the alcohol alone . . . Mikhail sighed as he opened the door to his apartment, more than slightly shocked to see Sphinx standing there. He ran a hand down his face, stepping back as he let his future brother-in-law inside. He had just gotten back into town at a little after sunrise and had gone straight to bed. He'd gone with Monique to meet her family . . . and he swore now that he was never going back so long as he lived. They were all as crazy and quirky as she was . . . and so damned smart that he felt like an idiot talking with them. The larger runner stepped inside, dropping the heavy peacoat onto his sofa before sinking down beside it. He had no clue what was going on but from the haggard look on the man's face it was serious. He looked him over, moving to sit in his arm chair as he watched the other man lean forward and rest his forearms on his thighs. \"what's wrong? Is Chaosia okay?\" Sphinx nodded before half-shrugging and Mikhail was suddenly very worried. He'd heard his sister's message to call her as soon as he was awake but he honestly wasn't with it enough to do so when he'd gotten home. Hell, he'd barely made it to the bed before collapsing . . . and now he was more than slightly upset with himself that he hadn't. What had happened while he'd been gone to Seal Beach? Sphinx looked up at him, sighing heavily. \"I take it you haven't talked to her then . . .\" He shook his head, leaning forward. He knew it was weird for the man to come to him, to go out of his way to seek him out. But he wasn't going to point it out. He obviously had something to say . . . and he would let him say it. \"No . . . I haven't been home long. I honestly crashed as soon as I got here. I was going to go by the house later to check on her . . . Why? What's going on?\" Sphinx sighed again, shaking his head as he reached up and ran a hand through his short hair. And Mikhail knew that Chaosia was the root of his troubles. Because only someone who was dealing with his sister could look so absolutely crazy and guilty. Finally he looked up and his shoulders sagged. \"I have no clue what to do boy-o . . .\" Mikhail sighed, draining another beer as what he'd learned sank in. He'd had no fucking clue . . . none whatsoever. And he knew that no one else-save Chaosia and maybe their Pops- ever needed to know. He would put forth the effort to be polite to Jacqueline-given the circumstances- so long as she didn't start being all snobby again . . . and he wouldn't skin the man drinking across from him alive for hurting his sister's feelings. This time. He could understand not wanting to see the only other living member of his family, especially with everything that had happened between them. And if the man's stepmother wasn't already dead, he would be putting in the call to Pops and Top to have her dealt with. What she'd worked to do-effectively robbing the man of his birthright- was rotten. And his half brother needed to pull his head out of his ass and get over it. Because Sphinx had every right to be pissed at both of them . . . even after all of this time. He stood, looking down at Sphinx before shaking his head and reaching out to clap a hand on the man's massive shoulder. The boost looked up; obviously still weary even if he did seem a bit more relaxed with having been heard out. And he really couldn't blame him. The last argument the man had with his sister had landed them in a fist fight. \"It'll work out with this guy, okay? I mean hell, look at Ripley and Bastian. They hate one another . . . and I am so pissed at her for hitting him without me there. God, I bet it was great!\" Sphinx chuckled, shaking his head as shrugged. And Mikhail knew from that look that it had been glorious . . . Oh well, the fucking puts would open his mouth and he'd get to have his own go at him before everything was said and done. He grinned, savoring that thought before looking back to Sphinx. \"But where Chaosia is concerned . . . you knew going into this about Pops . . . and when you went to London you knew you'd be going back into that world. Even if it was on your terms. So you can't be too pissed at her for this. Oh sure, be pissed that she let Selene run wild-which we can't really stop but still she could've told you when she got back- and that you're having to do this before you wanted to . . . but not because you're having to period. Because you knew it would happen eventually. From what I understand from Pops, this Augustus and Bastian were pretty close before the guy started to get fed up with Bastian and Ambrose's partying and stupid shit . . . so that's gotta stand for something, right?\" Mikhail sighed, smiling at him as he shrugged before sobering. \"Do you love my sister? Do you want to marry her?\" Sphinx nodded, not even hesitating momentarily despite how mad he knew the man was at Chaosia. And Mikhail knew that they would be fine. If they didn't kill each other before May. \"Then marry my sister and be happy about. So this guy will be there, big deal. From what you've said, he's alone in the world now that your stepmother is dead and gone. And you're not. We may not be much, but you've got us . . . and you've got Chaosia. That's all the damn family you're ever gonna need, brother. And if you ever tell anyone I said that I will deny it till the day I die.\" Sphinx nodded, shocked at the words the boy offered him as he went to leave. He had never imagined that when he came to Mikhail's that he'd just start telling the boy everything. But now he was happy that he had. The boy had surprised him, listening intently before he'd given him as good of advice as he could offer. Sphinx sighed, reaching out and clapping the boy on the shoulder; patting him before he went to pull away . . . only to be pulled into a tight hug by the wiry boost. He stilled, not used to be touched by anyone but Chaosia-and occasionally punched or smacked by Atley- before he reached out and patted the boy's back awkwardly. Mikhail however just laughed, letting him go. \"We aren't going to tell anyone about that either . . . Especially not Chaosia. Because we would never hear the end of it. Now go and try to not kill each other. And I'll go to Pops with you tomorrow to keep peace . . . What time is it anyway?\" Sphinx rolled his eyes as the boy yawned, stretching as he glanced down to his watch. He blinked, looking closer. Christ . . . it was almost ten at night . . . How long had he been here? He looked back to Mikhail, nodding as he moved to the door before the boy could hug him again. The last thing he needed was another damn sneak attack . . . . The boy was apparently as touchy-feely as his damned sister . . . When Sphinx walked into his home, he wasn't surprised to see no one else was there. He sighed, moving to go to the bedroom . . . only to be shocked that the bed was still made and Chaosia was nowhere in sight. He raised a brow, dropping his coat on the bench at the foot of their bed. Where was she? He left the bedroom, looking from room to room trying to find her so they could at least try and talk. But he still hadn't found her . . . His shoulders tensed as he left the office and made his way towards the steps. The Media Room was the last place she could be . . . and if she wasn't there then he was definitely going to worry. He'd already been with her brother . . . He climbed the steps quickly, pushing open the door and sighing as he found her spread out across the sofa. Dressed in just one of his black tee shirts and a pair of the black lace cheeky panties she loved and curled around one of the many pillows for the sectional. He relaxed, crossing to check on her and spotting the empty and open bottles on the bar. He raised a brow. Hopefully she hadn't done that by herself . . . or she wouldn't be moving at all tomorrow. He bent; pressing his hand against her forehead, pushing her hair out if her face as she whined in her sleep and nuzzled deeper into the pillow. He shook his head, kneeling beside her as he tried to shake her awake lightly. \"Chaosia . . . C'mon Love, get up. Let's go to bed.\" She groaned, opening her eyes and looking at him confusedly before stretching and sitting up, running a hand through her wild curls as she looked around the room. \"Sphinx . . . what time is it? When did you get home?\" He looked her over, shaking his head. She was always so hard to wake up when she'd been sleeping deeply . . . and he felt bad for waking her up as he saw the deep bags under her eyes. She needed to sleep. \"Just now . . . You seem to have killed half the bar while I was gone. Let's get something for your head and go to bed.\" She shook her sure to be fuzzy head, swinging her legs around to where she was facing him as she ran her hands over her face groggily. And he knew she was more than slightly intoxicated. Christ, she really had drained the bottles . . . But she finally looked up at him. And he felt his heart clench. Her eyes were red rimmed and swollen . . . because she'd been crying. She reached out, cupping his face in her hands and pressing her forehead to his. And he momentarily forgot why he was even mad as she pressed her lips to his; kissing him slowly and sweetly before pulling back. \"I am so sorry Baby. I didn't mean for this to happen. I just hoped that . . . I-\" She sighed, closing her eyes as fresh tears spilled down her cheeks. \"I never ever wanted to hurt you or to make you uncomfortable. I just got so caught up in trying to follow all of these damned traditions that I honestly just accepted that Selene had already done it. I'm used to that . . . And I am sorry that I didn't do more to stop it. We'll deal with this however you want to . . . I'll do whatever you want.\" He sighed, pressing his cheek against her moist one as he pulled her into him. And the slight shake to her shoulders coupled with the tears still running down her cheeks told him how upset she actually was with all of this. He rubbed her back, shaking his head lightly as he pulled away from her; cupping her cheek as he tilted her head to meet his eyes. \"I want to put all of this behind us. To not worry about anything but us and our family . . . . I want to marry you and let you drive me crazy for the rest of our lives.\" She nodded, leaning into his hold. \"Then lets get married.\" He chuckled, kissing her cheek. \"We are in May . . . or have you consumed enough scotch to forget that?\" She shook her head, gripping both of his hands in hers as they held her face. And looked up at him like she was aggravated that he wasn't getting what she was saying. \"No. I mean before then. I may not be able to stop him from being at the ceremony . . . but I can make sure that we get married with the people around us that we want there . . . Not half of the London elite. If that's what it'll take to make you happy then we could go tomorrow!\" He stilled, blinking stunned before he sighed and pulled her back and into him. He wasn't a fool. He knew what weddings were to women . . . and while the offer might appeal to him he wasn't heartless enough to rob her of her wedding. She wanted it and she would have it . . . Even if he did have to stomach Augustus's company. Finally he shook his head. \"I want to marry you, Chaosia. But I want to stand in front of our friends-our family- and accept you from your father. To pledge to love you and care for you for the rest of my life in front of as many witnesses as I can. And Augustus isn't going to change that. Besides . . . . with everything going on it could definitely be worse. I love you for offering you silly little git but we're going to do this right . . . Even if it kills me.\" She sighed, leaning into him and nodding as he held her. He sighed, scooping her up bridal style and carrying her to the door. As she rested her head against his shoulder she sighed. \"You aren't planning on pitching me down the steps, right?\" He chuckled, dipping to kiss her head as he started down the steps slowly. \"Nah . . . I haven't paid your insurance premium up yet . . . I'm saving that for after the honeymoon.\" She laughed and he knew she was almost asleep as he made his way through the kitchen and towards their bedroom. She snuggled deeper into his hold. \"Okay . . . note to self: be wary of stairs after we get back . . .\" He laughed, shaking his head. God now she would be paranoid about the damn staircase . . . if she remembered the conversation. But judging from the soft snores as he stepped into their bedroom he seriously doubted it. He laid her on the bed, pulling the covers over her. She was dead to the world . . . Now he just had to make sure she actually stayed that way . . . . I know its more normal drama than whats been going on but we all needed a break . . .[Chapter 44] Hello! Unfortunately this is an author's note and not a chapter . . . But I needed to let my readers know that updates may be scant for a few months. Since the end of January we've been in and out of the hospital with my father. And while the last few chapters of Coffee and HMWYBS have been drafted and written there with what we're going to be doing with my Dad there might be a lull. He's been diagnosed with end stage liver disease and we're in the testing process to see if either myself or my sister are viable donors for a live transplant. This doesn't mean I'm abandoning these stories-far from it, they're probably going to be one of the few things keeping me sane. But there might be a few extra days between updates. Or maybe not, so we're just going to wait and see. And for the people who have read and responded to Summer, I thank you. That's the new 'keep the oldest sane and from killing doctors' dumping ground. But its fun to write . . . and its growing faster than even Coffee or Learning Curve did. But its also the second basis i played with for Gone in 60 Seconds so . . . it's been jumping around in my head for a while. And- if the hospitalist yells at me for smoking again it will probably see more updates than the others . . . Anyway . . . Thank you all . . . Chaos[Chapter 45] Thanks so much for the support and being so understanding. And I have-between trying to keep myself sane with Summer and not to murder doctors- found the time to get another chapter up for coffee. Which is probably going to see a few more updates because my sister has decided that it & Summer are tied for her favorite (because she's a nut like me I guess). Inerno, thank you for the well wishing and Midnight all I can say is you rock. Loose Ends and Final Invitations Top grinned as the little piss in front of him screamed and cried, trying to get away. Not that he could . . . he was tied rather effectively to the chair he was in. And there were few thing McKenna could do better than tie ropes . . . other than make people scream. The boy had been trying to evade them for almost two weeks but they finally tracked him to the small lake cottage his family owned. Which was rather ironic considering if they'd caught him in the city a few broken bones and the warning were all he'd have really gotten. Despite what his niece was baying for across the pond. But now that he'd had to chase the blighter, to track him and waste valuable time . . . he was going to suffer. And his treasured niece was going to get her wishes. As usual . . . He moved around Errol and McKenna, nodding to them as he knelt in front of the bloody and bruised boy. He'd seen the aftermath of the girl-the little shit actually had a damn picture of it on his phone- and he had made sure that with what else the boys did he personally delivered the same wounds to him. He reached into his back pocket, pulling out the heavy and folded pieces of writ that the little piss needed to sign before he would even consider letting him go. \"Now Ambrose. Nobody can hear your screams, lad. More to the point nobody cares enough to help even if they could. Not about a toxic little shite like you . . . Now, we're going to talk about Jacqueline . . . and her baby. And you are going to do what I want you to. Or Errol here is going to start peeling that pretty face of bit by bit. Do you understand?\" Ambrose sobbed again pathetically but nodded, looking up at them with frightened panicked eyes. And Top knew that now he'd do whatever he wanted him to. \"Good lad. Now, you're going to sign this . . . and then we're going to have a nice talk about why we don't hit women. Or try to kill or children.\" He paled, shaking his head as he tried to move. And Top just grinned, chuckling darkly as he reached out and caught his face in his hand harshly. \"Make no mistake lad. You're signing this . . . and you're going to do what I want. Or they'll fish your worthless carcass out of the Themes like they should have years ago.\" He let him go, reaching into his pocket and pulling out the prepaid he used for business. He knew that Prometheus had given one to Chaosia . . . and if anyone could appreciate the sight before him it was his niece. He held it up, snapping a picture before sending it with a shake of his head as he cracked his knuckles. He still had her little part to exact anyway. Sphinx sighed as he watched Atley try on his tux, trying not to chuckle as he grumbled about the length. Chaosia had refused to let him cancel this . . . and had even sent Bastian and Mikhail with them as some sort of bonding ritual while her father attend to some business with work and settling their move. He snorted, shaking his head. He knew a damned torture chamber when he saw one. And that is exactly what his poor Malibu had become. Memphis was driving Eleanor and had the Donnie and Toby with him . . . but he knew that the atmosphere in both cars was more than slightly strained. Especially since Memphis seemed about ready to scream as it was. Apparently in the two weeks that Jacqueline had been stateside-and the three times she'd been to the actual garage with Chaosia while she tried to get the girl acclimated to the city- Tumbler had decided that he was madly in love with the girl. And hadn't cared less when he'd been told she was pregnant, claiming it just meant beautiful kids. So at first they had let the little crush go on and so long as he didn't act out of line Sphinx was content to let Chaosia and Raines deal with the damned shite. Until his wife-to-be had dropped an epic bombshell on him after Atley snapped at the boy's puppy dog eyes and whipped sighs. Jacqueline had yet to notice the blonde boost as anything other than one of their younger friends . . . but she was steadily showing more and more interest in his best friend, Atley. Who was steadily getting grumpier and grumpier with every bloody word about said girl that spilled from Tumbler's mouth. He sighed, running a hand down his face before turning to keep and eye on Bastian and Mikhail. Mikhail seemed to tolerate the other boy about as well as he did, but he'd been in the Guadimus family long enough-and had Prometheus's blessing the fucking shite- to thoroughly pummel the brat if he got out of line. Something Chaosia had warned would be quick to happen if Bastian stepped out of line. Where the oldest child of Guadimus apparently had a mouth on him, both Chaosia and Mikhail had inherited a temper to reckoned with from their mother. And it was only by the grace of God the two of them hadn't come to blows yet . . . Because he'd sworn to both Chaos and Prometheus that when it happened he wasn't going to stop it. And in the middle of the damned tailor's he would be forced to . . . if he wanted to wear a tux to get married anyway. He had no problem with someone beating her oldest brother into submission . . . he just didn't want to have to set and wrap her knuckles not even a month before their damned wedding. And with the way the boy kept egging Mikhail on it was only going to be a matter of time before the good natured lad snapped. And unleashed the fury that he himself dreaded ever contending with again. That boy packed a damned punch when he was pissed. And trifling with his sister was the fastest way to piss him off . . . He reached into his pocket, pulling out his cell before sending Chaos a text as Atley turned and glared at him. She owed him for this . . . and he damn well intended to collect once they got home. \"Seriously Sphinx? The damned thing is shiny. What self respecting man wears a shiny suit that isn't a pimp?\" He snorted, rolling his eyes before motioning to his suit. It wasn't that bad . . . and the sheen came from the fact that it was a wool and silk blend. Meaning it was damned expensive even just to rent. But it was what Chaosia wanted and by God she would have it if it killed him. She was going to be happy with their wedding and every damned thing about it . . . . because she bloody deserved it. And Jackson needed to stop bitching. \"The kind that wants peace and quiet after his wedding. Just let them take the damned thing up. You're not even going to be in it two hours.\" Atley rolled his eyes, grumbling again as he stalked over to the tailor. And Memphis waited until he was out of ear shot to start snickering while Toby sighed and shook his head. Which had even him trying not to laugh. The boy had grown a lot . . . and he was finding it easier and easier to be around him. He actually seemed more at ease here with the Old School . . . even with Atley's whining. \"Think the girls are doing any better?\" Sphinx cringed before shaking his head. Chaosia and Sway were alone with Selene and Jacqueline . . . and though Paul and Maetel were with them he knew his poor wife was going to need a bottle of scotch and a tranq gun when she finally got home. If she made it that long without strangling someone. Selene was trying to be good-and had come to him and apologized for sending out the invitations without clearing it with Chaosia- but he knew the woman was too damned . . . . odd to be able to keep to this new behavior. She'd already proved it once . . . And with Sway there to try and keep Chaosia sane while Paul fretted over Jacqueline and 'the bump' . . . He shook his head, glancing to the others as Donnie stepped from the back room and splayed his arms with an easy smile while Memphis laughed. Because Atley was still grumbling to the tailor while Donnie strutted. Sphinx glanced to Toby who shook his head and dug out his phone, recording it to send to the others. And Memphis just continued to cackle . . . Donnie came over, easy going smile in place as he bowed for the camera phone before turning to Sphinx. And he was thankful for the taller boost . . . \"Brother, your girl has taste. I may buy this damned thing for myself. What the hell is Atley bitching about anyway?\" Memphis went to speak as they heard the tailor finally snap and send Atley back into the fitting room as she yelled and threatened him. Which had him very aware that the vein above his eye had started to bloody pulse. Thank God he'd had the foresight to draw out enough from his accounts to bail someone out should things get ugly . . . . Because at this point it was a tie. Sway and Ripley or him and the tailor. Chaosia watched Jacqueline smile over the table at Maetel as Paul rubbed her belly, cooing to the baby as they all sat around the lunch table. This hadn't been anywhere near as bad as she'd thought. Selene had mellowed to a scary point, making both girls worry for her while Sway seemed to be taking notes on everything they did in preparation for her own wedding next year. And now that the dresses were all sized and ready she knew that they had the rest of the day just to relax and as cool as they could be. Monique had left as soon as the fittings were done, having to go run errands before she and Mikhail went out later tonight; and Selene had been impressed with the flighty but sweet girl to a point to where she'd actually been friendly. And Jacqueline had loved having someone else to talk to. She owed her brother's girl friend a cookie basket or something for helping to smooth things over . . . and for not sticking her foot in her mouth again. She sighed, trying to think of how the rest of the day would go. Maetel would be going into work soon and Sway was going to rescue Memphis after they ate, which was going to leave her and Paul to take Selene and Jacqueline with them to the spa. Something that both women were actually looking forward to. Selene because she was 'desperate for a decent massage' and Jacqueline because she wanted to get in as much pampering as possible before they went shopping. Something she was able to do now that the worst of her bruising was gone. Actually, the girl was radiant now that she was surrounded by people who were as happy as she was . . . and that she had been told that Ambrose had signed away his rights while his parents were going to contribute to their grandchild's future. Something that had only taken a few well placed phone calls and one visit from Top and Errol. She grinned, thinking of the picture the brooding enforcer had sent to her phone. Ambrose wasn't ever going to be pretty again. And every single injury he'd cause her sister had been visited against him . . . something that neither of the other women could ever know. Selene because she would be too likely to blab . . . and Jacqueline because she would feel too bad about it. She wasn't at the mad and angry stage of thinking quite yet. But she was eyeing a certain gimpy grumpy boost who loved to meddle in other people's lives. Atley Jackson had stopped by to see Sphinx-and check on Jacqueline but he wasn't admitting it- and it had taken Chaos about six seconds to spot the blush on her cheeks and the shy way of talking. Two things she'd never seen the normally confident and poised girl do. So she'd pulled her aside and they'd talked, her trying to tell her as much about Atley as she dared while the other girl drank the information up. And got even more dreamy eyed before Selene had caught onto it. Selene Strathclyde Guadimus had only two things to say about the whole fiasco before retreating to the study with a bottle of wine and her head held high. \"See what Sphinx and Prometheus think of him . . . and wait until the baby is born before you do anything too stupid. Because I want to see my grandchild.\" She sighed, watching Paul continue to rub Jacqueline's tummy. That was far closer to where it should be now that she was eating right and not stressed. And with the ginger and mint tea Monique of all people had suggested she try to ease the morning sickness. Something that resparked the girl's appetite. \"Yes, you're going to be a good little minion to Uncle Paulie aren't you my pretty? Yes, we're going to wreak havoc and mayhem . . . and look great doing it.\" She laughed, watching Jacqueline light up as Paul reached out and patted her hand. She was glad to see that they were at least getting along . . . because while Sway was being nice she wasn't being too overly friendly. But she'd heard enough horror stories to be weary . . . and she had enough bad experiences of her own. But Jacqueline had yet to be snotty or ill with the blonde boost . . . and Chaosia was more than proud. She reached out, flicking Paul's ear as he yelped. \"Stop rubbing her stomach, Paul. She isn't Buddha . . . And that baby already knows better than to listen to anything your crazy ass says.\" Paul grumbled as he pressed his ear to her stomach, talking to the baby again as Jacqueline and Selene both laughed. \"No! Don't listen my precious! Auntie Chaos is just grumpy because she spends far too much time with Uncle Sphinx. And when they're apart they're both homicidal maniacs. Yes they are. We're not going to be like them are we? No. No we aren't. We're going to be good little nutcases like Mommy and Granny Goodwitch . . . I mean, Grandmother Selene.\" Jacqueline and Chaosia shared a look before they erupted into peels of laughter as Sway choked on her drink. Selene however just sighed and picked up her glass of wine, shaking her head as she took a long drink. \"Go ahead and laugh children. Every evil you have ever committed against me will be paid back through this little one. Mark my words. So it is spoken so shall it be done.\" Sway laughed, shaking her head as she looked to Jacqueline. \"Be afraid. We here in the states call that the Mother's curse. And it works . . . which is why I am personally terrified when you're stepsister here goes to pop out rugrats. I'm going to love them to death but I've known Sphinx for years . . . and she's as bad as he is. Its going to be almost as bad as when Memphis and I have kids.\" Jacqueline smiled at Sway warmly, nodding before she flipped her hair over her shoulder. \"I think it'll be wonderful when they do though . . . Their children are going to be gorgeous . . . and tall if they take after their father.\" Sway nodded while Paul started to go on and on about the wonderful ways their future brood were going to terrorize and rule the world. And as Chaosia dug out her cell phone and read the text she'd been sent, she had a wonderful idea. And a pretty good plan on how to get some of her and Paul's talks about Atley going. Because maybe if he had someone to worry about of his own then they couldn't meddle in her relationship . . . sure they hadn't done it lately . . . but it was far too quiet for her to trust him. Even if she loved him to death . . . \"You guys want to crash the suit fitting? They're still there . . .\" Sphinx had never been so happy to see Chaosia as he was when she waltzed in the doors of the shop, grinning as she twirled the keys to her Aston idly. She waved to the others, crossing to stand in front of him before sinking into his lap with a wink and quick kiss to his cheek. She sighed, leaning into him as he reached up and pulled her closer. God he'd needed this . . . A few seconds later Sway and Selene were through the doors, both shaking their heads before separating to find their respective parties. Sway went to Memphis, grinning as she looked him over in the tux while Selene came to sink into the chair across from them. And rolled her eyes at the sight of Chaosia in his lap. He snorted. He could care less . . . especially with the way her stupidity had almost ruined his matrimony. But when she spoke he felt a bit better. She wasn't rolling her eyes at them . . . this time. \"I swear that boy is too much Chaosia. How do you ever stay out of trouble with him around?\" She shrugged, settling into his side as Jacqueline and Paul came inside, Paul's arm slung over her shoulders as he kept talking to her excitedly. \"But I swear Jackie! The bump is totally telling me that it wants its nursery to be magenta and chartreuse with charcoal and white accents! Chaosia could do it in like five minutes! And everything would be custom and gorgeous . . . And the bump could grow with the room!\" Sphinx looked down at Chaosia as she bit her lip, trying not to laugh as Selene's shoulders sagged. \"Please make it stop, Chaosia. I'll recede ever invitation and let you go back to seventy five guests if you just make it stop.\" Sphinx rolled his eyes but Chaosia perked. And he was suddenly weary of what she was thinking as he caught the glint to her eyes. \"You recent one particular invite and I'll make him shut up for the rest of the day.\" Selene looked her over and nodded once, obviously willing to make the sacrifice as Sphinx glanced up to Chaosia. He'd told her that things were fine . . . but she was apparently going to try and make it better regardless. And if she could accomplish it he would worship her properly as soon as they got home. Hell, as soon as they were alone together. \"Fine. I'll call as soon as he's quiet for five minutes. But the rest of the day Chaosia . . . my nerves and my liver can't take much more of this. Chartreuse and magenta . . . what self respecting nursery wants to be painted those colors? The poor child would develop epilepsy overnight.\" Sphinx choked, trying not to laugh as Chaosia shrugged and called out to Paul. \"Paul?\" He stopped mid sentence and mid-motion, looking like a deer caught in the headlights as he answered her. \"Yes Calamity?\" She however wasn't buying his innocent act. Not one bit . . . she crooked her finger to him and called him over. Which he followed with an exaggerated sigh and sagging shoulders as he glanced back to Jacqueline pitifully. While she laughed and held her stomach. He looked like he was going to the gallows. As soon as he was close, he dipped and Sphinx was suddenly aware that he was stuck for whatever was about to take place. God in heaven help him . . . Chaosia spoke to him softly, not letting anyone else hear her as she bargained with her best friend. And he was suddenly reminded of damned devious she was when she wanted to be. \"Do remember what you said when you first saw him moving me?\" Paul stopped before nodding once and rolling his eyes. \"Yeppers peppers. What, you find one in the woodwork or something?\" She nodded, leaning in closer. \"Younger, hot and sarcastic to boot . . . with pretty blue eyes.\" Paul stilled, eyeing her skeptically before shaking his head after looking at him. And he wondered what he'd happened upon here . . . \"No way sweetheart. Men that look and act like that don't swing my way. At least not openly . . .\" She winked before shrugging, settling against him again as she waggled her eyebrows. \"I've met him and never once seen him with a girl . . . And he's only thirty two . . . So he's still older than you.\" Sphinx paled, realizing who and what they were talking about but as she reached over and pinched him he knew to stay quiet. Especially with the look Paul had taken on. \"Could just be weird. They are related . . . but it would be fun to harass him either way. Why? What do you want?\" She leaned in, almost begging. \"No more spazoid for the rest of the day okay? Actually no more talking. Or Selene isn't going to call and do what I need her to . . . Please? For me?\" He leaned back, arms crossed before he extended his hand to her. \"I get full reign as soon as he's stateside regardless of affiliation . . . and you owe me a box of those truffles. And we do movie night in the media room tomorrow and teach Jackie about good ol' American horror movies. Deal?\" Chaosia nodded, shaking his hand once hard before he turned on his heel and marched back to Jacqueline. He leaned and whispered and the girl laughed but nodded, moving to sit with him on the sofa across from the chairs. Right as Atley marched out of the back still in his tux and fuming. Chaosia looked to Atley before grinning, leaning over the back of the chair to rag on him as Sphinx watched Jacqueline watch his best friend. Well damnation, his girl was right. As usual. The strawberry blonde watched Jackson with blushing cheeks, her eyes never leaving him for long as he argued with his future wife. And when Paul nudged her and motioned to her silently he knew that the man was already on point trying to play matchmaker. Despite Chaosia's decision to just leave it be and run its course. But Paul would only act under her orders . . . what game was his wife playing at here? \"Oh Atley! You look so good! But you need to let them take up the pants just a bit more . . .\" Atley glared, shaking his head. His leg hurt, he was tired and he needed a damned drink. And the girl's brothers were infuriating. Mikhail was trying to be good but Bastian was a snob and a half. And if he spoke one more time he wasn't going to be responsible for his actions. He could only take so damned much . . . \"They've stuck and prodded me enough for one damned day. And your brothers are about to die if they make one more short crack. Everyone in the fucking world isn't over six feet tall. And I can still climb their crazy asses to kick them. Especially that oldest brat.\" Chaosia laughed, reaching out and patting his hand before they both turned to Jacqueline as she spoke. He stopped, looking her over almost in a daze. He really hadn't seen her much since she'd healed . . . and it was like looking at a completely different person. Before she was pretty, even covered in bruises and scared. Actually she'd been too damned scared to look at him. But now . . . now she was gorgeous. And he suddenly understood more of Tumbler's ramblings. Her hair was styled in soft waves around her face, her cheeks rosy and full against her peaches-and-cream complexion. But it was the way she smiled at him that made his heart do odd things. She practically glowed at him as she smiled up at him softly, her lilting voice carrying even over the other noise of the shop. And he suddenly knew what Sphinx had felt like when Chaosia doused him in coffee. This was unexpected . . . . and very unhealthy for both of them. But try as he might he couldn't take his eyes off of her. And she seemed content to smile and blush up at him. Whatever had changed because she wasn't afraid to look at him now. \"I think it looks nice, Atley. Very dashing . . . and don't let Bastian bother you. We generally ignore him.\" He nodded to her, hand going to try to smooth the back of his hair. Because it always seemed to stand on end whenever he was this frazzled. He shifted, looking to the younger girl. Who was still glowing up at him sweetly. \"You think so? It isn't too . . . shiny?\" She laughed, shaking her head as she stood. And he belatedly noticed that she was dressed in a flowing silk shell with one of Chaosia's million cashmere sweater wraps over her shoulders, the cream of the under shirt and the pale pink of the wrap looking good against her dark jeans and sandaled feet. But nowhere near as good as her smile and rosy cheeks. She crossed to him, smoothing the lapel before straightening his collar. And he had to remember to breathe in normally as he caught a whiff of the perfume she was wearing. He'd smelled it on Chaosia a million times but it seemed . . . more robust and noticeable on the other girl. But now that she was closer he could see the tell-tale bump beneath the silk and cashmere . . . and instead of being put off by it he just looked at it like another part of her. What in the hell was going on here? \"The only reason its shiny is because it's a silk blend . . . which means it won't be as hot or heavy. And the sheen will look good against our bridesmaid dresses. Trust me, you look . . . nice. But let me fix your collar. There . . . Better?\" He nodded, looking down before looking back up to her. She was a tiny little thing . . . carrying another tiny little thing. \"Yeah. You doing okay?\" She smiled, blushing even darker before nodding and brushing her hair out of her face almost bashfully. And he suddenly wanted to cup her cheek or just touch her. To make sure she was okay. But why? \"Yeah . . . everyone's been so great. All of your friends especially.\" Atley nodded, remembering Tumbler and almost frowning. God why did the kid have to notice her . . . why was he noticing her? He went to speak as a loud squawk sounded from the back room just in time for Bastian to come tumbling out of the back with Mikhail practically wrapped around his middle, tackling the other man to the ground hard. He moved, pulling Jacqueline behind him as Sphinx stood quickly with a growl. And Jacqueline gasped as he turned back to her. \"Are you okay, girl?\" She nodded, blushing before she leaned up and whispered. And Atley knew he was in trouble when her lips brushing his ear sent shivers through him. Even as her words made him cringe. \"I'm fine . . . but they're not about to be. Sphinx just dumped Chaosia into the floor. And she isn't too happy about it.\" Atley turned, looking at Chaosia as she glowered up at Sphinx. Who looked torn between laughing and running before he settled for going to separate the squabbling boys. He grabbed Mikhail by the sleeve of his shirt, tossing him back before he caught Bastian by the collar and hoisted him off the ground. And even though the boy was close to his size, Sphinx dangled him off the ground as the others all watched. \"By God, what did I say before we got here? Be have or I was going to skin both of you . . .\" Atley watched Bastian pale as Mikhail slumped back into the mirror he'd been thrown at. But Chaosia was still pissed . . . and glaring between the three of them before shaking her head. \"You are all going to apologize for this crap or so help me every single one of you will paint and wall paper and plant and weed until Doomsday! You understand?\" All three men cringed, Sphinx easing the boy to the ground as they all nodded. And finally Selene chose that moment to pipe up, chuckling as she shook her head before turning to Sway. Who was trying not to laugh. \"You were right my dear. God in heaven help them when they have children. Because the worst thing is going to be when they're more like her than him . . .\" Atley laughed, shaking his head before turning back to see Jacqueline turning away with a dark blush. Christ what in the hell did he do now? Sphinx groaned, flopping into the bed beside Chaosia as she stretched out before sitting his head in her lap. She'd changed into a pair of her sweats-with the legs pushed up of course- and a tank top and her hair was down and wild as she sighed and glanced down at him. He knew she was elated to be done with school . . . and she'd finally gotten her diploma. And though he was upset that she had chosen not to walk with all of the drama going on she'd sworn that she was fine with it . . . Now they just needed to make it to May and he might be able to breathe easier. He reached up, cupping her face to bring her lips down to his. She smiled rakishly, ghosting her own over his before going to slash them against his hungrily . . . only to be interrupted by the damned phone ringing. He hated phones most days . . . and today was proving to be no different. She sighed pitifully, pulling away to answer it as he settled against her. He leaned over, kissing her stomach before he sighed and closed his eyes as her fingers started threading through his hair. He listened, trying to see who she was talking to . . . and who to kill when he saw them tomorrow. Because only a few people were brave enough to call them after dark . . . and they would all be present when they went to check on the venue for the wedding. Chaosia had insisted that their vows weren't even a month away and she needed to go and do a final walk through. Before they started decorating next week. He snorted, shaking his head in her lap as her fingers stilled. They had exactly three weeks until they were to be married. And two and a half before the favored members of her family started to roll in. Which meant he'd been right to go ahead and use as much of his vacation time as possible. He'd bank almost two months with all of the doubles and the excess he had stored back . . . but he knew by time for them to leave to go on their honeymoon he was going to be chomping at the bit to either go back to work or boost. Which is probably why Chaosia had encouraged him to take as many as he could while the others would be here . . . and refused to let anyone stay with them unless absolutely necessary. Her voice broke him out of his thoughts and he opened his eyes, glancing up as she sighed and pulled the phone away to glance at. Before shaking her head with a perplexed expression . . . and telling him who to skin tomorrow. Of course it was Paul . . . \"Yes Paul, I was serious. Look, I have another call. No I'm not going to ignore it- It's a British number jackass. Meaning its probably my uncle. I've got to go.\" She shook her head, hitting the button to transfer as she dipped to kiss him and giggled when he nipped at her lips. He might not ever admit aloud but he was spoiled luck bastard . . . and she made sure he was happy. Something he'd never thought possible to the extent he had now. \"Hello?\" She stilled, every muscle in her body stiffening as she clutched the phone tighter and he rolled, moving to sit up as he looked her over. She looked to him panicked before shaking her head and answering whoever had called. Because he knew it wasn't her Uncle. \"I . . . I don't know . . . Hold on.\" She covered the phone, looking to him as she practically chewed on her bottom lip before speaking softly. And he could see how anxious she was. Who the hell was on the phone now? \"It's Augustus. Selene called and did what I asked but he called Bastian to get my-our number. He wanted to know if he was still allowed to come and visit . . . because apparently Bastian has invited him to spend sometime in the states. But he says he understands with all of the stuff going on if we just wanted to wait . . . What do I say?\" Sphinx looked at the phone intensely before sighing and holding out his hand for it. She looked uncertain but handed it to him . . . and jumped when he kissed her before melting into him. She leaned into him, eyes boring into his as she whispered to him. \"This is your thing, honey. Your . . . pain. And I will stand with whatever decision you make. I love you . . . you just do what you need to do to be okay . . .\" He sighed, nodding as he took the phone and brought it to his ear. And heard a voice that very closely mimicked his own . . . save being just a tad lighter and with a thicker accent. He felt his heart stop for a second. He hadn't spoken to Augustus since he was a child . . . and why he'd expected to still hear that same high pitched voice calling out to him he didn't know. He shook his head, speaking into the phone as Chaosia leaned into him and wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Hello?\" \" Who is this? Chaosia said to hold . . .\" He sighed, shaking his head as he heard the brash side of their heritage rear its head. Their father had always been a cold, blunt man . . . and both of them had apparently taken a good portion of his severe nature. \"She did, boy-o. I asked for the phone. You wanted to know if you were welcomed?\" The silence on the other end of the line was unnerving . . . but as he heard the man speak again he could hear he was just as bothered. And very, very sarcastic . . . just like fucking Celeste had been. Oh this wasn't going to end well. Not at all. \" Well, if it isn't too much of a bother . . . I mean it is rather odd for someone to receive an invitation then get told they can't attend. Especially when their family crest is on the bloody writ. How are we related after all? I don't have any family left . . . not that would claim the crest anyway.\" Sphinx ground his teeth, trying not to snap at the bait before taking a deep breathe as Chaosia reached up and kissed under his chin. He looked down and he knew that despite what she told him, she really did want him to make peace eventually. Well, she would get it . . . or she could help him bury the damned body if he killed him. \"it was mine to claim boy . . . and has been for years. Besides, that wasn't exactly my concern when the bloody things went out.\" The man laughed and Sphinx felt himself bristle . . . until he spoke again and he was tempted to laugh with him. What in the hell? \" Oh I figured as much . . . I've know the Guadimus family for years and Chaosia is very set on getting her way. So is Selene the bloody harpy. But seeing as in Chaosia loathes propriety almost as much as I do I would hazard that Selene is the culprit . . . and that Chaosia is trying to make peace after she started a war.\" Sphinx nodded, feeling asinine for doing so before he spoke, easing up as Chaosia's lips found his neck and moved up to his jaw. \"That's about the size of it. You're welcomed if you want to be. We aren't in the habit of turning family away . . .\" Augustus blinked, knowing now that he really was talking to his brother. He was actually talking to Ignatius . . . and he would see him. For the first time since he was . . . God, a toddler. He sank into the seat behind his desk, glancing around his office dazedly. He'd never known why his brother had left after their father had died . . . he'd been too small to even comprehend . . . And it had taken him years to find the old but unopened letters from the squalors of London-and the later California- before he'd begun to wonder about the truth to what his mother swore. She'd always claimed that he'd run out on them, abandoning them to deal with an Estate-one of the wealthiest and more influential- while he went off to do whatever. Leaving him alone with his mother and her power hungry ways . . . He was the first to admit that he'd been bitter but now he was just numb to it. He'd learned that family and nobility didn't mean anything. They weren't worth the paper the crests were printed on . . . or the blood that they were linked by. But now, to hear him say that . . . he had to wonder just what his mother had done. He'd always known that if Ignatius ever popped back up then his seat was forfeit, despite every string his mother had tried to pull. Including trying to have their father's marriage to his first wife declared void posthumously. He'd never told her but he hadn't ever tried to pursue it the way she wanted. Because he didn't want to be a Lord . . . that was her dream. And it had made him bitter at his brother all over again for him to have it. He cleared his throat, trying to think of what to say to that that wouldn't seem . . . fake or condescending. He'd been a baby when all of this had happened . . . but he was still going to have to pay the price for it apparently. The sins of his mother and father had cut too deep for the man across the Atlantic to be satisfied with a few simple words. \"Then I'll see you in a week's time. Bastian seems to believe that your future wife's brother . . . Mikhail I think it is . . . is going to slaughter him if he doesn't have someone to help keep him entertained.\" Augustus listened to the man chuckle darkly and he had to wonder when his brother's laugh had gotten so sinister. He remembered Ignatius laughing with him as he'd toss him about and let him climb all over him. He'd never been very talkative but he'd always laughed with him. And what he just heard wasn't his brother . . . . \" Mikhail is going to gut him . . . but more for continuing to cause Chaos grief. A fair warning for when you're stateside . . .\" He smirked, catching the underlying threat. Her brother wouldn't be the only one gutting people if they stepped out of line. And he suddenly knew that whatever he'd become Ignatius was dangerous. And very, very serious about keeping Chaosia out of any stress. \"I gathered as much. Bastian can be daft to be so damned intelligent . . . And I hope to actually be able to carry on a conversation with the two of you . . . but we'll see what happens. I'll let you return to your evening. Tell Chaosia I said goodnight . . . And Ignatius?\" He heard the line get deathly quiet and he wondered if he'd made a mistake. That this wasn't his brother and just some long lost cousin being forced into displaying the family crest against their will. But when he spoke again he knew he'd been right. And that he definitely needed to know what happened between his family before he went Stateside. \" Sphinx, boy. I haven't been called that in a long time. And regardless of our . . . relation you aren't going to do it either.\" He paled, trying not to bristle as he consented. \"Sorry, Sphinx then. I am looking forward to meeting you . . . Good night.\" And with that he hung up before the man could speak again before sagging back into his seat. He glanced around the office before trying to figure out where to start looking. And we finally get to see more of Augustus. Who my sister-after seeing the sketches I made for each character while we were waiting around for my Dad to get back from tests- said would be portrayed wonderfully by Karl Urban. I don't really see it but she swears it would be good. And she won't leave me alone until I put it out there for everyone else to see. So there brat. Its up.[Chapter 46] Thanks for all of the reviews and the well wishing, guys. It really does mean the world to me and my family. And on to the new chapter. Foot in Mouth Introductions Chaosia moved through the largest guest room, trying to get the thing as clean and pristine as possible. Because-despite what her insane fiancé claimed- everything had to be perfect. She had less than three weeks before she and Sphinx got married, the world was beginning to settle and she could practically taste the upcoming apocalypse around the corner. Because their lives didn't go this well . . . The Le Palais d' Anges was ready and waiting, the famed three level French Palladian residential estate ready to house the almost three hundred guests that would be pouring into the area within the next few weeks . . . and she was thrilled that the place had met everyone's damned requirements. The delicate hand carved imported limestone exterior, onyx marbles, marble columns, antique mirrors and the exceptional French moldings with 24karat gilt had been major selling points for Selene and Jacqueline while her father and the others had been happy with the sprawling gardens and the fully stocked bars. And once it was fully decorated-which was probably going to take a full two weeks even with the crew the wedding coordinator Sphinx and her father had all but forced down her throat had in place to begin- it would be absolutely gorgeous. The perfect place for them to get married . . . Oh who was she kidding? It was the perfect place for Jacqueline or any other couple to tie the knot. But for her and Sphinx it was going to look pretentious . . . but her brain damaged fiancé was damned adamant about making sure that they kept to what would make life easiest. And with the way that both of their families-God that was an odd thought-seemed to gravitate towards the larger scales of throwing events in London he wasn't 'going to argue over anything that would possibly embarrass her'. And she both loved and hated him for it. She sighed, looking over the room before shaking her head again. It was perfect . . . and ready for the biggest surprise of their upcoming ceremony. Sphinx had-once Augustus had called- plainly invited the man. And when she'd talked to her father the next day, Sphinx had spoken up and openly refused his offer to house the pop-up guest. She'd thought he was crazy . . . until he'd explained later that he wasn't going to let anyone or anything destroy her happiness. And the best way to keep that from happening was to keep the two biggest potential trouble makers –Bastian because of his attitude and Augustus just because of how volatile their whole situation was- separate and under almost constant supervision. So her future . . . brother-in-law was going to be staying with them until the wedding. In their new house . . . with her future husband who probably wasn't going to be able to be in the same damned room with him unsupervised. Which meant she was going to be damned babysitting on top of everything else she was doing. Because no matter what they claimed she wasn't turning Selene and that damned she-devil they'd hired lose without some sort of high powered weapon to take them out. God knows that if either had it their way this wedding would be an even bigger circus than it already was shaping up to be . . . At least her grandmother was in-bound soon. Meaning the matriarch of the Guadimus family could handle wrangling the bullshit bound to pop up until she became a Dashell. She shook her head, going into the bathroom to make sure that it was still stocked before she called Paul. They were going to meet Sphinx at the garage as soon as they called . . . and she was going to trade him back his Malibu for her Aston. Now she just hoped that her father and Sphinx did okay picking the man up at the airport . . . Prometheus watched his future son-in-law as they waited for Augustus's plane to touch down. And he had to admit that even if he was nervous or anxious-and honestly only an idiot wouldn't be considering what was going on- the man seemed the picture of calm and collected. Until you noticed the slight ticking above his left eye . . . but Chaosia had warned him that would happen with the crowds. Because her future husband was about as good as them as she was. But he was sure that Sphinx wasn't going to start pushing people into lakes to get out of them the way his daughter had when she was younger . . . He shook his head, shifting on his feet as Sphinx turned to look at him. He nodded to the man before chuckling at the way his face flashed when they announced the arrival of the flight from London. He had never even suspected that the man before him was a member of the nobility . . . much less a Dashell. But that just went to show that not everyone wore their scars and affiliations out for the world to see. Hell, if half of the bloody 'elite' knew what he'd done for the years he'd been estranged from his family-before he'd come to the States and met Millennia- then they would never grace his house as easily as they did. But it was odd to think that the man his daughter was marrying had walked away from a Lordship. And obviously had no intentions of ever trying to reclaim it . . . Not that he blamed him. It was a bloody nightmare . . . and he knew that to be friends with Mikhail that the man had some sort of illegal lifestyle-or had at one point. Something that would have to go the wayside if he took his seat. He grumbled, wishing he could pull another cigarette from his pocket but knew the damned workers would just glare at him. Again. God this is why he hated to be in California too long. Bloody anti-smoking legislation . . . Sphinx shifted, moving forward to see who was disembarking the flight. And Prometheus suddenly wondered if Chaosia had dressed him before she'd let him leave . . . because he doubted the man-who's tendencies towards darker colors and layers was almost ridiculous- would have willing worn the well fitting dark washed jeans and the bone white oxford shirt (though he had the sleeves cuffed to showcase his tattoos and the watch he wore more often than not). And he knew the man had to be forced into the matte leather belt and the black Steve Madden's . . . and the black blazer tossed over the seat beside them. He tried not to chuckle as he shook his head. At least she hadn't tried to put him in the sweater Selene and Jacqueline had sworn would look wonderful on him. He shuddered. He didn't care if it was Dolce and Gabbana or if it had cost almost a thousand damn dollars. The crew necked monstrosity was an abomination rendered in pastel cashmere . . . and he was going to give it Mikhail for some horrible accident to befall it. Like being set on fire in the back yard . . . after it was run over a few times. That could be accidental, right? He shook himself, looking over Sphinx stepped forward . . . right as Augustus Dashell stepped through the horde of other people with an expression Prometheus had seen more than a few times on the eldest brother's face since they'd been in the airport. Apparently a dislike of people in general was a family trait . . . He watched Sphinx straighten as Augustus noticed him . . . and the look that passed across the younger Lord's face was one so dazed he almost felt sorry for him. He was apparently as out of sorts over this as Sphinx was . . . but he wasn't quite as good as hiding it as his . . . brother. Augustus seemed to shake himself as he nodded to Sphinx, turning from the man to extend his hand to him with a hesitant smile. One he returned, fully aware that both were keeping close tabs on the other even though they were trying not to look like it. God they were going to kill one another . . . if Chaosia didn't kill them first. He turned, clapping his hands together and rubbing them lazily as he tried not to laugh at the way both jumped at the unexpected nose. Oh this was far too tempting for him to be here unsupervised . . . and suddenly Chaosia's decree that neither Atley or Mikhail were allowed made so much more sense than it had before. His daughter was getting more like her mother every damned day. And spoiling his fun even more . . . because Sphinx's inability to let her actually complete a damned brawl was falling as a failure in her slot. Well, he could still have his fun . . . and blame her for it. \"Alright boys. Lets get going . . . Chaosia wants us to get you settled at the house and then we're to meet them for lunch.\" Sphinx's face turned dangerously dark at the pop-up plan while Augustus raised a brow, shifting his carry-on from one shoulder to the other. The man was in a damned dark French brown suit with a bone colored dress shirt and a black tie. He'd have to change before they went and did anything . . . but they were going to do something. And his daughter wasn't getting her Aston back until after he'd had his fun. \"Why would she want me to get settled? I'm staying with you . . . Bastian even said so earlier this week when we spoke . . . .\" Prometheus grinned, shaking his head as he chuckled. God this was going to be fun . . . \"Sorry, lad. But there's been a change in plans. Chaosia and Sphinx have the room to put you up while you're here . . . and I have a very large list of people to accommodate thanks to my loving wife. So I'm shipping you to your brother here and we're all going to get along. Or you'll probably experience my little girl's wrath full on.\" The youngest shook his head, waving his hand as he looked between them. And Prometheus watched Sphinx's face darken even more as the man spoke. Damnation was he daft? \"With all due respect but that would be far too awkward . . . I mean, surely they resent being used as a bloody hotel because of your wife's monster guest list . . .\" Sphinx snorted, rolling his eyes before turning and stalking towards the main commons. And Prometheus knew that the man had just pissed him off proper. Chaosia was going to kill them . . . and then she was going to kill him. He could already see it. He reached into his coat, pulling out the cloves and brought one to his lips; lighting it even as the worker gaped at him. He didn't bloody care. He was on his way out anyway . . . He turned to Augustus and shook his head. \"They aren't averse to it at all, boy. Because it was their idea . . . though I'm pretty sure with that,\" he motioned his head to the way his son-in-law had just gone \"it was more his than hers. So just keep your mouth shut-for once- and do as you're told. At least until I don't have to deal with the consequences . . .\" Augustus opened his mouth before sighing and nodding once, shifting his bag again as he motioned for them to lead the way. And Prometheus could practically taste the sarcastic quip the man was choking back. But he needed to get in that habit. Because while Chaosia was tolerant of it-hell the few times they'd had to be together she'd offered her own- and Bastian loved to egg him on, Sphinx wasn't going to deal with it. And he would beat the man into submission if he overstepped his bounds. Then again, maybe a fist fight is exactly what they needed to clear the air between them . . . he shook his head. It wouldn't work. Hell, it never had for Mikhail and Bastian . . . and they'd been around one another more than these two had. God let the upcoming weeks pass quickly . . . Sphinx fought grinding his teeth as he made his way to the Aston, trying not to snap at his future wife on the phone. He'd known he was supposed to bring the car to her at the garage . . . and lunch wasn't too bad of an idea-his grumbling stomach attested to that- but she honestly just needed to tell him some things before she made plans. Like letting Paul layer even more gold and caramel into her chocolate curls while they waited . . . making it almost completely blonde. He sighed, stopping in front of the car to pinch the bridge of his nose. She was going to be the death of him . . . if he didn't go away for killing the ungrateful whelp he'd just met first. \"I'm sure your hair looks fine, Chaosia. But why didn't you tell me we were going to bloody lunch?\" Silence met him and he thought she'd hung up until he heard rustling. And her words just made him that decide that a father-in-law wasn't entirely necessary. Hell, Otto could walk her down the bloody aisle. He took a deep breath. He needed to stay calm . . . because as soon as the sun went down he was going to call Atley and they were going to grab the fastest car he possibly could and he was going to drive into the fucking concrete. And then he was going to come home and soak in that monster tub with his wife. \" I didn't say to go to lunch . . . I figured you'd want to get away as quick as possible. Augustus is a sarcastic smart ass when he's nervous or bored . . . And after a flight from London to met you for the first time in like forever . . . well I guessed as little exposure as necessary was the safest way. Why? Are we going to lunch?\" He rolled his eyes before going to the door, getting in and leaning back into the bone white seat as he closed his eyes. \"Apparently. Your father just announced that we were settling him in and going . . . Do you have the Malibu or do you need to go get it?\" \" She's sitting outside waiting right now . . . with a full tank of gas-courtesy of Paul- should you have to make a quick escape.\" He chuckled, shaking his head as he reached out to crank the car. He needed to remember to not glare at her best friend for that . . . the man was nerve racking but he was trying to make this as easy on them as possible. And with the way he had single handedly taken Jacqueline under his proverbial wing- and kept to aggravating Selene as retribution for her foul treatment of his friend for years, despite her current good behavior- he was making it a hell of a lot easier. Now if the rest of the world would just follow his lead. \"I appreciate that . . . because it may happen. I have no bloody clue what I was thinking when I suggested this . . . but I need to go ahead and sodding shoot myself and be done with it.\" Her light giggle floated through the phone and he felt himself start to calm down, leaving him amazed at how she could do that across the damned county. \" I hope you don't. I would miss you too much . . . Besides, we kind of have this thing we're supposed to do in a couple of weeks. I'm not sure but I remember it being kind of a big deal . . . I bought a new dress and everything . . .\" He chuckled, grinning as she joked. And he couldn't help picking back at her. \"Oh really? Guess I'll have to postpone then . . . I'd hate to upset your plans . . . Tell me, since you won't let me see it, is it a pretty dress?\" She huffed but he could hear her grin in her voice. \" All of my dresses are pretty. But Sway helped pick it out if that helps . . .\" He groaned, remembering the last dress Wayland had picked. He'd been overly fond of that one . . . \"Then I'll definitely be there. I'll be up front in the bloody monkey suit . . .\" \" It's a date, Mr. Sphinx. I'll see you there. Four o'clock on the 28 th . . . Don't be late.\" \"Wouldn't dream of it, Love.\" She giggled again and her voice softened enough to make his smile come back. \" I love you, Sphinx . . .\" And even though her idea to elope wasn't suddenly sounding so damned bad . . . he knew they needed to do this right. He'd managed to bugger everything in their relationship so far-by either accident, ignorance or just plain out refusal to compromise- and he wasn't going to let this fall prey to that tendency. He might not be able to be everything she always wanted . . . but he would give her the damned wedding they needed to have peace. Even if it meant making peace with the man that had just pretty much snubbed his attempt at being . . . he shook himself. He had enough family. And the blood relation he shared with the man inside was apparently going to be pretty limited. But with who he came from how could it be anything but? Celeste had always hated him . . . and it didn't surprise him that after she'd all but banished him from their household upon marrying his father that Augustus would fall into the same habit. Chaosia seemed to pick up on his train of thought. \" Are you okay, baby? It hasn't been that bad . . . has it?\" He sighed, running a hand down his face before resituating the phone where he could pull out of the spot. He needed to get his head together and go get his father-in-law and his . . . guest. Before Guadimus got them in anymore damned trouble than he already had. He'd already almost gotten them kicked out for smoking twice . . . \"Oh between Augustus pretty much voicing his distaste for staying with us and your father almost getting us banned from the bloody terminal its been fine. A real cakewalk . . .\" She groaned and he heard Paul pipe up in the back ground before she shushed him. \" I am so sorry. I thought I hid all of his damned cigarettes yesterday . . . but apparently we missed a pack. Would me promising to hit him at lunch make it any better?\" He chuckled, waiting to pull out of the parking complex as a line of cars went by. And he knew she would live up to it if she promised him she would . . . but he needed to keep peace. Now he might let her ht the whelp . . . \"Not necessary, Love. But I know another way you could make it up to me later . . .\" \" Oh really? And what would that be?\" He grinned, pulling out and navigating towards the doors to wait on the other two. Hopefully Guadimus would prove useful for once and stay inside long enough for this particular conversation. Because he doubted the man wanted to hear his plans for his daughter . . . \"Well, it involves us and that wonderful tub we have . . . and pretty much leads to that monstrosity masquerading as a bed that you bought . . .\" He heard her moan before a loud smack echoed through the phone and a yelp. Letting him know that Paul had said or done something to get hit. At least it wasn't him . . . \" That sounds absolutely wonderful, baby. I can't wait. Look, let me go because I have to go change now that we're not just staying around the garage. I know you love me in my jeans and tee shirts but I doubt Augustus's heart can take the stress . . .\" He looked over, seeing Guadimus leading Augustus out and rolled his eyes at the bags the two were carrying. The boy had seriously packed enough for a year . . . not three bloody weeks. He sighed, rolling his eyes as he popped the trunk. God he just wanted to get away . . . maybe Chaosia could go on his little ride with him instead of Atley . . . He shook himself. There was no way she was ever going anywhere near anything boost related unless she had to. \"Oh? What are you wearing?\" She giggled, her voice dropping as she picked with him. And even though he knew she was joking it was still enough to make his blood simmer. She had to stop doing shit like this or they weren't going to make it to their wedding day. He was going to keep her in bed for the rest of their bloody lives. \" Oh nothing . . . just the Chevelle tee shirt and your favorite jeans . . .\" He groaned, nodding back to Guadimus as the man motioned to the trunk. He had to get off the phone. Now. Because he knew exactly what she was talking about. The faded green Chevelle baby doll tee shirt was skin tight . . . and left a good portion of her stomach-which was tanned and toned in preparation for their nuptials- bare. While the jeans were more hole than fabric and fit like they were painted on. She was trying to kill him . . . he just knew it . . . \"Go home and change. We'll meet you there. And please put on something that covers. I'd have to kill him if he looked at you . . . The others know better.\" She laughed in his ear as the doors opened and the other two piled in, Augustus sinking gracefully and quietly into the back seat while Guadimus dropped like dead weight; grousing as he pulled out another cigar. Chaosia heard him and spoke up again. \" I love you, baby. Let me talk to Daddy really quick before you hang up, okay?\" He smirked, shaking his head. \"Love you too . . . Here.\" Guadimus looked to the phone before rolling his eyes, lighting the cigarette as he spoke. And lying through his teeth as he flicked his lighter closed. \"Yes honey, everything is fine. No Chaosia, I know not to smoke in the car . . . yes duckie. Even with the windows down. I know. I know. Well, I figured you'd want to eat . . . and you did mention-No Chaosia, I didn't- Damnation, child. Fine. We'll meet you at the house. I love you too, sweetheart. But you're just as crazy as your mother was . . . I know you don't see anything wrong with that. But I'm more than positive your husband will . . .\" He pulled the phone away before looking to him in shock. \"The brat bloody hung up on me!\" \"I wonder why?\" Sphinx looked back at Augustus darkly while the man actually blushed before Guadimus laughed. And continued to smoke even after he'd said he wasn't. he sighed, rolling his eyes before pulling off and into traffic . . . loving the way that the man in the backseat paled as the car accelerated well past the speed limit once they were clear of the majority of the cars. He shook his head, switching lanes as Guadimus smoked calmly beside him while Augustus flinched when they came a bit closer to the back end of the truck beside them than absolutely necessary. He grinned, moving ahead and shooting around the other two transfer trucks before zipping in between them to speed up the off ramp. He really didn't need to take this particular exit but he could navigate to the house a bit easier . . . and it would take them through downtown to allow Chaosia the time she needed to change. And watching the man in the backseat turn the color of the seats was too damned tempting. \"Is it necessary to drive like that? Honestly?\" Guadimus laughed, tossing his cigarette out the window before glancing back at their passenger. He'd driven worse on the way here and the older Lord had been fine . . . and that he'd been the one to teach both Mikhail and Chaosia to damned drive. \"Oh lighten up, Augustus. It's the bloody States, man. You don't have to act like we're in Britain. And Chaosia drives worse than he does . . .\" Sphinx nodded when the man looked to him before taking the turn onto Ocean a little faster than he should have. But the yelp from the back was too damned funny for him to regret it. Even if the car had come off of two of its wheels for a few seconds. It wasn't like he hadn't done worse. \"And you let her drive? I knew she was crazy but . . . \" Guadimus laughed, shaking his head as they turned onto E Livingston and made their way to Quincy . . . they had a few more minutes. And he had a hell of a turn to take up ahead . . . might as well enjoy it while he could. Right? Chaosia looked to Paul as they heard the garage door open a few seconds before the squeal of brakes. And both rolled their eyes. Paul didn't even bother to move from his spot on the bed as she turned back to the mirror, trying to smooth out the shirt over the skinny jeans she'd pulled from the top of her closet. The jeans were a sand wash and ultra soft . . . and even though they looked like they were painted on they still managed to seem casual. And with the cap sleeved shirt she was sure she knew it looked good enough for the impromptu lunch. The soft jersey shirt had broad horizontal stripes of navy against cream that stayed straight they reached the neckline twirl, dipping just enough to show her collarbone and shoulders as it made an intricate knot. That coupled with her necklace and the cute little navy satin flats-and the rings she never took off-would meet her husband's approval. Hopefully anyway . . . She glanced back to Paul, watching him thumb through the magazine he'd picked up lazily. She shook her head, moving to go meet them as she heard the door open and close a little harder than it should have. \"Oh please, don't get up on my account, Hickok.\" He shrugged, never looking up as he commented. And she was suddenly tempted to pelt him with something . . . the jack ass. \"Hadn't planned on it Calamity. Let me know how it all plays out . . .\" She rolled her eyes, opening the bedroom door and moving out and into the main portion of the house. She moved through the living room, checking everything as she went through before passing into the dining room to go to the kitchen. Selene had loved the way this particular room had turned out-much to her father's chagrin-and insisted to know what wallpaper she used. She grinned, shaking her head as she stepped into the kitchen . . . and spotted her future husband moving through the hallway with what looked like a million bags over his shoulders and in his hands. While her father leaned against her counter and drained a bottle of beer as quickly as he could. She crossed her arms, tapping her foot as her father turned and spotted her. He put down the almost empty bottle, grinning as he reached out and ran a hand through her now dark blonde curls before cupping her cheek. \"I can't believe it's back to that color . . . you've kept it dark so long I'd almost forgotten you're blonde like your grandmother . . .\" She blushed, flipping her hair over her shoulder as she stepped away from him. And right into Sphinx as he stepped closer to her. She smiled up at him, letting him sit the bags down before she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. He dipped, pressing his forehead to hers as his hands moved' one cupping her face while the other pulled her into him and settled on the small of her back. She stretched up, pressing her lips against his quickly before pulling away. And she knew from the look that passed through his eyes that she was definitely going to pay for that later . . . but she could see he needed the little gesture even if he didn't want to admit it. He tugged her closer, running his nose along hers before speaking. \"I have to admit I like the color . . . but what is this I hear about being this way naturally then?\" She blushed, shrugging before she winked at him. \"It was blonde when I was little . . . but I've kept it dark for years. Because it turned, just like my Mom's did . . . Weird genes, you know? So . . . where's our company?\" Sphinx went to speak when a voice sounded behind him, and she had to admit that even though they were half brothers the only thing the two of them shared were broad shoulders and being tall. She let Sphinx move to her side, leaning into him as she smiled as brightly as she could to her future brother-in-law. Or was he a half-brother-in-law? Augustus smirked back to her, nodding as he dropped another load of bags at her feet. And she had to wonder how much he'd packed . . . but then again she packed more so she couldn't say anything. And everyone wasn't as Spartan in their clothing habits as her future hubby. \"Right behind you . . . Its good to see you again Chaosia. But what on earth have you done to your hair now?\" She laughed, shaking her head before leaning even further into Sphinx as she felt him tense. She leaned over and kissed the coiling muscle on the side of his neck, trying to will him to unclench his teeth. Or the fucking dentist was going to have a field day. He'd already chipped a damned tooth a few months back with all the grinding he did . . . and she wasn't going to force his ass back to the dentist until next year. \"Well I figured there were going to be enough brunettes at the wedding . . . and haven't you heard? Blondes have more fun.\" Augustus rolled his eyes but nodded, not wanting to get into it with her. Because he knew he would lose. She pulled away from Sphinx, stretching up to kiss his cheek before motioning to both to follow her. \"C'mon boys, let's get you settled. You can change to go get lunch if you want to . . .\" Augustus looked down at his clothes before looking back up at her with a brow raised skeptically. Had he seriously worn a damned suit to fly in? Seriously? \"And why pray tell do I need to change?\" She grinned, winking to Sphinx before turning to her father. \"I was thinking about going to the Penguin . . . Daddy wanted to try it out since they're Stateside for a while. And we all know Selene wouldn't be caught dead there . . .\" Her father grinned, looking at her hopefully. \"That means I can smoke, right?\" She rolled her eyes before nodding. And had to fight laughing as he looked skyward, lips moving in what she could only guess was a prayer. As she went to take both of the others to the guest bedroom though she couldn't help aggravating him. \"Like you didn't do enough of that at the airport or in the car, right Daddy?\" Sphinx snorted as they heard her father squawk . . . and she knew that his ears were turning red because he'd been caught. As usual. Augustus watched Chaosia and Ignatius leave the room before he sagged into the bed. Only to look back at it with a raised brow before shifting on the bed. It was actually comfortable . . . very comfortable. And the sheets looked divine . . . But with Chaosia what else would he expect? He sighed, laying his head in his hands before closing his eyes. His brother was nothing like he'd expected . . . and looked so much like their father-save with darker hair and a different eye color- that he'd been forced to shake himself back to rights. He'd expected Ignatius to be bitter or down right hateful . . . but he seemed to be genuinely neutral to his presence . . . or he had been before Guadimus had announced the change in lodgings. He had never intended to have to stay here . . . Not with everything he'd found out. And he had gone and opened his bloody mouth before he'd thought; almost single handedly destroying his only chance to get to know his only living family. And he knew that the driving stunt had been Ignatius's way of getting even . . . well, that and entertaining Prometheus. He stood, going to his bags and pulling them open, trying to find something to wear out. From the way they acted, nothing he'd brought would be appropriate but he could at least try. He didn't need to do anything else to ostracize himself now that he was here. Or to make this any harder on his brother . . . He started going through things, trying to find something that would work when a knock on the door brought his eyes up . . . to lock with Chaosia's as she stepped into the room. With a pair of denim pants and what looked like a shirt folded in her hands. And a thick brown belt. She smiled, crossing to him and extending the clothes like it was a laurel branch. \"I figured you were prepared for a typical British Elite function . . . so consider this a crash course in your American corruption. The jeans and shirt should fit . . . Paul and I picked them up earlier.\" She turned, going to leave before she stopped and looked back at him; her bottom lip between her teeth as she looked him over. Finally she sighed, closing the door as she leaned against it. She looked to the floor before looking back up to him . . . and he could tell that whatever she was about to say wasn't going to be candid or off the cuff of her shirt. Meaning she'd thought about it. Christ he was in trouble . . . \"I know that there are some . . . things between you and Sphinx that . . . that are difficult. And they aren't going to go away or resolve over night. But I want you to know that-despite whatever happens- we are happy that you decided to come. And we want you to be here. With us . . . But on that note, Augustus I have to tell you this. Your brother isn't like anyone else I've ever known. He's severe and quiet and hardheaded . . . but he is a good, decent man. One that I love more than anything else in this world . . . . So I'm asking you if you don't want to be part of this-or you're just trying to sate some kind of curiosity or whatever- then please just tell us. Because he's worked hard to build himself a life here . . . . it may not be what anyone ever dreamed for him but its his. And I would hate to think that you would hurt him . . .\" Augustus looked down at the clothes in his hands before he nodded once. He didn't know what else to do . . . \"I don't plan on it . . .\" She smiled at him, nodding before turning to leave again. But as he went to unfasten his tie he stopped. Because her parting words left him feeling cold. Christ she really was her father's daughter . . . \"Good. Because if you do, they won't find the shallow grave I leave what's left of you in . . . We'll leave whenever you're ready.\" He turned, watching her slip back through the door as quietly as she'd come . . . and he had to wonder what in the hell he'd gotten himself into. Sphinx walked into his bedroom, shedding the bloody coat before he stopped to look at Paul. Who just looked up from the magazine he was reading before rolling his eyes and going right back to it. \"Don't mind me. I'm letting Calamity get the hostess mode out of her system before I go aggravate the old man.\" Sphinx rolled his own eyes before crossing to the closet and putting the jacket back on the hanger. He could live with the damned shirt and the rest of it but he wasn't dealing with the damned cumbersome jacket any longer than he had to. Despite how good Chaosia claimed he looked in it. He snorted to himself. More like how much fun she had watching him suffer . . . . he knew she'd gotten him the damned blazer as part of his Christmas but he hated it. And only wore it when he absolutely had to. He moved further into the walk-in, trying to find a pair of his suspenders. Because the damned shirt was getting tucked in and the belt was going away . . . but why couldn't he find any of them? He moved back out, going over to the dresser to see if she'd put them there when Paul's voice stopped him. \"If you're looking for your suspenders she hid them. She said you could get them back after today but you were going to wear the belt she bought you. Whether you liked it or not . . .\" Sphinx let out a long suffering sigh before turning to look at the man as he slid to his feet and stretched. Paul was dressed like he normally did . . . fitted black and white striped polo shirt and nicer jeans. With shoes very similar to the ones on his feet . . . save his were white leather instead of black; just like his belt and the leather bracelet he always wore. He sighed, shaking his head before going to move into the bathroom. Only to stop again as the other man spoke. He turned, not sure how to answer before he finally just decided to be honest. He knew that there were times that Paul was a better brother to his wife than her own were-though in Mikhail's case it was honestly just absent mindedness that caused it, unlike Bastian's dickish tendencies- and that he had proven himself trustworthy enough for whatever eh said to stay between them. \"How are you holding up? I know all of this is awkward and weird . . .\" He sighed, running a hand over his hair before shrugging. \"Honestly I have no bloody idea. He's been in the country less than an hour and I want to skin him alive . . .\" Paul nodded sagely before sighing and going towards the door. \"I hear that's normal with younger siblings . . . but I honestly couldn't tell you either way. Mine refuse to speak to me.\" He turned, brow raised. He had no idea that the man had any other family. Honestly, he'd thought that Chaosia was all he had . . . which is part of the reason he was so tolerant of their carrying on. Because he knew how that felt . . . even if he was never going to admit it. Christ he could hear Jackson if he did . . . \"How many do you have?\" He shrugged, shoving his hands in his pockets before looking back up. \"A younger brother and sister. Twins, actually. They're about nineteen now . . . But they don't have anything to do with me . . . Afraid the gay is contagious the way our fucking bigot of a father says it is, you know? Hell I haven't seen them since I was eighteen . . . which was almost eleven years ago . . . I probably wouldn't even know them if I saw them.\" He stilled, letting the information sink in before he asked, \"Would you even want to? Knowing how they feel?\" Paul nodded, turning back towards the doors before looking back to him with a grin. \"some days . . . I mean it would be nice to get to know them. And I know that a lot of the shit I would put up with would be the sins of my Father, you know? But I wouldn't try to hold that against them . . . at first anyway. I'd try to let them make up their own minds . . . until they got on my nerves and I let Chaosia help me scalp the, for being brats, of course.\" Sphinx chuckled, shaking his head as the other man left. And a loud shout filled the house as Guadimus groaned. \"Daddy Warbucks! You are in so much trouble! You were here two whole weeks and never bothered to come and see me? Me ? The person who is tasked with keeping your daughter out of jail!\" Only Paul . . . Chaosia watched Augustus sit in the corner of the large booth at the Penguin and she suddenly wondered if this had been a good idea. The man was like a fish out of water . . . and looked like he was about to stroke when their tattooed and pierced waiter popped by the table; winking at him and Paul before going off to put in their order. She turned, watching Sphinx lean back and just enjoy the relative chaos of the bar while her father smoked away happily. And chattered with Paul-over Augustus who was squeezed between them- who had finally forgiven him for not visiting the last time they were in. She smiled, leaning into her fiancé as he dipped to speak to her. \"Are they always like this?\" She nodded, giggling as Paul reached over and flicked her father's graying temples before shaking his head. Because her Dad looked about ready to skin him until he spoke. And then he was rolling in the damned floor. \"I can't believe what you Brits call hair care. Seriously when was the last time it was cut? Selene and Jacqueline are far too fabulous to let you run around going gray . . . Old Man. Hell I bet this drives your wife up the wall.\" \"Oh you have no idea. She keeps trying to get me to cover it. But I'm proud to have lived to this age . . . and these\" he tapped the small patch of silver \"Are courtesy of my wife and loving children. Right Calamity?\" She rolled her eyes, looking away from him as Paul laughed. The blonde turned to Augustus and started talking, filling him in on their big joke . . . and she watched the man's mouth tilt into a smile and he chuckled before he could stop himself. Something that made Sphinx stiffen beside her before she rubbed his thigh beneath the table. He relaxed, looping his arm over her shoulders and dropped a kiss to her curls. God he was going to go crazy . . . Apparently, Augustus didn't favor their father as heavily as he did physically but he sounded enough like the man when he spoke that she could see her husband's shoulders tense with every word that passed through his lips. And the other man's sarcasm wasn't helping anything . . . at all. She leaned up, running her nose along his jaw before pressing a little kiss against it. And smiled when she felt him start to unclench it. \"I love you . . .\" He sighed, dropping his face to press his forehead against hers before nodding. And she knew he wasn't going to speak until he could relax some more. \"Awwww! Aren't they just damned sickening? I mean the two of them are far too crazy and mean to look so damned sweet together . . . Am I right, Guadimus or am I right?\" Her father chuckled, pulling another cigarette from his coat before nodding as he lit it. And looked them over before turning to look at Augustus. Who was looking at them like he was in shock. She felt her own temper flare before she tired to push it down. She knew that Sphinx didn't look the type to be gentle or sweet. Hell most of the time he was just as severe and wicked as his crew thought he was. But he was hers . . . . and the side of him that they were seeing right now was exclusive to the two of them. And, as she felt him go to pull away to settle back she found herself pissed. She moved her foot under the table, solidly connecting with a knee. Only to pale as Augustus yelped and jumped in his seat, looking across to her like she was insane. \"What in the bloody hell did I do? I didn't say a damned thing for once! And I still get sodding kicked? Honestly?\" She opened her mouth to speak, trying to apologize before she turned to gape at Sphinx. Who's shoulders were shaking with the force of his laughter as he laid his head on the table . . . while she and Augustus just shared a look. Finally she rolled her eyes and moved again, kicking more to the left and nodding when Paul yelped and fell almost flat into the booth, holding his shin as he moaned. \"Oh goddamn it Chaosia! You kick like a bloody man! I'm telling Jacqueline!\" She huffed, rolling her eyes before she reached over and smacked Sphinx-who was still laughing as he sat back up and shook his head at her. He chuckled, pulling her against him again before looking to Augustus with a decidedly evil grin as the waiter reappeared laden down with enough food to feed an army. \"I would advise against being as far from him as possible . . . They tend to get violent.\" Augustus shook his head before looking to his plate as it was set in front of him. And Chaosia knew that it wasn't his it was hers. But watching him eye the side dish was too funny. \"I'll remember that . . . though it would've been nice to know before hand . . . What in the bloody hell is this?\" Her father looked over, grimacing as Paul reached out and snagged one of the fried pickles before dipping it in the ranch in the center of the table. And popping it right into his mouth like it wasn't anything. The same way she intended to . . . \"Fried pickles. Here, try one!\" Augustus went to say no only to have a chunk shoved into his mouth . . . and they watched him grimace before chewing the gooey mess. Only to glance back down at the plate skeptically. \"They're actually not that bad . . . once you get past the texture . . .\" Chaosia grinned, looking up to Sphinx as he scrunched his nose at the dish. He'd refused to even try them . . . maybe she just needed to force feed him. You know, when she wanted to loose a limb. She shook her head, passing the man his plate and liberating her own before he and Paul could scavenge anymore. They had their own food damn it! And that's probably going to be the nicest interaction between the two brothers . . . because they're both damned stubborn.[Chapter 47] WHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm alive! And now that Summer is done-and the sequel has more than a few chapters that are in revision- I can finally start focusing on this again! And there's even another treat in store my pretties . . . Inferno and Midnight please do not kill me. On with the show. Convincing Atley Augustus sank into the bed he'd taken over while he was stateside, sighing deeply as he closed his eyes. Christ if he'd ever thought that actually meeting Ignatius again would be like this he'd been dreaming. His brother was honestly the oddest person he'd ever met before in his life . . . with the exception of the woman he was marrying of course. And now he was going to be here for another fourteen days. With them. Almost completely and totally alone. Paul-Chaosia's rather eccentric and very outspoken friend- had told him that both his brother and future sister-in-law had taken the month off of work trying to get ready for the upcoming wedding. And before he'd been by the Guadimus American estate he'd thought it was an insane thing for either of them to do-especially considering he knew that the pittance of an offering his own mother had tossed at his brother before he'd left was long gone. But after seeing all of the plans that Selene was pouring over and how absolutely manic she looked trying to get all of the small details she'd been given responsibility for in check, he could see the necessity in the sabbatical. Because that woman alone could destroy everything that Chaosia had worked so hard to try and make . . . But it thrilled him to no end to see that Ignatius-no Sphinx . He had to get used to calling him Sphinx now- tolerated the woman about as well as he usually did. He sighed, pushing out of the plush covers and toppers to go and get undressed to shower. He'd visited with Bastian for a good three hours, letting them hash through his aggravation with the eldest Guadimus sibling before they'd tried to rejoin the others in the main sitting room. Where he'd watched Sphinx keep a careful eye on his future bride, glaring at Selene every time she went to say or do something even slightly out of line. And if it hadn't been terrifying to see how damned sinister his brother could look when he wanted to he would've laughed right along with Bastian. Who had decided that the man marrying his sister was worthy of respect after he'd explained their familial relation. Actually, Bastian had perked hearing the man was nobility-and insisted in some round about way they would be family- before offering to try and help as much as he could with all of the tension between them. An astoundingly sweet gesture from the normally egocentric and borderline assholish man. Augustus smirked, shaking his head as he shed the dark long sleeved tee shirt that Chaosia had given him before; setting it onto the dresser carefully before stepping out of his newly acquired jeans. He'd never thought he would like the denim pants-he actually liked wearing the suits and slacks he generally wore despite what people thought- but he was pleasantly surprised. Ignat- Sphinx seemed to live in them. And Chaosia had always worn them whenever he saw her. He shook his head, moving into the bathroom before looking everything over in near shock. Chaosia and Sphinx had stocked the thing to the brim; towels, soaps and shampoos, even cologne and shaving supplies were laid out and waiting to be used. He stepped closer, seeing that both of the bottles of cologne were actually what he generally wore . . . and that the toiletries were the exact brand he had in his own home. The level of thought and effort to make him feel welcomed astounded him. And he'd almost refused to come and stay with them. He shook his head, reaching out and starting the shower before he turned to grab one of the soft fluffy towels. At least Sphinx had seemed to mellow after Chaosia had kicked him at lunch . . . and his brother had seemed to slowly start to open up more and more the longer he was around his future in-laws. He'd watched the man ease into small conversations with Prometheus before Mikhail-who was nowhere near as bad as Bastian had claimed- had come in and started to force him to talk even more. He had to admit that it was odd to see the lot of them interact, Chaosia laughing and trying to keep peace as Sphinx drank beside her father; chuckling darkly as her brother worked with Paul to hassle Selene while Bastian goaded Mikhail every chance he got. It was like-despite their differences and even their dislike for one another at times- they were a family. A dysfunctional one but a family none the less. He sighed, stepping under the spray of the water and letting the heat soak into his weary flesh. But no matter what he did he couldn't make it warm him to the bone. Because despite the almost easy way the rest of his first day in the States had gone he couldn't bring himself to believe that Ignatius was actually okay with him being here. Even after seeing all of the thought they'd put into this. They had so much to talk about . . . and he had so much to atone for . . . He'd brought the letters he'd found in his mother's things, though he'd only been able to stomach opening and reading a few of the earlier ones. And even though he could practically taste how much his brother had loathed writing the damned things he had. For no other reason than to ask about him. His brother hadn't wanted to leave-if everything he'd learned was correct-and had wanted to try and at least stay in contact with him. Even after he'd moved to the states. But with every letter remaining unanswered they started to decay. Each new letter got shorter and shorter while more time seemed to be between their arrival. He sighed, shaking his head. He would put money on the last few he'd yet to open being barely anything but a few words at all . . . He closed his eyes, lifting his head to let the water run down over face. His mother had all but destroyed any chance of a semi-friendly relationship between them. And he wasn't so stupid as to think that he didn't hold blame here himself. He'd wondered where his brother was for years before he'd become bitter and then numb. And he'd never tried to find him. Had never sought him out . . . while his own flesh and blood had tried time and again to just keep some connection with him. He ran a hand through his sopping hair. This was a mess and a half. And he had absolutely no idea how to fix any of it. Or, more to the point if Sphinx would even be willing to try. He'd made a new life for himself here that seemed to fit him. And Chaosia had warned him about what would happen if he hurt her future husband. But still, he had to at least try . . . What the hell did he do now? Sphinx watched Atley grumble as they worked on the 2011 Camaro, getting the pristine black car to crank as quickly as they could. He hadn't really wanted to grab the damn thing up but Jackson seemed to need the joyride as much as he did when he'd called. So he'd agreed. The engine turned, breaking the stillness of the night air as the deep rumble called to them. He smirked, going to slide into the passenger seat when Atley shook his head; moving to go and plop into the plush leather before he could. But something about the tone in the other boost's voice made his hackles rise before he calmed himself. \"You're the one about to go crazy. Drive her into the ground before we go and collect for her.\" Sphinx snorted, rolling his eyes before he dipped his chin once. He settled into the seat, revving the engine after he pulled the door closed. And even though he'd had his doubts about the car before he had to admit that it did sound fierce. No where near as fierce as his own Malibu or even Eleanor. But it wasn't as whimpy as some of the newer sports and muscle cars they'd tossed at the masses recently. He pulled off, navigating to hit the coastal highway before he glanced back to Atley. Something was off with his friend. And even with all of the shit swirling in his own head about the wedding and his pop-up-half-brother he couldn't help but notice it. Which meant that it was pretty bad. Jackson hardly ever let on that anything was bothering him . . . not even to him . So for him to be able to pick up on it-even with his own head a mess-then it was severe. He sighed, switching lanes before he shook his head. God he didn't want to do this but he knew he had to. Atley wouldn't talk to anyone else, he was too hard headed. And Chaosia would skin both of them alive if he let this fester to a point that it disrupted their wedding. \"Bloody hell, Jackson. What's got you in such a state?\" Atley looked at him like he was crazy before rolling his eyes, turning to look back out the window as he settled deeper into the seat. Which just made Sphinx want to grind his damn teeth regardless of how much faster it would make him return to the damn torturer that Chaosia called a dentist. Oh that settled it. They weren't going back until this was cleared. Because he'd be damned if now that his world was starting to settle that Jackson was going to try and go off the deep end. He wouldn't bloody tolerate it. \"Well? Out with it.\" Atley turned, glaring at him before sat up straighter. Which gave Sphinx the opportunity to see the changes in his friend over the past weeks. He had shaved his normal stubble down to the barest hint of a five o'clock shadow. And his clothes were cleaner than usual . . . with nowhere near as many wrinkles or spots. Not to say that Atley was unkempt-far from it actually-but occasionally the man would let something slide. The same way Donnie or the rest of the lads-save Memphis and Otto- would. Because he didn't have someone in his life to constantly . . . Sphinx shook his head, trying not to chuckle as he turned back to the road as things started to click. Oh this was too bloody rich! Jackson had started to dress like this after Jacqueline had noticed him. And he'd been getting surlier and surlier every time Tumbler spoke since the tux fitting. He bit back another laugh. Chaosia was going to have a field day with this . . . but not before he did. Atley's voice however stopped him dead in his train of thought. \"I'm going fucking insane. That's what has me in 'such a state'. And no matter what I do I can't seem to make my fucking brain understand that I am not going to be put in this kind of situation. I mean what does a girl like that want with some old crip like me, huh? Especially with fucking Tumbler baying at the moon about her every chance he fucking gets. I need to get fucking laid . . . because honestly. One small smile and a few little blushes has me tied up in knots! I've got to be cracking up!\" Oh fuck. This wasn't what he'd been expecting. He'd thought that Jackson had noticed the girl-or, more to the point her being sweet on him - and had decided to try and ease into something. The way he'd advised him to with Chaosia what seemed like an eternity ago. But he was obviously still in the dark. Christ where were Chaosia and Paul when he needed them? Because he really didn't want to be the one to have to have this conversation. Not even with Atley . He sighed, spotting a turn off for one of the many beach accesses and slowed to take it. He hated to do this but it had to be done. And if Atley breathed a word to anyone he would gut him. He shook his head. This would be another time in six months that he'd had to talk with one of the bloody crew to set them to rights. When in the hell did he become the shrink for the Long Beach boosts? Atley watched Sphinx park before shaking his head. He'd known he shouldn't have said anything . . . and now the guy was going to freak out on him. Not that he blamed him. Chaosia had called and dropped him the hint that Sphinx was going to pick up his brother. And that the ungrateful little shit stain would be staying with them until they lit out for their honeymoon. Which is what prompted him to be ready for the call when Sphinx had finally gotten away from the others. He looked out over the water. His friend had enough going on right now . . . and even though he was more than a little upset with him for not even mentioning he had any family left he still wasn't going to land all of this at his feet. He could handle his own stupid drama and hang ups. Even if they didn't make any damned sense to him. He sighed, turning to tell Sphinx to just go on to drop the car when the man's voice filled the quiet of the car. And Atley had to marvel as a realization hit him. He and Sphinx had carried on more than their share of conversations about a plethora of different things. But neither really talked about what was going on with them emotionally. Him because he'd learned long ago that to let people that close was to open up a weakness they could-and more often than not would- exploit the second they got the chance. And Sphinx . . . . well getting ten words out of him before Chaosia had popped up was a damn trial in itself. He wasn't going to push or pester the guy into opening up if he didn't want to. Even when he'd been able to tell that the weight of everything around him was about to break him. Mainly because he hadn't wanted to clean up the bodies from the killing spree that was sure to follow . . . \"She's barely paid that boy any attention at all from what Chaosia claims. Actually she tries to hide from him. Thinks he's too . . . odd.\" Atley raised a brow before shaking himself, squashing the hope trying to blossom. He was fine alone. Hell he'd been alone so long he didn't really know any other way to be. And while he knew if Sphinx could make the changes necessary to welcome another person into his life permanently-God that was still a mind fuck to try and think about- he wasn't too keen on the circumstances. One the girl was half his age-actually less than half if he wanted to be technically correct- and she was just out of an obviously horrid and abusive relationship. And that was before he even went on to think about the fact that she was only in Long Beach until she felt it was safe to return to London . . . with the child she was carrying. He shook his head. God why in the hell had he gotten himself into this mess? \"Yeah well that's great and all but I have to be realistic about all of this shit, Sphinx. She's not your average girl. She's freaking nobility in England. Just like her kid will be . . . and as soon as she feels like its okay for her to move back she's going to. And that would always be at the forefront of everything. Well, after the kid. I mean . . . a kid! How in the hell am I even contemplating any of this?\" Sphinx just looked at him before rolling his eyes, settling back into the plush leather seats as he shook his head and chuckled. And Atley knew that the man was exacting his revenge for all of the quiet chuckles and good natured hassling he'd done when he and Chaosia had just been starting out. He glared at the man as he spoke, crossing his arms in a huff as he turned to look out the windows. The water was dark and slowly churning, the tide creeping in higher and higher every time the waves would crash against the gray shore beyond the dunes. The clouds in the horizon told him it would probably rain sometime over night . . . well that and the pain in his leg. The damn thing did always hurt more when the weather was about to turn. \"No clue . . . but a kid isn't that bloody bad, Jackson. And the girl's here permanently. Chaosia is going to help her look at lofts and flats tomorrow.\" Atley turned, raising a brow. What in the hell was he talking about now? Sphinx however just nodded once, glancing out at the water before shaking his head. And Atley had to wonder how much of his newly acquired mellowness had come from his future wife . . . and how much had always been there beneath everything he'd carried for years. Something they were going to sit down and talk about before all of this was said and done. But first he was going to explain what he'd just said. \"Uh what the fuck are you going on about now? I know that we call you Sphinx and all but don't talk in fucking riddles. Christ I think I liked it better when you didn't speak period. Now I get this yoda shit.\" Sphinx glowered at him before rolling his eyes, shaking his head again as he looked at him like he was stupid. Something the man had never done before. Christ if this how he made the kids feel when he looked at them like that then why did they still act so damned foolish? \"She's staying in the States, Jackson. Guadimus is setting her up so her kid won't have to deal with the shite across the pond. Ambrose signed over his rights . . . and while that means that the child is recognized as a member of his family it also makes it a bastard. The kid's never gonna be able to claim what is it's unless his grandparents strip their son of his title. And even though they want to know the child I doubt they're going to go to that extreme. Any contact they have is going to be pretty limited. Part of the reason that Selene and Guadimus have already asked me and Chaosia to help the girl settle. I thought you knew all of this.\" Atley shook his head, chewing over what he'd just learned. Well that dealt with about three of his issues where the girl was concerned. The baby daddy was out of the picture for good, she wasn't going to just pick up and leave one day and she seemed content to give up most of the frilly ways she'd lived in to make sure her child would be safe. A definite plus . . . He glanced over at Sphinx, biting the proverbial bullet as he let loose a long suffering sigh. \"Well then what do you suggest I do about this? I mean, she's your future sister-in-law . . .\" Sphinx shrugged, reaching over to crank the car again. And Atley was about to throttle him. Had he seriously made him dredge all of this up just to do it? He knew he'd meddled and messed with the man's relationship-only out of the limited goodness in his heart damn it- but this was just too damn cruel! He opened his mouth to landblast the stoic runner when he spoke, making him stop completely. Christ he was serious . . . and he was right. \"I would suggest doing whatever it takes to make it work if that's what you want. But first I would talk to Chaosia. She's known her longer . . . and she isn't going to lead you astray. Or tell you to buy engagement rings to start a huge war between the two of you.\" Atley glared at him before rolling his eyes, nodding as he settled into the seat as the larger boost pulled out of the spot. And even as Sphinx raced towards Manday's to drop the pristine car he felt himself start to lighten. He'd found himself wondering- ever so often- if Sphinx really just tolerated the lot of them so he would have a crew when he needed one. But this had helped put that fear to rest. The man was genuinely his friend . . . he cared about what happened with his life and in the lives of the others around him. He was just too ass-backwards and introverted to do much about it. He sighed, glancing back out the window as Long Beach passed them by. Knowing that at least made him feel a little bit better about some of the things in his life at the moment. Even if the largest one wasn't going to work out the way he wanted it too . . . What in the hell would a girl like that want with him anyway? Chaosia sighed as she felt the bed dip behind her, rolling into her fiancé as his arm reached out and tugged her closer. She turned to face him, snuggling into his chest as his fingers wound themselves in her curls while he pressed his lips to the crown of her head. It was the small moments like this that she wanted to live in forever . . . but she knew that as soon as they said 'I Do' that the majority of their stress would fall away. And things would level out to a point that they could manage. And if he needed to boost a million cars until then she would let him. She was serious . . . he was a grown ass man who had a life long before she was ever in it. And if this was how he kept from strangling the people around them then so be it. She was going to lock herself away in the office after she went house shopping with Jacqueline and Paul tomorrow anyway . . . and whatever piece of art she made would be a good house warming gift for the girl. She looked up at him, watching him sigh as he dipped to run his nose along hers. She grinned sleepily, pressing her lips to the corner of his as she cuddled closer to him. It was nights like tonight that she was happy he liked to cuddle up with her . . . and that she didn't have to threaten anything in his manly macho world to get him to lay with her. He raised a brow, kissing the tip of her nose as she giggled. \"And what pray tell is so funny, wife?\" She grinned, shrugging as she rested her ear and cheek over the left side of his chest; listening to his steady heartbeat as they laid together. The night was peaceful despite being cooler . . . and even though she knew he wasn't happy about it the breeze pouring in their open bedroom windows and veranda doors had made the room comfortable. Especially when the rain started later. She shifted, answering him as his left hand caught hers; playing with her rings idly as they lounged. \"Just thinking about your secret love of cuddling is all . . . I would've never thought when I met you that you would like to do this. Hell, I kind of thought I was going to go home minus a head for even touching you.\" He chuckled darkly before stilling beneath her, his chest bunching enough to let her know he was starting to brood over something. She swatted him before smoothing her hand over his bare chest, tracing one of the many scars there as she chided him. \"Don't start that . . . we both need to sleep. I have to go with Jacqueline and Paul and you're eating lunch with Daddy and Khail. I think Memphis is tagging along too . . .\" He snorted and she didn't need to look up to know he was rolling his eyes. She bit her bottom lip, her hand stilling before she gathered enough courage to actually suggest the thought that had shot through her mind earlier in the day. If he said no then she would leave it alone . . . but she could at least ask. \"You could always take Augustus . . . I mean, you know Bastian is going to whine until he can go. And if Augustus is there then maybe they'll keep each other entertained. They did okay together at the house earlier.\" He shifted, sitting up enough that he could look down at her with a raised brow before he rolled his eyes and flopped back into the mountain of pillows. And even with as serious as the motion was supposed to be she couldn't fight the giggles that escaped her. It was too damned funny to watch her towering future husband collapse into the mound of down and silk with the exasperated sigh. Just like a damn kid . . . He rolled his eyes, flicking her shoulder before he tugged her to splay across his chest; practically forcing her to settle in his lap as he shifted and got comfortable against the pillows and the headboard. He moved, running his lips over her collarbone and up her neck; leaving tiny kisses in his wake as he pulled her closer to him. She laughed quietly, smacking his chest as she tried to get loose. She knew that she'd promised him a grand evening but that was before they'd stayed with her family for almost six hours and he'd run off with Atley for another three. \"Sphinx! Stop it! We need to sleep . . . or we're both going to be zombies tomorrow.\" He shrugged his brows to her, kissing up to chin before nipping at her jaw lightly. She whined, titling her head for him. He wasn't playing fair! He seemed to pick up on her train of thought and chuckled, kissing the spot he'd nipped before whispering to her. \"We'll sleep in . . . but I seem to remember a promise of a long hot bath. Among other things . . .\" She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth again, looking him over skeptically before she nodded to him once. She knew they really did need to sleep but what the hell . . . they were practically married after all. And if it would help him unwind then she was definitely all for it. She was still having nightmares of him just tearing through the wedding guests before the ceremony when he finally snapped. She knew it was stupid but with him it was still a possibility. He hadn't mellowed out that damn much . . . \"If you promise to get up with me in the morning and go surf then I guess we can keep our plans.\" He groaned, before looking up at her beseechingly; making her have to fight back her laughter. He hated the beach almost as much as she loved it. A point of contention that had made trying to plan their honeymoon so damned bothersome. But she knew when he sagged against her, pressing his forehead to her collarbone as he nodded and grumbled that she'd won. She smiled, pressing her lips against his temple. She'd take him to breakfast since he was going to go and watch her surf. Because trying to get him to even attempt to stand on the board once had been a fight she was not ever going to repeat. So it had been the middle of January and the water was freezing. Big deal . . . at least there weren't that many sharks out when she'd tried to share her love of the water. Oh well, they still had football and cars . . . \"Bloody fine. Drag me to the damn sand trap at the ass crack of dawn on no sleep. See if I care.\" She laughed, cupping his face and bringing his eyes up to hers as she rubbed her nose against his. And when he smirked at her she knew most of his grumbling was good natured. He just didn't know that she would get him into the damn ocean one day if it was the last thing she did. \"Awww . . . my poor baby. I promise it'll be okay. I'll take you to breakfast. We can catch brunch at the Skyroom if you want to. Just spend some time together before we have to deal with the rest of these crazies.\" His face softened as he nodded, his lips ghosting over hers as he craned his neck to get better access. She smiled to him, wrapping her arms around his neck as she moved so he could reach her. \"I'd like that . . . your family and my bloody brother are going to be the death o' me yet.\" She kissed him sweetly, pulling away to nip the tip of his nose before she shot out of his lap and off the bed, taunting him as she ran into the bathroom laughing. \"Yeah well I offered to elope. You wanted the big fancy wedding . . .\" He growled, moving to follow her as she laughed. But she knew from the tilt of his lips that he was okay for now. A lot of the tension from before had ebbed away with his excursion . . . and the rest was fading slowly. She'd have to remember to thank Atley tomorrow when she saw him. Because few people could handle her beau in bad mood the way his best friend could. She reached out, turning on the water when his words stopped her. \"Atley's going with you tomorrow. I think he wants to talk with you about Jacqueline . . . and to test the waters for himself.\" She glanced back at him like he was crazy . . . surely he was out of his mind . . . Atley was going with them? Her and Paul? She shook herself before raising a brow at him, suddenly skeptical. What was he up to? \"Okay . . . but why tomorrow? I mean, why the rush? What did you do?\" He shrugged, crossing to her before he tugged her sleep shirt-one of his black tee shirts she'd stolen when they were still living in separate apartments- over her head. He tossed it aside, running his hands down her sides to rest on her hips; tugging her into him. She glanced up at him, shivering as he spoke to her. \"Just mentioned what was mentioned to me . . . He was all in knots, girlie. I had to do something or he was gonna do something stupid.\" She nodded, rolling her eyes as he dipped to kiss her. She knew no one would ever believe it but her husband was a big ol' softie when it came to his friends . . . well, at least when he could stand them anyway. She sighed, letting the rest of the day fall away as she leaned into him. They would deal with the rest tomorrow but for now she just wanted to enjoy this. Because she doubted they would get many more opportunities. Ahhh. Finally. This chapter never wanted to cooperate for some reason. But now everything is finally starting to drift back onto the track I need it to go . . . and hopefully we might get to see this damn wedding that's driving me insane before the fourth of july! Okay now nobody hold me to that . . . Later. And thanks for all of the reviews and support.[Chapter 48] See? I'm not dead! But I have to warn everyone the wedding is still a few chapters off. God even planning a fictional one is a pain in the ass! Alrightie then . . . here we go. Oh and please excuse any misspellings. I tried to catch them all but I still think a few slipped past me. The horrors of proof reading in a hospital room. Playing Normal Chaosia glared at Atley as he fidgeted in the front seat of the Aston, shifting ever-so-often in his seat as they waited for the last light before they reached her father's home. She took a steadying breath, trying not to snap at him for being so ancy. She knew he was just nervous-okay he was a solid bundle of frayed and over stimulated nerves at this point but she wasn't petty enough to point that out- but he seriously needed to stop before the last little bit of her patience waned more than it already had. She turned her eyes back to the road, counting to a hundred in French in her head as she tried to gather her own reserve. She was going to murder her soon-to-be- husband when she got home . . . because there was no way he didn't know that this was going to be a trial and a half when he'd suggested it. The light turned green, causing her to sigh in relief as she pulled away from the line a little faster than she should have. Oh well. The faster she got there then the faster she could be done with all of this. She still had to go and check on the damn venue after all of this. She took the next turn into the private community, grinning darkly to herself as she slung Atley in the floorboards with a shocked squawk. Well, she'd told his ass to put on his seat belt but oh no. He had to be the big bad boost and prove he could handle anything she did . . . She'd only had to sling Sphinx around twice to get him to relent to her seatbelt rule. He shifted, resettling in his seat as he glared at her; running a hand over his now groomed hair to try and smooth it back in place. She giggled, shaking her head as she shrugged innocently. She'd gotten him to let Paul cut and style his hair when he'd showed up at her house at the ass crack of dawn . . . for them to end up having to do what he normally did anyway. Apparently Atley Jackson was the proud owner of auburn blondish brown Einstein hair. And the only way it would style-other than sticking up in a frizzy mess at all angles- was slicked straight back. Well at least all of his ends were even now and the back was the right length. Atley turned, glaring at her as her thoughts tried to return to her wedding catastrophe. Well at least having him around wouldn't let her harp on the fact that her venue wasn't ready yet. With only thirteen damn days to go . . . \"Was that really necessary? Between Sphinx's damn riddles and your driving the two of you are going to kill me before I get shot down.\" She rolled her eyes, pulling into the driveway of her father's home before maneuvering over to the side so Paul could park beside them. She grinned, watching her friend wave frantically back to her as he killed his own car. Which just made Atley groan and drop his head to the dashboard with a pretty loud thud. She reached out, patting his shoulder with a chuckle. She knew this was her husband's way of helping Atley . . . and getting even with him for going ahead and planning a Bachelor's party without any consideration for what he would or wouldn't enjoy. Chaosia sighed, unbuckling her belt and opening the door; basking in the early morning Californian sun for a few moments before waving at Paul again. She knew her hubby wasn't as averse to all of the guy stuff as the others thought-because she'd yet to meet a man that wasn't all for drinking, goofing off and scantily clad women dancing around-but she thought it was sweet he'd at least put up the fight to begin with. And so long as he only looked at the scantily clad women dancing around then they really wouldn't have a problem . . . and Atley could keep his head. She patted the top of the car, trying not to laugh as Atley slowly piled out and looked to the front doors like they were the gates of Hell. God where was her evil lover when she needed him? He honestly couldn't be having anymore fun showing Augustus around the shop than she was watching his best friend squirm. She sobered, rolling her eyes skyward and sending up a silent prayer. Hopefully the lot of them would at least make it to lunch before some fight broke out or someone lost an arm . . . But knowing Augustus and Bastian that was an awfully big thing to ask for. Especially with how her oldest brother seemed to have taken to Sphinx. She shook her head, going around the car and catching one of Atley's arms. Letting Paul get a good grip on the other before they started dragging him up the walkway. God why were men so damned hardheaded? And how in the hell was he able to make himself practically dead weight and fight them at the same time? Augustus watched the man he'd been introduced to-one Randal 'Memphis' Raines- tinker with the gleaming chrome and gray engine of the sleek gunmetal gray car. He'd never been partial to American automobiles but he had to admit to himself that this car-named Eleanor for whatever reason- was absolutely gorgeous. And apparently took a good deal of work to keep in working order. But the smiling mechanic didn't seem to mind. Actually he seemed to love messing with the greasy dirty mess almost as much as Mikhail loved helping him. Augustus turned, eying the stepson of Guadimus as he handed Raines the tool he requested before wiping his own hands on a less than pristine red shop rag. He raised a brow as the rag seemed to deposit more dirt and grime than it removed but Mikhail didn't seem to mind. He watched the man reach over, taking a long drink of the bottled water he had handy before turning to answer the call of another worker. Which gave Augustus the time to actually inspect both men. Raines was tall, a few inches shy of himself with casually styled blondish brown hair and friendly blue eyes. But something about the way the man watched most things around him made him wary. Memphis Raines wasn't as relaxed as he acted . . . or at the very least as blissfully oblivious to the chaos he lived in. He was just used to it enough that he didn't fret over the normal abnormalities. He shook himself, looking to his brother's future brother-in-law. Mikhail was as tall as Raines if not a few centimeters taller with spiked black hair that seemed to defy gravity as he moved and interacted fluidly with the other people around them. His violet blue eyes seemed to constantly switch colors-the same as his sister's- while he watched or reacted to the things around him. But even as he'd watched him get aggravated with one of the other workers- a short brightly dressed man that would only answer to the moniker Mirror- he'd never gotten out of hand or violent. Meaning that a lot of Bastian's claims about the man were probably unfounded if not the direct result of his own mistreatment of the laid back mechanic. Mikhail turned back, raising a brow as he looked him over before shaking his head. Which brought Memphis's head up from the engine he'd been working over to look at him as well. Augustus shifted in his Italian leather loafers, suddenly feeling even more like the odd man out than he had before. He'd been told they were going to eat lunch after they checked on some small detail so he'd dressed appropriately. But now as he looked over the other two men in the their grease covered coveralls-and the jeans and tee shirts that were surely hidden beneath them- he felt more than slightly overdressed in his dark gray slacks and black dress shirt. Again. Maybe he needed to take Chaosia up on her offer and go shopping for some more relaxed clothing while he was Stateside . . . He looked back up as Mikhail's voice carried to him above the sounds of the garage. But his tone-while laced with disbelief and skepticism- was still cordially and friendly. Hell it was almost teasing. \"You can't seriously be comfortable like that right? I mean you and Sphinx are only half-brothers . . . but you have to have something in common.\" Memphis grinned, shaking his head as he went back to work. But Augustus was shocked to hear what he had to say, almost as much as Mikhail if his reaction was anything to judge by. He moved closer, trying to catch every word as the man spoke. He'd known his brother the longest of the three of them- at least as far as he was concerned-so it stood to reason that either he or Jackson would be the ones to defer to. But he was still having a hard time believing this . . . \"I don't know . . . . Remember when you made us meet Monique? We were both about to die in those damn suits but he was fine. Actually he looked just as at home in that freaking monkey suit as he does his jeans and tee shirts. And I know for fact that he's worn a tux at least once since he and your sister got together. Could be genetic to be okay in all of those . . . layers. You ever seen how fucking much he wears just to go to work?\" Mikhail nodded, grinning as he leaned against the car. And Augustus was aware that he was getting to see more of his brother's habits- of his personality- than he had before. Because he was getting to see him through the eyes of the people he was so loyal to. And that were loyal to him. \"Dude you should've seen Ripley trying to pack for them to go to London for Christmas. Or when she was trying to find him damn presents. I swear I think she pulled out a few handfuls of hair before she finally called Harrods and started ordering. And that's not even going into how hard it was to consolidate everything down and into the walk-in closets at their house.\" Memphis looked up as Augustus raised a brow of his own, shaking his head. He'd seen his brother's home and the massive walk-ins in the master suite. And though the things were packed to the bloody gills, he honesty thought most of it was Chaosia's. She was related to Selene and Jacqueline even if it was only by marriage. But from the way that Mikhail was going on the two might be evenly matched in the competition for closet space. He shook his head, speaking before he could really stop himself. \"How hard could it have been? I've yet to see him in anything but jeans and either tee shirts or bloody oxfords. How much could he possibly have to compete with Chaosia?\" Memphis looked at him like he was crazy while Mikhail just laughed, shaking his head. And Augustus was suddenly thankful that the man hadn't taken his tone any way other than how he'd meant it. Honest but bored curiosity. His next words made him start though. \"Uh try he has more suits and dress clothes than a department store. He kind of has to though. He's a freaking pathologist. He can't go to work in jeans and oxfords and tees. And how the hell can both of you sound bored when you finally manage to speak? I mean we're not going to have to drag conversation out you with a crow bar the way we do him right? Because I don't think we can handle two Sphinxes.\" Memphis nodded, laughing as he looked over; wiping his hands on a clean shop towel. \"Amen to that Khail. I'm still shocked he speaks to your sister most days. Let alone asked her to marry him . . . . God to have been a fly on the wall for that conversation. I kind of understand why he did it in London you know?\" Augustus raised a brow. That was the second time they'd alluded that his brother had gone back to England while he'd been with Chaosia. And apparently he'd asked her to marry him while they were across the pond . . . He sighed, shaking himself. Just another wasted opportunity to get to know him. Mikhail watched him closely, unzipping his coveralls to reveal a dark blue tee shirt and the tops of denim jeans. With a clunky brown leather belt with a huge glittering belt buckle. He raised a brow, cocking his head to the side. \"What in the bloody hell is own your belt?\" Mikhail looked down before Memphis raised his own brow. But a few seconds later both men were snickering as their shoulders shook. Finally Memphis was laughing as loud as he could, doubled over as he laid his head on his folded arms, while Mikhail collected himself enough to explain. But the explanation just left him even more baffled. He really needed a bloody translator for some of this shite. \"It's a belt buckle. You know, like one of the ones you change out? Ripley found me this one at some shop downtown forever ago and I decided to wear it today. Why? Not a Batman fan?\" Augustus looked up at him, shaking his head as he looked back to the stylized black car buckle. The thing was huge, taking up most of space between the first two belt loops and gleaming in the low light of the shop. But no matter how hard he wanted to look away he couldn't. Christ what was with these people and bloody cars? \"What in the world does a bat man have to do with that? And why do you insist on calling Chaosia Ripley? I've yet to hear another person do so.\" Mikhail just shrugged, grinning lopsidedly as Memphis wiped his now dirt smudged face as his chuckles subsided. \"Batman is the name of the movie that the car on the buckle is fashioned after. You know? The original Batman movie with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson?\" Augustus shook his head slowly, watching the other two share a look before they sighed. But Mikhail kept going, answering his other question. \"Well, it's a good movie. And Ripley got this for me because I liked it. I call her that because it's her name . . . and its what our mom used to call her. I know she acts all aggravated but whenever I go to call her Chaos she thinks I'm mad at her. Besides, even with all of the changes she's made and making she's still my little sister. I'm allowed to aggravate her a little. Actually it's kind of expected. I think she'd freak out if I didn't.\" Memphis laughed, nodding as he went to unzip his own coveralls; moving to step out of the dirt and oil stained dark gray suit as he spoke. But Augustus felt better when he saw the man's dark blue slacks and the gray tee shirt. Even though the pants were made out of some odd material they weren't the jeans Ignatius and Mikhail were wearing. Meaning that he wasn't too over dressed. Thank God . \"She probably would . . . I know Kip almost freaks whenever I call him Kipling instead of Kip. Though I've got to admit watching your sister call him Skipper before she left for London in February was amazing. I never thought to do that . . .\" Augustus watched them interact, listening to the way both men aggravated and antagonized their siblings. But even as he shook his head he had to wonder if Ignatius had stayed in London if they would be the same way. Would he resent the familiar treatment the way that Raines's brother seemed to or would he cherish it as normal the way he'd seen Chaosia. He shook his head, turning to watch his brother stride in slowly; shaking his head as he slipped his cell phone into his coat pocket. He raised a brow, taking in what his brother had on for the first time. He had to agree with the other two. His brother definitely lived in far too many layers. At least he only had on the shirt and slacks over his underclothes. But Ignatius was wearing a pair of darker jeans with a black tee shirt beneath a dark gray oxford shirt . . . and he knew that the sleeves were cuffed and rolled to his elbows beneath the black lightweight coat. Just like he knew the man was wearing suspenders instead of a belt. Sphinx turned to him before looking to the others, raising a brow as Memphis started chuckling again. And Augustus knew he was blushing as the man started to hassle them. God was he insane? Did he not know just how severe his brother's temperament was? Or had he honestly just been around him long enough that he didn't care? \"Dude I gotta say I don't see much resemblance other than you both being freaking huge . Hell Sphinx he wears belts for God's sakes. I figured any family you had would be all about the suspenders.\" Sphinx rolled his eyes, snorting as he shook his head. And Augustus watched a dark grin spread over his brother's face before he spoke. Obviously shocking both of the other men as he rose to the bait Raines had tossed out. How little did he speak to them to make the little quip so shocking? \"Just like Kip's love of all things Shelby right Raines?\" Memphis glared, crossing his arms as he snorted. And Mikhail chuckled, shaking his head as he patted the other man's shoulder. What in the hell were they going on about now? \"That was a low blow, man. Its not my fault he can't seem to embrace the beauty or Shelby Motors. Our old man probably rolled in his grave when Kip picked that damn Celica Supra over the AC Roadster. I mean seriously a Toyota? Over a Shelby AC Roadster . . . it just aint right.\" Sphinx chuckled darkly, shaking his head before turning to look at him with a raised brow. And he seemed to see he was in the dark because he took pity on him. Filling him in on the dilemma as the others just gaped. \"Raines brother has decided his favorite car is the late eighties model Supra. He chose to work on one over a rare Shelby AC Cobra roadster a few months back.\" Augustus looked between them, really not knowing much of what they were talking about but he knew an attempt to include him when he saw one. He swallowed the lump in his throat before glancing to Raines. And he sent out a silent prayer as he spoke that he wasn't about to embarrass himself or his family. Because he doubted he'd get a chance to fix it if he did. \"Well he's bloody crazy then. Who picks a Supra over that?\" Sphinx raised a brow before grinning, nodding slightly once when Memphis seemed to mellow. And even though he had no idea what he'd just agreed to it was nice to see he'd said the right thing. Now if he could just follow the rest of the conversation he might just survive until they left for lunch. Christ he'd be glad to see Bastian. At least then he would have someone to talk to that he didn't have to worry about saying the wrong damned thing . . . Part one of the update for today! Yay![Chapter 49] And part two! I know its been forever since we've seen two chapters at once . . . Falling Through Sphinx sighed as he watched Augustus and Bastian drain their drinks, Guadimus's eldest son practically slurping the dark beer down before he slammed his empty glass onto the table. He raised a brow before shaking his head, watching his brother reach over and smack Bastian in the back of the skull a little harder than necessary. It was easy to see who was the more responsible of the two . . . and Augustus seemed to open up and relax a bit more around the other two Brits. He grinned darkly to himself, trying not to chuckle as he watch Bastian pout while Mikhail just laughed and pointed; obviously enjoying the rude treatment his less-than-favorite step sibling was receiving. Bastian had yet to let any of them hear the end of how horrible it was that Augustus had 'fallen prey' to Mikhail's charms . . . and had called him out on being such an ass at least four times since they'd set down to eat. He turned, watching Raines grin as he shook his own head. And even though it was odd to sit here with both his friends and future in-laws it was . . . nice . Almost peaceful really. Something he'd never thought he would have in his lifetime . . . especially with Augustus here among them. He glanced back at his brother, watching him closely as he turned to talk with Mikhail and Guadimus. When he'd found out that Chaosia and Selene had sent the lad an invite to their wedding he'd been livid, beyond livid actually. But now that he was here-and he'd committed himself to taking much of the boy's sarcastic tone as just the way he spoke and was- he could see that it hadn't been that bad of an idea. He was just never going to admit to anyone. Especially not Chaosia. She'd torn herself up to a point over disappointing him that he'd honestly thought she was suicidal . . . with a pretty severe case of alcohol poisoning. And he knew with the way he'd stormed out and behaved that he hadn't helped any of their under laying issues. But he'd been so damned mad to hear that the boy had been informed of anything to do with him that he'd just snapped at the first person handy. Too many years of trying to contact him-to build some even limited form of relationship with him before he'd finally just stopped-had left him more than slightly bitter. Well, that coupled with the less than wonderful treatment he'd received from his father and Celeste even before the boy had been born. Especially with the way they'd both doted on him. Sphinx shook himself, bringing his attention back to the present as Bastian spoke. And he could see that even Guadimus and Mikhail were shocked he was actually talking to him. \"So . . . Chaosia says that you're a pathologist here in the States. How long have you done that then?\" Sphinx blinked, trying to tally up the years in his head before he glanced to Memphis and Mikhail skeptically. Mikhail wouldn't care one way or another but too much information would give Raines something to hassle him with. A trait the man shared with Atley when the mood struck him. Finally he sighed, looking back to one of his future brother-in-laws with a shrug of his brows. Oh what the hell, why not tell them? What could it possibly hurt now? \"Almost fifteen years now . . . I graduated and went straight into a position with the Los Angeles Coroner's Office. I moved into the Long Beach office full time about two years later.\" Bastian nodded, obviously interested but Sphinx watched the way Augustus was listening intently. He fought snorting. He might not be totally resentful of the kid being here but he wasn't all great with it either. And the lad had yet to ask him any of these questions himself . . . He turned back to Bastian as he spoke again, blatantly ignoring the looks of his stepbrother and father as he plowed ahead. \"Really? Wow . . . Did you finish all of your education here or did you do some in Britain?\" Sphinx raised a brow but shook himself, answering. Hell, if he was asking now then it was less questions to answer for the other family members later. Family members that would start arriving in less than four days. He fought a shudder, remembering that not only would Chaosia's slew of cousins and distant-but-close-knit relations be here but that her grandmother-the Matriarch of the Guadimus household herself- would be among them as soon as Monday. God now that wasn't something he was looking forward to at all . . . \"I finished up through my secondary across the pond, boy-o. But I enrolled here as soon as I was able. I knew what I wanted to do and set about doing it.\" Bastian nodded, turning to Khail with a shit-eating grin before he turned back to him. And Sphinx suddenly wondered what was going on between the two that he was the subject. Honestly didn't they get in enough trouble at the damn tux fitting? \"You do know that Chaosia went through a lot of the courses for the same degree right? I mean she was in the very end of her third year of Medical School when she decided to do her art . . .\" Sphinx nodded, trying not to roll his eyes at Bastian's attempt at civil conversation. The boy was odd even to come from the truly weird noble house he was a member of. But at least he wasn't out right snubbing him in favor of lamenting how horrible it was his sister was marrying him period. Thankfully he hadn't really had to deal with that with any of Chaosia's family yet . . . but he wasn't going to hold his breath. Chaos and Mikhail had both warned him that Bastian's moods turned faster than even Selene's, part of the reason neither particularly cared to deal with him. Hell, his wife had almost beaten him to death over Jacqueline . . . He shook himself, glancing to the others at the table. Augustus looked shocked to hear about Chaosia's education. He raised a brow. Now why in the world was that? Khail however just grinned, chuckling as he turned to Memphis with a wink. And Sphinx knew he was in trouble as soon as the boy opened his mouth by the way Augustus and Bastian both perked to listen. \"Dude now you know how I felt when I found out he was a freaking doctor.\" Augustus raised a brow, turning to him in confusion before turning back to Khail. \"You didn't know? I thought the lot of you were close . . .\" Memphis grinned, fielding the question appropriately as Guadimus raised a brow and lit a cigar; shaking his head at Bastian's almost enrapt look. He was paying far too close attention for them to be sloppy . . . if he found out they ran it would just cause more drama and issues than he could deal with. At least until after the bloody wedding. Why hadn't he just listened to Chaosia and eloped again? \"We all painted a pretty grizzly picture about his work when we heard the word 'morgue'. No one really wanted to ask anything else . . . and he isn't really that talkative if you haven't noticed.\" Sphinx snorted, giving Raines a dark glare as the man laughed. But Bastian seemed to perk even more, grinning as he turned to Augustus as he nodded skeptically. And Sphinx knew that his brother hadn't bought Raines little move even in the least. Damn it where were Chaosia or Atley when you needed them? He glanced to Guadimus as he snorted, shaking his head as he took a long drag from his cigar; not really seeming too interested or shocked by what was going on around him. God please let the food come quickly . . . . Atley watched Jacqueline walk around the last loft they had to visit for the day, the girl moving slowly as she took in every bit of the detail and architecture of the space with an occasional nod and a knowing smile. And even though he knew he was in for a world of hurt if she did he hoped she got this unit. It wasn't even four blocks from his own place. Hell he could walk here if he had to . . . He smiled at the thought before he shook himself and turned back to Chaos and Paul. The two maniacs were still chattering away with the real estate agent, the same pretty blonde from before much to his chagrin. And even though she was still absolutely gorgeous-and kept giving him sinful little smirks- his eyes kept straying right back to Jacqueline. Just like he seemed to stay closer to her than the other three. He sighed, running a hand over his hair as he leaned back against the exposed brick half wall that separated the living and dining areas of the front of the loft; glancing down at his clothes before he shook his head. He looked ridiculous but Chaosia had sworn he needed to dress this way . . . and Lord knew that if anyone could make a boost look human than it was her. God he'd seen the way she'd dressed Sphinx to go and grab up his brother. The man that had waltzed into Otto's hadn't even resembled his stoic and sinister friend. Well until he'd glared and sent all of the kids-safe Toby and Mikhail- scurrying for cover that is. He picked at his shirt, smoothing the dark blue material down a bit straighter before he readjusted the simple but expensive black leather belt looped through the pressed black trousers. Hell, Chaos had even gotten him into a pair of black leather shoes . . . but one thing that bothered him was where she'd gotten all of it. He'd shown up in a pair of nice jeans and one of his own button down shirts, intent to go out the way he was before he'd been attacked by the makeover queen and his evil harpy of an assistant. He shuddered, trying not to remember how damned close Paul had come to his neck with those huge shears. Chaosia had been right before . . . the man could very well be classified as a weapon of mass destruction if he were unleashed on the right people. Especially after enough caffeine and sugar. A hand on his arm brought his eyes up and locking with Jacqueline's, the girl giving him a worried look as her other hand reached out and barely touched his now clean shaven cheek. She'd let her hair fall around her in big loose waves today, her fringe bangs covering most of her forehead while any makeup she had on seemed natural. And her cheeks still had that same damn glow to them that they'd had before. She was wearing one of Chaosia's flowier cream shirts with this ruffled side and all of these different colors bleeding together down the side with a pair of cuffed light washed jeans and sky high true green silk stilettos. And even with the damned heels she only came to his chin . . . reminding him once again just how damn tiny she actually was. He swallowed the lump in his throat, shaking himself before he worked to answer the question she'd just asked him. Now if he'd only been able to hear it over the sound of his own galloping heart. She sighed, smiling at him sadly as she went to pull away; and he had no clue what possessed him but he reached up and kept her hand against his cheek, smiling to her as she looked to him. She blushed, looking down before glancing back up at him through her lashes. \"It isn't that boring is it? You've been staring out the window for almost ten minutes now . . .\" Atley felt his cheeks flush before he shrugged, giving her his best lopsided grin as he leaned a little heavier on the wall. He glanced to where the others had been, furrowing his brows when he saw they weren't there anymore. And that he didn't hear them. Oh great if he'd lost Sphinx's wife he was going to get broken over the rack. Jacqueline however giggled, nodding her head towards the front door of the apartment. \"They went to go get the forms . . . apparently Chaosia and Prometheus spoke before we came out today. Whatever I decided she was to get as soon as she could. As long as all of this goes well then I'll be moving in while Chaosia is gone on her honeymoon.\" Atley perked, trying not to grin like a madman as he nodded to her. Well that was at least good news. Until he remembered he wasn't going to get anywhere with all of this. No now it was horrible news. God what was wrong with him? He shook himself, deciding to just talk and see where it went. God it couldn't be any worse than what he was doing now, standing here and not talking like the fucking Sphinx. \"Well that's great, girl. This is a pretty good neighborhood. Hell, I live about four blocks east of here . . . Got any idea what you're going to do with the place?\" She blushed darkly, shaking her head before turning to look out the large windows in the living room. And in the afternoon sun shining through Atley could honestly say he'd never seen anything more beautiful. \"Not a bloody clue. I don't even know how much all of this is going to cost. Prometheus was insistent that I let Chaosia handle all of it . . . but she's got so much going on as it is. I mean, planning a wedding and having Augustus with her.\" Atley raised a brow, seeing a chance to focus on something other than his newfound love struck puppy disposition. He stepped a little closer to her, letting her hand fall from his cheek before he squeezed it and kept it in his own. She blushed a bit darker but let him keep her, smiling up to him softly as he spoke. \"What's his deal? I really haven't had much to do with him yet . . . he isn't going to cause trouble is he?\" Jacqueline shook her head, glancing around before she looked back to him. And he could see some of the socialite peeking through as she spoke about Sphinx's brother. But even though she was gossiping he still found himself listening to every word . . . and he wasn't stupid enough to think it was because she was talking about Augustus. God he was in trouble here. Big, big trouble. \"Augustus is the youngest son of the House of Dashell . . . from the former Lord Lucian's second marriage. His oldest son from his first wife was supposedly sent off to boarding schools overseas and decided he liked the life of a commoner over that of a member of nobility. At least that what everyone has always claimed . . . My mother has always said she didn't much believe it though.\" Atley raised a brow, leaning in as he asked her, \"Why wouldn't she? If that's what the family claimed.\" Jacqueline shook her head, leaning in closer to whisper. \"That's just it, the family never claimed anything. The stories around the man's abandonment of his title were always from the servants or other houses. Every time someone would ask Augustus or Celeste-his mother- they would always deny it or just plain out change the topic. Neither ever spoke of it . . . and Bastian told Prometheus once that Augustus hadn't seen the man since he was a small child, the last time he'd come home from school to visit.\" Atley looked her over, glancing back to the doorway as they heard voices creep closer. \"Are you sure about all of this? I mean, I've known Sphinx for years . . . he isn't one to just run away from something because he didn't want to do it. Freak out and act like an ass yeah but he sticks by what he's committed to.\" Jacqueline paled, shaking her head quickly as she glanced to the door. \"Oh no! No, no, no. That's not what I meant . . . I see how loyal he is and how dedicated he is to the life he's made here, Atley. I agree with my mother. He was pushed out by Celeste to make way for Augustus. So her son could be the Lord of an influential house. There was even a rumor among the Ladies a few years before Augustus took his seat that she'd been lobbying hard to have Lucian's first marriage declared null. That way if her stepson ever did resurface he wouldn't be able to claim his seat or inheritance.\" Atley felt his blood run cold as a million things about his friend suddenly made sense. His aversion to other people in general, not wanting to form lasting ties-until recently that is- and even some of his habit of not speaking. Christ if he were coming from something like that . . . he turned to Jacqueline as she shook her head slowly, resting her free hand on her swelling stomach. And Atley could suddenly see why Sphinx was content to follow Chaosia where she was concerned. He and her kid were pretty much in the same damn boat. He sighed, shaking his head as he reached out and laid his hand over hers on her belly; letting her other hand fall to tilt her chin up so she was looking at him. \"Hey stop with the long face doll. You're here now . . . and even if all of the rumors and stuff are true Sphinx is definitely getting the better deal. He's living his life instead of being told what to do. The same gift your own little one has now. Things 'ill work out, you'll see. Now stop looking so damn sad. You're too pretty to frown.\" Jacqueline laughed, shaking her head as he grinned at her. Ad he was happy that he'd managed to cheer her up. But when he turned back to her to tell her they needed to go she caught him off guard, pressing her lips to his cheek lightly. She pulled away before he could even react, blushing darker than he'd ever seen her as she spoke to him. \"Thank you Atley . . . you really are a sweet, sweet man. I hope that we can find someone like you . . .\" Chaosia's voice filled the apartment, obviously full of mirth as she practically slid to a stop in front of Jacqueline. And even though Atley could see how funny and damn right cute the scene was he couldn't shake himself out of his stupor. Even when Paul came and flicked his shoulder, asking him what was wrong. He shook his head to the blonde, moving to leave as Jacqueline and Chaosia started talking about furniture. She wanted someone like him . . . had kissed him-even if it was on the damned cheek but still! - . . . Dear God what did he do now? Chaosia turned from the muffins she was making as she heard heavy footfalls coming from the direction of the garage, expecting to see Sphinx moving into the kitchen. At least she could tell him that everything was fixed at the venue and all they had to worry about now-other than just trying to survive the guest list- was the rehearsal dinner in twelve days' time. But she had to blink and shake herself when Augustus trudged in, running a hand over his face warily. She raised a brow, watching him move through the room slowly before he made his way into the living room. Almost like a zombie . . . or a kid that didn't want to go to school-same thing in her opinion. She sighed, wiping her hands on a dish rag before she moved to follow him, not at all surprised to find him sprawled on her longest sofa with one leg dangling off the end. She rolled her eyes before moving to get him. God he and Sphinx may not look alike but she was starting to see a slew of little behaviors they shared. The largest their bad habits of just flopping on her furniture. Something two well-over-six-foot-tall and one-hundred-eighty-pound-plus men did not need to do. She reached out, patting his calf before she spoke to him. \"Augustus are you okay? What's wrong? And where is Sphinx?\" He looked at her before he gave a long suffering sigh, pushing into a sitting position as he slung his feet to rest on the floor. Where they belonged in the first damn place. She sighed, sinking into the seat beside him as she watched him clasp his hands listlessly in front of him; his shoulders sagging even more as he sighed. Okay now this was something she'd never seen the sarcastic and bored Lord do before. Something was wrong . . . She laid her hand on his shoulder, looking to him expectantly as she pushed for answers again. \"What's wrong honey?\" He turned, looking to her before he stood; moving down the hall to the guest bedroom slowly. She straightened, blinking as she realized he'd just left her there when she'd been trying to help him. She felt herself start to get angry before he came back in a few seconds later, a thick bundle of what looked like letters secured by a black ribbon in his hands. He shifted, thumbing the yellowing paper nervously as he stood before her; head dipped and shoulders still sagging. \"Ignatius- Sphinx had to run some errand with his friend Jackson . . . but Chaosia I need to-\" He took in a breath, looking up to her with fretful eyes before looking back down to the letters. \"I found these in my Mother's things after I talked with you . . . and I need to make things right with him. I didn't even know he'd tried to . . .\" She pushed to her feet, laying her hands on his as she dipped to look at him. \"That he'd tried to what, Augustus? What in the world are you going on about?\" He sighed, pushing the letters carefully into her hands before he handed her the other small bundle of papers he'd had under them. And she recognized what they were right off the bat. She looked up before shaking her head, trying to pull away as he stopped her. She'd seen the family writs like that when her grandmother had her inducted as a full member of their house when she was sixteen. But there in the top against the faded and brittle parchment was the same damn shield that had started all of this mess . . . with her future husband's full name beneath it in the sprawling script. She looked back up at him with a sigh before she led him towards the media room. By God if she was going to have to look at all of this then she was going to have a drink. And the bottle her father had sent over earlier seemed as good a place to start. Sphinx glanced around his home, looking for any sign of his wife or half-brother as he shrugged out of his coat. He'd gone out with Atley again, helping the man scoop up a newer Corvette just to do it. And they'd talked-well Atley had rambled and he'd been forced to listen-about Jacqueline and how he planned to move in slowly. He snorted, rolling his eyes. He gave it about two days before the man was back and begging Chaosia to help him plan some wonderful date for the girl so he could sweep her off her feet. Sphinx chuckled at all of the ways he and Chaosia could have fun with that before he shook his head. He would only be hateful if Jackson insisted on going to the damned club he'd picked for his bachelor party. Because his idea of living up his 'last night of freedom' as Raines had taken to calling it wasn't going and sitting in a loud, crowded club with a mass of people half his age and drunk off of their asses. Hell, he would consent to the strippers before he'd willingly go to a damn club. But he knew that despite her stellar performance before Chaosia wasn't as okay with the lot of them going out and whoring it up. Actually he was pretty sure he'd wake up minus a head . . . or at the very least a testicle. Besides why would he want to endure a strip club with both of her and his brothers? That was practically begging for trouble he neither needed nor wanted. He moved through the kitchen, raising a brow at the bowl of mix sitting on the counter before he shook his head. She must be on the phone upstairs to have completely forgotten about the muffins she'd been eating nonstop the past few days . . . He shrugged, moving up the steps and pushed the door to the Media Room open. Only to bite back a sigh as he saw her with a very familiar bottle of scotch and what looked like enough paper to have been a rainforest scattered on the ottoman in front of her. But what made him raise a brow was how Augustus was slumped into the chair across from her, snoring away with his head titled back. Had he honestly come up here to keep her company while she worked? Because if he had then he was definitely earning himself brownie points. Hell even he knew better than to come near her when she was working on a case or some side project . . . He shook his head, moving to take the bottle when she stopped him, grabbing his arm in a pretty tight grip as she shook her head. Never bothering to lift her eyes from the papers before her as she spoke. \"You and I have a lot to talk about Sphinx. And you're going to want that about halfway through . . .\" He raised a brow, tugging free before looking down at the papers she was so enthralled with. Only to want to wretch as he realized exactly what they were. That was his handwriting sprawled across the yellowed paper . . . and his name signed to the bottom of most of the ones he could see. He turned, looking to Augustus as he moved in his sleep; resituating before he started snoring again. But before he could get angry Chaosia stopped him, tugging him into the sofa beside her and pushing the bottle into his hands with a sigh. He took it, draining a good bit of the scotch as she spoke to him. \"He found them after he talked with us . . . and he wanted to bring them. Only a few had even been opened before he gave them to me . . .\" Sphinx shook his head, sitting the bottle down a bit harder than he meant to as he turned to lock eyes with Chaosia. He wasn't doing this . . . not now and not ever. He'd been steadily making peace with all of this and he wasn't going to hash through it aloud. Not even with her. \"Give them back or burn them. I don't care . . . But I don't want to see them, Chaosia. I mean it.\" She rolled her eyes, picking the bottle up and taking a swig before she passed it back to him. Right as she handed him what looked like a particularly long letter with a pointed look. He glared at her before looking at the bloody thing. Only to drop it like he'd been burnt as he saw what it was. He looked back up to her as she gave him a smug look, shaking her head as she smirked. \"Still want me to burn them, Ignatius?\" He glowered at her before picking it back up, tracing his mother's signature below his father's on the writ. God he'd thought his birth certificate was destroyed along with every other piece of his mother . . . but here it was. With her name right below his. He glanced back up as Chaosia handed him something else, the seal at the top announcing it was an official document like the other before it. But he couldn't believe it . . . If this was true then Celeste hadn't succeeded in taking everything from him. But she'd still exiled him from his home and his family . . . Chaosia's arms wound around his shoulders as she pressed her forehead to his temple. And he could feel the hot tears falling from her eyes and cheeks to his own. He reached up, catching her latched hands in one of his as he sagged into her. If the bitch weren't already dead he would kill her himself. He set the papers aside with shaking hands before he tugged Chaosia into his lap, letting her wrap around him completely as he rested his head in the crook of her neck. This was too bloody much to try and take in at once. Chaosia pulled back, cupping his face as she looked him over. And with her next words he found himself getting even angrier than he had before. How in the hell did she expect him to do that? To just act like everything was okay? His whole adult life had been filled with strife and hardship when it shouldn't have been . . . and the woman had effectively made a stranger out of the only blood family he had left. She'd destroyed both of their lives with her own selfish ambitions . . . and that wasn't even taking into account what had happened to his mother. \"You need to settle this baby. Make peace with it and bury it . . .\" He went to move but she stopped him, settling deeper into his lap as she forced his face back to hers. And he hated to admit that she was right in what she told him. But that didn't mean he was going to do it. \"I know it's hard and it isn't fair. But Sphinx if you don't do this then it's going to overshadow everything else baby. I don't want that for you. I want you to be happy. To be as at peace as you have been the past few days . . . You deserve that. Just like you deserve the opportunity to know your family.\" He sighed, looking away before he spoke to her. God it was hard to say this-to admit it aloud even to her-but he had to make her understand. To see that he couldn't do what she was asking. \"I can't Chaosia. She did so much damage, destroyed so much more than either of you knows. I can't make peace with that. No child ever could . . .\" She bit her lip, staying quiet a few long moments before she sighed. And he knew that her next words would be to renounce him. But she just nodded and leaned into him, pressing a kiss to his cheek before she spoke. \"I understand that baby. And I love you regardless of what you do . . . you know that. Just promise me that you won't make your brother pay for the sins of his parents. He's not perfect but he's your family. I mean hell, I can love Bastian. Just . . . give him a chance okay? Judge him on his own actions and merit. The same way I did you . . .\" Sphinx glowered at her, seeing the dirty trick she'd pulled but he nodded just the same. He couldn't renounce the boy on the fact of who his mother was alone now . . . not with her having said that. Chaosia however smiled, leaning in to kiss him again lightly as she held him. \"I love you, Ignatius. More than anything else in the world . . . you're a good man honey.\" He looked up at her, rolling his eyes before he leaned into her next sweet kiss. And he knew he was telling the truth when he answered her. \"Only with you, Chaosia. Only with you . . . stop bloody calling me that. You know I-\" She cut him off, slanting her mouth against his heatedly before she tugged him even closer. Leaving him breathless with a spinning world when she pulled away. God she hadn't kissed him like that since after their fight in November . . . He cupped her face, bringing her lips back down to his. \"I'm practically your wife, Sphinx. Who else should get to call you your real name than me?\" He rolled his eyes, kissing her jaw and neck as she tilted her head for him. And just as he went to answer her teasing little quip a loud snore sounded from the chair in front of them, reminding him that they weren't alone. He groaned, resting his head on her shoulder as she giggled and held him. God why was it every time he wanted to thoroughly enjoy her someone else was almost always around these days? She gave him a peck on the cheek, shaking her head as she went to stand up. \"C'mon baby. Let's go to bed okay? Do you have anything planned tomorrow?\" He stopped before he nodded once, scooping her up and making his way towards the stairs back to the main portion of their home. He had plans for tomorrow alright. He was going to ship his brother off with the Guadimus family for most of the day and thoroughly enjoy his future wife. Hell, he might even let her persuade him back to the bloody water . . . Probably not but he would let her try. And then he was going to enlist Atley and Memphis to help teach Augustus as much as they could about cars. He'd caught the boy's little moment earlier but hadn't let on. Chaosia wanted him to get to know him . . . well the Malibu and Eleanor seemed as good a place to start as any. And there we have it! A little more about Augustus and Sphinx's past . . . and why they're so damned weird around one another.[Chapter 50] And even though its short here's the thrid part of the update. THis should keep everyone busy for like . . . three seconds right? Hope you enjoy it and thank you all for the support and prayers. It means the world to me. Moving On or Something Close Augustus watched Sphinx move around the kitchen of his home cautiously, taking in every slow movement the other man made. Because there was no way in Hell he was seeing what he thought he was. His brother wasn't in the bloody kitchen making breakfast for the three of them like it wasn't anything. Not after what he'd brought out last night . . . Sphinx moved, dropping the frying pan into the half-filled sink before he turned back to collect the omelets he'd made. And Augustus knew that his was probably laced with arsenic or even cyanide. So what if he didn't see the man mix it into the whipped eggs and various bits he'd tossed together. He knew the man wasn't okay with everything . . . or at least not okay enough to be cooking. Sphinx turned, taking in his expression with a raised brow before he shook his head; placing a rather large omelet in front of him and a container of what looked like diced tomatoes. He looked at the plate before looking back up as his brother moved back to the sink. Okay now this was just too surreal. Finally he had enough and went to speak, to ask what in the hell was going on when Chaosia stepped into the room. He blinked, shaking his head as his future sister-in-law grinned and moved to wrap her arms around Sphinx's waist; stretching to her tiptoes and pressing a kiss on his cheek before she moved away. Only to laugh as Sphinx caught her and tugged her back, cupping her face in one of his hands as the other settled on her denim clad hip. Augustus shook his head, watching the two together before he turned. It was so odd to see the way Ignatius was with her and the way he was with everyone else. Almost like two completely different people . . . but he knew their father had been much the same way with his own mother. From what little he remembered of Lucian Dashell the man was always stern and stoic around other people. But in private he'd doted on him and his mother the same way Sphinx seemed to dote on Chaosia . . . and suddenly Augustus wondered if the man had been the same way with his first wife. He sighed, shaking himself from his thoughts as Chaosia spoke to him; jarring him back to the present and away from the melancholy that was trying to settle now that the shock was wearing off. He blinked; looking to Chaosia perplexed as he finally noticed what she was wearing-hell what both of them were wearing. What in the hell were they doing now? The girl was wearing a pair of denim shorts that were borderline indecent even with the almost innocent little stitched designs over the left pocket and a simple light blue button down oxford shirt with the sleeves cuffed to her elbows. But the thing that threw him was that she wasn't wearing any of the jewelry or makeup he was accustomed to seeing her in. Actually other than her massive rings and the key necklace he'd yet to see her shed the outfit was overly casual. And her brown leather flip flops on her feet actually let him see she barely came to Ignatius's chest without the heels he was used to. Sphinx however was in something he didn't think any male member of their family had ever worn willingly. Shorts. Oh sure they came down past his knees and looked to be football shorts-black of course- but he was shocked to see his brother out of the layers he seemed to thrive in. The tight black under armor tee shirt was barely stretched across his chest and shoulders, showcasing just how massive the man actually was. And a good many of the seemingly random tattoos he had. Augustus looked to his arm, cocking his head to the side before he shook himself. His brute of a brother had a rose tattoo on his arm . . . \"Aren't you going to eat, Augustus? You're going out with Bastian while we're gone. You know you'll need all of the energy you can get.\" Augustus looked up, shocked before he turned to look at Igna-Sphinx. The man nodded, picking up his coffee cup from the counter and leaning against the cabinets. And Augustus suddenly felt like a child being sent off to relatives. \"Where exactly are the two of you going then? Running away before the planes touch down?\" Sphinx smirked as Chaosia's face fell, crossing her arms in a huff even as her love tugged her into his side and rubbed her shoulders reassuringly. Augustus shook his head, taking a tentative sip of the coffee that had been set before him. He would've preferred tea but he'd noticed that both of the owners of the household practically inhaled the darker brew. So he would just have to make do. He wasn't-however-prepared for Chaosia's next words. \"Oh don't even remind me. I still don't see why we had to do all of this massive wedding shit.\" Augustus choked before sputtering, almost hitting both of them as Sphinx glared at her. She wasn't honestly serious was she? He'd been under the impression-from both Bastian and Selene-that the girl was almost manic over planning this extravaganza. And that they'd had to step in and force a wedding planner down her throat to keep her from freaking out any more than she already was. But the girl seemed to be the exact opposite of her relations' claims as she just snorted at his brother's words, continuing on like she wasn't testing his nerves. Letting Augustus see that Mikhail had been right before. The girl really was too damned hardheaded for everything to continue to go as smoothly as it had been. And his brother seemed to be right there with her. \"Oh don't even bloody start that shite again, Chaosia. You've been planning all of this for months. And despite what you say now I know you want a proper wedding.\" She rolled her eyes, turning away from him completely before she continued to grumble. \" I wanted to elope . You wanted a proper wedding .\" Sphinx rolled his eyes, throwing his hands in the air before he shook his head. And Augustus saw a part of them he knew few others did. Even bickering and fighting he could see how careful his brother was of the girl, how he watched her and made sure she was never too far away. And even as careless as his words sounded he knew the older man was actually trying not to be an asshole. He sighed, trying to drink his coffee again as they quarreled. At least the sharp sarcasm seemed to be something they both shared . . . and that Chaosia could-and would- stand against if she had to. \"I want a proper wedding because it's what you need to have peace. Besides, I've seen the way you keep flitting around with Paul and Jacqueline. You're excited about all of it. So don't even try to say you're not.\" She stilled before shrugging, her shoulders sagging as she gave him an almost repentant smirk. That was followed by a statement that made him have to bite his tongue. Oh she was horrible . . . and his brother seemed to love every damn second of it despite his current exasperation. This settled it, they were crazy and perfect for one another. \"Okay . . . maybe a little. But look at it this way . . .\" Sphinx rolled his eyes, stepping closer and tugging her into him; resting his hands on her hips as hers slid up the smooth shirt to loop around his neck. Letting Augustus see just how damned opposite they looked. She didn't seem dark enough to stand against him-especially with the lighter hair. And sphinx seemed far too wicked to be so at home with her. But they still managed to complement one another . . . and not kill themselves in the process. \"And what way is that? The insane way?\" She rolled her eyes, shrugging her brows before she grinned; stretching up and onto her tiptoes and nipping his chin with her teeth. Something that made Sphinx growl and curse under his breath before he shook his head at her. \"Nope. We got the argument over everything out of the way for the time being. Meaning that we should have a pretty peaceful day . . . well, until we meet the others anyway.\" Augustus cleared his throat, trying to break the tension looming in the room as his brother glared at the still smiling girl. God why did everyone think it was funny to aggravate his brother near to death? Did they all have death wishes or something? \"Um . . . exactly where are the two of you going again? And when do you expect to be back? I don't mind spending time with Bastian-actually it'll be nice so long as Selene isn't around- but I don't relish staying all bloody day.\" Chaosia laughed, shaking her head as Sphinx rolled his eyes; lips moving as he grumbled to himself while the girl explained their plans for the day. And suddenly he wanted to desperately go with them despite the tension still simmering between him and Ignatius. It had to be better than what they had planned for him. \"Oh he didn't tell you? Bastian and Khail have a bet that he could work on a car just as well as anyone else. So Daddy and Memphis are going to be there to mediate and instruct until they think that Bastian might be able to do something small. Until Daddy has to leave anyway. After that it'll just be you guys. And Sphinx and Atley will probably show up eventually.\" Augustus nodded before he furrowed his brows. Wait a bloody minute . . . \"But you still didn't tell me where you're going. Am I not supposed to know?\" Sphinx rolled his eyes, dropping into the seat beside him with his own plate and fresh cup of coffee as he shook his head. While Chaosia reached into the basket off to the side and plucked out a plump blueberry muffin; sinking into her future husband's lap and popping half of the massive thing into his mouth before she turned to answer him. \"Oh I'm taking him with me for a little while. I have a few things to move around my office at the Jeffersonian before I leave for wherever we're going on our honeymoon.\" Sphinx gave her a pointed look before shaking his head, spearing a juicy chunk of the spinach and cheese omelet he'd already smothered in the tomato mess. He held the fork up, letting Chaos take the massive bite while she rolled her eyes. Chiding her while she chewed. \"He doesn't bloody know either so don't even try to dig for information. I didn't tell anyone you can bribe.\" She cut her eyes to him, brow raised before she shrugged; feeding him another piece of muffin before she looked back to Augustus. \"Uh huh. You forgot love-of-my-life that I have weapons at my disposal you don't. I know you told Atley . . .\" Sphinx raised a brow, cutting off another portion of his omelet and offering it to her before he began feeding himself. But Augustus could almost count down the time between his next comment. It was all like a dance between the two of them, a waltz of words and bickering littered with kisses and little touches . . . something he had honestly never seen before. Even his own parents weren't this relaxed with one another. \"So? Atley's loyal to a fault, Lover. Not even you and Paul together could get him to crack.\" She grinned, dipping to kiss his cheek before she slid off his lap; laughing as she darted from the room as her words sunk in for both of them. And as soon as they had Sphinx was up and after her, growling and griping as she cackled. And even he had to choke at the sound his brother made in response to her next little comment. Okay now he could kind of see why she kept aggravating him . . . it was far too interesting to hear the usually reserved and serious man growl like a bloody bear. \"Oh but baby . . . I don't need Paul for this one. I have Jacqueline .\" Prometheus let out a long sigh before he killed the engine to the gleaming black One-77. He knew he'd promised Chaosia and Sphinx he would be on hand today to mediate between his wayward sons but damnation he'd almost rather be at the house welcoming the guests. Almost. He stepped out of the car, straightening his black tee shirt and adjusting the jeans he'd drug from the depths of his closet almost nostalgically. God it was so odd to actually be in something other than trousers and suits and loafers that he almost felt naked. But then again he was sure that most of his older friends thought he looked ridiculous in the suits he was at home in now. He shook himself, running a hand through his dark hair before he pulled his cigars from his pocket. The only good thing about any of this-other than getting to spend time with his children regardless of the headache they caused- was that he'd been told he could smoke. As much as he wanted. He turned, lighting the cigar he'd brought to his lips as he watched three cars pull into the back lot a few seconds behind one another. These had to be Sphinx and Mikhail's other friends . . . The ones he wasn't supposed to know did anything illegal. He rolled his eyes before examining each car critically, trying to learn as much as he could from the start. He wouldn't be much a parent if he didn't know who his stepson and baby girl were involved with . . . and even though the information had cost him more than a few favors and a small fortune he'd known everything there was to know about all of the people that frequented Otto Halliwell's little shop before Chaosia had ever even agreed to marry the man. The gleaming Shelby GT500 Mustang pulled in close to Millennia , the doors opening and a tall almost lanky man stepping out. The man stopped, looking at him carefully before he shrugged and moved closer; extending his hand with a friendly but guarded smile while the other two parked. And Guadimus had to admit that the sleek black 72 Jaguar E Type Convertible and the gleaming dark blue 73 Corvette Stingray hardtop that pulled in to the other side of the Shelby were gorgeous. Something he knew his stepson wouldn't be able to resist. He shook himself, taking the man's hand with a warm smile as he introduced himself. \"Hi there. I'm Randal Raines . . . but everyone calls me Memphis. Can I help you with something sir?\" He smirked, letting the boy's hand drop before he pulled the clove from his lips; ashing on the pavement as he spoke. \"Actually you just might be able to. I'm looking for Mikhail and Bastian. I kind of promised my daughter I'd babysit her brothers while she was gone.\" Memphis stopped, seemingly shocked before they both turned to the taller black man that walked up behind them; adjusting his hat as he grinned. \"You're Chaosia's dad? For real? Man I thought you were gonna show up in a suit and everything like Augustus . . . Kinda figured it was like a rule or something. Hell we haven't seen that guy in anything but suits and slacks yet, have we Memphis?\" Memphis shook his head, grinning as they both turned to watch the third man walk by. Guadimus grinned, trying not to laugh at the dower look Atley Jackson was wearing. He'd been introduced to the other runner when they'd come about Jacqueline. And though he hadn't spent too much time around him he knew his little girl thought the world of the older man . . . and that he was going to be Sphinx's best man in the wedding. He shook his head, turning back as Donnie grinned and chuckled. \"You have to ignore him, sir. He's been a mood for the past few days. You coming in with us?\" Guadimus nodded, tossing his now spent clove into the gravel and dirt at his feet before he waved his arm to let the other two pass first. He wasn't going to point out that he knew exactly what was wrong with their friend. Or that Chaosia had filled him in on everything that had transpired between the man and his stepdaughter yesterday like the good little spy that she was. No need to spoil all of the fun until he had to. \"After you lads. I'm just here in a supervisory capacity . . . to make sure that my sons don't try to kill one another before the fifteen minute marker as it were.\" Donnie laughed as Memphis shook his head, moving ahead of them. And as he stepped inside, looking over the garage and all of its components-and the people coming out to introduce themselves or just to talk- Guadimus had to admit something to himself. Mikhail had been right to jump to this crew . . . and he'd flourished because of it. These people might not do everything purely legal but they seemed like a good enough lot. He knew he would have to keep an eye on everything until his girl was away on her honeymoon but from what he could tell his kids were going to be fine. Now if he could just find someone willing to put up with Bastian he might actually get some peace and quiet. Chaosia laughed, flopping back onto the blanket with a smile as Sphinx rolled his eyes. He hadn't known if this would be the best way for them to just unwind and relax but now he was glad he'd done it. He'd figured out when they were moving that Chaosia loved the beach . . . and she seemed to be more herself here in the sand than she had been in weeks. She rolled, propping up on an elbow as she grinned to him. He shook his head, reaching out and brushing her curls out of her face as she leaned into his touch; kissing his thumb when he brushed it over her lips. He knew he shouldn't be out here on the bloody beach, laying around in the sun with her but he couldn't seem to stop himself. They needed a day just to themselves-without Jacqueline or Augustus or her family and the crew- and by God they were going to have it. All of the bullshit they would hear about just disappearing be damned. She scooted closer, wrapping her arm around his waist as he draped his over her. She looked up at him through her lashes as she laid her head on his bicep, which prompted him to do the same. She sighed, tracing his cheek as she smiled at him softly. \"Thank you . . .\" He raised a brow, dipping closer to rub his nose against hers before he pressed a small kiss to the corner of her lips. \"For what, Love?\" She rolled her eyes, leaning up to kiss him again; letting her lips linger against his own for a few long moments before she pulled away. And began kissing down his jaw as she spoke to him. \"For being so sweet and stealing away with me today. I know you had things you needed to do.\" He shrugged his brows, pulling her tighter against him as his fingers started working through her curls. He'd taken her new lighter hair color like another one of her odd habits at first but now, here in the sun he could say that the dark blonde looked good on her. The almost whiskey color littered with tiny streaks of gold and honey. He shook his head, pressing a kiss to her cheek. \"Nothing that couldn't wait until tomorrow. Everything is pretty much set actually. Just waiting for the conformation for the tickets now. And no I'm still not telling you where we're going.\" She pouted at him as he chuckled, dipping to catch her puckered lip with his. She huffed before melting into him, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and threading her fingers through his hair. God he'd been right, they needed today something fierce. Eventually she pulled back, grazing his chin with her teeth before she settled against him with a contented sigh. But when he felt her shoulders start to tense he knew she was about to start talking. And more than likely about something he didn't want to visit today. \"Baby . . . can I ask you a question?\" He glanced down before nodding once, running his hand over her back as he settled in to look up at the clouds. He had a feeling deep in his gut that he wasn't going to like where this was going. But if she needed to get something off of her chest then he would listen. Hell she'd done more than enough of that for him over the past few weeks he could return the favor. \"Like you need to ask Love. What's bothering you?\" She stilled against him before she looked up, her bottom lip between her teeth as her eyes looked over his face. He shifted, propping up on his elbows as she glanced back down. Christ what was wrong? \"I . . . Jacqueline called this morning and let me know about her doctor's appointment. They did one of those new 3-D ultrasounds. To check and make sure everything is okay, you know with everything that happened. And they found something out.\" He raised a brow, dipping to look her over critically. She was skirting an issue here and he wanted to know what . . . why would she be evading something over this? \"And? What'd they find out?\" She glanced back up at him, her lips spreading into a small smile as she snuggled closer to him. \"She's having a boy. And she wanted to know, if we-well you mind if she gave the baby your name. We kind of talked about it and she wants to use Ignatius as the baby's middle name. And I told her I would ask . . .\" He blinked, truly shocked before he nodded dumbly. Why in the world . . . \"I don't mind but what in bloody Hell would make her want to name him after me?\" Chaosia rolled her eyes before she leaned up and kissed him, long and hard on the lips before she pulled back and laughed; patting his cheek with a grin. \"Because you silly man, she wants to. She wants him to be a part of our family as much as he will be hers . . . and she wanted to thank you for all that you- and your friends - have done for them. I mean you told me to call Donnie. You and Atley went and got our parents when they landed and you keep pushing Atley to her-even if she doesn't know that for a fact. You've done a lot for her and the little one.\" He blinked again before he rolled his eyes, dipping to slant his mouth over hers again. God he was marrying into the oddest mess of people in the world. But as Chaosia pulled away from him, jumping to her feet and dashing back to the waves laughing as she drug him with her he knew he didn't really mind. He was getting her in the process . . . he could deal with the rest of the loons. Hopefully anyway. And even though the third part is short and sweet here we have it. Three whole new chapters! Yay! Okay I'm a dork and I know it. Later. ","Summary":" *Okay, this is officially my first fanfiction ever published anywhere and seeing as how I'm current"}]
