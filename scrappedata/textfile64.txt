On my video, its never been so close to happening. I guess I was nervous because my eyes had been turning purple more than an average ender soul does. I woke up and I was screaming, but not a normal scream. An ender scream that made all warriors tremble with fear. I gazed at my mirror for about 10 seconds and that was it. I was stood in front of it. Teleporting was my weakness but in a way it helps. The edges of my eyes were deep purple. I jumped back from my mirror, I felt like a monster and I was. I put my human contacts in and set of to Cupquake's house, opposite my home. Sparklez and Sky were already there. I knocked. Sparklez had opened and tears of happiness were streaming down his face. -Time warp 5 hours back- Cupquake's POV: It kicked. The little human inside of my tummy kicked. I started giggling because I couldn't help myself. Sky groaned next to me. Then he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me on the forehead. I closed my eyes and relaxed. -2 hours later- I screamed out a cry of pain. Sky jumped and screamed too. \"What's wrong?\" He asked me nervously. \"SKY! IT'S COMING!\" I screamed back at him. Sky instantly knew what 'it' meant. The baby. He literally jumped out of bed and carried me like a baby onto the floor in the living room. I screamed even louder this time. Sky panicked then called Sparklez and told him to come over and help him. Sparklez was here in 5 minutes and knelt down beside me. Sky shouted \"THE HEADS COMING! SPARKLEZ WHAT DO I DO?!\" then ran over to the couch, breathing heavily. I cried as Sparklez was helping Sky to deliver it. It finally came out, tears rolling quickly out of my eyes like a fruit winder. Sky grabbed a towel and checked the baby. \"It's a girl!\" He cried. I was speechless. I was the happiest person on earth. Sparklez was wiping his eyes so much, red marks came up on his cheeks. He ran quickly to the loo. Sky put the baby in it's new cot and came to sit beside me. No words were spoken. He leaned in towards me and our lips met. For a LONG time. For the FIRST time in a LONG time! But it felt good. Ashley's POV: He let me in and I heard a little soft cry. I squealed quietly in excitement and walked over to Cupquake and gave her a hug. She was so happy and said she was relieved that it was out. I smiled at Sparklez.

Only the 'her' that is referred to in this. I wish I owned Ryan Reynolds, but alas, I don't. This little one-shot came to mind because I hate the fact that Connell is a bit of a dick, so here's my reason for him being that dick. Depending on people's reactions to this, I may turn this one-shot into an actual story. Peace and love, kids** The Closest Thing. \"How's your sister? Haven't heard from her in a while.\" he asked, lay flat out on his back beside the couch. Head tipped to the left, waiting for the answer he so desperately needed. Big hands twisted, remembering sensations the man thought he'd long since forgot. \"As far as I know, she's fine. Living the life in L.A.\" That wasn't the answer that he wanted, that he needed. Brown eyes fell closed, the line of thick, coal coloured lashes brushed the very top of his cheeks. His heart ached, even that brought things back. Bare skin burned with past memories, ones that he longed would be true again some day. \"That's good. I'm glad things are working out for her. Always said she'd go far…\" hand came up to his brow and wiped downwards, dragging at his lips and finally rubbing over his chin. \"You miss her, huh?\" ears heard the girl move, turning over on the couch cushions. She'd have more questions. He had to get out before she dragged up more heart break than she already had. \"I gotta go. Ronnie will be wondering where I am if I'm any later.\" He stood, gathering his jeans and shirt as he did, wishing to God he had never opened his mouth, just like he always did. Every time he asked, he hurt that little bit more. But the pain was the only thing he felt. Without it, he was numb, a shell of the man he had once been. Now he was nothing but an empty, desperate, broken-hearted scumbag. He preferred being that over nothing at all. \"Take it that's a yes.\" the girl accused him in that oh-so annoying tone she had. The same one her sister had whenever she was right and he was wrong, which was quite often. Only he didn't find it annoying back then, it was cute. He couldn't answer, just carried on tucking the shirt into the jeans that hung open on his hips. Why did he do this to himself? Why did he come here, or meet her in secret? He was falling for the illusion he had tricked himself into believing. Because it was easy to imagine it was someone else wrapped around him as he thrusted in and out with his eyes closed. She was waiting for an answer, but she knew before the question tumbled from her lips that she wouldn't get one. That made it worse, made it hurt more. Him missing her was all the proof she needed to say that even she was just a memory of what once was. Everyone always said the two could have been twins if it weren't for the ten years between them. Same dark hair, same pale blue eyes, same pretty face. Sisters. Blood. They shared everything when they were younger. She would get her old clothes, toys…even now when she was so far away, she was still sharing things. Her room, her music and one that she had no idea about. The one thing she thought that even with the miles between them, was still only hers - him. But no, the younger had wanted him just like she had wanted everything else of hers and he was easy to take. Tempting him with things that reminded him of who he wanted by his side. Even tonight, the record she played was one of hers. Taste of Cindy by Jesus and Mary Chain. It was one of their many songs. One that would take him back to the first time he entered an inviting, warm and loving bedroom for reasons other than to watch movies. From her place she watched him rush, looking all flustered and brooding at the same time. He was a good looking guy, she could understand the attraction that had been there between them. They'd been friends forever, sandbox love that never died; even now, states apart and after three years had past, the love was still there. The girl would never tell, but she still asked over him on the phone. How he was, if he still played, if he was still married. At first she told the truth, when nothing was going on between them but then the lies came and they came easy. Started with simple things like he stopped wearing the leather jacket she had bought him and he looked happy. When in reality he wore that damn jacket every day and he looked miserable. Then the big ones that would hurt came through, ones that would cut her deeper in hopes of pushing her out of love with him. She told her that he had stopped playing, that Ronnie was pregnant and they were blissfully happy. It hurt the way she wanted it to, but it never destroyed the love. Then she tried it the other way. When he asked she lied and took a twisted pleasure in watching the light behind his eyes dim, more and more with each one that dripped from her acidic tongue. She didn't ease him in though, dove straight in with the ones that would hurt. She had a new life, new friends and a new man. The latest one - she had started a band with the guy she met and they had been picked up by an independent label. That was their plan, the dream they had together from the moment he picked up a guitar and she found a microphone. She knew that would kill him and that night she had the best sex of her life. Now she was watching him leave. Watching him mentally damn himself for being so stupid as he slammed the front door. But why did she care so much? Why did she care that he still longed for the other. Why did she care that when he kissed her, moved inside her, his eyes were closed and he was thinking of the one he needed her to be? She had fallen for him; for the attention and the outlet he provided for her, that was why. Because really, she was just as damaged and as lonely as he was. When her sister left, she didn't just leave him, she left her too. Left her alone, in a house that was no longer a home. Thinking back over what had happened earlier, Connell felt his stomach turning. Felt the barbed wire that had tangled around his heart tighten that little bit more. Thumb swept over the photograph that he held so delicately in his large hands, as if it would rip or crease if he held any differently. Drunken, dewy eyes stared back at her. God, she was beautiful. The kind of unconventional beauty that people dismissed, but not him. No. He noticed her straight away at the tender age of four. Her long, dark, natural ringlet curls tumbling down her back. Heart shaped lips and piercing blue eyes. She was the only girl that didn't have cooties. He leant back into the couch and those same eyes looked around the dead space of the basement he had come to hide away in. Many years ago, it was a place they found relaxing, private and the only door with a lock on it. Down here, they could get lost deep within each other and not be disturbed. A fond, happy smile found his dry lips. Pulling and cracking them as he remembered that first day. People say you don't remember much from your childhood, but he could, clear as a bell. She wore a light pink dress, tiny roses decorated the material and the skirt flared out with layers and layers of white lace coming out from underneath. Buckled pink shoes in a matching shade and white pop socks with the lace around the top. The front of her hair on one side was pulled back with a clip and it shone like velvety melted chocolate in the sun. She was playing in the sandbox, alone with her toy ponies, getting that pretty dress dirty. But she didn't seem to mind as much as her Mother did. He had walked over, innocent and curious as to why she played alone when all the other kids were running around. At first he stayed quiet, sitting cross legged not far from where she was, watching her play with her oddly coloured ponies. He asked their names and she answered without looking up. The mint green one was Poppy, the lilac one was Lucky and the sky blue one didn't have a name yet. She looked up to him, face happy and content and asked him his; he answered shyly, wondering why she wanted to know. The sky blue one was then named Mike. They saw each other every day after that. Every day for 19 years without fail. When they were young they would see each other at the playground and then at school. Reaching their teens they still had school and crawling in and out of bedroom windows at night. When they started to date, more and more they would sneak out to be together. Their parents knew what they were up to. But they had been sleeping over at each others houses since they were children, both their Mom's had wedding plans drawn up by the time they were 17 and so weren't at all surprised when they announced that they were dating. They had been in love since that first day in the sandbox and had been falling further and further each day after. All of that seemed so long ago now. Connell still loved her, his heart would always be wherever she was. Yes, he loved his wife, but that was a different kind of love. Ronnie would always be second best; she came along when he was freshly wounded, craving for someone to love him the way he had been and she did. She worshiped the ground he walked on, adored him and because of that, he married her. Now he was stuck in a one way marriage, grasping at the one thing that reminded him of his past. Em. Her sister. Jackass... Now, even if she came home, she would never take him back. But she was the only thing he had left, except the photograph and that sky blue pony named Mike that he kept in his Mother's basement, along with all his memories, away from anyone that could taint them. Emily was her, only ten years ago and damaged. He could close his eyes and pretend it was three years ago, pretend that nothing had changed. Pretend she was her. The man scoffed at himself. What the hell was he doing, trying to justify cheating on his wife and screwing around with the younger sister of the girl he really loved. He took another swig from the bottle he had placed at his feet. Sting of whiskey burnt his throat and he savoured the pain because that was all he could feel. And for that reason, Connell knew that he wouldn't stop because if he did, he would feel nothing at all. When that happens, what's the point in living? Easy…she was. He would carry on in the hopes that one day, she would come home to him, but for now he would keep up with this wicked game. Why? Because Em might not be her, but she was the closest thing he was going to get. ","Summary":" ** Disclaimer: I own nothing. Only the 'her' that is referred to in this.

To Connell she was a conquest, to James, an empty shell to pour his romantic feelings into. It was safe there, in the neutral fog between them where she could stay numb, and so cold inside she wouldn't have been surprised to see her breath in the middle of July. To Em, it would always be Winter. But Joel was warmth. His friendship was like welcoming gentle embers to sit by, bask in...until the night he kissed her. Then there was fire, she was melting into him... a sudden painful crack in the ice surrounding her, needles in her heart as it struggled to feel again. She pushed away, gasping. \"Em?\" He stepped closer to her, she stepped back. \"Oh God, I'm sorry.\" She ran. For days she avoided Joel, but there was nothing to defend against when he looked at her, only a resigned acceptance. She couldn't tell him she was afraid that he made her feel. That she couldn't be with him because whoever he loved would have to live up to it or lose him. The Kiss had changed her. Em had been drifting for two years, and the only way back to Joel was to fight against the current that was dragging her away from him. Ending things with Connell had been so easy it was humiliating. In a few weeks, days even, he'd find someone to take her place. The break up with James had been messy. She'd underestimated him. She had to wanted to explain to Joel herself, and James had taken that from her. New York was a refuge. She was invisible, and there was no danger of feeling anything new, only the regret that the memories of Joel could bring. Two weeks later came the night of the miracle. The night he showed up at her door and handed her forgiveness in the rain. ","Summary":" Em had bounced between Connell and James for weeks, letting them each use her in their own ways.

Ella se había ido, se fue, meneando las caderas mientras lo hacía, los chicos aun la miraban, y ella sonreía con desgano. Claro, el con el impacto de un corazón roto. Sus amigos le habían dicho lo que pudo haber hecho mal, fue tal vez que se vestía con playeras de bandas y no a la moda, probablemente no le había gustado los rizos de su despeinado cabello, que sonreía torcidamente, o por el simple hecho de ser Virgen. A lo mejor fue todo eso. Si, fue un mal golpe para él, su novia había roto con él a tan solo once días de haber comenzado, Patético. Pero es que él no podía evitar ser así, no podía evitar el hecho de que le encantara Lou Reed y sus canciones de romance, no podía evitar creer en el amor, que el amor lo puede cambiar todo, no podía dejar de ser virgen a menos que fuera con su amor verdadero, no evitaba que no leyera Shakespeare, ni saberse aquellos versos de amor.

Instead I must make due with creating my own stories for them. Pardon my artistic license as I add a few characters here and there. Most people look back at their past experiences and sigh with content. All they remember is the times they did well: no regrets, no sorrows. There's only memories of hanging out with their friends on Saturday nights, going to the movies and eating popcorn. Not me. My entire life has been fucked since the day I entered eighth grade. It's like from that day, the world has just been a black hole, sucking out all of the good stuff and leaving me with shit. The day I started eighth grade was the beginning of many firsts. At the time, some of the things seemed pretty great, but now that my life's moved on, I feel like I should have been arrested for even existing. I really hope that some day, if some kid finds the crap that I'm writing down, maybe they'll think twice about doing what I did. That'd be great; a kid reads some stuff about fucking their life up and decides to not do any of these things. That would totally make my time writing this worthwhile. Cause otherwise I'd never be caught dead doing this. If anyone ever found out about this thing and read it, I'd fuck them up so badly, it would take a surgeon to fix them. And then I'd have to hide, cause I could never live down all the shit that would be said. Maybe it's not such a great idea to write crap when I'm totally buzzed. Then again, the Beatles got away with it: just look at all the crap they wrote and then turned into music that everyone loved. So maybe this isn't going to turn out so bad after all, if I can manage to write all this when I'm high. At least I don't have to write any of this by hand. My step-mom wants me to go to law school and move the fuck out of the house, so she got me a typewriter to type up application shit for schools to look at.

The girl he's had the crush on for the longest thought he was awkward. How freaking great. \"I'm joking man; but if you just eat one, it'll calm you down\" she said somewhat convincingly. He nervously took the weed cookie from her outstretched hand. She kept her eyes trained on him, as he took a cautious bite out of the cookie. He chewed it, and an accidental look of his disgust quickly passed through his features. \"Come on it's not going to be like the best cookies out there: take it like a man\" she teased lightly, a smile lighting up her features. Though she was joking, it effected him. \"Eat it all\" she dared him with a smirk. He took her challenge and snarfed down the cookie quicker than he usually did with other food.

She decided to leave her hair down, barely wearing any make up, and put on a t-shirt accompanied by shorts. She finished drinking her coke then threw the medium sized cup in the closest garbage pail. \"Well here goes nothing.\" Em muttered to herself as she enters a very plain office room where her interview would be. An older man is sitting at the table patiently. Em tries not to stare at the handsome man in front of her but can't seem to look away. She feels her heart beat faster and her hands begin to sweat. \"Hello Mr. Connell. My name is Emily, but please call me Em, how are you?\" Em asked, confidently. He glanced up from his paperwork, furrowing his brow in confusion. He obviously wasn't expecting someone as attractive as her, which is a little shallow on his part. The girls already working in the park were regular and average looking, but Em seemed to catch his attention right away. Mike Connell offered her an easy smile, running his eyes over her body and curves. \"I can't look at her like this\" He thought to himself. \"Hello, Emily.\" He said, quickly recovering from his weakness, \"I'm fine, thank you\" He put his hands together and motioned his potential employee to sit down. \"Please sit down, Emily, how are you doing today?\" Mike spoke as he dragged his fingers through his freshly washed hair. \"I'm very well, thank you, I heard you were looking for someone to work in the game area of your amusement park, is that correct?\" Em asked,, keep proper eye contact, good posture and getting right to business. Her thoughts, unfortunately, start to wander in different directions, concentrating on the gorgeous man sitting in front of her. Mr. Connell looked up a bit shocked from Em's professionalism. \"Yes, that's correct\" He said with a low, attractive chuckle. This only made Em weak in the knees. \"We don't really get a lot of people working in the game section of the park, so the help is very much needed\" He informed Em, with major hesitation in his voice. Em could have sworn she heard a little stuttering as well. Mike showed off a brilliant smile, characterizing himself as a nice guy, which he sometimes has trouble portraying. \"My other employee working in the game area is Cricket, she isn't one of my greatest employees but she makes us money. You should get alone with her fine\" He told Em, flashing his smile again. Through his years of hiring teenagers, he has had to learn to master the skill of being a relaxing boss. \"So are you married? Or single? Do you have any children?\" Em asked quickly as Mr. Connell's assistant handed her a freshly brewed coffee, which smelt amazing. Mike almost choked on his own coffee hearing Em getting so personal with him. \"This can't be a good sign\" He thought to himself instantly. \"Well actually Em, I just recently got divorced without any children\" He tried to keep it together in front of the young girl. 17 year old he clarified after peering at his files. \"Not a good sign at all...\" He finished his previous thoughts. \"Happens to the best of us\" Em answered. \"I just got out of a really horrible relationship too, but that's past news\" She straightened up in her seat and winked playfully. (Current outfit; exchange pants forshorts) albums/j466/MoonlightHeather/Adventureland/tumblr_lmoro6nhq21qfvtaqo1_ ?t=1341258799 Mike exhales deeply as he began to relax. For a reason he couldn't understand, he was relieved that she was living a single life. He shook his head, drumming in to his mind that she is only 17 years old. Reaching out gently, Mike laid his firm hand upon Em's without realizing the consequences of such a small action. \"Well I'm sorry for your unfortunate situation\" He said pulling away and clearly his throat professionally. \"About Cricket\" He continued. \"She's very unique. She is very flirtatious and lazy, but she's easy to get along with\". Em smiled at him with interest. \"You're hired if you're interested in the job\" Mike offered. \"I would love it! Thank you so much!\" Em exclaimed happily. Em jumped up without thinking and wrapped her arms tightly around Mike's midsection. His body tensed up as her heart sped up much faster than it was already beating. \"It's an honor to have you apart of the team, Emily\" Mike says with a deep smile. His body starts to relax in Em's arms, and wrapped his arms around her in return; with reluctance. His mind was running with thoughts of denial and unprofessional desires. \"Let me just get your uniform and I'll take you to meet the others\" Mike told Em attempting to pull away from her embrace. Mr. Connell came back shortly with a slimming dark blue and white uniform. Em took it from him and ran in to the bathroom to change. She fixed her hair, reapplied her make-up and sprayed on some expensive elegant perfume. Em ran back out to meet Mr. Connell; her hair flying in the breeze. \"How many days do we work Mr. Connell?\" It took a little while for Mike to respond; he was stuck in a daze from Em's entry. \"Well, Em\" Mike finally answered. \"Wow, the uniform fits you perfectly\". Em smirked at his comment as he started to blush heavily. . \"Okay, so, over there we've got the rides\" Mike explained as they stepped in to the park. \"Lisa's the one who works them. I don't know if she's here just yet. She has *quite* the reputation around here, just so you know.\" Mike looked around with a disappointed expression. That disappointment turned quickly in to frustration and minor anger. \"Over there we've got Bobby and Paulette, they kind of run the show here\" He continued through the park. \" Sue and Joel… you'll probably meet them later. I'm sure they'll take a shine to you, Em\". \"Over here, finally is Cricket\" Mike pointed towards the games where a young girl was sitting on the balloon counter making out heavily with a boy; just as young. \"Who's that guy she's with?\" Em asked, as curious as she was. \"That's Tommy, her boyfriend\" Mike answered, becoming red in the face from frustration. Before Em could say anything, Mike yelled out; \"That's enough! Break it up!\". Mr. Connell walked Em over to the sexually frustrated couple and quickly introduced her as the new employee. Em said hello politely and stayed cheerful. She smiled towards the couple gently. \"So what do you have to do in order to work?\" Em asked, feeling enthusiastic about her new job. \"Well, you'll be pretty much running the show, Emily. Manning the games, prizes, and the whole shebang.\" Mike softly placed his hand on Em's shoulder. \"I have a feeling that you're going to be my favorite. And I have a lot of faith in you.\" Em looked up in to his gorgeous eyes and became weak in her knees once again. She twirled hair around her finger and smiled back. \"Oh well...thank you Mr. Connell that means a lot to me I will do my best.\" Em blushed and couldn't help but notice how fast her heart suddenly started to beat. \"Care to join me for lunch? There's a wonderful Japanese place in town that I haven't been to in a really long time\" Em invited Mike, who seemed a little resistant. \"Well….\" Mike said, hesitantly. He covered most of his face from the midafternoon sunshine. \"My break is coming up and I am a bit hungry…\" He responded, half towards Em and half to himself. \"Let's go then!\" Em said happily, grabbing him by the arm and running towards her brand new black vintage 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454. \"Do you like my car? It was my birthday present from my parents and I absolutely adore it\" Em said loudly. \"It's very nice, Em\" Mike told her, taking in the car's body and insides. They drove 15 minutes east and a huge sign saying \"SOGO\" comes in to view, which is where Em parks the car. \"Here we are!\" She exclaims jumping out of the car and locking it. They are seated by a very polite waiter and order some sake right away while looking at the menu. \"It's a little expensive here, I must admit, but trust me when I say it's completely worth it\" Em said, taking Mike's hand in tot hers as she smiled at him. \"I trust your opinion, Em\" He said; sweat beginning to appear on the sides of his face. A feeling overwhelmed Mike, and it wasn't a bad feeling, which wasn't good considering he was being romantic with not only his employee but his teenage employee. Regardless of all that it was a pleasant feeling to say the least. He looked around the nicely organized restaurant until his gaze feel on Em, who was currently drinking back glasses of sake… \"Em?\" He said, attempting to catch her attention. Having worked, she looked up at him. \"Are you allowed to be drinking that? You're underage\" He asked concerned. Em smiled cheekily and waved her hand around as if to say 'no worries'. Suddenly, she stopped drinking and put her glass down. Em stood in her seat on her knees and lightly put her soft lips against the side of his ear. \"You're very attractive, MR. Connell\" She whispered, being over enthusiastic while saying 'Mr. Connell'. Mike shivered with temptation but wasn't really sure what to do in the situation. He tensed up and tried to believe evenly; with no avail. \"Thank you\" He responded, almost confidently. He took a shaky sip of the sake Em had put on the table. A feeling overwhelmed Mike, something he had not felt since he was married. \"You're 17 Em, and I'm as old as 30, there's something wrong with this attraction\" He said huskily. \"There's nothing wrong with it at all\" Em answered. \"Age doesn't matter\". She turns and smiles at him, but the temptation was too strong. Mike bends over a bit and their lips meet in sync. They move closer together and wrapped up in each other bodies. Mike was the first the pull away; hesitantly. \"I don't think this is a good idea…\" He whispered very quietly. It was clear he wanted it. Em grabbed on to the collar of his dress shirt and pulled him in to her once again, smashing her lips in to his. He immediately fell back in to the rhythm of the kiss. \"Let them watch…\" Em murmured between kisses; knowing he was thinking about the people from the park. No doubt everyone came here to eat. They forcefully pulled apart as their food arrived at the table. Em put a piece of colorful sushi in to Mike's mouth with delight. \"How is it?\" She asked, excited for his opinion on the raw fish. \"It's interesting… but Em, I don't think…\" He began, but was interrupted. \"Don't worry!\" When Em turned and smiled, it sent shivers of pleasure up Mike's spine and he was tempted to drop the subject. He looked her up and down and bit his lips and debate. All he thought about was how young she was… Mike sighed with defeat and placed his hand on her thigh. There was just something about this girl that made him feel free. She put light in to his desperate life. \"I think we should continue all this at your place after work\" Em informed him, winking to make it more tempting. Shock overtook Mike's face and he thought about how to respond to that. \"Sure\" He answered, forgetting what he was answering. He then sharply turned towards her. \"Wait what?\" He exclaimed. \"Your house. After work\" Em told him proudly. \"Are you sure this is the kind of step you want to take Em?\" He said, getting a little worried. \"Of course\" Em continued to devour her food as she spoke. \"Are you ready for that?\" He pushed. \"YES!\" Em exclaimed accompanied by a cute little giggle. As he was about to continue the conversation, the restaurant door dinged and he heard a very familiar annoying laugh. Mike turned his head just in time to see Cricket and Tommy walking towards them. \"Mr. Connell, How nice to see you here\" Cricket said loudly, trying to sound innocent. \"What are you doing here, you two, who is watching the amusement park?\" Mike asked them, sounding a little concerned but still firm. \"We sort of…\" Cricket started to say nervously. \"Sort of what cricket\" Mike demanded a little more stern. \"Closed it for a bit? There wasn't anyone there anyways\" Cricket tried to defend herself. She seemed to look over at Em a lot as if she were suspicious of her. \"Hello there\" Tommy said towards Em while winking. Cricket immediately hit him and yelled at him. While they were doing that, Mike dragged Em out of the restaurant, paying the counter as he went by. \"We should get back to the amusement park\" He instructed, a little out of breath. \"I didn't expect to see those guys there\" Em said out loud. \"Neither did I\" Mike answered while he wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her closer to him. He looked around to make sure they were completely out of view. Almost out of nowhere, it got really heated in the middle of the parking lot. The kissing became intense and hands were wandering everywhere on both bodies. \"Are you sure you want this?\" Mike asked, breathing heavily. \"Yes, I want it, now. Let's go\" Em insisted. \"Go where?\" Neither minds were thinking clearly at that point. \"To your house\" Em answered before smashing her lips in to his once again. \"We could get in a lot of trouble for this, Em\" Mike said, pulling away gently. \"I like a good risk and a bit of danger\" Em answering teasingly, pushing him against the car. \"Get in\" She demanded. Mike thought about a thousand arguments but couldn't agree with any of them. That being said, he got in to the car and gave Em detailed directions to get to his house. After walking through the front door, Em instinctively found the love seat couch and sat down. \"Well this is nice\" Em said looking around. \"Thanks…\" Mike muttered in response. \"Is it yours?\" she asked as she smiled sincerely towards her new boss. \"Yes…\" He responded hesitantly. \"You could say that\". \"Are you okay?\" Em asked, seeing the nervousness in Mike's eyes. \"I'm not sure about this, Em\" He said honestly. Em stood up and cupped his face in her soft hands. \"It's okay, I just want to make you happy, mike\" She told him sweetly. At those words Mike's whole body relaxed. \"I haven't heard that in a very long time…\" He told her, speaking quietly. Em wrapped her arms around him and he wrapped his around her, she lifted her lips to his ear and very lustfully said; \"You're such a strong man\". Mike took Em up in his arms and carried her down the hall, unable to restrain himself any longer. The bedroom wasn't too far away. However by the time they got there, they were both breathing heavily from anticipation and intense making out. Mike threw Em gently on the bed and came on after her. He enveloped her in his muscular arms and lost control.

But over the summer, as her affair with Conell became more aggressive, she was desperately seeking something other than the rough touch of a man. Girls were more polished, she decided. Soft. Gentle. There was no chance of them hurting her the way men were able to. There were things about girls she'd always noticed and liked. The silkiness of their hair and skin, their defined figures, the way they could look beautiful without trying... Okay, so maybe she was bisexual. But these were feelings. Did labels matter in the end? -x- It wasn't the first time she'd seen Lisa P., who was really just Lisa to Em, strutting around the park, flashing her smile at every boy in the vicinity and snapping her gum. But it was the first time Em had truly looked at her. Really seen her. Lisa's hair hung down her back in curls that somehow looked wild and tamed at the same time. Em was captivated by this, the way the light brunette locks caught the sunlight and seemingly held it for hours afterward. That pink Adventureland shirt was stretched too tight across Lisa's chest. Em could see her nipples outlined through it. As much as she hated to admit it, she liked it. Just a little. She was thinking about this realization, almost annoyed that it had hit her out of the blue, when Lisa caught her eye and sauntered over, too-short shorts exposing the majority of her legs. Suddenly shy, Em purposely brushed her hair towards her eyes and offered a tentative smile. Up close, she could see that Lisa's lipstick was smudged. \"Hey.\" Em held her hand in the air by way of a greeting. Lisa returned the gesture, snapping her gum loudly again and staring at Em, eyes wide and sultry. Em stared right back. She couldn't help herself. Lisa reached out and brushed a strand of hair away from Em's cheek. Leaning forward, she whispered, \"meet me in the arcade after your shift is over.\" Em watched her walk away. What the fuck was she doing? It was too late to wonder. -x- The small of Em's back was pressed against the pinball machine. She wasn't focused on the discomfort. Inside the arcade, it was dark and hot. Lisa stood toe to toe with Em, finally rid of the stupid gum, and moistened her lips. \"Well.\" Em swallowed, already growing aroused. \"Well, what?\" Lisa giggled. \"I'm sorry, but this is so new...I've never done this with a girl before.\" \"Neither have I,\" Em admitted, staring bashfully at the sticky tile floor. Lisa took Em's hands. \"It's okay.\" Her voice had gotten huskier. \"We can experiment.\" Em was the one to initiate the first kiss they shared. She barely had to stretch to be able to wrap her arms around Lisa's neck and let their lips softly touch. She noticed that Lisa tasted like strawberry lip gloss and smelled like vanilla. Or cake. Her underwear were growing damp. Lisa's fingers curled almost roughly in Em's hair, pulling her even closer. As the pressure of their mouths touching intensified, Em forgot how to breathe. But when Lisa slid a hand past the edge of her jeans, into those wet underpants and toward her most private place, she lost the ability completely. This experiment was better than the touch of any man. ","Summary":" Em knew she wasn't gay.

LEVEL I Tata bahasa Korea Pelajaran Bahasa Korea ke-1 안녕하세요. = Halo. / Hey. / Apa kabar? / Selamat pagi. / Selamat Malam. /dsb… 안녕+하세요 = 안녕하세요. [an-nyeong] [ha-se-yo] 안녕 = kesejahteraan, perdamaian, kesehatan 하세요 = anda buat, apakah anda?, tolong lakukan 안녕하세요 adalah cara paling umum sambutan seseorang dalam Korea, dan 안녕하세요 adalah dalam 존댓말 [jondaetmal], sopan / bahasa formal. Ketika seseorang menyapa anda dengan 안녕하세요, anda dapat menjawab orang tersebut kembali dengan 안녕하세요. Contoh Percakapan: A: 안녕하세요. [annyeong-haseyo] = Halo B: 안녕하세요. [annyeong-haseyo] = halo juga C. 감사합니다. = Terima Kasih 감사 + 합니다 = 감사합니다. [gam-sa] [hap-ni-da] 감사 = penghargaan, rasa syukur, terima kasih dan 합니다 = Saya lakukan, saya melakukan 감사합니다 adalah cara formal (존댓말) paling umum digunakan untuk mengucapkan ―Terima Kasih.‖ 감사 berarti ―terimakasih‖ dan 합니다 berarti ―Saya Lakukan.. Pelajaran ke-2 네 / 아니요 Dalam Bahasa Korea, ―Ya‖ adalah 네 [ne] dan ―Tidak‖ adalah 아니요 [aniyo] dalam bentuk 존댓말 [jondaetmal], bahasa sopan. 네. [Ne] = Ya. 아니요. [aniyo] = tidak Tetapi di Korea, disaat orang-orang mengatakan ―네 ini tidak sama halnya mengatakan ―Ya,‖ dalam bahasa Indonesia. begitu juga dengan ―아니요. Karena dalam bahasa Korea ―네 mengekspresikan anda Setuju dengan yang dikatakan orang lain. Dan ―아니요‖ mengekspresikan anda ada perbedaan pendapat atau penyangkalan dengan perkataan orang lain. Misalnya, seseorang bertanya: Anda tidak suka kopi?‖ (커피 안 좋아해요? [keo-pi jo-a-hae-yo?] (pada bahasa Korea) dan jika jawaban anda adalah : Tidak, aku tidak suka kopi . Anda harus mengatakan 네.‖ Contoh Dalam Percakapan : Q : 커피 좋아해요? [keo-pi jo-a-hae-yo?] = Apakah kamu suka kopi? A : 네. 좋아해요. [ne. jo-a-hae-yo] = Ya saya suka kopi. Q : 커피 좋아해요?

[ne. an jo-a-hae-yo] = ya, saya tidak suka kopi. 네 [ne] dapat juga di gunakan untuk mengatakan, ya betul/ Benar kah. / saya tau. / saya disini! (ketika seseorang bertanya) / saya mengerti. / Ah-ha. / dll… 맞아요 Orang Korea sering menempatkan 맞아요 [ma-ja-yo] setelah 네 [ne]. 네, 맞아요. [ne, ma-ja-yo] = ya, itu betul. Pelajaran ke-3 Melanjutkan pelajaran ke-1 : 안녕하세요. [an-nyeong ha se yo] di dalam bahasa Korea, ketika anda mengatakan Selamat tinggal‖ secara formal / Korea sopan 존댓말 [jondaetmal], ada dua jenis ekspresi yang biasa di gunakan yaitu : 1. selamat tinggal di gunakan apabila orang lain tinggal dan kita pergi kita dapat mengatakan: 안녕히 계세요. [an-nyeong-hi -gye-se-yo ][selamat tinggal] 2. selamat Jalan di gunakan apabila orang lain pergi dan kita tinggal kita dapat mengatakan : 안녕히 가세요. [an-nyeong-hi-ga-se-yo] [selamat jalan] Pelajaran ke-4 죄송 합니다. [Joe-song-hap-ni-da] 죄송 합니다 = 죄송 ditambah 합니다. 죄 송 [joe-song] berarti maaf, mohon maaf atau perasaan malu dan 합니다 [hap-ni-da] berarti melakukan sehingga 죄송 합니다 [joe-song-hap-ni-da] berarti : Saya minta maaf‖. 죄송 합니다 tidak selalu berarti \"Maaf\". Meskipun 죄송 합니다 [joe-song-hap-ni-da] adalah Pada dasarnya Maaf. Anda tidak dapat menggunakan 죄송 합니다 ketika Anda ingin mengatakan Saya menyesal mendengar itu. Hal ini karena 죄송 합니다 adalah hanya berarti Aku minta maaf. Itu buruk. Maaf kan. Atau, saya seharusnya tidak melakukan itu. Tidak pernah bisa berarti aku menyesal mendengar itu. Dalam bahasa Indonesia, Anda dapat menggunakan istilah \"Permisi.\" Dalam semua situasi berikut: 1) Ketika Anda melewati kerumunan orang. 2) Ketika Anda meninggalkan ruangan sejenak. 3) Ketika Anda ingin menarik perhatian seseorang dan berbicara dengan mereka atau membiarkan mereka tahu sesuatu. 4) Bila Anda ingin untuk memanggil pelayan di restoran atau kafe untuk memesan sesuatu. Di dalam bahasa korea 저 기요 [jeo-gi-yo] adalah sebuah ekspresi yang dapat diterjemahkan sebagai ungkapan untuk mengatakan \"Permisi tetapi 저기요 HANYA digunakan untuk nomor situasi 3 dan 4 di atas. Bagaimana mengatakan Permisi. Bila Anda ingin melewati kerumunan orang? Anda dapat mengatakan: 잠시 만요. [cam-si-man-yo] (arti harfiah: ―Sebentar.‖)[sebentar saya mau lewat] 죄송 합니다. [Joe-song-ham-ni-da] (arti harfiah: ―Saya menyesal.‖)[maaf saya mau lewat] 잠깐 만요. [cam-kkan-man-yo] (arti harfiah: ―Sebentar.‖)[permisi sebentar mau lewat] Pelajaran ke-5 이에요 / 예요 [i-e-yo / ye-yo] 이에요 dan 예요 = adalah Contoh : 이거 ABC 예요. [I-geo ABC-ye-yo] = Ini adalah ABC. Untuk menentukan apakah akan menggunakan 이에요 [i-e-yo] atau 예요 [ye- yo] tergantung pada apakah huruf terakhir pada kata sebelumnya berakhir dengan konsonan atau vokal. 이 에요 dan 예요 Bila ingin mengatakan bahwa ABC adalah DEF dalam bahasa Korea, jika kata‖DEF‖ memiliki konsonan pada kata terakhir, maka tambahkan 이에요 [i-e-yo], tetapi jika tidak memiliki konsonan akhir dan berakhir dengan vokal, tambahkan 예요 [ye-yo]. Hal tersebut untuk membuat pengucapan yang mudah, sehingga akan terucap secara alami jika Anda berlatih dengan beberapa kalimat yang mudah. Konsonan akhir + 이에요 [i-e-yo] Tidak ada konsonan akhir (hanya vokal ) + 예요 [ye-yo] Contoh kalimat 물이 에요. = + 물 이에요 [mul + i-e-yo] (Ini) adalah air. 가방 이에요. = 가방 이에요 [ga-bang + i-e-yo] (Ini)adalah tas. 사무실 이에요. = 사무실 이에요 [sa-mu-sil + i-e-yo] (Ini) adalah kantor. 학교 예요. = 학교 예요 [hak-gyo + ye-yo] (Ini) adalah sekolah. 저예요. = 저 예요 [jeo + ye-yo] (Ini) saya. Anda juga dapat membuat pertanyaan 이에요 dan 예요 ini hanya dengan menaikkan nada di akhir kalimat. 물이 에요. [Mul-i-e-yo] = ini adalah air. 물이 에요? [Mul-i-e-yo?] = Apakah itu air? 학교 예요. [Hak-gyo-ye-yo] = Ini sekolah. 학교 예요? [Hak-yo-ye-yo] = Apakah itu sekolah? Apakah Anda di sekolah sekarang? 뭐 [MWO] = apa 뭐예요? [MWO-ye-yo?] = Apa itu? Pelajaran ke-6 이거 [i-geo] = ini, yang ini 이에요 / 예요 [i-e-yo / ye-yo] Dalam pelajaran sebelumnya, anda belajar bagaimana 이에요 [i-e-yo] dan 예요 [ye- yo] dapat ditaruh setelah kata benda yang berarti Ini adalah ABC atau saya adalah DEF.‖ Lihat Contoh berikut : 책 [chaek] + 이에요 [i-e-yo] = 책이에요. [chaek-i-e-yo] = Ini sebuah buku. 저 [jeo] + 예요 [ye- yo] = 저예요. [jeo-ye-yo] =Ini saya. ada konsonan akhir+ 이에요 [i-e-yo] Tidak ada konsonan di akhir (berakhitan vokal) + 예요 [ye- yo] 이거 [i-geo] = ini, yang ini 이 [i] (―ini‖) + 것 [geot] (―hal‖) = 이것 [i-geot] – 이거 [i-geo] 이거 [i-geo] semula 이것 [i-geot] ditambah 이 [i] (―ini‖) dan 것 [geot] (―hal‖) tetapi sering digunakan 이거 [i-geo] untuk kemudahan pengucapan.

[mwo-ye-yo?] dan ini berarti apakah itu?‖ Anda dapat menambah 이거 [i-geo] di depan untuk bertanya apakah ini? Q : 이거 뭐예요? [i-geo mwo-ye-yo?] = Apakah ini? A : 이거 핸드폰이에요. [i-geo haen-deu-pon-i-e-yo] = Ini adalah ponsel. Q : 이거 뭐예요? [i-geo mwo-ye-yo?] = Apa ini? A : 이거 물이에요. [i-geo mul-i-e-yo] = Ini adalah air. Pelajaran ke-7 이, 그, dan 저 Dalam pelajaran ini, Kita dapat mempelajari bagaimana untuk mengatakan ini, itu, dan yang disana‖ dalam bahasa Korea. Dalam bahasa Indonesia, kata-kata ini, itu, disana dapat dipergunakanberfariasi dengan memodifikasi kata-kata. Contoh : Dalam bahasa Indonesia anda dapat mengatakan Ini adalah mobil saya dan juga Mobil ini milik saya . Jadi kata ini di sini dapat dipergunakan sebagai kata ganti dan juga sebagai keterangan tentang si pemilik mobil. Dalam bahasa Korea, untuk mengatakan ini, itu, disana 이 [i] = ini (dekat kamu) 그 [geu] = / itu (dekat orang lain) 저 [jeo] = yang (di sana) jauh dari keduanya 이 [i] ketika sesuatu dekat dekat dengan anda, anda dapat menggunakan 이 [i]. 그 [geu] , ketika sesuatu lebih jauh jauh dari anda dan lebih dekat dengan orang lain gunakan 그 [geu]. 저 [ jeo] ketika sesuatu jauh sekali dari anda dan lawan bicara, gunakan 저 kabar [ jeo]. disana, 저 ini memiliki pengucapan yang sama dengan kata : 저 = saya‖ (bahasa Korea formal) tetapi anda dapat membedakannya tergantung kontek kalimatnya Untuk 이, 그, dan 저 dalam bahasa Korea hanya dapat bekerja sebagai kata penunjuk ketika anda ingin mengatakan \"ini\" \"yang\" atau \"ia\" sebagai kata ganti, anda harus menambah 거 [geo] atau 것 [geot] setelah kata benda 거 [geo] = 것 [geot] = hal, barang, barang, di gabungkan dengan 이 [i] = ini 이 + 것 = 이것 [i-geot] atau 이거 [i-geo] = ini, barang ini, yang ini 그 [geu] = itu 그 + 것 = 그것 [geu-geot] atau 그거 [geu-geo] =itu, benda itu, yang itu, 저 [jeo] = disana, 저 + 것 = 저것 [geu-geot] atau 저거 [geu-geo] = yang di sana, benda yang di sana Anda dapat membentuk bermacam-macam ekspresi 이, 그, atau 저 bersama dengan kata lain.

Dimanapun anda ingin mengatakan bahwa sesuatu adalah bukan sesuatu, anda dapat mengatakan suatu subjek dan 아니에요 [a ni e yo]. Kata benda + 아니에요 = Menjadi bukan + kata benda Contoh : 저 아니에요. [jeo a ni e yo] = Ini bukan saya. 우유 아니에요. [u-yu a ni e yo] = Ini bukan susu. 물 아니에요. [mul a ni e yo] = Ini bukan air. Jika anda ingin mengatakan Ini bukan susu. Saya bukan seorang siswa . Itu bukan taman dan lain-lain, anda dapat menambahkannya pada awal kalimat susu = 우유 [u-yu] bukan susu = 우유 아니에요. [u-yu a ni e yo] Ini bukan susu. = 이거 우유 아니에요. [i-geo u-yu a ni e yo] Siswa = 학생 [hak-saeng] bukan seorang siswa = 학생 아니에요 [hak-saeng a ni e yo] Saya bukan seorang siswa. = 저 학생 아니에요.

Kata berakhiran consonant + -은 Kata berakhiran vokal + -는 Contoh : 가방 [ga-bang] + 은 [eun] 나 [na] + 는 [neun] Topik pembicaraan di tandai dengan 은 [eun] atau 는 [neun] biasanya (tetapi tidak selalu) contoh : 저 [jeo] = saya 저 + 는 [neun] = 저는 [jeo-neun] = Topik pembicaraan adalah saya 저는 학생이에요. [jeo-neun hak-saeng-i-e-yo] = Saya adalah seorang pelajar saya sebagai subjek. Terkadang bahasa Korea unik, lihat contoh berikut. 내일은 저는 일해요[nae-il-eun jeo-neun il-hae-yo] = sebagai pembicaraan‖besok‖, saya bekerja.‖ disini, 내일 [nae-il], besok, di ikuti dengan 은 [eun], sebagai topik kalimat, tetapi bukan sebagai subjek dari 일하다 [il-ha-da], bekerja‖ karena, besok, yang bekerja tetapi, saya‖ yang bekerja. Partikel Subjek 이 [i] / 가 [ga] Subjek partikel lebih simple di banding topik partikel : Kata berakhiran consonant + -이 Kata berakhiran Vokal + -가 Contoh : 가방 [ga-bang] + 이 [i] 학교 [hak-gyo] + 가 [ga] Pada dasarnya, topic partikel (은/는) mencerminkan topik dari sebuah kalimat, dan Partikel subjek (이/가) menunjukan subjek dari kalimat Mengenai partikel 은/는/이/가? (1) Selain menandakan suatu kalimat sebagai topik, 은 [eun] / 는 [neun] memberikan pengertian tentang sesuatu dan untuk membedakan dari hal lain dalam kalimat (2) Selain untuk subyek pada kalimat, 이 [i] / 가 [ga] memiliki pengertian tidak lain dan juga, bila digunakan dalam kalimat yang kompleks, ber peran menandai subjek contoh dari no (1). 이거 [i-geo] = ini / 사과 [sa-gwa] = apel / 예요 [ye-yo] = adalah 이거 사과예요. [i-geo sa-gwa-ye-yo] = ini adalah apel. Dapat menambahkan 은/는 pada kalimat ini, dan subjek dari kalimat ini adalah, 이거, karena berakhiran vokal maka tambahkan -는. 이거는 사과예요. [i-geo-NEUN sa-gwa-ye-yo] = (yang lain bukan apel, tetapi) ini adalah apel. Contoh seseorang bicara seperti ini : 이거 커피예요. [i-geo keo-pi-ye-yo] (= ini adalah kopi) 이거는 물이에요. [i-geo-NEUN mul-i-e-yo] (= itu adalah kopi, tetapi yang ini adalah air.) 이거는 오렌지주스예요. [i-geo-NEUN o-ren-ji-ju-seu-ye-yo] (= dan yang ini, adalah beda, ini adalah jus jeruk.) 이거는 뭐예요? [i-geo-NEUN mwo-ye-yo?] (= dan apakah yang ini? Apa ini?) Contoh penggunaan dalam kalimat: 1) 오늘 날씨 좋네요. [o-neul nal-ssi jot-ne-yo] Hari ini cuacanya bagus. 2) 오늘은 날씨 좋네요. [o-neul-EUN nal-ssi jot-ne-yo] (sebelumnya cuaca tidak bagus, tetapi hari ini bagus.) 3) 오늘 날씨는 좋네요. [o-neul nal-ssi-NEUN jot-ne-yo] (Hari ini, ―belum tentu yang lain‖ tetapi untuk cuaca adalah bagus.) Oleh karena itu partikel (은/는) dapat memberikan nuansa lain dalam percakapan bahasa korea! Contoh untuk no (2) . 좋아요 [jo-a-yo] = ini bagus / 뭐 [mwo] = apa / 이/가 [i/ga] = subject partikel Apa bila ingin mengatakan 좋아요. [jo-a-yo]‖ berarti ini adalah bagus atau saya suka ini Tetapi apabila tidak yakin apa yang bagus Apa yang bagus? atau maksudnya apa? Untuk mengepresikan apakah yang bagus dapat mengatakan: 뭐가 좋아요? [mwo-GA jo-a-yo?] Kata 가 [ga] melambangkan subjek dari kata kerja 좋아요 adalah, jika seseorang mengatakan, ABC 좋아요. [ABC jo-a-yo] = ABC adalah bagus. Dan jika anda tidak setuju XYZ adalah bagus, ber pendapat yang bagus seharusnya XYZ bukan ABC, dengan mengatakan: ABC 좋아요? XYZ가 좋아요! [ABC jo-a-yo? XYZ-GA jo-a-yo] Untuk itu dengan 이 and 가, Anda dapat menambahkan rasa lebih dan makna lebih konkrit ketika Anda ingin menekankan Siapa melakukan sesuatu, YANG SATU yang baik, dan lain-lain. PELAJARAN KE-10 있어요[i-sseo-yo] dan 없어요[EOP-sseo-yo] Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan melihat pada ekspresi‖있어요[i-sseo-yo] dan 없어요[EOP-sseo-yo] Bila Anda ingin berbicara tentang apa yang orang TELAH, dan juga tentang hal-hal yang ADA/Tidak Ada, Anda dapat menggunakan kalimat tersebut. 있어요 [i-sseo-yo] berasal dari 있다 [it-da], dan pada dasarnya menyatakan bahwa sesuatu itu ada. Contoh penggunaan 있어요 - 없어요[I-sseo-yo] [EOP-sseo-yo 있어요 [i-sseo-yo] 물 [mul] = air 친구 [chin-gu] = teman 시간 [si-gan] = waktu Anda cukup menambahkan 있어요 pada akhir kata benda yang Anda maksud. 1. 물 있어요. [mul i-sseo-yo] = Ada air. / Air ada. / Saya memiliki air. / Mereka memiliki air. 2. 물 있어요? [muli- sseo-yo?] = Apakah ada air? / Apakah Anda memiliki air? / Apakah mereka memiliki air? 3. 친구 있어요. [Chin-gu i-sseo-yo] = Aku punya teman. / Aku punya teman. / Ada teman-teman. 4. 친구 있어요? [Chin-gu i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah Anda memiliki teman? / Apakah mereka memiliki teman-teman? 5. 시간 있어요. [Si-gan i-sseo-yo] = Ada waktu. / Aku punya waktu. / Mereka punya waktu. 6. 시간 있어요? [Si-gan i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah ada waktu? / Apakah Anda memiliki waktu? / Apakah mereka punya waktu? Dan hanya dengan mengganti 있어요 [i-sseo-yo] dengan 없어요 [eops-eo-yo] kalimat mempunyai arti yang berlawanan. 없어요 [EOP-sseo-yo] 1. 시간 없어요. [Si-gan EOP-sseo-yo] = Tidak ada waktu. / Aku tidak punya waktu. / Kita tidak punya waktu. 2. 친구 없어요. [Chin-gu EOP-sseo-yo] = saya tidak punya teman. Apakah Anda ingat penggunaan dari Partikel 은 / 는 [eun / Neun], 이 / 가 [i / ga], 은 dan 는 jika Anda mengatakan 시간 없어요. [Si-gan eops-eo-yo] yang berarti saya tidak punya waktu. Dan jika Anda ingin mengatakan, Aku memiliki hal-hal lain tetapi hanya WAKTU yang tidak saya miliki. Anda dapat mengatakan bahwa hanya dengan menambahkan 은 [eun] atau 는 [Neun] pada akhir 시간 [si-gan] (namun dalam kasus ini, kata 시간 berakhir dengan konsonan sehingga 은 digunakan), menjadi 시간 은 없어요. 있어요 dan 없어요 dapat digunakan untuk membentuk ekspresi yang menarik dan sering digunakan banyak orang di di Korea dengan menggabungkan 2 kata berikut 재미 [Jae-mi] = menyenangkan 재미 + 있어요 = 재미 있어요 secara harfiah berarti menyenangkan akan tetapi juga berarti menarik Contoh penggunaan ; TTMIK 재미 있어요! [Jae-mi-i-sseo-yo] = TTMIK sangat menyenangkan! / TTMIK menarik. Bahasa Korea L.I(11-20) PELAJARAN 11 있어요. [I-sseo-yo] \"Aku memiliki …\" \"Ada …\" 없어요. [EOP-seo-yo] \"Saya tidak punya …\" \"Tidak ada …\" Contoh 사과 [sa-GWA] = apel 사과 있어요 [sa-GWA i-sseo-yo] = Saya memiliki apel, Ada apel, Mereka memiliki beberapa apel. 사과 없어요 [sa-GWA EOP-seo-yo] = saya tidak punya apel, Tidak ada apel 오렌지 [O-ren-ji] = Jeruk 오렌지 있어요 [O-ren-ji i-sseo-yo] = saya punya jeruk, Ada jeruk. 오렌지 없어요 [O-ren-ji EOP-seo-yo] = Saya tidak punya jeruk, Tidak ada jeruk. Sekarang, jika Anda ingin bertanya apakah seseorang memiliki sesuatu atau tidak atau apakah tidak memiliki sesuatu? Cukup dengan menaikkan nada di akhir kalimat, Anda dapat membuatnya pertanyaan. 있어요? [I-sseo-yo] = Apakah Anda memiliki …? Apakah ada …? 없어요? [EOP-seo-yo] = Apa Anda tidak punya …? Tidak ada …? Contoh 사과 있어요 [sa-GWA i-sseo-yo] = Saya memiliki apel, Ada beberapa apel. 사과 있어요? [Sa-GWA i-sseo-yo] = Apakah Anda memiliki sebuah apel? Apakah Anda memiliki apel? 사과 없어요? [Sa-GWA i-sseo-yo] = Anda tidak memiliki apel apapun? Tidak ada apel? Mari kita mengambil beberapa kata benda lain misalnya. 시간 [si-gan] = waktu 시간 있어요? [Si-gan i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah Anda memiliki beberapa waktu? 시간 없어요? [Si-gan EOP-seo-yo?] = Anda tidak punya waktu? 커피 [Keo-pi] = kopi 커피 있어요? [Keo-pi i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah Anda memiliki kopi? 커피 없어요? [Keo-pi EOP-seo-yo?] = Apakah tidak ada kopi? Anda tidak memiliki kopi? Sekarang, setelah mencari apakah seseorang memiliki sesuatu atau tidak, Anda mungkin juga ingin meminta sesuatu, dengan mengatakan Tolong beri saya … atau Saya ingin sesuatu … tolonglah . 주세요 [ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya 주 세요 [ju-se-yo] berasal dari kata kerja 주다 [ju-da] yang berarti untuk memberikan sehingga secara harfiah 주세요 adalah berarti Tolong beri saya dalam bahasa sopan/resmi terlepas dari siapa atau oleh siapa. Contoh J: 사과 있어요? [Sa-GWA i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah anda punya apel? B: 네. 사과 있어요. [Ne. sa-GWA i-sseo-yo] = Ya, kami memiliki apel. J: 사과 주세요. [Sa-GWA ju-se-yo.] = Berikan saya (sebuah / beberapa) apel. * Harap diperhatikan bahwa tidak ada peraturan mengikat antara jamak dan tunggal dalam kata benda Korea. J: 커피 있어요? [Keo-pi i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah Anda memiliki kopi? B: 아니요. 커피 없어요. [An-i-yo. Keo-pi EOP-seo-yo] = Tidak, kami tidak punya kopi. J: 우유 있어요? [U-yu i-sseo-yo?] = Apakah Anda memiliki susu? B: 네. 우유 있어요. [Ne. u-yu i-sseo-yo] =. Ya, kami memiliki susu. J: 우유 주세요. [U-yu ju-se-yo.] = Tolong Berikan saya susu. 주 세요 [ju-se-yo] dapat digunakan dalam berbagai situasi: Ketika Anda meminta seseorang untuk menyerahkan sesuatu kepada Anda, ketika Anda memesan sesuatu di restoran, ketika minta item di toko, atau, bila terpasang untuk kata kerja (yang kita akan belajar bagaimana melakukan di pelajaran selanjutnya), untuk meminta seseorang melakukan sesuatu untuk Anda. Contoh lainnya : 아이스크림 주세요 [ai-Seu-keu-rim ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya beberapa es krim. 햄버거 주세요 [heme-beo-geo ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya hamburger. 김치 주세요 [Gim-chi ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya beberapa kimchi. 불고기 주세요 [bul-go-gi ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya beberapa bulgogi. 밥 주세요 [bap ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya nasi/ Tolong beri saya makan. PELAJARAN 12 Dalam pelajaran sebelumnya, kita belajar bagaimana mengatakan Tolong beri saya… atau Saya ingin memiliki … silakan dalam bahasa Korea. Apakah Anda ingat ungkapan 주세요 [ju-se-yo] = Tolong beri saya … /Aku ingin memiliki… Dan Anda dapat menggunakan ekspresi ini (주세요) untuk memesan sesuatu di restoran atau untuk meminta lauk lebih saat Anda makan. 김밥 주세요. [Gim-bap ju-se-yo] = beri saya kimbap, (Ketika memesan di restoran) 불고기 주세요. [Bul-go-gi ju-se-yo] = beri saya Bulgogi, (Ketika memesan di restoran) 김치 주세요. [Gim-chi ju-se-yo] = Mohon diberikan kimchi untuk saya. Dalam pelajaran ini, mari kita lihat bagaimana untuk mengatakan Rasanya baik, Sangat lezat dan juga bagaimana harus berterima kasih untuk makan atau makanan sebelum dan setelah makan. 맛 [mat] berarti rasacdalam bahasa Korea. Sekarang, apakah Anda ingat bagaimana mengatakan ada atau Saya harus ? Ya! 있어요 [i-sseo-yo] adalah ekspresi. Jadi dengan meletakkan 맛 dan 있어요 bersama-sama, Anda mendapatkan suatu ungkapan yaitu 맛있 어요 [ma-si-sseo-yo] yang berarti Ini lezat. 맛있 어요 [ma-si-sseo-yo] = Ini lezat. Ini lezat. Contoh 이거 맛있 어요. [I-geo ma-si-sseo-yo] = Ini adalah lezat. 저 케익 맛있 어요. [Jeo Ke-ik ma-si-sseo-yo] = kue Itu lezat. 삼겹살 맛있 어요. [Sam-gyeop-sal ma-si-sseo-yo] = Samgyupsal (Korea barbekyu) adalah lezat. 뭐가 맛있 어요? [MWO-ga ma-si-sseo-yo?] = Apa yang enak? Sekarang, apakah Anda juga ingat bagaimana mengatakan tidak ada atau Saya tidak memiliki dalam bahasa Korea? Ya, 없어요 [EOP-seo-yo]. Apabila di gabungkan dengan 맛 dan 없어요 bersama-sama, Anda mendapatkan ekspresi 맛없어요 [mad-eop-seo-yo], yang berarti Tidak enak rasanya. 맛없어요 [mad-EOP-seo-yo] = Ini tidak lezat. Ini tidak enak. Rasanya mengerikan. Perhatikan bahwa pengucapan huruf terakhir di 맛, yaitu ㅅ, Ketika TIDAK diikuti dengan kata apapun, itu diucapkan sebagai [t], tetapi Ketika diikuti oleh 있어요, [s]suara, 맛있 어요 di ucapkan sebagai [ma-si-sseo-yo]. Ketika diikuti oleh 없어요, menjadi [D] suara, membuat 맛없어요 diucapkan sebagai [ma-deop-seo-yo]. Contoh 이거 맛없어요? [I-geo ma-deop-seo-yo?] = Apakah ini rasanya tidak enak? 이 차 맛없어요. [I cha ma-deop-seo-yo] = Teh ini rasanya tidak enak. Sekarang, Anda tahu bagaimana mengatakan Ini enak dan Ini tidak enak.‖ Sudah waktunya untuk belajar frase yang Anda bisa mengatakan terima kasih untuk makan sebelum dan setelah Anda makan. Hal ini sangat penting terutama jika seseorang memperlakukan Anda atau jika Anda diundang ke rumah seseorang. 잘 먹겠 습니다. [Jal meok-ge-sseum-ni-da] 잘 먹겠 습니다 [jal meok-ge-sseum-ni-da] secara harafiah berarti saya akan makan dengan baik . Atau Saya akan makan makanannya dengan baik . ungkapan ini sangat sering digunakan di antara warga Korea ketika mereka akan mulai makan makanan, biasanya terlepas siapa yang membayar untuk makan. Tapi dalam kasus seseorang khususnya adalah mentraktir makanan untuk yang lain, orang yang di traktir akan mengatakan 잘 먹겠 습니다 kepada orang yang sudah membelikan makanan. Ketika Anda ingin bercanda bahwa teman Anda harus membeli makanan untuk Anda, Anda juga dapat mengatakan 잘 먹을게! [Jal MEO-Geul-ge!] Yang berarti bahwa Anda berterima kasih kepada mereka karena mereka akan mentraktir Anda. 잘 먹었습니다. [Jal MEO-geo-sseum-ni-da] Setelah Anda selesai makan, jika Anda ingin berterima kasih kepada seseorang untuk makan, Anda dapat menggunakan ekspresi ini. 잘 먹었습니다 harfiah berarti Aku sudah makan dengan baik‖ berarti Terima kasih atas makanannya.‖ PELAJARAN 13 Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan mempelajari bagaimana untuk mengatakan Aku ingin… dalam bahasa Korea. Dalam pelajaran sebelumnya, kita belajar bagaimana mengatakan bahwa ada sesuatu yang lezat, dan juga bagaimana berterima kasih untuk makanan yang akan Anda makan. 맛있 어요. [Ma-si-sseo-yo] = Ini lezat. 잘 먹겠 습니다. [Jal meok-ge-sseum-ni-da] = Terima kasih atas makanan. Aku akan menikmatinya. Tapi sebelum Anda memesan sesuatu di restoran atau di warung kopi, Anda mungkin juga bertanya teman Anda apa yang ingin mereka makan, dan juga memberitahu mereka apa yang Anda ingin makan. Dalam bahasa Indonesia, Anda menambahkan istilah ingin sebelum kata kerja, tapi di Korea, anda perlu mengubah akhir kata kerja. – 고 싶어요 [-Go sip-eo-yo] = Saya ingin … Berikut adalah beberapa kata kerja Korea yang sering digunakan. 가다 [ga-da] = pergi 보다 [bo-da] = melihat 먹다 [meok-da] = makan Dan mengubah kata kerja ini ke dalam bentuk 고 싶어요 sangat sederhana. Hanya menghilangkan 다 [da] (huruf terakhir dalam semua kata kerja Korea) dan menambahkan – 고 싶어요 [go sipeoyo]. Pergi = 가다 [ga-da] — 가 + 고 싶어요 가고 싶어요 [ga-go si-po-yo] Saya ingin pergi. Melihat = 보다 [bo-da] — 보 + 고 싶어요 보고 싶어요 [bo-go si-po-yo] Saya ingin melihat / menonton. Makan = 먹다 [meok-da] — 먹 + 고 싶어요 먹고 싶어요 [meok-go si-po-yo] Saya ingin makan. Contoh percakapan J: 뭐 먹고 싶어요?

Berikut adalah kata penting untuk diketahui. 더 [deo] = lebih Sekarang Anda tahu bagaimana mengatakan Saya ingin makan (itu) Anda bisa mengatakan saya ingin makan lebih banyak.‖ Menggunakan kata ini (더). 먹고 싶어요. [Meok-go si-po-yo] = Saya ingin makan. 더 먹고 싶어요. [Deo meok-go si-po-yo] = Saya ingin makan lebih banyak. PELAJARAN 14 Dalam pelajaran kita sebelumnya, kami belajar bagaimana untuk mengatakan Ingin dalam bahasa Korea. Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan berlatih menggunakan struktur Ingin dalam contoh pemakaian dalam percakapan menggunakan kata kerja sbb: 하다 [ha-da] = melakukan 보다 [bo-da] = melihat 먹다 [meok-da] = makan 사다 [sa-da] = membeli 마시다 [ma-si-da] = minum 다 [da] di hilangkan dan tambahkan 고 싶어요 [go si-po-yo] setelah kata kerja. 하다 - 하고 싶어요 [ha-go si-po-yo] = sayai ngin mengerjakan … 보다 - 보고 싶어요 [bo-go si-po-yo] = saya ingin melihat … 먹다 - 먹고 싶어요 [meok-go si-po-yo] = Saya ingin makan … 사다 - 사고 싶어요 [sa-go si-po-yo] = Saya ingin membeli … 마 시다 - 마시고 싶어요 [ma-si-go-si-po-yo] = Saya ingin minum … Apakah Anda ingat bagaimana mengatakan APA‖dalam bahasa Korea? 뭐 [MWO] = apa Contoh percakapan: *Ingat: Dalam bahasa Korea, objek datang sebelum kata kerja.* J: 뭐 하고 싶어요?

PELAJARAN 15 Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan berbicara tentang ANGKA!. Sino-Korea Kami akan menggunakan istilah ―sino-Korea‖ yaitu angka Korea berdasarkan bahasa Cina. Yaitu: 1 일 [il] 2 이 [i] 3 삼 [sam] 4 사 [sa] 5 오 [o] 6 륙 [Ryuk] atau 육 [yuk] 7 칠 [chil] 8 팔 [fal] 9 구 [gu] 10 십 [sip] Dan sisanya adalah mudah. Dalam bahasa Korea, jika Anda ingin mengatakan 11, Anda hanya mengatakan SEPULUH + satu. Jika Anda ingin mengatakan 33, Anda hanya mengatakan TIGA + SEPULUH +TIGA. Jika Anda ingin mengatakan 99, Anda mengatakan SEMBILAN + SEPULUH + SEMBILAN. 100 백 [baek] 1.000 천 [cheon] Dapatkah Anda menebak bagaimana mengatakan 312 dalam sino Korea? Ya, Anda benar. TIGA+ RATUS + SEPULUH +DUA 삼 + 백 십 + 이 [Sam-baek-sip-i] Contoh-contoh 1.234 = 1.000 (천) + 2 (이) + 100 (백) + 3 (삼) + 10 (십) + 4 (사) 512 = 5 (오) + 100 (백) + 10 (십) + 2 (이) Perhatikan bahwa untuk 1.000, 100, dan 10, Anda tidak harus mengatakan satu (일) + ribu (천), 일백, atau 일십. PELAJARAN 16 Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan belajar cara pemakaian/modifikasi kata kerja dalam bahasa Korea. Ketika Anda mencari kata kerja dalam kamus Korea, ada dalam bentuk ini: 가다 [ga-da] = pergi 먹다 [meok-da] = makan 자다 [ja-da] = tidur 때리다 [ttae-ri-da] = untuk memukul 웃다 [ut-da] = tertawa/tersenyum Dan ketika Anda mengubah bentuk dari kata kerja untuk menyatakan waktu sekarang, konteks masa depan, bentuk lampau, dan lain-lain, hal pertama yang perlu Anda lakukan adalah menghilangkan kata terakhir, 다 [da], dan kemudian Anda memiliki kata dasar. Kata kerja dasar dari kata kerja di atas: 가 [ga] 먹 [meok] 자 [ja] 때리 [ttae-ri] 웃 [ut] Dan untuk ini, Anda menambahkan akhiran kata kerja yang tepat untuk membuat kalimat Dan dalam pelajaran ini kita akan belajar bagaimana mengubah bentuk kamus ini ke dalam tense 현재시제 (bentuk sekarang) Untuk merubah kata kerja dalam waktu sekarang, Anda mengambil bentuk kata dasar, dan menambahkan salah satu akhiran berikut: 아요 [a-yo] 어요 [eo-yo] 여요 [Yeo-yo] ** ketiga kata akhiran tersebut merupakan akhiran dalam bahasa Korea tingkat sopan yang biasa di pakai dalam percakapan bahasa korea sehari-hari. Caranya sbb: Jika kata kerja berakhiran vokal ㅏ [a] atau ㅗ [o], diikuti oleh 아요 [a-yo]. Jika vokal terakhir adalah bukan ㅏ [a] atau ㅗ [o], diikuti oleh 어요 [eo-yo]. Dan kata kerja berakhiran 하 [ha], diikuti dengan 해요 [Heo-yo]. Untuk kata kerja dasar berakhiran 이 berubah menjadi 여 Mari kita lihat beberapa contoh : 1)가다 [ga-da] = pergi untuk kata dasar 가 [ga] dan vokal yang terakhir adalah ㅏ [a] maka ditambahkan 아요 [a-yo]. Jadi pertama menjadi 가 + 아요, dan kemudian lebih alami, menjadi 가요 [ga-yo] untuk memudahkan pengucapan.가다 [ga-da] = pergi (bentuk kamus) - 가요 [ga-yo] = aku pergi, Anda pergi, Ia pergi,Dia pergi, Mereka pergi. (Bentuk sekarang) 2)먹다 [meok-da] = makan untuk kata kerja 먹 [meok] dan vokal sebelum kata terakhir adalah ㅓ [eo] sehingga bukan ㅏ atau ㅗ, jadi di Tambahkan 어요 [eo-yo]. menjadi, 먹 + 어요 [MEO-geo-yo] 먹다 [meok-da] = makan (bentuk kamus) 먹어요 [MEO-geo-yo] = saya makan. Anda makan, dan. Dll (bentuk sekarang) *Perhatikan bahwa ada penghubung di lafal* 먹 + 어 [meok + eo] yang terdengar seperti 머거 [MEO-geo]. 3)보다 [bo-da] = melihat, menonton, melihat kata dasar 보 [bo] di ikuti 아요 [a-yo] 보 + 아요 — 봐요 [BWA-yo]. 4)보이다 [bo-i-da] = dilihat, terlihat kata dasar 보이 [bo-i] di ikuti oleh 어요 [eo-yo] 보이 + 어요 — 보여요 [bo-Yeo-yo] 보이다 [bo-i-da] = dilihat, terlihat 보여요 [bo-Yeo-yo] = Ini terlihat. Saya melihatnya. 5)하다 [ha-da] = untuk melakukan kata dasar 하 [ha] diikuti 여요 [Yeo-yo] 하 + 여요 — 하여요 [ha-Yeo-yo] 하여요 menjadi 해요 [Hae-yo]. 6.기다리다 [gi-da-ri-da] kata kerja dasar berakhiran 이 berubah menjadi 여 ( = 기다리 [gi-da-ri]) = menunggu Present Tense: 기다려요 [gi-da-Ryeo-yo] (bukan 기다 리 어요) PELAJARAN 17 Dalam pelajaran sebelumnya, kita melihat cara dasar merubah kata kerja dalam bentuk kamus ke dalam bentuk present tense . Apakah Anda ingat bagaimana? Kata kerja berasal berakhir dengan vokal ㅗ [o] atau ㅏ [a] yang diikuti oleh 아요 [a-yo]. Kata kerja berasal berakhir dengan vokal SELAIN ㅗ atau ㅏ diikuti oleh 어요 [eo-yo]. Kata kerja dasar 하 diikuti oleh 여요 [Yeo-yo]menjadi 해요 [Hae-yo] Sekarang saatnya untuk belajar cara mengubah kata kerja menjadi bentuk lampau. Jika Anda memahami bagaimana mengubah kata dasar menjadi bentuk sekarang 현재시제, memahami bagaimana untuk mengubahnya ke dalam bentuk lampau 과거시제 sama mudah. Aturan serupa diterapkan untuk membuat kalimat bentuk lampau, tambahkan kata berikut di akhir kalimat: 았어요 [a-sseo-yo] 었어요 [eo-sseo-yo] 였어요 [Yeo-sseo-yo] Anda dapat menambahkan kata tersebut setelah kata kerja dasar, atau Anda dapat menganggapnya sebagai hanya menggantikan 요 pada akhir kalimat present tense dengan ㅆ어요 [ss-eo-yo]. Kata kerja berasal berakhir dengan vokal ㅗ [o] atau ㅏ [a] yang diikuti oleh 았어요 [a-sseo-yo]. Kata kerja berasal diakhiri dengan huruf vokal selain ㅗ atau ㅏ diikuti oleh 었어요 [eo-sseo-yo]. kata dasar 하 diikuti oleh 였어요 [Yeo-sse-yo]. Mari kita lihat beberapa contoh. 사다 [sa-da] = membeli kata dasar = 사 [sa] Anda hilangkan akhir 다 [da] dari kata kerja apapun dan Anda mendapatkan kata dasar. bentuk (Waktu) lampau = 사 았어요 [sa + a-sseo-yo]= 샀어요 [sa-sseo-yo]= Saya beli / Anda membeli / ia membeli / ia membeli / mereka membeli / dll 오다 [o-da] = datang kata dasar = 오 [o] bentuk lampau = + 오 았어요 [O + a-sseo-yo]= 왔어요 [wa-sseo-yo]= Saya datang / Anda datang / ia / mereka datang / dia datang / kami datang / dll 하다 [ha-da] = melakukan = 하 [ha] bentuk lampau = + 하 였어요 [ha + Yeo-sseo + yo] = 했어요 [Hae-sseo-yo]= Aku / Anda lakukan / dia / mereka lakukan / dll Contoh kata kerja dalam waktu sekarang dan lampau 1.먹다 [meok-da] ( = 먹 [meok]) = makan bentuk lampau: 먹어요 [MEO-geo-yo] Lampau: 먹었 어요 [MEO-geo-sseo-yo] 2.잡다 [jap-da] ( = 잡 [jap]) = menangkap Present Tense : 잡아요 [ja-ba-yo] bentuk lampau: 잡았 어요 [ja-ba-sseo-yo] 3.팔다 [sobat-da] (kata dasar= 팔 [Phal]) = menjual Present Tense : 팔아요 [pa-ra-yo] bentuk lampau: 팔았 어요 [pa-ra-sseo-yo] 4.놀다 [Nol-da] ( = 놀 [Nol]) = bermain, bergaul Present Tense : 놀아요 [no-ra-yo] bentuk lampau: 놀았 어요 [no-ra-sseo-yo] 5.쓰다 [sseu-da] ( = 쓰 [sseu]) = menulis, menggunakan Present Tense : 써요 [sseo-yo] (bukan 쓰어요) bentuk lampau: 썼어요 [sseo-sseo-yo] 6.기다리다 [gi-da-ri-da] ( = 기다리 [gi-da-ri]) = menunggu Present Tense : 기다려요 [gi-da-Ryeo-yo] (bukan 기다 리 어요) Tegang masa lalu: 기다 렸어요 [gi-da-Ryeo-sseo-yo] 7.이상 하다 [i-sang-ha-da] ( = 이상하 [i-sang-ha]) = menjadi aneh Present Tense : 이상 해요 [i-sang-hae-yo) (bukan 이상하 여요) bentuk lampau: 이상 했어요 [i-sang-hae-sseo-yo] 8.멋있다 [MEO-sit-da] ( = 멋있 [MEO-sit-da]) = Keren, luar biasa Present Tense : 멋있 어요 [MEO-si-sseo-yo] bentuk lampau: 멋있었 어요 [MEO-si-sseo-sseo-yo] PELAJARAN 18 Dalam bahasa Korea, seperti yang anda tau ada beberapa partikel yang digunakan untuk menandai peran sejumlah kata benda, dan sejauh ini, kita telah belajar tentang partikel subjek (이 [i] dan 가 [ga]) dan topik partikel (은 [eun] dan 는 [Neun]). Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan mengulas partikel, 에 [e] dan 에서 [e-seo], dan juga bagaimana mengatakan dimana Pertama mari kita belajar kata DIMANA atau TEMPAT YANG MANA. 어디 [eo-di] = di mana, menanyakan tempat Sekarang, mari kita lihat bagaimana meminta seseorang ke mana Anda ingin pergi ? Dalam bahasa Korea. Pergi = 가다 [ga-da] ingin = 고 싶어요 [go si-po-yo] Apakah Anda ingat bagaimana membentuk kalimat menggunakan 고 싶어요 [go si-po-yo]? Ya, Anda menghilangkan huruf 다 di akhir kata kerja dan menambahkan 고 싶어요 setelah itu. 가다 + 고 싶어요 - 가고 싶어요 [ga-go si-po-yo] = Saya ingin pergi. 가고 싶어요 = Saya ingin pergi. 가고 싶어요? = Apakah Anda ingin pergi? Dan sekarang, Anda hanya menambahkan kata 어디 [eo-di] di depan kata kerja. 어디 가고 싶어요? [Eo-di-ga go si-po-yo?] = Di/ke mana Anda ingin pergi MENGAPA MENGGUNAKAN PARTIKEL LOKASI? Dengan menggunakan partikel lokasi, dapat membuat kalimat sangat jelas. Ada banyak partikel lokasi dalam bahasa Korea, tetapi marilah kita melihat dua partikel yang paling dasar, 에 [e] dan 에서 [e-seo]. 에 [e] = ke,pada, untuk Kata Benda + 에 [e] 에 adalah partike lokasi, tapi tidak hanya digunakan untuk menandai lokasi. yang berarti di , untuk dan sebagainya dan dapat juga digunakan untuk menandai lokasi, waktu, situasi, dan banyak hal lainnya, tapi di sini, kita hanya berfokus pada perannya menandai lokasi Mari kita lihat bagaimana digunakan di dalam kalimat Korea, dengan melihat beberapa kalimat contoh. Contoh1 . Apabila ingin mengatakan Saya pergi ke sekolah .‖Dalam bahasa Korea. 1. pergi = 가다 [ga-da] pergi = 가 + 았어요 = 갔어요 [ga-sseo-yo] 2. sekolah = 학교 [hak-gyo] = 에 [e] pergi ke sekolah. = 학교 에 갔어요. [Hak-gyo-e ga-sseo-yo] Contoh2 Untuk mengatakan‖ Saya datang ke Korea .‖ Dalam bahasa Korea. 1. datang = 오다 [o-da] Saya datang = 오 + 았어요 = 왔어요 [wa-sseo-yo] 2. Korea = 한국 [han-guk] 3. ke = 에 [e] Saya datang ke Korea. = 한국 에 왔어요. [Han-gug-e wa-sseo-yo] Contoh3 Untuk mengatakan Ke mana Anda ingin pergi ?‖ Dalam bahasa Korea. 1. pergi = 가다 [ga-da] Anda ingin pergi = 가 + 고 싶어요 = 가고 싶어요 [ga-go si-po-yo] 2. Di/ke mana = 어디 [eo-di] 3. ke = 에 [e] ke mana Anda ingin pergi? = 어디 에 가고 싶어요? [Eo-di-e-ga go si-po-yo?] Contoh 4 Katakanlah Dimanakah engkau ? Dalam bahasa Korea. 1. ada = 있다 [it-da] = 있 + 어요 = 있어요 [i-sseo-yo] 2. dimana = 어디 [eo-di] 3. di = 에 [e] kamu ada di mana? = 어디 에 있어요? [Eo-di-e i-sseo-yo?] Dimanakah Anda Sekarang berada? = 지금 어디 에 있어요? [Ji geum-eo-di-e i-sseo-yo?] 어디 에 있어요 지금? [Eo-di-e i-sseo-yo ji Geum?] 에서 [e-seo] = di, dalam, dari Kata Benda + 에서 [e-seo] 에서 [e-seo] bisa mengungkapkan banyak hal, tapi di sini mari kita lihat dua peran utama. 에서 [e-seo] menyatakan: 1. lokasi di mana tindakan berlangsung (Contoh. saya belajar di perpustakaan / saya bertemu teman saya di Seoul..) 2. arti dari tempat (Contoh. saya datang dari Seoul / Paket ini berasal dari Spanyol..) Perbedaan antara 에 dan 에서. 에 dan 에서 keduanya dapat diterjemahkan dengan di dalam bahasa Indonesia. Bagaimana perbedaannya? 에 mengungkapkan lokasi di mana sesuatu adalah atau ada‖ Contoh) 집에 있어요. = Saya di rumah. 집에 가요. = Saya mau pulang. 에서 mengungkapkan lokasi di mana beberapa tindakan berlangsung. Contoh) 집에서 일해요. = Saya bekerja di rumah. 집에서 뭐 해요? = Apa yang kamu lakukan di rumah. Kosa kata : 가다 [ga-da] = pergi 가요 [ga-yo] = saya pergi /Anda pergi /dia pergi/mereka pergi/mari kita pergi 갔어요 [ga-sseo-yo] = pergi ke, telah pergi 오다 [o-da] = datang 왔어요 [wa-sseo-yo] = datang, telah datang 있다 [it-da] = menjadi, ada 있었어요 [i-sseo-sseo-yo] = adalah / telah 보다 [bo-da] = melihat 봤어요 [BWA-sseo-yo] = / melihat telah melihat 하다 [ha-da] = melakukan 했어요 [Hae-sseo-yo] = melakukan / telah dilakukan PELAJARAN 19 Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan melihat bagaimana mengatakan KAPAN dalam bahasa Korea, dan juga berlatih menjawab pertanyaan, Kapan Anda melakukannya ? Kapan Anda pergi ? Kapan Anda datang? Kapan Anda bangun, Dll 언제 [eon-je] = Kapan, Tidak seperti 어디 [eo-di], yang harus menambahkan lokasi partikel lokasi untuk memperjelas kalimat, 언제 [eon-je] dapat digunakan sendiri. Sekarang mari kita coba gunakan 언제 dalam konteks kalimat Contoh: 1) ―Kapan kamu melakukan (nya)?‖ ketika, Kapan = 언제 [eon-je] Anda lakukan (itu) = 하다 + 였어요 = 했어요 [Hae-sseo-yo] yang Anda lakukan (itu)? = 했어요? [Hae-sseo-yo?] Kapan Anda melakukannya? = 언제 했어요? [Eon-je-hae sseo-yo?] 2) ―Kapan Anda datang?‖ tiba = 도착 하다 [do-cha-ka-da] Anda tiba = 도착 했어요 [do-cha-kae-sseo-yo] kau tiba? = 도착 했어요? [Do-cha-kae-sseo-yo?] Kapan Anda tiba? = 언제 도착 했어요? [Eon-je do-cha-kae-sseo-yo?]. 3) ―Kapan Anda datang?‖ Datang = 오다 [o-da] Anda datang = 왔어요 [wa-sseo-yo] Mereka datang? = 왔어요? [Wa-sseo-yo?] Kapan Anda datang? = 언제 왔어요? [Eon-je-wa sseo-yo?] 4) ―Kapan Anda bangun?‖ bangun = 일어나다 [i-Reo-na-da] Anda bangun = 일어나요 [i-Reo-na-yo] kita bangun? = 일어나요? [I-Reo-na-yo?] Kapan kita harus bangun? = 언제 일어나요? [Eon-je i-Reo-na-yo?] Beberapa kata keterangan waktu yang perlu di ketahui: 오늘 [o-neul] = hari ini 어제 [eo-je] = kemarin 내일 [nae-il] = besok 지금 [ji-geum] = sekarang 아까 [a-KKA] = sebelumnya/tadi (hari ini), beberapa waktu lalu (hari ini) 이따가 =[i-ta-ga] = Nanti (setelah ini) 나중 에 [na Jung-e] = nanti PELAJARAN 20 Dalam pelajaran nomor 15, kita memperkenalkan beberapa angka sino-Korea: 일 [il = satu] 이 [i = dua] 삼 [sam = tiga] 사 [sa = empat] 오 [O = lima] 육 [yuk = enam] 칠 [chil = tujuh] 팔 [pal = delapan] 구 [gu = sembilan] 십 [sip = sepuluh] 백 [baek = ratus] 천 [cheon = ribu] 만 [man = sepuluh ribu] Dan lain-lain, Sekarang mari kita lihat beberapa angka Korea asli. Ada beberapa kasus angka sino-Korea yang digunakan, kasus di mana angka Korea asli yang digunakan, dan ada juga beberapa kasus di mana sino-Korea angka dan angka Korea asli digunakan bersama-sama. Sebagai contoh: 1. Ketika Anda memberi tahu waktu, Anda harus menggunakan Bilangan Korea asli untuk mengatakan angka jam dan sino-Korea mengatakan menit. 2. Ketika Anda mengatakan usia Anda dalam percakapan sehari-hari, Anda menggunakan nomor Korea asli, tetapi dalam beberapa pengaturan yang sangat formal seperti di pengadilan atau dalam laporan resmi, angka sino-Korea tersebut digunakan untuk menyatakan usia Anda. 3. Ketika Anda menghitung tahun, Anda dapat menggunakan salah satu sino-Korea atau angka Korea asli, tetapi kata-kata yang Anda gunakan untuk menghitung tahun berubah, tergantung pada apakah Anda menggunakan Bilangan sino-Korea dan Bilangan Korea asli. Sekarang, mari kita belajar Bilangan Korea asli dan berlatih mengatakan berapa usia kita. Angka/Bilangan korea Asli 1 하나 [ha-na] 2 둘 [dul] 3 셋 [set] 4 넷 net 5 다섯 [da-seot] 6 여섯 [Yeo-seot] 7 일곱 [il-gop] 8 여덟 [Yeo-Deol] 9 아홉 [a-hop] 10 열 [yeol] Dari 11 menjadi 19 adalah sederhana. Anda hanya menempatkan nomor 10 dan menambahkan nomor lain setelah itu. Ex) 열 (10) + 하나 (1) = 열하나 [yeol-ha-na] (11) 열 (10) + 아홉 (9) = 열아홉 [yeol-hop-] (19) 20 스물 [Seu-mul] Aturan yang sama seperti di atas selama 11 sampai 19 berlaku untuk 21-29, 31-39, 41-49, dan lain-lain 30 서른 [seo-reun] 40 마흔 [ma-Heun] 50 쉰 [Swin] 60 예순 [Ye-sun] 70 일흔 [i-reun] 80 여든 [Yeo-deun] 90 아흔 [a-Heun] Catatan: Dari angka 1 sampai 99, penggunaan bilangan Korea asli umumnya sangat khas yang berbeda dari penggunaan angka sino-Korea , tetapi untuk unit besar seperti 100,, 1.000, 10.000 dan lain-lain, Jadi, 100 dalam jumlah sino-Korea 백 [baek], dan bahkan ketika harus menggunakan nomor Korea asli, di gunakan kata yang sama. Dan ketika Anda ingin mengatakan 101, 102, dan dll, Anda perlu mengkombinasikan sistem bersama. 101 = 백 [baek / 100] (sino-Korea) + 하나 [ha-na / 1] (Korea asli) 205 = 이 [i / 2] (sino-Korea) + 백 [baek / 100] (sino-Korea) + 다섯 [daseot / 5] (asli Ko rea) Mari kita lihat bagaimana berbicara mengenai usia. Ada dua cara untuk mengatakan usia, tapi di sini, mari kita melihat cara yang lebih biasa dan sehari-hari. Apabila menggunakan bilangan Korea asli dan menambahkan 살 [sal] setelah itu. Tapi angka 1, 2, 3, 4, dan bentuk-bentuk perubahan 20 sebelum kata benda. 1 하나 [ha-na] - 한 [han] 살 2 둘 [dul] - 두 [du] 살 3 셋 [Set] - 세 [se] 살 4 넷 Net- 네 [ne] 살 … 20 스물 [Seu-mul] - 스무 [Seu-mu] 살 21 스물 [Seu-mul] - 스물한 [Seu-mul-han] 살 Berikut ini adalah dari usia 1 sampai 100 dalam jumlah Korea asli, diikuti oleh usia 살 [sal]. 한 살 (1), 두 살, 세 살, 네 살, 다섯 살, 여섯 살, 일곱 살, 여덟 살, 아홉 살, 열 살 (10), 열한 살 (11), 열두 살, 열세 살, 열네 살 , 열다섯 살, 열여섯 살, 열일곱 살, 열여덟살, 열아홉 살, 스무 살 (20), 스물한 살 (21), 스물두 살, 스물세 살, 스물네 살, 스물 다섯 살, 스물 여섯 살, 스물 일곱 살, 스물 여덟 살, 스물 아홉 살, 서른 살 (30), 서른한 살 (31), 서른두 살, 서른세 살, 서른네 살, 서른 다섯 살, 서른 여섯 살, 서른 일곱 살, 서른 여덟 살, 서른 아홉 살, 마흔 살 (40), 마흔한 살 (41), 마흔두 살, 마흔세 살, 마흔네 살, 마흔 다섯 살, 마흔 여섯 살, 마흔 일곱 살, 마흔 여덟 살 , 마흔 아홉 살, 쉰 살 (50), 쉰한 살 (51), 쉰두 살, 쉰세 살, 쉰네 살, 쉰다섯 살, 쉰여섯 살, 쉰일곱 살, 쉽여덟 살, 쉰아홉 살, 예순 살 (60 ), 예순한 살 (61), 예순두 살, 예순세 살, 예순네 살, 예순 다섯 살, 예순 여섯 살, 예순 일곱 살, 예순 여덟 살, 예순 아홉 살, 일흔 살 (70), 일흔한 살 (71), 일흔두 살, 일흔세 살, 일흔네 살, 일흔 다섯 살, 일흔 여섯 살, 일흔 일곱 살, 일흔 여덟 살, 일흔 아홉 살, 여든 살 (80), 여든한 살 (81), 여든 두 살, 여든세 살, 여든네 살, 여든 다섯 살, 여든 여섯 살, 여든 일곱 살, 여든 여덟 살, 여든 아홉 살, 아흔 살 (90), 아흔한 살 (91), 아흔두 살, 아흔세 살, 아흔네 살, 아흔 다섯 살, 아흔 여섯 살, 아흔 일곱 살, 아흔 여덟 살, 아흔 아홉 살, 백 살 (100) Apakah sudah Ditemukan usia Anda? Sekarang, katakanlah usia dan menambahkan 이에요 [I-e-yo] setelah itu. 한 살이 에요. Saya satu tahun. 열 살이 에요. Saya sepuluh tahun. 스무 살이 에요. Saya dua puluh tahun. 서른 살이 에요. Saya berumur tiga puluh tahun. Bahasa Korea L.I(21-25) PELAJARAN 21 Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan melihat bagaimana membuat kalimat negatif dalam bahasa Korea. Bagaimana membuat kalimat negatif dalam bahasa Korea Ada dua cara untuk melakukan ini yaitu: 1. Menambahkan 안 [sebuah] sebelum kata kerja 2. Menggunakan kata kerja berakhir negatif, 지 않다 [ji an-ta] Metode # 1 adalah lebih sederhana dan lebih sehari-hari, dan metode # 2 adalah relatif formal tapi tidak hanya untuk situasi formal. Jika ingin menggunakan metode # 1, dan tambahkan 안 [tidak/bukan] sebelum kata kerja, itu lebih mudah daripada metode # 2 karena tidak perlu khawatir tentang tenses yang dapat merubah kalimat . Kata dasar 안 [tidak/bukan]. Contoh 가다 [ga-da] = pergi 집에 가요. [Jib-e ga-yo] Aku pulang. 집에 안 가요. [Jib-e an-ga-yo] Saya TIDAK pulang. 집에 안 가요? [Jib-e an-ga-yo?] Anda TIDAK pulang? 버리다 [beo-ri-da] = membuang 그거 버렸어요. [Geu-geo-beo Ryeo-sseo-yo] Saya membuangnya 그거 안 버렸어요. [Geu-geo an beo-Ryeo-sseo-yo] AKU TIDAK membuangnya. 그거 아직 안 버렸어요. [Geu-geo a-jik an beo-Ryeo-sseo-yo] AKU TIDAK membuangnya. Contoh menggunakan metode # 2 (menambahkan 지 않다 [ji an-ta] 지 않다 [ji anta] perlu menyesuaikan dengan bentuk kalimat Present Tense: 지 않아요 [ji a-na-yo] Bentuk lampau: 지 않았어요 [ji a-na-sseo-yo] *Anda dapat menerapkan aturan yang sama seperti untuk kata kerja lain* 가다 [ga-da] = pergi 가지 않다 [ga-ji an-ta] = tidak pergi 가지 않아요 [ga-ji a-na-yo] = Saya TIDAK pergi. 가지 않았어요 [ga-ji a-na-sseo-yo] = AKU TIDAK pergi. 버리다 [beo-ri-da] = membuang 버리지 않다 [beo-ri-ji an-ta] = tidak membuang 버리지 않아요 [beo-ri-ji a-na-yo] = Saya TIDAK membuangnya. 버리지 않았어요 [beo-ri-ji a-na-sseo-yo] AKU TIDAK membuangnya. Contoh dialog: 1. J: 아파요? [A-pa-yo?] = Apakah itu sakit? B: 안 아파요. [A-pa-yo] = Ini tidak sakit. J: 안 아파요? 진짜 안 아파요? [A-pa-yo? jin-JJA a-pa-yo?= Ini benar- benar tidak sakit? B: 안 아파요. [A-pa-yo] = Ini tidak sakit. Contoh dialog: 2. J: 안 먹어요? [An MEO-geo-yo?] = Anda tidak makan? B: 안 먹어요! [An MEO-geo-yo!] = Saya tidak makan! J: 정말 안 먹어요? 맛있 어요! [Jeong-mal An MEO-geo-yo? ma-si-sseo-yo] = Anda benar-benar tidak makan? Ini lezat. B: 안 먹어요. 배 안 고파요. [An MEO-geo-yo. Bae an go-pa-yo] = Saya tidak makan. Saya tidak lapar Contoh dialog: 3. J: 이거 매워요? [I-geo-mae wo-yo?] = Apakah ini pedas? B: 아니요. 안 매워요. [A-ni-yo. An mae-wo-yo] = tidak Ini tidak pedas. J: 진짜 안 매워요? [Jin-JJA An mae-wo-yo?] = Benar-benar tidak pedas? B: 네. 안 매워요. [Ne. An mae-wo-yo] = Tidak, ini tidak pedas. PELAJARAN 22 Dalam pelajaran # 16, kita belajar bagaimana membuat bentuk kamus kata kerja ke dalam saat ini (현재 시제: hyeon-je- si-je) dan pada pelajaran # 17, kita belajar bagaimana membuat bentuk lampau (과거 시제: GWA geo-si-je). Dan kita juga belajar bahwa kata kerja 하다 [hada] memiliki cara yang sangat unik dalam perubahannya. 하다 [ha-da] = melakukan Bentuk Sekarang = 하 + 여요 = 해요 [Hae-yo] Bentuk lampau = 하 + 였어요 = 했어요 Kita juga menyebutkan bahwa kata kerja 하다 adalah kata yang sangat kuat dan berguna. Itu karena dalam bahasa Korea ada banyak kata kerja yang dibuat dengan menggabungkan kata benda dengan 하다. Banyak kata benda Korea yang menunjukkan atau menjelaskan beberapa tindakan atau perilaku dapat dikombinasikan dengan 하다. Dan mereka menjadi kata kerja. Contoh 1. 공부 = Pelajaran / 공부 하다 = mempelajari 2. 일 = kerja, pekerjaan / 일하다 = bekerja 3. 기억 = Ingatan / 기억 하다 = Mengingat 4. 청소 = pembersihan / 청소 하다 = membersihkan 5. 요리 = memasak, piring / 요리 하다 = memasak 6. 이 사 = bergerak / 이사 하다 = untuk pindah, pindah ke rumah yang berbeda 7. 노래 = lagu / 노래하다 = menyanyi 8. 노력 = usaha / 노력 하다 = untuk melakukan upaya, berusaha keras 9. 동의 = perjanjian, menyetujui / 동의 하다 = setuju 10. 인정 =pengakuan / 인정 하다 = mengakui 11. 후회 = penyesalan / 후회 하다 = menyesal 12. 운동 = latihan / 운동 하다 = berolahraga 13. 사랑 = cinta / 사랑 하다 = untuk mencintai 14. 말 = kata-kata, bahasa / 말하다 = berbicara 15. 생각 = pemikiran, ide / 생각 하다 = berpikir Membuat kalimat negatif dengan 하다 kata kerja Untuk membuat kalimat negatif menggunakan 하다 kata kerja (lihat Pelajaran # 21 tentang cara membuat kalimat negatif dalam bahasa Korea) Anda hanya perlu untuk memisahkan bagian kata benda dan bagian 하다 dan menambah 안 diantaranya. Contoh: 생각 하다 - 생각 안 하다 노력 하다 - 노력 안 하다 Dan jika Anda ingat dari Pelajaran # 16, ada dua cara untuk membuat kalimat negatif di Korea: menambahkan 안 sebelum kata kerja dan menggunakan kata kerja berakhir 지 않다. Jika Anda ingin menggunakan 지 않다 dengan kata kerja 하다, Anda cukup menggabungkan 하다 [ha-da] menjadi 하지 않다 [ha-ji an-ta]. PELAJARAN 23 누구 [nu-gu] = Siapa masih Ingat subjek partikel dan topik partikel? Subject partikel: 이 [i] / 가 [ga] Topik partikel: 은 [eun] / 는 [Neun] Partikel subjek menekankan subjek dan menunjukkan siapa' melakukan sesuatu, atau apa yang' sedang di-jelaskan, dan partikel topik menekankan topik kalimat dan menunjukkan apa' atau siapa' yang Anda bicarakan. Bila Anda ingin mengajukan pertanyaan sederhana seperti Siapa yang melakukannya? Siapa yang membantunya?‖ Atau ―Siapa yang membuatnya?‖, Anda menekankan subjek, yang merupakan kata siapa‖ di sini, jadi Anda perlu menggunakan subjek partikel이 [i] atau 가 [ga]. 누구 berakhir dengan vokal sehingga harus diikuti oleh 가 tapi 누구 ditambah 가‖ berubah menjadi 누가 bukan 누구 가 tapi 누구 [nu-gu] = siapa 누구 [nu-gu] + 가 [ga] = 누구 가 - 누가 [nu-ga] Ingatlah bahwa ini HANYA bila menekankan ‗siapa' sebagai subyek dari suatu tindakan Bandingkan contoh-contoh ini: Anda ingin bertanya ―Siapa itu?‖ Dalam bahasa Korea, 누구 (nu-gu) + 예요 (ye yo) = 누구 예요? [Nu-gu-ye-yo?] Anda ingin bertanya ―? (Di antara orang-orang ini, tak lain) Siapa Jane‖ Anda dapat mengatakan: 누구 (nu gu) + 가 ga) + 제인 (je in) + 이에요? (I e yo?) = 누가 제인 이에요? [Nu-ga je-in-i-e-yo?] bila ingin bertanya ―Siapa yang melakukannya?‖: 누구 (nu gu) + 가 (ga) + 했어요? (hae sseo yo?) = 누가 했어요? [nu-ga-hae sseo-yo?] Contoh kalimat 1. 누가 전화 했어요? [Nu-ga jeon-hwa-hae-sseo-yo?] Siapa yang menelepon? 2. 이거 누구 예요? [I-geo nu-gu-ye-yo?] Siapa ini? (Ini siapa?) 3. 어제 누가 왔어요? [Eo-je nu-ga wa-sseo-yo?] Siapa yang datang kemarin? 4. 그거 누가 만들었 어요? [Geu-geo nu-ga man-deu-Reo-sseo-yo?] Siapa yang membuat itu? 5. 누가 샀어요? [Nu-ga sa-sseo-yo?] Siapa yang membelinya? PELAJARAN 24 Sejauh ini, melalui pelajaran sebelumnya, kita telah belajar bagaimana mengatakan apa, dimana, kapan‖ dan, siapa‖. Apa = 뭐 [MWO] Dimana = 어디 [eo-di] Ketika = 언제 [eon-je] Siapa = 누구 [nu-gu] Dan hari ini, kita akan belajar 의문사 Kalimat tanya(interogatif). Bagaimana = 어떻게 [eo-tteo-ke] Mengapa = 왜 [wae] Berapa banyak (uang) = 얼마 [eol-ma] Bagaimana + kata sifat / kata keterangan = 얼마나 [eol-ma-na] Umumnya interogatif dalam bahasa Korea digunakan sebelum kata kerja dalam kalimat. Tapi pemakaiannya jauh lebih fleksibel (sebagian pengganti subjek / topik / object ). Contoh 1. 어떻게 [eo-tteo-ke] = bagaimana 어떻게 찾았 어요? [Eo-tteo-ke cha-ja-sseo-yo?] = Bagaimana Anda menemukannya? (찾 다 = menemukan, mencari 어떻게 왔어요? [Eo-tteo-ke wa-sseo-yo?] = Bagaimana anda bisa di sini? (오다 = datang) 2. 왜 [wae] = mengapa 왜 전화 했어요? [Wae jeon-hwa-hae-sseo-yo?] = Mengapa Anda menelepon? (전화 하다 = menelpon) 왜 안 왔어요? [Wae sebuah wa-sseo-yo?] = Kenapa anda tidak datang? (오다 = datang) 3. 얼마 [eol-ma] = berapa banyak 얼마 예요? [Eol-ma-ye-yo?] = Berapa harganya? 얼마 냈어요? [Eol-ma nae-sseo-yo?] = Berapa banyak yang Anda bayarkan? (내다 = membayar) 4. 얼마나 + kata sifat / kata keterangan = bagaimana + [sering / cepat / awal / segera / dll …] 얼마나 자주 와요? [Eol-ma-na ja-ju wa-yo?] = Seberapa sering Anda datang? (자주 = sering / 오다 = datang) 얼마나 커요? [Eol-ma-na Keo-yo?] = Seberapa besar itu? (크다 = besar) 얼마나 무거워요? [Eol-ma-na mu-geo-wo-yo?] = Seberapa berat itu? (무겁다 = berat) PELAJARAN 25 Dalam pelajaran ini, kita akan memperkenalkan cara untuk mengatakan ―dari A ke B‖ ketika berbicara tentang lokasi dan ―dari A sampai B‖ ketika berbicara tentang waktu. , 에서 [e-seo] dan 부터 [bu-teo] berarti ―dari‖ dan 까지 [KKA-ji] berarti ―untuk‖ atau ―sampai‖ Pertama, mari kita lihat bagaimana mengatakan ―dari A‖ di Korea. Pada dasarnya, 에서 [e-seo] dan 부터 [bu-teo] keduanya berarti ―dari‖ dan keduanya biasanya saling dipertukarkan에서 dikaitkan lebih sering dengan lokasi dan 부터 dikaitkan lebih sering dengan waktu. Seperti semua partikel lain, 부터, 에서, dan 까지 digunakan SETELAH kata benda atau kata ganti. ―Dari A‖ dalam bahasa Korea adalah ―A 에서‖ atau ―A 부터‖ Contoh 1. Dari Seoul= 서울 에서 [seo-ul-e-seo] = 서울 부터 [seo-ul-bu-te] = mulai dari Seoul‖ 2. Mulai sekarang= 지금 부터 [ji Geum-bu-teo]= 지금 에서 [ji Geum-e-seo] (salah) 3. Dari (atau Sejak) kemarin= 어제 부터 [eo-je-bu-teo] Sekarang, ke B atau sampai B‖ dalam bahasa Korea adalah B 까지 [KKA-ji].‖ Contoh 1. (Dari tempat lain) ke Seoul/sampai Soul= 서울 까지 [seo-ul-KKA-ji] 2. Sampai saat ini= 지금 까지 [ji Geum-KKA-ji] 3. Sampai besok= 내일 까지 [nae-il-KKA-ji] Contoh selanjutnya: 1. Dari sini ke sana = 여기 에서 저기 까지 = 여기 부터 저기 까지 2. Dari kepala sampai kaki = 머리 부터 발끝 까지 = 머리 에서 발끝 까지 3. Dari Seoul ke Busan = 서울 에서 부산 까지 = 서울 부터 부산 까지 4. Dari pagi sampai malam = 아침 부터 저녁 까지 = 아침 에서 저녁 까지 Pelajaran berikutnya Tata Bahasa Bahasa Korea (1-10)A . .

The view jerked suddenly and a second figure became visible. The two figures faced off; there was a flash of a knife and a distorted shout echoed through her mind. The image blurred as one of the men lunged. A few moments of confused movement and stifled curses ended in a sharp grunt of pain. The image sharpened suddenly and revealed the prone form of the young man, his shirt soaked through with crimson blood.

She didn't look at him. \"Hey, don't do this,\" he said, coaxingly. \"Dee.\" He waited for her to look at him. His blue eyes were sincere and concerned. \"Don't run.\" She gave him a rueful half smile. \"You don't have to chase me.\" His eyes and voice turned pleading, with a desperate smile and little laugh. \"You don't have to run.\" She let her eyes drift over him and around the room and back. \"No. I could stay and let you put that thing on me. But we both know I won't do that. I can't.\" \"You know I'll catch you,\" he told her. \"I don't know any such thing,\" she said, a little sadly, as she moved towards the door. \"It doesn't have to be like this, Dee,\" he said, making it sound like a promise. But she knew all about promises. \"Doesn't it?\" She bolted, knocking a chair over in her wake and shooting out the door. She could hear him coming behind her. If he caught her, it would be over. She understood it. He understood it. This was the only chance she had to get away. It was all she knew; to run. Dee swerved down a hallway and grabbed a fire extinguisher off the wall as she went. The window at the end of the hall smashed easily. Down the fire escape to the ground below. She could see him above her, coming down fast. She hit the ground running, darting away down the alley, weaving between the human obstacles that walked the sidewalk. \"Stop!\" he shouted. He was bigger than her, it was harder for him to slip between the bodies. \"Stop her!\" Just like him to cheat, wasn't it? Hands started grasping at her, but she spun away into the street. Death on four wheels sped towards her, went passed as she dodged this way and that. \"No! Dee!\" he yelled. She could hear the fear that constricted his throat. She wondered if he knew what it felt like to be afraid the way she was. If he could feel the fear that made her run. On the other side of the road, she did not have to worry about cars crushing her body, only more people crushing her escape. Tires squealed and drivers yelled as he made his way across the street after her. Part of her wanted him to get hit, but only a little. Around the corner, down the sidewalk, into an alley, back out and down, over and up. She could no longer hear him, no longer feel his presence behind her, and knew that she had lost him. It had been easier than she would have thought, given all his big talk. But, that was the way of things. They talked big, but when it came to it, that's all it was: talk. She slowed down, practically strolling down the street, now. Free as a bird. After a few blocks, she even stopped looking over her shoulder. She breathed a sigh. Relief, yes. She idly wondered how long he would search blindly before giving up. Perhaps he had already. What to do? She hummed a little tune as she walked, feeling the breeze on her face. She let her feet take her where they would, she had no place to be, after all. It wasn't until she stepped onto the bridge that crossed the little river that she realized she'd entered the park. The trees were lovely, leaves in shades of gold, red, orange. Falling to earth like the snowflakes that would follow in only a month or two. She stood at the center of the bridge and gazed down into the water. It was rippling gently, but smooth enough she could see her reflection. She looked like a free woman. She smiled at herself. Another reflection joined hers. Before she could react, he'd grabbed her wrist in that vise-like grip of his. He looked down at her as she stared at him in shock, blue eyes filled with triumph. \"How-\" He grinned over her surprise, obviously feeling every bit the victor he was. \"I thought you'd come here,\" he told her. He reached into his pocket and tugged her close. He showed it to her, the thing she had be running from. It was awful and awing. She could swear his eyes were twinkling as he slipped it on, sealing her fate. \"Say it,\" he commanded. A tear slipped down her cheek. \"Yes, Fletcher. I'll marry you.\" He pulled her close and pressed his lips to hers. She kissed back, clinging to him, feeling the cool metal of the ring around her finger. She could never run again. He'd taken away her escape and, she was surprised to find, given her something she'd never really had. \"I love you, Dee,\" he whispered against her lips. She felt truly free for the first time in her life as she whispered those words back to him, another tear falling away. \"No more running,\" he ordered, wrapping strong arms around her. She slipped her own arms about his waist, pressing her face into his neck. She nodded. After all, she'd just realized that her whole life she'd thought she was running away from something, when really she'd been running toward it; this moment, this man. \"No more running.\" R&R.; Don't ask why, just do it.

He can't give her an answer she would be able to understand. So he tells her he doesn't really remember, and she pretends to believe him. The truth is that although his memory isn't too clear, there are some things he would rather forget. From the moment Knott placed the halo on his head to the moment he woke up to hear Lara saying his name over and over again, a whole eternity had passed. The last conscious thought he remembered was his astonishment as he was being charged with Witwer's murder, but even that barely had time to register before everything went black. Gideon had told him that the prisoners saw all their dreams come true, but if it was so, Anderton doesn't remember it. He supposes it was easier for the living to believe it. The only dream that gave him comfort was the one he is trying to push out of his mind now. It bore a frightening resemblance to his present: Lara pregnant, Lara looking at him, radiant with love, Lara watching the rain as he held her. He welcomes their occasional fights because they bind him to reality. He has trouble sleeping because he is afraid of waking up and finding out that it was all a dream. Even then, in his suspended state, he knew it wasn't real and it tore at him. But mostly he was hovering in some kind of limbo. When he looks back on it, he imagines himself floating in some white milkiness that enveloped and soothed him. He thinks the precogs must have felt like that. Gideon had also told him that being halo'd gave people visions. Anderton is willing to believe that. His nightmares were full of strange images and familiar people. They were much weirder than anything he saw when he was high on neuroin. His memories of those visions are blurred and he has no desire to change it. Sometimes he dreamed of being in Pre-Crime headquarters, sorting through the images of an approaching disaster. He was always too late to stop it. Sometimes he was driving along the maglev, but something went wrong and all the cars tumbled down from the vertical road. It was an eerie sensation, falling. Sometimes he dreamed of changing his eyes again, but this time Eddie Solomon wanted payback. They all did. In one of his more persistent nightmares he found himself in the containment section, but this time he was in the very center of it. All the other containers surrounded him and the halo'd were staring at him, their eyes bright like the fluorescent lights of the room. It was unbearable. He dreamed of everyone staring accusingly at him, from the advertisements in the malls that were calling his name, to the subway passengers, looking up from their newspapers. He didn't understand what his crime was, and he could never make out what breaking news was flashing through the headlines. He tried to hide from them, but the spyders always found him, no matter what crack he managed to slip through. Occasionally, he got visits from people. At first it surprised him; he had never heard that the halo'd were allowed visitors. But then he realized they were not real either. Lamar came often, Lara never showed up. Dr Hineman received him in her botanical panopticum. She poured him some of her disgusting tea and morphed into Miss Van Eyck. His parents, despite being gone for nearly fifteen years, also came. They were clearly disappointed in him, and for the first time in his life he didn't care. Wally came, with Agatha slung across his shoulder. \"Like a mermaid\", Anderton thought for some reason. She was listless and didn't say a word. Sean came to see him once. Only once. John never tells Lara about it, but he never looks for him again either. He supposes it's some sort of closure, but it does nothing to alleviate the pain. The moment he set his (in his dreams they are his, not Mr. Yakimoto's) eyes on his boy, he caught his breath. Sean looked six years older, as he should, and Anderton was desperately trying to take it all in, the smallest details of his appearance, the most insignificant changes. Sean looked at him sadly and said: \"You gotta have faith, Dad\". Anderton started to laugh, but what came out was a choked sob. \"It's a little late for that\", he said. \"You wanna hear something funny?\" Sean offered. Anderton stared at him in dismay. \"I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father. He took me all over the world.\" He shrugged. Anderton finally gathered the courage to ask the most important question: \"Are you alive?\" \"No. He got tired of pretending.\" Anderton closed his eyes. \"Forgive me,\" he thought. \"I know you would have done anything to find me. I know you would have died for me,\" Sean was looking at him earnestly. \"I wanted to.\" \"Goodbye, Dad\" Anderton tried to stop him, but it was useless. Sometimes he thinks that maybe he should tell Lara. He used to think that not knowing was the worst thing, but now he is not so sure. Perhaps he'll tell her one day. But not now. His next visitor was a surprise. John had never expected to see Danny Witwer. It wasn't really fair: he had done nothing to the guy, so why was he haunting him? Danny looked practically the same; only some dangerous gleam was gone from his eyes. Anderton suddenly remembered the last time he had seen Witwer: angry, bruised, staring at him through the car factory window. And their encounter in the elevator - Danny's triumphant smirk freezing at the sound of the alarm. \"I didn't kill you,\" Anderton said with some shame, because he had certainly been tempted to. He probably wouldn't have killed Witwer, but he hated the guy. Witwer smirked, \"Like I didn't know.\" \"Then what are you doing here?\" Danny's grin faded. \"Who killed you?\" \"What do you think?\" \"You found out about her.\" Somehow it wasn't that surprising. \"You figured it out.\" \"Not all of it,\" Witwer's tone was bitter. \"So stupid. I should have known.\" Anderton didn't really know what to say to that, so he settled for some non-committal grunt. \"You should do something about it,\" Witwer said. \"You can't just let him get away with it.\" \"What do you expect me to do? In case you haven't noticed, I'm halo'd, or we wouldn't be talking right now!\" \"And you were so sure that the system was perfect.\" \"We all make mistakes, don't we?\" That was a low blow, and Anderton regretted it immediately. \"I wanted your job. I would have been good at it. Could have made Chief of Pre-Crime at twenty-six,\" Witwer was talking in a small strange voice. \"Yeah.\" Anderton knew all about it. For the past six years his life had been made of \"what ifs\". Time passed. He was never sure how many days he had spent there, but Lamar never came to see him again after Danny Witwer. John couldn't say he regretted it. He dreamed of Agatha again. This time she was without Wally. \"Ditched your boyfriend?\" the joke was lame, and he knew it. \"Poor John,\" she touched the top of his head, and for the first time he realized that his hair had been shaved off. \"Are you back in the Temple?\" he asked. It was one of the things he was most ashamed of. \"Don't worry. I'm not going to stay there forever.\" \"Good for you,\" he said without much conviction. \"I saw your future,\" she said. John knew he didn't have one, but it was a dream and he didn't want to interrupt it. However, Agatha didn't say anything more. Instead she grabbed his shoulder and started shaking him. Anderton likes to think that this is the moment Lara rescued him. He hopes that this is what Agatha meant, that Lara is his future. He wants it to be so, but he cannot be sure. He didn't have a chance to ask Agatha, and he knows that she wouldn't have told him anyway. But that's OK. He has seen too much of the future already and he has lived too long in the past. This is now. . ","Summary":" Sometimes, after everything is over, Lara asks him what it was like, being halo'd.

It's a Danny Witwer/OC fic... If there are sintax, grammar or any other kind of mistakes just let me know... --- There To Be Loved --- \"Danny... for God's sake! You have to stop being so... so... damn ! I can't even find a word to describe you, you're terrible, you're the worst person I've ever met! You think people are stupid, don't you? If one day you find yourself alone, well I'm sure you can easily understand why!\" she spat out, she probably didn't even mean those words, they just were what she felt in that moment. She was angry, yeah, so damn angry . He could read it in her eyes as she was crying in front of him and tears were falling from her wonderful blue eyes. He loved those eyes... and as he saw those tears he didn't understand why his heart felt like if someone had stuck a knife in it. \"I'm sorry, I... I just...\" he tried to say, but she cut him off. \"you what ? You just want to reach your purpose, without looking no one in the face... you don't care if the man you're trying to put in jail with no motivation has lost his child! You go on your own direction like a goddamn tank without caring about other people's feelings! and I'm sick of this!\" she paused breathing deeply, then spoke again, or better she yelled again. \"You perfectly know that the woman you talked to today is trying to recover... but no ! you're too smart to care! you just go on with your disrespectful words against the man she loved...\" she paused once again, she threw herself on the armchair in front of him. \"And the same goes for everybody else... you behave like this also with me... what do you want from me now? Can't you see that everytime you're down I'm always there for you?\" she yelled, he nodded: she was right, she was the only one that would give a damn about him and that was one of the reasons why he loved her. \"But... you know what really hurts me the most?\" she asked, then paused waiting for him to react: he just shook his head. \"Well tonight I'm feeling horribly and anyone could tell I could use some comforting... but again, no! Tonight you don't have time! Isn't this simply absurd ?\" his eyes were stinging and he could feel the tears coming. \"Last night when you called me to tell me about your sadistic plan to break Anderton, did you even care about what I was doing?- the man gulped fighting back the tears, then shook his head in response for her question. \"That's exactly what I'm talking about! Dammit Danny! Can't you see you just don't care? I'd been working for months without having a goddamn day off, last night I had finally got a free evening to spend with my friends and I gave it up to see you and listen to your problems, to give you advices... beacuse you're important to me! We're best friends Danny, it's not that you talk and I listen all the time! you have to respect me, to care for me for Heaven's sake! I left my friends because I was busy running to you, just because you asked me! Can you understand this?\" she cried between the tears. He finally broke down: \"I'm sorry Kim... damn! You perfectly know I need you ... I need you more than the air... I can't breathe without you... without hearing your voice, without seeing your eyes and without seeing your smile... you're the only friend I have...\" Tears were now pouring from his eyes and as she saw them her heart seemed to stop, but he had hurt her too many times, too many tears she had cried for him... \"Well... you know what? you're wrong... for I WAS the only friend you HAD ...\" she spat out angrily, then strode off and run outside, in the rain, in the people, in the traffic, with tears falling unstoppable. They'd always been one, and in that moment their tears were falling together, just like one... That memory crossed Detective Danny Witwer's mind as Lamar Burgess started speaking, he knew he was going to die after all, he had been feeling that all the time he had been speaking, but he wasn't afraid of dying... he just didn't want to... he wanted to talk with her one more time, to see her face and to see her smile. But most of all to apologize... he couldn't leave like that, he simply couldn't . Suddenly a sound startled him and the pain spread across his body, his heart was beating faster and his breath was heavy, he looked down, at his chest, there was blood, but damn! What had happened? he looked Lamar: he had the gun still pointed at him, and he was approaching him slowly, he was speaking but Danny couldn't understand what he was saying, in his mind only her: the woman he loved, yes, because he had undestood it finally, he was in love with her... She wasn't just a friend and he loved her too much to die without seeing her at least once again, he didn't want to. He looked Lamar, he was still approaching him, but all of a sudden he stopped, a sound broke into the house, blood pouring out of Lamar's shoulder, blood on the floor behind him, then green , a lot of green as he dived himself in those wonderful eyes, once so angry, now worried and caring, he heard Lamar groaning, then falling on the ground, the gun still in is hand, soft paces, a pair of green All Star, he knew them... a hand grabbing the gun in the man's hands, then that soft hand, caressing his face, stroking his hair, kissing his forehead. \"Kim...\" he heard himself whisper, out of breath, with the pain killing him, his eyes closed, slowly as the girl was taking him by the arms, dragging him in a bed, yeah... he now recalled, it was John Anderton's bed, then all went off, the light, the volume, he felt nothing, he heard nothing, he saw nothing. \"Danny... please just wake up...\" he heard her voice, but he thought it was a dream, then he slowly opened his eyes, his chest ached, and his breath was heavy, he saw her, smiling at him, was it a dream? or was he dead? Her hand on his, lips burnt by the sun, when did she burnt herself? he didn't know, he slowly sat up, looked around, he was still in John Anderton's bed... but it was covered in bloodstains, he slightly smiled: that man would have killed him seeing the stains on his bed \"What happened?\" he found himself asking, but he didn't actually want to know \"Lamar shot you... I shot him... he's left... you're safe...\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks, he didn't understand why everytime he saw her she had tears pouring from her eyes, then everything was clear. \"I was so frightened you wouldn't wake up...\" she whispered. \"I'm sorry...\" he sad, the girl couldn't speak anymore, she just shook her head slowly, crying silently, he lifted his hand, gently caressing her cheek, weeping away the tears with his thumb. The dream of her, wasn't a dream anymore, she had come back, back to him, back in his arms, there for him, there to be hugged, there to be kissed \"I love you...\" he said, the girl gasped, then finally smiled and threw her arms around his neck \"I thought I'd lost you...\" she whispered in his ear \"You never will...\" he whispered back, stroking her hair, so soft, so long, so wavy, they smelled like cinnamon, he loved cinnamon. He slowly moved her hair on the side of her head, freeing the neck, he pressed his lips on her shoulder breathing her scent, then tracing all the way up to her jaw, slowly, sweetly. He caught a tear with his lips, gently sucking it, rubbing her lips with his thumb, tears stopping pouring as she softly moaned in pain \"Forgive me...\" he whispered, she smiled then pressed her lips on his, catching him by surprise, his eyes widened, his eyes closed, his hands run through her hair, his tongue explored her mouth, her lips curved in a smile \"You're forgiven... but you were already...\" she said as they parted, her smile made him smile, happiness spread all through his body, pain left, he leaned in for another kiss... there she was for him, to be hugged, to be kissed, to be touched... to be loved. ---Fin--- So... this was just another fic... now review please!

But it is not. He wakes up from the dreams (dreams?), shaking, gasping, his heart hammering. He feels like a fish, snatched out of water. The world is blurred and distant. He doesn't know where he is, who, with who or when. He can barely think, let alone speak. Is this real? Is this now? Wait, this is something he dimly remembers. He blinks, gasps again and whispers: \"Agatha?\" And then there is the voice, so achingly familiar and full of love, that he wants to cry. The voice says: \"It's Lara, John. Wake up.\" He knows that she has come to save him. He doesn't quite understand how and quickly pushes back the thought. She is here. He will be free. Everything will be all right. This is what matters. He smiles. Because it is as they say, and the dreams of the halo'd do come true. HOUSE BY THE LAKE \"Sean? Sean? Have you seen a little boy in red shorts?\" Rising panic in his voice, eyes frantically searching the crowd. \"Sean?!\" he is desperate now. Desperate, and frozen with terror. \"SEAN?\" \"Over here, Daddy!\" His son is a few feet away from him, at the ice-cream stand. John rushes to him and holds him tight. He doesn't realize how lucky they are until later that night local news report that a little boy of Sean's age went missing in the pool that day. He doesn't want to think about it. For a long time John and Lara don't let their boy out of their sight, but gradually the fear fades. Everything does. Sean goes to school and takes up running. He is a good kid, and his parents are proud of him. He doesn't have many friends because he is wary of strangers, but the few friends he makes, he keeps. He doesn't like swimming and never goes to the pool anymore. So he can't match his Daddy's record of holding breath underwater, but he will run as fast as his Dad. And he trains even harder. They move to their house by the lake and give up the apartment in Washington, because, really, a city is no place for raising kids. Sean has a little sister now. He also has a dog, a rabbit and a fox. He wants to be a vet. Sometimes John takes his son to D.C. On Sean's twelfth birthday they take a tour of the Pre-Crime Headquarters. Sean is fascinated by what he sees. His father - not so much, because secretly he prefers old-fashioned policework. Sean grows up and enrolls into Police Academy. He falls in love with a med student named Claire. He is twenty three. He proposes to her at Christmas. Two years later they get married. Sean is twenty-eight when he starts working at Pre-Crime. He is a good precop, and is well liked by his fellow officers, by Captain Witwer and even by the old recluse Lamar Burgess, who is rumored to still have everything under control. Sean Anderton is thirty-two years old, when he wanders into the Temple. He never feels comfortable there, near this big pool, especially when Wally is out. Suddenly the female Precog grabs his arm and asks him breathlessly, \"Can you see?\" FADE TO BLACK \"Daddy!\" Sean is running to him. \"Daddy! Look what I've got!\" He can hardly see his son because of the tears. He reaches out to touch him even though he knows it is futile. Six years worth of images is all he has now. Images of his boy laughing, running, playing. Images of the boy who is lost forever. For Lara the sandal the FBI found means that Sean is alive somewhere. For her it is like a sign, the first trace they have had in many months. Anderton knows better. He has seen it too many times before in his line of work. But even his pain and guilt are not so unbearable as the pictures his imagination keeps conjuring. Every time he looks through the files they carefully stored up for family history - birthdays, picnics, games - he keeps seeing other things, horrifying, excruciating. Things that drive him crazy. Things that cannot be obliterated. Things that make him want to go out and kill somebody. And when he takes out his gun, his hands don't tremble and the bullet doesn't go through the ceiling. It hits home. THE GIRL \"Can you see?\" she asks. \"See what?\" he snaps. What he can see right now is a gaunt, flat-chested girl with lanky hair who he has already mentally labeled \"Fish-Eyes\". She is pale, plain and almost painfully thin, this Agatha Not-So-Lively. Her bulging eyes stare somewhere past him so intensely that he is almost tempted to look over his shoulder even though he knows there's just a blank white wall behind him. He can't tell her age. She could be anything from fifteen to forty. Weird creature. Probably a neuroin addict, too (not that he is one to judge her). \"See what?\" he asks, more mildly this time. \"You can't, but I can,\" she persists. \"I can see.\" This reminds him of an old movie he saw a long time ago. A movie about a kid who could see dead people. The kid looked a bit like Sean (don't think of that) and this is why he remembers it. \"I see things, so many, too many,\" she continues. \"But it's not enough. It never is. I need you to help me.\" Oh that's rich. He can't help laughing. How can he help anybody when he hasn't been able to help himself (or his son? Or his wife? But no, she never needed his help.) he is forty but feels as old as hills. An addict kicked off from the police force (thanks to the bloody gum-chewing kid whose name he can't remember), barely making enough to feed his addiction. A private eye in the kingdom of the blind. She finally turns her gaze on him. She looks at him with those fish-eyes of hers, lips pursed, hands folded in her lap. She looks at him and knows because her curse/gift is not only seeing murders whatever Dr Hineman might think. It was this gift or curse that told her to find this man, and it had never been wrong before. She is sure of that. She keeps track. Let him laugh. He doesn't laugh for long though. This X-ray stare is unnerving him. He suddenly feels uncomfortable and for the first time wonders why the hell she has chosen him. \"What do you want from me?\" he asks. And she tells him. She tells him about her nightmares. She tells him of murder and death and blood. She tells him about Dr Hineman and her experiments. And when she says that he will help her, he knows he will. But it takes him many months to ask if she has ever had a nightmare about a little boy in red shorts who disappeared from a public pool twelve years ago. RED BALL He still can't get his mind around that one. He knows he has been framed. But how? Why? By who? The how is a paradox. When did this thing start? With someone approaching Leo Crow, promising to pay him if he pretends he killed Sean? Could a mere intention trigger the chain of events that brought him here? And if it could then it certainly wasn't Danny Witwer who set him up. He doubts the little shit could come up with a plan like that. No, it had to be someone who was intimately familiar with the inner workings of Pre-Crime. Someone like himself. Or- He glances at Agatha, huddled in the front seat beside him. She is silent, practically catatonic. What shall he do with her? At some point the idea of returning her to the Temple started to feel wrong. He thinks Wally's devotion to her is somewhat disturbing. And keeping someone pumped full of drugs, between sleep and wakefulness, just so you could access the information they have is not OK. It completely slips his mind that less than two hours ago all he wanted was to use her head as a file: open/read/copy/close. Hell, in these clothes she looks practically human. Ridiculous - yes, crazy - yes, sick - yes, but still a person. He will never be able to forget her screaming, or her pleading, or the way she gripped his arm trying to stop him. She grips his arm now, and he is so startled that he nearly lets go of the wheel. What the fk? \"We have to hurry,\" she says. \"Drive.\" \"What?\" \"Just drive. I'll show you the way\". He is about to protest but changes his mind. His only option is to go to Lara's but maybe it would be better not to involve her. (Though he would like to see her one last time before they finally catch him.) Maybe it would be better to do as Agatha says. After all, she has never been wrong before. Or has she? This leads him to thinking about the minority reports again. And then he understands that only one person in the world could set him up. It just hits him, and his hands clench around the wheel. The pain of this betrayal is nothing compared to losing Sean, but it's new, it's fresh and it hurts. He is almost surprised at this. He thought nothing could hurt him anymore. The only thing he doesn't get is the reason. Why? It doesn't make any sense. He is thinking about it and following Agatha's instructions mechanically, so it is only when she tells him to stop the car that he understands they have come to his own apartment. \"Hurry!\" she tells him. \"There is no time.\" \"What? What is it?\" he asks. \"Murder,\" she shrieks. But he doesn't hear the spyders, or the voices and footsteps on the staircase. There is no hovercraft at the window. In fact, there is nothing at all. And he realizes why and knows it's his own fault. He took Agatha, and made it all happen. Is he supposed to kill someone here? Or stop someone being killed? Agatha gives him a push and he crashes through the door. Danny Witwer is staring at him with wide frightened eyes. Lamar slowly turns to see what the noise is. He has John's gun in his hand. \"This is the end,\" Anderton thinks. But it's not.

The TV screen was bright against the darkness of the room. This wentnunnoticed by the room's only occupant. It was 2 in the morning; she claspednin her hand a cup of coffee long gone cold. Her eyes had huge dark circlesnunder them from lack of sleep. She feared sleep more than death itself. She sipped the cold coffee and starred past the TV. Her mind wasnblank, just the way she wanted it. Really, it was not the sleep she feared,nit was what sleep brought. Dreams. She dreamed of nothing but death andnmurder when she slept. It doesn't take genius to figure out that this isn'tna good thing. She reached for the remote and turned off the TV. A figure raced down thenset of steps and into the room. The light suddenly went on. The girlnmoaned, setting her coffee down, trying to shield her eyes from the suddennbrightness. A boy about the age of 18 stood in the doorframe. He worenpajama pants with no shirt, revealing is well build lean torso. He had darknraven hair that went every which way on top of his head. He had brown eyes,nfilled with worry and concern. \"Kari!\" he yelled \"Are you drinking coffee?!\" \"Yes\" she admitted, looking down at the cup. She stood up as well. She too had raven hair, but it was noticeablynlighter than the boy's standing in front of her. She looked to be aboutnnine years old. Her pale complexion, skinny fragile body, along with thenhuge dark circles under her eyes made her look like a ghost. She looked asnif a gust of wind would snap her weak bones. She wore a white nightgown,nobviously too big for her tiny body. Her raven hair fell about her waist inna lifeless fashion as she walked over to the boy. \"You shouldn't be drinking coffee! Its bad for you!\" the boy scolded. \"So is everything else in the world\" Kari scoffed. \"You...you...shouldn't be out of bed...\" \"I couldn't sleep\" \"Or didn't want to\" \"Drop it Sean\" \"The doctors are trying Kari\" \"You call that trying?! They aren't trying to cure, or help me, let alonenthe other like me, they're trying to put is to use, the ones that survivenwill be sent off to the military to be used as tools\" \"Stop talking like that, you know it's not true\" \"You'd be thinking the same thing if mom had started doping when she wasnpregnant with you and not me...\" \"Your sickness is a rare and unheard of one, they said it has nevernhappened before and will probably never happen again, it's very unlikelynthat the same with would've happened to me...\" Kari said nothing. Her tiny hands clenched themselves into fists. She feltnthe tears coming and tried not to cry, but failed. The tears came with tinynlittle chokes and sobs following. Sean dropped to his knees and brought hisnsuffering little sister into his arms. She wrapped her arms around hisnshoulders and cried into the crook of his neck. \"Sean?\" Kari croaked after she was done crying. \"Yeah?\" He asked as he picked her up and began walking upstairs. \"When I die, will you cry for me?\" her eyes began to flutter open andnclosed as she asked this. The breath got caught in his throat. He knew from the time she was born tonabout the age of three when she started waking up in the middle of thennight screaming about murder that she would die before him. They had bothnbeen taken away from their mother at the ages of 2 and 10, so Sean hadnbasically raised Kari by himself. They had both been sent to an orphanagenand grown up there. Sean was too old to be adopted, seeing as peoplenadopting wanted little children, and no one wanted a child that woke upnscreaming every night. When Kari was 5, a doctor specializing in childrennapproached them and took Kari away to a children's hospital. Or so he said.nIn reality, it wasn't a children's hospital at all, it was a study lab. Sean didn't see Kari for 2 months, when he was finally able to, he was toldnthat there were children like Kari that they were trying to help. Seannhated the life his sister was leading. He knew very well that he would livenlonger than Kari, but he had no idea that she would become so bad at such anyoung age. \"Yes\" he choked \"But that wont be for a long time, Kari\" \"I love you, Sean...\" she whispered. \"I love you too, now shut up, you need rest, you have to go back to thenhospital tomorrow for more tests\" she nodded and finally closed her eyes. He walked into her room and laid her down on her bed. He tucked her in andnkissed her goodnight on her forehead. He knew she was coming to the end ofnher life, he just hoped she'd still be there in the morning. Kari dreamt of murder for the last time that night. Her raged breathingnslowed as the dream ended.

And so, with that innmind, and with the boredom of summer dulling my usually nimble andnproductive brain, I created this bit of chaos. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"Red ball, brown ball. Red ball, brown ball.\" Detective John Andertonnjuggled the spheres with the unerring grace of an epileptic hyena,noccassionally cracking them against an inauspiciously placed light fixture.n\"Red ball, brown ball--shit!\" The balls flew across the room and into thencarefully polished loafers of a certain scumbag and resident hottie. Detective Danny Witwer smiled. \"Hello Clarice.\" Anderton pouted. \"Gimme back my balls!\" \"No one can do that for you, John,\" Danny said sagely and retrieved thenlittle roly-poly items at his feet. \"Anne Lively? Did she die again?\" Anderton lifted his finger quite wisely and said, \"She didn't die, butnshe's not alive.\" Strange Enya-esque/tribal chant yelling sounded in thenbackground. \"Why the hell does that keep happening?\" Danny asked and placed the ballsnon the table. Agatha spasmed in the Temple below and cried, \"Can you see?\" \"What, sweetie?\" Danny yelled and smiled his arrogant, devilishly sexynsmile. Anderton turned his chair backward and sat astride it; \"I had sex with anpre-cog once.\" \"You were tall enough?\" He squeezed his fingers together. \"By that much.\" \"Impressive--gum?\" \"Is that why your teeth are so white and shiny?\" \"That and bi-weekly appointments to my dentist,\" he grinned and The Teethngleamed. In the fishbowl chamber beneath, Wally went insane. \"We've got incoming!\"nHe tore rabidly at his jacket and played with some shiny syringes. \"Is he on any medication?\" Anderton tucked his hand beneath his chin, \"We've suggested it, but therenare policies.\" \"Same problem in the NRA.\" \"We've got a red ball,\" Fletcher glided into the office to man thencomputer. \"Time?\" \"Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-three seconds.\" \"I'm gonna stir my coffee and look sexy for a while--see you in a bit.\"nDanny left the room. Chief Anderton took the crimson balls--blue was the color he mostnassociated with, alas--from the glorified bingo machine and set them in thenscrubber, popping in a disk of classical music that he didn't particularlynlike but was sure would fool \"the ladies\" into thinking he was deep andnprofound. \"The ladies,\" it turned out, much preferred an Irish lilt and anstreak of hereditary alcoholism As the images began to unfold themselves, Danny reentered. A shot of thenIrish countryside projected on the screen. \"I can see my house from here.\"nhe chuckled sexily to himself, popping another bit of gum into his mouth. Anderton did his best to ignore him, but it didn't change the fact he hadnreadily noticed his nemeses perfectly fashioned ass. \"All right,\" said thenchief, \"We've got one man, one woman--unclear faces at this point--angun.no, a knife.\" \"Big difference, pal.\" \"Shut up, Danny!\" said Anderton, \"Anyway--single homicide.

Fletcher had sat quietly while they bickered, but now he stood. \"It doesn'tnmatter what's within our jurisdiction--a human life is at risk!!!\" Danny raised a dark eyebrow, \"Flight time?\" Fletcher checked his monitor quickly, \"An hour and a half.\" \"Fuck that then; lost cause.\" Anderton threw the pre-cog balls into thenopportunely placed trashcan beside him. In it laid two or three dozen othernreject pre-visions. \"I have a complaint,\" Danny said quickly, \"this film has like no women--nthere's no one I can have sex with properly.\" \"You hit on my wife!\" Anderton growled. Danny piffled him away, \"She wishes.\" A catfight broke out for absolutely no explicable reason. \"You horny slime ball!\" \"You impotent midget!\" \"Loafer-wearer!\" \"Bad actor!\" \"Obscure actor!\" \"Ugly, weird-teethed Yankee scum!\" \"That hurts, man.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry.would you like some tea?\" \"Isn't that an English thing?\" \"How do you think we sober up?\" A knock resounded in the shiny metal palace--and Danny went straight awaynto get it.

It's not much - may develop into something more. Maybe not. Basically it's just something to fill the massive Minority Report shaped hole in fanfiction.net. (C'mon! It's an excellent film! Why is no one writing about it?!?) **** Precrime - it works! Fresh-faced children stare out of the walls at me. They make me feel claustrophobic. The walls have eyes - literally. They probably have no idea what they're talking about anyway. They only know what they're parents tell them, and they in turn are told by the leaders of this great, free country called America. We're supposed to be able to say whatever we want here. We're supposed to have the right to know what's going on in our own societies. The children smile little brain-washed smiles at me. They are the very picture of innocence and ignorance. I should have been like that, at their age. It occurs to me now, the irony of it all. Murder is no longer the sordid, unmentionable creature bred of the baseness of humanity. Of our darkest desires. It has been brought from behind closed doors, alley ways and dark nights, into the mouths of our children. The snow is falling lightly onto the streets. A little girl, no more than 5 or 6 squeals in delight. She opens her mouth to catch snowflakes on her tongue as her mother drags her through the busy streets. It snows a lot here now, but people still love it. It makes everyone feel like a child again. It reminds me of Precrime. People are eager to believe that the world can be bright and white when it snows. They don't remember what's underneath, under every flake that kisses the ground. The sidewalks are still there, just as black and filthy as they have ever been, probably stained with the blood from the epidemic of murders that swept the country over 6 years ago. They forget they're just the same sidewalks they've ever been. I should be the greatest advocate of Precrime. My Father, as an upstanding citizen, was called time and time again as witness when the detectives pieced together the images spat out of the Precog's minds. He wanted me to grow up without the fear of what people are capable of, and so he sat me on his knee, and I watched with him. I bore witness to crimes of passion and hatred, predetermined killings and violent arguments. I saw rape and death and everything in between, too scared to watch but too afraid to turn away. I was six years old. But it was then I knew that things could be different. I saw how much guesswork the detectives did, because there is a margin of error to everything. And if there's one thing I know about, it's humanity. My father made sure of that. But he showed me something he didn't intend for me to know - the unpredictability of life. The Precogs don't know all ends. I'm not doing this for glory. I'm not doing it for those innocents, haloed and shipped away to be conveniently forgotten for a crime they *might* have committed, had they been given the chance. I'm doing this for myself. For the little boy who lost his innocence and saw things that he should never have had to see. I was six years old for fucks sake! I'm doing this so that no one will ever have to see another broken, shattered image of a broken and shattered human being. I don't want to have to watch it anymore So I walk towards the Precrime offices, to the place I've been working for 2 months. I hate it there, but this is the only way I can prove the systems wrong, and that there must be another way. People will thank me. Because we all get tired of the snow, when it's slushing in yellowing puddles at the side of the road. We forget what we ever saw in it. **** Ta-da! What do you think? More? Probably not. I actually doubt anyone is even reading this, as no one seems to be interested in Minority Report on this site! If someone has, by chance, strayed upon this fic, please please review? Please?!?

He looked at the alarm clock and groaned. It was one o'clock in the morning. \"Stop wriggling, Donna.\" \"Donna's been having nightmares,\" Agatha told him. She didn't tell him the whole story. That would have to wait until the morning. ... When Donna had been sent to school, Arthur made a cup of tea and handed it to Agatha. \"About this dream,\" he said. \"It was more than an ordinary nightmare, wasn't it?\" \"There was a murder,\" Agatha nodded sadly.

A week later, Agatha was just about to get breakfast when the paper came. Donna picked it up, as usual, and brought it to her mother with a cry. \"What is it Donna?\" Agatha asked, pulling pancakes out of a packet. \"The man!\" Donna exclaimed. \"What? Did you know him?\" Agatha asked. \"He was in my dream,\" Donna started to sob. \"Go and get your father,\" Agatha said sharply. Donna stopped crying, dried her eyes and ran off. Agatha picked up the newspaper. \"Oh my god.\" she breathed. ... Dashiell didn't live very far away from them, so they didn't travel very far to get to his house. It was Dashiell's daughter, Anna, who answered the door. \"Daddeee!\" she yelled. \"Come in!\" Dashiell greeted them. \"Thank you,\" Arthur grinned. \"Dash, we need to talk,\" Agatha said. \"Did you see the thing in the paper today?\" Dash asked. \"About the murder.\" \"That's what we came to talk about,\" Art said. \"I got woken up by Donna, a week ago,\" Agatha said. \"She'd dreamt about a man being shot.\" \"I was ready to regard it as a nightmare,\" Art said. \"It was,\" Agatha said. \"But we'd both dreamt the same thing.\" \"Anna got that,\" Dash frowned. \"We'd woken up, and Anna climbed into out bed, claiming about nightmares.\" His wife clutched his hand. Samantha was a pretty girl, very shy, very quiet, but very friendly, with pre-cognitive powers. \"What are we going to do?\" she asked. \"Start up another Precrime?\" Dash suggested. \"No,\" Art said, through gritted teeth, giving his brother a small shake. \"I'm never going back to that pool. Did you ever see what Wally did to Agatha?\" \"He won't any more,\" Dash said. \"He can't.\" He picked up the newspaper next to him, and showed it to his twin. On the front there was picture of Wally Paige. He had been shot. ... Anna was staying with her aunt and uncle. Agatha got woken by Donna. She was white, and Anna was crying. Agatha hadn't really slept, and she could sense Arthur hadn't, either. She got up, pulled on her dressing gown. It was three o'clock. Agatha tried to comfort the girls. Finally, the colour returned to Donna's cheeks and Anna stop crying, and both girls went to sleep. Arthur rolled over as his wife got into bed. \"They OK?\" he asked sleepily. \"Yeah,\" Agatha said. \"Well done, babe,\" Arthur said. \"Get some sleep.\" Agatha nodded, shut her eyes, and immediately went straight to sleep. ... Agatha, Art, Anna and Donna met Dash and Samantha outside John Anderton's flat. \"It happened again,\" Agatha said simply, and Art knocked. \"Hello,\" John greeted them. \"How are you today?\" \"Tired,\" Anna said. John raised his eyebrows. \"They haven't had much sleep,\" Agatha explained. \"That's why we came to you.\" \"Why?\" John asked. \"They've inherited it ,\" Art said gravely. John stared at him. \"What?\" John's son Tom asked. \"What's wrong, daddy?\" \"Nothing,\" John said quickly. \"Why don't you run and get daddy's friends drinks.\" \"Yes daddy,\" Tom said. He ran off. \"So, they can see murders,\" John muttered.

It's her fault.\" \"My mother loved me!\" Agatha exclaimed. \"Yeah!\" Art said sarcastically. \"Enough to make you see murders every day of your life.\" \"Art, she do you realise she died because she loved her,\" John said. \"Oh, sorry,\" Art went a bit red. \"It's not you fault,\" Agatha said. They both grinned. Tom came back, carrying a tray of drinks. John quickly took the tray, before Tom let it tilt. The three children ran off to play, and three sets of grown-ups talked. \"John, we have a serious problem,\" Dash said. \"Please, sir, please,\" Samantha begged. \"Is there anything we can do for them?\" \"I don't think so,\" John frowned apologetically. ... A/N . The names might not make sense. Agatha and Arthur's daughter was called Donna. In the short story Minority Report that the film is based on, there were 3 precogs, 2 males and a female. The female was called Donna (so that's where I got HER name from). Anna was just random, and Samantha (Dashiell's wife) is the same name as Samantha Morton (the person that played Agatha.). John's son Tom might need a little explanation. TOM Cruise played JOHN Anderton, so I'm basically naming him after his father's actor. I still don't know where I'm gonna go with this, so suggestions might be helpful, thanks! And I know it is TERRIBLE!!! No need to tell me!!!

James couldn't even think about sleep. James just needed to marvel in this moment of just having made love to someone he truly cares about. Now, what happened this summer is the past and this is the new beginning. Em said that James was the only good thing that happened this summer but she couldn't have been more wrong in James' mind, she was the best thing to happen to him this summer. Seeing her every day in that god awful t-shirt with those green eyes he just wanted to stare into like a Venetian sunset. He couldn't believe he was actually here and she was too. He started to think about waiting for the one and he was glad he never gave into the ridiculous per pressure his college buddies always pushed him into. He knew that giving it to someone like Betsy Cook or Lisa P. would end up with a truly embarrassing story that would add to list of stories being passed down from future Adventureland employees. I mean their interlude did have some funny moments including him putting the condom on the wrong side and the kettle pot going off in the middle of foreplay. But that was them; they were a couple who were both so far from the social norm that their attraction to one another was obvious to the passing eye. As he lay there beside her he kept on playing over every moment that happened on this unforgettable night. The way she touched him with such consideration, she knew he was obviously nervous and really had no idea what to do. She led him know that everything would be fine and then he continued to kiss, with every kiss getting deeper and deeper. Em shook as their damp abdomens met setting James into a frenzy. James continued kissing her neck and lowered down to her supple breasts that were a milky white with a perfect pink nipple to match. He began to suck on her left using every muscle in his while also massaging her right. Em mouthed out moans of pure pleasure while she ran her hands through his curly wet hair. James was more than ready to fully consummate this relationship but he needed more time to savor, when he was finished with both breasts his lips trailed back up to her neck. Em found his lips again and couldn't wait any longer. \"James\" she murmured \" Do it now\" While James was ready to there was something he needed to say. His friends had always warned him that talking during sex was never a good idea, unless it was dirty. What James was about to say was far from that. \"Em\" he pantered while trying to lower his heart rate \"I want you to know that I came here because I'm in love with you and I needed you to know that\" Em's heart accelerated like she had just been hit with a shot of adrenaline. No man had ever said that to her before. Sure Conell said it once or twice but that was usually while he was achieving his orgasm and she was usually left unfulfilled. She couldn't define love any more after her mother died. But this guy who came into her life really made her think twice. She truly regretted what she did, not only because it was with a married man but because she truly hurt James. He was one of the only people to look into her eyes and tell her how beautiful she was without the phrase sounding like a line. He made her laugh, he loved the same music and he waited for her in the pouring rain. It might have not been love just yet, but it was getting close. \"Oh, James\" she replied kissing him back. She wanted to say it back but it just wasn't the right time. As they prolonged into even a deeper kiss James entered her slowly, surprising Em by the way he was so confident about it. He began to find his own rhythm as he entered her in and out. He couldn't keep his lips off her neck as they continued to make the sweetest love either of them had ever known. Em took a good old of James' thick, curly hair as they both began to reach their climaxes. Once they reached the point, James kissed every inch of Em's face and Em snuggled close by. James was amazed at what had just happened but couldn't fathom why Em didn't reply? Was she confused? Did she feel she needed to give me a favor because I was waiting for her in the soaking rain? What did I do wrong? He kept going over this while Em slept soundly. He lied there marveling in what was now his. He kept stroking her slightly damp hair. It didn't matter that she didn't say I love you now, she will say it later. As they lay soundly, a large crash of thunder hits their apartment and both of them stir. Em, still groggy murmurs \"What was that?\" \"Just some thunder, go back to sleep\" James said as he kissed her lips one more time. \"James\" Em said now a little more alert \"I'm sorry I didn't say I love you back..\" \"Why are you apologizing? James interrupted \"If that's not how you feel, it's okay. I wanted you to know because I wanted to tell you sooner but I was to scared. But after what just happened it confirmed that I'm truly in love with you Em and want to spend more time with you.\" \"No, James\" She said while James got a puzzled look on his face \"I was just afraid that you said I love you because it was the heat of the moment and that' what many men said when they have a naked woman underneath them.\" \"But I do love you too. You are one of the only people in the world I can be my true self with and what you did for me tonight was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me\" \"Really?\" \"Yes, I love you James Brennan\" \"I love you\" James said and found his way back to Em's lips and they began part two of the evening.[Chapter 2] James awoke to the sounds of the big city. He awoke alone and found a note on the bedside table. Had to go to class. Be back in a couple hours. Make yourself at Great, what was he to do now? Well she did say make yourself at home so he knew he had to wash off the smell of bus and rain so a shower would be a good idea. He went over to check his clothes and luckily most of them were dry because there was no way he was going to wear that ridiculous shirt. He hoped in the shower and was thankful Em didn't have lots of girly shampoos and conditioners. But he always remembered her having this distinct smell he finally knew that it came from her shampoo. He stood in the shower for an extra 10 minutes just basking in the scent that was em, it wasn't too long before an unexpected visitor arrived. He had jerked off so many times to Em in the shower but now it was different. Now, he can think back to last night when he was holding and caressing her. He know could think back to the moment when he finally had achieved what he wanted giving himself to as his friend said \"lonely,plain-looking,depressant who threw himself at him\" but she was none of those things she was Em. James got dressed and found some old oatmeal she had in her cupboards. He knew today he had to go find a job, granted he wasn't thrilled about the prospects but at least he was where he always belonged. James was about to leave when he realized he had no way of locking the door. He checked under the mat and thankfully she had one there. He didn't really remember was street he was on but this was a part of his adventure. He began down third street and walked past a few restaurants and shops, none were open at this time of day. Another block down he came across a bookstore. Pittsburgh never really a great eclectic shop where he could wander for hours, he was always hoping that there would be a place in New York for him to do that. As James got closer he saw a Help Wanted sign, James began to pray that this could be a possibility. He knows more about books than life so that should make him qualified. James walks in to the quirky shop called Hooks Books. The place was covered in 1950's science fiction posters and a few book covers. Something very calming flowed through James and he looked through the antique shelving and first edition books. He noticed an older gentleman at the counter and assumed he was the owner. James prepared himself and walked on over. The man was in his mid 50's, had long grey hair and was wearing an over sized sweater that would have made Mr. Rodgers proud. James made his way to the counter and the gentleman immediately pulled himself out of the book he was reading. \"Can I help you find something, sir?\" \"I saw your sign out front\" James Said as the gentleman looked awake with excitement. \"Oh yes, the position would be primarily back of the house, dealing with stock, shelving, a little bookkeeping and keeping things organized do you have experience with that?\" James always remembered to be honest and upfront when looking for a job he never really knew what a back of house position meant but he did enough hard labor this summer that he knew he could handle anything. \"No really but this past summer I worked at a theme park so i know how to handle lots of manual labor and I'm a really fast learner so I'm up for anything\" James said while trying to keep his smile more professional and less creepy. \"Well, fill out this application and I'll be right back.\" The man said and he handed James the clean piece of paper. James began filling out the basics and realized he had no address to put down. He remembered briefly what the address was to Columbia so he wrote that down. James filled out the basics as the man came back to the desk. \"Finished?\" \"Yeah.\" James said as he handed it over \"So, James you're attending Columbia?\" \"Yes, grad school actually\" \"Very Nice\" the man said as he was looking over the application. \"Well, the pay is not high but we do overtime.\" \"My schedule is actually quite flexible. I can work as much as you need me too.\" \"That's exactly what we need here. I'll start you this Wednesday at 10 am sharp . Pay is $6.50 an hour.\" James' face turned into a huge grin as the man offered his hand out. \"I'm Jeff, welcome aboard James\" \"Thank you thank you so much\" James said as he was about to jump over the counter and thank the man. Who knew it could be this easy to find a job in the biggest city in the world? James didn't want anything to be jinxed so he shook the man's hand and skipped his way out the door thrilled at the news he was gonna tell Em. James was walking back and felt really good. yeah, he wasn't at Columbia studying but he was in a place that was much better than where he was this summer. Em was right in saying that this summer was rough but she was the one good part of it and she deserved to be happy no matter what she had done in her past. James didn't know if he was a part of her future but he'll be around until she makes that decision.[Chapter 3] James came back around four after exploring the city even more. He hoped that his new work schedule would give him time to check out everything that the city has to offer. James had never really gotten a proper adventure in his life, he was hoping europe would be that but fate would have a different turn. Now, he was glad that his father had been demoted because if he didn't he would have never found Em. He entered the apartment that was smelling of home cooked pasta. Em was at the table studying in her book while that pasta was boiling on the stove. \"Hey\" Em said as he shut the door. He looked at Em as a way he had never seen her an intelligent woman who was here to make a better future for herself. \"Where have you been?\" She asked as he sat down next to her. \"I got a job\" James said as he reached out for her hand. Her face lit up \"Really? Where?\" \"That bookstore a few blocks away, I'm gonna be mostly doing inventory but it's something\" James explained as Em was still intrigued. \"Well\" she said as she got up and went to her cabinet \"This calls for a celebration\" she said as she pulled out a bottle of Jack Daniels. James smiled as she poured both of them a glass. \"I didn't think you to be a whiskey girl\" James commented as she filled her glass over halfway up. \"It was my grandpa's favorite he always had a glass every night after work but never more than one though, he didn't want to follow in the footsteps of the rest of the alchies in the fam\" Em told him as she handed James his freshly filled glass. \"Here's to you\" Em raised her glass \"Here's to us\" James said after click their glasses and downing a big shot. James jumped a little as the burning liquid went down his throat but Em downs hers like water. \"I feel bad\" James said as em's eyebrows crease \"I feel like I'm taking advantage of you\" James confessed while fidgeting with his hands \"I have three dollars to my name and here I am basically living in your place and I have absolutely nothing to give you back in return expect for the tiny paycheck I will get every other week\" Em smile while she made James sit back down. \"First off, I love you being here and you're welcome to stay as long as you want\" Em explained \"Secondly, I don't pay rent for this apartment either\" James looks questionably while Em poured another shot \"When my mom died, she not only left me and my dad a hefty life insurance policy but some old money she had inherited from my grandfather\" James was interested in why if she had all this money and was over 18 why she would always come back home? \"So, why don't you just live here full time instead of going back?\" \"My dad made a deal that I would have to come home every summer and 'make an effort' every summer or he would have the money taken away\" James was confused \"But the money was in your name, right?\" Em nodded and took another swig \"James, my dad's a lawyer he can find a way around it besides the only reason he wanted me home was so I can make more of an effort with Francie\" James nodded \"I take it you really didn't have a say when your father married her\" Em shook her head \" I made mine but he obviously didn't listen. I knew he was seeing her before my mom died and it disgusted me that he felt the need to be with her. I get that he was lonely but why her?\" Em questioned with frustration as tears were beginning to form and James moved in closer wrapping his arms around her shoulder. \"I mean as soon as she came in she started to judge me on everything from my clothes to changing my major\" James was curious \"What is your major by the way?\" \"English Literature, she thought it was a waste of time and said it's best for someone like me to study law since my dad is so respected in his field that it should be no problem for me to find a job.\" James was giddy with excitement inside because he knew there was something about her that connected them and it was she was just as much of a book nerd as she was but he most likely more. He hugged Em closer while kissing her forehead. Em began to wipe off her tears \"But who the fuck is she to judge? She hasn't done shit in her life. She just married whatever guy gave her the best house and membership to the local country club.\" James intervened \"I'm so sorry Em that you had to go through all that alone, you didn't deserve it\" \"That's what led to Connell\" James immediately tried to change the subject and held her closer \"We don't have to talk about it\" James whispered in her ear. \"No no please. You deserve an explanation.\" James tried to protest while Em raised her hand \"Please hear me out and then I won't mention it again\" James nodded while Em turned to face him splotchy face and all. \"One night after Francie and I had a huge argument I went down to the place where Connell was playing. I was just drowning my sorrows when Connell came over after his set and asked me what was wrong. We got talking and turns out he could really relate to my fucked up my life. I knew he was married and I knew that what we were doing was wrong but I just wanted to feel something with someone who understood how shitty my life was\" Em titled her head down while James tried to process the situation \"I wish I was there, to help you and save you from making that mistake\" James said as Em sobbed in his shoulder. After a few moments Em, looked up \"It's ok mistakes are meant to be there so we can learn from them. If only my mom was around, she would have been the person I could have talked to about it.\" \"You and your mom were close\" James wondered. \"She was my best friend, we talked about everything. She was the typical PTA mom but didn't try too hard just let me be me.\" Em looked away as she continued \"When she got sick, I couldn't handle seeing her like that. the doctors said it was still a good chance that she could make it, but it spread and just like that she was gone\" James could now understand why Em made all the mistakes she did. Em's mom left her life and without her consent another woman came in to stake claim on her life that she had already loved. \"Thank you for telling me Em. It means a lot\" James said as Em looked up and gave him a chaste kiss on the lips. Their romantic moment was interrupted by the sound of water boiled over. \"Shit\" Em exclaimed as she went over to the pasta and turned the burner on lower. \"Whatcha makin?\" He asked as he secretly gushed over Em's domestic skills. \"Just spaghetti and meatballs. I normally eat at the student center but I didn't want you to go hungry.\" Em said as she got out the jar of pasta sauce. \"I didn't know you could cook\" James commented as Em gave a slight laugh. \"I normally don't, my mom did most of the cooking growing up but she taught me some stuff along the way.\" \"My mom does most of the cooking at home time when my mom was out-of-town, my dad had to cook for us and he ended up putting the roast in on 500, the house was full of smoke in like 30 minutes\". She laughed as James shared his fun memory. Em always withheld so much from people because she was always afraid they would leave her but coming clean with James felt right and she knew he wasn't going anywhere soon. \"My dad was a pretty bad cook too. Em broke the silence. \"One time he tried to make thanksgiving dinner and the turkey was totally frozen on the inside and burnt to the crisp on the outside\" He laughed and relished in this blissful moment he was having with her just being open and free. It's moments like this he was glad he didn't give it up to some trashy girl who was just gonna forget his existence the next day. Em was something that he didn't mind waiting for sure she wasn't perfect but she's real. \"Since, I have a job now I can help out a little. I can get us some groceries\" He said as she was stirring the noodles. \"Like I said before, it's no worry you're welcome here as long as you want.\" Em said looking away. \"Please, just let me give something. I know that money is technically not an issue but humor me. I don't want to get by on a free ride just please let me give something back.\" James pleaded a she came over and wrapped his arms around her waist. \"Fine, you get the groceries and even pay for the laundry, if you please\" she said as she turned around and kissed James on the lips. Their kiss began to deepen as she dug her nails into the back of his scalp and his hips began to grind into the front of her jeans. Ever since last night all he wanted to do was continue exploring every inch of her body and see what kind of pleasure was still leerking in their newly reunited bliss. \"Easy, we've got plenty of time for that\" Em said as she went back to the stove. Viscous but perfect woman he thought as he went to the utensil drawer gather the settings for their meal. \"So, is this your final year?\" James asked as he gathered a bunch of mismatched table wear from the cabinet. \"Yeah, it's good to be done but I of course have no idea what I'm gonna do next\" Em said as she dashed some salt into the boiling water. James smiled at the idea of them living a crazy bohemian life in the big apple, knowing that it wouldn't turn out that way but it was cute to think of. \"My professor got me to apply for some summer internships with some publishing houses here and if all goes well it could lead to a job there\" Em commented as she saw James set the table with a bright blue plate and a white plate with ivy green design along the edge. \"That's awesome. Who know's you could help publish my book?\" \"You wrote a book\" \"No, the one I'm going to write once I travel all over the world\" James said in a adventuristic manor \"Oh, well should I start calling you Kerouac or Magellan?\" Em joked \"How about your boyfriend?\" James blurted out as he saw Em cheeks begin to flush and she turned right away. \"I guess that's true too\" Em gushed as she looked back over at James \"Em, I know you don't wanna move things fast but I can't help the way I feel and all I wanna do is be right here with you and see what happens\" James confessed as he went over to her and she stroked his cheek. \"Well, then consider you my new boyfriend\" em laughed as he kissed her longingly on the lips. James continued to set the table when Em made a suggestion, \"You know since you have a place of residency and a job you could go back to Columbia in the spring\" James was happy at her suggestion but knew that could not come true. \"That would be nice Em but I'll be getting like $60 every other week, it's not even going to come close to how much I need for their tuition\" James groaned at the reality of his so-called life. \"Apply for a grant, my one friend did and got enough money not only for college but to pay for half her place. There's a book she got fro the library. I'll grab it for you tomorrow see what you can do? See if they still want you in?\" Em offered in such a selfless manor. He was shocked that she was so helpful but he also remembered what she had said before that night in the car. Why did he have to go to grad school to become a travel essayist? Couldn't he just do that on his own time? Maybe he could find a grant that would support him exploring the world. He knew it would be a long shot but at least Em was on his side and that's all he needed. \"Yeah, I'll take a look and see what I can do\" James commented as he watched Em saunter around the kitchen in those cut off jeans that made her body look like another adventure he had to explore. \"Great\" Em said as she came over and kissed him on the lips. James' life had always been a bit of a bore and the only escape he could find was either through weed or a great book of poems. But know his life was nowhere near a bore and he never wanted to escape. ","Summary":" The rain continued all throughout the night. James couldn't even think about sleep.

All new characters are mine Eveybody runs...everybody runs. The alarm clock went off, and I opened my eyes slowly. The beeping noise was annoying. I always wondered why they hadn't invented something better to use as an alarm. I sat in bad, wiping the sweat from face. I felt weird, I couldn't understand it. I got up out of bed and walked towards the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I prefered to do it manually then have a machine do it. I walked out of my bathroom and stared at a newspaper article I had clipped on my wall. A picture of John Anderton. To me, he was my idol. He was the only person in Pre-Crime history to avoid getting captured until after the murder, a murder he never comitted. They had shut down Pre-Crime for about 5 years, until they found a new system. The original pre-congs, Arthur, Agatha, and Dashell had had babies, and they turned out to have pre-cong abilities like their parents. They were now used to see murders, even without their parents wishes. I turned on the television to see a commercial for Pre-Crime. A bunch of young children were talking and saying \"Pre-Crime, it works! I shut it off and walked out of my room. I would guess I would be a normal sixteen year old, except I don't like music. I walked downstairs to find my mother making breakfast. \"Good morning Jack sweetie.\" She said as she was cooking the bacon. \"Mom, do you have to call me that?' I replied. I had asked her before not to call me that. \"You know I do.\" Mom replied, in that annoying sing-song voice. I sighed and grabbed a plate and some coffee. my mom put eggs, bacon, and sausage on my plate and I sat down to eat. The one thing my mom could do well was cook. After I finished my breakfast, I headed outside. School was out today, thankfully. The sun was high, not a cloud in the sky. A light breeze was in the air, scattering leaves and dirt all around. I could hear birds chirping away high up in the trees. I cast a glance to a dark allyway and saw a couple guys who looked like they were on the most wanted list. If I had o take a guess, they were sneaking aroundm trying to go unseen. I stared at them, slightly puzzled, but I continued walking, trying not attract their attention. When I was half-way down the street, I got goosebumps. I turned around, and saw those guys I had seen in the allyway walk in to my home. Panicked, I ran towards the house, to try and do something. I knew they couldn't murder my mother, because the Pre-Crime unit would be here to stop them. I ran as fast as I could to my house. I finally reached my house, and crept in quietly. I looked around, and saw muddy footprints on ther tile leading towards the kitchen. I knew my dad kept a gun in his room if I could just get to it. I heard glass shatter in the kitchen, and winced as I heard it. I finally reached my parent room and crept inside. I looked under their bed and I found it. I handgun, with the clip in place. I took the safety off and loaded the bullet in the chamber. Now that I had a gun, I was determinded to get those creeps out of my house. I opened the door of the kitchen, and saw the men slitting my mother's throat. I couldn't believe it. Where the hell was Pre-Crime! They cut her throat with a piece of glass they had shattered earlier. I was in shock. I couldn't move. I stood on the spot, paralyzed in fear, but them I remembered the gun in my hand. \"Drop the glass asshole! I screamed. The guy looked up, and it was my father.[Chapter 2] Jack stared at his fathenrin complete horror. How could someone he loved this much donsomething this terrible...this unspeakable crime! I pointed the gunnat him. \"Get the hell out of here before I shoot you.\" Isnall I could manage to say. He looked at me and grinned, that stupidngrin of his. \"Son, you haven't got the guts, I know.\" Hisnpartner laughed, as did my father. \"How could yyou?\" Infought to hold back tears. \"Simple son. But I don't need to tellnyou.\" He said. My father walked toward me, and I got my strenghtnback. \"Take another step, I shoot.\" I said angrily. Thatnanger was turning into hot rage. My father shrugged and walked towardnme, piece of glass in hand. BOOM! A lone, single gunshot ran out. Mynfather looked at his chest in horror. \"Yyyou..sonnn..of...aaaa\"nHe slowly crumpled to the floor. I stood in shock at what I had justndone. My own father. I shot my father, but he did something that henneeded to be killed for. I looked into the face of the other guy. Inrecognized him. He worked with my dad at his lawyer's office. Henstill stared at my dad in disbelief, but then he looked at me, andnlunged. I was caught off guard and pulled down to the floor. Henknocked the gun out of my hand, but I punched him in his stupid face.nAfter I got him off me I reached out for the gun but he kicked mynarm. \"Ahhhh!\" I cried out in pain. Now I was furious.

Her words went through his heart like a bullet. His face raw and turning red into anger and sadness at the same time. He lifted himself off the couch and started stumbling towards her, leaving his beer bottles and cigarette butts behind. As he got closer to her she could smell the alcohol on his breath and the cigarette smoke on his clothes. \"And why would you want a divorce?\" he was right in her face, they're nose almost meeting. They stared at each other face to face each other's eye's cold and hard, motionless. She felt his anger and fear had stricken her body when she saw how drunk he was, his speech slurred his eye's weird, the way he stumbled, but she stood her ground. \"Because\" she replied slowly taking a slight step back, in case his reaction wasn't verbal, but physical towards her. \"I want a divorce because your never home anymore John, you love your work more then me ..... or Mary.\" she said while pointing to a photo of they're five year old daughter that hung proudly on the living room wall. She could tell he was outraged, his fingers tapping his thighs, his jaw tightened, his breathing getting deeper and faster every second. She took another small step back and continued. \" You're abusive and a drunk, you smoke more then six packs a day! I also know about Agatha John, I know that when you say you have to work late, you just really screw around with her.\" Her voice shook like she was about to start crying, it felt like a thousand bee's were tinging her eye's from all the tears welling up inside. But her face stayed strong. John Anderton chief of police stood there, he knew what she said was true, but he was not about to be made a fool of and give it up. \"I don't know what your talking about.\" He replied Cooley. \"YES YOU DO JOHN!\" She yelled almost sure that she had woken Mary up. \"I want you out of this house.\" She said, this time softer and lower, her eye's still stern and full of hate. \"And where do you expect me to go Laura?\" His oice sarcastic and doubtful. \"Go to Agatha's. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.\" She folded her arms ready for whatever he had to give her in reply. But instead he backed up, headed for the kitchen and out the door. She followed him up to the porch and watched him through the night stumble to his car, \"I'll be back for my stuff and Mary!\" He yelled to her, as he climbed in the passenger seat of his car and slammed the door. The car automatically went into drunk driver mode and a inflatable dummy popped into the drivers seat and the car started to drive away. \"He'll get Mary over my dead body.\" She mumbled turning and heading back into the house. She didn't expect John to give up that easy, but she was glad that he did before things really heated up. Her head was pounding now, she walked up the stairs, towards Mary's room, she peeked her head in to see Mary sleeping. Laura walked to her room and face planted onto her bed and started crying.[Chapter 2] Chaptern2 Morning Lauranwoke up the next morning, her eye's blurry she saw that it was tenno'clock am. She'dnfallen asleep late last night around two, an hour after John left. Shenlifted her head to look around the room, she'd fallen asleep ontop ofnher covers, with tissues in hand wet from her tears. Lauranmade her way to the bathroom in her room to clean her face. Shennoticed the dark circles and red puffyness around her eye's, shenbrushed ehr teeth, washed her face and headed down stairs to see ifnMary was up. Luaranwalked into the kitchen to see her daughter sitting at the tablencoloring and eating cereal. \"Morningnmommy.\" Her voice chipper and sweet as usual. \"Indrewed you a picture.\" A five years old typical speech wasndeeper then most in Mary. She brought it over for her mom to see thennran back and sat down on her chair. Thenpicture was of a puppy, a puppy which Mary had been wanting for anvery long time. Lauranknew what her daughter was up to, so she hung it up on the fridge. \"Thatnis a beautiful horse Mary.\" \"It'snnot a HORSE!\" she exclaimed. Lauransmiled \"Oh I see... it's a cow.\" \"MOM!\"nshe was now cracking into a smile catching onto what her mom wasndoing. \"Cannwe please get a puppy PLEASE!\" She pleaded \"Nonwe can not get a puppy Mary not now.\" Marynwas about to make a rebutle, but Laura spoke before she could let thenwords out. \"Whyndon't we go to the park today? It's beautiful outside.\" Hernvoice in a sort of whisper, staring out the window at teh sun shiningnthrough the tall tree's. \"OK!\"nMary said exited, now forgetting about the puppy argument. \"Okngo get dressed.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 The park was a ten minute walk from their home, so they just walked there. Mary brought her bouncy ball to play with and Laura brought a book. While walking through the park on the paths they made they're way to the pond. The pond was big and deep in the middle, the water was like crystaals in the sun. Laura made her way over to the bench shaded by the tall willow tree's, she opened to the page that was bookmarked and started reading while Mary bounched her ball on the docks. Mary watched as the colorful ball went up toward the ky into the sun then came back down and went up again. when she threw it up again and bounced back down, out of nowhere a puppy came and stole the ball from her. \"Hey! Give that back it's mine!\" she shouted at the puppy, who just bent over into a playful position and wagged his tail. Mary took a step forward, and in a flash the puppy was at the end of the docks,a dn stopped waiting for Mary's next move. \"Mommy, he won't give my ball back!\" Laura looked up from her book. \"Mary! don't go near that dog he could be dangerous!\" she yelled, Laura leaped up and raced for Mary and swooped her up in her arms and tried to shoo the dog away. \"Go on get out of here, Shoo Shoo!\" The puppy just rolled over onto his back exposing his tummy, ball still in mouth. \"Look at him with my ball, it's dis-dis- it 's yucky!\" Mary said while trying to pronounce the word disgusting. \"SCAMP! SCAMP! come here\" A man yelled, Laura, Mary and the puppy looked towards where the voice was coming from. The puppy immediately got up and ran over to his master. Laura froze, she couldn't believe her eye's. The man took the ball from the puppy's mouth and started to walk over to them. \"Sorry about that, puppies you know?\" his voice soft and deep. He handed the ball back to Mary. \"Here's your ball, sorry about the slober.\" Mary took a quick glance at the ball, then back to the man. \"He can have it!\" she said disgusted, looking at the puppy role on the grass and chase his tail. Laura was still speechless \"You... your.. Danny?\" \"How do you know my name?\" the man replied puzzled. \"Your dead, I mean your supposed to be.... Lamar... the bullet.... how?\" Her confusion made her words stumble. \"Do I know you?\" the man replied still having no clue of what is going on. Laura set Mary down. \" Go play for a minute Mary.\" \"If you think I am playing with that dog you are crazy\" she said with her arms crossed. \"Just go and play for a minute Mary\" Laura said sternly not taking her eye's off the man. \"FINE! come on mutt, and give me my ball back!\" she said walking off the puppy following her. Lura walked over to the bench and Danny followed. \"your Danny Witwer.\" she said \"yes I am, and you are?\" \"You don't remember me? I'm Laura Johns wife\" \"John? John who? I have no idea what your talking about!\" He said more confused now. \"John Anderton! HOW THE HELL ARE YOU ALIVE DANNY!\" she was yelling now more annoyed and confused. Danny remained silent for a minute. \"Lamar shot you in the head, he killed you.\" \"Yes he did, but they operated on me took the bullet out, and did some other things.\" \"Do you remember anything? that day what happened? do you remember when you came to my house? John Andeton, Pre Crime?\" \"I don't remember the day Lamar shot me, I've only been told, I don't remember anything about my past life, my likes dislikes, girlfriends, family, job. They said the bullet hit the memory part of my brain, and now I can't remember anything from my past.\" Laura was listening to him explain everything. Something was different about him. He wasn't that asshole that came to her door asking about Sean and John. He seemed... more sincere. Her daze was broke by Mary. \"Hey mister, what's your dogs name again?\" Danny turned his attention away from Laura to Mary. \"His name is Scamp.\" \"How old is he?\" \"He is now 4 months old.\" \"Can I keep him?\" she asked Danny wide eyed \"Mary!\" Laura scolded \"He's not your puppy, and I already said earlier you can't have one.\" Danny just smiled. \"AWWW Come On!, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!\" Mary was now on her knees begging. \"I said no now get up off your knees\" At that moment the puppy jumped up on Laura. \"Scamp get down!\" Danny pulled the puppy off Laura. \"Maybe we should take him for a walk to tire him out.\" Laura said hopeful of no more jump attacks. \"Good idea\" Danny agreed \"YES, can i walk him?!\" Mary said anxiously \"Sure\" Danny handed the leash to her. Mary and Scamp walked ahead of Danny and Laura. They were talking about the current things in Danny's life, and even though he didn't remember her Danny felt a strange sense, that there was something between them. \"Where do you do, now that you aren't a detective anymore?\" \"I do multiple things, I work at the vet clinic, doing stuff around there, I fix old cars, and I train thoroughbred horses.\" \"Impressive.... where do you live?\" \" Out in the country, four hours away from the city.\" \"Why are you back in the city then?\" \"Doctors appointment, and I wanted to visit my mom and sisters.\" \"how long are you staying?\" \"Maybe a week.\" There conversation of 20 questions was cut off when Mary saw the ice cream vendor. \"MOMMY! IT'S ICE CREAM MAN!\" she yelled at the top of her lungs with joy, then took off with Scamp towards the ice cream truck. \"Mary, you can't get an ice cream, I didn't bring any money.\" Mary is devastated and looks like she's about to cry. \"I'll pay\" Danny says as he pulls out his wallet. \"No it's fine Danny, you don't have to\" \" I want to\" Danny remarked Lauras heat fluttered, he has changed she thougth to herself. He wasn't the stuck up guy in a suit like she remembered, now he's the nice guy, who just wears jeans and a shirt. And how fine he looked in those jeans too. He train of thought was cut off when Danny asked her what kind of ice cream she wanted, then she noticed he had already bought Mary her chocolate ice cream. \"Vanilla, please\" \"one vanilla, one chocolate vanilla twist please.\" Danny gave the man the money and they were off again. \"Thanks for the ice cream Danny\" Mary said with chocolate all over her face and Scamp eager to lick it all off. \"Yes thank you Danny\" Laura replied \"Your more then welcome\" He answered smiling, his beautiful smile. As they were walking down the park paths, it started to rain. \"Oh gosh, we better go home now\" Laura said looking up at the dark clouds moving in. \"Yea me too\" Danny replied looking up as well \"Where do you live?\" Mary asked Danny \"My apartment building is about an hour walk from here.\" \"Why don't you come home with us we live right over there!\" Mary said excitedly. \"That's ok, I don't mind the rain.\" \"Please can you come to our house!\" Mary said grabbing Danny's hand. \"Mommy can he plaease come home with us, PLEASE\" Laura thought about it for a bit, what about John, what if he came home and saw Danny Witwer in his house. Although Laura doubted John was coming home anytime soon, he was probably at the bar boozing it up. \"Yes\" the answer just popped out of Lauras mouth before she could stop it.

Shifting with difficulty in what she had deduced was a simple school desk, bound with duct tape, she ached unbearably and her jeans were becoming plastered to her thighs. Blinking her eyes hard and straining their lids as far open as they would go, she extended her neck until she heard a crack and felt sharp pain shoot along tendons that were uncomfortably close to her spine. Though it startled her, she continued to stare desperately ahead, attempting to bore past the darkness of the indistinguishable room through sheer willpower. \"Now, now, Clare, you don't need me to tell you that's not going to work.\" The voice was amused, as it often was. A slight, purposeful, patronizing amusement. Neal was reminded of someone who knew the ending of a book responding to the plot speculations of one who did not. This thought, and the implications it had for herself, extracted from her a self-deprecating semblance of a chuckle—not really a laugh, but a sort of exhalation of resign, an audible embodiment of sarcasm. The response to her outburst was prompt. \"Oh?\" Clare could think of nothing more foreboding than the perfectly executed cartoonish cheeriness of that one syllable. \"What's that? Something funny?\" For the hundredth time in the past several minutes, Clare darted her rapidly distending gaze about the room. She knew there was no point to it—if her eyes hadn't adjusted yet, there was no light which could have allowed it. And, if no light had been allowed in, the voice did not want her to see where she was. If there was something she had learned in the short period of their acquaintance, it was that when the voice didn't want something to happen, it did not happen. Vice versa, as well—which is why she knew that putting off responding to the voice was just as effective as all of the staring she was doing. \"I asked you a question , Clare.\" There it was. Might as well get this over with , she thought. She cleared her throat, an action which somehow sent another mirthless laugh rasping involuntarily out of her. \"It's just, I'm starting to see the—\" she coughed—\"bigger picture.\" Clearing her throat again, a bit more violently, Clare kept her gaze fixed on where she approximated her knees to be as she spoke. She would have looked in the direction of the voice, regardless of being able to see anything—who knows, maybe the sick fuck could see her —but said voice never seemed to come from just one direction. It emanated from the air itself, taking on its own living quality, cornering her, immobilizing her better than painful layers of duct tape. It was effused from something, everything, and yet from itself. It was an entity unbound by laws of any kind, even those of simple, steadfast physics. The voice took its turn to laugh, but this one was neither hoarse nor helpless; it was even, strong, all-encompassing—an impossible fusion of unhinged and calculated. This laugh knew what she was thinking . \"Good, good! You know, you're doing well, Clarabelle. I'm impressed.\" Clare was frozen to her seat. Was she imagining things, or did the voice sound closer? It couldn't be closer . It was already all around her, coating her skin. Eating her alive. Hysteria was threatening to collapse her chest cavity, rend her skull, send cracks through reality, carve rioting terror stories in her arteries and let the leaking ink drown her. The laugh came again. \"No need to go so tense.\" Noticing everything. \"I don't bite.\" Hell, there was no mistake: it— he she finally had to admit as her stomach and all succedent anatomy constricted—had sidled up to her without a hint, like the satanic apparition he was. She could feel the softest stirring of breath across her face—or was it the back of her neck? Her ear? It was still impossible to tell. \" Usually .\" O A/N— This goddamn fandom needs more goddamn people! I want to do a multichap fic for it so badly, but no one's gonna read it!

No, not a joke. Nope I'm not going to say April Fools! At the end. This stupid holiday, though it isn't a real holiday I just like to feel special as I call it stupid, is the day that I was born. The phone was silent. Not even a single call all day had come through. A girl named Avery stared at it and waited. She had been dropping hints for the past week about stupid little things. Like 'Did you know that Hollywood Undead releases a new CD on April first?' or 'Only ten more hours until I'm twenty!' and many others of the ilk. Yet it seemed that no one got the hint. Her best friend had remembered the diner for tonight together and canceled because her boyfriend wanted to treat her. And her brother had left around three in the morning and hadn't returned since. Then those people that she had considered friend never gave notice, even on Facebook. But Avery had hope. That was proved as she squatted right in front of the phone, most weight on her left foot because the right was still currently broken and healing, and waited for it to ring. Even if only one person gave her a call to day just to say 'Happy Birthday Avery' she would be happy. Hell even if they called to ask a favor of her as long as they said those three simple words before quickly hanging up and not waiting for a response she would be happy. The phone stayed silent though. Every had this new number, she had told them from the phone booth right on the corner every time she called. And still it was silent. A quick look to the time told her that if she wanted to do anything to celebrate, even eat out or get fucking chinese food to bring home, she would have to leave soon. Just then the door bell rang and Avery jumped to her feet, albeit clumsily because of her injury, and rushed to the door. Some one was here! Her birthday may not be a fail after all! Avery threw the door open and immediately her face fell. A man dressing in a UPS uniform was there. He held out a pad and she signed. Then he handed her a manila envelope and Avery ripped the top off, the Lost Boys book she had ordered had arrived. She turned to leave and enter her apartment once more. \"Wait, there's one more thing.\" He handed her a square case. It was wrapped in newspaper and the bow looked like a first grader made it. But she became all hyper and cheery again. Someone remembered, though there was nothing to indicate who. Avery flung her arms around the UPS mans neck and hugged him. His hat fell and she let go. \"Thank you.\" She said and a stray tear fell from her eye. The man was handsome to say in the least. His blond hair was short and combed back and his glasses made him seem all the more cute a small blush covered his naturally tanned cheeks. He just nodded grabbed his hat and walked off. Avery sat down on the couch and just tossed her book aside, for now it was the least important thing. She removed the wrapping paper and low and behold there was the CD she wanted. Hollywood Undead 'American Tragody' sat in her ands and she checked for a name, anything to let her knew who had sent it. But the funny thing was that there was nothing on it. No Name, no note, nothing but a sticky not with a time on it. 9:00pm it read. A look at her clock told her that in ten minutes it would be that time. And she blinked. \"UPS delivers this late?\" She asked allowed to herself. Then shook her head. She would wait for the time and see what happens. .~:*:~. Across the street in the apartment parallel to Avery's the man in the UPS uniform stood and watched the girl through the scope of his assault rifle. She kept glancing at the time. He smirked and looked behind him. \"Thanks.\" He said and the man nodded. Then guestutred to the clothes. \"Of course.\" The man stripped and handed the close over to the real UPS man. The man took the uniform and left while the sniper looked at the clock. \"Perfect.\" He again said. To some he was know as The Caller while to others he was Kiefer. And to Avery he would try to become Love . He had been listening in on a phone booth again, old habits died hard, and he heard her. At first he thought nothing of it but then a week past as here he was seeing what she was doing for her birthday. Nothing. Not even a friendly call came through. So he did the only thing he could. Took the CD from a 'gangster' kid, got his UPS friend to get the book and lend him a uniform. Then he had taken a news paper and did what he could. After that it was all up to fate and fate had decided to favor him today. Avery had not only accepted the unknown package but had in her happiness hugged him. And now she waited for his call. It was now nine on the dot. He put his ear piece in, dialled the number and waited while looking through his scope. Avery literally flew at the phone and picked it up by the first ring. \"Hello?\" Her voice spoke to him through the connection. But he forgot what he had been about to say and kept quiet. Like most people she would hang up now. \"You sent me the CD, didn't you?\" Again he kept quiet. \"Well, thank you.\" \"Happy Birthday, Avery.\" He hung up. Without knowing what else to say he had to. But she didn't and through his implanted listening device under her side table he heard her speak. \"I'll wait again tomorrow at this time.\" Then she too hung up and he smirked triumphantly before packing up his tuff and leaving the building.

Unheard for eight years and still unmistakable. Still able to freeze Stu in the middle of a crowded New York street. Still able to set him breaking out in a cold sweat as his eyes darted from high window to high window. They'd said the Caller might not be gone…said it might not be over…but he'd hoped…prayed… Knuckles turning white on his cell Stu forced out a reply. \"What do you want?\" The voice tutted slowly at the other end of the line. \"That isn't very nice Stu. After all we've been through together and you can't even ask me how I am?\" Stu gritted his teeth, setting his jaw. Every muscle in his body tensed, straining to break into a run. \"How are you?\" He had been taught to obey, with blood, sweat and tears. That sort of thing never washes off. \"Can't really complain,\" the voice replied nonchalantly. \"I missed you Stu,\" glee tinged with sadistic humour. \"Shame I can't say the same,\" Stu snapped back and the voice chuckled. \"Honesty suits you Stu…\" \"What do you want?\" he demanded again, interrupting. Flashes of feelings connected to before were resurfacing. The pain, the blood, the shock. A sick feeling had settled over his stomach and ill-suppressed fear clawed at his throat. \"Just a little check-up,\" the smooth voice purred, \"to make sure you're staying in shape.\" \"That's really very touching,\" came the sarcastic reply, \"but you really shouldn't have bothered.\" \"It appears that way doesn't it,\" the Caller cooed, \"but check-ups do you good Stu, keep you healthy…\" Someone bumped into the frozen man standing in the middle of the side-walk, swore at him and kept on going. Stu barely noticed. His eyes were on the windows above, afraid to move. \"You can keep walking Stu. You are in the way and people are beginning to get annoyed…\" \"If I can keep walking then what's stopping me from hanging up?\" snapped the response through a dry mouth. \"Stu,\" the voice warned, \"you really don't want to annoy me.\" Shaking fingers held the phone against his ear as Stu started walking again, short distracted steps. Fearful obedience rattling around inside. \"So, you are doing good Stu? No other motels?\" Fury burned hot in Stu's head. \"No,\" the only syllable he could choke through a closed throat with any civility. \"That's good Stu, very good, I'm impressed at how well you're doing.\" The breathed praise, laced with sadistic delight, made him sick. \"You are by far my favourite.\" Possessive pride. Stu wanted to sit down before his legs collapsed. \"And how is your daughter?\" A stab of pure fear, feet halted, blood rushing in his ears, darkness edging his vision. \"Stu? You still with me?\" A chuckle. \"You didn't think that I wouldn't know about her, did you?\" He was going to faint in a crowded street. Stu leaned heavily against a wall and hung his head, breathing deeply. \"She is very beautiful, looks just like Kelly. She'll be a heart-breaker when she's older.\" From somewhere the strength came back. His head cleared and he was able to stand again. The fury was cold and hard. \"If you so much as touch her…\" he snarled. \"You know threats won't work against me Stu.\" Stu's fists clenched convulsively. \"Don't – you – dare – touch - her,\" he repeated. There was a long silence from the other end of the line. \"That's precious. As it is I have no cause to threaten your beloved daughter. So long as you keep on the way you are. Right Stu?\" \"Right,\" he snarled in a cracked voice. \"Excellent, well then, I shall say goodbye to you Stu. So pleased that we could have this little chat. You can expect another check-up at some point in the future. Bye Stu.\" The phone went dead. Stu continued to stare at it for several seconds. He realised that his shirt was stuck to his back and he was still shaking. Slowly he dialled home and held his breath until a familiar voice answered. \"Kelly,\" he expelled his breath in a rush, \"I'm coming home now. Is Amy with you? She's safe? Good. Don't let her out of your sight.\" Hanging up Stu walked home as quickly as he could. The Caller smiled to himself and flipped over the photos of Stu, Kelly and Amy like they were Tarot cards. He imagined him racing home to check they were safe. The Caller nodded, satisfied and pushed them to one side as he reached again for the phone. ","Summary":" Health check \"Hi Stu…\" That voice!

He'd never been able to get away from acting, but he never could show his face in public anymore. He worked behind the scenes. On a playwright team, no less. Putting his lies to good use, he always said ruefully. But he used a penname. He was afraid, terrified, of having his name out there anymore. But the cost of that was not having the money to pay the damn bills. He put down the pen. \"What is it?\" \"We got this in the mail.\" He took it from her and read it.

If he could survive hisngreat aunt, he could surely survive this. \"Now see here, kid. I'm not one of your friends. I am here to do business;nI'm not here to talk about movies, acne, girlfriends, or any other thingsnthat haven't left your mouth yet. I am simply here to torture you into mynsick little mind game, that's all. Now, do you understand?\" Silence. \"Hello? Do you understand?\" Still no response. Not wanting to call it quits, the man kept yelling intonthe phone until he heard any sign of life. Soon enough, there was a growl. Not the sign he expected. \"Ooh man,\" The young man's voiced slured.\"Aww, my stomach. So hungry..\" \"Hey! Did you even LISTEN to what I said!?\" Sheepishly, the boy responded to the now fed up arsenal. \"Umm, yeah.\" Thenboy's stomach growled. Then he continued. \"Something about businesses &nmovies about girls with acne who are tortured in some mind game\" \"WHAT!?\" \"Oh man, they must be talking about Monopoly. That game is screwy.\" And that was the last he could take. Now it was time to let rage take over. \"I mean\", the boy continued, \"how could they let a dog own a home? Theynmust've been on some heavy sh-.\" \"SHUT UP! I have HAD IT! Now it?s time for ME to TALK, ALRIGHT!?\" To provenhis seriousness, he began to shoot the street below. Not much his style,nbut it was the only way to get through to the kid. The boy was more concerned about his appetite than the madness outside thenbooth. \"Oh man. Your still working night shifts at that Pizza place, right?\" \"HEY! Didn?t you see?\" \"Oh, can I order?\" \"Dammit, LISTEN!\" \"I'll have a medium with extra cheese?\" Then the man decided; if he wanted this to work, he'd have to play hisnlittle game. \"Ok, ok\" the man continued. \"LOOK! Now If I make you some pizza, will younPLEASE shut up for a while so I can continue?\" \"Really.\" The boy hid a sly smile that would've been so clear to see, ifnthere was no fog. \"If I order, will you make it with ANY toping I ask for?\" The predator sighed, knowing this wasn't the smartest thing he should havendone. \"Yes.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes..\" \"Are you sure??\" \"YES! Now hurry up and give me your order!\" \"Alrighty then\" The boy then crackled his knuckles. \"I want a medium sized,nextra cheese pizza, with extra cheddar!\" \"Uh huh\". The man began writing it down in his notebook. \"Yes, and with mayo, some eggs &..\" \"Boiled or scrambled?\" \"Sunny side up if you can. Right, then I'd like some pepperoni &, uh,nmushrooms, extra peppery. And finally, some of them gummy bears, just tonadd some color.\" \"Will that be all?\" \"Yup. So what's the cost?\" \"Ooh, I don't know. Umm, $12.15?\" \"Aww, common man, cut me some sla-..\" \"Alright, alright. Um, $6.50.\" \"Now THAT?s more like it.\" \"Alright.\" The man wiped the sweat off his forehead. \"Now remember ourndeal.\" The boy yawned in response. 'Yeah, & remember. It's delivery, so I'm notnmovin' 'till it comes. Ok dude?\" The man just sighed in response, then hung up. He knew he was being used,nbut just didn't want to admit it. Then, he fled to do what was asked. The young man then waited, struggling to keep his saggy eyes from closing.nIn the end, his eyelids won. He slid down, hugged his knees & fell right tonsleep. Light crept over the horizon & brushed the dark streets to reveal whatnoccurred during the night; Bullet shells & everything. Streams of lightnstruggled to get through the fogged up booth where the boy slept, but onenmanaged to pass & touched the boy's right eye. He winced, then fully opennhis eyes to see the orange mixed sky. He looked over his Spider Man watchnto see that it was 6:45a.m. He then got up & stretched. The night had passed, so now it was time fornour hero to head back to his mom's basement, which he called home. \"Well, there went HIS tip.\" The young man whispered. With one last yawn, henthen began his long walk home. You might say he had, vanished. A few seconds later, a man in a black coat came carrying a Pizza box,nrushing to where the booth was. When he noticed that the booth was empty,nhe made a quite swear then kicked the phone booth. He then threw the pizzanto the ground and marched off. He pulled out a notebook and began to write, \"Note: Pizza first.\" The end... ","Summary":" Disclaimer thingy: I don't own 'Phone Booth'. I don't even have the DVD.

MinoritynReport2 janvier 2003 PART ONEnnI. Future Crime Fighters \"Youncannot fight this alone,\" Agatha, the female Pre-cog, told JohnnAnderton, a former chief Pre-cop. Agatha, a nearly bald, slimnfigure of a late teen, shivered in Anderton's arms, despite beingnclothed in a warm, dark-gray fleece coat and a pair of jeans. Agathantried to ignore her inside screaming from the \"murder\" Andertonnhad unknowingly committed. The constant flashbacks of the murderninside Agatha's head provoked Agatha into a state of semi-consciousnmoaning and whimpering. Agatha, clutchingnAnderton's dark coat, continued, \"You need the help of three pastncrime fighters and the alliance of someone, who, in due time, will nonlonger be with us.\" Anderton, the mediumnheight, short, dark haired man-on-the-run, stared questionably atnAgatha shivering in his arms. A question of Agatha's motivesnnagged in Anderton's mind, but so far, Anderton remembered, Agathanhad never proved false and her word was always truthful, correct, andncreditable. Thus, Anderton put aside his questions and simplynagreed, \"Alright.\" Anderton asked, \"Who do I call upon?\" II. Kim Possible I'm your basicnaverage girl And I'm here to saventhe world You can't stop men'cause I'm Kim Pos-si-ble There is nothing Incan't do When danger calls justnknow that I am on my way!

He says that it is imperative that we help!\" \"Helping a Pre-copnout of a dilemma in Washington D.C. on a school night,\" Kimnthought. She thought for a quick second before giving a smile andnreplying in a perky voice, \"No problem!\" \"Good,\" Wadennodded with a smile. \"Anderton will be waiting for you outside thenNorton Hotel on Ebbey Street.\" \"Wade, just onenquestion before we get into logistics,\" Kim stated, gently cuttingnoff Wade. \"Sure, what is itnK.P.?\" \"What's anPre-cop?\" Kim inquired earnestly. \"Hold on,\" Wadensaid, typing into his computer, \"I was just asking myself thatnquestion when I called you.\" Wade pounded a couple keys on thenkeyboard, remarking, \"Accessing future police activity departmentninformation.\" A couple seconds and a couple clicks later, Wadenannounced, \"Ah, here it is. Pre-crime is the latest development inncrime prevention. It has been running for the past six years as annexperiment in the Washington D.C. area. Chief John Anderton headsnthis elite Pre-crime unit that helps find evidence to find andnconvict future murderers.\" \"So I take it thatnthe Pre-cops are the cops of the future who track down these futurenmurderers,\" Kim stated in a questioning tone. \"That's correct,\"nWade nodded. He then said, \"Kim, you should probably get goingnbefore it gets too late.\" \"Good thinking,nWade,\" Kim smiled. Kim started to close her cell phone when shensuddenly felt the impulse to ask, \"So, what's the odd part ofnthis request?\" \"You have to go tonthe year two-thousand fifty-four,\" Wade replied. \"That's thenodd part about it.\" \"Okay, that changesnthings,\" Kim remarked with a frown. Then she brightened as shenthought, \"Well, I'm taking Ron and Rufus along, so it can't benall that bad! I will definitely need their help to battle thisnfuture evil.\" \"Good call, Kim,\"nWade nodded. \"Call me if you need anything.\" \"Sure thing,\" Kimnsmiled, adding a nod. Wade told hernsincerely, \"Kim, good luck and be careful!\" \"Don't worry; younknow me!\" Kim replied. Closing her cellnphone, Kim heard Ron's familiar voice calling to her. \"Hey Kim!\" Ronnexclaimed, coming over to his slender, redhead friend. Ron, a sortnof geeky, blond-haired teenager roughly Kim's age, (whom had a petnnaked mole rat named Rufus) came out to Kim. Ron and Rufus were anninseparable duo that constantly thought about food (mainly cheesenburritos and nachos) but through their seemingly lack ofnintelligence, Ron and Rufus retained a heart of gold that alwaysnseemed to pull Kim through her hard times. Ron asked, ignoringnhis pink rodent friend crawling up to the right shoulder of his rednsports jersey shirt, \"Need the help of Ron Stoppable and thenunconquerable Rufus?\" \"Oh Ron,\" Kimnlaughed, \"Of course I need your guys' help! Since when have Innot needed your help?\" Ronnand Rufus thought about Kim's question, unsure how to respond tonit. Kim glanced around her, wondering out loud, \"I wonder hownwe're getting to the future? I've never traveled through timenbefore!\" Just then, a phonenfrom a red phone booth began ringing. Ron gave a smile as he thoughtnabout the phone booth being the time traveling machine. Excitedly,nRon pointed at the phone booth while Rufus began hopping up and down.n Ron squeaked, \"I bet it's the phone booth that's going to benthe time traveling machine!\" \"Ron,\" Kim sighed,nheading to the phone booth. Taking a look at the ringing phone, Kimnpicked up the phone, looked at Ron in the phone booth with her, andnsighed, \"A phone booth is no sort of…\" The phone booth doornclosed, trapping the three inside. Then, a great cracking sound wasnheard above as a giant blue bubble began forming from the top of thenbooth. The shell fell around the red phone booth. Little sparks ofnelectricity began forming inside of the bubble; the sparks hit thensides of the phone booth, causing no harm to the occupants inside. nThen, in a quick second, the phone booth vanished, leaving nothingnbehind in its spot, not even a burn mark. III. ManynMeetings…The Plan Anderton sat nervouslynin the lobby of the hotel room that he and Agatha were hiding in. nEven though Anderton was still in shock from the realization of a setnup and the \"murder\" in which several dozen people thought hencommitted, Anderton tried to maintain a sense of calmness to notnfrighten Agatha. Anderton knew that it had been rough for Agatha tonsee the \"murder\" happen, just as she predicted. But had notntaken place in the entire manner that she foresaw. But, murder wasnalways traumatizing to those who witnessed the act, and this was whynAgatha was still shivering. Tucking the blanketntighter around Agatha and gently rubbing her shoulders, Andertonnquietly asked, \"Agatha, tell me, who is the fourth person that younspoke of? You said that 'later he will perish'.\" \"Yes, he will die,\"nAgatha nodded, her eyes still wide with fear and horror. Agathancontinued in her dark, melancholic voice, \"But his future can benchanged with your help. Can you see?\" Agatha lifted a weary handnand pointed outside. Anderton looked tonwhere the Pre-cog was pointing. A red phone booth had appeared justnoutside the doorway to the hotel. The few people in the premisesnleapt out of the way while others simply shrugged and continued onntheir way. \"The phone booth,nthey've arrived,\" Agatha stated. Anderton rose,nbringing Agatha to a standing position. Shifting Agatha's weightnso the Pre-cog would simply lean against his shoulder, Anderton begannwalking towards the red phone booth. As Anderton and Agatha nearednthe phone booth, Anderton heard Kim gasping to Ron: \"….time travelingndevice.\" Kim and Ron curiouslynpeer through the windows and gawk at the bustling metropolis. Then,nKim spotted Anderton and Agatha standing next to the phone booth. nGiving a relieved smile, happy in the knowledge that the timentraveling proved a success, Kim exited the phone booth with Ron rightnbehind her. Anderton gave thenlate-teen female a friendly smile and greeted, \"I am John Andertonnand this is Agatha. I've been told that your services would comenin handy for what I have to go through; that's why you've beennsummoned here.\" \"We're glad tonhelp,\" Kim smiled. She offered her hand to Anderton andnintroduced, \"I am Kim Possible and this is my best friend, RonnStoppable.\" Ron chirped in,nadding his own humor, \"When there's danger or trouble we'renhere on the double!\" Kim gave a soft laugh,nshrugging Ron off. Turning back to Anderton, Kim asked, \"So,nwhat's the sitch?\" \"I'm being set upnfor murder,\" Anderton stated. \"Actually, to tell you the truth,nI was supposed to commit murder, but then I decided that I canncontrol my future and so I didn't. But, the guy, (Leo Crow) wasnhis name, told me that if I didn't kill him, his family wasn'tngoing to be taken care of and he wound up turning my gun upon himselfnand shooting himself. He fell through the window and fell severalnstories to his death.\" Ron remarked, notingnthe semi-chaotic sprenzy around the hotel, \"No wonder there's sonmuch police activity around here.\" Kim asked, ignoringnRon, \"So how come you're still here? I mean, wouldn't thenpolice, err…the Pre-cops have seen you sitting in the hotel lobby?\" \"Yes,\" Andertonnnodded, \"But I had my retinas changed so that way I couldn't benidentified. Plus, Agatha has warned me ahead of time when to hide,nlook away, or pick up an object so that way I wouldn't bendetected.\" Ron inquired, lookingnslightly bewildered, \"You had your retinas changed?\" Andertonnnodded. Ron's mouth dropped open as he questionably asked, \"Doesnthat mean you actually had your eyes taken out?\" Again, Andertonngave a slow nod. Ron shook his head, putting his hands up,nexclaiming, \"This future place is so incredibly weird!\" Anderton growlednlightly, \"Well, having your eyes taken out and given new onesnwasn't exactly the most pleasant thing in the world you know.\" \"We're getting offnthe subject,\" Kim cut in. Giving Ron a light glare, Kim said,n\"Ron, we need to help Mr. Anderton solve who has been setting himnup. We're not here to discuss the future!\" \"Right as alwaysnK.P!\" Ron exclaimed with a smile. Turning her attentionnback to Anderton and Agatha, Kim asked, \"Do you have any idea whonmight be setting you up?\" \"I don't have annidea,\" Anderton replied lowly. He hissed, \"I know who setnme up.\" Kim and Ron waitednpatiently for Anderton to continue. Anderton, seeing his raptnaudience's stare, continued, \"I believe that Agent Danny Witwernfrom the Federal Bureau of Investigation has framed me.\" \"Are there anynmotives?\" Kim questioned earnestly. \"Witwer was sentnhere to oversee what went on in the Pre-crime department. ThenFederal Bureau, in reality, sent Witwer to find a flaw in the systemnin order to prevent the Pre-crime experiment from going national.\" Anderton took a breathnbefore continuing, \"Witwer had told me that there was always a flawnand that flaw was always human.\" Ron stated, agreeingnwith Anderton, \"That definitely sounds like a set-up to me!\" Kim assumed, speakingnout her thoughts slowly, \"So, what you're saying is that Witwernwas simply snooping around in order to find a way to make somethingngo wrong. And then, upon creating the human-flaw, report it back tonhis superiors and have the experiment shut down?\" \"That's what itnappears to be,\" Anderton stated with a sigh. After a lengthynperiod of thoughtful silence, Anderton questioned in the form of anstatement, \"From what Agatha had told me, there's supposed to bena third member to your party.\" Kim thought about thisnfor a bit, wondering whom Anderton was referring to. But Ron simplynlaughed and stated with a smile, \"Oh, you mean my main man, Rufus!\" Reaching into hisnpocket, Ron pulled out a pink, naked mole rat. The creature namednRufus had been soundly sleeping in Ron's pocket but now, Rufus wasnawake. Rufus gave an enormous, mole-rat yawn and wiped the sleep outnof his eyes. Giving the mole rat annincredulous frown, Anderton began questioning Agatha's reasoningnfor having a naked mole rat fit into the scheme of saving the day. nAnderton looked to Agatha, hoping to find assurance in the Pre-cog'snnervous state. Agatha, clutchingnAnderton's shoulder and breathing heavily as she stared vacantlyninto the distance, murmured, \"We're wasting time. The Pre-copsnare on their way.\" Agatha then went silent for a brief bit. nAllowing her words to sink in to the quad. Agatha then continued innher quiet, dim voice, \"He's back at the Pre-crime Lab, snoopingnaround. He's watching, waiting…he knows his next moves yet henhesitates because he knows the consequences of his actions. Butnstill, he's willing to do whatever it takes to keep doing his job. nThe killing, the murders, it will continue because I'm not there. nAnd because I'm not there, no one will know about the murder thatnhe will commit.\" Kim questioned,nraising an eyebrow at the trembling Pre-cog, \"Who is she referringntoo?\" \"Witwer,\" Andertonngrowled darkly. \"I knew he was just waiting for me to make anmistake!\" Anderton gave a frustrated sigh. Kim, noticing thenurgency of the situation, stated, \"Ron and I will head back to thenPre-crime lab and check things out.\" Anderton gave a slight nod. nAnderton was still deep in thought, trying to figure the set-up out. nKim continued, \"I wouldn't worry too heavily Mr. Anderton; wenwill get to the bottom of this.\" Looking up at Kim withna slight, relieved smile, Anderton said, \"Thank you, Kim, Ron. Inreally appreciate it.\" \"Sides,\" Ronnchirped in. \"While we're interrogating this 'Mr. Witwer', youncan still be doing your own research knowing that we're kind ofn'stalling' Witwer.\" \"Good thinking Ron,\"nKim smiled, patting her friend on the back. Anderton stated,nthinking, \"Well, since it seems as though you guys will keep Witwernoff my back, I will be able to get out of the area with Agatha andncontinue my pursuit in the Anne Lively Case.\" Kim raised an eyebrownat the mentioning of the case. Kim inquired, \"What's that casenabout?\" \"It's the visionnAgatha saw and pointed out to me,\" Anderton quickly replied. nSpeaking in a lower voice, Anderton continued, \"I believe thatnthere's a connection between this case, and my being framed.\" \"Sounds plausible,\"nKim agreed. She thought for a quick bit before saying, \"I'llnmake sure that I ask Mr. Witwer about that when we go and meet him.\" Just then, Agathanbegan shaking as she cried quietly, \"Can you see, can you see…wenmust get out of here! They are coming and they will see you!\" Anderton shot Kim anlook of importance. Kim nodded and said, \"I'll give you a shoutnif we find anything.\" \"And I'll call younguys if I need anything or come up with any new developments,\"nAnderton replied. Taking Agatha to his red Lexus, Anderton placednthe Pre-cog in the comfortable, cushy, gray seat, and buckled Agathanin. Closing the door, Anderton returned to Kim and Ron. Andertonnthanked them in a quiet voice, \"I just want to thank you KimnPossible, Ron Stoppable, and you, Rufus,\" Rufus gave a small,nexcited squeak. Anderton continued, \"for helping me in thisnsituation. I really appreciate it.\" \"No big,\" Kimnsmiled. As Anderton went to the driver's side of his vehicle, Kimnturned to Ron and asked, \"Ready to go Ron?\" \"I'm all setnK.P.,\" Ron announced. He glanced to his shoulder and asked hisnnaked mole rat friend, \"What about you Rufus? Are you all set?\" \"Food…\" Rufusnreplied with a longing, sad look twinkling in his eyes. \"Is that all younguys think about is food?\" Kim inquired, trying to be stern whilenholding back her laughter. Kim knew that even though Ron and Rufusnusually preferred the inactivity of the usual day, the inseparablenduo could always be relied on to follow Kim to the very end of anynmission they ever underwent. \"So,\" Ron inquiredninquisitively, \"Who is this Danny Witwer that we're all after?\" \"I'm not sure,\"nKim replied with a frown. Pulling out her cell phone, Kim smiled,n\"But I bet I know someone who does!\" Kim quickly dialed annumber in the phone. Seconds later, Kim was asking, \"Hey Wade, donyou know any information about a Danny Witwer?\" \"Not off hand, but Incan check,\" came Wade's reply. There was a moment where Wade wasntyping in his computer, searching for background information. Wadenbegan repeating in a steady rate the information he saw, \"DannynBrian Witwer…age thirty two, born on the thirty-first of January,ntwo-thousand twenty-two. Father and mother, deceased…fathernmurdered, mother died of heart failure. Witwer is an only child…bornnin the Christian faith…\" Kim sighednimpatiently, \"I'm glad you can find all his \"readily available\"ninformation Wade, really, I am glad, but can you find any informationnthat would be useful about his work in the Federal Bureau ofnInvestigation?\" \"Not really,\" Wadenreplied in a disappointed voice. \"All access to the sites has beennblocked. It seems as if the future government gained total privacynwhile the public lost almost all of their privacy.\" Wade continuedntyping. Stopping, Wade shook his head sadly and replied forlornly,n\"I'm sorry Kim. There's just no way to access any of his worknfiles.\" \"It's okay Wade,\"nKim told him with an encouraging smile. \"You've done your bestnand that's all I can ever ask for.\" \"Thanks K.P.,\"nWade smiled. \"I wish I could be of more help but, for what it'snworth, good luck!\" \"Thanks,\" Kimnreplied. Then she closed her cell phone, looked to Ron, and said,n\"Alright, now for finding Mr. Witwer and asking him the questionsnourselves.\" \"Right behind yanK.P.,\" Ron replied enthusiastically, adding a positive smile. IV. Danny Witwer…thenConfrontation An auburn hair, plumpnwoman dressed in dusky attire walked steadily into the Prep-crimenlab. This was Anderton's secretary, Mrs. Fosk. The pleasant,nserious woman with broad-rimmed glasses hanging lowly on her nosenmarched over to Danny Witwer, the newly imposed \"Chief Commander\"nover the situation. Comingnto an abrupt halt in front of the suited, unshaven man, Mrs. Fosknannounced with a slight hint of annoyance in her voice, \"Mr.nWitwer, your girlfriend, Trisha Goodwin is here.\" Witwer,na philanthropic (at heart) but a sarcastic, snot-nosed agent sentnfrom the Federal Bureau of Investigation, turned his weary brown eyesntowards the secretary and gave the elderly woman a casual smile. nLike Mrs. Fosk, Witwer also wore a pair of glasses. But Witwer'snglasses fit snuggly on the bridge of his nose and unlike Mrs. Fosk's,nWitwer's glasses defined a certain degree of intelligence the youngnagent retained. Inna sudden perk of interest, Witwer replied quickly, \"Yes, send hernin right away Mrs. Fosk.\" \"I'llnsend her straight in then, Mr. Witwer,\" Mrs. Fosk replied in ansnappy tone of voice. Without a further word, Mrs. Fosk turnednabruptly from Witwer and marched out the door, slamming the doorn\"accidentally on purposely\" shut behind her. Witwerngave a small sniff of amusement before turning back to the screen henhad previously been viewing. The news of Leo Crow's death hadnreached Witwer's ears but the news had not yet taken its fullnaffect upon the agent. Instead of taking action, like the rest ofnthe Pre-crime officers trying track down the whereabouts of JohnnAnderton (the supposed \"murderer\"), Witwer had become interestednin the case that Anderton had reopened, the Anne Lively Case. But,nso far, Witwer was confused about why the case had been so importantnto Anderton. Justnthen, the glass door opened and a spunky, slender female with fullngolden wavy hair that seemed to make her face radiate with energy andnjoy, entered the room. The woman, slightly younger than Witwer, hadnthe poise of a ballet dancer as she gracefully crossed the room innelegant strides. Her attire reflected a sense of charm butnrefinement from the common revealing look. The woman wore a white,nspaghetti-stringed tang-top and a light yellow skirt. The integrity,nthe composure, and the beatific personality reflected the innernconfidence that had attracted Witwer to the woman in the first place.n This charming woman was Witwer's beloved girlfriend, TrishanGoodwin. Comingnto a graceful stop, Trisha smiled lovingly at her boyfriend andngreeted in a voice full of energy, \"Hi Danny!\" Witwernreturned Trisha's smile and greeted warmly, \"Trisha, I am sonhappy to see you!\" Trisha gave a small laugh. Witwer gave ancontented sigh as he continued, \"Well, it has been kind of roughnhere, trying to work with the Pre-cops.\" Witwer paused as henstared into Trisha's deep blue eyes. Witwer whispered, \"I'venbeen missing your sweet voice, tender touch, and your soothing soul. nI hate that I have to be away for so long and I hate that I have tonwork so late. And with this new case…\" Trishanput a finger over Witwer's lips, silencing his rambling. Giving anknowing smile through an amused chuckle, Trisha responded in a quietnvoice, \"I understand completely.\" Trisha gave Witwer a smallnpeck on the lips before continuing, \"That's why I came to seenyou.\" \"Younknow, you're really not supposed to be up here,\" Witwer told hernin a stern, but contented voice. \"Inknow, I know,\" Trisha replied softly, still smiling. \"But Inmissed being with you and my heart lead me here before my mind couldnstop me. Then my heart had my feet convinced to continue walking thendistance here and finally, both my heart and feet convinced my handsnthat they should open the door, and come in. It was finally my heartnthat moved my lips to speak to you.\" \"Well,nI am greatly moved,\" Witwer smiled, giving a slight chuckle. nWitwer then gave Trisha an affectionate kiss on the lips that lastednfor a moderate, romantic tempus. Then, as he pulled away slightly,nWitwer whispered, \"I love you, Trisha. I love you so much.\" Again,nWitwer gave Trisha a lengthy, tender kiss on the lips, taking in eachnfond moment that he spent with her. The week that Witwer had beennabsent from Trisha's life had felt like an eternity. The purgatorynin which Witwer suffered through left an empty feeling each nightnthat only seemed deafened by the onslaught of recent work. But now,nfor the few precious minutes that the two were together, the momentnwas theirs and they wouldn't let anything separate them. Whennthe two pulled apart slightly, Trisha noticed the familiar look ofnquestion in Witwer's eyes. Catching on to the look, Trisha asked,n\"You look like you want to ask me something, Danny.\" GivingnWitwer a knowing smile, Trisha continued, \"I can see it in yourneyes.\" Witwernblinked in surprise. He already knew that his girlfriend had annuncanny sense for knowing his every move, but to actually read hisnmind, that seemed not so far-fetched as Witwer had previouslynthought. Giving a small chuckle with a broad grin, Witwer saidnnothing. Instead,nWitwer reflected on when he had first met Trisha a year and a halfnago in Central Park. Witwer had been cent to the Big Apple for anshort, weekend vacation to clear his mind before returning back tonthe Bureau. While traveling through Central Park, Witwer hadnstumbled upon Trisha submerged in her latest book, \"TreasurenIsland\" by Robert Luis Stevenson. Afternengaging in a delightful conversation with the woman that lastednuntil well after dinner, Witwer knew that the two were meant for onenanother. Then, when Witwer had to return back to Washington D.C., henhad asked Trisha if she wanted to come with him, to which Trishanreadily accepted the offer. And so thus the two remained togethernthrough the year and in a half passionate relationship. Witwerncould only smile back at Trisha, afraid to really speak his mind. Trishanread through his thoughts and stated, \"Well, there's no time likenthe present. So, speak your peace before your lust for an answerndies.\" Witwerngave a soft chuckle, \"Well, my passion for you will never die.\" nTrisha gave Witwer a loving smile. Witwer then gently grippednTrisha's hands and led her to a chair next to Anderton's desk. Takingnthe seat, Trisha expectantly looked up at her boyfriend. Stillnholding her hands, Witwer kneeled in front of Trisha. Gazing intonTrisha's eyes, Witwer began, \"Trisha, will you come live with menin my home, forever, and reside within my heart for always?\" nTaking an even deeper breath, Witwer pushed forward, \"Trisha, willnyou come be my wife?\" \"Yes!\"nTrisha cried, breaking into joyful tears. She gave Witwer a lovingnsmile and then gratefully accepted his tender kiss. Justnthen, the voice of Kim Possible's sincere voice broke the silence,n\"I really hate to put a temporary end to this romance, but we havena job to do.\" Startled,nWitwer and Trisha quickly looked in the direction of the redheadednteenage, superhero. Witwer asked in a serious, demanding tone, \"Whatnare you doing up here?\" Witwer gestured at the door, thinking thatnKim and Ron were a part of the usual tour group that toured the innernparts of the Pre-crime department. Witwer stated, \"This isn'tnpart of the tour kids. Now can you please leave? I need to finishnmy investigation.\" \"Well,nthat's why I'm here,\" Kim smiled. Witwer gave the teenage girlnan incredulous look, not believing a word Kim said. Kim continued,nfully aware of the doubt in Witwer's mind, \"I was sent here tonfind out what you have against the Pre-crime department and also whynyou are so bent on finding a flaw in the system.\" Witwernstared at Kim in surprise. A thought of Lamar Burgess, the directornof the Pre-crime experiment, had sent the two teenagers to help innfinding John Anderton as well as Agatha, the Pre-cog. But then, asnWitwer continued to ponder the idea of added help, another thoughtncrossed the agent's mind. Witwer began to test another thoughtnthat had crossed his mind. Perhaps, Witwer thought, Kim Possible andnRon Stoppable were here as yet another scheme in Anderton's game atneluding the Pre-cops. This idea, Witwer knew, was quite feasible,nsince Kim had stated that she was sent to the lab to find out what henhad against the Pre-crime experiment. Witwernstated lowly in the form of a question, \"It was Anderton who sentnyou, wasn't it?\" Sayingnnothing, Kim simply arched an eyebrow and smiled knowingly at thendumbfounded agent. Meanwhile,nRon looked back and forth between Witwer and Kim. Ron was beginningnto wonder if Kim was trying to play mind games with Witwer, and ifnthat was the case, it would be forever until he was able to getnsomething to eat! Ron gave an exasperated sigh and asked, \"We'rennot going to play twenty questions now are we, Kim?\" Kimnrolled her eyes and shook her head slightly. Witwer simply becamenmore confused at the matter at hand. Witwer glanced at Trishanstanding next to him and gave her a gentle smile, whispering,n\"Trisha, sweetie, can you please give us a couple minutes?\" nTurning to give Kim a look of doubt, Witwer continued, \"I thinknthis is all just a big misunderstanding.\" \"Alright,\"nTrisha agreed, walking towards the door. She felt Witwer take a holdnof her right hand and give it a loving squeeze. Trisha looked to hernfiancée and gave him a loving smile. Pausingnat the door, Witwer told Trisha softly, \"You can come back a littlenlater. Don't let Mrs. Fosk stop you. You are more than welcome upnhere.\" Trishangave a soft laugh, smirking, \"What? Let that tart stop me fromncoming up here to see you, I don't think so.\" Giving Witwer anquick kiss on the lips, Trisha smiled sadly at her lover and quietlynsaid, \"I miss you already.\" Then Trisha left the room, givingnWitwer one last wistful glance before leaving. Whennthe door closed, Witwer turned to Kim and gave her an agitated glare.n Averting his eyes to look upon the screen, Witwer marched haughtilynpast Kim towards the screen. Stopping in front of the screen, Witwernstared at the screen, as if to ask his questions and get answers. nThen, moments later, Witwer turned to face Kim and gave the teenagerna hard glare. Witwernhissed, \"Trisha's the greatest girl in the world. It was almostnas if we were meant to be together from the very beginning.\" nWitwer paused, scoffing, \"Precious moments ruined by you two.\" Ronnput in earnestly, \"Hey, it looked as though you two were having a great time! Don't let us ruin that for you!\" Ron gavena huge smile, continuing, \"You know what they always say, 'don'tnlet anyone rain on your parade'.\" \"Shutnup,\" Witwer hissed lowly, his eyes radiating in a tint of immensenannoyance. Kimntried to intervene; worrying that if Witwer was as deceitful asnAnderton had earlier stated that he was, Ron and Kim's safety wasnat stake. So, to try to break up the tension, Kim began speakingndirectly about the information she had uncovered to Witwer. Kimncame in between Ron and Witwer. Looking directly at Witwer, Kim gotnstraight to the point; \"It is believed that you are trying to framenChief John Anderton by manipulating the system to make it look likenAnderton murdered Leo Crow.\" Witwer'snglare deepened as he growled lowly, \"Would you make that assumptionnwithout any sound proof?\" Witwer gave a hollow laugh, \"And whatndo you think I have against Anderton?\" \"Wellnactually,\" Kim stated, side-stepping Witwer's question, \"Itnisn't a question of 'what do you have against Anderton', it isnmore like, why are you trying to shut down the Pre-crimenexperiment.\" Witwerngave a small chuckle, looking down at Anderton's desk. Then,nglancing up at a non-amused Kim, Witwer laughed, \"Good use ofnreasoning Kim Possible. Perhaps some day you should work in thenFederal Bureau of Investigation.\" Kimncontinued, picking up confidence in her accusations, \"I was toldnthat Pre-cogs never make a mistake when identifying a future murder. nBut, the system can be manipulated to make it seem as though a crimenwas about to be committed, when in reality, all the murder is, is anploy, an artifice to an ever grander plot.\" Witwerngave another laugh, putting his hands up on his hips. Witwernquestioned through chuckles, \"A plot to what, Kim?\" Kim had nonanswer. Witwer gave a nod and scoffed, continuing, \"Kim, Andertonnalready committed the murder. Leo Crow's dead because of thisnPre-cop that you're trying to protect.\" Pausing,nWitwer thought about his statement and then, another thought camenacross the agent's mind. Witwer stated coolly, \"I know thatnLamar Burgess is protecting Anderton as well.\" Witwer gave Kim ancool smile and began stating in an accusing manner, \"And I alsonknow that you, Kim Possible, are now aiding this fugitive. You, Ron,nand Lamar are all in it together, trying to protect Anderton. So,nindeed, there is a greater scheme going on here.\" \"Howncan you say that we're in a grander scheme?\" Kim demanded,nfeeling her anger rising. Quickly taking a check on her resentment,nKim continued in a more collected manner, \"Yes, we want to protectnand help Anderton, because we know he's innocent.\" \"Cannyou be sure of that?\" Witwer demanded through a sneer. \"Well,nthat's for us to discern,\" Kim replied confidently. She gavenWitwer a small glare. Shakingnhis head, Witwer started towards the door, saying, \"Fine, you cannhelp Anderton in his game of 'cat and mouse' but rest assure, KimnPossible,\" Witwer breathed heavily, coming to a halt in front ofnKim. \"That when we find Anderton, he is going away for a very longntime and I suggest that if you wish to continue breathing the fresh,nopen air of America, then you should quit bugging me and wasting myntime!\" Atnthat, Witwer tried to get around Kim, but the quick female steppednright into his path, declaring, \"Not so fast Mr. Witwer.\" Givingnhim a steely glare, Kim continued, \"You're not going anywherenuntil we can figure this out.\" GivingnKim a deeper glare of annoyance than he already had, Witwer growled,n\"I'm sorry Kim, I cannot simply stand by, twiddling my thumbsnwhile a murderer is on the loose.\" Witwer gave a sigh ofnannoyance, throwing Ron an agitated glare. Witwer continued, \"Itnis clear to me, that you and your partner, Ron, are acting as decoysnto throw off the investigation.\" Smirking, Witwer stated, \"Well,nI'm not buying it.\" Then,nWitwer tried again to get around Kim, but this time, the quick femalenstepped in front of Witwer, kicked the door shut, and stated, \"Indon't think so, Witwer!\" Behindnher, Ron locked the door. Witwernthen went to Anderton's desk to pick up an obscure looking object. nHis face shone a deep annoyance in Kim and Ron's defiance. Witwernhated how that Anderton had hired a couple of children to slow theninvestigation. Witwer knew that he had to escape the two, and thisnwas his only option. Kim,nseeing Witwer head for the desk, quickly leaped onto a rolling chairnthat was next to her. The force of her body hitting the chair sentnthe chair (and Kim) rolling in a hurried manner. Kim (on the chair)nhit Witwer just as the agent was turning around. Both Kim and Witwernfell to the ground but it was Kim who recovered first. Kimngrabbed the object that Witwer had been reaching after. The objectnwas a slender, silver, cylinder. The top part of the object wasnslightly larger than the rest of the object and it rotated on a threenhundred and sixty degree axis. Kim figured that the object was somensort of weapon, and so upon grabbing it from Witwer, Kim pointed thenweapon at the agent. \"I told you thatnyou're not going anywhere,\" Kim stated firmly. Not knowing whether ornnot Kim actually knew how to use the stun gun but not really wantingnto take a chance of finding out, Witwer surrendered, putting hisnhands in the air. He gave Kim a steady glare. \"Take a seat andndon't move,\" Kim stated firmly, directing Witwer into Anderton'sndesk chair. From there, Ron (uponnfinding some rope) tied Witwer's hands and legs to the chair. WhennRon finished, he dusted off his hands and proudly smiled at Kim. Kimngave Ron a slight nod, lowering the weapon. Just then there camenthe musical beeping from the Kimmunicater. Plucking her phone fromnher pocket, Kim answered the phone in a perky voice, \"Kim here.\" \"Kim, it'snAnderton,\" the voice stated. \"What's up?\" Kimnasked, still using her energetic voice. \"I think I foundnsome evidence that will help prove my innocence but I need the advicenand opinion of someone else,\" Anderton stated. \"Agatha said thatnI needed to get your opinion.\" \"No prob,\" Kimnsmiled. \"We have Witwer under control so you don't have to worrynabout him for the present.\" \"That's comfortingnto hear,\" Anderton replied in a hurried tone. His voice soundedndistracted, as if his mind was somewhere else. Kim continued, \"Ronnand Rufus will stay here at the Pre-crime lab with Witwer and when Inreturn I'll interrogate him.\" Anderton nodded innagreement, \"Alright, sounds good. I'll tell you when you'renout of the building where to meet me. I don't want Witwer to knownwhere I'm at.\" Witwer gave a softnchuckle. He had heard Anderton's comment. \"I'll be out in anjiffy,\" Kim stated, closing her Kimmunicater. Turning to Ron, Kimntold him, \"While I'm gone, I need you to stay here and watch overnMr. Witwer. I'll be back shortly.\" \"But how come I havento stay here?\" Ron whined. \"Isn't my opinion worthy of notice?\" \"Yes, Ron, you'renopinion is extremely trustworthy,\" Kim replied, giving Ron ancomforting smile. \"But Anderton asked for me to come and so I neednto go.\" \"You always get tongo places while I get stuck watching over the criminals,\" Ronngrumbled. He gave Witwer a small smile, adding, \"Not that you'rena criminal or anything…\" \"Please Ron,\" Kimnpleaded, bringing up her lower lip and making it quiver. To deepennthe effect, Kim made her eyes slightly water. Ron saw the expressionnKim was making; it was heart-wrenching. Covering his eyes with hisnarms, Ron wailed, \"Oh, not the puppy-dog pout!\" Then, loweringnhis arms, Ron gave a sigh and stated, \"Fine, I'll stay here.\" \"You're the best,\"nKim smiled, walking past Ron. Stopping at the door, Kim stated, \"WhennI come back, I'll bring you, Rufus, and Mr. Witwer some lunch.\" \"Cheese burritosnwith nachos?\" Ron inquired hopefully. Kim, giving a smallnlaugh, nodded, \"Yes, if that's what you wish.\" Giving Witwer ansmall smile, Kim stated, \"I'll be back in a few.\" Then she disappearednout of the Pre-crime lab. V. Hampton the Hamster Dance…Breakout \"What to do,nwhat to do, what to do,\" Ron mumbled boredly, pacing about thenPre-crime lab. Glancing at his watch, Ron stated in a dark, unhappynvoice, \"Kim has been gone for what, five minutes?\" Crossing hisnarms and leaning against Anderton's desk, Ron continued to grumble,n\"How dare she leave me for so long!\" Rufus, climbing out ofnRon's pocket, hopped onto the desk and went over to Anderton'sncomputer. In a couple seconds, the naked mole rat had the computernup and running. Then, Rufus began rummaging through Anderton'snvarious files. Witwer stared at thenpink mole rat just next to him. Trying to edge away from the rodent,nWitwer inquired in an unsure voice, \"What is that pink thing?\" \"It's not anthing!\" Ron protested loudly, furrowing his eyebrows at Witwer. nComing over to the desk that Rufus was at, Ron leaned against thendesk, continuing, \"Rufus is a naked mole rat and he's my bestnbuddy.\" Witwer gave a slightnsniff of boredom. All of a sudden, fromnthe two tiny, circular speakers that were connected to the computer anboisterous tempo blasted into the once still room. The music beatnwas fast paced and up-beat. In Ron and Rufus's time, the musicnwould be classified as \"New Age\" and \"Techno/Trance\". But,nin the year two-thousand fifty-four, the music was the sound of youngnpeople. Witwer grumbled, \"Inhate that song!\" Turning to give Rufus a glare, Witwer demanded inna tone of a whine, \"Can't you find anything else besides 'Hamptonnthe Hamster Dance'?\" Rufus simply shook hisnhead and began grooving to the tempo of the music. Shortly therenafter, Ron began dancing to the music as well. With the two dancingnto the techno music, Witwer began feeling slightly afraid of the two. But then, Witwer feltnthe rope around his right wrist loosen. Giving a slight smile,nWitwer began carefully wiggling his way out of his bondages. Withnenough effort, Witwer knew, he could have himself free before thenparadoxical pair even discovered that he was free. Ron sang along to thenmusic, \"All right everybody, now here we go! It's a brand newnversion of the do-c-do!\" Witwer freed his right hand and begannworking on his left hand. Ron continued dancing, not even noticing,n\"Just stomp your feet and clap your hands, c'mon everybody it'snthe hamster dance!\" Witwer freed his leftnhand and immediately began working on his feet. Rufus and Ronncontinued dancing, completely oblivious to their escaping captive,n\"Bouncing time to the beat, hey you don't even have to move yournfeet!\" Witwer freed himselfnin time to see Ron and Rufus trying to shake their behinds. Archingnan eyebrow, Witwer simply watched the two trying their best to groovento the music. Ron continued singing,nshaking his behind at Rufus (who, in turn, shook his at Ron) \"Justnshake your 'thang' like I see ya move,\" Ron and Rufus hoppednaround on one foot, \"now steer around and feel the groove!\" Rufus leapt into thenair, hollering, \"Yee-ha!\" Ron exclaimed, \"Let'sntry it!\" Having seen enough ofnthe \"booty-shaking\", Witwer went over to the computer andnabruptly turned off the speakers. Awkward silence filled the room asnRon and Rufus continued dancing, a little slow to the knowledge thatntheir music had been cut off. Then, Ron, catching onnto the lack of music, began slowing his dancing. Glancing over atnWitwer standing with a smug smile plastered on his face, Ron couldnonly stare at Witwer in amazement. Ron continued dancing, but hisnpace lessened until he had stopped dancing altogether. Rufus, seeingnRon stop, brought an end to his dancing fun as well. Smirking, Witwernstated, mimicking the song and dipping his head as he spoke, \"Hey,nI think you're catching on.\" VI. To My Captive AudiencenRon and Rufusnimmediately put their hands up in the air. They didn't want tontangle with the man of whom they thought to be the one behind the setnup. Even still, Ron managed to growl, \"K.P. knows what you're upnto Witwer and when she finds out that you've taken us hostage she'snnot going to be very pleased with you!\" \"I'm sure,\"nWitwer replied with a sarcastic smile. Ron continued, \"K.P.nis the most intelligent person you'll ever find! In the past, thenpresent, even in the future she knows what's going on!\" Witwer nodded, \"Inhave no doubt…\" Ron cut him offnsharply, \"And she's a cheerleader so you'd be amazed at whatnKim can't do!\" \"That's prettynamazing…\" Witwer tried to interject but once again, Ron cut himnoff. \"Oh sure,\" Ronnstated sarcastically, putting his hand up in front of Witwer, \"Younmay disagree with me now,\" \"Ron,\" Witwerngrumbled, trying to get Ron to take a breath of air. Ron continued nonstop,n\"But mark my words when K.P. finds out about this she's going tonbe going through the roof!\" \"Ron!\" Witwernexclaimed. Ron immediately silenced, looking astonished at Witwer. nWitwer continued, giving a relieved sigh, \"I'm not taking you asnmy hostages!\" \"You're not?\"nRon questioned, surprised. He gave Rufus a quick glance to see whatnthe rodent was thinking. Rufus was just as astonished as Ron. nLooking back at Witwer, Ron narrowed his eyes and asked, \"Why arenyou not taking us as hostages?\" For an answer, Witwernpicked up the cylinder weapon that Kim had earlier found. Witwernstated, looking from the weapon to Ron, \"Look, we both know thatnthis is a gun, right?\" \"Right,\" Ronnagreed slowly. Then, as he was confused by what the object was, Ronnstated loudly, \"Wait, no, I don't know what that is!\" \"It's a stun gun,\"nWitwer stated coolly. \"It's a non-lethal tool that Pre-cops use.\" \"Oh, is that allnthat that is,\" Ron sighed in boredom. He had expected somethingnmore amazing to come from such an intriguing piece of equipment. Witwer re-asked hisnquestion, \"So we both know that this gun is useful, correct?\" \"Right on that,\"nRon replied confidently. Stepping up to Ron,nWitwer smiled, handing the gun over to Ron, \"Now you have it.\" nWitwer then stepped away from Ron and smiled, \"Now, if we can justnget past these childish antics, I'd like to finish watching thenvideos depicting the murder of Anne Lively I found in Anderton'sncollection.\" Ron gave a slow nod,nstating, \"Sure thing.\" Witwer gave a slightnsmile in acceptance, nodding his head a bit as he spoke, \"Good, I'mnglad that we can now sift through this information.\" VII. The Call Ron sat at one of thenchairs next to the large, clear computer screen. He was watchingnWitwer sift through various amounts of information that had beennrecovered from Anderton's belongings. One of the items that Witwernfound was a data chip recovered from Containment. The disk showednthe violent, drowning of a woman by the name of Anne Lively. Ronncould hardly watch the horrible act of murder taking place and thensame could be said for Rufus (who now resided on Ron's shoulder). But, unlike thencringing duo, Witwer was entranced with the scene unfolding on thenscreen. Then, once the disk was over, Witwer went back to Anderton'sncomputer and switched disks. The same murder of Anne Lively appearednon screen. Witwer watched that video in its entirety. Then, Witwernswitched disks again and kept replaying the wide-shot of the drowningnin the lake. Ron was about tonquestion Witwer's motive for replaying the same scene but Ron couldnsee the look of concentration and focus coming from Witwer's eyes. nRon knew better than to disturb the agent who clearly was on tonsomething. Although, Ron wished that Again, Witwer switchedndisks and watched the same wide-shot scene of the murder. Then,nafter a bit of rewinding the scene, Witwer finally stopped the video.n Taking the disk out of the computer, Witwer gave Ron a confidentnsmile and spoke with enthusiasm, \"I've stumbled onto tonsomething.\" \"And what might thatnbe?\" Ron inquired, suddenly interested in the new information. \"Anderton was on tonsomething with these two videos of the murder of Anne Lively,\"nWitwer stated. He thought for a second, looking at both disks. nThen, a thought crossed the agent's mind that he hadn't thoughtnof before. Witwer glanced up at Ron and stated, \"I bet someone isnframing Anderton for murder in order to get him off of this case. nThe person needed to shut Anderton up so he is doing the one thingnthat can get a person put away forever…and that's 'supposed'nmurder.\" Grabbing his blackncoat, Witwer headed to the door, motioning for Ron and Rufus tonfollow. Witwer told them, \"Come on you two, we're going to thenNorton Hotel and check out the crime area. I bet there's going tonbe more conclusive evidence there.\" \"Right with you,nSir,\" Ron smiled, standing. Rufus, standing on Ron's shoulder,ngave a small squeak of agreement and hopped excitedly on Ron'snshoulder. Just then, Witwer'sncell phone rang. Picking it up, Witwer greeted, \"Witwer.\" The soft, fearfulnvoice of Agatha spoke clearly through the line, \"Can you see?\" nThere was a brief period of silence before Witwer heard his own voicenspeaking on the line, \"It's me who you want, not Ron or Rufus.\"n The voice changed to a different tone, \"Do you know why I can'tnhear any of those things, Danny? Because right now, the Pre-cogsncan't see a thing.\" And then there came a sharp sound thatnresembled a bang. Witwer could saynnothing as he tried to gather his thoughts about what had just beennrevealed to him. Then, the quite, fearful voice of Agatha spokenagain, \"Through danger or trouble she'll be there on the double. nStay strong. See your two new friends.\" Witwer turned hisnfrightened eyes to a worried Ron and Rufus. Witwer knew that hisnsudden change of attitude had caused the two to become concerned. nThe looks of worry and wonder on Ron and Rufus's face made Witwernfeel slightly more comfortable working with them. Mustering up enoughncourage to erase his look of fear, Witwer stated, waving them over tonthe door, \"C'mon, let's go to the Norton Hotel.\" END OF PART ONE[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Indo not own any characters from Kim Possible or \"Minority Report\",nalthough I do claim Trisha Goodwin as my own, original character. nAll rights reserved to Disney and the creators of \"MinoritynReport\".

MinoritynReport13 janvier 2003 PART TWOnnVIII. Get a Clue The Pre-crime cops hadnalready been through the hotel room (in which Leo Crow was \"murdered\"nin) by the time Witwer, Ron, and Rufus arrived. Gordon, the Pre-copnin charge of the situation, had been surveying the scene of the crimenwith disdain. So far, all evidence seemed to point directly to JohnnAnderton being the murderer. After all, the crime had happenednexactly the way the Pre-cogs had predicted. Ron stood near thendoorway, looking about at the scene. As much as Ron wanted Andertonnto be innocent and Kim's hunch to be correct, Ron was starting tonget the impression that the Pre-cogs were right about Anderton beingna murderer. If Anderton hadn't been the murderer, Ron wondered,nthen why did the Pre-cop flee the scene of a crime and leave behindnhis gun? Gordon passednunknowingly by Ron. Gordon had been watching Witwer patrol the crimenscene but the naked mole rat perched upon Ron's shoulder distractednGordon. The Pre-cop paused and looked at Ron with questioning,nuncertain eyes. \"What are you doingnhere, kid?\" Gordon demanded. \"I'm uh, withnhim,\" Ron stated, pointing at Witwer. \"I'm helping to find thenmurderer in this crime.\" \"We already know whonthe murderer is,\" Gordon hissed. He glared accusingly at Ron andncontinued, \"The problem is, no kids on the crime scene…\" \"It's okaynGordon,\" Witwer said, looking up from the mound of pictures spreadnacross the queen-sized bed. \"The kid is with me.\" Witwer statednwith a half-smile, \"And the kid has a name. His name is RonnStoppable.\" \"Fine,\" Gordonngrowled, giving Ron a slight nod. Gordon still disliked Witwer. Thensnooty Federal agent had been the omen for trouble since the day henarrived, Gordon knew. The gum-chomping agent seemed to be toonself-assured, over confident, and most of all, too self-righteous tonever make a valuable addition to the elite Pre-crime fightingndepartment. Then, as Gordon wasnlooking about the room, he muttered, \"We acted too late and nownAnderton is on the run again. He took Agatha and now people can getnaway with murder because only Agatha can foresee future murders.\" Gordonnturned back to Witwer to see if the agent was listening. But,ninstead of Witwer listening to the Pre-cop, the agent was busynlooking over the pictures; Witwer held an expression of someone inndeep, meditative thought. Lookingnup from the bed, Witwer glanced at Gordon and motioned him over withnsimple flick of his wrist. When Gordon, Ron, and Rufus were next tonhim, Witwer stated, \"It doesn't make sense.\" Gordonnand Ron exchanged unsure glances. Witwer continued, noticing thentrio's disbelieving, questioning look, \"If you were a childnkiller, you took these pictures,\" Witwer waved at the picturesnspread across the bed. Witwer then glanced up at Ron and Gordon,ngiving them an inquisitive stare, \"Would you leave them out on thenbed for anybody to find?\" Gordonnshrugged, supposing, \"Anderton might've found them…\" Witwerngave a soft smile and asked, \"What kind of cop were you beforenthis?\" Gordonnreplied, \"Treasury agent; eight years.\" Gordon was unsure wherenWitwer was going with his questions. \"Thisnwould be your first actual murder scene?\" Witwer questionednnarrowly. \"Yeah.\" \"Inworked homicide before I went Federal,\" Witwer stated with a smallnsmile. \"This,\" Witwer pointed at the pictures, \"is what we'dncall an orgy of evidence.\" Takingnoff his glasses, Witwer asked Gordon, \"Know how many orgies I hadnas a homicide cop, Gordon?\" \"Hownmany?\" Witwer,nstill looking at the pictures, walked away from the bed while tuckingnhis glasses into his top right, breast pocket. Witwer stated flatly,n\"None.\" Comingnto Anderton's gun next to the broken pane of window, Witwer starednat the small, black gun and scratched his nose. Witwer turned ancurious eye out the window and then glanced back at Gordon and Ron. Witwernstated, \"This was all arranged.\" IX. Wrong Man A small whitentelevision inside of Lamar Burgess's den spoke quietly of thentragic incident at the Norton hotel. The news reporter spoke lowly,n\"Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Pre-crimenexperiment.\" Inside the house thentelephone rang. Lamar Burgess stared at the television with anmelancholic frown that was brought on by the anxious hours worryingnabout his friend, John Anderton. Lamar could care less that thenphone was ringing. Lamar didn't want to have to answer anybody'sncall. But, at any case, Lamar knew that his wife, Celeste Burgessnwould answer the call and send the caller on his way. Lamar turned hisnattention back to the reporter. The reporter continued, \"Sadlynenough, this failure was human. The protection team simply didn'tnget there in time to stop the murder. But the murder itself happenednexactly the way the Pre-cogs predicted it would. I think…\" Just then Celeste cameninto the room. Lamar ignored his wife's concerned expression thenreporter continued, \"…today's event put a human face on thenPre-crime system.\" Stopping behindnthe television, Celeste stated quietly, \"Danny Witwer's on thenphone. He says it's important.\" Celeste held the phone out tonLamar, still staring concernedly at him. Celeste inquired withnconcern, \"Lamar?\" The reporter's voicencarried through the stillness of the room, \"Pre-crime has stillnsuccessfully intervened…in hundreds of homicides…\" Lamar reluctantly tooknthe phone. Lamar questioned in a weary voice, \"What?\" Witwer's voice spokenclearly through the line, \"There's something wrong. We'renchasing the wrong man.\" \"What?\" Lamarnquestioned, beginning to feel slightly panicky. He hoped that Witwernhadn't found more than what the agent had been searching for. And,nLamar thought, if Witwer did find more than evidence to Leo Crow'snmurder, the agent would have to be dealt with. Lamar looked up tonCeleste and waved her away. If anything, Lamar certainly didn'tnwant his wife to know about what was really going on inside thenPre-crime experiment. Witwer continued,nsomewhat in a hurried voice, \"I don't want to say over the phone.n Meet me at Anderton's.\" There was a click andnthen there was silence. Lamar shut his miniature phone, clutching itnuncertainly in his hand. A slow sigh escaped Lamar's lips as henpondered his next action. For sure, Lamar knew, things were gettingnout of hand! X. Not an Echo Ron satnnervously on Anderton's white couch that was adjacent to Anderton'sncomputer. Rufus sat perched on Ron's shoulders. Like his friend,nRufus was equally confused about the situation at hand. Ron questioned outnloud quietly, not wanting to attract Witwer's attention, \"Inwonder what the real story is.\" Ron glanced at Rufus as if thennaked mole rat would supply him a response. Rufus simply shrugged,ngrunting his equal confusion. Shifting his gaze fromnRufus to Witwer, Ron saw the agent starting Anderton's computer. nRon questioned lowly, arching an eyebrow at Witwer, \"I wonder whatnhis real story is! I mean, from what Kim and Anderton said, it wasnWitwer who set this entire scheme up, to prove that Pre-crime has anhuman flaw.\" Again Ron fell quietnas he pondered his question. His counterpart, Rufus followed suit,nleaning against Ron's neck and lifting his pink chin with fournblack claws. Rufus then brightened, hopping up and down. Ron looked quickly tonhis friend and inquired, \"What is it Rufus? Do you know what isngoing on here?\" Rufus was about tonsqueak something out, but then his light faded and the mole ratnlowered his head and shook his head. Ron gave a disappointed sigh,nletting his head fall into the palm of his hands as Ron mutterednunder his breath, \"Now I really don't know who to believe and whonnot to.\" Glancing back at Rufus, Ron whined quietly, \"I justnwished I knew what was going on here!\" Just then, Witwer'snvoice broke Ron's concentration. Witwer stated, \"In due time,nkid, all shall be revealed.\" \"But I want to knownnow!\" Ron exclaimed, surprised at his own sudden outburst. \"I wish I knew too,\"nWitwer replied, giving Ron a half-smile. Witwer then turned back tonAnderton's desk and began fiddling with unknown objects on thendesk. Turning back to give Ron another half-smile, Witwer chuckled,n\"C'mon Ron, I know you want to ask me what I am doing chasingnJohn Anderton, right?\" \"Perhaps,\" Ronnreplied smartly. Witwer laughed, \"Incan see that you're a great asset to your friend, Kim Possible.\" nWitwer came over to Ron; an object was hidden in the agent's hand. nSitting on the couch next to Ron, Witwer revealed the hidden objectnto Ron. The object was a small, black, plastic cylinder. Witwernasked Ron, \"Do you know what this is Ron?\" \"Um,\" Ronnbreathed, looking down at the curious object Witwer was showing him. nRufus gazed down at the object with curiosity. Not seeing exactlynwhat the object was, Rufus crawled down Ron's arm and came up tonthe object. \"I'd be careful,nRufus,\" Witwer warned the rodent gently. \"This is a drug inhaler.n The remaining chemicals in there wouldn't affect us, but Incouldn't really say the same thing for a small creature such asnyourself.\" Rufus backed away fromnthe object. Ron looked from the inhaler up at Witwer and inquired,n\"This is why you've been chasing Witwer?\" \"Well, yes,\"nWitwer confessed. \"At least, that's what I originally thought wenwere chasing him after.\" Witwer noticed Ron and Rufus's confusednlooks. Witwer explained, \"I was snooping about this place when Incame across these drug inhalers. I thought, 'hey, this could be anpotential hazard for Pre-crime fighting. I need to investigate thisnfurther', and so I did. I didn't know, at the time when I met upnwith Anderton again, that he was already on the run from othernPre-crime cops. \"When I confrontednAnderton about his use of drugs while in an elevator, he held a gunnup to my neck and told me to stay away from him. I was stillnconvinced that Anderton was merely reacting to what I had recovered. nWhen the alarm went off and Anderton's panic increased, I thennrealized what the real mission was.\" Ron inquired, \"Sonwhat now? What are you chasing Anderton for?\" Witwer gave a softnchuckle, \"I'm not chasing him anymore. There's no need to. nAnderton's an innocent man and I have no interest in chasing a mannwho committed no crime.\" \"But what about LeonCrow's death?\" Ron inquired. \"Didn't the Pre-cogs predictnthat Anderton would kill him?\" \"Indeed, they did,\"nWitwer nodded. \"But the one thing that the Pre-cogs didn't expectnwas Anderton to change the course of his future, and thus prove thenPre-cogs as well as the experts wrong. And he did.\" Raising theninhaler to where he could see it clearly, Witwer smiled, \"Anderton'sna smart guy. He knows that he would never commit murder, even if thenperson was the one who killed his child. Perhaps, Anderton would bennearly driven to kill the person but the mere fact of wanting to seenjustice in action would stop him.\" \"How do you know allnthis?\" Ron inquired. \"I don't know,\"nWitwer replied. He gave a small laugh, lowering the inhaler. Witwernchuckled, looking at Ron, \"Just a hunch I guess. Trade secrets Inlearned when I went Federal.\" Witwer thought for a bit, thinking. nThen, reaching inside of his pocket, Witwer pulled out a smallnrectangular shaped object that was smaller than the palm of his hand. Witwer stated to anconfused Ron, \"This is a tape recorder. I want you to record thenentire conversation I have with Lamar and don't stop recording evennafter we're finished.\" \"Why's that?\"nRon inquired, raising an eyebrow. Witwer gave a smallnsigh while reaching back into his pocket. When Witwer drew out hisnhand again, Witwer was holding his rosary that he kept with him atnall times of the day. Bringing the rosary up to his lips, Witwerngave the cross a gentle kiss. Then, lowering his head, Witwer restednhis head on his hands and took a deep breath. Watching the agentnwith concern, Ron supposed, \"Oh, I see. It's that bad, isn'tnit?\" XI. ConspiracynTheory Kim and Andertonnstudied the information Agatha was giving out through the computer. nAnderton had been copying the information onto another disk andnwatching the scene unfolding on the computer screen. But the actionnon the screen seemed to be different than normal viewing. It wasnalmost as if the footage was being played backwards. Anderton asked Kim,n\"Does this appear to be copying over, backwards?\" \"It appears thatnway,\" Kim replied, studying the screen. She thought for a couplenseconds before declaring, \"This would make more sense if it wasnplaying in normal format.\" \"This is still thenmurder of Anne Lively,\" Anderton stated in a calm, but weary voice.n \"But it looks to have more information on it than on the othernfiles taken from Containment and Arthur and Dashnell.\" Kim smiled atnAnderton, \"It was a great idea to download information directly offnof Agatha, Mr. Anderton! You said that Agatha was the only Pre-cognwho could function on its own and what a better way to solve a murdernmystery than to go back to its original source!\" Anderton gave a slightnlaugh. Then he asked, turning to Kim, \"How do you think your boynRon is doing back in the Pre-crime lab?\" Kim gave a quiet laugh. nAnderton prodded gently, chuckling a bit, \"Do you think he andnRufus are keeping a good eye on Witwer?\" \"Knowing them,\"nKim chuckled. \"Witwer is already long gone and it's probably themnwho are tied up. But, at any rate, I should be hearing from themnsoon.\" Then, as if on cue,nKim's Kimmunicater sounded its melodic ring. Plucking her phonenout of her pocket, Kim greeted, \"Kim here.\" \"Kim,\" came Ron'snshaky voice and face. Seeing Ron'snquivering and fearful look, Kim immediately became worried. Kimnquickly inquired, \"Ron? What's wrong? Are you alright? Where'snWitwer?\" \"I'm fine andnWitwer's here,\" Ron stated. \"But where are you,nRon?\" Kim demanded in an urgent, concerned voice. \"Anderton'snhouse,\" Ron told Kim in a quiet, hushed voice. Taking a deepnbreath, Ron spoke quietly, \"Something's about to happen and it'snnot good. We need you to come over right away!\" \"Ron,\" Kim startednto say, but just then Ron's link disappeared. Kim continued toncall out, \"Ron! Ron!\" but no answer. Looking up at Anderton,nKim stated in an urgent voice, \"Ron and Rufus need us! They'renat your house!\" Anderton nodded,npicking Agatha off the table. Setting the Pre-cog on her feet,nAnderton inquired softly to the Pre-cog, \"Do you see anything,nAgatha?\" \"See the firenescape,\" Agatha whispered. \"That's where you're Ron and Rufusnwill be.\" XII. The Murder ofnAnne Lively Witwer walked towardsnLamar (who had just entered Anderton's apartment). On Anderton'sndesk Witwer had earlier placed Anderton's gun. Picking the weaponnup, Witwer walked over to Lamar and handed the gun over to hisnsuperior. Witwer told hisnsuperior, \"We recovered this from Leo Crow's hotel room.\" Lamar took the small,nblack weapon. Giving a sad sigh, Lamar remarked, \"I remember whennI gave this to him back in Baltimore.\" Witwer pointed to thenseat behind Anderton's desk, \"Please, Sir.\" Sitting heavily down,nLamar looked patiently up at Witwer, stating, \"Tell me what younhave.\" Witwer took a seatnnext to the computer. Putting in a small, circular disk, Witwernpointed at the screen and looked to Lamar. Witwer stated as imagesnstarted appearing on the blank screen, \"This is the murder of anwoman named Anne Lively.\" Witwer watched the murder scene on thenscreen. From the couch, Ronnheld the small recorder between the palms of his hands. Ron wasnnervous about trying to edge the truth out of Lamar. After all, Kimnwasn't there to make sure things didn't get out of hand! And,nwithout Kim, even Rufus (a usually stout little figure) was hiding innRon's pocket in fear. Lamar, watching thenscreen with vacant eyes, stated, \"Yeah, John told me about this. nYou got this from containment?\" \"Yes,\" Witwernreplied. \"This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashnell. Agatha'snstream was missing.\" Then Witwer took the disk out of thencomputer. Taking out another disk, Witwer blew on it, clearing thendust off of it and put the disk inside the computer. Sitting backndown again, Witwer stated, \"Now this one is from the cyber parlor. nAnderton downloaded this directly from Agatha. And Rufus Rileynrecorded it.\" Witwer then begannwatching the screen again. The images of Anne Lively's murdernseemed to match directly. There was almost no difference between thentwo video documents. Giving a slightnchuckle, Lamar commented, \"It's the same Pre-vision.\" Witwer stood up,nremarking, \"Not quite.\" Heading up to the screen, Witwer pointednat the water ripples. \"Look at the surface wind across the water. nWatch the ripples…moving away from the shore. Now the secondnimage…\" Witwer went back to the computer. \"…this is the onenfrom Containment.\" Witwer switched disks, continuing, \"This isnwhat Art and Dashnell saw.\" Heading back to thenscreen, Witwer told Lamar, \"Watch the ripples.\" Looking back tonLamar, Witwer remarked, \"The wind has changed. The ripples…\"nturning back to the screen, \"are moving the other way.\" Witwer pointed at thenmoving ripples and then walked away from the screen. His eyes werenlocked on Lamar as Witwer continued, \"This murder's taking placenat two different times.\" Leaning on the computer desk, Witwerncontinued, \"According to the sentry, Anderton was watching this atnContainment right before he was tagged.\" \"Well, I know,\"nLamar replied slowly. \"Anderton came to me, told me about thenmissing data stream.\" Lamar added a slight smile to his statement,n\"He was concerned that you might find it.\" Witwer gave a smallnlaugh, replying, \"Well, he was right. I did find it. It wasninside of Agatha the whole time.\" Witwer walked back over to thenscreen. Staring at the scene going on on the screen, Witwer asked,n\"So, the question is, why would someone want this erased from thendata file?\" Raising his left handnand closing his eyes, Lamar stated in a quiet, patient voice,n\"Danny…listen, tell me what you're thinking.\" Coming back over tonthe desk, Witwer stated, \"I'm thinking that someone got away withnmurder.\" Opening his eyes,nLamar tried to hide his panicky face. Lamar knew that Witwer wasngetting way too close on naming who the actual killer of Anne Livelynwas. To try and cover up his anxiety, Lamar inquired in an innocentnvoice, \"But how?\" Witwer stated, sensingnthe nervousness in Lamar's voice, \"Well, Jad told me sometimesnthe Pre-cogs see the same murder more than once.\" \"It's called annecho,\" Lamar cut in. \"Jad called itnPre-cog 'déjà vu,\" Witwer smirked. Lamar stated, giving anlengthy sigh, \"Well, we teach the techs to identify them andndisregard them.\" \"Yeah but,\" Witwerngave a soft chuckle. \"What if the technicians thought henwas looking at an echo? What if what he was really looking at was ancompletely different murder altogether?\" \"I don'tnunderstand.\" Witwer continued,npicking up strength in his accusations, \"All you'd have to do isnhire someone to kill Anne Lively. Someone like a drifter, a neuronnaddict, someone with nothing to lose. Pre-crime stops the murdernfrom taking place, haloes the killer, takes him away. But then,nright then, someone else, having reviewed the prevision and dressednin the same clothes, commits the murder in the exact same way.\" Pointing at thenscreen, Witwer looked at Lamar, licked his lips, and continued,n\"Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo.\" nWitwer waved his hand in front of his face slowly. \"Erases it.\" Witwer then gave Lamarna steely glare before turning back to the screen. Witwer gave a softnscoff, remarking, \"Of course, it would have to be someone withnaccess to the Pre-visions in the first place. Someone fairly highnup.\" Lamar knew that Witwernhad found him out. Judging by the agent's cold, accusing eyes,nLamar knew that it was only a matter of time before the agent leakednword out to the public. \"You can't prove andamn thing!\" Lamar hissed angrily. Witwer gave a smallnsmile, chuckling, \"Oh, I think I can.\" \"How can you?\"nLamar questioned, forcing a laugh. \"You and your kid friend don'tnhave any proof!\" Witwer gave thendirector a cold glare, trying to give the impression that there wasnno evidence whatsoever to convict Lamar Burgess of any crime. Lamar saw the look ofndistress in the agent's eyes and chuckled, \"Oh, so you don'tnhave any written or documented proof, now do you?\" Ron, standing up,nstated loudly, \"Yes!\" Lamar and Witwernquickly looked to Ron. Lamar saw the tiny black conference recordernin Ron's hands. A sadistic smile spread across Lamar's lips asnthe director turned to Witwer and gave the now truly distressed agentna cunning smile. Ron, seeing the errornhe had made, quickly added, \"I mean, no!\" \"Too late,\" Lamarnhissed, standing. In his hands, Lamar held Anderton's blacknpistol. He aimed it at Ron, demanding harshly, \"Hand over thatnconference recorder and perhaps I'll let you live.\" Witwer, thinkingnquickly, stated, \"Why kill him? He's just a decoy?\" Lamar turned to givenWitwer a questioning stare. Witwer continued, nodding at Ron, \"Hendoesn't have the real conference recorder.\" Witwer took a quick,ndeep breath before boldly stating, \"I do.\" Witwer pulled outnAnderton's drug inhaler. The way in which Witwer was holding theninhaler the common eye it would appear to be another miniaturenconference recorder. Lamar looked from Ronnto Witwer, unsure of whom to believe. Finally, Lamar hissed, \"Boy,ngive me that recording device.\" Witwer cut in, makingneye contact with Ron, \"Ron, get yourself and Rufus out of here. nUse the fire escape. Be quick about it.\" Ronnthen began slinking towards the fire door, fully aware of Lamarnfollowing his every move with Anderton's gun. Rufus, tremblingnwith fear, dove inside of Ron's shirt pocket and remained hidden innthe dark pocket. Ron gave Rufus a friendly pat to assure both ofntheir confidence. TonLamar, Witwer hissed, \"Ron knows nothing of Pre-crime or even whatnis going on here. He is from the past and thus he could care lessnwhat goes on here. But I do know what's going on here. It's menwho you want, not Ron or Rufus.\" Stepping backwards towards thendoor, stating in a low voice, \"So leave them out of it.\" Lamarngave an angry growl and fired the gun at Ron. But Witwer was quicknand stepped in between the bullet and Ron. XIII. Psychic Truth Anderton kept his eyesntrained on the road as he made his way through the bustling trafficnalong the Mag-Lev, the magnetic network of roads used for futurentravel. Even though speeding was almost impossible, Anderton managednto keep an ever so increasing rate of speed on his Lexus. Next to Anderton satnKim Possible. The teenage super-hero was busy talking on her visualncell phone with Wade. Anderton heard Kim discussing with the boyngenius, \"No Wade, I don't think I'll be able to make it in timenfor cheerleading practice! I'm really up to my pom-poms in thisncase! I would really appreciate it if you could somehow get a holdnof my dad or mom so that way they could call my coach to let my teamnknow that I can't make it.\" Kimnwent silent for a couple seconds before continuing, \"Oh, don'tnworry! I'm going to try my hardest to get back in time though!\" nKim then said, \"Oh thanks Wade, you're the best!\" ThennKim closed her cell phone. Anderton, giving a slight smirk,ninquired, \"Missing something important back in your world KimnPossible?\" \"Yeah,nschool, cheerleading,\" Kim stated with a sigh. \"If only my teamnknew how difficult it is trying to help people while doing homework,nattending classes, and making it in time for cheerleading practice! nThen perhaps maybe Bonnie would get a clue and stop trying to make menout as a villain!\" Andertonnsmiled comfortingly, \"I don't know if this will help any, but Indon't believe that there isn't anything that you can't do, KimnPossible.\" \"Aww,nthank you!\" Kim smiled gratefully. Justnthen, the voice of Agatha broke in. Agatha's voice was full ofnfear and agony as she cried, \"…'because right now, the Pre-cogsncan't see a thing.'…'you're wrong,'…' I may not benable to, but I know someone who can.'\" Agathanthen fell into fitful sobs as she began trembling in fear. Kimnturned in her seat to look at the Pre-cog. Kim inquired gently,n\"Agatha, dear, who's death are you predicting?\" Agatha,ngazing vacantly at the back of Kim's seat, replied in a voicensimilar to Ron's, \"'Yes…I mean, no…\" Kimnknew that that expression belonged to Ron. Giving a startled gasp,nKim cried, \"We've got to move faster Anderton! Ron is inndefinite trouble! I think Witwer is going to kill him!\" Andertonnnodded, but said with a sigh, \"This thing only goes one speed andnthat's the speed limit.\" Giving Kim an assuring smile, Andertonnsaid, \"I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do about it.\" Justnthen, Agatha gave another cry and exclaimed, \"'You saved my life,nMr. Witwer…but why?'…'Take care kid…'\" Kimnand Anderton exchanged curious, questioning looks. XIV. Silence Witwernstaggered backwards a couple steps. He had hardly felt the bulletnpenetrate his skin in the middle of his right chest. The fresh woundnsent a flood of crimson blood that began rapidly spreading acrossnWitwer's white dress shirt. The blood traveled freely downnWitwer's chest and pooled in the palm of Witwer's hand as thenagent felt where the bullet had struck him. Witwerncontinued backing towards the door with Ron and Rufus right behindnhim. Witwer asked Ron between startled pants, \"Hey, kid, are younalright?\" \"We'renfine,\" replied Ron in a quaky voice. He and Rufus, through allntheir missions together, had never actually seen someone shot before.n And what had amazed Ron even more was Witwer's sacrifice that henhad made in order to ensure Ron and Rufus's safety. Witwernreached out to door handle and gripped the golden knob firmly. nWitwer was going to free Ron and Rufus from their captivity innAnderton's house. And, with any luck or perhaps a miracle, Witwernthought, Kim Possible and John Anderton would be outside to lend anhelping hand. \"But regardless,\" Witwer thought silently andndeterminedly, \"This kid and his pet rat need to get out of herensafely.\" Anothernbang sounded through the room. Witwer gave a small cry of pain as henfelt the round strike his hand. Like the first shot, blood begannflowing out of the wound. But in this injury, there was less of thencrimson fluid. The blood traveled down Witwer's hand that wasnstill clutched to the doorknob. Then, the blood began drippingnsteadily into a small pool on the floor. Lamar,nedging closer to the two, stated in a malicious, dark tone, \"Do younknow what I hear?\" Lamar pointed upwards, still keeping a steadynglare on Witwer. There was a long pause that was filled with annuneasy silence that was mixed with Witwer's short, raspy pants. nLamar continued, \"Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs; nonhovercraft out the window, and no clickety-click of little spyders.\" Therenwas another brief pause. Lamar inquired with a slight, cunningnsmile, \"Do you know why I can't hear any of those things, Danny?\"n Witwer simply glared at Lamar. The director continued in a lownvoice, \"Because right now, the Pre-cogs can't see a thing.\" \"You'renwrong,\" Witwer growled, trying to fight off his decreasingnstrength. Using what little energy he had left, Witwer twisted thendoorknob and opened the door wide enough for Ron and Rufus to escape.n Witwer covered the two's escape by using his body as a protectivenshield against any more fire from Lamar. Lamarnhissed through a chuckle, \"You know that I can easily catch up withnthem and take back what is rightfully mine.\" Lamar watched Witwernfall against the door, closing it. Giving a sniff of annoyance,nLamar continued, \"Your death will have been all for nothing. Youncan't stop what is going to happen.\" Witwerncollapsed to the ground, sliding against the door as he fell to thencarpet. Giving a slight chuckle, Witwer replied, \"I may not benable to stop you, but I know someone who can.\" Witwer added in andark growl, \" And she will .\" XV. The Fourth Person Ron stumbled out thendoor and onto the fire escape. Reaching in his pocket, Ron pullednout a trembling Rufus. Ron gave the naked mole rat a friendly,ncomforting pat and spoke quietly, \"Don't worry Rufus,neverything's going to be okay.\" Reaching into hisnother pocket, Ron pulled out the mini black, tape recorder thatnWitwer had given them to record the entire collection of evidence. nRon stared at the device, amazed at the importance that such a smallndevice could hold. Right behind him, the door suddenly closed. Ron,nglancing over at Rufus, stated, \"We need to get this to K.P. andnAnderton before it's too late.\" \"Ron!\" a familiarnvoice called out. \"K.P.?\" Ronninquired, looking out at the D.C. skyline. He couldn't see her! \"Over here!\" Kimnexclaimed from Ron's left side. Ron, turning to hisnleft, saw Kim in Anderton's red Lexus. Ron inquired, pointing atnthe car in surprise, \"How did you get that way up here?\" \"No time tonexplain,\" Kim replied. She motioned for Ron and Rufus to get intonthe car. Kim stated, \"You called a little while ago about Witwer. nWhere is he?\" \"He's still innthere,\" Ron replied, pointing back inside Anderton's house. nRufus hopped off Ron's shoulder and dashed inside of the red Lexus.n Ron followed suit. Hopping into the car, Ron continued, \"Lamar isnthe one behind Anderton's framing and he's also behind AnnenLively's murder. When Lamar tried to kill Rufus and I, Witwernstepped in and took the bullet himself.\" Anderton, overhearingnRon's comment about Witwer, thought to himself, \"So it was DannynWitwer whom Agatha was referring to as being the fourth member tonhelp solve this case!\" Ron turned to Kim andninquired in a panicky voice, \"I thought no one dies in ournepisodes, Kim! They only get big boo-boos!\" \"No one has died andnno one will die,\" Kim replied with determination in her voice. nLooking to Anderton at the steering wheel, Kim asked, \"Ready tonsave the day, Anderton, and put the real murderer behind bars?\" \"I'm all aboutnit,\" Anderton smiled. Kim told Ron, \"Getnin the car Ron! We're going to save the day!\" XVI. Kim to thenRescue Lamar made his waynover to Witwer. The director could see the bloodstain on Witwer'snwhite shirt growing larger. Through Witwer's looks of near-deathnand utter hopelessness, Lamar could still see the fire raging innWitwer's eyes as the agent struggled to remain conscious in ordernto protect Ron, Rufus, and the mission. Lamar sensed Witwer'snunderstanding of his own sacrifice that he had made in order tonprotect more human lives. By now Witwer wasncoughing up blood and slowly fading into non-existence. But still,nWitwer managed to keep a steely glare on Lamar. A jolt of pain rannthrough Witwer's chest and he shivered at the sudden coldness henwas feeling. As much as he didn't want to, Witwer felt himselfnslipping away. Wearily, Witwernreached into his pocket and brought out his rosary. Giving hisntreasure a sad, melancholic frown, Witwer kissed the rosarynfaithfully. Then, he felt someone's presence in front of him. nRaising his eyes, Witwer saw Lamar standing in front of him. It wasnthen that Witwer knew that his time was over; he was done. Clutching his rosaryntightly in his bloody hand, Witwer mumbled, \"I'm sorry Trisha…\" Lamar chuckled andnaimed the gun at Witwer and fired the last shot. But, seconds prior,nRon had entered the room and fired the stun-gun at Lamar, knockingnthe director away from Witwer. And, in the process of knocking thendirector down, Ron also halted the bullet's path. Like Lamar, thenbullet was flung harmlessly back a couple feet. \"Nice save,\" Kimnremarked with a smile, patting Ron on the back. \"Thanks,\" Ronnsmiled proudly. Ron watched Kim and Anderton rush towards Lamar andnquickly wrestle the elderly man into custody. Hanging back a big,nRon gave a frown as he thought, \"I sure hope we came in time tonsave Witwer.\" Just then, there camena thunderous rumble. The rumble belonged to several pairs ofnjetpacks the Pre-cops had to travel around in. The Pre-cops landednon the fire escape just outside of Anderton's apartment. Fletchernand Gordon could be seen looking through the window at the scenengoing on inside. Then, two othernPre-cops entered Anderton's room from Anderton's Lexus. ThenPre-cops immediately went to help Kim and Anderton arrest Ron wentnto Witwer to see if the agent was alright. Ron tried getting thenPre-cops' attention in order to help the injured Witwer. The two Pre-copsnheading towards the captive Lamar noticed the barely conscious Witwerntrying to crawl out of the doorway. The Pre-cops noticed how badlyninjured Witwer was and went to go help him. Scarlet liquid laynheavily in the area around the badly wounded agent, furthering thensense of urgency and immediacy in Witwer's injuries. The injured agentnwinced with every movement he made (even breathing) as the sharp,nstinging pain in both his arm and his chest made its way throughnWitwer's body. Witwer felt a throb pounding his head andnmomentarily blacked out from the pain's intensity, collapsing tonthe ground. When Witwer opened his eyes a couple seconds later,nWitwer discovered that he was being carefully dragged towards thencouch. Again, Witwer felt his mind go numb with dizziness and thusnfainted for the second time. Gordon came up next tonAnderton. Anderton glanced at Gordon with an unsure, uncertain look.n To reassure his old friend, Gordon gave a small smile and stated,n\"It's alright Anderton.\" Anderton gave Gordon a questioningnstare. Gordon continued, smiling, \"We got a red ball and a brownnball. The red one said 'Witwer' and the red one said 'Lamar'.\" \"But how did younknow to come here?\" Anderton inquired curiously. Kim glanced upnfrom helping the other Pre-cops secure Lamar. Gordon continued,n\"Over at the Norton Hotel, the last thing Witwer told us was thatnhe was going to your apartment to show Lamar something. At thatntime, we didn't know what Lamar was going to do until we got backnto the Pre-crime lab.\" Kim, stepping forward,ninquired, \"But how did the Pre-visualization work in the Pre-crimenlab when all the Pre-cogs weren't there?\" Gordon gave a slightnshrug. Anderton and Kim looked at Agatha, who simply gave a smallnsmile and turned away from the trio. Kim then turned back to Lamarnand stated slowly, \"So you were going to kill Witwer because henknew something.\" Lamar gave Kim ansteely glare but said nothing. Kim continued, an idea suddenlyncoming to mind, \"And because Witwer knew something, you were goingnto kill him and Ron as well! You figured that the Pre-cogs couldn'tnsee anything so that's why you allowed yourself to come up here andnbe led through this discussion with Witwer! And then, when henrevealed to you your worst fears, you tried to eliminate the source!\" Kim suddenly gave ansmall gasp as she suddenly discovered the answer to Anderton'snquestion of being set-up for murder. Kim stated, looking accusinglynat Lamar, \"And Anderton was right on track with the Anne Livelyncase that Witwer later picked up! You tried to kill Ron and Witwernbecause they knew too much about that case! When you found out thatnAnderton was getting closer to the truth of the Anne Lively case youndecided to eliminate him permanently from the picture because younknew that when Anderton was caught for 'murder', he would go tonprison and never return.\" Lamar hissed angrily,n\"That Anne Lively wanted her daughter back but I knew that withoutnAgatha, none of the Pre-crime experiment would be around! So that'snwhy I had to eliminate Anne Lively!\" Kim gave a gasp,nrealizing that Lamar was confessing his entire malefactions. Kimnstated accusingly, \"And when Anderton took up the case once morenand came too close to the truth you decided to eliminate him too?\" \"Yeah,\" Lamarngrowled deeply. \"And the plan would have gone accordingly if itnwasn't for you stinking kids!\" Lamar then gave a short laugh,nstating, \"But the Pre-cogs' pre-visualization still works! Theynstill managed to predict the murder of Danny Witwer! So the systemnstill works and there's no flaw!\" Lamar gave another short,ninsane laugh. Lamar continued, looking at an unhappy Ron and Rufus,n\"You can file that in your report kid!\" \"Oh go have yourselfna future burrito,\" Ron scoffed, waving his hand absently at Lamar. nRon didn't care how insulting Lamar was because Ron knew that Lamarnwas going to prison for murder and future justice had been served. The Pre-cops then tooknLamar away, leaving Anderton, Kim, Ron, and Rufus alone in thendisturbed apartment. The house fell into an awkward silence. Then finally, Andertonnbroke the silence. Offering his hand to Kim, Anderton thanked, \"Inwanted to thank you Kim Possible for helping me out on this case. Inam always in your debt.\" \"No biggy,\" Kimnsmiled, nonchalantly waving her hand at Anderton. She laughed, \" So not the drama!\" Anderton turned to Ronnand Rufus, giving them a smile. Anderton smoke in a friendly manner,n\"And I definitely want to thank you two, for being so brave to staynwith Witwer the entire time and make sure that he didn't get on mynback. I really appreciated that.\" Ron gave a slight nod,nstating, \"It's all in a day's work, you know how it goes.\" nThen Ron thought of another idea that he had wanted to say but didn'tnhave enough confidence to speak his mind. Ron spoke up, \"You know,nWitwer was just doing his job; as did we all. Witwer had been sentnfrom the F.B.I. to research the Pre-crime experiment and see if hencould find a flaw…and he did!\" Ron began slowlynpacing the room, taking a serious tone of voice that he rarely used,n\"And of course, Witwer did find the flaw…and, it was like he hadnsaid before, it was a human flaw. But you know, Witwer was justndoing his job and he was doing it to the best of his ability! He'snjust a good natured fellow like you and I. I think we should cutnsome slack on the name-callings from now on. We need to realize thatnpeople are simply doing their job by being arrogant and pompous!\" Anderton snorted anlaugh while Kim remarked with surprise, \"Wow, is this Ron Stoppablenwhom I have been listening to?\" Ron blushed, \"Well,ndon't expect that light to stay on for much longer! I have anreputation to uphold!\" Ron turned to his pal, Rufus, and asked,n\"Isn't that right, Rufus?\" Rufus gave a nod andnan agreeing squeak. While Ron and Rufusnwere engaging in playful conversation, Kim turned to Anderton andnsaid, \"Well, we best be getting going now.\" \"See you later KimnPossible,\" Anderton smiled. Agatha gave a small smile and waved atnKim. Then, the Kimmunicaterngave its typical ring. Kim signaled Ron and Rufus over to her. nAnswering the phone with her typical greeting, Kim said, \"Wade,nwe're ready to come home.\" \"Already on top ofnthat, Kim,\" Wade smiled. He hit a couple buttons on his computernbefore giving Kim a broad grin. In a couple secondsnwith a brilliant flash of white, Kim, Ron, and Rufus vanished fromnthe room and back to the past.

Just a nice, evil little story.nplease review! Prologue: \"Belle Packard, by mandate of the District Columbia Precrime Division, I'mnplacing you under arrest for the future murder of James Sommers at the datenof July 24th, 2054 at seventeen-hundred hours and twenty-three minutes.\" Anyoung woman with dark brown hair said to the teenaged girl that she hadnpressed up against the wall to keep her from struggling. Behind them came three others of the Precrime Division, one carryingna halo that paralyzed the suspect. Placing it on the nineteen-year-old'snhead, Belle Packard was pulled out of the kitchen in silence. ShaenMichillen looked over her shoulder at the butcher knife lying on thencounter before shrugging and leaving the apartment with a satisfied smirk. Upon her fair body was a duster that fell to her ankles, long pants and antight shirt. and these were all black. Except for her brown hair, Shae worennothing but raven colors to keep herself hidden in the shadows. She was annagent that stopped murders before they even happened and took great pridenin her job. Around her neck were a chain and a silver ring upon it that hadna secret significance in which no one except herself knew of. Shae tendednto keep to herself, but was an intelligent and open person. \"Well done capture, Shae.,\" a blonde-haired girl that was standing outsidenthe apartment door said with a smile, \"You almost didn't make it.\" \"I would have, Tammy,\" Shae replied, \"But when dealing with future murders,none must be cautious.\" Tammy laughed, \"I don't see how. We all knew it was going to happen and wencan't alter the future. But we can prevent death.\" \"That's true. But I don't want to be responsible for a false crime. I wouldnnever forgive myself.\" The two women left the apartment building quickly, getting into thenPrecrime ship and heading back to their headquarters in Washington D.C.nAnother murder stopped and it was all in a day's work for the workers ofnPrecrime. The creation of this division had taken homicides down ninetynpercent in the last few years, making the program extremely successful. Thenprogram was. perfect. The precogs never lied and were never wrong.[Chapter 2] After arriving to the Precrime Division central command center, Shae wentnstraight into the faculty room, pouring herself a cup of coffee. Only fournmonths ago had she started working at this place and already she was a high-nclass agent. She stopped all murders from occurring. except for one. Ansmall sigh escaped her as she looked out at the city through a window, onenhand holding the ring on her necklace in a loose grip. \"Cole, I'm home! Cole.? Come on, baby, this isn't funny. You promised menyou wouldn't go anywhere. Enough of these hide and seek games-COLE!\" Snapping back to reality with a short gasp, Shae dropped the mug onto thenground and watched it shatter, coffee spilling onto the floor. She stumblednback for a moment, breathing heavily and clenching the ring even tighter innher right hand. A few other workers turned and looked at her, eithernconcerned or puzzled of what just occurred. Tammy was standing nearby whilentalking with her co-agents when she heard the break of glass. Jogging overnto Shae, Tammy placed a hand on her friend's shoulder, \"Michillen, are younall right? What's the matter with you?\" \"N-Nothing. I'm fine. Just lost my grip,\" the brunette lied, looking downnat the broken glass. Tammy frowned. \"Yeah. Why don't you head upstairs? I'll get someone tonclean that mess up for you.\" Nodding, Shae quickly left the faculty room. Later that evening, Shae stood in the dark area where murders werenpredicted, sitting in her own office chair while she was looking at one shenhad stopped earlier. Sipping a bit of her coffee and setting down the mug,nshe leaned forward as she watched it take place. Another stabbing... Herncapture wasn't the one who had killed her fiancée. One hand clenched hernring on her necklace as she sighed in slight frustration. During this,nTammy had walked slowly up the stairs to the Precrime room, carrying whatnwas left of a sandwich. She finally reached the top of the stairs and sawnShae sitting by herself. \"Hey Shae, Everything going okay?\" The brown-haired woman nearly jumped in surprise, letting go of the ringnand turning off the recording. \"Yeah, I'm just fine.\" Tammy smiled weakly at her, thinking better than to ask Shae about what shenhad been looking at. She walked up to the window overlooking the threenPrecogs and gazed sadly down at them. \"You know, I always feel sorry fornthem... They have to see all these horrible murders over and over again...nThey can't have normal lives like most of us...\" \"I've heard they've seen them all their life,\" Shae stood up and walkednnext to her, \"You know, we're only using them. Sometimes, I feel guiltynabout working here but since he died...\" \"I know what it's like to loose someone close to you,\" Tammy kept her gazenon the temple, thinking about her mother and father... how she had to watchnboth of them get shot. \"Perhaps losing someone is reason enough to catch the murderers... Tonprevent people from feeling the same as we do,\" Shae turned her back on thenPrecogs and clenched a fist. Agent John Anderton came into the room, slipping those cool gloves onnhis hands as he did so. He looked at Shae and Tammy, smirking at his co-nagents, \"Making another late shift, you two?\" Tammy looked at John, a smile crossing her face, \"Yeah, I thought that I'dnspend a bit more time here, just incase you guys needed me.\" \"Or you're just putting in the overtime for extra money?\" He laughed. \"Well, that too.\" Tammy answered. \"The economy has gone down lately... No wonder so many people are doingnovertime,\" Shae added. \"You two do too much, you know that?\" John looked at them with a slightngrin. Tammy chuckled, \"Hey, if it's for a good cause, then I'm all for it.\" An awkward silence fell between the three of them before they heardnfootsteps of another approaching them. They exchanged glances with eachnother before Shae went back to her own work that was lying upon her desk.nTammy turned away as well, looking down at the precogs again. Blinking atnthe two girls in bewilderment, John turned around and found himself face tonface with someone he had expected that he would never see again. Danny Witwer. \"You. It can't be you. You were shot!\" John managed to choke out. The black-haired man grinned at Chief Anderton, \"Takes more than that tonkeep me down, John. I thought you'd know that by now.\" \"Maybe. But how? You got a bullet through the chest and head! You couldn'tnhave survived it!\" exclaimed the chief of Precrime. Shae glanced over her shoulder in annoyance before raising an eyebrow atnthe young man in the black suit. Witwer and Michillen stared at each othernfor a short for a moment, almost glaring at one another. Danny motionedntoward Tammy and Shae, looking back to John, \"Who're they? Mynreplacements?\" \"They started here just a few weeks after your so-called death. Afterneverything that happened, many of the workers quit,\" John replied. Standing up, Shae walked in front of Danny, finding that he was only a fewninches taller than herself, \"You know, we have our own reasons for joiningnPrecrime. No reason to think we came here just to outdo you, Witwer.\" Danny narrowed his eyes, \"Have we met?\" \"My name is Agent Shae Michillen.\" \"A pleasure, I'm sure,\" Danny answered coldly, \"Well, I'm back now. Staynout of my way, Michillen.\" Shae rolled her eyes, \"It'd be best to take your own advice.\"[Chapter 3] Author's Note: O_O What's this? An actual update in this story? Ah, well. Ingot bored and thought I'd update this. I remember someone asking about hownDanny survived so I put that in this chapter. Mmph. Review! --------------------------------------------------------- \"So, tell me, Tammy.\" Shae said as she walked beside her blonde partnerntowards their offices a few weeks later, \"Did you find any information onnWitwer? How he survived that bullet through the head?\" Glancing over to Shae, Tammy silently wondered why she was so interested,n\"They found his body in John Anderton's apartment and took him to thenhospital. After a long surgery, they got both bullets out and revived him.nYou know, with all this futuristic medicine coming out, it's hard to keepnup.\" Shae didn't answer this time as she drifted into thought. She had seen thenscar from the bullet on Danny's forehead when they had first met, butnhadn't thought anything of it. Apparently, he had been through much morenthan she could ever dream of experiencing. Or so she thought. Returning her attention back to the conversation, Shae looked back tonTammy. \"Well, thanks for finding that information for me. See you around,\"nShe stopped walking when she reached her office and nodded a goodbye tonTammy. As she sat down, Shae opened a drawer and pulled out some old reports thatnshe had kept over time. For months, she had been searching for the murderernof her fiancée and as of late, she was beginning to lose hope. It was sixnyears ago. Just before Precrime had begun. She had been nineteen at thentime, fresh out of high school and attending a community college nearby.nLife had been perfect back then. She was engaged, getting perfect grades,nand had been offered a wonderful job. However, when Cole had been murdered,nshe completely lost it. Finding out who killed him was the only thing shenthought about. \"Slacking off again, Michillen?\" Danny said as he stood outside Shae'snoffice, giving her an arrogant smirk. Shae nearly yelped with surprise and turned her head to look at Danny. Whennshe saw it was only he, a scoff escaped her, \"Oh, its you. Don't you havenanything better to do than harass me? Beat it.\" \"Sorry, I don't take orders from you,\" Danny placed his hands in hisnpockets before leaning against the frame of the door, \"I can go where evernI want to.\" \"Look, I'm busy. I have no time to argue with you about where you can andncan't go.\" Danny rolled his eyes at her before grabbing one of the reports offnher desk, reading it silently. An eyebrow raised before he looked down atnher, \"What are you doing looking at old stuff like this?\" \"None of your business,\" retorted Shae. \"It certainly is. You know it's against the rules for a rookie agentnto have old reports like this. Who knows what hands it might fall into?\" \"I have my reasons to have these, Witwer. And Chief Anderton alreadyngave me his permission to have these.\" Danny chuckled as he stuck a piece of gum into his mouth. \"Just get out.\" Shae growled at him. The dark-haired man shrugged in reply before strolling away, chewingnhis gum rather obnoxiously. Shae's glare followed him until he couldn't benseen anymore and she let out a frustrated growl after he was gone. \"I somewhat wish he would have died,\" Shae thought aloud. \"He seemsnso. undignified.\" \"That's a rather vulgar thought, don't you think?\" Tammy said as shencame into her friend's office, holding a stack of paper. \"These are for younto fill out on the recent murder attempts.\" Shae sighed heavily. \"Okay. I'll work on it. Our shift in thenprediction room is in a few hours. I should be done by then.\" The blonde girl leaned up against her friend's desk, \"Listen. Younhaven't been the same. Is something bothering you?\" \".No.\" \"Does it have anything to do with Cole's death? Shae, that was a longntime ago.\" Shae shook her head, \"Look, I really need to fill these out.\" Tammy frowned in reply and slowly started to leave. \"If you ever neednto talk about it. just ask.\" \"Sure.\" Later that evening, Tammy sat near the computer by the Pre-Cog room, doingnnothing in particular. A murder hadn't happened for a while but just inncase, Tammy was ordered to sit and report if there happened to be a rednball. \"Man... This is really boring... Can't somebody think about killingnsomeone else yet?\" But sure enough, a small struggling could be heard innthe Pre-Cog room, a red ball sliding down the spiral tubes soon after. Shae looked up from her remaining paperwork before setting those files downnand sprinting upstairs to where Tammy stood. She stopped beside her andnlooked down at the struggling Pre-Cogs before glancing over to Tammy,n\"Track it...\" She sat down in a chair before looking at a list of possiblenlocations. \"Roger that. I'll try and get all the info I can. Go ahead and startnlooking at the pictures.\" With that, Tammy started with her work, movingnpictures of possible victims this way and that, trying to identify them. Chief John Anderton came rather quickly up the stairs, moving pastnDanny before moving up next to Tammy. His eyes scanned the glass screen forna moment. \"Looks to be one homicide... Good, very good. Not too much of anrun for us.\" He looked back over to Shae. \"How much information do younhave?\" \"Not much, yet.\" Danny walked casually up the stairs to help investigate the crime.nBut as soon as he saw who was in the room, a small frown formed on hisnface. \"I suggest you start looking at the information now, Michellin. Younmight let the murder slip by at the pace YOU'RE going.\" Looking at Danny, Shae scowled at him before looking back to thenscreen. \"Tams, what does the setting look like?\" \"Looks like the victim is a...\" Tammy moved a few more pictures away,nfinally landing on a match to the name the red ball came up with. \"Thisnguy's a white male, about five foot nine, and he lives in the Alderbrookenneighborhood on Baseline Street.\" \"I've got the address!\" Shae took a small piece of glass out andncopied it onto the piece before jumping to her feet. Danny leaned against the wall, shaking his head at Shae'snperformance, even though she actually had been working quite fast for a newnPre-Cop. He stuck one hand in his pocket and pulled out a small stick ofngum before throwing it into his mouth, deciding to remain quiet. Turning tonthe others, John made a motion for them to go. and go fast. \"Let's move!\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Well, we all know I don't own any of these characters exceptnfor Shae Michillen and Tam"},{"Movie":"Minority Report","Title":"Last Dance","Author":"Anya Catalyn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1978621","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: This is just a short thing I wrote during school to passnsome time. If the reviews are nice, I'll add more to it. It's a smallnromance fic for Daniel Witwer before he was involved with Pre-Crime. It wasn't unusual for Danny Witwer and I to get into arguments all thentime, considering we were total opposites. We still are in a way. Asnteenagers, we'd fight about whom did the algebra problem right, whonexplained a thesis better in an English paper and, my personal favorite,nwhich lunch of ours was worse. As usual, I was the winner by threatening tonpunch out the poor boy's brains if he decided to keep debating with menabout it. All of it seemed rather childish, especially since Danny was older than menby two months. I was sixteen at the time and Danny had just turnednseventeen. Maybe that's why I always liked to harass him. He used tonsilence me by telling me I was younger and that I'd never beat him atnanything. Then the little battles at school would start every day, leavingnmy brother and his girlfriend to just sigh, shake their heads and leave usnto our business. Like I said, we were rather childish. As much as neithernof us wanted to admit it, we had a lot of fun teasing each other aboutnanything that could get on each other's nerves. At one point, we got into ansmall fistfight and Danny, being stronger and bigger than I was, easilynpinned me down, much to my dismay. See, none of this was unusual and over time, we got closer because of it. Inlearned that Danny wasn't the quiet, intellectual, school focused boy Inthought he was. Danny also discovered I had more on my mind than theaterngames and being as loud as I possibly could be. Still, we were completenopposites who hardly ever got along. Call me crazy but I really have tonbelieve in that cliché saying that 'opposites attract'. That's for magnets,nnot people, right? Well... I believe in it anyway because eventually, Dannyngot the nerve to ask me out. Now, it wasn't one of those silly things where the boy says, \"Will you gonout with me?\" and the girl says, \"Oh yeah!\" and suddenly you're boyfriendnand girlfriend. Danny asked me out on a date and it was rather romantic ifnI do say so myself. Normally, I can do without the candlelight dinners andnseeing a movie since it's far too, well, cheesy. He knew how I felt aboutnthis, somehow, and instead, we went dancing. It was like the scene out ofnTitanic when Jack takes Rose down to the third class and they all dancenaround to the upbeat folk music. All I remember is being so thrilled andncaught up in the moment of Danny spinning me in circles. Since that time that we went out together, Danny and I had been a well-nknown couple up until the end of our senior year. We were voted as then\"Most Likely To Get Married\" couple in our class, too. Everything was goingngreat until we were at the Senior All Night Graduation Party when hendecided to spill the news to me. \"I... uh... I got my acceptance letter to St. Andrews Presbyterian College thenother day,\" Danny said while music played in the background. Raising my head from its resting spot against his chest, I knew what wasnprobably coming next. \"That's the one in Washington D.C., right? The onenclear across the country?\" Danny nodded, his eyes cast downward in guilt. \"Well, what are we supposed to do now? You said you and I were going tonstay close to each other so that we wouldn't have to deal with the longndistance relationship. What changed your mind?\" It wasn't exactly what Inwanted to say to him. In fact, I was wishing I could just pull away andnwalk out of the ballroom so I wouldn't have to hear his excuse. \"It's a good college, you know... A place where my father probably would havenwanted me to go if he were still alive.\" Danny's father was a touchy subject for him. He had been shot and killed onnthe steps of his church in Dublin, Ireland when Danny was thirteen. It wasnonly two years later that Danny moved to New York to find a better lifenwith his mother. Usually, we only talked about it if he brought up thensubject but I doubt Danny wanted to continue expressing his feelings aboutnwhat his father would have wanted. While we danced together still, I tried to think of something to say. Inwanted to say anything that would make him stay with me so that I wouldn'tnhave to fear him leaving ever. But who was I to tell him anythingndifferent? This was Danny's life, not mine. \"If you really want to go, Danny, then you should go.\" Danny raised his eyebrows, looking rather shocked. \"W-What?\" \"Hey, I happen to know you very well and I don't want to hold you back fromnanything that you want to do. All through the high school time that we'venknown each other, you've talked about being in law enforcement or a doctor.nYou've taken all the classes here to prepare you for it so just go.\" \"Shae... I don't think you realize what is going to happen if I leave.\" I rolled my eyes at this. We had just graduated and I was in the top onenhundred of my class. Somehow, he thought I didn't know much. Of course Inknew what all of this meant if the first love of my life left across thencountry. \"It means we'll have to break up.\" \"Not necessarily.\" \"Oh? Then how do you expect to maintain a firm relationship when you'renconstantly hard at work with whatever you're planning to do?\" There wasn't an easy answer for that. As hard as he searched, Dannyncouldn't find an answer to my question. At that point, I knew this was our last dance.[Chapter 2] Yearsnlater, I had grown into a spunky (if I do say so, myself) young womanncapable of handling the most intense situations. My appearance hadn'tnchanged much; I still had short, brown hair and, as people have said,nintense hazel eyes that \"bore into your soul\"... Whatevernthat means. I've made my life how I always dreamed by living on mynown in a small, one-bedroom apartment in the city. This was all afternmy years spent in an intense military-type camp to train the mind andnbody for something I really wanted to do. Pre-Crime:nThe only way to stop murders before they happen. Innocent lives arensaved everyday because the murders can be predicted by some \"gifted\"npeople called the Pre-Cogs... I think. Asnyou can see, I've done a limited amount of research for the amount ofntime I've been there. Sincenhigh school, I've avoided relationships all together to focus on myncollege education and intense training. One could say it was allnbecause of Danny Witwer that I refused to open myself up to peoplenagain, but I think otherwise. Danny was nothing more than a highnschool sweetheart that didn't have the decency to wait until afternprom night to dump me. I'm not bitter anymore, because I understandnwhy college was so important to him. It changed my life by going to anUniversity, so whatever he learned across the country had to be worthnit, right? WhennI turned twenty-two, I moved across the country as well to settle innWashington D.C. after Pre-Crime had accepted me into their program. Inwas living a life of adventure everyday, like some kind of policenmovie. But I always felt like there was something missing, and itnmight have been because I spent so much time on my own. I didn't takentime to make friends, and my coworkers were only my coworkers. Thisnchange in myself since high school caused me to shy away from peoplenand focus only on my work. I always wondered if it was because ofnDanny and my desire to somehow meet up with him again (It sounds anlittle crazy, I know), or if I just wanted to avoid getting attachednto someone and getting hurt again. Either way, it was slowly becomingna rather uneventful life outside of Pre-Crime. By day, I was ShaenMichillen, Pre-Crime officer, and class B ranking. And at night? Inwas Shae, the pretty bachelorette who was also a shut-in. What kindnof life was that for someone in their prime, anyway? Still...nI couldn't bring myself to ever accept someone into my heart again,neven if they were only a friend. Being turned away from so manynpeople in my earlier years made me realize that all people change,nand most don't accept you afterwards. So I was always prepared fornthe worst. Exceptnthat particular morning when I came into work and saw him atnin the cafeteria, getting a cup of coffee. Oh,nshit. Not here, not now... Intried to turn away quickly to avoid being seen. After all, my morningncup of caffeine and sugar could wait, so long as I didn't have tonget involved with my old flame. It had taken years to get over Dannyn(or what I thought was \"getting over\" him) and all that worknwould be put to waste if I looked at him again. My feet shuffled asnusual while I ducked down behind the crowds of workers, hoping thatnhe wouldn't catch sight of me. However, my attempts were futilenwhen I came face to face with my boss, Peter Brunson, who caught menby the shoulder and whipped me around at a dizzying speed. I blinked,nstaring at the fifty-something-year-old man, forcing an awkward andnlopsided smile. \"Yes,nsir? Good morning…\" My voice went a pitch higher with mynpoliteness as it always had. \"Are we expecting a mission today?\" Brunsonnshook his head, wrinkles forming all over his face when he smilednback at me in amusement. …Insuppose I'm funny looking? \"No,nmy dear. Actually, there is someone that I need you to meet, as henwill be joining your team and I believe getting acquainted early willnmake teamwork a bit easier for you.\" Innmy mind, I was visualizing myself slamming my head repeatedly intonthe closest table. Constantly, I was reminded that my teamwork skillsnwere not the best because I always thought that if things were donenmy way, they would be done right. Missions had almost always gonenwrong and gotten someone hurt because I was not level-headed in thenfield but because of the success, the directors of Pre-Crime kept menaround. We always caught the damn killer in time, so what was therento complain about? Well, needless to say, I never earned my Christmasnbonus due to my performance reports but did that bother me? Hell, no.nMoney is shit, anyway. Realizingnthat my boss was staring at me while my mind wandered, I let out anshort and painfully fake giggle. Luckily, he ignored it and motionednfor me to follow him out of the cafeteria and upstairs. Through thenlong corridor made of glass, the two of us came upon a rather largenoffice (not too far from my own) that had been empty for the lastncouple of months. Peter knocked on the door, and then allowed himselfnin while I peeked inside from the doorway. Boxes littered the desktopnand I could catch a glimpse of a photo frame in one of them, but wasnnot able to make out who was in it. \"DanielnWitwer, this is your new partner, Shae Michillen,\" Peter said innhis cheerful, old-man tone, stepping aside. Mynheart was suddenly caught in my throat. I couldn't breathe. Thosenadoringly beautiful blue-green eyes and that baby soft, light brownnhair that I remember running my fingers through. It was Danny,nbut he was so much older. He was well-built, stronger-looking butnstill wore that same, serious expression. Hisnhand was outstretched towards me and without hesitation; I took it,nhis warmth against my skin giving me a feeling of serenity. We shooknhands firmly and with professional expressions worn on our faces.nPeter did not seem to realize that we knew each other earlier innlife, and I think Danny, like myself, preferred to keep it that way.nI could see it in Danny's gaze- a nervousness behind it. Neithernone of us exchange words for no words came to mind for me, and Dannynwas just a stubborn man. However, the ringing of Peter's pagernsaved us from any sort of pretending we would have to do in front ofnour boss. I didn't want my history with my new partner tonjeopardize my career because of a few harmless kisses exchanged backnin high school. \"Getnto know each other well, for you will be working together closely fornquite some time,\" Peter addressed the two of us, his friendly smilendisappearing when he read the number on his pager. \"Oh, the wifendemands that I answer her calls. Excuse me, kids.\" Inwaited until Peter's footsteps were only a faint echo in thencorridor before I stepped in Danny's office completely, slammingnthe door behind me. My ears were burning, my jaw set out of angernthat he would dare come back into my life, just to torment me. Ornthat was what my mind was telling me, even though it would never bentrue. \"Daniel,nwhat the fuck are you doing here, of all the places in thenworld? You chose to barge in on my uphill climb to success! You neverncould stand the idea of me being better at something than you…\" Inseethed, the words spilling out like an uncontrollable flood. Leaningnagainst his cherry-wood desk for support, Danny crossed his arms overnhis chest and stared me down. When he looked at me that way, I alwaysnfelt smaller than him, but I wasn't about to back down. I was angrown woman now. \"Answernme, you bastard!\" Henshook his head at me, sighed and once again, locked his gaze withnmine. \"Still selfish, aren't you?\" Dannynwas watching my rage build up, provoking me to explode in front ofnhim just to prove that he still had power over me. Instead, I took inna deep breath and put my hands on my hips to hold myself higher.n\"Selfish, eh? Was I selfish when I let you go in order to go pursuenyour dreams, Danny? To stop what we had in order to allow you to bendistraction-free?\" Therenwas that awkward silence again. I refused to wait for him to come upnwith an excuse, so I turned and left his office. There were betternand more important things to do than argue with him. I made sure tonslam his door extra hard as I left, stomping down the hallway towardsnmy own office. Thatnnight, as I lay in my bed while adorned in a silk nightdress, mynhazel eyes stared at the white ceiling in wide wonder. It almostnamazed me that Danny and I had similar schooling and military-likentraining, and yet I never expected to see him again in my life. Well, I was stupid to think that way. Deep down inside me, though I'dnnever admit it aloud, I wanted to see Danny again and now that I hadnreceived my wish, I didn't know how to react. After nearly tennyears, I was still angry at him, even when I had been the one to endnour perfect relationship. All that was leftover was tears from thenaching loneliness and random bursts of rage. At least, that's how Infelt. I hadn't exactly bothered to ask the guy how he was, or wherenhe stood on martial status. Then again, Danny never struck me as thentype of guy to settle down- work always came first. Maybe that wasnwhy it had been so easy to break up… When it came to love, I wantednto come first before the love of a career. To me, one dies and allnthat hard work is for a few moments of bliss, while love lives onnforever.[Chapter 3] Afternarriving to the Pre-Crime Division central command center, I wentnstraight into the cafeteria for my beloved coffee. A small sighnescaped my lips as I stared out at the city skyline through thennearest window, one hand holding the ring on my necklace in a loosengrip. It was a simple gold band with three diamonds in it whichnrepresented love, trust and honor. When I thought back to the timenwhen I received it, butterflies would flutter in my stomach and Inwould feel momentarily happy. Maybe that was why I kept it… I justnrefused to wear it on my finger anymore. After all, he didn't waitnfor me, did he? Not like he had once promised when we first beganndating. Back when I was a lowly sophomore and he was a well appraisednsenior. Snapping back to reality with a short gasp, Indropped the coffee mug onto the ground and watched it shatter, coffeenspilling onto the floor. I felt myself stumble backwards, clenchingnthe ring even tighter in my hand. A few other workers turned and Infelt their eyes on me, either concerned or puzzled of what justnoccurred. Tammy, my co-worker and whom I actually considered to be anfriend, was standing nearby while talking with her co-agents when shenheard the breaking of glass. Jogging over to me, Tammy placed a handnon my shoulder, \"Michillen, are you all right? What's the matternwith you?\" \"N-Nothing. I'm fine. Just lost myngrip,\" I quickly lied, looking down at the broken glass. Tammy frowned. \"I see. Why don't you head upstairs? I'll getnsomeone to clean that mess up for you.\" Nodding, I leftnquickly left the staff room, embarrassed. I wasn't so nervous andnjumpy until lately. Later that morning, I stood in the darknarea where murders were predicted, \"The Temple\", sitting in mynoffice chair while looking at one particular murder I had preventednearlier. Another stabbing... Well, they hadn't prevented the rapenthat took place beforehand. One hand clenched my ring on my necklacenas I sighed in slight frustration. During this, Tammy had walkednslowly up the stairs to the Pre-Crime room, carrying what was left ofna sandwich. She finally reached the top of the stairs, seeing mensitting by myself. \"Hey Shae, Everything all right? You seem anbit dazed today.\" I jumped in surprise, letting go ofnthe ring and turning off the murder recording. \"Yeah, I'm justnfine.\" Tammy smiled weakly at me, and I knew she wasnthinking better than to ask me about what I had been looking at.nSometimes the only way to recover was to face your fears, but notnmany people knew exactly what my fear was. The blonde walked up tonthe window overlooking the three Pre-Cogs and gazed sadly down atnthem. \"You know, I always feel sorry for them... They have tonsee all these horrible murders over and over again... They can't havennormal lives like most of us...\" \"I've heardnthey've seen them all their life,\" I stood up and walked next tonher. Tammy was only trying to make conversation, so I made thendecision to humor her. \"You know, we're only using them.nSometimes, I feel guilty about working here but... You know, its onenstep closer to preventing any mishaps against innocent people.\" \"Shae, what happened to you couldn't have been prevented, younknow… It doesn't mean that you have to shut everyone out andndevote yourself entirely to your work.\" Incast Tammy a sideways glance, my expression of annoyance clear. Therenwas never a point in my life where I enjoyed being a damsel inndistress because I believed that I was strong enough to take care ofnmyself. But when people brought up \"what happened\" to me, I gotnangry because it wasn't an accident. I should have been prepared. Inshouldn't have been distracted by thoughts of Danny that night.[Chapter 4] Inran my hands through my hair out of annoyance, walking out of thenbuilding as night fell over the giant city. This part of town wasnmore old-fashioned with the hybrid cars, buses and non-movingnsidewalks. It was nice, I thought, watching twilight fall behind thenskyline. Sitting down on a bench, I waited for the sky-train thatncould take me to my apartment (the more futuristic side of town). Technology was booming in the city, as was crime, which requiredncops and detectives alike to crack down on felons. My job was alsoneasier these days, even as I was being promoted (despite my recklessnand tactless behavior). The sky-train pulled up at the stationnand I stepped on, finding it mostly empty. Thankful for an open seat,nI collapsed on to the seat and sighed. Reaching into my bag, I pullednout a book and opened it to the bookmarked page before beginning tonread it. Thenlights to the train began to show through the darkness across thendimly lit station, just ahead of where I had been. The air blew upnthe skirts to the black trench coat of a man as he stood there, thenbright lights of the train in front of him creating his shadow on thenhard wall behind him. The train slowly came to a stop, the soundnmuted from the technology onboard. The doors opened in front of thenman, signaling him to come aboard, his feet taking silent steps as henmade his way to the wide open doorframe ahead of him. Taking anslightly larger stride to get inside, he took hold of one of thensteel poles, resting casually next to it. The train was empty as thendark-haired man glanced around, his eyes resting on me where I sat innthe back. His body swayed slightly as the train began to pick up oncenmore, his dark eyes fixed on me. Pursing his lips a little, henreached up with his free hand and pulled out the cigarette that hadnbeen resting comfortably there, exhaling a small breath of smoke. Danny, shaking his head a little at the sight of his colleague,nturned away from me and faced towards the front of the train, furthernrefusing to acknowledge my presence. My work ethic at the policenstation facility was less than acceptable behavior, as I continued tonagain and again break the rules and disobey orders from higher rankednpeople, such as himself. Not that this was anything new. I hadnalways been a stubborn little girl at heart... as far back as we bothncould remember. Glancingnover to the young man that recently stepped on the train, Inimmediately recognized him. The scent of the cigarette reached overnto my side and I smiled slightly to myself, the smell bringing backnmemories. There had once been a time when we had been able to workntogether peacefully but those days were long over. Now it wasnimpossible because we were both scorned by the past. Still,nthat didn't stop me from getting up from the seat I was in andnapproaching Daniel Landis. He was trying to ignore me, I knew, but itnwas impossible to pretend like I wasn't there. I had thatnelectrifying and attractive personality. \"Are you stillnmad at me for what happened today?\" I teased him with a smirk.nYelling at him obviously did not irk the man, but my sickeninglynsweet attitude would. When he didn't reply, I grabbed the oppositenpole and childishly swung around in front of him. Dannynjumped at the sound of my voice, turning to see me standing rightnbehind him. He narrowed his eyes and then looked away once more. \"If it weren't for you, there wouldn't be thousands of dollarsnbeing spent to replace the training room you so gracefully destroyedntoday by doing something I told you not to.\" He repliednbitterly, bringing the cigarette back up to his mouth, staring at thenlights from outside move quickly past the windows. \"Well,nit's not like its coming out of your paycheck... Just mine!\" Insaid cheerfully, and then pulled back. Clearly, Danny wasn't going tonbudge and that frustrated me. Before, it was so easy to get to Landisnbut at this point, he had learned how to block me out. Sighing,nI stood up straight and stuck out my hand to him, \"Accept mynapology, will you? I'm sorry... I got carried away... again.\" Danny'snbody moved with the small movement of the train, looking to my handnreluctantly. The cigarette sat between his lips as he turned his gazenup to me through his sunglasses. Looking away again, he reachednup to his mouth and removed the cigarette. He remained speechless asnhe put it out on the steel bar before placing it in my open hand. Hendid not look back to me for a few seconds, lifting his free hand upnto his mouth and coughing a little; hiding a smile he was fightingnhard not to let show. Before I had time to react to hisnresponse, the train suddenly jolted violently, causing his arm to benwrenched from the bar he was holding onto, his body crashing into thenplastic shield in front of him before he fell back. The lightsnflickered and the train was making a very high-pitched screechingnnoise. Inhad been ready to throw the cigarette back, or even stab it in thenside of his face when the train gave a violent tremble. With a slightnyell of surprise, I stumbled over my feet and fell on the gray floor,nwincing as my hands scraped slightly from the fall. The lights wentnoff completely now, leaving them in complete darkness, which made menextremely nervous and on edge. Another lurch occurred as I tried tonstand and I fell forward again, gritting my teeth in annoyance.nScreeching to a stop, the train fell completely silent, hanging anhundred feet above the streets below in a very unsafe position. Breathing sharply, I felt forward and grabbed the nearest bar tonsteady myself. I looked out the window in nervousness, not liking thenheight that they were stuck at. What made me even more nervous wasnthe reason why they had stopped. \"Whatnhappened..?\" Danny groaned as he held his bleeding head, feelingnthe train sway a little. In the complete darkness around him, henpushed himself up from the shield in front of him and the door on hisnother side, before steadying himself, looking out the window. Thenhorizon line was at a sickening angle, meaning the train wasndangerously close to plummeting to the city. After a moment as hentried to regain a hold of himself, sounds of wires snapping in thentrain cart now above them cause the train to sway a little further. \"Shae! Where are you?!\" He called out to me, bracingnhimself against the glass. \"We need to make our way up to thenother cart! This train is going to snap at any minute!\" Allnthroughout the panic of the situation, I bet he couldn't help butnfeel this had happened on purpose... I always brought an air of badnluck... and that bad luck happened to be a crazed lunatic who wasnobsessed with me, and would stop at nothing to get to me. Again, notna memory I like to relive very often. Reachingnforward, he managed to grab onto the bar that he had originally beennholding to before pulling himself forward. \"Shae! Please tell menyou're still alive!\" He was too panicked at the moment tonrealize he was calling me by my first name... which was something henhadn't done in a long time... \"Quitnyelling. I'm fine,\" I said, leaning heavily with the tilting ofnthe train. Danny's shadow was against the opposite side of me and Inreached out, grabbing his hand. In these moments, I had realized thatnhe was calling me by my first name, which I strongly appreciated. Itngave off the effect that he still cared about me. Gripping hisnhand, I pulled him forward up on to the steps, leading him to thendoor of the next train car. I sidestepped and pushed him forward tonthe next car first. As his weight came off the leaning train, it gavenanother violent shudder and started to fall. I gasped out of surprisenand grabbed the walls, pulling myself up beside Danny. The wind wasnblowing wildly from the high elevation and I moved away from thenbroken door as quickly as possible, making sure Danny was safe fromnthe edge. I took in a sharp breath, looking around the dark trainncar, trying to find a way out of this situation. \"You okay,nDanny?\" I reached out for him again, touching his arm. \"I...nI'm fine...\" He said quietly, stepping away from me, immediatelynputting up his walls against me once more. It did not matter to himnthat I had just helped save his life... For some reason, it only madenhim feel worse about the situation. He felt the guilt inside of himngrow, but he was not willing to bring me back into his life. \"Wenneed to get to a hospital. I'm going to check the rest of the trainnto see if anyone else was onboard.\" His eyes met with minenfor a few moments, old feelings rushing back to him from their pastntogether. He didn't want to be apart from me, but no matter how muchnhis heart yearned for my affection and comfort, his ego was not readynto give up. Tearing his eyes away from my gaze, he held his arm andnstarted to walk towards the exit of the train, in hopes there was anway to get off as soon as possible. Inrecoiled, looking out the window as Danny left me. Things seemednpeaceful for the moment and I could catch my breath after narrowlynescaping a plummet to my untimely death. However, my relaxation wasnshort lived when the train groaned loudly and it started moving againnbut at this point, they were moving backwards. Instead of going tonsearch for Danny, I turned around to look at the open door that lednto the outside. Was I stupid enough to try something like that? Well,nduh. Running to where the open door was, I poked my head out andnsaw the ladder that lead to the roof of the train car. I inhalednsharply then reached around, grabbing the bars and pulling herself upnon to the ladder. Up I went, pausing when the train would violentlynlurch on the track until I had made it to the roof. If I could get tonthe driver, I might be able to stop it. I crouched low to the groundnas I moved, careful not to lose my footing with these shudders of thenmoving object.

It was 12:43nAM by the time the credits had finished rolling. You may be wondering whynthey were still there throughout the entire list of names involved in then70 minute film. Well the world may never know. By then the multiplex wasnall but dead. There were a few stragglers remaining, a few coming out ofnthe theater with them, although most had gone out the side door to thenparking lot. There was a special 1:00 AM screening of \"The Two Towers\"nbefore they sent it packing from their theater after 5 months. So therenwere a few Ringnuts at the concession stand with one person working it, annusher was sweeping up in the corner by the men's room. Little did he knownhe'd soon have a lot more to clean up and I don't mean the huge mess thenaforementioned group of friends left behind in the theater. A little old lady was sitting, waiting for her husband to come out ofnthe bathroom, while a local hobo slumbered away on the bench adjacent tonher. Beyond that, everyone had gone home. The group of teenagers wasnbasically on a major sugar high from too many pixie sticks and a lot ofnfree refills of Frozen Coke. But they weren't normally too much trouble,nexcept when it came to going to movies. They had had an enjoyable night andnmade a lot of new inside jokes, they wanted to remember their fun when Xuannnoticed the photo booth over by the front door and the arcade, and reactednas if she'd never seen it there before although they went to the samentheater almost every weekend. \"OH MY GOSH YOU GUYS WE SO HAFTA CRAM INTO THAT PHOTO BOOTH!\"nExclaimed Xuan. \"Are you crazy...wait don't answer that we already know.\" Mike replied. \"Xuan that's designed for two to three people, besides we hafta getnhome\" Brittany tried. \"Sissy! Besides, rules are meant to be broken come on, it'll be fun.nI'll make us fit!\" Xuan belted. \"Why don't you just take a picture with someone's phone?\" Michaelanasked her. \"Because this'll be more fun; besides camera phones suck! Just likenthe Tigers\" Xu told her. \"Well tell us something we don't know,\" said Kish. \"Alright, Xu if it means that much to you I'll go with you, anyonenelse?\" said Mike. No one else seemed to react as Xuan pulled Mike by his hood over tonthe photo booth. But eventually Brittany and Josh followed in suit, leavingnKish, Michaela and Steve waiting for them. \"Let's go wait in the car, this is just stupid\" said Michaela \"Yeah maybe we should just drive off without them,\" replied Steve. And with that they were off, out the front door to wait in the hoopty rignin the parking lot. Leaving the others to their impending photo-finish...[Chapter 2] Photo Booth Chapter 2: All Hell Breaks Loose, and some other stuff happensntoo... Well apparently Irina had been left out of the whole thing by bothngroups. The \"photo booth people\" went one way, the \"car people\" wentnanother and everyone left her behind. Not miffed in the least, she decidednto amuse herself by taunting the sleeping hobo on the bench, now abandonednby the old woman who had gone off to her old lady dreams, and to change hernDepends. But as Irina made her way towards that side of the Lobby, Fisk,nanother one of their friends who was supposed to go with them but nevernshowed up or said a word, came out of the Theaters 1-5 corridor. \"WHOO HOO! THAR SHE BLOWS!\" Fisk exclaimed upon seeing Irina andnsneaking up on her. Irina jumped at least three feet in the air from thenstartle, and fought back, \"ARGH! Fisk? Where the hell were you? And why did you do that younpiece o' shit?\" \"I couldn't watch that movie, it's completely against my religion...toonmany uses of the F-Bomb, kind of like you except compared to you it shouldnbe rated G,\" Fisk replied. \"So does that mean I go against your religion? Oh wait...that's kind ofnobvious I'm mean... it's me,\" Irina said. NOW that I have your attention, back to the action in the PhotonBooth, we'll rewind a few frames and pick it up as the four of them (that'snMike, Xuan, Josh and Brittany) first attempt to cram themselves into thentiny booth. It has now become painfully obvious that it wasn't evenndesigned for 2 people, more like one and a half people. Xuan decided firstnoff that she would be the first to go in, everyone else refused as shencould easily be the last one to come in. So they shoved Mike and Josh innfirst, then Brittany had to sit on their laps. Mike was already squishednagainst the wall as it was, and Josh was hanging off of the seat and out ofnthe curtain. Xuan prepared to enter. Why they were all putting up with thisnwas beyond me. \"ALL ABOARD! I'm comin in!\" Xuan yelled as she prepared to leapnthrough the curtains. But just as she became airborne and flew through the curtains thencamera went off without anyone instructing it to. And with the flash, Xuanndisappeared in mid-air, leaving everyone else stunned. \"What the hell?\" Mike yelled. But they wouldn't have very long to ponder this very eloquently putnquestion as all of a sudden the 1812 Overture began to play, annoyingly. Itndidn't take long for Mike to realize this was his phone ringing and notnsome mysterious orchestra from the great beyond. The ringing continuednunanswered. \"You gunna answer that Mike?\" Josh persisted. \"I don't know who it is...\" Mike replied. \"Ever heard of Caller ID?\" Brittany asked. \"Oh yeah...Caller unknown,\" he said after checking the screen. \"Maybe it's Xuan, answer it anyway,\" Brittany said. \"Yeah where the hell did she go?\" Josh asked. \"Maybe she went to the bathroom and we're all just seeing things ornimagining that she disappeared in a giant flash of light.\" Mike tried asnthe phone kept ringing incessantly. \"ANSWER THAT!\" the others insisted. \"FINE!\" Mike answered the phone to dead air. He tried to say hellonrepeatedly, but still nothing. He was getting extremely pissed and wasnabout to hang up as the anonymous caller finally responded. \"Good afternoon and welcome to Star Theaters Tele-Ticketing service.nFor a list of showtimes press 1, to purchase tickets for today's featuresnpress 2, to purchase advance day tickets press 3...\" it said almost like anmachine, although you could still tell it was a real person. \"What the shit are you talking about? Xuan is this some kind ofnjoke?\" Mike asked. \"No this is no joke and I'm definitely not named Schwann,\" the voicenreplied.

She didn't know how it felt to have two secure arms around her, arms that should feel like home. She didn't know where her home is, but she felt homesick. She was never the kind of girl whose entire life revolved around love and boys, but she was still a girl. She wanted to feel safe and warm in arms of a boy. She turned eighteen and she had never had a boyfriend. She was never close enough with a boy that could develop into something more than just frienship. She didn't even have many friends, and she avoided meeting new people. In fact, she avoided people she knew, too. This was one of those days when she wasn't happy with who she was. That she was so shy and reserved, and built up walls around her. Around a year ago, at her prom, she was closest to a guy. But it wasn't just a guy. It was the guy. The guy she's been crushing on even before she knew about love. The guy that made her feel butterflies in her stomach just by thinking about him, and the one that drove her crazy just when she heard his name. That night at the prom was perfect to her. She imagined it's how heaven looks like. But as she was high in the clouds that night, she fell to the hard ground the next day. She thought her and Gavin's relationship would change after that night. But she walked to school the next day and he acted like nothing happened, so she got scared. Maybe she misunderstood his signals. She didn't really know much about love and how it works, after all. He acted towards her like to a friend. She accepted that her hopes were too high. Right after he broke through her walls, she built them up again. Which resulted in her not being really talkative in any conversation Gavin tried to start with her. Short conversations, mostly about music, is where it was. She wished it wasn't like that. Most of the time when they talked, she couldn't even look at him. She desired him so much, and she was afraid she'll tell him her feelings for him at the spot if she looks at him. And she was sure that would ruin the little of the 'friendship' she had with him, and she didn't want that. She liked secretly enjoying his company. She liked how some days his dark shiny hair was a bit spiked, and on other days he let his curls fall on his forehead. It drove her crazy. Every little thing about him did. After they graduated, they didn't lose contact, considering Tara had a show at Slam FM, a building that Gavin visited often with his band. Besides owning Slam's radio station, Rob was also owned a label, and signed The GGGGs to his label. They were practicing and recording their songs at Slam almost every day. They occasionally had a break, and you could almost always find Gavin by the coffee maker. Which is usually Tara's favorite spot too, right after her studio. They were still talking only about music, and occasionally throwing a joke into the conversation. Gavin and his band were also guests on her show few times during that time. Even though that was Rob's order so people get to know the band, Tara didn't mind doing the thing she likes the most while looking at a guy she likes. She realized that her chances with him are lower than zero. She sighed while laying on her bed in complete silence, looking up at the ceiling, the only sound was the sound of voices inside her head, while her writing notebook and pen were by her side. Few streets away, the boy Tara couldn't get out of her head was laying on his bed, too. His mind filled with thoughts intertwining each other. He was looking up at the ceiling with his guitar next to him. He was never a fan of Valentine's Day. He believed that a day with a loved one should be celebrated every day, not only one day a year. The problem was, he didn't have his loved one. He completely blamed himself for it. He ran his hand through his hair in frustration he felt towards himself. He has had a few girlfriends before, but he never considered any of them a real girlfriend. He didn't believe in any of his relationships so far. But he believed in one that didn't actually exist. He was so close to having her that night at prom, but he got too scared the next day to make a move and just ask her if she wants to be his. He was too nervous, so he avoided her most of the day. He didn't want to ruin the friendship they've built over the last few months. She made him so nervous, just her presence did. He was so afraid he'll do something stupid and embarrass himself in front of her. He had the tendency to do that in front of girls anyway. He knew that the only thing he can't screw up at is music, so he kept going on about it while he kept telling himself to pick up some courage and ask Tara out. He was close to it so many times, but whenever he looked at her, he couldn't do it. The nervousness was back. She was too perfect for him. Every little thing about her was. How sometimes her hair covered her eye and he had to fight back the urge to push it behind her ear. Or how she always had a tiny smile while she was talking. Sometimes he couldn't stop starting at her lips. The ones he desired so much. But he was scared that she'll reject him. He thought he wasn't good enough for her. He looked at the guitar next to him. He knew what to do. And he had to do it. He put on his jacket, took his guitar and left his house. In Tara's house, she just left her room and walked down into the kitchen to get herself a glass of water. She was alone because Rob took her mom to dinner. Tara looked out of the window. It was already nighttime. She didn't realize time has passed so fast. She was on her way back to her room when she heard a knock on the door. She walked to it and automatically opened it without checking who is it first. To her surprise, the person now standing in front of her was someone she'd least expect to see there, but it couldn't make her happier that he was there. Gavin was looking back at her with a special shine in his eyes. They stared into each other's eyes for few seconds. No one said a word, but then Tara broke the eye contact to look at Gavin's guitar. He looked down at it too, stood up straight, put his fingers on the right chords and started strumming while looking at Tara, focusing on her eyes which covered him with calmness. \"ohhh, girl, how do I say to you how I feel? how do I explain my heart to you which you steal, every time you look at me and you take my breath away, I have a question to ask you, if I may..\" Gavin took a deep breath and looked at his fingers on the chords, then he switched them to different ones. He looked back at Tara, more determined than he felt about anything before. He started strumming again. \"your eyes' brightness makes my world shine, Tara Adams, will you be mine?\" Gavin said the last words more talking than singing. He stopped strumming and looked at Tara with his eyebrows raised, patiently waiting for the answer. It hasn't even been a second but to him it felt like an era. Tara was so shocked and surprised that she just stood there, staring at him. So many thoughts were going through her mind. One was that she's obviously going to wake up any second. She started pinching herself, not moving her eyes from his. \".. Tara?\" Gavin said quietly, getting more worried with every moment that passed and he didn't get an answer. \"Huh?\" Tara snapped out of it, and looked at Gavin. She still believed it was a dream, until Gavin slowly reached for her hand. His hand was cold because he was nervous and he was standing outside in the winter without gloves, but Tara didn't mind. She loved the gentle touch, and her hand in his. She felt something she's been wanting to feel for a long time. They moved closer to each other slowly, not breaking the eye contact. Gavin noticed a smile creeping from the corner of Tara's lips. It made him smile too. This was a good sign. Tara then nodded. Then she looked at Gavin, and nodded again. At this moment Gavin couldn't explain how happy he was. He just wanted to grab her and spin her around in happiness, and holds her tightly in his arms for the rest of their lives. They went in for a hug when they were stopped by the guitar between them. They both laughed at their dorkness. Gavin moved the guitar so it rested on his back, which gave him more access to Tara. He walked closer to fill the space between them. She was like gravity to him. Gavin put one of his hands on Tara's cheek, and let the other slide around her waist and rest on her lower back. He carefully pulled her against him. At the same Tara put her hands lightly on his shoulders. They didn't break their eye-contact. Gavin slowly started leaning in towards her lips. Tara then looked at his lips coming closer. She felt those butterflies in her stomach. It was getting worse when she felt his warm breath lightly hitting her face. The next moment she already felt his soft lips gently pressed to hers. Her lips froze. She didn't know what to do. She has never kissed before. What if she messes it up. She then pressed her lips back to his and puckered them a bit against his lips, hoping for the best. She felt Gavin smiling against her lips, so she smiled too. A second after that Gavin's lips brushed off and away from hers softly, and they looked at each other again. This time, their eyes had something different in them. It was the fire ignited from the love that was born between them. Neither of them couldn't stop smiling. Tara broke the silence. \"Do you, uh.. Wanna come in?\" she asked hopefully. Gavin nodded immidiately, then walked inside when Tara stepped to the side to let him in. She followed him inside and closed the door behind them. They never planned on spending another Valentine's Day without each other.

First time Radio Rebel writer, long time Atticus Mitchell lover! I've already written a My Babysitters A Vampire Benny/OC fic titled Don't Call Me Babe. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF IT?! Also a sequel, Call Me Aria that is out now and updated weekly! GO READ THEM! You know, after you read this of course... DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN RADIO REBEL OR ATTICUS MITCHELL. If I did I would lock him up and cuddle him forever. And probably do unmentionable things to him. So yeah. I heard the start-up of the song, a guitar playing. But it wasn't the song Gabe and I agreed on. It was... Oh no. here we go Caught me sneaking out the back. Daddy chased me down the street. Good thing I've been running track He'll ground me till I'm 83! Oh man. The memories came flooding in. Our first time. \"Samantha! Get back here!\" My dad yelled as he ran after me. \"Later dad!\" I called behind me, laughing. He wouldn't be able to catch me. Mom had the car, and unbeknownst to her, he was high off his ass. Besides, I'm on the track team. I run every day! But I knew when I came back I would be so dead. My mom would be slightly forgiving, if my dad didn't push her to ground me until I started college. Gonna meet up with my homies! Party like we're VIP's. You'll be glad to say you know me Satisfaction guaranteed! So rock with us tonight! \"Sammy! There's my favorite girl.\" Gabe smiled, putting an arm around my shoulders and pressing a swift kiss to my temple. \"Hey Gabe. Hey guys.\" I said, giving a small, happy wave to the other G's and their friends. \"Did you have any trouble with your dad?\" Gabe asked, concern hinting in his otherwise smooth voice. \"A little.\" I sighed \"he chased me down the street, but hey, I run track.\" We chuckled \"besides, mom was out, so he couldn't chase me down with the car. I lost him like two and a half blocks ago. I went down towards the pizza shop and turned back down an alley. He's probably all the way downtown by now!\" I laughed. Gabe laughed too \"that's my girl!\" He nuzzled my face. \"Now, c'mon, we have a party to attend.\" He smiled, taking my hand. We so, Fly! We so, Fly! We so, Fly! We is, oh, we is! We so... Fly. We so... Fly. At the party, we danced with the other people to a fast, thumping song. I grinded on Gabe, his chest pressed strong against my back. His hands kept hold of my bare waist. As we danced, the fringe on my bralet/crop top flew wildly, and my layered necklaces bounced around on my chest. \"You look amazing.\" He said in my ear. I looked up at him, a teasing look on my face \"You just like how much skin I'm showing.\" I teased. \"Mmmm.\" He moaned in agreement, his lips ghosting on my neck. \"Of course I do.\" He started to suck on my neck. Oh, he knew that was my weak spot. I turned around and pressed my body against his, wrapping my arms around his neck. \"Don't tease me unless you plan on facing up to what you started.\" I warned in his ear. \"Then let's find somewhere to go.\" Gonna wait until it's dark. If the neighbors only knew Creepin' in your backyard We'll cannonball into the pool! \"You sure your parents aren't home?\" I asked smiling as we snuck into Gabe's backyard. \"Yeah, they're out at some work thing. They won't be back until way late.\" He assured me. I giggled, as we walked around the pool. I eyed the dark water, and looked at Gabe. He was looking at me, a mischievous smirk on his face that I'm sure mirrored my own smile. He left for a moment, and the lights in the pool turned on, illuminating the clear water and making the blue pop. I took off my jewelry, my many necklaces and bracelets, and my shoes and socks. As a last thought, I took out the four stud earrings in my ears and set it all on a small glass table. Arms wrapped around my waist and Gabe's bare chest pressed against my back. \"Let's go.\" He murmured against the side of my neck. I spun around and we smirked at each other. Taking his hand, we ran towards the pool and jumped, cannonballing into the pool together. I surfaced, laughing and wiping water from my face. Gabe popped up next to me and flashed me a smile. He wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me close, pressing a kiss to my lips. He pulled away and looked me in the eyes. \"Sam, there's been something I've been wanting to ask you.\" \"What is it?\" \"Will you go to prom with me?\" I bit my lip, trying to hold back a smile. It didn't work. \"Yes!\" I cheered, hugging him, then pulled back to give him an excited kiss. I pulled back, and we stared into each other's eyes before slowly going in for another kiss. This time it was slow and meaningful. I opened my mouth and let him in. Our tongues pushed together, and I let him explore around my mouth. Then we'll party back at your place. You don't even understand We'll be drowning out the DJ Yeah we'll scream until we can't. So rock with us tonight! We broke apart and watched each other. Then, we came at each other, kissing with an unquenchable passion, touching each other everywhere. I couldn't keep my hands off of him. Somehow, we managed to make it out of the pool without drowning or stop kissing. Gabe pulled away regretfully and said in a deeper tone \"let's go.\" Breathless, I nodded and allowed him to pull me into his house and upstairs to his room. He pushed me down onto his bed and got on top of me and we started to make out again. In the heat of the moment, I said \"We're going to get your bed all wet.\" Gave continued to kiss my neck and said \"So?\" I gently pushed him off me, and sat up. Softly, I said \"So.\" and looked into his eyes. I could see it click and his eyes widened a little. \"Are you... Are you sure?\" He asked hesitantly. I bit my lip and nodded. \"Yes. I'm ready. I couldn't hear the rest of the song as blood rushed through my ears, and the whole experience came flashing back. I unbuckled Gabe's pants while he unzipped the back of my top. I felt the shirt open up in the back and slide forward a little. I got Gabe's pants undone and he worked on mine, simply just pulling them down. \"Cute panties.\" He chuckled. I looked down at the hot pink lace cheeky panties trimmed in black lace, good thing I wore cute panties today. \"I'm glad you like my panties.\" I giggled. \"I'd like them better on the floor.\" Gabe whispered, his voice husky. \"Then fix the problem.\" I whispered in his ear, nipping at his earlobe. He growled, a low sexy tone, and my shirt and underwear soon joined the rest of our clothes on the floor. I gasped and winced, feeling a tearing/pinching feeling as Gabe slid into me. I pulled on his hair, letting out a breathy moan as the pain turned into pleasure. \"Are you okay?\" Gabe asked. I nodded \"keep going.\" He smiled and did so. It felt strange, feeling him move inside me, but fantastic at the same time. His hands roamed my body, sliding up my thighs and along my stomach, toying with my breasts. I felt along his chest, his muscles lean and hard against my smaller hands. He toyed with my body, each touch like a flame of passion. We kissed and not long after, it was over in a burst of ecstasy. My memories faded along with the last chords of the song. Gabe was staring right at me, a victorious smirk on his face. He thought he had done something right, something good. I bit my lip, glaring, as I tried not to let the threatening tears spill over. I felt one fall down my cheek, and Gabe's smiling face turned to one of confusion. I turned and ran into the house, needing to get out of here and away from him. I heard him yell my name \"Sam! Sam! Samantha, dammit, slow down!\" He caught my arm and forced me to a stop \"Sam, what's your deal?\" \"What's my deal? What is your deal?!\" I yelled \"that wasn't the song we agreed on for you to play tonight!\" \"I thought you liked that song!\" He said his voice high. \"I liked it when it was just me and you listening to it! Gabe, that song is personal , it's about you and me and our first time, and nobody else needs to know our life!\" My voice cracked a little. Gabe sighed, aggravated \"I don't see why you're so worked up. I mean, it's just one song . You're just making a big deal out of nothing.\" \"I should be making a big deal! What we did was supposed to be private!\" \"So you're saying having sex with me was a mistake?\" Gabe accused angrily. \"What? I didn't even say that!\" \"But you implied it! You think that us having sex was something to be ashamed of!\" \"I can't deal with you right now, Gabe! You took something private, something important to me, and let the whole world know about it! Why can't you see that?\" I yelled, tears brimming in my eyes again. \"Why can't you see that it's not a big deal?!\" He yelled back. \"It is a big deal! You've just got your head so far up your rock star ass to notice anything but yourself!\" \"I knew it! I knew this had to do with how popular I am now! You're just jealous I'm more popular than you! God, you are so pathetic.\" Oh my god. I can't believe he just said that. \"I'm pathetic? Fuck you, Gabe. We're done.\" I snapped, glaring at him and turning away. \"Fine!\" He yelled after me \"You just lost the best thing you ever had! Good luck finding anyone half as good as I am!\" \"Come on Sammy, you gotta go to Morp with me! You've been all sad and depressed for a week.\" My best friend Rachel begged \"I know it sucks that you and he-who-must-not-be-named broke up, but you can't let it bring you down!\" I sniffled, peeking my head out from under my comforter. \"I never dated Voldemort.\" I joked weakly. Rachel smiled wide \"There's my Sammy! I've been wondering where the hell you've been! Now, let's get you dressed up for Morp!\" She pulled me out of bed and towards my closet \"Do you have anything to wear?\" I studied my closet, thinking. Then something came to mind. \"I just might.\" I grabbed Rachel's hand and dragged her out of my room, down to the basement, and into a room that held stuff nobody used. I went to the closet and opened it up, coughing slightly at the musty smell. I pulled a dress off the rack and showed it to Rachel. \"Oh. My. God. That is perfect!\" She squealed \"go upstairs and put it on!\" I looked at myself in the mirror. Rachel had curled my hair, leaving it down so the curls came down to my shoulders. Then she dusted purple eye shadow on my eyelids, lining them with black eyeliner and swiping mascara on my lashes. The dress itself was a light purple satin, with a darker purple tulle underskirt. It was strapless and had little pyramid studs on the bodice. I paired it with black lace-up wedges and kept my jewelry simple; just a pair of large hoop earrings. I painted my nails a sparkly purple while Rachel was getting ready. \"We're going to have the BEST time at Morp, even if we don't have dates!\" Rachel cheered. \"You mean Garret still hasn't asked you?\" I asked. Garret was a part of the G's. He played drums, and I knew he had been crushing on Rachel since the eighth grade, and vice versa. \"No, he hasn't.\" She sighed \"But I will not give up hope! Garret will be mine by the end of the night!\" I gave her a concerned look \"Do I even want to know what you have planned?\" \"Probably not all the details, but if my parents ask, I'm sleeping over at your house tonight.\" I gasped, giggling \"Rachel Lee Williams! Is that kind of activity appropriate for a young lady of your age?\" I teased. \"Oh shut up you whore!\" She giggled back \"I know you aren't a virgin!\" We laughed and teased each other until it was time to go. Morp was rather eventful. Everyone found out who Radio Rebel was, the sweet shy girl who never spoke, Tara. I guess it should have been obvious, you know, since she was the last person anyone would have suspected to be Radio Rebel. She almost got expelled, but everyone began yelling that they were Radio Rebel. Since Principal Marino couldn't expel us all, Tara was let off scot-free. Gabe was crowned Morp king and Radio Rebel - Tara - was crowned Morp queen. Gavin performed a super sweet song for Tara, and the rest of the G's joined him onstage to help with the song. I knew that Gavin had quit the band, so maybe this meant Gabe had finally quit his asshole rock star attitude? I would find out that answer, because Gabe found me after Gavin's song. \"Sam, can we talk?\" He asked sheepishly. \"I've got nothing to say to you, Gabe.\" I said stubbornly, turning away. \"No wait, Sam.\" He grabbed my wrist and turned me back towards him \"Don't be like this. Just listen to me!\" I tore my hand away \"You broke my heart Gabe! Why should I listen to you? You were an asshole.\" \"I know I was an asshole.\" He admitted \"I know I was a jerk, and I know I deserved you leaving me. I just want you to know that... Well, I'm sorry.\" I knew that must have been hard for him. Gabe's pride made it hard for him to apologize to anyone. \"I let my dreams get to my head because they were finally starting to come true, and then I realized I had lost the most impost rang thing to me, more important than becoming a famous band - you. I also realized that you were the one thing keeping me going and making sure I don't stop until I reach the top. But I don't want all that unless\" he took my hands in his \"I can do it with you.\" My heart melted. I could see in his green eyes that he meant every word. I sighed, smiling \"I believe you Gabe. Apology accepted.\" We hugged and I kissed his cheek \"To be honest, I was kind of lost without you. I'm sorry I freaked out on you. But next time you write a song about our sex life, ask me first before performing it in front of everyone we know!\" He laughed, knowing I was only joking. Well, mostly. \"I will next time, Sammy. So, wanna go to Morp with me?\" I laughed this time \"Thought you'd never ask.\" He took my hands and we swayed back and forth to the music. \"Oh, by the way, you might want to give Garret some condoms or something. Rachel has something planned for him tonight that probably involves sex.\" \"Lucky him. Do I get anything tonight?\" Gabe asked with a smirk. I smirked back \"If you play your cards right, big boy.\" AN: So, you guys like? I really wanted to write something for Radio Rebel and this was it!

I was expecting a lot more! C'mon, Radio Rebel fans, start writing! For the ones who read my other stories, don't worry, none of them are abandoned! All of them will get plenty of updates this summer! So...On with the story! I couldn't believe it. It was our song. On the radio. Radio Rebel was playing our song. That could only mean one thing: we were going to become famous for real! At first, I was really excited. It was my voice, on the radio. Everyone could hear me. It was pretty much the best moment of my life, so far. But I had to wonder...How was it possible? How did Radio Rebel get the song? And, of course, the question everybody was asking: Who was that girl? I approached Gavin as soon as I saw him, at school. I could see he was pretty much as happy as I was. \"By the look on your face, I'm guessing you heard it too.\" I said as he kept smiling. \"How did that happen?\" \"I don't know, I'm just as shocked as you are!\" Gavin answered, but his expression didn't change. He was obviously very happy and I had a feeling it was for reasons different than mine. Suddenly, a look of realization appeared on his face. I stared at him in expectation but he didn't say anything. \"Gavin? You know something?\" \"It was Tara!\" I stared at him, puzzled. The name didn't ring a bell. \"You know, the girl I'm working with for drama class.\" \"Oh, the one with reddish hair?\" Gavin nodded with a smile. I slowly nodded back, wanting to know more about that girl. \"Yeah. She probably gave our demo to her stepdad who gave it to Radio Rebel.\" \"Oh, I thought you meant she was Radio Rebel.\" I really wanted to know who this Radio Rebel was. I mean, she played our song on the radio, I had to know who was this girl who wanted to make us famous. Then, I realized something. \"Wait, how did she get our demo? Weren't you the one keeping it?\" \"Well, I-\" I could tell he was getting nervous and I didn't let him finish. \"Gavin, you have to be more careful with the band's stuff!\" I said in an accusing tone. \"What would have happened if someone else took it and-\" It was Gavin's turn to interrupt me. \"I'm really not in a mood for a fight, Gabe.\" I could hear a hint of guilt in his voice and I felt kinda bad, but not enough to change my attitude. \"Can't we just be happy that Radio Rebel likes our music enough to play it and call it inspiring?\" I couldn't help but smile a little. \"I suppose you're right. But I still wanna know who she is.\" \"Trust me, everybody does. But she wants to keep it a secret, and we should respect that. I didn't like this answer. I had to know. \"Anyway, I'll talk to Tara later to see if my theory's right.\" \"Whatever.\" Later, at lunch, I saw Gavin talking with that girl, Tara, and I just had to listen to their conversation. Oh oh, Gavin was acting non-professional. I had to talk to him about it later. Who was this girl who made him say all that stuff? From what I could tell, she was kinda weird. I never spoke a word to her in my whole life and I could tell she was as shy as they get. Yep, there was no way that someone like her could be Radio Rebel. But you never know. She could very well use her alter ego to say everything she wanted to say, without being judged. Crazy, right? But it was a possibility for sure. When school was over, I saw Tara walking away. She seemed in a hurry and I decided to follow her. Yeah, she might not be Radio Rebel, but she could still lead me to her. I had to be careful so she wouldn't notice I was following her. I had no idea if she actually knew me, but the whole school pretty much did, so I couldn't let her see me. She started going faster and so did I. But I was being careful, so she didn't notice me. I wondered if she was too deep in thought or if I was just that good. I noticed the 'Who is Radio Rebel?' posters all around the place. I had no idea, but I wanted to know so badly. She suddenly stopped, taking me by surprise. I hid behind a tree and looked in the direction she was looking. There were two weird guys who looked like they were spying someone and weren't doing a good job at it. Dorks. Tara did her best to avoid them and I knew then for sure that the girl had something to hide. She changed her way and I quickly followed her, close enough to see her every action but far away enough not to get caught. She entered SLAM through the back. This was it. I was going to find out whether she was Radio Rebel or not. I quickly made my way to the door after she had closed it. As I opened the door, I saw big, brown, terrified eyes staring at me.

Radio Rebel Fanfiction. Gabe and Audrey. Pretty sure i'm the first person to write one of these. So lets get this started. Audrey's Pov: I was walking trough the hall with my BFFTLEWE, Tara. \" My mom is taking me to the mall to get more streaks in my hair. I'm want to get pink but I want more than just pink. How about yellow. Yep yellow is on the list. But I want more. How about purple and pink or blue and pink or red and pink. I want my hair to be like a rainbow. Like a color paradise. Or a color poltergeist. Maybe not. A poltergeist is way to scary. I like the rainbow better. Oooo why don't I just get a rainbow streak. So when I wake up in the morning there will always be a rainbow there. People will be complimenting it alot. Like you and Stacey\". I said Quickly. \"Cool but I don't think Stacey will talk to us. Since. You know. The Morp\" Tara said silently. \" Yeah. She totally betrayed and tricked us. She didn't even mean it when she said she was Radio Rebel. She just wanted the crown. Now back to my hair\" I said Tara giggling at my change of subject. All of sudden I ran my face right into somebody's back and fell to the ground with a thud. Dirty mop water spilled all over me even in my mouth. When my vision came back there was no surprise by who it was considering they didn't apologize.[Chapter 2] Gabe's Pov I just got out of 1st period and I went to catch up with Gavin. \" You know what rockstars do\" I asked Gavin. \" What?\" He said sounding kinda annoyed. I turned to walk backwards. \" This\" I said sounding cool. \" So you and Tara still going out cause I heard there are alot of cute babes coming next semester. I can score you one if you would like\" I smirked. \" Yes I am and no thanks. You should get a REAL girlfriend yourself besides your going to get over the fact i'm dating Tara anyways\". Gavin smiled like he was enjoying my annoyance at the fact he was dating Tara. He is so manipulative with his words. No wonder she's into him. \" Whatever\". I said crashing into someone hearing a loud thud behind me. I turned around and saw at wet Audrey giving me the death stare. Then my eyes shifted to the empty mop bucket. \"Oops\" I said staring down at her. ","Summary":" Author: Simple. Radio Rebel Fanfiction. Gabe and Audrey.

We both me and rebel got a minus in participation, you can't give us a minus for who we are..\" My twin says\" So since grades are being handed out we are giving us all at Linken Bay High an F for labelling each other, Jocks, Outcastes, Dorks, Queen-bees and their fellow pops and new born pops\" I look over at my sister Tara \"Guys these are all labels, not who we really are, once upon a time being different was a good thing, now those difference aside us, you deserve to embrace your awesomeness, reject the status quo\" Me and Tara look at each other. \" We dare you!\" Hi my name is Mara Adams and I have a twin sister called Tara. I have neon blue and purple hair that goes to my mid back and ice blue eyes that you can get lost in well that is what my friends and sister say. Me and Tara and the hottest DJ's in Seattle but you never believe it because we are very shy and only have three friends. I never new that my life will be turn upside down. Next day at school \"Ok last night the Radio Rebels..\" Audrey started \"Were awesome!\" Tara finished \"As usual, reject the status quo is now my new life motto, their both so inspiring, so...themselves\" Audrey says as she shoves a red lollipop into her mouth. Tara sighs as I roll my eyes at Audrey. \"I wish I can be more like them\" Tara says as she looks around I nod in agreement. \"You two should talk to you stepdad\" Audrey states that make me and Tara fling are heads around. \"What!? why!?\" We say at the same time as well as slamming are locker door's shut. \"Er he runs SLAM FM the biggest music station in Seattle\" She says in a 'duh' tone. Again I roll my eyes at her. \"Maybe he could give you two an internship that will be a confidents boost right?\" Tara shook her head. \"Are you kidding me! He's been married to my mum for what two months? He probably thinks I'm a total step-freak\" She says looking down I nod in agreement. \"I freak out when he asks what kind of cereal I want\" I say as Audrey closes her locker and we start to walk to class. \"I wish I could talk to everyone like I talk to you two. I guess that's why you guys are my BFF's or BSF's\" Tara says hugging her books like me. Audrey stops and looks at us. \"You mean BFFTLEWE\" We give her a 'what the' look. \" You know Best Friends For Totally Like Ever Without Exeption \" Audrey explains in yet another 'duh' tone. \"Catchy\" I say as we start walking again. \"You two try my new relaxation technique, when I'm memorizing lines for drama I imagine that I'm breathing in the words\" Audrey dramatically states. \"Audrey what does that even mean!\" I pointed out. She just let in a deep breath. \"You need to breath...\" She says breathing out but takes another breath in \"..Your words\" she added but she sounded like she was going to pass out but never. \"How can you breath at a time like this!\" Barry mentioned as he pushed us. I roll my eyes for the what sixteenth time today. \"Problem Barry?\" Audrey asks. \"Last night the Radio Rebels revealed the biggest clue yet about their identities they go to our school\" Barry says while walking backwards facing us then walking forwards again. \"They mentioned it at 14:30 on Tuesday nights podcast\" Larry suddenly says as he get into the lift. \"Wow obsessed much Larry\" Audrey said as she, me and Tara get into the lift. \"Obsessed? please! I-I would hardly describe myself as obsessive\" He says as he mutters obsessive, takes a wet wipe out of his pocket, wipes the up button then presses it. We all give him the 'really' look. \"What? It's flu season!\" We just roll are eyes. \"This is so exciting, people on the radio who are actually one of us!\" Larry states while crouching down. \"It could be them or them or them or them girls yes them girls\" Barry says pointing at girls as we walk out of the lift. \"No them girls are too tall. The Radio Rebels voices sound like... 5'6 to me, and their hair is red and a purple blue. Like Tara and Mara!\" Larry puts out there. \"Nooo! they are nothing like Tara and Mara\" Barry says pointing at us. \"Hey...\" Tara yell/whispers in annoyance and stops walking. \"Wh what's that supposed to mean!\" I say quite angry if I say so. \"Oh we love but your nothing like the Radio Rebels that are definitely are a blonde and a brunet\" Barry says while putting his arms on are shoulder but turned to Larry when he said the bit about the hair. I face plant. \"And you know this how?\" Larry asked his twin. \"Because the Radio Rebels are my soul mates, we are connected for example I also got a minus in participation\" Barry reply's to Larry. \"How can that be, you never shut up!\" Larry said. \"Exactly!\" Barry says excitedly. I sigh and notice Tara to see she was watching Stacy and her fellow pops kick a boys remote control car over and walk away. Poor kid. I shake my head in shame. \"How can they reject the status quo when status quo is... status quo?\" Tara says while looking at us. \"Like the Radio Rebels said be ourselves\" Audrey says while walking over to them me and Tara not far behind as we keep saying Audrey's name. \"Hi Stacy how's it going\" She says with me and Tara stood behind her as Barry and Larry come over. \"See? This is what I'm talking about. Everyone thinks they can talk to us because of those eternally lame Radio Babbles!\" Stacy says looking annoyed and pointing at us. \"We thinks she protest too much\" Barry said while popping his head over Kim's shoulder. \"Yea we thinks wait what do we thinks?\" Larry asks while looking at Barry. \"That maybe she is one of the Radio Rebels!\" Barry answered. \"Please! like I would ever encourage people like you to talk to us\" Stacy said while doing hand movements. \"Ah ha so you admit you listen to her!\" Larry says as he points a finger at her. Stacy scoffels and starts texting. Kim then slowly turns around and sees Barry staring at her intently. \"This one's staring at me make it stop!\" Kim says while looking back. \"Please don't stand so close to us!\" Stacy says coming back to the real word from texting. Kim just shooed him away. Tara watches while I just shake my head. \"You and I aren't any different! like the Radio Rebels said...\" Audrey was cut off by Stacy putting her finger in front of her mouth. \"No words, you don't think were different watch and learn Principal Marino...\" We all turn around to see Principal Marino walking past but as soon as she heard Stacy she came over to us. \"Stacy\" She says looking around. \"Is everything alright here?\" She asks. \"Actually no, Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some pod cast in class, but of course I said no\" Stacy lies looking all innocent. Bitch. Principal Marino looked at Audrey. \"What? No I mean I never...\" Audrey was cut off again but this time by Marino. \"You know that there's an anti-distraction policy, let me see your bag\" Marino says while getting it out. Audrey huffed. \"But I wasn't even listening to it\" she said \"Well now you can't can you\" the principal said in a mocking voice. \"You too young lady's\" The principal said holding out her hand to me and Tara. I sighed as I give my MP3 and earphones to her. \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention Stacy\" She says before walking away. \"Get it now? Your little DJ hero's don't know what their talking about\" Stacy says with attitude. I notice Tara trying to say something. \"Oh I'm sorry does her royal shyness want to say something?\" Stacy asked with sarcasm dripping from each word. Tara try's to say something but couldn't. \"Hum I guess not\" She says walking away with her posse. I look over at Tara \"You ok?\" I ask. She nods her head. \"Don't worry you will do it next time!\" I say. Just before we were about to go I felt a pair of eyes on me. I turn around to see Gabe looking at me. He smirks and winks at me before chatting with his friends again. Hope you like it! I will put the outfits Mara wears on my profile.[Chapter 2] Right now I was in music, Tara was in English and Audrey was in drama. I do like them classes but music is more my thing. I love music. I would love it more if Gabe was not in it. Right now I was sat next to my friend Violet went my teacher Miss Beach stars to talk. \"Alright everybody. Today we will be doing a project with Mr Soles drama class and Mrs Coles English class and it looks like there here now come on in everyone and take a seat\" Miss Beach says. I see Tara and Audrey come in so I wave at them to seat next and in front of me. \"This is going to be so exciting\" Audrey says taking the seat in front of me. Tara suddenly sees Gavin and speed walks out of the class room with me and Audrey hot on her tale. \"What is Gavin doing here\" She says once we get out of the class. \"Er he's in drama. You know you could talk to him you have had a crush on him since the first Harry Potter movie\" Audrey replies as I nod in agreement. \"Oh no no no, he is a new born pop okay totally wrong social racket, the best thing for me is to just avoid him all together\" Tara says with hand movements \"Gavin's not a leadist like that, ask yourself, what would the Radio Rebels do\" Audrey says with a sigh befor going back into class. \"It's ok sissy. You will be okay\" I say to her before we both went back into class. \"Okay I need a volunteer who would like to write a scene suggestion on the...\" Poor teacher didn't get to finish her sentence because Audrey was already writing something on the board. I smiled at Audrey. \"Oh did you want to pick a volunteer, I got excited. Drama is my life\" The class was laughing and so was I. \"Okay who wants to write a suggestion. Come on lets see hands people\" Audrey says while clapping her hands. \"Okay hands... Tara how about you come on up\" The teacher says. I think Tara has gone whiter then snow. Tara got up and walked to the front. I saw Audrey give Tara a little pep talk to help her. She then went up to the board and tried to write something but it came out in a wavy line. Tara turn around and looked at the class. Poor Tara looked like she was going to be sick. She turn back around, put the pen away and started to walking backwards but not before knocking Stacy's books off her desk. \"Hello, walk much\" Stacy says to Tara. She picks up the books but then whacked her head off the desk and her beanie falls off. The class starts laughing at Tara as she picks up her beanie and run to her seat. \"Are you ok?\" I ask her but all I got was a mumble. At home after school Me and Tara were at home doing the show. I was dancing about to the music and Tara sat down bopping her head to it. \"And that was the latest You First but who are you exactly. I think everyone is always juggling a bunch of different yous. Like when you are with your friends\" I say when the song ends. \"Sometimes your the funny one or the loud one or the thoughtful one. How about with someone you like? Which one of you shows up then? I don't even know who to be when I see the guy I'm crushing on\" Tara says. \"That's probably why she never talks to him. Is it just us, or do you feel like you are seventeen different people too? This song goes out to all are Linkcoln Bayers\" I say again as Tara puts the song on. Suddenly there is a knock at the door. Tara gets up to see who it is as I turn off the vocal masking button before going to the door. \"Hey\" It was Rob. \"Rob what are you doing here?\" Tara asks Rob. \"I live here\" He says. \"Okay well it was nice of you to stop by but\" I didn't get to finish my sentence because of Rob. \"So what do you think about the Radio Rebels?\" He asks us. \"What?! Why?!\" We say at the same time. \"I just wanted to get your take on them that's all\" He reply's. \"There great bye now\" Tara says as she tried to close the door but Rob stopped her. \"You know what I knew you two would think so. I really did. We have so much in common you know\" He says coming into Tara's room and sitting on the bed. \"Yeah we are all super busy\" I say. Rob sighs. \"You know I know that this is a really big transition for you with your dad in Taiwan and your mum and I just want you to know you have a friend here\" He says. Wow he really does care for use. \"It's fine we're fine\" Tara says for both of us. There was suddenly and awkward silence. \"So this is good. Here we all are hanging out listing to the Radio Rebels together\" Rob says cutting the awkward silence. \"Together\" Me and Tara say at the same time. I am getting a little worried. The song is almost down and Rob is still here. Fuck. The song stopped. We are dead. \"That's weird\" Rob says. I look at Tara. It was ether he found out or we stop the rest of the show. Tara just jumped to the seat and gave me a set of headphones as I turn on the vocal masking button on. \"And that rounds of the final set from my favourite local band\" Tara says. \"Now here is an extra long track just for you guys I hope you dig it\" I say as Tara press the song. I turn around to find Rob just stearing right at use. We got up to try and explain but... \"Your the Radio Rebels?!\" He said sounding surprised. \"That depends...\" I said slowly \"are we in trouble?\" Rob shook his head from side to side \"No no of course not it it's just I don't know how you two can do that I mean your both so shy?\" He said still surprised. \"We are... but there not\" Tara said. \"We don't know it just works\" I say finishing of my twins sentence smiling like an idiot. \"I can't believe it I mean I love it I just can't believe it we're going to take Slam FM to the next level!\" He says like everything is all rainbows and bunny. But there's me looking like I could die right there right now. \"I i'm sorry did you just say we?\" Tara stutters out the words I was about to say. \"Yeah I your going to be Slam FM's next big thing your both hired that's for sure your hired\" He walks out of Tara's room. Use both having a mental brake down. When there was a knock on the door and mum came walking right in. \"Ahhhhh I just happened to be eavesdropping I hope you don't mind OMG my babies are going are going to take Slam to the next level\" She squeals and hugs us both tightly. I could hear me and Tara breathing deeply and I think mum did as well. \"What's the matter?\" She asked use both. \"What if we mess it up\" We breathed at the same time. \"Oh honey's you have to take risk's. Like I always thought chartreuse was a bad colour for me but then I tried it and now it's my triad mark. And you know if something isn't faboo if you never try it don't you?\" She started to laugh and hug us again while we looked utterly confused.

This is another Radio Rebel FanFic with a girl OC. I hope you don't think I'm ripping off what other people have written like this one, I'm trying to be as original as possible. If you don't like it, or think I'm ripping other people off, then please just keep your bad comments to yourself. I hope you all like it! :) Melody's POV -IN TARA'S ROOM- \"These are the Radio Rebels, live from the underground.\" Tara said next to me. \"You don't know who we are, but we know who you are, because we're one of you.\" I said \"Report cards came out tonight. We both got a minus in participation, but you can't give use a minus for who we are.\" Said Tara Then I said \"Yeah, so, since grades are being handed out, I'll give all of us at Lincoln Bay High an F for labelling each other... Jocks, outcasts, dorks, queen bees and their fellow 'pops', and the new born 'pops'.\" \"Guys these are all labels not who we really are. Once upon a time being different was a good thing, now this differences just divide us.\" Tara said agreeing with me. \"You deserve to embrace your awesomeness, stand up for who you are, reject the status quo, we dare you.\" I said I should back the truck a bit. My name is Melody, Tara and I are cousins. I live with her because my parents died a few years ago. I have blondish brown half-curly hair between my shoulders and elbows. I'm a bit shorter than Tara but I convince myself it's because she's three months older than me. Tara and I started doing the show 'Radio Rebels' because we wanted to show everyone who we really are, but we're too shy to actually doing it (the result of us using voice modulators). -NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL WITH AUDREY- Tara closed her locker after getting out her books, and i was still getting mine. Then Audrey started talking. \"Ok last night the Radio Rebels...\" \"Were awesome?\" I asked knowing what she was going to say. \"As usual! ' Reject the status quo' is my new life motto.\" I closed my locker and we started walking with Audrey still talking about last night's show. \"They're so inspiring, so... themselves\" she said before sticking her red lollypop back in her mouth. \"I wish I could be more like them.\" Said Tara, and I 'hmm' ed in agreement. \"Hey! You should talk to your step-dad.\" Audrey said all of the sudden. \"What? Why?\" she asked starting to panic. \"Uhh... he runs the Slam FM, the biggest radio station in Seattle.\" Audrey said like it was obvious. \"Maybe he can give you girls an internship; that would be a big confidence booster, right?\" \"Are you kidding me? He's been married to my mom for what? Two months? He probably thinks I'm a total step-freak.\" Said Tara sadly, I tried cheering her up by saying \"Hey, I'm sure he thinks the same of me.\" She looked at me the said \"I don't think so you're totally fine talking with him, while I... well I freak out when he asks me what kind of cereal I want.\" We started walking in the next corridor when Tara said \"I just wish I could talk to everyone the way I talk to you, I guess that's why you're my BFFs... and cousin.\" I gave her a sympathetic smile. \"Uhh... BFFTLEWEs.\" Audrey said confusing us. We both gave her confused looks and she said \"Best friends for totally like ever without exception.\" \"Catchy.\" I said amazed by her . \"What you guys need is a relaxation technique. When I'm memorizing lines for drama I imagine I'm breathing in the words.\" Audrey said. \"Audrey, what does that even mean?\" Tara asked confused. She cleared her throat breathed in and then weirdly said breathing out \"You need to breath.. (breath in)..your words.\" \"How can you even breathe at a time like this?\" Barry said coming around the corner with Larry, and they pushed us to keep walking. \"Problem Barry?\" I asked annoyed. \"Last night the Radio Rebels gave the biggest clue yet about their identities. They go to our school.\" Barry said walking past us, then backwards, then forwards again. \"They mentioned it at 14:30 at Tuesday night's podcast.\" Larry said as we went into the elevator. \"Wow, obsessed much Larry?\" Audrey asked. \"Obsessed? Please! I- I would hardly describe myself as obsessive.\" Larry said, and pulled out a wipe out of his shirt, and wiped off the elevator button while muttering 'obsessive' to himself. We gave him of ' really?' . \"What? It's flu season!\" Larry said. I just nodded and decided not to take the conversation any further. We started to come out of the elevator and they were STILL talking about Radio Rebels. \"It's so exciting, people on the radio who're actually one of us!\" Larry said. \"It could be them… or them… or them… or them.. th-them.\" Barry said while pointing at a bunch of random girls. \"No those girls are too tall. The Radio Rebels' voices sound… 5'6 to me, and their hair are red and brown. Like Tara's and Melody's.\" Larry said. \"Noooo! They are nothing like them.\" Barry said. Wow, that hurt. Not really, but you know what I mean. \"Hey!\" I said in annoyance and stopping . \"Wha-what's that supposed to mean?\" Tara's asked obviously annoyed as well. \"Oh, we love you guys, but you two are nothing like Radio Rebels who are definitely blondes.\" Barry said putting a hand on Tara's shoulder then turning to Larry when he got to the hair colour part. \"And how do you know this how?\" Larry asked. \"One of the Radio Rebels is my soul mate. We're connected, for example, I also got a minus in participation.\" Barry said. Wow. He can be so stupid some times \"How can that be? You never shut up!\" Larry said. \"Exactly,\" Barry said, and we rolled our eyes. I saw Tara staring at something and looked in that direction. Stacy kicked a kid's toy car out of the way. She is so cruel and mean. \"Guys how do we reject the status quo, when the status quo is so… status quo?\" Tara asked, and I hmm'ed in agreement. \"Like the Radio Rebels say... be ourselves,\" Audrey said, and then she turned around and started walking towards Stacey. I quickly followed her to make sure she didn't get embarrassed by Stacey. The rest followed me after sharing a glance with each other. \"Hi, Stacy. How's it going?\" Audrey said to Stacy. Stacey looked at her funny and then she chuckled and said \"This is what I was talking about, everyone thinks they can talk to us because of those eternally lame, Radio babbles.\" \"We think she protests too much,\" Barry said to Kim \"Yeah, we thinks… wait, what do we thinks?\" Larry asked Barry. \"That maybe she's one of the Radio Rebels,\" Barry said motioning to Stacy. \"Please, like I would ever encourage people like you, to talk to us,\" Stacy said. \"Ah ha! So admit you listen to them!\" Larry said making a fool of himself. I just face palmed because of his stupidity. \"This one's staring at me. Make it stop.\" Kim said to Stacy. Barry was still next to her but he was now staring at her carefully. \"Please, don't stand so close to us,\" Stacy said annoyed. \"You and I aren't any different, like the Radio Rebels sai-\" Audrey started to say before she got interrupted by Stacey \"No words. You don't think we're different? Watch and learn. Principal Moreno!\" Stacy said, and Principal Moreno started walking towards us and said, \"Stacy! Is everything alright over here?\" \"Actually, no. Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some podcast in class. Of course I said no\" Stacy said. Ugh! What a liar! \"What? No! I never-\" Audrey got interrupted once again but this time by Principal Moreno \"You know there is an anti-distraction policy, let me see your bag.\" Moreno said. \"But I wasn't even listening to it,\" Audrey said while letting her take her MP3 player. \"Well now you can't. Can you?\" Moreno said in a mocking voice. \"You two as well, hand them over.\" She said Tara and I without even looking at us. I groaned in annoyance but handed my headphones to her anyways. and \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Stacy\" Moreno smiled to her and walked away. \"Get it now? Your little DJ heroes don't know what they're talking about,\" Stacy said. I looked at Tara and she looked like she wanted to say something back at her. \"Oh, does her royal shyness want to say something?\" Stacy said looking at Tara. Poor her, if it wasn't for her shyness... She tried to say something but everything just came out as a stutter. \"I thought not.\" Stacy said. She clicked her fingers and left with her 'pops'. I looked at Tara with a sympathetic smile and said \"Don't worry Tara; you'll do it next time.\" I felt like someone was watching me but I shrugged it off thinking it was nothing. I said by to the girls and headed for my class. Next chapter will be like Chapter 1, but in Gabe's POV. And then after his POV (which I think will be short), I will probably add more of Melody's POV. Plz review and tell me what you think! :) Ale, out.[Chapter 2] Ok first of all, I'm so so so so terribly sorry for not updating in like for ever! But I was kind of busy and then I didn't know what to write, but a few days ago I got an idea so I'm FINALLY updating. Secondly, I decided to make the whole thing on Melody's POV because it's just a hell lot easier. Thirdly, thank you so much for being very supportive and I'm still not completely sure where I'm going with this story so if you have any suggestions, any AT ALL, please please please PLEASE PM me or review. Fourthly, I would like to thank everyone who has reviewed, followed and favourited this story (and me). You all made me want to continue on with this story, and again I'm SO VERY sorry for the HUGE wait and I hope you can forgive me. I will be forever grateful for the HUGE amount of reviews, favourites and SPECIALLY follows. Love you all! Lastly, so sorry again, and I hope you guys like this chapter. I made my way to my Music class while humming the tune of a new song I was working on. I went inside the class and made my way to the seat next to my best friend, Rosie. Rosie has straight, long black hair, pale skin, bright blue eyes, and she's quite tall. In other words, she's insanely pretty. \"Hey!\" She said once I plopped down on the seat next to her. \"Hey.\" I replied, not as enthusiastically. The music room is basically a big space with a few chairs, and heaps of instruments everywhere; including a grand piano, a few keyboards, a few guitars, drums, some brass and string instruments, some percussion instruments, microphones and a few recording machines. \"So did you listen to the Radio Rebels last night?\" she asked. Before I could answer, she went on. \"Of course you did! What kind of loser doesn't? I mean, probably even Stacey and the GGGG's listen to them!\" Just then Gabe and 2 of the other GGGG's walk in; Gavin takes Drama with Audrey. \"And speaking of the devil.\" I mutter under my breath. Gabe and his 2 friends sit on the opposite side of the room... thankfully. I continue to talk with Rosie about the Radio Rebels show and what we think the new Music project is going to be, until Ms White comes in and tells everyone to be quiet. \"Ok, attention class! Today we are going to start on the new project. We are going to join Mrs Hunter's English class (A/N: I don't know what her name is so I just made it up ;D) and Mr Sole's Drama class. We are going to make a musical. Mrs Hunter's English class are going to be writing the scripts, Mr Sole's Drama class are going to help make all the props and decide who is going to portray who, and we are going to write the songs and play the soundtrack during the musical. So everybody... Lets go to the English classroom. Come on, lets go, go, go!\" We stood up and walked to the English classroom. I was really excited, because we were working with both Tara's and Audrey's class. Also, this musical thing, sounds quite fun. On the way there, Rosie and I were discussing what we thought the musical would be about and we thought could portray what. Once we got there, I spotted Tara and Audrey (who was waving at Rosie and I) at the back of the classroom. We sat down in 2 free seats next to Audrey and Tara. Then Mrs Hunter started to talk. \"I need a volunteer. Who would like to write a suggestion on the boar...\" she never got to finish because Audrey had already ran up to the whiteboard and was writing an idea for the musical. Everyone was chuckling at Audrey's enthusiasm. Mrs Hunter cleared her throat and Audrey turned to see her glaring at her. She smiled sheepishly and said. \"Oh... did you want to pick a volunteer? I got excited, drama is my life.\" people were still chuckling, including Tara, Rosie and myself. Audrey then turned to the class. \"Ok. who wants to write a suggestion?\" When no one raised their hand, she sighed and exclaimed. \"Lets see hands people!\" and she clapped trying to encourage other people to make suggestions. A few people raised their hands and the teacher looked around. \"Hands, hands, hands... Tara. How about you? Come on up.\" Tara looked at me terrified, so I whispered to her: \"Come on Tara, just breath deeply and don't look at anyone. You can do it.\" She nodded and stood up and made her way to the front of the class. I was Audrey whisper something to her while she was coming back, and Tara nod before she continued walking to the front. Tara grabbed the marker and raised it to the board. She tried to write something but all that she could draw was a squiggly line. She turned around to face the class. Oh no. She won't be able to do it now that she saw everyone looking at her. She quickly turned back around and she started to walk backwards away from the board. She then bumped into Stacey's desk, dropping something on the way. \"Hello! Walk much?!\" asked Stacey, obviously annoyed. Tara quickly ducked to pick up whatever she dropped and when she was standing up again, she bumped her head on the desk, causing her beanie to fall off. She quickly grabbed her beanie, put Stacey's thing back on her desk, and just as quickly run back to her desk. She buried her head in her arms and Audrey, Rosie and I started whispering reassuring words to her. \"What's wrong with your friend?\" I turned to my left and I was surprised to see Gabe talking to me. I didn't even notice he was sitting next to me. I frowned and snapped back, \"Nothing's wrong, she just isn't comfortable in front of a big group.\" He chuckled and said, \"No kidding.\" I scoffed and turned away from him. Seriously, if he hasn't got anything nice to say, he shouldn't say anything at all. I tunned out the teacher a bit until we finally decided that the musical was going to be like a modern Romeo and Juliet, but with some twists. Like... the ending wasn't going to be sad, it was going to take place in a school, during this time, and some other smaller details. We were going to start to write the scripts, music and songs tomorrow. After that class was dismissed. Ok... so this chapter... not so great... and quite short. But I promise to write more often now, and this WILL get better, I swear. Also, as you can see, I've changed the small scenes to a musical... tell me what you think might happen. I'm still not fully sure what could happen between Gabe and Melody (there hasn't been much Gabe/Melody yet, but I promise there WILL be some soon) so if you could PLEASE help me out, I would be VERY grateful and I would update a lot sooner; so PLEASE review or PM me ideas! xoxo~ PopiAle :)[Chapter 3] Hey guys! So I was wondering if anyone would like to help me write this story? I have a lot of ideas but I've never been good at writing stuff. I'll give you guys another chapter, but if you are interested in helping me please PM asap! *•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•* Rosie and I were in Gym and our class was playing basketball. At the moment the guys were the ones playing. It was the 'cool' guys versus the 'nerds'. I saw Gabe showing off like always and I rolled my eyes. Rosie saw this... unfortunately. \"Why did you just roll your eyes at Gabe?\" She asked me with one eyebrow up. \"No reason.\" I said shrugging and not taking my eyes off of the game. I hoped she would drop the matter, but with the luck I have, of course she didn't. \"You know, if I didn't know any better, I would say you have a crush on him.\" She was grinning and she ha turned back to the game knowing that that would get my attention. My head snapped to her direction and for a second I didn't even know how to respond to that. Finally I regained my senses and almost screamed. \"What?! Are you crazy?! Why would you think that? I could never like him!\" \"Really? Cause it looks the totally cliche \"I hate you, but I actually love you\" kind of romance.\" \"Oh please. There's only hate here, no love whatsoever. He is an arrogant jerk. He doesn't care about anything or anyone. How could I possibly like a guy like that?\" \"You never know.\" was Rosie's simple answer. She didn't even turn away from the game. I just shook my head and scoffed in bewilderment. A few minutes later the teacher blew his whistle indicating the end of the boys' game and the start of the girls' game. The teams had already been chosen during the boys' game so we just got ready to play. Rosie and I stood ready to receive the ball to then try to run down the court and get a basket. The whistle blew again and the game started. Rosie caught the ball and she started dribbling to the ring. I ran close to her and she passed me the ball. I then passed it to a teammate who passed it to someone else and then the ball was back to me when I was close enough to hoop. I shot and the ball went in. My teammates cheered for me and Rosie gave me a double high-five and then just when she was gonna walk past me she whispered something in my ear. \"Looks like Gabe can't stop looking at you.\" I turned to her but all she did was smirk. I then turned behind and true to Rosie's words, Gave was seating with his friends on bleachers staring right at me. I raised my eyebrows as if asking him 'What?'. That made him snap out of some sort of trance he was in and he quickly turned always from me and started talking with his friends. I turned back to the game and scored a few more goals, but every so often I would feel Gabe's eyes on me again. But every time I made eye contact with him h would quickly look away and act like he hadn't even noticed I was there. When the game finished I looked at Gabe's direction once more but this time he stood up and seemed to be walking towards me. I turned to Rosie who had made her way next to me. \"It looks like you aren't the only one that is having some mixed feelings.\" I was about to ask her what she meant by that but before I could someone spoke behind me. \"Not bad, Adams. I never would've imagined you were good at something.\" I turned to see Gabe standing in front of me. \"Wow. For a second there I thought you were actually gonna say something nice, but you ruined it with the last part. Thanks anyways.\" I shot him a sarcastic smile and turned towards the changing rooms with Rosie right behind me. \"Oohhh! Someone's got a crush on Melody!\" She wiggled her eyebrows at me but I just rolled my eyes at her. \"Oh shut up. We both know that's not true. As if Gabe could actually like someone. He doesn't like girls, he just kisses them and never talks to them again. Like I've said a million times... He's a jerk!\" Sometimes I think Rosie just has nothing better to do than gossip. \"Oh come on Melody! He was totally checking you out during the game, and then after he even complimented you!\" She stood there ready, waiting for me to finish getting ready. \"Oh please you could hardly call that a compliment.\" I zipped up my bag ready to leave the changing room. \"But-\" I cut her off before she could complain. \"Look, just drop it. Okay?\" I walked off out of the changing room. I ignored Rosie's calling of my name and something about there being a thin line between hate and love or something like that. I was so not looking forward to lunch, knowing Rosie would tell Aubrey about her \"suspicions\" and knowing them both they won't stop bothering me about it. God help me! *•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•*•* I hoped you guys liked this. I'm sorry of never updating but like I said before, I'm not good at putting ideas into words. Please review and PM me! I'll try to update soon! Thanks for all the support! ~PopiAle XoXo ","Summary":" HI! This is another Radio Rebel FanFic with a girl OC. I hope you don't think I'm ripping off what "},{"Movie":"Phone Booth","Title":"Take away my anxieties","Author":"dog-tooth","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6237961","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 Emily Emily walked down the street, her brown hair blowing wildly around her because of the strong wind. She was meant to be at school but her brother had asked to see her and she couldn't say no. Especially not after how bad he'd been lately. She was wearing a pair of dark blue skinny jeans and a black band shirt which she was feeling slightly uncertain about. For some reason she felt as if she should have dressed up a bit more. As she reached the end of the street she realised that through the noise of the wind screaming through the air she could hear the sound of a phone ringing. The street was empty so she knew that it wasn't anybody's mobile. She looked around, trying to find the source of the noise, until her eyes eventually rested on a phone booth, a few metres away from her. Something flashed in her memory of a day two years ago but she ignored it. She couldn't let herself be drawn in by irrational fears. She walked over to the phone booth, the door closing behind her, and picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" she asked. \"Hello,\" the voice replied, a hint of amusement in the man's voice. \"Erm...Are you calling for someone in particular?\" Emily asked, fiddling with the phone cord. \"Why do you say that?\" \"Well, this is a phone booth.\" \"I am calling for someone in particular, yes.\" \"And who would that be?\" \"You.\" Emily laughed. \"Who are you exactly? I wasn't expecting a call.\" \"It doesn't matter who I am. It only matters who you are Emily.\" She paused, not knowing what to say. \"How do you know my name?\" \"Oh I know lots of things about you. I know that you're seventeen years old. I know that you and your parents don't get on. I know that you ride your bike to school everyday. I also know that you're bunking off school today so that you can meet up with your brother.\" \"How the hell do you know that?\" Emily was scared now. How did this man know this about her? Something about this seemed familiar. \"I told you Emily. I know a lot about you. I know a lot about your brother as well.\" \"Okay then. What's his name?\" \"That's easy. His name is Stu.\" He knew too much. How did he know so much? \"Okay, I'm hanging up now.\" \"It wouldn't be in your best interest to disconnect me Emily. Oh wait, would you prefer Ems?\" \"Oh god. What do you want?\" \"I just want a conversation with someone. Is that so wrong?\" \"Why do you want a conversation with me? You could talk to anyone else.\" \"You don't recognise my voice do you? Wait, but then again why would you? I only talked to your brother.\" \"M-my brother? What do you mean you've only talked to my brother?\" \"Stu and I had a great conversation a few years ago. I'm sure he told you about it. It didn't end well. I'm hoping this conversation will be different.\" \"No,\" Emily muttered, shaking her head back and forth. \"You're meant to be dead.\" He laughed down the phone. \"Don't act so surprised Emily. I know that Stu told you that I wasn't dead. You are his sister after all.\" \"What do you really want? It's obviously not just a conversation that you're after.\" \"I'll be honest with you Emily. There is something that I want. However I don't want to spoil the surprise for you. I want you to work it out yourself.\" \"How am I meant to work it out? You're a fucking psycho. Do you know how fucked up my brother became after he spoke to you.\" \"Oh but we your brother and I weren't just speaking were we?\" Through the phone Emily heard the distinct sound of a gun being cocked. Emily covered her mouth to try and cover up the sob that escaped from her. \"Now doesn't that just torque your jaw? I love that. You know, just like in the movies, when the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun. Now, why didn't he have it cocked? Because, that sound is scary. It's cool, isn't it?\" \"Not really,\" Emily replied shakily. He laughed. \"You're boring Emily. Are you scared?\" \"Of course I'm scared.\" \"I don't think you're scared enough. I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you. Now, what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it? A 30 calibre bolt-action 700, with a carbon one modification and a state-of-the-art hands-hold tactical scope. And it's staring straight at you.\" She looked around wildly, her eyes looking up at all the windows surrounding her. \"You won't be able to find me Emily, too many windows.\" He paused but continued when she didn't say anything. \"Stu was more scared then you are. He was practically begging for his life after I told him that I had a gun.\" \"That doesn't sound like Stu.\" \"Doesn't it? Well, it seems like you don't know your brother as well as I do.\" Emily ignored this. \"Is this why you want to talk to me? Because of my brother, Stu?\" \"That's part of the reason. You see I was intrigued. I got to know everything about Stu's life. His life, his girlfriend, his wife. But the one thing I never really knew about Stu was what his family was like. So that's what I've done for the past two years. I've found out as much as I can about you, your mother and your father.\" \"But why are you still so interested in Stu? He's changed now.\" \"Oh I've seen the way he's changed and I'm not sure I like it.\" \"What do you mean? You said that the whole reason you did it was to make him more honest and he is. He's so different now.\" \"I wanted him to be honest, sure, but I didn't want him to throw his life away. I gave him the opportunity to change his life, to better himself, and what does he do instead? Fucks everything up.\" \"Kelly left him though. It wasn't his fault. \"Oh Emily. You're so naive. Of course it's his fault. We all have a choice about what we do and it just so happens that Stu made the wrong choice.\" \"What're you going to do then?\" Emily asked in a still shaking voice. \"I'm going to have a word with Stu. You have his number right?\" \"Of course.\" \"Okay. Get out his number and call him.\" \"Wait, don't do this. Stu's messed up enough as it is. If you talk to him then it's just gonna make him worse.\" The caller laughed. \"I really don't think you should be telling me what to do. Now, get your mobile phone out and dial Stu's number. Make sure that it's on loudspeaker.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Stu Isn't it funny? You hear a phone ring and it could be anybody. But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it? Stu woke up with a gasp, sweat dripping down his face. \"Fuck,\" he muttered into his hands. He'd had that nightmare again. The one that he'd had every night for the past few months, ever since that damn phone call. It always started the same. He'd be in the centre of a room, with Pam and Kelly on either side. In his hand he'd be holding a telephone. The telephone would ring, over and over. He'd ignore it at first but it would get louder and louder, until eventually he'd have no choice but to answer it. Then he'd wish he'd never answered the phone. \"Hello Stu,\" that oh so familiar voice would say, a hint of amusement in his voice. Stu had never been given the opportunity to say anything back to the man in his dream, but he knew what he would say. \"Fuck off you bastard.\" He could even imagine the reply that he would get. \"Stu, that kind of language is uncalled for.\" However the dream never went like that. Instead the caller would start laughing into the phone, making Stu's anger flare up. Then he'd say the words that had always haunted Stu, not just in his dreams but throughout his life since as well. \"Kelly or Pam. You choose.\" Stu would look from left to right, almost as if debating but it was always useless. Two shots would echo through the room, and Pam and Kelly would drop to the floor, dead. Then he'd wake up, usually shivering and drenched in sweat. You'd think that it would be the image of Kelly's and Pam's dead bodies that would scare him the most but it wasn't. It was the words that the caller would say. \"Kelly or Pam. You choose.\" Simple words really. Simple words that would never haunt anyone else throughout their lifetime, only Stu, but just hearing the names of the two girls whom he'd loved made him want to punch something in anger. The words \"you choose\" scared him as well. What kind of idiot would give him, of all people, a choice? He'd realised, whilst in that phone booth, that he didn't love Pam. If it had been love that he'd felt towards her, then it was minor, significant even, compared to the love that he felt for Kelly. He loved her more then life itself, and it took this man to show him that. However it also took this man to reveal to Kelly that Stu was a bad man that she could do without. Just because he'd made a public apology for everything, didn't make what he'd done any easier for her to understand. He'd been a bad man and Kelly couldn't cope with that. Sure, she tried her hardest to make it work. At first she loved him more then she ever had before, but after a while Kelly couldn't cope anymore. It wasn't just the bad things that he'd done previously that scared her shitless (which were the words of Kelly herself) but the new man that he'd become. Sometimes Stu struggled to understand this. Sure, the man he was now was incredibly different from the man he'd been before, but he didn't think that it was an altogether bad change. Before he'd been greedy and selfish, now he was more reasonable and altruistic. Well, maybe not as reasonable as most people always were, but enough for it to have made an incredible difference on the way he lived his life. She'd told him that it wasn't this that made her not love him anymore. She said that it was the nightmares that he had and the nights when he'd wake up screaming and crying. She said it was the fact that he now took medication for the constant anxiety attacks that had become an unwilling part of his life. She said that what had happened on that day had mentally scarred her and she couldn't look at him the same anymore. She said that she didn't feel the same about him. She said that she couldn't take it anymore! What about him? What about the fact that everyday he had to look at the man in the mirror and realise what a failure he'd become. Sometimes he'd blame himself for what happened and sometimes he'd blame the man who'd called him and changed his world. Either way, he knew that he'd never be the same again. For better or worse, he didn't know. Stu sighed as he reached over to the table next to his bed and picked up a small bottle of tablets. Pouring two of them from the bottle, he walked over to the bathroom and swallowed the small pills down with a glass of water. Now that he was standing in front of the sink, he had no choice but to stare at his reflection in the mirror. His brown hair was now shrivelled and long, compared to how neat it had been before. He hadn't shaved for over a month now, meaning his lips were barely visible against the darkness and heaviness of his beard. The eyes were what scared him most. His brown eyes never looked as warm as they once had. When he looked at them, he could see something that scared him senseless. What it was he didn't know. You wouldn't have expected a man like Stu to have been changed so much by the experience. He'd been the kind of man who thought he had it all. Money, a wife, a mistress, power. What more could a man have asked for? A lot, that's what. His life hadn't been perfect, not at all, and the caller had pointed out these flaws. Then again, it was partially his fault. Of course he wasn't willing to take all the blame but he knew now that he shouldn't have done what he did. It was wrong. It was even more wrong because Kelly had left him because of it. 'Fuck my life' he thought as he slowly started to walk around and get dressed. Usually he'd stay at home in a t-shirt and pair of tracksuit bottoms but today he was meeting with his sister. He'd phoned her earlier to ask whether she wanted to meet him. It'd been over a month since he'd last seen her and he knew that they needed to talk. She'd be worried about him but she wouldn't want to call in case he didn't want to talk. That was just the way Emily was. So, to try and stop Emily from worrying so much he grabbed a pair of jeans and a jumper and put them on. He even brushed his hair and sprayed some aftershave on himself. However, just as he was about to walk out of the door to meet Emily the phone rang. He paused, already halfway out of the doorway, with half a mind to ignore it. Then he realised that it might be Emily so he closed his front door behind him and grabbed the phone off of its handset. \"Hello?\" he asked. Emily's voice came through the speaker in the phone. \"Hey Stu.\" Her voice was shaky and she sounded scared so he asked her whether she was okay. \"Well, I guess so,\" came the reply, sounding even more scared then before. \"Emily, what's wrong?\" \"I can't really-\" She paused in reply and in the background he could hear another voice. \"I'm so sorry for this Stu, I really am,\" she continued after a while. \"Sorry for what? Emily, just tell me what's wrong!\" Another voice came through the speakers and Stu fell to the ground in shock. \"Hello Stu. Long time no speak.\" He knew that voice. He knew that fucking voice. \"No,\" he muttered, over and over, until eventually he was screaming it down the phone. The man on the phone started laughing. \"Calm down Stu. No need to get hysterical.\" \"Emily, are you still there?\" Stu asked once he could speak again. \"I'm still here Stu,\" she replied and from her voice he knew that she was crying. \"Is he with you? Where are you?\" \"He's not with me. He just called a phone booth and I picked up the phone.\" \"Oh but I can see her Stu,\" the man on the phone said, laughing slightly. \"It's hard to imagine she's related to you. I mean she's beautiful, honest, smart, the complete opposite of you.\" \"Fuck off!\" Stu shouted down the phone. \"Now, now Stu. That language is uncalled for. Especially when in the presence of a young lady.\" Stu sighed. \"What do you want?\" \"You know that's the same question Emily asked me when I first spoke to her. What is it with you two?\" \"Maybe it's just that we want to know what the hell you want,\" Emily interrupted. \"You know, the clue's in the question.\" The man laughed. \"Okay then. Do you really want to know what I want?\" \"Yes,\" Stu and Emily said together. \"I want to meet up with you, both of you, but especially you Stu.\" Stu sucked in a breath. \"Why do you want to meet me? I've changed. You must know that.\" \"Oh, I know you've changed Stu, but as I've said earlier to your sister I don't like it. You're wasting your life away. I gave you the opportunity to make it up with Kelly and you ruined it. After everything that I did for you.\" \"It wasn't my fault,\" Stu insisted. \"You see this is why I want to meet with you Stu. I think you need to learn that it was your fault. All of this is your fault, such as the situation with your sister, the fact that your life is in such a state, everything Stu.\" Stu clutched his head in his hands. \"Okay,\" he murmured. \"It's all my fault. I can see it now. Just leave Emily out of this.\" \"Do you really expect me to believe that?\" the man sighed. \"We still need to meet Stu but I'm not sure whether you will agree to meet with me. Therefore it's your fault that I have to do this.\" \"Do what?\" Stu asked, worry tinting his voice. \"I'll call you back in a few minutes Stu, seeing as I'm not sure whether Emily will be able to hold her mobile up against the phone for much longer.\" \"What do you-?\" Emily started only for her voice to be drowned out by a loud bang, a shattering of glass and a scream. The scream came from Emily herself. \"What the fuck have you done?\" Stu shouted down the phone. There was no answer and Stu's chest started to become tight with panic. \"Emily? Are you there?\" After a few minutes of no reply Stu was really starting to panic. Desperately he reached over and grabbed the small bottle of pills that he always kept handy. Not bothering to get up and get water, he poured out a handful of pills and swallowed them whole. A beep from the phone, still pressed up against his ear, indicated that he had another call coming through. As quickly as he could he pressed the call button, allowing the call to come through. \"Hello?\" he asked. \"Hello Stu,\" came the reply from the man whom he'd been on the phone to earlier. \"What have you don't to Emily?\" he asked angrily. \"Don't worry Stu. She's not hurt. Merely unconscious.\" \"What was that bang then?\" \"I shot her,\" the man said, amusement strong in his voice. Stu expected him to start laughing at any moment. Stu's breath hitched up a notch. \"You shot her? Is she hurt?\" The man burst into laughter at this. \"I shot her sure, but I didn't shoot her with a gun you imbecile. Do you think that if I shot her with a gun she'd be simply unconscious? I shot her with a small drug that should knock her out for a couple of hours. Long enough for you to come and find her.\" \"I fucking hate you,\" Stu whispered angrily into the phone. \"Come on Stu, don't be petty. Do you think I really care?\" \"Of course not. You're a cold hearted bastard.\" \"Ouch Stu. That hurt,\" he mocked. \"Where is she? What have you done with Emily?\" \"She's still in the phone booth. However I'll be moving her to my hotel room soon. But don't worry. I'll look after her until you get there.\" \"Well where is it?\" \"Stu, don't rush me. I'll call you later on with the address. After all, I don't want you to get there before me.\" Stu had reached his limit. He was scared and feared for his little sister. That's why he did something that he never thought he'd have to do again to this man. He begged. \"Look, don't hurt her please. I'll do anything you want.\" \"I'm not going to hurt her unless you do what I say. You just have to be patient. I'll call you in an hour or so to give you the address and then you can check that your darling sister is okay.\" Stu squeezed his eyes closed and sighed deeply. \"Okay,\" he said eventually. \"Good man. Oh and Stu, don't call anyone else because I will know about it. Just sit there and wait patiently. I'll call you later.\" A repetitive beeping noise sounded down the phone, telling Stu that the caller had disconnected. Stu threw the phone to the floor but it was attached to the wall by a metal cord so it only hung in the air. He was unbelievably angry as well as worried for his sister. That man had ruined his life two years ago and here he was, ruining his life once again. And there was nothing he could do. So he sat there on his dirty beige carpet and prayed for a miracle like the pathetic man he was.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Emily All Emily could feel was pain when she woke up. What the hell had happened to her? The last thing she remembered was the sound of glass smashing and then something small and painful hitting her in the back. Then she woke up in this dark room. The room that she was in was so dark that she couldn't even tell where she was. All she knew was that she was sitting on a chair and her hands were tied behind her back with something rough. She wasn't sure exactly how long she'd been unconscious for but judging by the darkened state of the room she'd say it at must have been at least two hours. \"Hello?\" she called out cautiously. Their came no reply but Emily knew that it didn't mean she was alone. Maybe they were just ignoring her. Emily had an instinctive feeling that the man on the phone was the one who'd tied her up in this room. This scared her, she wasn't afraid to admit it. This man had almost killed her brother and she knew that he'd admitted to killing several people before. However she was confused about his intentions. Before he'd killed the other men because they had done bad things. Emily hadn't done anything bad, so why had he tied her up. Now that Emily thought about it, Stu hadn't done anything bad either. He was a changed man but this man didn't seem to understand this. From somewhere outside of the room she heard a loud bang, indicating that someone else was nearby. \"Hello?\" she called out, wanting to have some confirmation on who had taken her and tied her up. The banging noise stopped and she heard footsteps coming towards the room. With a loud bang the door was thrown open, revealing a tall figure. Emily couldn't tell who it was because there was no light in the room or outside of the room However she could tell from the shadowy form that the person was a man. \"W-who are you?\" Emily stuttered at the man. He didn't reply, nor did he move, instead standing in the doorway. Emily couldn't tell if he was looking at her or not because she couldn't see his eyes, which freaked her out slightly. \"Please,\" she whispered. \"What do you want?\" When he finally answered her Emily wasn't as surprised as she thought she would be. It was the man who she had been talking on the phone to a few hours ago. \"It's always the same questions Emily.\" She sobbed, tears streaming down her face, as his voice sent shivers of fear down her spine. \"Oh god. Why can't you just leave me alone?\" \"What would be the fun in that?\" he replied, taking a step towards her. \"I don't understand any of this.\" \"Once again. If I told you what this was all about, then where would the fun be?\" While he had been talking he'd walked even closer, until he was standing directly in front of him. It was so dark that still couldn't see his face. The only thing that she could see was that he was wearing glasses. This was only because the little light that was in the room was reflecting off the lenses. His head was turned towards her so she assumed that he was looking at her. After a while he spoke again. \"I have to call someone. I'll be back soon.\" With that he walked back out of the room and left her alone in the dark. Because he had left the door open she could hear his footsteps as he walked away from the room that she was in. She sniffed slightly and blinked a few times to try and stop the tears that were streaming down her face. After a while she became uncomfortable sitting there with her hands tied behind her back. Her arms were starting to ache and the wooden chair wasn't particularly comfortable to sit on for a long period of time. Irritated she started to try and move her arms but the rope dug into her wrists making her hiss in pain. \"Fuck,\" she hissed out loud. \"I hate it when people swear.\" Emily jumped slightly as she saw the man was back from wherever he had gone. How strange that she hadn't heard him. He walked towards her and she flinched backwards as he knelt down in front of her. \"Do you want me to tell you who I was on the phone too?\" he asked. She nodded. \"I was on the phone to Stu.\" \"Why?\" \"Well, seeing as Stu and I haven't seen each other for two years now, I thought it would be good if we met up again. You know, for old time's sake. So, I called him up and asked him to come over.\" Emily didn't know how to reply. In a way she was glad that Stu was coming over. She was scared of this man. However she didn't want him to get hurt. For the past two years he'd struggled to get over what had happened on that day. After Kelly had left him he became even worse. She loved her brother and couldn't stand to see him go back to how he was before. Before she had a chance to talk again a loud banging echoed throughout the room. The man smirked. \"Aha. Looks like your brother's here.\" Emily watched, confused, as the man walked back out of the room. How had Stu managed to get here so quickly? From down the corridor she could faintly hear Stu's angry voice, followed by the calmer voice of the man. \"Where is she?\" Stu was shouting. \"She's in that room on the left,\" the man replied. Within a minute or so Stu came into the room and ran over to her. \"Emily is that you? Are you okay? Has he hurt you?\" he asked quickly, kneeling down in front of her. \"No,\" Emily said softly, tears streaming down her face once again. \"I'm fine Stu, really.\" \"No,\" he hissed angrily. \"You're not fine. He fucking tied you up.\" The man's voice came from the doorway. \"Stop being so melodramatic Stu.\" Stu turned angrily. \"Untie her,\" he demanded. \"And turn on some lights. Why the hell is it so dark in here?\" \"I thought it made it more dramatic,\" he replied, laughing. \"Like in the movies when the killer kidnaps someone. He wouldn't turn on the light because his victim becomes more scared not knowing what the person looks like. But then again I'm not going to kill you. Well, not if I don't have to. So-\" he stopped talking and Emily heard a click. She had to close her eyes as suddenly the lights were turned on and bright, yellow light filled the room. When she opened them again she got her first look at the man who had tied her up and talked to her on the phone. He had brown hair which was slicked back with some kind of gel and it looked like he hadn't shaved in a while due to the stubble that covered his chin. Underneath his thick black glasses she could see that he had brown eyes. He was wearing a pair of black trousers, a light blue shirt and a long beige coat. His appearance shocked Emily slightly. She'd expected him to be wearing a suit or something to make him look smart. He looked over at her and saw the way in which she was staring at him. She blushed as he smirked at her and she looked around the room instead. It looked like she was in a house of some sort, inside a room. However it was empty apart from several objects. In the corner of the room, in front of the window, there was a sniper rifle on a stand. She assumed that this is what the man had been looking at her from. Emily suddenly remembered that Stu was in the room with her. Stu was staring up at the man with a strange expression on his face. She couldn't tell whether it was anger or pure shock. To her it looked like a mix between the two. \"Well, you two seem...shocked to see me,\" the man said, a smirk still on his face. \"Now, how about I tell you what's going to happen. I think you're going to like it.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Stu Stu stared in shock at the man before him. He'd only seen this man once and that had been when he was drugged up, meaning that he'd never properly seen his face. He took in the man, noting his thick glasses and the long, tan coat that he wore. It was strange how he was wearing the same outfit that he'd been wearing when Stu had first met him. The smirk that the man wore on his face was extremely irritating but Stu didn't voice his opinion out loud. He didn't want to provoke him. \"Well, you two seem...shocked to see me,\" the man said, still smirking. \"Now, how about I tell you what's going to happen.\" \"Yes,\" Stu said, standing up. \"That would be good.\" \"Well, seems like you've got some of your confidence back Stu.\" From the corner of his eye Stu could see Emily looking worriedly up at him. He ignored her and concentrated on the man in front of him. \"Have you missed me?\" the man asked before Stu had a chance to say anything. \"Of course not,\" he hissed angrily. It was obvious by the man's expression that he did not believe him. \"Right,\" he said, giving one last look to Stu, before turning his attention to Emily. \"Do you want to know who I am?\" he asked her. She nodded and the man smiled. Stu wanted to punch him right then. \"My name's Keifer.\" \"Is that really your name?\" Stu interrupted. Keifer's eyes went to Stu. \"Stu isn't really your name. It's Stuart right?\" Stu scoffed. \"Whatever.\" Keifer smirked. \"Now,\" he continued. \"As I was saying before, you want to know what's going on here don't you.\" He didn't wait for them to say anything before carrying on. He was looking and directing his words at Stu as he spoke. \"So, I'll explain. I want to know if you've really changed Stu. After all, it's been two years. You could have gone back to your old ways.\" Stu shook his head. \"No. I haven't.\" \"Oh, but you could just be lying, couldn't you? You're a good liar aren't you Stu. I just find it so hard to believe you.\" Stu knew that he was being mocked but he ignored it. \"Okay, how can I prove it?\" The smile that Stu was given by Keifer sent chills down his spine. \"I was hoping that you'd ask that.\" Both him and Emily watched as Keifer walked over to a small cupboard in the corner of the room and opened it. He heard Emily gasp from beside him as a man was dragged out of the cupboard and thrown to the floor. The man was wearing a suit that had obviously once been in pristine condition. It looked very expensive. However, now it was ripped and dirty. The man's hands were tied behind his back, just like Emilys. \"Please,\" the man begged, grabbing onto Keifer's trouser leg. \"I'll change I swear.\" Keifer just laughed before kicking the man in the face, causing him to topple backwards. \"You see, I don't think you will.\" His attention shifted back to Emily and Stu. \"This man here's called Derek. He's my new friend. The best thing is that he's just like you used to be Stu. He's selfish, a liar and he uses people.\" Stu really didn't want to know but he had to ask. \"Why do you have him here?\" \"You're asking all of the right questions today Stu. Well done.\" Keifer grabbed the man by his hair and dragged him over so that he was on the floor next to Emily. He then reached into his pocket and took out a pistol. Stu flinched as Keifer walked towards him with the gun in his hands. However instead of shooting at him he threw the gun at Stu's feet. \"What do you want me to do with this?\" Stu asked. A strange feeling was spreading through him as he looked down at the gun. However he couldn't quite place what the emotion was. \"I want you to shoot someone,\" Keifer replied simply. \"What the-? Who do you want me to shoot exactly?\" Stu could see Emily looking up at him with tear filled eyes but he was scared to look at her in case she managed to place the feeling that he was experiencing. \"I'm a nice man Stu, so you know what? I'm going to give you a choice.\" He looked between Emily and Derek, a smile on his face. \"Emily or Derek. It's your choice. Kill one and the other lives.\" \"N-no,\" Stu muttered, shaking his head back and forth. \"I wouldn't. I-I couldn't.\" \"Stu, of course you could. I know what you're like. When we were on the phone together, two years ago, I remember you saying how you'd happily shoot me with a big smile on your face.\" \"That was two years ago. I've changed now. How many times do I have to tell you?\" \"Prove it then. Prove to me that you're a changed man. Pick up the gun from the floor, go on.\" Stu did what he said and leant down to pick up the gun. It felt surprisingly heavy in his hands. He'd expected it to be lighter. \"Now,\" Keifer said, taking a step away from Stu and closer to Emily and Derek. He was now standing to the left of Emily, whilst Derek was on the right of Emily. \"Who are you going to shoot?\" \"No one. I'm not going to shoot either of them. Why the hell would I?\" \"If you shoot one of them then I'll believe that you've changed and I'll let you, and whoever's still alive, leave.\" Stu was confused. \"That doesn't make sense. If I killed someone, why would you know that I've changed?\" Keifer sighed. \"Just get on with it Stu. We don't have all day.\" \"No, I'm not going to kill anyone. Not some random guy who you've picked from the street and definitely not my own sister!\" A sudden change came over Keifer and he walked over to stand above Derek's snivelling form. \"You think that Derek here,\" he gave him a kick, almost as if to emphasise his point, \"is just some random guy that I picked up off the street. Oh, no. What would be in that? Didn't I tell you? He's selfish, a liar and he uses people. Do you want to know what he did that made me want him?\" Stu didn't answer him but of course he still continued. \"He's what's called a porn king. He thinks that he's got a great website going. At least that's what he tells everyone on the phone. I clicked on it and you don't want to know what I found. Turns out that he's not an artist as he continues to say that he is. He's nothing but a dirty paedophile. He snatches girls off the street and says that he's going to kill them unless they take their clothes off and lets him take pictures.\" He turned to look briefly at Emily before turning and looking meaningfully at Stu. \"Most of them are no older then seventeen. The same age as Emily.\" As Stu looked down at the man on the floor he saw him in a completely different light. The suit that before had looked expensive despite the rips in it, now just looked dirty. That suit had been bought with dirty money. \"Don't you see Stu? He deserves to die. Kill him Stu, go on. If you kill him then both you and Emily can go home. It will be as if nothing ever happened.\" In that brief moment Stu actually contemplated killing the man. It was no different from what Keifer had previously done. Maybe there was something right in it. If Derek was off the streets then surely it would be better. However all these thoughts were gone when Emily spoke up. \"You don't have to do this Stu. You're better then him.\" He looked down at Emily and saw the pure confidence and love that she felt for him. \"Yes,\" he said, agreeing with what she said. \"I don't have to do this,\" and with that he threw the gun to the floor. Keifer sighed and walked over to the window. Stu saw what he was going to do before he did it but he didn't have the strength in him to move and stop him. Keifer picked up the sniper rifle from the stand and aimed it at Emily. \"Kill Derek or I'll have no choice but to kill Emily.\" Emily started crying as she stared up at the gun aimed at her. \"No!\" Stu shouted, taking a step forwards. He couldn't stand to see his sister cry and he definitely didn't want her to get hurt. \"Stay where you are Stu. You don't want to risk your little sister getting hurt now, do you?\" Keifer moved a step closer to Emily, as if to prove his point. \"Don't hurt her, please. Just let her go. She's nothing to do with this.\" \"No Stu. Don't you see? She's everything to do with this. I want to know how much you've changed. Before you didn't care about anybody. Now, let's see if you care about your sister enough to kill a man. I personally think that it shouldn't be too hard for you. I can see that killing streak in you.\" \"I don't have a killing streak and I don't want to kill anyone.\" \"Oh, but you don't have a choice. So Stu, who's it going to be? Emily, your sister, who's never done anything wrong or Derek, a paedophile. Take your pick.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Emily Emily was terrified not only for herself but for her brother as well. Keifer was asking her brother to kill a man and if he didn't then she would be shot. Of course she didn't want to die, but then again she didn't want Stu to kill a man. Sure, the man had done some awful things but that didn't mean he deserved to die. Another reason that she didn't want Stu to shoot Derek was because she knew that it would tear him up inside. He wouldn't be able to cope with the fact that he'd killed a man. That is if Keifer ever let her and Stu go. For a moment Emily had thought that she'd managed to stop Stu from killing Derek but then Keifer had spoke up. Now that Emily had actually spoken and met the man she could see why Stu became so messed up after the whole Phonebooth situation. Keifer fucked with your mind, making you act in ways that you don't want to. He was speaking right now, giving Stu a final ultimatum. \"So Stu, who's it going to be? Emily, your sister, who's never done anything wrong or Derek, a paedophile. Take your pick.\" Stu looked so confused that Emily's heart went out for him. She hated Keifer right then. Then she saw Stu looking down at the gun and she saw a flash of excitement run through his eyes. Now she was confused. Why was he excited? He was going to be forced to kill a man. Then she thought about it. Maybe Stu had missed this. Maybe he'd missed all of this action. 'No.' Mentally she shook her head. How could he have missed the fear? He could have lost his life that day. No one would have missed that. Emily brought herself back to the situation at hand and noticed that Stu was talking. \"You promise that if I kill this man you'll let both Emily and I go?\" Kiefer nodded. \"And you promise that you'll believe that I've changed and that you'll never speak to us again?\" \"Of course Stu.\" Emily knew that Keifer was lying the moment he spoke. However Stu didn't seem to see this. He was blinded by all of his emotions. She watched, shocked, as Stu held up the gun and pointed it at Derek. \"Come on Stu,\" Keifer muttered, still smiling. \"Do it!\" \"No,\" Emily said to Stu. \"Don't do it.\" \"Shut up,\" Keifer hissed at her from across the room. \"No!\" she repeated, shouting it this time. She was talking to Stu now. \"You can't just kill someone, even if they have done things wrong. Then you'd just be like him.\" She gave a quick glance to Keifer before looking back at Stu. He didn't look as certain anymore but he was still holding the gun. \"Just put down the gun. Please.\" Derek, on the floor, was nodding his head, agreeing with what Emily was saying. \"But he'll kill you. I can't let him do that,\" Stu said, ignoring Derek. Emily had forgotten about what Keifer had said. Stu had to kill the man or Keifer would kill her. However looking at Keifer she wondered if he would kill her. He didn't seem like the kind of man who would kill someone for no reason. Sure, he'd threatened Stu several times by saying that he'd kill people. For example he said that he'd kill Pam and Kelly. However he never went through with it. It was all just a case of whether she truly believed that he wouldn't kill her. For now however she didn't voice her thoughts. She trusted that Stu would do the right thing. Stu Stu was in an incredibly difficult situation. He had two choices. One seemed to be too ridiculous to think of, whilst the other seemed to be the more obvious choice to choose. Keifer wanted him to kill Derek. There was no way that he was going to let Keifer kill Emily so he had no choice. That, at least, was his first thought. Then he started to notice the way that Emily was looking at Keifer and he could tell that she didn't believe what he was saying. The way her eyebrows were slightly raised and the frown on her face were too familiar for Stu not to see what she was thinking. Why would Emily not believe Keifer's threats? Did she not remember how he had almost been killed by this man? Keifer must have started to become impatient because he shouted out, interrupting Stu's train of thought. \"That's it Stu. You have thirty seconds to kill Derek or its goodbye Emily.\" He raised the gun higher and pointed it at Emily's head to prove his point. \"30 – 29 – 28- 27-\" \"Stop it!\" Stu screamed, clutching his head in his hands. The gun felt good pressing against the side of his head. That was when he realised what he had to do. How could he not have thought of it before? It was all so simple. \"I know what to do,\" he muttered, looking at Emily. She must've seen something in his eyes that she didn't like because she told him not to do anything stupid. He ignored what she said because he knew that what he was about to do wasn't stupid. All of his problems would be sorted. Slowly he raised the gun in the air. However, instead of pointing it at Derek, Emily or even Keifer, he pointed it at himself. \"What are you doing?\" Emily shouted out at him, struggling against the rope that tied her to the chair. \"Don't you dare Stu!\" \"It makes sense Emily,\" he told her, trying not to show any emotion. He wanted this to be as painless as possible for her. Whilst they'd been talking Keifer had still been counting. \"10-9-8-7-\" Stu didn't look at him, not wanting his smug face to be the last thing he saw. \"3-2-1-\" With one last breath he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger...[Chapter 6] A/N: Thank you so much for the reviews for this story. I'm so sorry about the long time some of you have had to wait for this chapter. I haven't posted anything on fanfiction for about six months now and I'd lost this chapter so I had to write it again. But here it is, finally. Also, just to let you know that I've changed some minor grammar etc in some chapters, so it's up to you if you want to go back through and read previous chapters. Chapter 6 Stu Stu didn't look at him, not wanting his smug face to be the last thing he saw. \" 3-2-1-\" With one last breath he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger... ... only for nothing to happen. He opened his eyes and looked at the gun, before opening it up. There were no bullets loaded. Keifer started laughing and Stu looked angrily over at him. \"What the fuck?\" Stu asked him, throwing the gun to the floor. \"You really think I'd give you a loaded gun Stu? Do I look stupid?\" Stu was too consumed with anger to answer him. Instead he looked over at Emily and saw that she was taking deep breaths. A look of relief was on her face. \"What are you going to do now then?\" Stu asked Keifer, clenching his hands into fists. \"You didn't kill Derek, so I have no choice but to kill Emily.\" \"What?\" he asked angrily. \"How could I have killed him when the gun wasn't even loaded?\" \"Oh but you had the opportunity to kill him and you didn't. You were going to kill yourself. I never said you could do that. Therefore Emily has to die.\" With that Keifer held up the rifle and pointed it at Emily before pulling the trigger. Stu shouted out and ran forwards but it was too late. A loud bang echoed throughout the room and Emily slumped forwards in her chair as the bullet came into contact with her side. Stu was crying as he ran forwards and held Emily in his arms. \"No!\" he shouted, shaking her gently. He was so lost in his emotions that he didn't notice Keifer was laughing until he'd been clinging onto Emily for a few minutes. \"You bastard!\" he screamed at Keifer. He let go of Emily and ran over to Keifer, punching him in the face. Keifer simply laughed and moved away from him. \"She's not dead Stu.\" Stu just stood there, breathing hard. He didn't believe him. He said as much. \"Go Stu. Look at her. Where's the blood?\" Stu didn't believe Keifer but he had to check anyway. Almost as if in a dream he walked over to Emily. When he touched her he gasped as he realised that she wasn't cold. Her body was warm, meaning that she couldn't be dead. \"You shot her? Why is she not dead?\" he asked. \"Look at her side.\" Stu gently lifted up Emily's shirt and saw that there wasn't a bullet lodged in her side but a small needle. Obviously Keifer had shot her with some kind of sedative. As he realised this Stu collapsed to his knees in relief and started sobbing. He'd been so worried that Emily had been dead. Footsteps came towards him but he was too wrapped up in his emotions. A hand came down on his shoulder and he looked up to see Keifer standing above him. \"You've done well. I'm proud.\" Suddenly he grabbed him and shoved him up against the wall. \"But what you've got to understand Stu, is that you only have one life. And you are wasting it.\" The anger was clear on Keifers face. \"I've been like you before. Weak. Hopeless. Feeling like you have nothing to live for. But you've got your whole life ahead of you. Don't waste it.\" He let go of Stu and walked over to stand next to Derek. \"You didn't have to do all of this to get your point across,\" Stu muttered cautiously. \"I'm not so sure. You can move on with your life now without worrying about me. I'll leave you and Emily alone and let you live your lives.\" He pointed to the door. \"You're free to go.\" Stu looked over at Derek, who was kneeling on the floor. \"What's going to happen to him?\" Keifer smirked. \"Don't worry about him. He'll get his comeuppance.\" He didn't question him any further, not wanting to know the details. He watched warily as Keifer walked over to Emily before taking a knife out of his pocket. Just as Stu was about to tell him to leave her alone, he cut the rope that was tying her to the chair. \"Take Emily and get out of here.\" Stu didn't need to be told twice. Shakily he got to his feet and took Emily in his arms. He was glad that she wasn't too heavy because otherwise he probably would have dropped her. Most of his strength seemed to have gone. He looked back one last time, taking in Keifer's and Derek's faces before walking out of the room and down the corridor. Within a few minutes he managed to locate a door that led outside and he opened it up. He blinked as he came out into bright sunlight. It was good to know that he knew where he was. It wouldn't take long to get back home. Looking down at Emily he gave a small smile to her unconscious form before walking off in the direction of home. He was ready for his new life. After Stu and Emily had left Keifer picked up the rifle and shot Derek in the head. He didn't have the time to torture him as much as he wanted. After Derek was dead he sat on the floor of his room and clutched his head in his hands. No matter how calm and collected he felt, killing someone always exhausted him mentally. He knew they deserved it. They all did. If he had the time and the patience he'd kill every piece of scum on this earth. But he didn't. So instead he had to settle for the few people he could find. And even as he grew older and weaker he knew that he would never stop killing those who deserved it. Because he had a duty. He'd let Stu go because he'd changed. He was the only man Keifer would find who had potential for change. He would go on to kill over thirty people and yet Stu was the only one who had managed to stop himself being killed. And it wasn't because he was clever. It was because he was lucky. Because Keifer would never stop. Those who raped. Those who murdered. Those who lied. Those who cheated. Those who didn't deserve life. Those who didn't appreciate it. He was coming for them. He was coming for all of them. And they were going to die. And Keifer couldn't help but laugh at that thought. A/N: What did you think about the end? I've also started writing a fanfiction about 'Keifer' and his background because I feel like we don't get told anything about his previous life or why he is who he is. And I think it would be interesting. So tell me whether you'd be interested in reading this in your review :) Thanks once again for being so patient and I apologise.

Their first date is finished .. Stuntook Ronny back to her building .. In front of the door .. Ronny : ''nThank you so much for the amazing night '' Stu : '' That's it ! .. just thank youn.. no presents ? '' Ronny laughed then she gave him a kissnon the cheek .. But while she was kissing him Stuart turned his headnand kissed her ( It was so charming ) Stu : '' You are so welcome '' Ronny started blushing .. Stu : '' Son.. see you tomorrow ? '' Ronny : '' Of course .. call me '' Stu : '' Sure thing .. Goodnightndarling '' Ronny '' Sweet dreams Stuart '' .. Stu and Ronny felt very happy thatnnight and each one of them kept thinking about the other one andndreaming of the next day.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 7 : HAPPY DAY THE NEXT MORNING .. IN STUART'S HOUSE ... Stu's brother just got up went to the kitchen and found Stu there ... Stu in a joyful voice : '' Good morning big brother .. it's a lovely day, don't you think ?

Stu picked up the phone and called his girl Ronny ... Ronny : '' Hello '' Stu : '' Hey baby Good morning '' Ronny with a joyful voice : '' STU !! Good morning .. I'm happy to hear your voice first thing in the morning '' Stu : '' Well unfortunately my brother's sleepy voice was the first thing to hear i the morning and it's not that good '' Ronny laughed ... Stu : '' God knows how much I love that laugh ! '' Ronny blushing ... Stu : '' Sweetie can you come to my house for breakfast please ? '' Ronny smiled and said : I'd love to .. I just have to get ready first so it might take some time is that ok with you ? '' Stu : '' Oh babe take all the time you want '' What Stu was thinking was to do something very special for his girl besides the delicious breakfast ..[Chapter 8] CHAPTER 8 : RED ROSES THE DOOR BELL ... Ronny was there but the door never got opened ! While Ronny took her cell phone out of her purse to call Stu she noticed a little note on the door that says : '' Make my day by coming inside '' She smiled then opened the door and found trail of red rose petals with small heart shape candles leading to the bedroom and when she went there she found Hershey's kisses in a heart shape were placed on the bed and in the middle of the chocolate heart kisses there was a note saying : '' close your beautiful eyes '' Ronny got very excited and closed her eyes .. and the minute she did she felt that there was someone standing right behind her Stu gave her a hug from her back and started to kiss her neck over and over again .. Ronny was giggling and was very pleased so Stu carried her ... '' Oh my God Stu what are doing ? '' Ronny said. Stu : '' Shush ... Sweetie just lean your head over my shoulder '' He took her down the stairs and she noticed the Red rose petals on every step. Then they entered the dining room and the lights were off there was just the candles light and there was a table with delicious breakfast and a little box on the corner ... there was romantic music too. Ronny : '' OH MY GOD STUART !!! '' Stu was smiling and acting dumb : '' What ? '' Ronny : '' OH MY GOD STUART !!! '' '' Ok .. moving to the next step .. YOU CAN DO IT RONNY !! '' Stu was joking Ronny laughed then she gave him a kiss ( a long emotional one ) after the kiss they both left their eyes closed for a few seconds then Ronny bit into her lips , opened her eyes and smiled Stu opened his eyes sighs then said : '' OK now you see Ronny we are making a great progress '' They both laughed so much .. Ronny : '' Now can you put me down please ? '' Stu : '' What if I didn't ? '' Ronny : '' You'll never gonna get something special from me '' joking of course ! Stu immediately put her down !! They laughed so much then Stu kissed her and Ronny's arms were around his neck He took her from her hand and led her to the table .. pulled the chair for Ronny and said : '' Miss .. '' Ronny sat down then said : '' Thank you Sir '' Stu gave her a quick kiss on the cheek then went to his seat '' Yummy it looks delicious ! '' Ronny said Stu : '' Thanks but you can't eat until I do some prayers '' Ronny : '' OK ! .. sure '' They gathered their hands and Stu : '' Thank you God for this amazing grace and I don't mean just the food '' then he looked at Ronny and found her looking at him and was very touched. . . AFTER THEY ATE THEIR BREAKFAST ... Ronny was wiping her face with the corner of the napkin then said : '' Stu this is so delicious I loved it .. have you ever cooked before ? '' Stu : '' Well I'm glad that you did and yes I have cooked before just once though '' Stu took the little box and gave it to Ronny Ronny : '' What's this ? '' Stu : '' Believe me it's nothing .. it's just a gift to prove something to you '' Ronny had the strange look then when she opened the box she found a mirror and a card sticked on it saying : '' in this mirror you'll see the image of the most beautiful woman in the world. '' Then she looked at the mirror and of course she found her image ! .. She left the mirror and the box on the table, stood up and went to Stu and said to him in a low voice : '' I can't believe that you just did that .. I can't believe how perfect you are How sweet and lovable .. Thank you so much sweetie '' Stu : '' Hey you finally called me sweetie '' Ronny smiled : '' Now I know what it really means '' then she gave him a kiss ...

It was a summer morning and I started to awake to the sound of birds chirping outside of my window as the light started beaming in through the curtains I just put up. I laid in my bed and felt this feeling of comfort as his arms were wrapped tightly around me as he slept. I buried my head more into his chest and looked up at him slightly. His facial features were so distracting to me. I was in love with every detail that he contained. We were together for a few months now and I was as happy as I could ever been. High school seemed like a memory that was easy to slip by when we were together. It was just a part of our lives that seemed to vanish. The only memory that really mattered was MORP. It was the time we got together. When that happened, things started to feel more right. I no longer had to hide myself from my classmates and I let the shyness escape. I also got the guy who made my heart beat rapidly. It was such an unreal feeling, but when I opened my eyes this morning and saw him, I was reminded of the truth. I placed one of my hands on his chest, which was covered by his blue t-shirt. I loved the feeling of his heartbeat under it. The fact that I was in it still boggled my mind. I was totally in love. It was something I never experienced before and it was even better than I imagined. I lifted my other hand and ran it gently through his curly hair. I then heard him mumble \"mhm\" and I knew he was starting to wake up. \"Good morning, sleepyhead,\" I said gently and kept stroking his hair back. His eyes slowly started to flutter open and I couldn't leave my eyes from him. I then leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to those lips of his. They were soft and welcoming as he responded. I was just addicted to all of him. He then pulled away a bit and brushed our lips together and I closed my eyes softly as I got this chill sent down my spine. \"It's the best type of morning, Sweet T,\" he mumbled into it and pecked my lips again. The slightest touch made my body just ignite. He pressed our heads together and I kept my eyes closed and took in a deep breath of relaxation. My hand ran up his chest as I went by his muscles and placed it on his cheek. We just laid there in comfort as he refused to let go of me. Being in his arms made me melt so easily. I had a place to belong there. The thing I loved about Gavin is that he knew how to take it slow with me. He knew that this was my first relationship and never made me feel pressured to do anything. He made sure I never felt nervous and uncomfortable. The biggest thing with him is that he wanted me to feel wanted and it worked. He cared for me as a person, which meant a lot. I remember always overhearing at school how guys would just use a girl for other \"activities\", but Gavin wasn't like that. He had this sincerity about him. Gavin and I had a few sleepovers together, but it was nothing more than cuddling at night. We both were at the same pace and wanted our relationship to blossom. We wanted to go slow like we did the entire time. We didn't want to rush it and risk screwing something up. Last night, he came over and we stayed up late laughing and talking as music played from the computer. We laid in bed together and snuggled under the covers as we discussed music, talked about our stories, and our desires. It was just so relaxed when we were together. We just never felt forced to say something or do something when we were together. \"Can we just stay here all day?\" He said as he started to place gentle kisses on my cheeks. I giggled and couldn't stop. The smile on my face was so wide my cheeks began to feel numb. \"That's very tempting…\" I managed to get out of my throat through delightful giggles. Life seemed perfect. An aroma of foods started drifting all the way up to my room as it slid under the crack of the door. \"I'm gonna go see what's going on downstairs. I'll bring up some food, alright?\" Gavin then nodded unwillingly and slowly let go of his grip on me. \"Make it quick, please…\" He said softly and pressed his lips once more to my cheek. I got up and ran downstairs to where my mother was standing over the island making breakfast for Rob as he sat in his usual chair at the table reading the newspaper. \"Morning, Mom and Rob,\" I stated as I went over to the table to grab some orange juice. Rob gave me a nod of acknowledgement and mumbled something that I wasn't able to make out. He was too focused on what he was reading to give me his full attention. He was usually like that in the mornings, anyways. It was just the routine at this point. \"Morning, honey,\" she stated, but there was something off in her tone. She was avoiding eye contact and the smile she always wore plastered to her face was diminishing. I got this strange feeling from her. \"Everything okay, Mom?\" I asked her curiously with some worry in my voice. Seeing her like this became abnormal to me. The only time she was ever this weird was when there was something going on she was afraid to tell me. \"Well, I just got off the phone with your father…\" Those words made me tense up a bit. I had a good relationship with my father, but he also could be very judgemental. The last conversation I had with him on the phone was about how he wanted me to do something more important with my life besides working on a radio show. He always wanted me to become a businesswoman or a lawyer, but that was never my thing. We were always opposite that way. That conversation ended up with me hanging the phone up on him. Hopefully, he wasn't calling to criticize my mom on the way she is parenting me because I stood up firm to him. He was always used to getting his way when it came to me, but I have to stop letting people control me. \"Oh….wonderful,\" I didn't know what to say, so I just took a sip of my juice. I looked down at the clear glass and the liquid moving inside of it. Talking about him was the last thing I wanted to do at the moment. \"He told me that he's planning to come home soon...He's planning to stay in the hotel in the middle of town.\" Like that, my heart dropped. Hanging up on the phone was one thing, but ignoring him in real life was going to be harder than I thought. He was coming back home to Seattle to make sure he got his way. \"Great…\" I said through my teeth. After everything I've been through, I got this nervousness and anxiety building up within me. He only remembers me as what I was before I left, not what I am now. This summer was going to get out of hand real fast.[Chapter 2] Radio Rebel: The Changing Summer Weather Chapter 2: We Meet Again I do not own any of the characters. I trudged my way back upstairs and ran my fingers through my hair in aggravation. I walked in my room, shut the door and just wanted to lock myself away. Gavin then sat up on the bed and looked over at me with concern in his eyes. \"What's wrong? Come here,\" Like that, he knew it. I walked over to him and he pulled me into bed next to him and wrapped me up. I sighed heavily. The return of the anxiety I had my entire life came back to me. Just one little moment and it threw me. I buried my head into Gavin's chest as he stroke my back repeatedly trying to bring me back to sanity. He started placing kisses on the crown of my head. \"My dad's coming to town…\" Like that, Gavin got the message. He then shook his head and it all made sense to him. I told him the other night about the conversation I had with my dad and he listened completely. Gavin's parents happened to be music teachers at the middle school and elementary school, so he didn't go through the things I am, but I could tell in his eyes he was trying to understand. I could see the sympathy he had for me. I could see how he desired to have all the good things in life for me. \"Why do I get the feeling he's going to force things on you when he comes?\" Gavin said in a stern tone. He was getting protective and I could already tell that he wasn't the biggest fan of my father. To be honest, I wasn't either anymore, lately. \"Because you are exactly right,\" I said under my breath and he kept rubbing my back trying to comfort me. He pushed my hair back with one of his hands and our eyes lined up with one another. I looked in his brown eyes and I felt this calmness come back to me. \"It's gonna be okay, love. Your mom supports you, Rob supports you, Audrey supports you and I support you. He's not even in your life. He never sees how capable you are. When he comes, he will have to change his mind,\" Gavin stated then leaned in and left a kiss on my lips. I smiled against them because I knew he was right, but for some reason, I couldn't help thinking that things were going to backfire when he came. He then pulled away and pressed our noses together. His gentleness and care for people, not only me, was what I loved most about him. \"Thank you, Gavin…\" I got out softly. \"Don't worry about it, Tara...I just wanna make sure you're okay and be here for you. I love you. A lot,\" He said looking in my eyes. I could hear the authenticity of his words by his tone and by his eyes. You could tell Gavin meant something the most when you saw it in his eyes. He had a way of working them. \"I love you, too,\" My heart started bursting with butterflies, \"a lot.\" He leaned in and pecked my lips with love. That magnetic and electric feeling came again. \"So, when is he coming?\" \"In a few days...He's not even here yet, yet I'm stressed out about it.\" \"Just relax, babe. I'm here,\" he said in a shushing whisper and planted a few more kisses on my lips, \"Breathe, okay? He might change his mind. We don't know yet. We'll cross that road when it comes,\" I nodded in comprehension. \"Will you come to the airport with me to get him? I doubt my mom will want to go see him. The divorce between them wasn't the nicest thing to hear. It mostly existed in phone conversations when he was traveling, though…,\" I said having my voice drown out as a bunch of flashbacks of the conversations ran through my head. A flashback of the raising voices. Having my mother raise her voice was definitely a thing I rarely heard. I remember how she cried in her bedroom and shut the door as tight as she could. It was all memories of an awful time. \"Of course, I will...and I will also try my best to have him like me,\" Gavin stated trying to lighten the moment. There was something about him that always made me smile even when I didn't want to. \"Trust me, I'm still trying for his approval, Gav,\" he and I both laughed softly. \"What about you, your dad and I all go out to eat one night? Maybe I can help you change his mind,\" he said with a charming smile. I nodded immediately, even though part of me didn't want anything to do with my dad, but at this point, I knew it was unavoidable. \"We'll make it through this week….right?\" I asked quietly. He then nodded. \"We'll definitely try. It'll work out. Trust me. Just don't worry about it now.\" The next few days passed and I spent it doing what I usually do. Hanging out with Gavin, Larry, Barry and Audrey, of course. We went bowling, out for pizza and hung out in the pool in my backyard. My dad was coming in later tonight and it was Gavin and I's job to pick him up. My mother was making small complaints about his arrival all day. And the day before that. And before that. There was a reason why they got a divorce, after all. They could act civil with each other if they were forced to speak, but all in all, there was still some distance there. Some conflict underneath all the layers that they hide. Gavin and I got in his car and started driving towards the airport. I rested my arm against the side of the door and ran a hand through my hair as the wind from the open window pushed it back. All of a sudden, I felt a pressure on my hand. I looked down at it and saw Gavin's fingers pressing my hand up against his palm. I smiled at it. He knew I had a bunch of things running through my mind right now. I looked at him and kissed his shoulder gently as he drove. There was something about him that could ease my troubles in a moment in time. We pulled into the airport and parked the car. Gavin didn't know what my father looked like, so my eyes were out. I wasn't looking forward to seeing his judgemental looks and the tone in his voice that made me question everything about who I was. The tone that made me nervous. I squeezed Gavin's hand a little tighter as the tension of this moment started to rise. I had to put on my best smile and pretend I was fine. I had to make it through these few days ahead of me. I had to stand strong. I had to let him know what I stood for and that I wasn't going to change for him. Hopefully, facing him didn't swipe all that away. It was always different on the phone because I couldn't see his face. Now I was the girl in plain sight and was no longer hiding behind something. I then saw a man with orange hair like the color of mine swept back. He was wearing one of the suits and had his suitcase following closely behind. I sighed at the sight and started to get out of the car. I waved him over to the car and he walked over with a stern expression on his face and a slight smile. I went in for a hug and he hugged back. \"There's my little girl,\" he stated with a smile. He was the exact opposite of my mother. If my mom was without me, she would be all over me, but my dad and I….things weren't the same. I can't say it was completely awful when he was around. He was a good dad on occasions. Even though he could be hard sometimes, when he came back from all of his trips, we would have fun. We would talk about certain movies, books and things I was interested in. Ever since he went away and the divorce, things just grew worst. As I let go of him, my fathers eyes then darted to Gavin. I could tell that he was analyzing him. I could tell he was trying to find something off about him. Gavin then put out his band and gave him one of the sparkling smiles of his. \"Hello, Sir. I'm Gavin,\" My father looked at his hand for a moment deciding whether or not to shake it. Gavin still smiled politely and I could tell he was getting nervous, though. His hand was still there just waiting for my father. My father then grabbed his hand and shook it. \"Nice to meet you, Gavin. I expect you're treating my little girl right,\" He said looking in Gavin's eyes. Gavin then nodded and smiled. \"The best to my ability, Sir.\" \"I see…Well, don't forget there's also always room for improvement,\" And there was the hit. I then wrapped my arm around Gavin and rubbed his back. I could tell he didn't know what to say so he just smiled weakly then opened the trunk of the car for my father's belongings. It wasn't in Gavin to start a controversy. I had to say something to my dad. \"Gavin is doing a wonderful job. He actually had a really good idea. He was hoping all of us could out to dinner at this restaurant him and his band is playing at,\" \"That sounds delightful,\" My father said with a smile stretched out on his face. I could see the cogs working in his mind. I knew this was going to be a night of his loud opinions.[Chapter 3] Radio Rebel: The Changing Summer Weather Chapter 3: Making A Point I do not own any of the characters The car ride was uncomfortable. Well, uncomfortable doesn't seem the right word for what it actually was. It definitely broke new standards of the word. Gavin sat in the drivers seat with my father in the passenger and I sat in the back. Gavin would put on a song or any radio station at all and my father would make a criticism of it. He loved calling it all \"noise\". Eventually, Gavin turned it off and I could see he was getting more nervous and somewhat irritated by the red headed man. I could see him wondering how my father would respond to the music that he and the guys played. I already wasn't enjoying his company back to Seattle. I always imagined seeing him again would be different, but he left as the same bitter man. Everytime he made an insult of something, I tried my best to change his mind. Of course, he was stubborn and stuck in his ways. Gavin finally parked the car and got out his guitar. He ran in early to place it on the stage and said he would meet us at our table before his band went on. You could tell he was trying with it all. I looked at my father and there was some clear boundaries between us. \"I think we should have a table close to the stage…Gavin made sure we did,\" I said in attempt to break the tension. The silence was getting overwhelming for me. My father nodded and showed no emotion in his face. He was like a wall to me. We got inside and the room was dimly lit. The circular tables were placed all around the stage, which was located in the center of the room. On each table, a candle was placed in the center as a white cloth fell beneath it and draped over the edges of the table. There were albums hung up on the wall and guitars placed diagonally against the walls. The music in the background varied from all different genres. Some were even local bands, which was awesome. Hearing what some of the artists that were playing on the stage tonight had prepared made me fill with excitement. I looked over my father who was doing what he usually did. Analyze. I sighed as I waited for his snarky comment. In 1, 2, 3… \"This place is certainly not as elegant as it should be…How does this place receive any type of service?\" I ignored him. Letting him stew in his bitterness was better than having a worthless disagreement. I went up to the hostess and told her our reservation name. She then directed us to a table that Gavin was already sitting at. My father followed behind observing the crowd. He stuck his nose up at people and I could see him classifying everyone. As we came over, Gavin stood up and pulled out the chair for me. I smiled at him, kissed his cheek and said thank you. He then went for the chair next to me, but it was immediately swiped by my father. He looked down at the chair that was just stolen uncomfortably. \"Okay, then…\" I heard him slightly mumble under his breath. My father was being an ass and I couldn't stand it. He knew exactly what he was doing. Gavin then walked to the other side of the table and sat next to me there. I grabbed his hand under the table and he squeezed it. He knew what I was thinking of. He knew how awful I felt inside. He could read me like a book. \"So, Gavin. Do you have any plans for the next few years of your life?\" Here was the time that my father began to peg us with questions. I could feel Gavin's hand become a bit more sweaty in my mine. \"Yeah, I'm planning to go to college to study in music and education. My parents are music teachers, so I was hoping to do something in that area, in case things doesn't work out with the band, I guess,\" Gavin stated as strongly as he could. His leg started bouncing up and down and I then took my foot and started to rub it against his leg to calm him. I felt his muscles relax a bit more at the gentle touch. \"I see...Considering the economy now, a teaching job won't really get you that far. I mean, I'm sure your parents do well for themselves, but lets think about this, in four years, you'll graduate college...How many teaching jobs will be open, by then? And with budget cuts some schools are making, do you really think the music department will have a chance? Let's just think logically about this for a second…\" My mouth became gaped. I couldn't believe he was doing this. Gavin just looked shocked as he tried to process what my father just came out and said. \"Actually, Dad, I think what Gavin is planning to do with his life is great. Sure, education departments are hard to get into considering the circumstances today, but I believe in my boyfriend. He is so capable,\" I finally stepped in through nervous breaths. I could feel Gavin becoming tense again. His face was stern and the smile that I once knew so well seemed to be gone. It was such an odd sight to me. I played with his fingers in mine and tried to calm him. I laced ours together to give him the reminder that I was there. My father looked at me with surprise with what I said. What he spoke wasn't worth ignoring that time. \"Well, Tara, I just want to help the boy. Just like how I want to help you. You really should do something more worthy with life than hosting a radio show for the rest of your days. I know you're young and it's fun and games now, but you need to major in something important when you go off to college. You really should take my advice. You can get a lot of money in business working for a company. And as a lawyer...Are you aware of how much money they make? It's long hours, but that won't matter in the long run. What will matter is that you will be supplying yourself and your family, if you ever decide to have one. Working on the radio show is just a fantasy. It's one of those things that will have an expiration date,\" he stated trying to get his point across. I ignored his words. I hated that he was shooting these things at me. Now that he was doing it to my face, I didn't know how to react. His words were poison and they just kept seeping into my skin. The poison traveled into my veins, in the bloodstream until it hit my heart. Every word he spoke was just another blow. \"Well, you obviously haven't seen the reviews Tara has gotten for the show, then. You may think her life is a fantasy, but it's not to those listeners. Their lives are being changed. I thought it was a father's job to support their child or children?\" Gavin stated. All of a sudden, I heard Gavin's band called to the stage. Perfect timing before that got out of hand. My father looked at me stunned at what Gavin just said. \"Did he really just talk to me like that? Tara, if your boyfriend doesn't respect your father, he's clearly not the guy you should be with. What does he know about parenting? I sure hope he doesn't speak to you that way,\" This was definitely not a night I wanted to remember… Gavin, Gabe, and the rest of the boys took the stage. Gavin looked over at me and gave me a slight smile. He felt my fathers eyes land on him and then darted his eyes down to his guitar. Gabe walked over the mic and started with his introduction. \"Hello, Seattle. I hope you're all having a good night in this wonderful restaurant. We wanted to give a big thank you to the owner Mr. Monahan for giving us an opportunity to play up here for you wonderful people. We are The GGGG's and here's some of our stuff,\" Gabe stated and the crowd started clapping for them all. I went to a lot of the boys band practices lately and they were getting even better in the past few months. Gabe started listening to some of Gavin's ideas after MORP and they worked things out. They decided to do a balance of fun and meaningful. Something you can dance with and have a good time and something you can also think about. Their songs were getting really impressive as soon as they all started to collaborate and let their opinions be heard between one another. They started to play one of their new songs called \"Radiant\" and I started to tap my foot to it under the table. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw my dad on his cell phone. I sighed at the disrespect. He was just completely stuck in his ways.[Chapter 4] Radio Rebel:The Changing Summer Weather Chapter 4 : Silent I do not own \"Radio Rebel\" or the characters. The GGGG's were playing song after the song. Everytime they thought they were going to go off stage to end the show for the night, the crowd kept pleading for more. Their voices would echo through the small vicinity and you could hear their love for the sound vibrating off of the instruments speakers. I looked up at my boyfriend under the hot lights and couldn't be prouder. He had this big grin on his face and beads of sweat coming down his forehead. He would occasionally push his hair back to get it out of his way and I couldn't stop paying attention to him. He was in his moment and every ounce of me was speechless. I've watched him do shows before, but there was just something about seeing the person you love in their element. He was in his zone and I could tell every worry he had before he got up there was extinguished. Everything in his body was electric. Before he would go up, he would be tense. He would feel nervous and I especially don't blame him by the way tonight was going, but I truly believed that the stage was where he belonged. The match within him was ignited into a burning raging fire of passion. Right now, my father was outside having a smoke. I knew he was getting frustrated at how involved I was in the music aspect. And I knew that it didn't make him happy that I was dating someone who loved it just as much as I did. He was ignorant and arrogant. He was so absorbed in what he believed. Most of the things he preached was twisted. I don't think I can recall one time where he said he had faith in who I was. He never gave me any words of encouragement. The parts of him that I once loved had just faded and turned rotten until the core become black itself. \"I hate to say it because you guys have been treating us extremely well tonight, but that's our last song,\" the crowd started making groans of unhappiness. I laughed a bit seeing how into the band they were. \"Hey, hey. Don't worry. The music for the night isn't over. You have more great bands coming up. Thank you for the great night. We really appreciate your support. Next up, here's Magnetic Graffiti,\" Gabe stated and the boys started to put together their equipment as the other band started bringing their stuff on the stage. Gavin met my eyes and they told me to follow him. I put down my fork from the meal I was chowing on and ran up the stairs to behind the stage to congratulate him. If my dad really wanted to find me, he could. Right now, it seemed as if he would rather be alone. As I walked behind the black curtains, I noticed Gavin putting the equipment onto the dolly to bring out to the van for the band. I ran up to him sneakily, tapped his shoulder and then he peeked his head around to see who it was. Once our eyes met, his body did a full rotation and I immediately placed a \"congratulations\" kiss on those soft lips of his. I wrapped my arms around his neck and he placed his hands on my waist. It was a small moment, but I felt happy. I pulled away and then left one last gentle kiss to his lips. \"Congratulations, babe,\" I whispered to his lips and I could feel him smile against mine. He then pulled away a bit more and looked in my eyes. \"Did you see how they kept begging for more? That was amazing. I can't believe that happened...It was such a rush!\" I giggled at his excitement. Every word that he stated was full of this powerful glee. \"You did great, hun,\" I pressed a kiss to his cheek then stroked back his hair. My fingers got lost in his slight curls and it just felt so peaceful. I could feel our bodies relaxing as we touched one another. \"Gavin!\" I heard Gabe's voice interrupting our moment. He then let go of my body, but still kept his arm around me. I leaned on his shoulder as we faced Gabe who was wearing jeans and a purple t-shirt. \"Guess what happened?! There's a man from a record label here who wants to sign and manage us. He saw how the audience couldn't get enough and think what we're playing could really go somewhere in the industry!\" All of a sudden, I saw Gavin's face filled with shock. Then I felt my mouth drop. I felt surprise come over me. I grabbed Gavin's arm a bit tighter and looked at him. He was just standing there processing. I laughed at his face of astonishment, placed my hand on his cheek then began pulling his face towards mine. \"You did it, babe. You did,\" I whispered as I looked in his eyes. He then started having a smile grow on his face and I pecked his lips. \"Okay, love birds, we need to go talk to this guy,\" Gabe said and we both turned our faces away from each other. Gabe then turned on his feet and we followed him off. I grabbed his hand and lead him over with Gabe. In front of us, stood a man in a white suit and shiny black shoes. He had long blonde hair that was pushed back and a smile filled with teeth that looked like a lion. He definitely had the music producer face. \"Hello, boys. My name is Mr. McCarthy with Jungle Records and I was hoping to give you guys a shot. I want to put you onto our label. We want you guys to come in and play a few songs. We can do a test drive. I'm sure the company head will see that you four having something special...That crowd certainly does,\" he stated as he shook each of our hands. I rubbed Gavin's back as he looked at the man in front of him. All of a sudden, I heard my fathers voice disturb the conversation that was occurring before us. \"There you are, Tara…,\" I closed my eyes in annoyance and turned to look at him. \"It's rude for you to run off like that without telling me. I had to make a waitress to look in the bathroom to see if you were in there!\" I sighed in annoyance. He always brought me down, but was always on me like a dog with a bone. \"Are you one of the proud parents of the band I'm about to sign?\" Mr. McCarthy stated directing his attention to my father with a big grin. My father looked at him with coldness in his eyes. \"You're going to sign these boys?\" My father started, \"What record company are you with?\" I shook nervously as he kept talking to the man in the suit. I had no idea where this was going to lead and how he would react. Whatever it was, it made every part of me freeze. I could feel the tension rise in my spine. \"Yes, I am. I'm Robert McCarthy with Jungle Records. You probably heard of us. We make dreams come true for young talent,\" My father kept stern and placed his hand in his jacket pocket. \"And you think these boys have what it takes? I'm sorry, but you're just taking away their choices. Their career will only last for so long. These boys...Have you heard them? Don't you think we have enough of their type of music on our radios!\" \"Dad, shut up!\" I exclaimed, but he kept going on his rant disregarding what I was saying. He was going to ruin this for them. He was going to ruin this… \"Jungle Records is a mess of a record company! My company has worked close with you people and I know how it all works. You people are corrupted!\" \"Hey, I was just taking advantage of the talent that everyone in the room clearly could see. But now that you mention it, maybe I shouldn't let these boys sign up to our company. We don't want to corrupt them, afterall,\" I then felt Gabe's eyes then shooting daggers into me. I grabbed my father's shoulder and then attempted pulling him away from the situation. \"It was nice meeting you, boys. Hopefully, you get a better agent,\" Before I knew it, the man was off. So was my boyfriend and his bands goal. I could see the light which colored Gavin's face started to become swiped. My mouth was wide open. Gabe clenched his teeth tightly and his arms started to move across his chest. He wasn't the open and fun guy that I saw on the stage anymore. \"Thanks a lot, Tara,\" There was a sound that familiar sound of bitterness and revulsion. That sound that rang in my head in the middle of the night. I heard it too much from so many people. I tried to apologize to Gabe, but before I knew it, he walked off with the other two boys behind him. The only people left standing were Gavin, my father and myself. The regret within me started to explode and started transitioning to this anger. I looked at my father dead in the eye and another person that crawled to the surface started to take over. \"I can't believe you just did that. All night, Gavin has been trying to make this a good evening for us. He wanted to get to know you and impress you. This is how you repay him for being so good to him? You know, Michael,\" I used his full name. Something I never did before. As far as I concerned, the role of father was non-existent. \"Take some money for a cab and find your own way to the hotel. I'm done with you. Only a few hours of having you back here in my life and I'm already sick,\" My father looked at me stunned. He dealt with me being quiet my entire life and me never standing up to him. He had no idea how to deal with this new person. I grabbed Gavin's hand tightly and pulled him off after grabbing his things. We walked out of the building and to Gavin's car. He got in the front seat and I got in the passenger seat. We waited in the parking lot for a moment just sitting there. There were no words to be said between us. \"Gavin…,\" I started nervously. The last thing I wanted was for him to hate me. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he would do that…I just...I'm sorry,\" I stated and he turned his view from the gray steering wheel to me. His face was blank. His eyes were filled with this hurt. He just looked completely broken hearted. He was wounded. \"It's fine, Tara…It's not your fault,\" he said with a sigh. The person sitting next to me was different. I never saw him like this and I didn't know what to do. \"I love you,\" he stated then leaned in and kissed my cheek. Even though he was clearly damaged, he still wanted to love me. Even though it was my father who ruined it for him. \"I love you, too,\" I leaned in and pecked his lips gently. \"Stay over with me tonight. I don't want you to be alone. I want to see your smile come back. I know what happened is more than dreadful, but I just wanna comfort you,\" I stated and stroked his cheek. He nodded with gloominess. No matter what attempt I made tonight at cheering him up, it wouldn't be fully fixed. It would just be temporary. Gavin started the car and we went down the road towards my house. I heard my phone ring and looked down and saw my father's number. Silent was the next button I pressed. The constant head butting between us was being put down to an end with tonight. Tonight was the last straw.[Chapter 5] Radio Rebel: The Changing Summer Weather Chapter 5: It Has To I do not own \"Radio Rebel\" or any of the characters. Gavin and I entered the house and headed up to my room. He was more quiet than usual and I honestly didn't blame him. Part of me felt responsible for it all. Part of me felt like I was the one who did this to him all because I didn't do what my stubborn father wanted. I mean, my father only came out because he wanted to persuade me to obey his orders. I was planning to talk to my mother about all of this that my so called father was doing. He wasn't even that involved in my life after the divorce yet he thinks he can waltz in and turn everything upside down. He thinks he can turn everything into only his liking. I wasn't sure what my mom was going to be able to, but it all was worth a try. Gavin laid in my bed and I pressed soft kisses to his cheek gently. He barely reacted. He just looked empty and drained. It was like his vessel was there and he physically was next to me, but everything else was wiped. His essence was evaporated. He was filled with this hopelessness. I sighed and crawled onto his chest. He wrapped his arms around me, as he always did, but there was this loss. \"I know you're upset. You can just tell me that. I'm sorry I screwed tonight up. I should have just done what my dad wanted me to when we were having those phone conversations I told you about. That way, him coming here would've been avoided. You getting that idea to go out with him and to get to know each other would have been avoided. You and the band missing your shot would've been avoided. I feel absolutely terrible right now. I wish I could say it wasn't any part of my fault, but it was. And I just want you to love me...because I love you. I can't lose you,\" I said quietly. This was the boy I was so in love with since the first Harry Potter movie. And I finally had him, yet it felt like it was going to disappear any moment. What we had was going to be tossed aside and was rusting away. Gavin shook his head at each word I was saying, but there was the part of me who still felt at fault. \"It's not, Tara. Stop thinking like that. You didn't put those thoughts in his mouth. He did it himself. Plus, I can always hope for another opportunity. We can just...just keep working towards it all,\" Gavin said in a tone that sounded like he was convincing himself. The doubt rang through my ears. I wanted to do everything to help him get where he wanted to go. A knock then came from my door and I got off of Gavin's chest immediately and sat up. My mom knew Gavin and I was close, but I still felt uncomfortable showing how affectionate we were towards one another in front of her. I sat up and Gavin then started to lay his head in my lap. I placed my hand through his curls and pulled on it occasionally as my fingers got entangled in them. His hair was soft and silky and I didn't want to let go of any part of him. \"Come in,\" I said softly and I saw the door starting to reveal my mother. She looked at me with this concern and curiosity in her eyes. \"Tara, can I just talk to you for a moment?\" My mother said sweetly and then started walking away from the door. I pressed a kiss to Gavin's forehead and pulled myself out slowly from under him. I wondered what was on her mind, but knowing her, she probably already talked to my father. He probably told her how I left him there with no way to get to the hotel. In all honesty, I still think he deserved it. Not even a full day he was here and he was already creating havoc on my life. He was already hurting the people I care about. He was already hurting the main person I care about. I closed the door behind me because I didn't think that Gavin deserved to hear the petty complaints from my father. This was a fight between my father and I. Gavin wasn't in this, as far as I was concerned. My father did that to just attack me. He vindictive. I walked down to the kitchen and I saw my mother standing at the island drinking tea. She looked at me with eyes that were analyzing me and I felt uncomfortable under her microscope. I walked to the island and sat down and was ready to hear it. But even though I knew I was going to get yelled at, I knew I had to defend myself. I was eighteen and I have control of my life now. My father doesn't even know me. \"Do you want to start off with telling me why you stranded your father at Gavin's show? I look at my phone and see your father has written endless paragraphs about you and how disrespectful you were to him. Are you trying to make me look like a bad parent, Tara? He's going on about how you need to be more respectful. What the hell happened?\" \"It's a long story, Mom...Gavin and I picked dad up from the airport and the ENTIRE ride there, he just bashed everything we would put on the radio. Then, at dinner, he started talking to Gavin At the beginning, I thought it was a good thing. Like, the conversation between them could lead in the positive direction. And you know how Gavin is going to college to study in education and music, right? Well, when he told dad about the education part of it, he started saying how it's hard being a teacher and how you get next to nothing. He criticized everything I love about Gavin. And that's not even the worst part, did he happen to mention how Gavin and his band were about to sign a deal, but then dad came in and started to destroy any chance for them? He's just awful! And right now, Gavin is upstairs and barely speaking to me. I haven't seen him this quiet since we did that play and he thought I bailed out on him! When he does say it's not my fault, I wonder if he truly means that or if he's trying not to make me feel bad. I feel at fault,\" My mother took in each word and the shock on her face started to grow. She was absolutely mortified. She was absolutely speechless. \"Tara…,\" she didn't know what to say and that seemed like the only thing she could make out. Her eyes were filled with sympathy and the next thing I knew was that her arms were around me tightly. I hugged her back and tried my best to hold in the tears in my eyes. Some started to flow down my cheek and the frustration that was inside of me was erupting. It was all erupting into tears that shed down my face. \"He...He didn't tell me that...I'm sorry,\" She said and started to stroke my hair. I kept taking deep breaths to control myself. I didn't want to cry like this, but part of me felt relieved when I did. I feel like the stress was exiting my body. I then pulled away from the hug, looked down and wiped away the last few of existing tears. \"Go upstairs...I'll deal with your father. He put you in a position he shouldn't have. Just be there for Gavin right now, okay? I think he's just upset about the situation. Considering how many times you've been there for each other, I don't think he can be mad at you. You've bonded with Gavin quicker than anyone I've ever seen you bond with. Even a bit more than you did with Audrey when you were younger. He wouldn't be upstairs with you right now if he didn't love you. It'll be okay. Just comfort him. As far as your father goes...I'll make sure he cuts it out. He just comes in here and thinks he can control you so aggressively and I don't like that. Rob and I know you know what you're doing with your life. And if you ever stumble, we will be there to help you get back up. It's just another thing to learn from, but considering the last year you had for yourself...I don't think there's anything you're not capable of doing. You've inspired so many people, Tara. You've changed so many lives. Even the one who's upstairs in your room right now,\" She then leaned in and kissed my forehead. I nodded in comprehension and thanked her. My voice was a whisper because I felt weak. All this stress rang through my bones still. I was shaken up. I then walked upstairs and saw that Gavin was sitting on the edge of the bed. He had this face of thought as his hands were placed on his kneecaps. I closed the door behind me and he looked up at me curiously once he heard the noise from the door. \"More drama?\" He stated with a smile of distance. I wanted to do more for him, but my utilities were low. \"Let's get some sleep, okay?\" I said and walked over to him. He then nodded and fell back on the bed. I crawled in next to him and placed a kiss on his cheek. The space between us was more real. I turned off the light next to me and he moved closer under the darkness of the room. He rubbed my side and I knew by his touch the same guy was there. He pulled me into his chest. \"I love you, Tara,\" he stated softly. When he did without any pressure, I knew it'll get better between us. It has to.[Chapter 6] Radio Rebel The Changing Summer Weather Chapter 6: Talks I do not own \"Radio Rebel\" or any of the characters. There was this breeze that touched every part of me. I could feel it push back a few wisps of my heart and the relaxing coldness of the summer air go through my body. I had my headphones in and I was listening to some new artists that I was going to throw by Rob later on. He usually trusted my decisions when it came to my musc. He knew I always looked for something different that not only people could jam to in their car, but something with this deeper meaning. Something that each individual person can relate to deep within their soul. Whether it extend from something they relate to, to something that inspires them. Everyone has a different story and that's how music connects us. We all go through different things, but music is the story to our lives for a reason. Sharing those stories brings us closer. I heard the kids in the park laughing crazily. There was something about it that struck out to me. It reminded me of an easier time. When you're younger, parents are your heros. Along the way, that gets shaded in. With my father, it was definitely like that. Ever since that day at the show things have just been a blur. Things all have been jammed into one giant event and it made my brain hurt. I was in the park waiting for Gavin. We were supposed to come here and get some ice cream later on. He had been the same since that night after the show. He had been more quiet around me and he didn't know how to express his feelings. I then felt a hand on my shoulder and I knew who it was in an instant. I turned around, saw him and kissed his lips quickly for a moment. I felt his hesitance against my lips. I felt his touch become firm and unrelaxed. I looked up at him with furrowed eyebrows. He then sat down next to me and there was no smile on his face. There was a straight line carved into his lips. My body started to become uncomfortable. This wasn't him...This wasn't him. \"Tara, I need to talk to you about something,\" Gavin began as his eyes were focused on me. He didn't give me one glance. My heart started beating uncontrollably in my chest. It wasn't the good kind, either. This was the familiar feeling of panic that rushed through me like a storm. It was the same kind of panic I experienced ever since I was younger. It was the panic that made my feelings rip apart. \"O...Okay,\" I choked the words out. Every part of my worries was in that stammer. You could hear it so clearly as I barely got it out. Acceptance of it all felt like glue in my mouth. It all as caught up into a ball. My hands started to tremble and one of my legs started to bounce in this worry. I didn't want to look at him, but my eyes were stuck. I was focused on every word that was about to come out of his soft lips. Every word that was going to be poison that would cause my heart to feel this numbness within me. \"It kills me to do this, but...I don't think we can do this anymore,\" Those were the words I dreaded hearing. Those were the words that shook me. It felt like everything I knew was gone. He was the person I felt the closest to and here we were...Here we were. I could feel the tears in my eyes welling up. \"But...Why? Is this because of my dad and what he did with the band? Gavin, please don't do this...You know I love you so much,\" I cried begging. I had to have him stay. I don't know what I would be without him. He made me, well, me. He brought out the true traits in me. He brought out the part of me that I didn't want to lose. When we were together, life was magical. Right now, all I knew was that there was this pain. This growing pain in me. My mouth was open not knowing how to take on the situation. He looked at me and there was no words to be said. I knew this was it. All the parts of us that were collected together were now ripped apart before my eyes. We were no longer us. We were now two separate entities and stopping it felt impossible. He was making everything we built crumble. Everything that we created was turning into dust and smoke that filled the air and suffocated me. \"I loved you, too...but being with you has too many complications. I can't take it,\" the next thing I knew was that he stood up. Everything went black in my life. All I could see was that color. I woke up suddenly. I could feel sweat beading down my forehead and this ache was there. My dreaming was being influenced. It all felt too real. It felt as if I could taste the bitterness of the moment.I looked around and saw that it was morning. The clock next to me read 8:30AM and I took a deep breath. It was just a dream. It was all a dream. I then felt a comforting pull bring me into their body. I took in the scent and I knew it was Gavin. His cologne flowed through my nose and it reminded me of what truly was real. He was here. I wasn't going to let him escape me, either. This touch was what I needed. \"SLAM!\" I heard the door from downstairs shake the house. I jumped slightly at the unusual sound, but I figured it was probably on accident. The wind probably slammed it shut louder when mom went to the mailbox. I wiped away my worries and laid there in thought. I then heard my mother's voice escalate through the rooms of the house. It sounded like she was bickering with someone. I heard footsteps come and my mothers heels creating clatter against the staircase. She was in a heated argument and that's when I heard his voice. It was my fathers. The door then swung open and my father looked at me with widened eyes. I then felt Gavin's body levitate next to mine in shock as the door slammed against the wall. My heart began to race in my chest and I looked over at Gavin and his mouth was opened in confusion. \"You're letting her boyfriend stay the night?\" He growled in disgust and turned to my mother. \"I want him out. NOW. What kind of parenting do you have going on here? I know all about teenage boys! I was right when I had the feeling he didn't care about her. He just cares about getting her!\" My father exclaimed and I could feel my teeth grinding. Everything he was saying was untrue. He had no clue what Gavin and I's relationship was based on. He only had been around a day. \"Tara hasn't done anything she shouldn't have with Gavin under this roof. I've been taking care of her ever since you left us! Tara has become a responsible young adult and I couldn't be any prouder!\" My mom stated stepping in a bit. My father looked at her and began to open his mouth to fight back, but before he did, I had something on my mind. \"Gavin doesn't do that to me!\" I stood up immediately in my pajamas. I was now fully awake and aware.\"He just stayed the night because you made him lose such a big opportunity! You turned him into a different person with your little stunt! I've seen Gavin upset before, but you and your loud mouth made him worse! My boyfriend is the most talented person I've ever met. And yeah, we're young, but I'm always going to stand by him. You know why? Because our love is filled with layers. Don't talk about something you don't know,\" I said and then grabbed the door. \"Just stay out of my life!\" With that, I shut the door hard on his face then turned the lock. I looked over at Gavin and he was laying on my bed with his hands on his face in stress. I sighed heavily. I heard my fathers footsteps drift off, but my mother was still there. She knocked on my door. I knew she fought back, but it wasn't enough to make him stop. I just didn't know how to respond to the event that just unfolded. He always had to get his way and take advantage of certain situations that were on the table. \"Tara, I know you're probably angry because of all that...but just come downstairs when you're ready. I apologize for your fathers immature behavior. I trust you, honey,\" My mother stated and her heels clicked off into the distance. I couldn't even look at Gavin after that. I was too embarrassed. I sat on the edge of my bed, placed my head between my legs and started to cry. This situation made me feel weak. My father made me feel weak. Everything I've built when my father was gone was getting bulldozed. I then felt Gavin's hands on my back and his legs spread out around my body. He wrapped me up completely and attempted to comfort me. He then started humming a soft tune to make my nervousness cease. \"Relax, babe,\" I heard him whisper in my ear and kiss my shoulder gently. I then shook my head. I was so embarrassed. \"I'm so sorry you just had to witness that...I'm so sorry that you keep getting put in an uncomfortable and unfair position,\" I stated in shame. I couldn't even look at him. \"Just go talk to your dad...Go downstairs and hear him out. I'm fine, Tara. I love you and no one and nothing can change that. If you don't like what he has, don't fight back. Just walk away. Then after, I can take you out to breakfast before you go to work. It'll be fine,\" he stated in a hushed tone. He was taking the situation better than I was. He was being there for me. He was being strong for me. \"I hate him though, Gavin. I've actually began to hate his guts,\" I whispered and he kept kissing my back gently. \"No, you don't. You're mad at him...Just go try and work it out. That will make me happy. I always am happy when you are,\" Gavin stated and kissed my cheek. He had this way to soothe me down. \"Fine...But only because I want you to be happy,\" I stated and kissed his lips gently. He kissed me back and I could feel his care in the kiss. His smooth lips responding with mine. I knew I was so damn lucky to have him in that moment. He pulled away and looked at me with a shy smile on his face. \"Now go, love,\" he stated as he brushed my hair away from my face. I smiled at the gentle touch and did as he said. I walked down the staircase and I saw my mom in the kitchen. \"Where is he?\" \"On the steps outside. I told him to get out of the house. He refused to leave, though. He really wants to talk to you,\" she stated plainly. I sighed. The man was on his game when it came to persistence, but he was totally off when it came to women. \"Why couldn't I have had a normal father who wasn't a pain?\" I said with a slight laugh. My mom shook her head and shrugged. \"Doesn't matter how far away you two are, he still has those protective annoying instincts that all fathers have,\" I nodded in agreement and she laughed. \"How's Gavin doing?\" She stopped and looked at me with this hint of curiosity in her eyes. \"He's the reason I came down here. He's more concerned with me than himself...I got way too lucky with him. I'll be back. Probably soon because I don't think I'll be able to listen to his ignorance for long.\" With that, I opened the door and I saw my father on the staircase. He looked at me with surprised and this hope in his eyes. The door behind me closed and I sat down on the steps unwillingly. Here comes the talk I regretted before it began.

I am not making a profit from this story. P/L: It is the year 2054. A so-called \"Precrime division\" is working around Washington DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. But soon a Federal agent comes snooping around headquarters in search of flaws. Human flaws. And the main man on his list is John Anderton, a firm believer in the system, that is, before it came after him. With the help of one of his closest friends, Diana Warren, Anderton has to prove that he's innocent, even if it means that the system will be shut down. But there's a secret that's being hidden from them all, and it's right in front of him. Ch. 1: Murder Marks the Spot The images are shooting through my head, so short, incomplete. It's a nightmare, how can they call this a gift? I try to fight the previsions, my foresight, but I can't. Where I am, they won't let me. The fear that runs through my veins…the fear that's always existed there…will it stop? Can I end this gift? I'm tired of homicide murders. I want a break, I want to be free… I see a hand pick up a pair of scissors…the face of Abraham Lincoln. The scissors poke through the eyes. A newspaper boy rides by on a recumbent bike, a newspaper hits the ground. Snip, snip goes the scissors… But I can't leave until the mystery's solved. Until I can rest that my mother's murderer will be placed behind bars. No one knows the way I feel…they wouldn't believe me. Can I believe myself? Yes… There's a man's face watching—handsome, muscular. A kid's face is behind him. Left, right goes the kid's face. I see the back of the stranger and snip goes the scissors… Incomplete…that's how I am. Secrets swell within my head. I can't tell though…no…never tell. They'd never let me go…they'd keep me under surveillance always. Freak…that's what it feels like. An outcast. A woman admires herself in a mirror. Water runs into a bathtub. A hand reaches for a doorknob. I go through it, the door is left open. A flight of stairs…snip… The woman unbuttons her blouse as the strange man watches from a doorway. Up the stairs we head. The bedroom door's slightly ajar…snip, snip… But I will solve the mystery…I promise I will. I'll do whatever it takes. Maybe the pre-cops will see…they will see. But, the question is, can they? The woman smiles. Her and the stranger collapse together onto the bed. Another man's face rises over them now as he watches. The woman looks over her lover's shoulder, sees the face and sits up…the man by the bed is smaller than the lover, older, but enraged. He raises the scissors…snip, snip, snip… \" You know how blind I am without them,\" the smaller man said placing his glasses on his face. \" Howard don't cry.\" His wife told him sadly. The woman screams as the man stabs her in the throat with the scissors. Her chest moves rapidly as blood flows out and she struggles for breath. The muscular man tries to run for safety in the bathroom, but gets stabbed. Snip… Bloody scissors bounce open onto the bathroom floor. Blood-red water overflows onto the floor. The smaller man's wife lays dead on the bed, her eyes, lifeless unmoving. Soon, people will know the truth about my mother's death. They will see… Murderer… ---------------- Danny Witwer glanced curiously past the corner of one of the many halls as he explored the Precrime Headquarters. As an investigator for the Fed he was assigned to check and see exactly how Precrime worked, and if it was stable enough to go nation wide. His jaws moved up and down as he chewed a piece of gum. Walking through the clear glass halls he stopped and looked over to a door to his right, his hazel brown eyes scanning a sign that said \"Lounge\". As he peered through the glass walls he noticed a young woman sitting at one of the tables. Her back was to him but he could tell there was something wrong about her. Her slender legs were crossed at the ankles with all her muscles appearing tightly tensed. As she raised her coffee mug her hands trembled to where a few drops landed onto her hand and the table. \"Shoot,\" she muttered under her breath, rather weakly. Witwer frowned as he realized that her interjection was not because of the coffee but of something else. She took her unsteady right hand off the base of the mug and placed it on the wrist of her shaking left. She then began to breathe deeply. Quietly Witwer entered the room remaining behind her. Slowly, her tremor calmed and her arms and legs relaxed. \"Excuse me?\" Witwer softly said. The woman quickly turned around letting her long light brown hair swish around to her right shoulder; her eyes revealed a mixture of fear and shock. \"Are you alright?\" he continued. She grabbed a napkin and began to wipe the table and her hand. Her eyes avoided his, \"Yeah. It wasn't that hot.\" He motioned if it was ok to sit down and she nodded, \"No, I mean, you were shaking.\" She paused in the middle of one swipe across the table. \"You saw me?\" \"Yes.\" Her eyes shifted to the ground and gave a small shrug, \"Life hasn't always gone the way I wanted it to and let's just say I got into some addictions, but I quit all that a long time ago. And…every now and then I face some payback for my dumb mistakes, that's all.\" Witwer nodded contemplating, \"How long ago was it that you stopped?\" \"Six years.\" He raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"It's hard to get rid of something like that.\"—she shrugged—\"That's why I've begun drinking coffee.\" She told him as she walked over to a trash can and threw away the napkin. For the first time in meeting each other she looked over into his eyes with her crystal blue giving a frown, \"Who are you? I don't believe I've seen you on the force before.\" Witwer stood up and extended his hand, \"Danny Witwer, I'm the investigator from Fed.\" She shook his hand, \"Diana Warren. Wow, the investigation's today?\" Witwer nodded. \"Gum?\" He then held out a stick of gum. She smiled taking some, \"Sure. Want some coffee?\" He returned the smile sitting back down, \"That would be great.\" Diana walked over to the pot of coffee and poured him some into a mug. \"What would you like? Sugar or cream?\" she asked him over her shoulder. \"Both, thank you,\" he replied. She then walked over to him with his cup in one hand and hers in the other. Handing it to him she slightly smiled, \"Coffee and gum. What a great combination this'll be.\" \"It's not that bad actually.\" Tonguing the gum into her cheek, Diana took a sip of her coffee. Witwer watched as this time she was able to actually bring it to her mouth. \"So, can you explain to me about the headquarters?\" She nodded. \"Right now since there's not a future murder us precops will take a break until we hear the alarm sound which means that we need to set out. Then we suit up and load into our ships called 'Dispensers'.\" \"Where's the murders predicted?\" \"Over at the Precrime Analytical Room. I can lead you to it if you want.\" \"Ok.\" They both rose up and Diana walked over to the sink and set her empty mug down. Turning around she led Witwer out into the glass halls and began to head towards the Analytical Room when her watch went off. \"Oh,\" she said checking the face seeing it say WAITING MESSAGE, \"Listen, I'm gonna have to head to my office so, the room is straight ahead and then you take a left up a slightly spiral ramp and then you'll be there. If you get lost, just ask one of the secretaries for help.\" He nodded and smiled as he watched her walk off. -------------- Standing outside the door to the Analytical Room Gordon Fletcher, a muscular man with army style blond hair, watched as the Fed investigator walked in his direction being led by one of the secretaries. Hurrying into the room he approached John Anderton, a man in his early forties that ran the Precrime Department, while in the middle of solving a prevision. \"Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.\" Fletcher told him. Without glancing away from the holo screen Anderton replied, \"You're kidding, that's today?\" \"I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house—\" Anderton's blue green eyes inspected a frozen image, \"All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.\"—He turned to the black man, Jad, at the computer behind him—\"Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded. See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations—\" \"But John—\" Fletcher began. \"Fletch, just get him some coffee and tell him some stories of how I save your butt every day.\" \"I've got coffee, thank you,\" a voice said. Anderton turned to see Witwer who seemed to study at everyone and everything. \"Danny Witwer,\" He said extending his hand for a shake, \"The 'Twink from the Fed'.\" Anderton began to reach over to shake Witwer's hand when the image moved with him and disappeared. \"Oops,\" Witwer said looking over at the holo screen, \"Gum?\" \"Sorry Danny,\" Anderton said beginning to scrub images again, \"looks like I'm gonna have to give you the full tour some other time.\" \"The Marks moved two weeks ago,\" Jad informed, \"Nobody knows where. Still searching for family and employer.\" Looking over Jad's computer Jeff Knott announced, \"Time horizon, 12 minutes.\" Witwer slightly smiled continuing his conversation with Anderton, \"Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office…\" Glancing out the clear doors Anderton noticed there stood half a dozen female Precrime office workers who all seemed to be staring at the new comer. And even better, they all were chewing gum. ----------------- After checking her message, Diana began to head to the Analytical Room. She smiled as she began to reach the twisting staircase. The funniest part about the message was that it was a notice saying that the Fed agent had arrived. You need to stay on your toes Fletcher , she thought and began to think about how she could scold him. But before she came up with something, she entered a crowd of women that stood right before the door. \"What's this?\" she muttered to herself. \"Clear the stairs!\" Diana ordered, it wouldn't be good for a precop to exit the Analytical Room and then trip from the crowd. The women slightly back away. She opened the glass door and entered to find Fletcher explaining the procedure of \"scrubbing the image\" to Witwer. Hearing her steps Anderton turned around for a small moment and then brought his attention back to the holo screen, \"Not you too.\" She furrowed her brows continuing to chew her gum and looked back at the secretaries. At her stare they all scattered, afraid that they'd be punished for not obeying her. But she then noticed how all of them had received the same gift that she had. She looked over at Witwer with a crooked smile, \"Seems you found the place perfectly fine.\" Witwer smiled back. \"The victims are pronounced here, the killers here,\" Fletcher explained to Witwer pointing out the slots that the Red Balls drop from, \"Beyond that and the date of the crime, all we have are the images that they produce.\" He pointed down towards the \"Temple\" at the Precogs. Witwer walked over and stared down at the three beings immersed in the milky water, not exactly human, but not gods either. One thing that was rather shocking was that the tank that they rested in was the shape of the Precrime Headquarters' badge. He smiled as he noticed it. The Precogs themselves were pale and their veins were slightly seeable. It seemed almost painful to watch as their bodies withered in agony and shook. Fletcher followed Witwer over and watched the Precogs as well. It seemed amazing that they could have this technology as the years have progressed. Fletcher looked back to see Diana watching the prevision play over and over. He got her attention and directed her over and began to introduce her to Witwer when he saw she was already chewing gum. \"I guess you two have already met,\" he said. \"Yeah, we have,\" she replied. \"Want some more gum anyway?\" Witwer asked, \"The flavor fades away pretty fast.\" \"I show a cop on horseback.\" Anderton told Jad. \"Somewhere near the capital?\" \"No, maglev system.\" \"The mall?\" \"Georgetown.\" Diana smiled as she took the piece from his hand, \"Thanks.\" He returned the smile popping another into his own mouth. As he and Fletcher turned around to watch the Precogs he glanced back at Diana for a short minute. \"She's cute,\" he muttered to Fletcher. Fletcher smiled and stared down at the precogs. \"Filtered,\" he explained, \"the Precogs can see outward up to four days with a sensory range of 200 miles.\" Witwer blew a bubble, not even bothering to take his eyes off the Precogs, \"So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.\" \"Not after the vote next week. Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.\" \" If the Amendment passes, mind you.\" Diana said looking over at Fletcher. Yet as she stood there next to the Temple, Witwer couldn't help but noticed she looked a little weak. She seemed to have trouble standing up, and leaned up against the wall letting out a sigh. And when he turned to the Precogs, he noticed their focus had changed, they were all staring at her with their mindless cold blue eyes. She painfully glanced at the oracles and then leaned her head back against the glass again. \"What do you mean if ?\" Fletcher asked her, \"Who's not going to want an organization that stops crime before it happens?\" \"Someone who knows there's no system that's perfect.\" Fletcher and Witwer looked at her confusingly. What'd she know that they didn't? Absorbed in what he was doing, Anderton paid no attention to Diana's comment and continued studying the pictures. Looking at a map Jad turned to him, \"Two Howard Markses EYEdented in the sprawl. Neither show married—\" Anderton looked at the reference screens as they scrolled through Architectural Imagery. \"Oh this is good,\" Jad said excitedly, \"I show a match for Dwight Kingsley. Nineteenth century architect. He did two dozen houses in D.C…\" Knott checked his watch, \"Time horizon: 10 minutes.\" Jad turned around to Anderton and repeated louder, \"Time horizon: 10 minutes!\" An alarm went out in the headquarters, which made Witwer jump. Diana chuckled at him. Straightening his business jacket and trying to hide his embarrassment he asked, \"Can't they shut that off?\" \"That's the Red Ball alarm,\" Fletcher told him, \"Crime of passion. No premeditation. They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one. We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.\" As the alarm drilled in his head, Witwer looked over at him, \"People have gotten the message.\"—He then took out his pack of gum and offered it to Fletcher—\"Gum?\" \"Whoa,\" Anderton said looking at the image of the muscular man in the suit. He zoomed in on it. Behind him there was a child's face to the left of him. He turned to Jad, \"Look at the kid. In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.\" \"Yeah? So?\" Jad said not exactly what Anderton was trying to tell him. \"This one he's in the right.\" Anderton switched it to the next image where the child is to the right of the man but facing backwards. Moving the two images quickly to animate them it appears as the child is moving in a circle. \"It's a merry-go-round.\" He said, \"It's a park!\" ---------------- As Anderton's team ran down the halls Witwer began to follow with interest. \"There's only sixteen of those old merry-go-rounds left in the city,\" Diana told him, \"Two of which are in Georgetown. One in Barnaby Woods, the other in Woodley.\" \"Woodley's all Victorian,\" Anderton replied, \"It's gotta be Barnaby Woods. I want two cameras: one spyder, one floater.\" Pulling out a .45 from his waistband he jacked the clip and checked it. \"As I recall,\" Witwer began, seeing Anderton's gun, \"they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.\" Replacing the clip Anderton replied, \"They did. Make yourself comfortable. We'll be back in an hour.\" \"You mind if I tag along?\" Diana and Fletcher exchanged looks. They both knew that Anderton didn't even want Witwer to be here. \"I'd love to take you along, Inspector,\" He lied, \"but there's no room on the ship.\" ----------------- Loading on the ship Witwer watched as Anderton got in the seat next to Evanna, the team pilot. He glared at the Chief as everyone got into their seats. At the bottom of the Dispenser one empty seat stared mockingly back at him. Anderton had lied. \"Time horizon, six minutes,\" Evanna announced. And with that, the hover ship lifted off the ground and zoomed away. ----------------- In the hover ship Anderton checks his watch. COUNTING DOWN 5:38…5:37… ----------------- In the suburb of Barnaby Woods, the birds chirped a peaceful melody as the little boy played happily on the squeaky merry-go-round. As the spinning slowed down the boy jumped off and gave it another hard push and jumped back on as it went speeding in circles. Suddenly, the silence was broken by the sound of something overhead and as the kid looked around he finds that it's raining cops! Looking up he saw the Dispenser floating above him. He watched in amazement as the precops ran past him. This had been the first time he'd seen some in action! Anderton studied his portable screen showing the image of the boy with the house behind him. Memorizing what it looks like, he looked up. And to his dismay he found that there were houses surrounding the park, each one looking exactly alike. His watch gave a warning again: TIME HORIZON, ONE MINUTE. \"Chief,\" Evanna said, \"we're catching up to the future.\" \"Shut up, Evanna,\" He replied. Anderton began to study each house trying to figure out which one was most like the one in the picture. Diana walked up to him finding one distinct difference in one of the houses, \"Uh, Chief…\" ----------------- As Jad and Witwer waited in the Analytical Room he found there was a call on his screen. Rolling his chair over to his computer he heard Anderton's voice, \"Jad?\" He brought the image into view and answered, \"Go ahead.\" Witwer quickly moved right behind the black man staring fixedly at the screen. \"Did he close the door?\" \"What?\" \"Did Marks close the front door?!?\" Jad went through the images and found the one where Marks reenters his house, \"Negative—front door is open! The front door is open!!\" ---------------- Looking over at Diana, Anderton smiled throwing off his helmet reveling his army cut brown hair, \"Good work.\" Diana smiled, \"This case isn't quite over yet, Sir.\" And with that they ran into the house with the open door. Running up the stairs Anderton and Diana did their best to reach the bedroom in time. There was only a few seconds left… ----------------- Howard Marks stood over his bed and heartbroken, looked his wife, Sarah, in the eyes. Both her and her lover looked at him worriedly and shocked. \"I forgot my glasses.\" He told them. Sarah gave a gasp, \"Howard—\" He then grabbed his glasses off of the nightstand and put them on, \"You know how blind I am without them.\" Fear shot in Sarah's eyes as she saw the scissors in her husband's hand. \"Howard don't cry,\" she told him. And then, she felt the scream rising in her throat when she saw them being raised above his head and anger in his face. He began to bring the sharp weapon down and she knew he was going to kill her. But suddenly, the downward motion of the scissors was stopped—as Anderton grabbed Howard's hand. \"What—\" Howard said surprised. Anderton's watch beeped as the time ran out. They'd reached the future. Howard fearfully looked around and began to break free of Anderton's grip when he noticed a gun being pointed at his head. Looking up at the owner he found it was Diana. \"Hey there,\" she smiled. Suddenly, the rest of the team busted through the ceiling windows. Both Sarah and her lover went screaming as glass fell onto their bed and went into their hair. They began to run from the precops when two grabbed them. Anderton stared Howard in the eyes, \"Mr. Marks, you're under arrest for—\" But breaking free of his grasp Howard began to run for the stairs. \"Knott,\" Anderton called out. The officer obeyed and caught the future murderer and threw him on the bed. Pinning him down Anderton took a spyder from his belt and scanned Howard's retina. \"Positive for Howard Marks.\" Frozen, all Howard could do is gape. Looking out the window he saw the Dispenser. Why me? His mind screamed, why couldn't it be someone else? \"Mr. Marks, by mandate of the District of Columbia Precrime Division, I'm placing you under arrest for the future murder of Sarah Marks and Donald Doobin that was to take place today, April 22, at oh-eight hundred hours, four minutes—\" \"What?\" Sarah screamed as she was forced out of the room along with Donald. \"I didn't do anything!\" Howard pleaded, \"Sarah!\" Anderton looked over at Fletcher who had brought out something that looked rather like headphones. \"Give the man his hat,\" he said. The other officers began to shave Howard's head and he watched as his dark brown hair fell in clumps on the floor. He watched Fletcher near him in horror. \"Oh God! Don't put the halo on me!\" Fletcher continued forward like death, unflinching, expressionless. And then he raised it over the future murderer's head as the criminal screamed: \"I wasn't going to do it! I wasn't going to hurt her! I just wanted to scare her!\" Fletcher suddenly gave a small smirk looking at him with his cold blue eyes. He placed the halo onto the man's head and he soon went into a convulsive shock, his eyes rolling white into his head as he finally went limp. ----------------- Witwer watched as the Howard Marks murder repeated itself on the prevision screen. He didn't understand it. Didn't they make it in time? \"I thought,\" He said, \"they stopped the murder—\" Looking over at the young Fed agent Jad paused the image of Howard Marks stabbing his wife, \"That's just an echo.\"—He smiled—\"Precog déjà vu if you will. Some of the really bad ones, the Precogs see over and over again. Wally, erase the incoming.\" With a move of Wally's hand on his workstation the image disappeared and everything went blank. Looking over at the precogs in their tank Witwer watched as the female stopped her shaking and rolled over into the milk. ----------------- Walking into the bathroom Anderton turned off the bathtub water just before it flowed over. Diana looked over rather sadly at Sarah Marks as she reentered the bedroom screaming for her husband. Seeing him there on the floor, limp but not lifeless, she brought a hand up to her mouth and her eyes began to water. \"Oh no,\" She muttered to herself, \"Howard…\" The tears grew and she began to cry uncontrollably. Hugging herself she backed up to a wall and when she hit it, she slowly sunk down to the ground. \"It's all my fault,\" she wept, \"It's all my fault…Howard…\" Diana wished she could've given Sarah some comforting words, but it was true. It was her fault that Howard was going to be in jail. \"Diana,\" She heard the voice of Anderton call out to her. She turned and saw that everyone was packed and ready to go in the Dispenser except for her. Looking back at Sarah she said the most comforting thing that she could think of at the moment, \"I'm sorry Sarah.\" ------------------ Changing from her uniform to some more comfortable clothes Diana exited the suit up room. Well, another victory for Precrime , she thought. But something made her feet stop moving. Her mind flashed to Sarah's face, all blotchy and red from crying. Could they really call that a victory? Tearing away a family like that? Howard was right, he had committed no crime. So was it right to sentence him to the Department of Containment? If he were given the chance, would he have changed his mind? And then maybe they could've just given him a warning, and keep a close eye on him. But no, they have to go and arrest him. Maybe this whole Precrime mess wasn't as good as she thought it was. She tightly closed her eyes; her hand began to slightly quiver. She took a deep breath and dismissed a disturbing thought that had just entered her mind. Her body relaxed. And suddenly she felt a hand plop down on her shoulder. Out of shock and reflex she spun around and grabbing the wrist she twisted the arm in an uncomfortable position. The person she had a hold on winced slightly and gave a small smile, \"Hello Diana.\" Quickly letting go she backed away recognizing the voice, \"Oh! I'm sorry Danny! I didn't recognize you!\" Stretching his arm he winced again, \"I figured that much.\" \"Sorry, it's just that, you don't sneak around people like that.\" Running his hand through his dark hair Witwer replied shruggingly, \"Hey, that's my job.\" \"So, what're you doing here?\" \"I was wondering if you could show me around.\" She frowned, trying to see if there was a secret message between the lines, \"But, haven't you already seen everything?\" Witwer walked closer to her, \"Everything except for one of the most important rooms in this building.\" Diana slightly smiled, \"Oh no, no one is authorized to enter the Temple—\" \"I'm not talking about the Temple. I'm talking about the Department of Containment.\" ----------------- Walking down a ramp Witwer soon saw the door stating: the Department of Containment. There was the faint sound of an organ playing. The music was classical, it seemed soothing. He began to walk forward when his retinas were EYEdentiscanned and a mechanical voice said, \"Not cleared for access.\" Diana gently pushed him away and when she was scanned the doors opened and the voice announced, \"EYEdent: Diana Warren approved for entry.\" Looking back with a smirk she motioned for Witwer to follow. Pulling back a curtain they entered what looked like a living space consisting of a bed, a stove, and a fridge…and not to mention a huge pipe organ. The music seemed to reverberate off the walls giving it a professional sound but obviously the man playing it was making it up as he went. Diana walked over to the man in the wheel chair tapping him on the shoulder. The music stopped abruptly with him dropping both hands onto all the keys in reach. Witwer winced at the horrible sound. The man spun around, \"Hoo boy! You scared me, Diana.\" \"Sorry,\" she replied, \"you the sentry?\" The man nodded, \"Yes Mam. I'm Gideon.\"—He pointed to the organ—\"The music relaxes the prisoners.\" Starting up his electric wheelchair he began to roll over to the control area, \"I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?\" \"No, you're not in trouble. It's just the Inspector from the Fed is here and he wanted to see this.\" \"Oh,\" Gideon gave a rather grimy smile turning to Witwer, \"That explains why I don't recognize you. But, uh, didn't we schedule—\" Winking he introduced himself, \"It's ok. Danny Witwer. Gum?\" Gideon nodded and took a stick, \"Thanks.\" \"Can I see the prisoners?\" He asked. Gideon smiled, \"For that my friend, we go for a ride.\" The three of them moved onto a platform that stretched out from his apartment and after pressing some buttons all the prisoners began to rise up from the ground in their containment with the metal halos on their head. The platform spun around showing how the prisoners covered almost every inch of the giant area. Diana watched as the long glass tubes with the prevision of the murder in front of each criminal—well, future criminals—kept on rising, even higher than the platform. \"My God, there's so many.\" She said shocked. \"And to think,\" Gideon said, \"they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you.\" Passing one prisoner she saw the name John Doe. \"Hold on a minute.\" Witwer glanced over at her. She continued, \"Can I look at this guy?\" \"Ah, the old Anne Lively case,\" Gideon said with a rather pleasant tone, \"A golden oldie this one is. The first case of Precrime all together.\" Diana gave a slight sad chuckle, \"Well waddaya know.\" The small holo screen played the prevision over and over. She leaned forward and looked at the images with a tender smile. Frowning Witwer watched as she reached out her hand and touched the screen as the face of Anne Lively appeared. She turned to Gideon, \"Can you show us where she is now?\" He began typing on his computer and then sat back as the information popped up. \"Huh. How ironic…\" he said. \"What?\" He turned the screen where both Witwer and Diana could see. MISSING. \"Must be a glitch in a system,\" he muttered to himself. \"What was that?\" Witwer inquired. \"Nothing,\" Gideon smiled, he couldn't let the Inspector know that there was something wrong. Lamar would have his head if he ended the Precrime operation right before the voting, \"Anyways, it's late and you kids better get home.\" ----------------- Exiting the Department of Containment Diana began to walk off when she heard Witwer call her name. She turned around, \"Yes?\" \"Would you mind if I took you home?\" Witwer asked. She stood there for a moment, tossing the idea in her head. Looking into his eyes she noticed that the cockiness and arrogance that they usually showed had faded away into a softer, gentler look. Her face broke into a smile. \"Sure.\" ---------------- It was rather silent for a few minutes as Diana rode with Witwer in the maglev car. Then, Witwer looked over at her and asked, \"Why'd you show such concern when you saw that Anne Lively case?\" She slowly looked up from the ground, \"Well, a few years ago, my mother was murdered and, that's what got me to join Precrime. So, I guess it kinda hits me in the heart when I see another case like that.\" \"But, didn't the precops stop Anne from being murdered?\" Diana was silent for a moment, as if the question was too tough. \"Well…yeah. Just, seeing it reminds me about it.\" Taking out a necklace under his suit Diana recognized the cross as a rosary. Witwer began caressing it, \"I know how it feels, to lose a relative like that.\" She gave him an inquiring glance. \"My father was a preacher. He was shot and killed when I was fifteen on the steps of our church in Dublin. How'd your mother die?\" Diana was silent again, she looked away. Witwer looked at her concerned. Tenderly kissing his rosary he tucked it under his suit and reached over to her and placed his hand on hers. She slightly looked over, just enough to see his contact with her. The trail of a tear shined slightly on her cheek as the dim light caught onto it. Witwer tightened his hand where he was holding hers now, \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to hurt you.\" Sniffing Diana wiped her eyes with her free hand, \"It's ok. She left the house one day when I was about nineteen and…and never returned.\" There was silence in that moment, as Witwer held Diana's eyes in his. He then pulled a small packet out of his pocket. \"Gum?\" She chuckled taking a piece, \"Either you have a large pack of gum or you're constantly buying that stuff. You an addict or something?\" He smiled taking a piece for himself, \"No. It's just my way of getting to know people.\" Then realizing that they were still holding hands he quickly let go. \"Oh yeah,\" She said quietly looking away hiding her blushing face. They both smiled. ---------------- Pulling into the entrance to her house Diana began to unbuckle from her seat. \"So, is this where you live?\" She laughed at Witwer's rather stupid question. \"Yeah, and then John lives right next to me.\" He nodded thoughtfully. \"You two are pretty good friends aren't you?\" \"Yes, I joined the team about a year after him. We've been able to relate to each other real well. John's a nice guy. Take it easy on him, k?\" He shrugged, \"Sure.\" There was once again, silence. But in this silence Witwer heard the soft mutter of a child's voice from the room right next to hers, Anderton's room. \"What's that?\" He asked. \"Oh, a lot of times at night John will watch old home movies. He lost his son, you know.\" \"How'd it happen?\" He frowned, though behind that his wheels were turning, absorbing as much information as he could get. \"Kidnapped.\" He shook his head thoughtfully, then brought his focus back to Diana. \"Well, if my interrogation is through,\" She smiled breaking the silence. \"I'd like to head on in and get some sleep.\" \"Oh! Yeah,\" his thick eyebrows rose as he seemed to return from his thoughts and waved his hands motioning for her to go on, \"I'm sorry it's just…\"—Witwer stopped himself from finishing the sentence, pausing for a moment until he found an alternative answer—\"I'll see you tomorrow.\" Giving a puzzled smile she replied, \"You too.\" She began to walk into her house when she turned around, \"Oh and Danny, don't bother John this late if that's what you're thinking. He's been going through some rough times with the loss of his son and his wife divorcing him. There are some lines that shouldn't be crossed.\" As she said that, Witwer sensed that she didn't mean just John's private life should be left alone, but hers as well. There are some lines that shouldn't be crossed , the words repeated in his head. What's she got to hide? Smiling warmly at him she turned and entered her home. Witwer smiled also. And then, if he wasn't mistaken; when he began to place the maglev car in reverse he heard the muffled voice of Anderton's son from his apartment. It was tough to make out the words but it sounded like, \" Gotta keep runnin' .\"[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect.

She worriedly looked around as she began to exit her room and walk over to the nurse. Why hadn't Witwer shown up yet? She did tell him to drop by, right? \"Ready to go Miss Warren?\" The nurse broke through her thoughts. \"Of course,\" she smiled. \"Well, what I'm going to need you to do is take one of these pills right here right before you go to bed every day till the jar's empty. K?\" Diana nodded only paying the girl half her attention. \"These pills are going to evaporate the remaining milk in your lungs. Now I'm not gonna say it doesn't hurt because sometimes you may think your going to have your lungs ripped right out of you, but you'll have to bear it.\" \"I can take anything.\" She told the nurse confidently. Nodding the nurse smiled like she didn't believe her. Ignoring the young woman's silent remark, Diana snatched the bag and headed towards the Lounge. She looked through the glass walls to see what she expected: Danny Witwer. Quietly walking in from behind him she watched as he just sat there, staring into his mug. \"Danny?\" She asked shocked. He quickly jumped at the sound of her voice and turned around. She smiled, \"Not exactly the best seat in the room.\" He nodded. She sat down in front of him, \"What's wrong? Where were you?\" Witwer looked up at her, \"What are you talking about?\" \"Don't you remember me telling you to visit me around when I was about to leave?\" \"Oh…yeah,\" he looked down at his coffee again, \"I wasn't sure if Anderton would still be with you. Didn't want to ruin any plans.\" \"What? Are you talking about lunch?\" He didn't reply. \"Lunch was canceled. So I'm free for the day.\" He looked up, so she does admit it . Guess she's not one to keep secrets . He forced a smiled. \"So I was wondering,\" it was her turn to look down at the coffee table, \"are you still up for a bite to eat?\" His smile grew. This wasn't as bad as he thought it was going to be, \"Of course.\" She returned the smile and they both stood up. Witwer walked over to the sink and put up his cup as Diana waited for him. Then, standing side by side, he extended his elbow and she hooked her arm around it. ------------------ Walking out of Precrime Headquarters Diana looked up at giant sculptures of the Precogs. \"Seems to say more than what you think it does, doesn't it?\" she asked. Witwer looked over at her, \"What?\" \"The statues. There's something so captivating to me.\" \"Yeah, there is something about it.\" He agreed nodding. \"The one thing I don't like about it though,\" she said as they stopped to admire the towering sculpture, \"is that it has the Precogs rising from the milk, and that gives it more of an unreal touch. And I believe because of that some people are inspired to consider the Precogs as gods and goddesses.\" \"So you did actually know something of what I was saying back in the Temple.\" \"Oh yes, I understood you perfectly.\" He smiled and directed Diana over to his white Lexus. Opening the door and letting her get in he then got in himself. \"So, where do you want to go?\" She shrugged her shoulders, \"I dunno.\"—She thought about it for a moment and then an idea came to mind—\"How about we go to the park over in the old Washington?\" Witwer nodded. \"Sounds good.\" Pulling his car to a stop at a parking lot Witwer looked over at Diana. \"So, uh, what are we going to do about lunch?\" He asked her. Frowning she gave him a slight smile, \"You haven't been to many parks have you?\" \"Why?\" \"Well—\" She then pointed to a stand that was near a playground, \"They always have hotdogs.\" \"Of course!\" Witwer gestured towards the stand, \"I knew that! I was just testing you. Lucky for you, you passed.\" He shined a charismatic smile her way as he opened his car door. A smile she returned. Locking the car as they got out Witwer waited for the answer of a beep from the vehicle then moved on. Yet as they walked over to the stand Diana couldn't help but notice the many wandering eyes that fell upon her friend. There seemed to be suspicion and distrust in those stares, not to mention fear. She looked over at Witwer who seemed oblivious of it. But he was used to the way he was, little did he know that his daily dress looked like someone from the Men in Black. She stopped him, \"Hold on a sec.\" He looked at her, \"What?\" \"You look too fancy. This is just some casual out to lunch thing, you look like you're going to an opera.\" He chuckled. \"How do I need to look?\" Accepting his offer she replied, \"Like this.\" Unbuttoning his jacket she began to undo his tie. He watched the concentration on her face that soon brought a smile to his lips, it was not every day he had this kind of contact with a girl. She smiled slightly too as she undid a few buttons to his shirt. \"There,\" she said standing back admiring her work. \"How do I look?\" he asked raising his arms giving his torso a slight twist, \"Charming? Handsome?\" She laughed and walked back up to him. \"Not even close.\" She then brought out her arm and ran her fingers through his hair, \"Gosh, it's practically stiff. How much hair gel do you use?\" He smiled, \"Enough for it to last.\" Ruffling his hair she made it to where it relaxed and had some of his bangs in his eyes. \"Now you're ready,\" she smiled and handed him his tie. Stuffing it into his pocket they finally made their way to the stand. ---------------- Sitting on one of the park benches Diana bit into her hotdog. The ketchup squeezed through the back and dripped onto her fingers. She licked it off, \"What's the deal with you and Anderton? Seems like you guys are always at each others throats.\" Taking a bite Witwer didn't bother to wait to talk, \"I dunno. The guy just obviously hates me. I'm just doing my job, y'know.\" \"Yeah,\" she gave a small laugh, \"That's what Anderton said too.\" \"I've tried my best to get close to Anderton like you, and that only made him hate me more.\" She laughed, \"Yeah, he can be like that. He's never liked Feds anyway though. We came to Precrime at around the same time so you could say we've matured as cops together. And maybe that we live right next to each other helps.\" Witwer nodded then made a face, \"Why are we talking about Anderton? This is our time to get to know each other.\" She smiled. \"Feeling a little jealous?\" Witwer looked over at her, \"What? Me? Jealous? Come on, of course not.\" She chuckled, \"So, have you ever had a girlfriend before?\" Witwer looked at her, \"That was random.\" \"Well, I just got to wondering.\" He looked to the ground, \"No, not really.\" \"Really? Why not?\" \"I-I don't know. I guess it was just me too wrapped up in my job.\" She smiled at his shyness. Then looked out to the playground where some children were playing football. Faint shouts came from them in that distance as they called out plays pretending to be their own football hero. They would at least attempt at plays, considering all they knew was that you needed to get the football to the touchdown line and if someone of the opposite team had it, tackle them. She watched as one of the kids yelled, \"Go long!\" and reeled back for his throw. Finishing up her hotdog she watched as the ball left the boy's fingertips and went sailing through the air. She got her hands ready and watched as the boy that was suppose to catch it ran backwards yelling, \"I got it! I got it!\" It was then Witwer looked up to notice that the football was headed right at him. He gasped seeing there wasn't any time to do anything. When suddenly, Diana was before him, with the football in her hands. \"Good catch,\" he said. She looked back at him, \"Thank you.\" The little boy who used to be yelling, \"I got it!\" stopped in his tracks, shocked that she had the ball in her hands. He then meekly walked up to her. \"Um,\" he glanced down at the ground and crossed his arms behind his back, \"Sorry that the ball nearly hit you. Uh, can I have it back?\" Squatting down to the boy's height she told him, \"Of course. And next time tell your friend that it's best to do long throws when you've actually got a football field to run the length. I believe that would've been a touchdown if you had.\" The boy smiled, \"Ok!\" She smiled back watching him run back to his buddies. Getting up Witwer looked over at her, \"What about you? Have you ever had a boyfriend?\" She sighed standing up from her crouching position, \"Unfortunately, yes. But I did a lot of stupid things when I was younger.\" ---------------- Witwer looked around as they walked past the towering beautiful green trees of the park. He could hear the music of the birds come into his ears and there was no hustle or rush that you often face in the city. \"Y'know?\" he said to Diana, \"I truly think you made a good choice.\" She smiled, \"Yeah. I've always liked this side of Washington better than the other.\" \"Really? Even though there's not as much technology?\" \" Especially because there's no technology. I mean, look around you. Technology has destroyed some of Earth's most beautiful things. There's so much security here. And trust. The more years we've advanced into the less privacy we've gotten. Have you ever realized that?\" \"Oh yeah.\" \"But things like this park, it frees your mind of those problems. You relax.\" He smiled looking at her. The spring sun heated their backs and it seemed to illuminate her face; like an angel. She smiled back at him. Slyly he slipped his hand into hers and she looked over at him. She removed her hand from his grasp and then moved closer to him as they walked. Taking the hint Witwer draped his arm around her shoulders. \"So, what were you doing before you came to Washington?\" she asked. \"Well, I was in New Jersey busy searching for an illegal alien drug dealer. He was importing packs of clarity to all surrounding states and some even here.\" \"Wow,\" she looked down at the ground, \"What'd he look like?\" \"From what I'd heard he had long hair and…no eyes.\" \"No eyes?\" she looked away worried. \"Yeah, he was going to get them swapped out but he didn't have enough money to afford it so he just was left blind.\" \"Ew. Did you catch him?\" Witwer sighed, \"No. He disappeared and we lost tracking of him. And that's when I was reassigned to here.\" \"Well,\" she replied, \"I'm glad we got you to check things out. You're different from the usual Feds I've seen.\" \"Really? How?\" \"For one thing, you're not dressed like some tough guy. And another, you're a whole lot nicer. I've been interrogated by some of the roughest guys out there.\" \"Is there not a third reason?\" She smiled. \"Well,\" he said looking up thoughtfully at the baby blue sky, \"I believe we've talked enough about me. How's your life been before I came?\" \"You don't want to hear about my life. It's too boring.\" \"I bet it's not.\" \"The time I actually started doing something meaningful in my life was when I joined Precrime. Anything before that had to do with creating some type of mischief.\" \"Well, I'm glad that we got to meet now instead of back then.\" \"Thank God. I was a totally different person back then.\" He laughed. \"No, really. I'd probably be one of the people you'd be looking for. And if we'd met back then, we probably wouldn't be this close.\" He smiled, \"What do you mean by that?\" She laughed realizing what she said, \"I mean, friends. Did you bring an umbrella?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"Why?\" \"'Cause it's about to rain.\" He looked up into the sky to find that the light blue had been replaced with grey. And as in response to her comment about it raining thunder sounded. He smiled looking at her. She looked into his brown eyes, and frowned trying to see why he was so happy. Then a raindrop fell onto her head. They both looked up to feel another drop on their face. And then another. Slowly Diana could feel her clothes begin to get wet. She looked over at Witwer, \"Do you think we should go now?\" He smiled, \"Nah. It's just water.\" Pulling apart they linked hands and continued down the path. At this point, they were soaked with their clothes clinging to them and their hair flat on their heads. Diana smiled as she looked over at him to find Witwer shaking his head like a dog with his dark hair flying everywhere. \"So much for gel,\" she said. He laughed, \"Tell me about it.\" Reaching the center of the park they found a giant beautifully decorated fountain. \"Hey look!\" Diana let go of her grasp on his and ran over to it. She peered over into the pool and looked at the pennies on the bottom. He walked over to her and leaned over also. \"Look at the ripples,\" she said with a smile, \"Y'know? Water ripples can be like life, every action (or ripple) you do effects everyone else's life whether you mean to or not.\" He nodded and smiled, \"What about these ripples?\" And with that he struck his hand into the water and splashed her. Jumping back with shock she glared at him, \"Those mean that one action is the cause to another.\" And with that she placed both hands into the water and got Witwer even more wet. \"Is this a payback?\" he asked her with a smile, \"We're already wet.\" She smiled back and reeled back to give a play punch when he grabbed her arms and held both of them behind her back. He then pinned her against one of the trees. \"Never mess with a Federal agent,\" he smiled. She returned the smile and an awkward silence came across again. They just stared into each other's eyes, holding them. Witwer brought his face a little closer and she asked him, \"Can I ask you a question, Danny?\" Without taking his eyes off her he gave a slight nod. \"Have you ever really, really ever kissed a girl?\" He smiled, \"No. You're the first.\" He continued to bring his face closer and their lips soon found contact. It was bliss as Diana kissed him with her eyes closed. The rain didn't matter to her anymore, nothing did. Time seemed to stand still for the moment. Pulling apart she found herself breathless. He smiled warmly at her. \"You know? For that to be your first kiss, you are wonderful at it,\" she told him as she pulled one of her hands out of his grasp and ran her fingers through his hair again. And then, she pulled his face towards hers again and this time, they kissed longer. --------------- Pulling into her house once again, Diana looked over at him, \"Thanks for—uh—would you call that a date?\" Witwer smiled, \"I'd like to.\" She returned the smile, \"Yeah, thanks for the date. It was…absolutely wonderful.\" \"Yes it was.\" She sighed looking into those beautiful brown eyes. \"Well, I guess this is good-bye. I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Yeah.\" Getting up from her seat Diana walked over to him and gave him one last kiss. \"Maybe there'll be a murder tomorrow and you can come and see how we do it.\" \"That is, if Anderton will let me.\" \"Oh, I can make him.\" Witwer smiled, and with that Diana entered her home again. He couldn't help but wish that she could invite him in just once, but he guessed considering their jobs it might not be a good idea. He looked over to Anderton's apartment. No lights were on, nothing. It looked empty. Should he go take a look? It was part of his job to do that anyway. There are some lines you shouldn't cross , Diana's voice warned him in his mind. He tossed and turned the idea in his mind, when he thought of something. If Anderton is really a good cop then he should have nothing to hide. He backed the car up and moved over to Anderton's door. --------------- After changing into some dry clothes and wrapping a towel around her head Diana walked over to her couch and sat down. Grabbing the phone she dialed Anderton's house. As she waited for someone to pick up she smiled reminiscing on past events. But there was a problem with that, no one picked up. She hung up the phone and dialed Anderton's car phone. His image appeared on the screen, \"Hello?\" She smiled, \"Hey John! Where are you?\" \"I'm headed home. I wanted to talk to Lamar about the Anne Lively murder.\" \"Ah. Listen John; once you get home, I want you to hide all of your clarity. Danny just got through working on a drug dealer, and I believe it's Lycon that he was looking for.\" \"I'm fine, Diana. Did you tell him about Lycon?\" \"No. I knew how important he was to you. But John, what if Danny decided to look at your house right now? What would you do?\" \"I'm fine , Diana. Geez, what is it with you guys today? Lamar was fretting over the same thing.\" \"You're a great cop, John. And I don't want to lose you. In fact, if we did, I'm not sure if I could work along with any other man.\" \"Thanks but, I've got things under control.\" \"John—\" \"It's ok, don't worry.\" \"Alright, fine. See you tomorrow.\" \"Bye.\" Diana hung up her phone and sadly put it up. She couldn't help but worry. Danny was no dummy. If he's intent on finding something he will. And when he does, John's going to be in big trouble. --------------- Searching around Anderton's apartment Witwer noticed his kitchen table covered in papers and trash. He walked over to it and inspected it. And then he found what he was looking for and picked it up. A container of clarity. That's what he was hiding. That was the flaw. He stuck the drug in his coat pocket and walked over to Anderton's computer. Pressing some buttons he watched as the TV was turned on and projectors all around the room came on. It was a video of Anderton's little boy, Sean. He was a cute kid, and in the film he was talking about how he and his friends had created a club. \"Daddy's in big trouble, Sean,\" he said.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect.

There's a face wearing sunglasses…The number nine and then the number six…the inside of a small apartment…a figure backlit by a window…a cracked mirror…a small man…a pair of dark eyes… -------------- Anderton walked into headquarters the next day and stopping by the coat rack he hung up his jacket. And as he did, his image card with the information of Anne Lively's drowning fell out. He bent down and picked it up and once he did, studied the scene. What was so important about this murder? What did he need to see? His ears picked up the sound of laughter and as he looked up he noticed that the secretaries were having a baby shower for the lady who was pregnant. Looking into the crowd he noticed Fletcher, Diana, and most of his team down there. And then he saw Witwer. His hand on the pregnant secretary's stomach cracking a joke. Anderton next heard a roar of laughter following it. Well , he thought to himself, if it isn't Mr. Popularity over there . Looking in his direction his team saw him and began to leave when Anderton motioned for them to stay. Witwer looked up and watched them curiously. Anderton pocketed the data card and went into the Analytical Room. ------------ Diana walked over to Witwer who was just making his way over to the food. \"Looks like I was right in you getting to see us in action,\" she told him nodding her head towards the Analytical Room. Turning around with a piece of cake Witwer looked up to see Anderton \"scrubbing for images\". He looked over at her, \"Do you think Anderton will accompany us on this one?\" She chuckled at him, \"Of course he's going to be with us. What makes you say that?\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"Some of my agent friends are suppose to come down today and I'm supposed to talk to them about how Precrime is going so far.\" \"You mean you're leaving today?\" she looked at him sadly. \"Not today, I haven't finished my investigations yet.\" She smiled, \"Good. After yesterday I believe you don't need to rush off.\" He returned the smile. Suddenly, Diana's smile disappeared. She tightly closed her eyes and seemed to show a look of pain. Witwer watched her worried, \"Diana, are you ok?\" She remained silent, tightly holding her left arm which was back to shaking. And slowly, the shaking faded. She opened her eyes shocked, afraid. \"What's wrong?\" Witwer asked her putting down his piece of cake and grabbing her arms. She wouldn't look into his face for a moment; there was pain in her mind. He searched her face for an answer, but found none. Diana looked up towards Anderton, her eyes weakly watching him. Witwer looked over at her, and then up to Anderton. Laughter broke out in the crowd again. Anderton looked back into their direction with beads of sweat on his forehead. His face looked worried. And then, his and Witwer's eyes locked. And just as quickly Anderton looked back to the prevision screen. He watched as Jad left the Analytical Room and walked over to the baby shower. He then spoke to Fletcher. Witwer looked back up in Anderton's direction. He was alone now. What was he doing? ---------------- Anderton looked at the screen in disbelief. Is this a joke? He replayed the vision, absorbing every detail. The man in the sunglasses, the number six and nine, a cracked mirror, him shooting a man… Yes, he was supposed to murder someone. It can't be possible. He zoomed back on his face paused on the screen. He looks so desperate, so angry. What could lead him to murder? He stared at the face, the one with the look of desperation, and felt like he was looking at a stranger. In the Temple, Wally began to sit down at his desk and started to watch the prevision. \"You're not gonna kill me,\" one of the male precogs said voicing out the scene. Agatha replied, \"Good-bye, Crow.\" The male then said, \"Anderton wait!\" Wally chuckled as he saw Anderton's face appear on the screen as he shot a man out of a window with his .45. Surly this is a joke. He checked his headset, \"Jad are you getting this?\" There was no reply, \"Jad?\" Anderton quickly turned off the screens consisting of the witnesses, James and Pollard. He then heard Wally's voice, \"Chief?\" He looked over at the computer geek in the Temple, too stunned to answer. \"I like you, Chief.\" He said, \"You've always been nice to me. I'll give you two minutes before I hit the siren.\" Anderton looked at him for a moment, then quickly left the Analytical Room. He was dazed as he walked towards the elevator. Passing the baby shower he didn't dare look over at Witwer. That's the last thing he needed. Voices screamed in his head and all the excitement was overwhelming. He saw Fletcher waving him over but ignored him. And just when he nearly reached the elevator he bumped into Diana. \"Chief!\" she looked at him pleading, \"Listen to me, I'm on you're side. Don't go searching for him; stay away till the time runs up. I'm going to go and see if I can stall everyone. Run, John, run as fast as you can.\" Nodding Anderton took her advice and hurried to the elevator. Diana looked over to see Witwer walk up to her, \"What's going on?\" She looked at him, \"Nothing, John just has somewhere he needs to be.\" Witwer looked at her unconvinced. He pushed past her. Anderton pushed a button in the elevator that would bring him to the lobby. \"Hold that, please!\" he heard a voice say. His heart jumped into his throat as he recognized the voice and quickly pressed the close button. He impatiently kept on pressing the close button, but the doors were so slow. Two hands pushed in as the door nearly shut, and because of them being blocked they opened again revealing Danny Witwer. \"Thanks,\" he said. The doors closed and they began to move downward, \"You're in a lot of trouble, John.\" Anderton stepped back and got his hand ready for his .45, \"You set me up…\" \"I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.\" Anderton looked at him shocked. Diana and Lamar were right; he shouldn't have been so laid back. Witwer began to reach into his coat when Anderton quickly grabbed him and shoved him against the wall. He drew his pistol and jammed it right under Witwer's chin. The Fed agent kept his eyes locked on Anderton and let a small smile escape from his lips. He slowly pulled out a black inhaler, \"It seems I've found a flaw, John. You.\" \"You gonna tell on me?\" \"Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.\" Anderton remained silent. \"I guess we won't be working together after all.\" Witwer told him. There was a ding as the elevator reached the bottom. The doors begin to open. \"Now put the gun down, John. I don't hear a Red Ball.\" Witwer told him with a smirk. But just as he said that, the Precrime siren went off. Witwer's sure face changed and his eyes were replaced with fear. Anderton smiled. Witwer's mind raced with horrible thoughts, and knew this was the end. Anderton was going to kill him. But instead, he lowered his gun and pushed Witwer against the wall one last time and turned and ran. Letting the elevator doors close on a stunned agent. -------------- Diana found herself biting her nails as Lamar ordered her and Fletcher into his office. It was a rare habit for her to do, but on this occasion it seemed practically natural. John would not kill someone, but how could he be framed? How could a person make something like that happen? And who would hate him enough to do it? \"Don't worry,\" Fletcher told him, \"We'll bring him in unharmed.\" \"Yeah,\" Diana agreed, \"I'm going to find out who's behind this.\" They heard a voice behind them, \"Actually Gordon, Diana, you're not going to do that.\"—The man turned to Lamar—\"I'm taking control of the team.\" It was Witwer. Of course , she thought. \"You're what?\" Fletcher replied shocked, he and Diana exchanged looks. Lamar motioned to them that it's ok. \"Witwer,\" he told him, \"Fletcher is second in command. And Diana is one of my most trustful precops. It's their show to run. You want, you can observe.\"—He looked over at them—\"Do it. Find him.\" Fletcher shot a look at Witwer, then looked over at Diana. She nodded and they began to leave together when Witwer called after her. \"Wait,\" he told her as she turned around, \"You're a part of this too.\" He watched as she moved back over to Lamar's desk and as he stared she returned the look with a glare. He was eerily calm. Something about that wasn't right. \"He came to see both of you yesterday,\" He said to Lamar then to Diana, \"Right before he got tagged. What did you guys talk about?\" \"The Mets,\" came Lamar's reply, \"John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.\" Diana looked over at Lamar and smiled in her eyes, \"Ah, really? I guess the game must've not been that good. He cancelled our lunch because of it.\" \"Bad call,\" Lamar replied. \"Why are you two protecting him?\" Witwer glanced from one to the other, \"You knew he was doping yet you did nothing about it.\" \"Danny,\" Diana's voice was firm, \"The man lost a child for Christ's sake! You lose a child and see how long you go without doping.\" \"Six years ago. What did you guys talk about yesterday afternoon?\" \"None of your business.\" Lamar replied. Diana sighed and looked away. Lamar gave in. He should've given the same reply. She began to walk out of the room. Witwer looked over at her and motioned for her to stay, but she ignored him. He placed his hands on Lamar's desk and looked at him agitated, \"It's all of my business now, Lamar. Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction…so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy. He's my suspect.\" \"He's my subordinate!\" Witwer could see the hate in Lamar's eyes. He'd just dropped from most popular guy on campus to the lowlife. Everyone hated him. Even Diana. And that hurt, \"Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.\" Lamar looked at him straight in the eye, \"I don't want John Anderton hurt.\" Witwer stared back at Lamar for a moment, then turned and grabbed his coat, \"I'm gonna enjoy working here.\" ---------------- \"Diana!\" She could hear the voice yelling at her, but she didn't bother to turn around. She knew who it was. Anderton was right, Witwer couldn't be trusted. Why was she so stupid to fall for that cute act? \"Diana!\" He called out to her again. She quickened her pace. The anger boiled in her and all she could think about was why? Then she felt his hand on her wrist and she stopped, turning to face him. She glared at Witwer. \"Take your hand off of me,\" she hissed snatching her arm out of his grasp. \"Diana,\" he said rather breathless, \"what's the matter with you? You've been acting cold to me ever since Anderton was predicted to be a murderer.\" She stared into his eyes unflinching. \"Why don't you figure it out,\" she replied. Oh how she wished he would go away, his very presence filled her with pain and anger. Looking back she couldn't believe that she had wanted him to stay in Washington longer. \"That's the problem,\" he quickened his pace also as she began to walk, \"I can't. Just yesterday I though we had something, and now you act like we've never met.\" She turned around and looked at him, \"We never have. The Danny I met was loyal, charming, and trusting. Now I see the true Danny, a liar. Well, for one thing, I don't let my love life affect my work. When we walk into Precrime Headquarters, you're just the Fed investigator that came to see if we could make Precrime nation wide.\" And with that, she walked off to Headquarters not even bothering to look back; though if she had she would have seen Witwer who stood frozen with his face shocked and hurt; his heart broken. ---------------- Danny Witwer stood in front of Anderton's team with the image of Leo Crow being shot behind him. \"You may consider him a friend,\" he said walking down the line of precops, staring into each one's eyes, \"But we know that John Anderton is going to kill Leo Crow this Friday at three-o-six PM, unless we stop him.\" He stared deeply into Diana's eyes, but she showed nothing in return. Everyone was glaring at him, why? What was so important about Anderton? Wasn't he good enough for them, for her? \"Don't think for a minute that if the situation was reversed he wouldn't go after you. He would be a cop doing his job,\" Witwer glared at Diana, her angry words echoing in his head, \"As I'm doing mine.\" Diana's glare followed him then glanced over at Evanna who stood next to her. Witwer stopped at the two women who were at the end of the line; \"So if you're not ready and willing to put the halo on him, leave now.\" There was silence. The precops exchanged looks. Nobody stood up. Looking at Evanna Witwer smiled, and hoping he could get Diana jealous, offered her a piece of gum. \"No thank you,\" she replied with a straight face. There was silence again, and Diana looked at her fellow precops with a questioning glance. And when she looked over at Fletcher, he cowardly lowered his head. She gave a sigh of frustration and threw down her Precop helmet. \"I can't take it anymore!\" she exclaimed and walked out in front of her teammates, \"Are you going to listen to this agent? He's only been here three days! Do you expect him to actually know what John would do? I've known him since he first joined Precrime, and if he were in my shoes right now, and I in his, he would make sure that I was safe.\" No one spoke, all the precops glanced shamefully down at the ground. Even Witwer felt bad. \"And I have to say,\" She continued, \"that it makes me sick that you're going to listen to him.\" She pointed at Witwer. He looked up surprised that she would accuse him like this. \"Really, I thought I wouldn't have to be the one to stand up for Anderton,\" she glared over at Fletcher, \"considering how some people know him even better than I do. But since no one will, I had to say something.\" There was still silence as she spoke. No one protested, no one agreed. What's with them? Are they scared of Danny? She though as she stared across the room at the precops. \"I'm leaving,\" she finished and quickly walked out the door. Witwer looked at her shocked and tried to stop her but she went back into that mood where she wouldn't speak to him. He then motioned for the rest of the cops to wait, and he ran out of the room. Running down to her he noticed that she had nearly reached the elevator when he stopped her. \"Diana!\" he called out, \"Wait!\" She turned around sharply and looked at him. \"Gee, isn't this familiar?\" He said recalling when she spoke to him before they went into Headquarters. She glared at him, \"Anderton was right about you.\" Witwer looked at her confused. \"He figured you out exactly, and—\"—She painfully looked away for a moment—\"and I was stupid enough to believe it wasn't true.\" Witwer looked at her sadly, \"Tell me, please.\" She looked up and controlling her emotions looked him in the eye. \"He said that you were just pretending to be friendly, because trust can get you anything. And he was right. Because you pulled it off excellently.\" It hurt Witwer to hear these words, just as much as it hurt to have everyone hate him, even worse. \"Diana, do you think I would use you like that?\"—He sighed; it was tough to say what he was about to say—\"Look, I have to admit maybe that was my first plans. But then I met you, and something happened I didn't expect to happen. I realized it when you fell into the precogs' tank.\" She looked at him, the anger receding in her for the moment. \"And what I was going to tell you in the medical room was: I'm in love with you.\" She looked at him shocked. \"I was in love with you once,\" she replied, and for once, it killed her to say that to him. Witwer looked at her sadly, his heart ached. He gave a deep sigh, \"I-I understand. I always knew you were in love with Anderton, I guess. Maybe I was the stupid one to think I'd have a chance with you. But that's fine. I'm not gonna stop you.\" Witwer noticed that Diana's emotions began to escape, even though she was fighting them. \"I am not in love with John!\" she exclaimed, \"We're just good friends! It's just I can't hunt him!\" \"I though you said you don't let your life away from work effect you.\" She looked at him sadly. It was true, \"Danny, I'm sorry. But I can't stand it anymore. It's mine and Fletcher's job to take control of the team if anything happens to John. And you've taken it away. It's not supposed to go like that. Frankly, I told John that I would not work under anyone else but him, and that's the truth.\" Witwer remained silent; he wasn't sure if he could put what he had in his mind into words. Diana stared at him quietly for a moment, holding him one last time in her mind. She then angrily tore off her badge and threw it to the ground. The sound brought everyone's attention to them. \"Here's a little reminder of me,\" she told him quietly, her voice quivering. And with that, she quickly walked into the elevator and punched the lobby button. She then collapsed against the wall and watched Witwer until the doors closed. His face was filled with so much pain, he looked so sad. She couldn't bare it. And she knew why. She had lied when she said she wasn't in love with him. Gosh, he was all she ever thought about. She was madly in love with him. And then the doors closed, and Witwer disappeared. With her back pressed against the wall Diana sunk to the ground, her body crumbling. And she cried her eyes out.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect. I am not making a profit from this story. I will say that I own the character Diana Warren, and that no one else can use her unless it's with my permission. P/L: It is the year 2054. A so-called \"pre-crime division\" is working around Washington DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. But soon a Federal agent comes snooping around headquarters in search of flaws. Human flaws. And the main man on his list is John Anderton, a firm believer in the system, that is, before it came after him. With the help of one of his closest friends, Diana Warren, Anderton has to prove that he's innocent, even if it means that the system will be shut down. But there's a secret that's being hidden from them all, and it's right in front of them. Ch. 5: Three's a Crowd Diana quickly rubbed her tears away with her sleeve as she got into one of the maglev cars. With bloodshot eyes she opened up a holo screen and typed Anderton's cell phone number into it. The screen grew snowy for a moment as she waited for Anderton to answer. She stared pleadingly as the screen remained blank for over a minute. Come on, John , she begged, answer me! I'm no traitor! And amazingly, just as if Anderton could've read her thoughts, he picked up at the last minute. \"John,\" She gave a weak smile. He looked at her through the holo screen mistrusting. His eyes burned into hers, \"Don't even try to think that I'm gonna believe what you're gonna say. Witwer's in the car isn't he?\" Diana looked at him sadly, \"No. Me and Witwer are finished.\" \"I don't believe you.\" \"John! How can you not trust me? Do you not remember my advice back at headquarters?\" He was silent, his piercing glare softened. She gave a sad chuckle and her eyes slightly watered, \"I mean, John. Look at me! Is there a badge on my uniform? I quit.\" \"You what?\" \"I quit. Everybody's turned against you, even Fletcher, but I couldn't do it. We've gone through too much.\" \"Diana…you loved your job…\" \"Not as much as I love my friends.\" She gave a slight smile. Anderton slightly smiled in return, then noticed her bloodshot eyes, \"What's wrong?\" She looked down, \"Nothing. I want to help you. I want to find who's behind this. You and I both know that you wouldn't be stupid enough to kill someone when Precrime's around.\" Anderton nodded, frowning slightly at how she had avoided telling him the truth, and looked around. He then turned his face back to her, \"Come to the Lexus Car Factory. I'll be waiting for you at the front gates.\" \"Alright, I'll get there as fast as I can. And John…be careful. Fletcher and them ought to have set out for you by now, and I'd watch your back.\" Anderton smiled, \"No problem.\" And with that, Diana hung up. -------------- Anderton began to walk down the stairs from the apartment he had just accidentally entered, a Precop jet pack in his hand. He hurried out of the house and once opening the door he threw the jet pack into one of the dumpsters. Anderton then broke out into a run and made a turn down one of the alley-ways. His breath was short and strong as he headed towards the car factory. Drawing near it he slowed down more into a jog and took a turn and found the car factory before him. The whining sound of an automobile reached his ears and as he looked around he found a black PT cruiser headed straight towards him. The car stopped abruptly as he placed his hands on the hood and stared into the windshield. And found: Federal agents. Witwer gave a cocky smile and waved at Anderton. Anderton felt anger rising in him as he looked around helplessly. She lied to me! He screamed in his head, Diana lied and told Witwer to meet me here! It was all a set up! He began to run past the car but Witwer quickly opened his door; so suddenly that Anderton couldn't stop his footing. Before he knew it he had smacked into the metal and went tumbling to the ground. But turning this more into a shoulder roll Witwer found that Anderton was back on his feet and running in no time. He growled slightly in his throat and jumped out of the car sprinting in the Chief's direction. Witwer brought in deep breaths as he pursued Anderton. Even though Diana denied that there was no romance between them, he still found himself jealous of the Precop. How come she'd turned on him? How come she deserted him to help Anderton? Why wasn't their love more important than friendship? Witwer felt his blood boil as he looked back on past events. How she had dumped him as she did. It was too much. Is this how it feels to have your heartbroken? Anderton quickly jumped up onto a metal yellow crate and entered the Lexus Car Factory. Witwer pulled himself to a stop and turned to enter through the entrance and pointed for his fellow agents to follow. Making a turn in the long hallways Witwer saw the quick image of Anderton as he ran into a room, the disappeared. He motioned for his agents to follow and as they entered the room they found that it was the heart of the factory. Machines buzzed and hummed as the moved around building cars. Sparks shot from one mechanical arm as it placed a bolt into a piece of metal. Witwer turned to his men and told them to split up. Each drew their stun gun and nodded. As for Witwer he turned and began to walk over to the machines. Alright Anderton , he thought, you want to play Hide-And-Go-Seek? Let's play Hide-And-Go-Seek . Coming across several containers of bolts Witwer bent down and checked for signs of hiding. Nothing. He moved on. --------------- Walking down one of the alleys Diana began to make her way to the Car Factory. She calmly took a turn and saw the large building, her destination, and a black PT cruiser. Her calmness disappeared and she felt worry enter her head. Oh no , she thought then muttered, \"Danny.\" She broke into a run and quickly entered the building. Diana moved as fast as she could down the halls and found a door with the noise of machines behind it. She opened it and looked around. \"John!\" she called out, then jogged more out in the open. As she looked around she noticed Witwer's goons as they stared up towards the ceiling. She frowned as she jogged forward standing next to them. The agent next to her turned to face her, \"Miss, what are you doing here?\"—He then grabbed her arm and began to lead her outside with the help of some other agents. She struggled but just didn't seem to match their strength—\"this area is restricted for people like you. Now I'm going to have to suggest that you stand outside.\" \"No!\" she protested, the looked up and saw what the agents had been staring at. A yellow platform up near the ceiling was holding Anderton and Witwer, who was throwing several punches at the ex-chief. She watched with fear as Witwer wasn't backing down and doing as much damage to Anderton as he could. What's he trying to do? She thought, kill him? Taking that thought into consideration, she screamed out, \"John!!\" ---------------- Witwer climbed up onto the yellow platform and taking out his rosary, he gently kissed it then placed it back under his shirt. Him and Anderton stared each other in the face, then slowly walked towards each other. \"I didn't do it,\" Anderton hissed. Witwer began to raise up his fists, \"Of course you didn't do it. That's why it's called Precrime.\" And then in that moment he reeled back and punched Anderton square in the face. A slight smirk appeared on his lips, man, that felt good . Catching his balance Anderton gave his head a good shake, then began to raise his own fists, \"You can't win Diana over by creating these lies, you know.\" The smirk quickly faded and his nostrils flared. \"Don't bring her into this!\" He shot back, then threw another punch, then another. \"It's you that tore us apart!\" he sneered. He reeled back again and this time his fist connected with Anderton's stomach and the Precop felt his air leave him. Winded Anderton grasped his stomach and felt a sharp pain in his cheek as Witwer lit into him with another punch. The agent couldn't help but tear into Anderton like this, he felt his anger calm. His jealousy disappear. This is what he had wanted to do for a long time. \"John!!\" A woman's yell entered his ears. Diana's yell. Witwer stopped and looked over at his fellow agents to find Diana struggling again them. His eyes softened and he felt his heart hurt. His pain soon changed as he felt Anderton's fist connect with his cheek. He looked over at him and his anger sparked even stronger than before. \"You two were going to meet?\" he growled. Anderton glared in return, \"Of course. But you should know since it was her who told you about it.\" Witwer frowned, \"She didn't tell me anything.\" Anderton paused in that split second, realizing that Diana had told him the truth. He had doubted his one true friend. Anderton, however, didn't have time for reflection. Seizing his chance, Witwer moved forward and threw another punch at Anderton. But this time, he blocked it. Witwer tried again and this time he moved forward with such force that he knocked Anderton back a few feet. Feeling his body come off the platform Anderton looked up and grabbed a handle bar swinging himself back around, directing his feet to Witwer's mouth. Taking the impact Witwer placed his hand to his mouth, tasting the coppery taste of blood. At this point of weakness Anderton hurried over to him and threw two punches at the agent then lit into the stomach, just as Witwer had done him. Only Anderton did it with more force than Witwer, and sent him into the air. Slowly recovering Witwer took a wild swing at Anderton, who quickly ducked giving the agent several more punches. Diana watched with fear as Witwer grew weak. He wasn't as coordinated as he started, and Anderton wasn't one to take fighting lightly. Witwer took another blind swing at Anderton and had the same results. \"John, stop!!\" Diana yelled breaking free of the agents and running towards the platform. The agents quickly regained their feet and began to run over to her. Anderton gave another powerful punch to Witwer, one that sent him back a little. He straightened up feeling his mouth. There was a small pleasure as he heard Diana beg Anderton to stop. It meant that she didn't want him to get hurt. Witwer felt himself having a new motivation. He quickly turned his head and spit out the blood in his mouth and raised his fists again. \"You wanna play rough?\" he hissed, \"fine then. Give me all you got.\" Anderton then threw a punch, only to miss. Witwer lit into him as he had done in the beginning, then backed up and charged him, grabbing onto his shirt. But he did this with such force, that they found themselves tumbling through the air and into a Lexus on the verge of being created. \"No!!\" Diana screamed and climbed up a case of stairs and worriedly looked over the rail at them. Sparks flew, literally, as Anderton and Witwer continued to fight. Mechanical arms swarmed over them, adjusting screws and adding car parts. Anderton quickly grabbed Witwer's throat and began to squeeze, choking him. Looking up Witwer quickly grabbed a mechanical arm and felt himself being pulled up out of the car. Watching them Diana soon felt a hand grab her wrist. \"Miss, you can't stay here,\" one of the agents told her. She jerked her arm out of his grasp and spun around only to lose her footing and feel herself fall over the rails. Witwer quickly tried to reach out and catch her but he missed and watched as she fell right on top of Anderton. She moaned as the Chief moved her off him. Suddenly though, one of the machines moved forward and pressed down on the metal, nearly chopping off Anderton's hand. And then, the top was forced on, and everything grew dark. ---------------- Landing back on the ground Witwer quickly hurried over to his agents and peered over the rail at the incomplete Lexus. He watched worriedly, hoping that Diana was ok. That she'd give a sign that she was alive. Surely she loved him enough to do that much. But there was nothing. No sign. He felt a pang in his heart again, and tightly closed his eyes to not let his emotions get a hold of him. He felt one of his agents tap him on the shoulder, \"Uh, Sir…\" He quickly turned to the agent and punched him squarely in the cheek. Knocking him off his feet and onto the floor. \"Idiots!!\" he yelled at them, then began to run off where the painting of the car would occur. --------------- Witwer watched hopefully as one Lexus began to be painted red. Please , he begged in his mind, please be ok . And almost as if she replied, Diana stuck her head up and looked out the window of the red Lexus, followed by Anderton. Witwer gave a relieved sigh. Anderton slightly smiled then whispered to Diana, \"Don't take this personal.\" She frowned at him, only too soon. Anderton drew her to him and then kissed her. They slowly broke apart and he looked over to Witwer with a smug smile, then waved. Witwer felt his blood boil and he let out a growl. He took in deep angry breaths as he slowly followed the car, then pounded his hand into his fists and broke out into a run to the exit door. But as he reached where Anderton's car was Anderton quickly pressed the gas and began to speed out into the open. Witwer angrily ran as fast as he could, chasing the car to all of his ability. But out of breath he stopped, and watched them disappear. ---------------- \"What did you do that for?\" Diana asked shocked. Anderton slightly smiled, \"Just wanted to make Witwer mad.\" She frowned at him, \"How?\" Anderton looked over at her, \"He still loves you. And I feel like he wants to prove something to you by catching me.\" Diana was silent, turning her head to look out the window. Anderton glanced over at her but remained quiet. \"Where are you headed?\" she asked. \"To Hineman.\" Diana stared out the window blankly, \"Drop me off here.\" Anderton frowned looking over at her, \"What?\" \"I know we were supposed to meet up but, I think I have an idea about who set you up. And I need to check it out.\" \"But, we do know. It's Witwer.\" She was silent for a moment, \"Yes, but we need more proof.\" Anderton stopped the Lexus. \"Alright then.\" \"See you soon, John,\" She called back as she got out of the car and shut the door. He then went speeding off, wheels screeching. --------------- Witwer stared out the window of the black PT cruiser dazedly. His jaws viciously chomping on a piece of gum while his mind thought up violent torture for Anderton. He knew for sure now that Anderton and Diana were behind something. And he needed to find out what. The agent that was driving looked over at Witwer and noticed his aggravation, \"Something troubling you, Sir?\" \"Nothing Foley. Just drive.\" Foley frowned at him and went back to watching the road. He continued this for a while, then a question formed in his mind. \"That girl, did you two—\" \"Just shut up and drive!\" Witwer shot back at him quickly. \"Fine, fine,\" he replied, \"No need to get your feathers all ruffled. I just was wondering because there she is walking down the street.\" Witwer shot up straight and eagerly looked out the window in the direction Foley was pointing. And there she was, Diana. Without looking over at his fellow agent Witwer demanded, \"Drive over next to her.\" Obeying what he said Foley drove over and slowed down to her pace. She looked over as Witwer rolled down the window. \"Nothing between you and Anderton, huh?\" he taunted. Her eyes shot back to the sidewalk and she quickened her pace. Witwer told Foley to speed up. \"Well,\" he continued, \"Are you going to speak to me?\" She tried to ignore him as long as possible, but she couldn't take it. She looked over at him, \"Just leave me alone, Danny.\" She continued walking to hear the car stop and a car door open and then shut. She sped up her pace even more. But when she reached a turn in the sidewalk she felt a hand on her shoulder. She shrugged it off. \"Diana,\" he said, \"This is my job. I'm sorry to do what I'm doing but I have no choice.\" She turned to him and said, \"That's where you're wrong. This isn't your job. It was never your job. It was mine, it was Gordon's, it was Jeff's…it was John's. You didn't have to take over, you just decided to.\" Witwer looked away and noticed her beginning to walk off. He grabbed her arm, \"Don't leave! I'm not done.\" She glared at him. \"Look, why don't you just go ahead and explain to me what Anderton was doing kissing you, if you aren't romantically connected. I've been wondering about that.\" \"He just wanted to make you mad,\" she replied, \"He said you still love me.\" Witwer glanced away, lost for words. He sighed. \"Well,\" he began, \"can you at least explain to me why you hate me. I don't exactly know what I did wrong.\" \"You lied to me,\" she told him, her voice quivering slightly, \"you used me. I have been lied to all my life and I can't stand it when someone does it.\" \"Diana, when has someone—\" \"There are some lines that you shouldn't cross.\" \"Look, please don't tell me it has to be like this,\" he begged, \"You have to at least feel something for me deep in your heart. Otherwise, why would you not want Anderton to hurt me?\" He looked into her eyes to see them begin to water. He started to reach out to her to comfort her but she stepped back. He looked at her pleadingly. \"I'm sorry Danny,\" she replied, then ran off. -------------- Anderton pulled his car into a dirt driveway far away from civilization. Getting out he looked around at the surrounding of trees and other plants. It made him miss his own home in the country. He looked over at an old metal mail box reading: Hineman. This was the right place. He walked down the tranquil path towards her front door, but knew he wouldn't be welcomed. Hineman enjoyed her privacy, and didn't like to be disturbed. Seeing a tree right next to her stone fence lined with glass shards at the top, he began to climb up it. Stepping over the glass he jumped down onto the other side. Then he heard the noise of something behind him. Plant-like arms reached out to him, and grabbed him. He tried to pull away but the plant's grasp was strong. Anderton felt the leathery-leafy whips rub against his skin, caressing it. Then, he felt a sharp pain in his neck. He swatted away whatever bit him and struggled to pull away from the plant. Freeing his arms he fell to the ground, then crawled a distance away to freedom. Standing up he looked back at the plant, its whips of vines settling down again to be hidden next to the wall for another trespasser to try and break in. He turned to find Hineman's greenhouse. The pain in his neck was unbearable, and it felt like he couldn't breathe anymore. He placed his hand up to his neck and felt where the plant had torn his skin. Wincing he moved on, his breathing deep and heavy. He walked up to the doors and reached out for the doorknob weakly, then steadying himself opened it. And there revealed Dr. Iris Hineman, an old woman of about fifty tending to her plants with a wide brimmed hat and her gardening attire. \"Dr. Hineman,\" Anderton whispered weakly. \"You're trespassing,\" she told him without moving her eyes from a plant she was tending to, \"I don't have visitors.\" Anderton swayed slightly and gave a choked cough. It felt like his whole esophagus was being ripped out of him. He touched his scratch and gave raspier breathing. Hineman looked over at him. \"Oh, I believe that would be from the Doll's Eye, the vine—the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall. It's not a true Doll's Eye of course. It's a little hybrid of my own design. It's quite something. Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see what I can only describe as the most extraordinary display of blue objects.\" Anderton weakly rested himself on a table, struggling for air. He was beginning to feel dizzy, disoriented. He stood up and tried to walk over to Hineman but found himself collapsing on her. She caught him and held him up, \"This just isn't you're week, is it, Chief Anderton?\" Anderton looked up at her slowly and said as best as he could, \"I'm not a killer.\" ---------------- Taking some herbs and medicine Hineman smashed them over a drain into a cup, letting the liquid fill it up. \"You better drink this,\" she told him as she handed him the cup, \"soon you won't be able to swallow and them you'll be totally buggered.\" She placed the cup to his mouth and began to tilt it upward, letting him drink. At the very taste of the medicine Anderton made a noise from beneath the cup and rose up his hand to knock the horrible stuff away, but he was too weak. \"All of it,\" Hineman demanded. Pouring the rest of it into him Hineman moved the cup away from his mouth and placed her hand on his cheek. \"Ok, now take a minute to right yourself,\" she told him as he stared cautiously into her eyes. He could never be too careful. Witwer could have this place surrounded in less than a minute. She then sat the cup down and picking up a pair of pruning shears began to move some yellow flowers. \"Just, uh, what is it you think I can do for you?\" Anderton leaned over breathing in the fresh air as his esophagus returned to him and felt his breathing return to normal. \"You can tell me how someone…can fake a prevision,\" he replied breathy. \"How would I know that?\" she asked looking over at him. Anderton took another lungful of air, \"You invented Precrime.\" She chuckled bitterly as she continued her walk to a table. \"What's so funny?\" Anderton asked. \"If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, yes, then I invented Precrime.\" \"You don't seem all that proud.\" \"I'm not. I was trying heal them, not turn them into something else.\" \"Heal who?\" \"The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.\" She sat the plant she was carrying down. \"You're talking about…the precogs.\" \"You think the three in the tank come from a test tube? They're merely the ones who survived.\"—Anderton looked at her suspicious, yet curious—\"I was doing genetic research at the Woodhaven Clinic treating children drug addicts. This was ten years ago when marijuana first hit the streets. It was an impure form of the drug not the engineered cocktail that became so popular among the more…educated.\" Anderton placed his hand to his mouth, thinking deeply. \"All of these kids were born,\" Hineman continued, \"with server brain damage. Most died before the age of twelve. There was few, those precious few. They had a gift, it was called a gift but to them it was more of a cosmic joke. They would wake up in the night, crawled up in the corner of their room screaming, clawing at the wallpaper because when these little children, you see, closed their eyes they dreamt only of murder over and over, one after the other. It didn't take long enough for us to realize that the real nightmare was that these so-called dreams were about to come true. These murders were actually happening.\" Anderton was silent. Things that were clear became foggy. What he knew seemed to disappear in an instant. He cut his eyes upward to Hineman, \"You say some of the children died?\" Hineman slightly nodded her head, \"Oh, so many of them…despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them.\" Anderton frowned, \"You sound as if the three we have aren't the only ones that survived.\" Hineman bit her lip. She turned away and began pruning the plant she had, \"I've said too much.\" \"There are others?!\" Anderton looked at her shocked, \"You mean we could have precogs walking the streets at this very moment? Predicting murders? Telling murderers about their future?\" \"What do you think?\" Hineman replied turning to him and speaking sharply, \"I never intended for those unfortunate three to become what they became. They have no life now! They are treated not as humans but more as a piece of machinery! Yes, there still are some from my experiment walking the streets; I doubt they're telling murderers their future. To be more exact they take part in stopping it. They're all around the states, stopping murders from happening, even though they're not in Precrime. Very little though. I only had so much time before Lamar came and got the three. But, that doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now isn't it?\" Anderton jumped up from his seat, stunned by what his ears had just heard. He followed Hineman as she walked over to another plant with a watering can in her hands, \"I'm not going to commit murder. I've never met the person I'm supposed to kill.\" \"And yet, a chain of events has started. A chain that will leave inexorably to his death.\" \"Not if I stay away from him.\" \"How can you avoid a man you never met?\" \"So you won't help me?\" \"I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.\" She handed him her watering can as she finished squirting the plants. He held it silently, his mind wondering if it was true. If he truly was going to murder somebody. Hineman moved on and as she walked over to a chair she chipped off a piece of bark, \"But occasionally, they do disagree.\" Anderton looked over at her, \"What?\" \"Most of the time, all three Precogs will see an event the same way. But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.\" He followed her, \"Jesus Christ—why didn't I know about this?\" \"Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.\" \"Why?\" She turned to him, \"Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility. After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt? It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.\" \"Are you saying that I've halo'd innocent people?\" Hineman walked over to a bed of living moving flowers and bent down, her face right in front of them. They moved their long flexible stems and reached out, caressing her skin and rubbing her cheek. Almost like a child to a mother. \"I'm saying that every so often those accused of a Precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.\" \"Does Burgess know about this? About the…Minority Report?\" Hineman smiled as she pet her beauties and fed them, \"I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime. Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.\" Her voice grew soft and weak as Anderton marched over and grabbed her arm turning her to face him. He was tired of her riddles; he wanted a straight forward answer. And he was getting agitated, \"Answer my question. Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?\" As he finished his question one of the flowers shot forward aggressively and did what it considered, hurting him on the cheek. He winced and pulled away from the creature, it was harmless and didn't truly bite him, but he didn't seem to favor these plants with emotions. \"Yes, of course, he knew,\" she walked over and picking a yellow flower moved it over to another table, \"but at the time, he felt—we both felt their existence was…an insignificant variable.\" Anderton walked over to her, \"Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures? My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not—\" \"The system would collapse,\" Hineman finished for him, then walked over to a table and began to fix her a cup of tea. \"I believe in that system.\" \"Do you really?\" \"You want to bring it down.\" \"But you will bring it down…if you manage to kill your victim. Oh my, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime…didn't work.\" She sat down. \"I'm not gonna kill anybody.\" \"Hold that thought.\" \"Why should I trust you?\" \"You shouldn't. You shouldn't trust anyone…certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself. Not the young federal agent who wants your job and to win the girl he loves. Not the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created. Not even the young girl that's managed to save you from getting arrested. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report.\" Anderton looked down to the ground. Not trust Diana? She was the only one on his side! What could he do? He frowned at Hineman, \"You said they're destroyed.\" \"I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time. I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place—but not declared.\" \"What safe place is that?\" \"The safest place there is.\" She began to raise the cup of tea to her mouth when Anderton placed his hand on it, stopping her and squatting down to eye level. \"Where is it?\" Hineman took her hand off the cup and placed it on Anderton's head and whispered into his ear, \"Inside the precog who predicted it.\" She brought her face to his and kissed him passionately. Anderton stared at her shocked, and slightly disgusted, when she pulled his face away. Her wrinkly hands holding his chin. \"All you have to do is download it, darling.\" \"That's all, huh?\" He replied getting up, \"Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the pre-cogs, and then download this Minority Report…\" \"If you have one,\" Hineman pointed out. \"—and then walk out.\" \"Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.\" \"You're insane\"—a flower bloomed right behind him as he spoke, its vines reaching out to him. He scooted away from it—\"or you think I am. I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within TEN MILES of Precrime! They'll pick me up…\" Hineman stood up and placed her cup of tea on the table, \"Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.\"—she walked over to him—\"As a policeman—oh, excuse me—a former policeman I'm sure you know all sorts of people who could…help you out in this regard.\" Anderton thought about what she suggested as she walked over to the newly bloomed flower and placed her hand on one of the thorny vines. \"It's funny,\" she said, \"how all living organisms are alike. When the chips are down, when the pressure is on\"—she squeezed the vine tightly in her hand and the plant began to struggle—\"every creature on the face of the earth is interested in one thing and one thing only:\"—The vine whipped out of her hand and when she showed it to Anderton he saw a long bloody gash on it—\"Its own survival. Find the Minority Report.\" She then began to wrap her hand with her handkerchief. Anderton was silent for a moment. \"How do I even know which one has it?\" \"It's always in the more gifted of the three,\" she picked up her watering can and began spraying the flowers again. \"Which one is that?\" She looked back at him, a look that seemed to say, isn't it obvious? \"The female.\" And then went back to squirting as Anderton thought about this. He looked at her, \"Let's say I do find this 'Minority Report'.\"—he brought his hands up imitating quotation marks—\"What do I do after that?\" \"Find who set you up of course.\" Anderton frowned at her, \"But I know—\" \"You can't make a decision until you've been show the complete evidence. What you need to do after finding—or not finding—the Minority Report is search for the female's sister.\" Anderton looked at her in shock, \"The female…precog? You mean Agatha has a sister?\" Hineman looked down sadly, as if she regretted what she had just said, then slightly nodded. \"Yes, there is another murder tied in with your troubles and Agatha's sister can help you. She knows more about the murder than anyone else. Even Agatha herself.\" Anderton nodded repeating this information and his tasks in his head, then nodded good-bye and walked out the door. Hineman watched him leave with a strange sadness. \"Forgive me,\" she whispered to herself, almost as if the person she was asking forgiveness for would hear her plead. She had broken her promise to Agatha's sister, and that was to never tell anyone about her.[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect. I am not making a profit from this story. I will say that I own the character Diana Warren, and that no one else can use her unless it's with my permission. P/L: It is the year 2054. A so-called \"pre-crime division\" is working around Washington DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. But soon a Federal agent comes snooping around headquarters in search of flaws. Human flaws. And the main man on his list is John Anderton, a firm believer in the system, that is, before it came after him. With the help of one of his closest friends, Diana Warren, Anderton has to prove that he's innocent, even if it means that the system will be shut down. But there's a secret that's being hidden from them all, and it's right in front of them. Ch. 6: Addicted After analyzing Anderton's crime for the thousandth time, Witwer walked over and sat down at Anderton's desk. Suddenly, a black woman walked over to him, \"Excuse me, this is Chief Anderton's space. You can't sit in his space.\" Taking off his glasses Witwer glanced back at her, \"He won't be here anymore.\" \"He'll be back!\" \"I doubt it.\" Geez, why was everybody so harsh on him now? He can't help it if Anderton is about to be a murderer! Jad walked over to the woman and began to move her along. She looked over at him in disgust, \"What happened to you?\" It was true though, something had happened to them. They had turned against their own Chief; the man who believed so strong in the system. \"In the meantime I bet he's somewhere in the sprawl. Anderton's smart enough to go where there's electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket. There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.\" Witwer continued with his reasoning. Knott began, \"Why wouldn't he just run?\" \"Because he thinks he's innocent.\" Witwer chuckled slightly to the thought. How could Anderton be innocent? \"We concentrate on the sprawl,\" he continued, \"We do overflies in ships with two spyder teams on the ground. Go building by building. Thermal scan the whole area, read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.\" Witwer slightly spun his chair, and as he turned towards Anderton's computer, he noticed an image card slightly hidden beneath the keyboard. He reached in and pulled it out, inspecting it, and found it being a familiar case. It was the Anne Lively drowning. But the most intriguing thing about it was: why would Anderton have an image card of this? What's so important about the drowning? He pulled out the keyboard and checked for more trinkets left behind. None. And then his eyes switched to something else, a picture. It was of Anderton's wife and son. He looked up at Fletcher, \"Where is she?\" ---------------- John Anderton walked around the city slums, unsure what to do next. He'd never really been here without a map, he'd never really wanted to. But still he had to find someone who could help him, someone who could help him get Agatha. But how could he do that? To have someone help you means you have to trust them. And trusting was one thing he couldn't do. There was a hand on his arm. He quickly jumped back and turned around; it was a homeless man on his knees. His scraggly and sunken in face stared at him desperately, \"Just a little money, please! Please, I'm so hungry…\" Anderton backed away, his blue-green eyes wide with fright. His mind wasn't functioning. Things like this usually didn't bother him, but that was when he was a Precop. When he had a badge. People didn't dare bother him with a badge, and if they did, he at least had a sick stick. Anderton turned and began to run. Gotta keep runnin'… \"Please!!\" the homeless man cried after him, \"God! All I want is something to eat!\" His wrinkled face winced, tears dripping down him. He buried his face in his hands and sobbed. He was starving. Anderton stopped at a trash can out of breath. Suddenly, he heard his cell phone ring. He worriedly looked down at the object, as if he had never seen it before. Hesitating, he reached for it. And as he flipped up the screen he saw Diana's name move across. Answer it? Yes…no…is this how it feels to be a criminal? To tense at every noise, run at the sound of footsteps, have your heart racing all the time. But wait, he wasn't a criminal. Not yet. He was innocent. That's right. He doesn't even know a Leo Crow. Everything's going to be fine. The phone rung again. Not even the young girl that's managed to save you from getting arrested. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report , Hineman's words echoed in his head. Find the Minority Report… Anderton bit his lip, then pressed the talk button. He didn't care what Hineman said, Diana was the only one who could help him right now. \"John?\" Her picture came through a little fuzzy and her voice crackled slightly, \"You okay? You look terrible.\" Letting his breath return to normal Anderton nodded. Diana glanced around and looked as if she was trying to avoid anyone from hearing her. \"Look, I've got an idea. You can't get into city without getting EYEdentiscanned right? Well, I know this guy and…he can help you. His name is Dr. Solomon Eddie. He's a…eye doctor. A good one at that.\" She then gave him directions to Dr. Eddie's office and Anderton nodded soaking up all the information. \"But, Diana,\" he began, frowning, \"how do you know—\" The screen grew fuzzier and static could be heard louder, \"I'm sorry John, what'd you say?\" Anderton began to repeat it and Diana frowned, \"Look, the reception's real bad where I am. I'll call you back in a better spot, see you.\" He began to reply, \"Good-bye\" but he heard the sound of her already hanging up. That was odd. Shrugging, he headed off in the directions she had given him. --------------- Diana shut the cover of her cell phone and placed it in her pocket. \"Man,\" She said, looking around the area, which didn't have bad reception, \"Too close.\" She then began to move forward and walked to the nearest taxi. She smiled at the man as she hailed him down. \"Hey, um, can you take me to Chesapeake Bay?\" She asked. The man nodded, \"Jump in.\" -------------- Anderton cringed as he looked at the sign for Dr. Eddie's office. You wouldn't even call it an office. It was an apartment in a motel. A nasty motel at that. Eye doctor, huh? He thought, Diana, what are you getting me into? Pushing on the door he found it was unlocked and frowned as he entered. Staring around the room he found it was just as terrible and grimy as everything else there was here. Anderton's eyes then focused on a rather lousy holo-screen where an old gangster movie was playing. On the screen there seemed to be a guy who was out of breath, Anderton's paranoid mind connected it to the thought that the man had run out of breath from running from the law. Then, the door burst open. Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! The breathless man lets out an agonizing scream as he gets filled full of lead by a gangster. On no , Anderton thought, never mind. He was the good guy . His thought echoed through his head, the good guy… That was him. He turned away from the TV as his paranoia kicked in and brought his attention to the foul smelling kitchen where he saw dirty dishes piled waiting to be clean. He moved his eyes swearing that he saw something growing on there and that he was going to be sick. Then, he noticed several utensils that were laid out on a table. He brushed his hand across them, then moved over to a black box and opened it. Seeing the eye removal headpiece Anderton worriedly backed away. He was beginning to understand Diana's idea. Going back forward he picked up the headpiece and began to study it when he heard a sneeze filled with mucus. He turned around, and there was Dr. Eddie, or so he guessed. A tall, sickly looking Swedish man. The doctor wiped the dangling snot off with his hand and rubbed it off on his shirt. \"This cold won't go away!\" Anderton frowned uneasily. Dr. Eddie looked up and smiled at him. He's anxious, he thought. The doctor rose his hand for Anderton to calm down, \"Don't worry. I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection. Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.\" \"That's comforting.\" Anderton replied, though his face didn't show it, \"Uh, look, my friend told me to come here, I have no clue why she wanted me to go but she said you could help me from being EYEdentiscanned.\" \"Indeed I can!\"—Eddie offered a grimy hand, but instead of taking it Anderton just gave a nod—\"Doctor Solomon Eddie at your service. I can change your eye pattern so as the EYEdentiscanners won't recognize you as John Anderton.\" Anderton frowned, shocked the doctor knew his name, \"How'd you?—\" Eddie smiled, \"Small world. News travels fast.\" Anderton nodded slightly, his mind cursing Diana for directing him to a quack, then headed over to the working utensils. He wanted to know just what would be jabbed into his precious blue-greens. Eddie leaned over slightly and pointed at his eyes, \"You do understand I can't just give you new irises\"—Anderton began to touch the tools again when Eddie stopped him—\"Uh, please don't touch. The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear…\" \"Right. I know—\" Anderton wasn't able to finish. Suddenly there was a vicious pain in his arm and noticed Eddie had stuck him with something. Out of reflex Anderton grabbed his arm and threw him over to the table and pressed him onto it, holding his hands behind his back. \"What was that?\" Anderton asked angrily, then took the needle out of Eddie's hand as he failed to answer and showed it to his face, \"Huh? What was that?\" \"It's an-anesthesia,\" Eddie managed out, \"It's all going to be down hill…\" \"You sneak up on you're patients like that?\" \"You wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before a concert,\" Eddie winced, \"Please, relax.\" Anderton's grip loosened and he slowly backed away from Eddie. Painfully the doctor rose up from the table and turned to him, \"All I'm saying is that I'll have to remove your eyes…completely.\" \"No, no.\" Anger was boiling in him; he was going to hurt Diana if he lived to see her again. \"And replace them with new ones.\" Anderton inspected his wound, \"I wanna keep the old ones.\" \"Why?\" He turned his head away from his injection and raised an eyebrow at Eddie, \"Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.\" Eddie raised his hands in defense, \"Whatever you say is your money.\" He then held out his hand and let John hand him a tiny opalescent card. Dr. Eddie began to speak in Swedish and looked over at another room, \"Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant: Miss Van Eyck.\" Anderton turned to hear the toilet flush and a large blonde woman walk out, a humongous dark mole on her face. She seemed to be singing something in Swedish as she walked over to Dr. Eddie. In fact, that was all she knew. Anderton could feel the lightheadedness rush in on him and he began to feel as if he might fall down. He walked over and leaned over a table. \"This is not a lot of money!\" Eddie called out. \"It's all I could safely move,\" he replied. Miss Eyck moved forward, the constant chatter of her voice sounding like nothing but gibberish to Anderton, and she placed his arm around her shoulder and carried him over to the patient's chair. Situating him Anderton asked, \"What'd you give me?\" Eddie picked up his eye removal headpiece and began adjusting it, \"Smiling medicine. Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount. Whaddaya say? You don't remember me do you?\" A large stupid grin fell across Anderton's face, one he had no control over, \"We know each other?\" \"Oh yes, we do.\" \"From where? D.C.?\" \"Uh, Baltimore.\" \"Eastside?\" \"Yea,\" Eddie nodded smiling. \"We go way back.\" Anderton began to slightly laugh, only, it wasn't funny. In fact, he felt hysterical right now. He couldn't stop laughing. \"Solomon P. Eddie M.D.,\" Eddie continued, \"I was a plastic surgeon. You remember? Specialized in burnt victims? Mostly women.\" Anderton remembered now, though his emotions of shock were blocked by the concrete smile on his face, \"I put you away.\" \"Oh yeah.\" He laughed, \"You made those tapes.\" \"They were performance pieces!\" \"You set…\" Anderton began to stand up, \"your patients on fire.\" Eddie reached out and stopped him from going anywhere then forcefully pushed him back down into the chair, \"And put them out! Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?\" Eddie placed the eye-removal headpiece on Anderton's head, \"The future is much more interesting than the past. Don't you think?\" Anderton lied back in his chair. Eddie looked over as his assistant walked out of the cooler and handed him a plastic bag that contained two perfect eyes. \"Oh, Miss Van Eyck. She has already smitten,\" Eddie looked over at John, \"She only has…eyes for you.\" Dr. Eddie began to place the grippers of the head ornament on his eyelids, pulling them back painfully, \"I know what you're thinking, John. How can I do what I do now? Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library. Now that was a great way to avoid some of the more unpleasant aspects of prison life. Confinement was a real education, a real eye opener.\" Eddie moved away from Anderton to his computer where a laser came down and scanned John's eyes. Annoyingly, Miss Eyck began chatting again in her foreign tongue. \"I mean,\" Eddie continued, \"For the true enlightment, John, there's nothing quite like the experience of, well let's say, taking a shower while a large felon with an attitude you can't know down with a hammer whispers in your ear, 'Oh Nancy, oh Nancy.' Now that was a lot of fun. Thank you so much, John, for putting me in there. For giving me the opportunity to get to know myself better. And now…\" Eddie moved his laser pen to the screen showing John's eyeball, squirming in its socket, \"To return the favor.\" -------------- \"Thank you,\" Diana told the taxi driver as she handed him her money. The taxi driver nodded, \"No problem.\" He then backed up, and drove off. She smiled looking around at the scenery. There was something about it. Peaceful, warm, filled with love. As she walked down the path and glanced out at the water she could find herself picturing the Anderton family before their lives fell apart. Lara sitting on the side of the beach, a smile on her face and a gentle laugh as John played with Sean in the water. Growling playfully John would pick him up, the young boy laughing to his heart's content. Calling out with each break from his giggles to make an attempt to stop his daddy from tickling him, \"Mommy! Make him stop!!\" As she blinked, she felt a tear run down her eye. She ended the thought and told herself she didn't need to think about things like that. Any death was painful for everyone, and all she could think about lately was her mother…She never came back…In fact; she could barely remember how her mother died. That was all she knew. But yet, things seemed to come to her every now and again, as if they were merely boxed away for a day like this. Diana stopped in her tracks. There, in the driveway, was a white Lexus. \"No,\" she muttered, \"not him. Please, not him.\" Her feet broke into a run. She entered the house and called out her name, \"Lara?\" No answer. She moved on and heard voices coming from the black room. \"…So what? You loose your son; let's see how you handle it!\" It was Lara's voice. And to Diana's dismay, she heard Witwer reply, \"Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.\" Even though anger burned within her, she couldn't help but feel butterfly's fluttering in her stomach with love at the sound of his voice. She burst into the room, \"Lara?\" Both Witwer and Lara looked in her direction. And as Diana looked at them she saw their faces unbelievably close, and for once she felt a tinge of jealousy. Lara backed away; her eyes moved back to Witwer angrily, \"I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him.\"—She began to walk over to Diana and hug her. She turned to Witwer, who still hadn't taken his eyes off Diana, and glared—\"Now you can leave.\"—She turned back to Diana—\"Diana, what are you doing here? It's been a while.\" She smiled slightly, \"Yes it has.\" Witwer slightly walked forward, \"Yeah, Diana. What are you doing here?\" She glared at him, \"I was going to ask you the same question.\" \"I'm doing my job. In fact, I was just about to ask Lara if she'd help me.\" \"To do what?\" Lara spat, \"Trap him?\" \"No, prevent a murder. Sooner or later you know he's going to contact you.\" \"I haven't seen him in two years.\" \"But I've seen three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.\" Diana glanced over at Lara to find she had placed her hand to her mouth, fighting tears. She could read what Lara was thinking: He still loves me? \"He's still living with you. And your son. You have to choose, Lara. You have to choose sides now.\" Seeing Lara's pain, Diana looked over at him, \"She told you to leave, Danny.\" Witwer stared at her, \"You never answered my question.\" \"I've come her to talk to Lara,\" she explained. Witwer slightly smiled, \"There's more to it isn't there?\" \"Maybe.\" He slightly laughed looking away. \"So you're still helping him?\" \"Do you think I'm gonna answer that?\" \"No, no of course not. That would mean you'd be helping me and we can't have that can we?\" Lara's face changed back to the normal sternness she showed Witwer, and looked over at Diana, \"You're helping him?\" \"I believe he's innocent.\" Lara turned to Witwer, \"I believe I've chosen my side, Mr. Witwer. Now you can leave.\" Witwer looked at her disappointed. \"Leave, Danny.\" Diana concurred. \"You know, I truly should stay here and listen to what you have to say. Considering I don't need to let emotions effect my work, but I respect that you're too stubborn to let me do anything like that.\" He smiled and there was a twinkle in his brown-green eyes. Diana wanted to stay stern, but she couldn't help but smile back as Witwer turned and left the room. Anderton's words popped into her head, \"How do you do it?\" \"Do what?\" \"Get that little smartass to listen to you?\" Her smile grew as she realized the true answer, because he loves me . Lara stared at her, a small smile on her lips, \"You like him, don't you?\" Diana sharply turned her head, \"What? Yes, once. I can't stand him now, though.\" \"'Cause he sure as anything likes you.\" She smiled slightly, \"That's not important right now.\" Lara raised an arched eyebrow. \"I think you two'd make a perfect couple.\" \"Come on, let's get serious.\" \"Alright, alright.\" \"I've been talking to John, helping him out, y'know?\" Lara nodded. \"And I think Witwer's on the right track. It's almost positive that John's gonna contact you. You and me are the only two he has left to trust, and I was wondering, if he came here, would you be willing to help him?\" Lara was quiet for a moment, \"Yes…yes I believe I would.\"—She glanced away, smiled slightly—\"I guess I've been trying to tell myself this whole time that divorce was the right thing, but I don't believe it's helped either of us. It sounds as if he still loves me, and I still love him.\" Diana smiled also, seeing that it seemed a mistake could never break true love. And then it hit her, she was the same way. She was trying to ignore her feelings, when it was true. She didn't hate Danny. And, deep in her heart, she didn't believe it was him who set John up. \"Would you like to sit down?\" Lara asked breaking through her thoughts, \"I've got some cake in the oven. Would you like some?\" She nodded as she sat down in one of the chairs, \"That would be great.\" Bringing out the cake and cutting a slice, Lara glanced over at Diana, \"Is that all you were wondering?\" \"Well,\" Diana leaned back off the table as Lara set her slice down in front of her, \"I wanted to get a little more information about John.\" Lara stopped in the middle of sitting down, a shocked expression on her face, \"We haven't talked in forever, how can I tell you anything you want to know?\" \"Because what I want to know is in the past.\" Lara finished sitting down and looked at her rather haggard, \"Ok.\" \"When John joined, was there ever a mentioning of the murder about Anne Lively?\" \"No, not that I can remember. But John never really mentioned everything that went on in work.\" Diana began to eat her cake, \"What about Lamar and John's relationship?\" \"They were just like father and son,\" Lara smiled, and began to eat her cake, \"They would always joke around together.\" \"Has Lamar ever acted secretive to you?\" \"No. Where you headed with this Diana?\" \"I don't know. I just need to cover all the angles. Just because we trust someone doesn't mean that they're not a suspect. A lot of mistakes are made that way.\" \"So who do you believe framed John?\" \"I truly don't know at the moment. I'm working on it, and I'm pretty sure right now it wasn't Danny.\" \"What?\" \"I know it seems obvious that he did it but, let's face it. He only had three days to gather the knowledge he needed before John's murder was predicted. How could he have figured out the system good enough to do that? Not even John knew about the Minority Report until now.\" Lara frowned, \"Minority Report?\" \"It's when the Precogs disagree on a murder. And a lot of times when they disagree it means that that person may be innocent.\" \"How do you know if John never knew?\" \"I, uh, I've talked to Dr. Hineman recently. John told me that he was going to speak to her.\" Lara nodded and continued to eat her piece of cake. As for Diana, she placed her fork on the plate and sighed, \"That was great, but, I need to go.\"—She looked at her watch—\"I've still got some more investigating to do before the day's over.\" Lara smiled slightly and stood up when she stood up, \"Ok. Be careful, dear.\" Diana nodded and as she began to walk off she looked back, \"Bye.\" Lara followed her to the door, but as she stepped out and looked in the driveway she still saw the white Lexus. Along with Witwer leaning up against it with his arms crossed. He looked up at her and smiled. \"You're still here?\" She asked in shock. Witwer shrugged, \"I noticed you didn't have a ride into town. Thought I could help.\" She glanced back at Lara who was smiling at her. She then brought her focus back to him, \"Well, Lara could always drive me to the city if I needed someone to. You could've left.\" \"I wanted to.\" He then opened up the passenger door, \"So, what is it, yes or no?\" She sighed and stepped into the car. Smiling, Witwer closed the door and went over to the other side and got in himself. \"Y'know,\" Diana told him as he brought the gear out of park, \"I'm only doing this cos this is my only other way to get to the city.\" Witwer turned to look out the back window as he backed up, \"Oh, I know.\" \"I still hate you,\" she told him as he began to drive down the dirt road. He smiled and slightly laughed, \"I know.\" That was their only conversation for the whole ride. The rest was silent. And as Witwer pulled the car into the parking lot of Precrime headquarters they found that it was drawing near to dusk. Parking the car he hopped out and opened the door for Diana. \"Thank you,\" she told him as she got out of her seat, trying to avoid his eyes. But as she stood up, she found herself standing uncomfortably close to him. And her eyes failed to do as they were suppose to do and took a quick glance up at his handsome face. She looked away. Their faces, their bodies, they were so close. And her heard was beating like crazy and she wondered worriedly to herself if he could hear it, because it would be obvious that she loved him then. Witwer leaned forward, and as she looked back at him she saw his lips slightly pucker, but found he merely was starting to say, \"You're welcome.\" He continued to stare at her though. His cheek slightly quivered and his lips moved nervously. Even though she was sure that it was probably the gum, he seemed to look as if he was deciding whether he should kiss her or not. She began to back away to a more comfortable distance and saw the disappointment in Witwer's face. She then figured that he probably did these acts of kindness to win her back. And in the end the rejoined lovers were suppose to kiss. Well, it didn't work that way. Diana didn't care if she found him so attractive, he wasn't going to win. I don't love him anymore , she told herself, he's just an old boyfriend . Nothing more . She then began to walk off. And only looked back to say, \"Good-bye.\" \"Good-bye!\" He called back, and sadly began to walk up the Precrime headquarter steps. What did he ever do to her? Why did she hate him so bad? He tried to be nice. To act friendly, but she only shunned him away. He sighed. Diana herself was having second thoughts. Did she truly have a reason to hate him? To treat him like this? She just told Lara she didn't think he did it. So what's she doing? Stopping, she wiped a tear away from her face. Maybe she was afraid to be around him. Unsure what might happen. And then there was John. Would Danny use her again? Would he make her contact John and get him to fall right into their hands? She wasn't like that, and she didn't want to lose John's trust. But she knew that half of her wanted to turn around. To run to Witwer and wrap her arms around him and feel his warmth. She could even find herself considering it, but for some reason, she didn't stray from her course. She glanced back and watched him for a brief moment walk into the headquarters. And she smiled. She didn't want to admit it, but she knew she was in love. And maybe that's why she hadn't asked for forgiveness. She had never felt this way before, and it was frightening. She wasn't sure if she could handle a love that she had no cure for. -------------- There was a knock on the Burgess's house door. Getting up from one of their sofa chairs Mrs. Burgess walked forward to answer it. Opening the door she smiled as she saw Diana. \"Why, hello Diana,\" she said. Diana smiled back, \"Hi, look, sorry to come see you two so late but something's been on my mind and I need to speak to Lamar.\" Mrs. Burgess nodded and turning her head called out, \"Lamar! There's someone here to see you!\"—She then turned back to her—\"Come on in, dear.\" Stepping inside Diana found her way to the living room where Lamar sat. Sitting down she looked over at him. \"Feeling better?\" she asked. \"Oh yes,\" Lamar replied, \"As much as I hate herbal tea it's done something to help me.\" She smiled. \"That's good. I've been working on this case, y'know, getting interviews, gathering info, looking for clues. And I wanted to talk to you.\" Lamar's relaxed face changed, it grew to something worried, \"But, you quit, Diana. It's not allowed for you to do something like that.\" \"Yes it is. When your best friend has been set up I say it's alright.\" \"Look, I know your good friends with John, and I am myself, but sometimes we can't do anything about the future.\" She frowned at him. \"That's where you're wrong, Lamar. I can prove that John is innocent. All we gotta do is keep him away from Leo Crow until time runs out.\" \"How do you expect to do that?\" \"I've been helping John. Giving him tips, where he should run, where the precops are going. I can tell him to stay away.\" Lamar was silent. \"We both believe John was set up, right?\" He nodded. For some reason small beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. \"Well, through my research I've discovered something.\" Diana noticed Lamar reaching for something in his pocket. His breathing grew unsteady. \"It's not…\"—There was a sudden pain in her head; she grasped it, her hands beginning to shake—\"Witwer…\" Lamar took his hand off his gun. He reached out and held her arm. \"You okay?\" She nodded as her body stilled and she looked at him untrustingly, her aqua eyes turned icy, \"What's happened to you?\" He looked at her shocked, \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about the way you're acting. I'm just coming here to give you a report and to interview you and you're acting like I've come here to arrest you! Now really, we're on the same sides, right?\" \"Yes,\" he agreed rather weakly and sat back down. \"Well, when this prevision first showed up you were protecting John, now you're saying for this murder to take its course. What's up with that?\" \"I believed John was innocent at first but, can we let our emotions affect our judgment and let a future-murderer run free on the streets?\" \"John is not a murderer. I won't bother to ask what makes you think he is, because I don't care. What I think though, is that this doesn't have anything to do with John. It has to do with another case.\" Lamar's heart was racing. He couldn't reach for his gun now though; she already was loosing her trust in him. He would have to wait. Send someone else tonight to get it over with. \"The Anne Lively case. Ever heard of it?\" \"No. Not really.\" \"It was one of the very first cases for Precrime. It jump started our career. You wouldn't happen to know who Anne Lively is would you?\" Lamar nervously shook his head. \"She was Agatha's mother. Wonder why she was murder, huh?\" \"Yeah, it doesn't really make sense.\" Diana began to stand up, \"If I were you, I'd check it out. See if you notice anything.\" Lamar stood up and nodded, \"Sure. Tomorrow I'll make sure to run a check on the drowning of a woman named Anne Lively. Don't get you're hopes up though.\" \"Ok, bye,\" Diana replied as she walked out the door. She didn't bother to mention anything about Lamar's mistake. She was satisfied. For her, the mystery was solved. ------------- Randal Tauber walked silently down the slums of D.C. He was bald and noticeable blonde whiskers were on his face. But despite his muscular build he had a slim face, and was starving. About a week ago he was kicked out of his job and thrown out into the streets. He lost all his money to way too many beers. His life was terrible. Luckily, it was spring, and at least it wasn't freezing cold outside for him to be miserable. He glanced up at the stars with his deep green eyes. Tired, he sat down and leaned his back against a brick wall. Then, Randal reached into his worn olive jacket and pulled out an inhaler. Placing it to his mouth he took a deep breath and let the drug enter his system and run through his body. The ecstasy of the drug moved his spirits and he hit an emotional high as he rested his head against the building looking up at the sky and rapidly breathing in and out. A dumb smile spread across his thin lips exposing his yellow tinted teeth. And a small chuckle came out of him. \"You look like a decent man,\" Randal heard a voice say. He breathlessly looked over, his thick blonde eyebrows furrowed. The man walked forward, \"Would you be willing to do me a favor?\" Randal's mind spun and for the moment he saw two strangers standing in front of him. He unsteadily got up and felt his head hurt. \"Like what?\" he replied in a gruff voice. The man smiled slightly, \"I'd like for you to do a murder for me.\" Randal laughed and looked at him incredulously, \"Do you think I'm stupid? The DCPD of Precrime would halo me before I could even reach the victim. No way, man.\" The stranger's smile disappeared, \"I see you're a thinker. I like that. And I understand that you're going to need something a little more convincing\"—The man pulled out a card and placed it in Randal's hands—\"All you need to do is beat the precops to the murder, run to the nearest air port, buy you a ticket to, oh I don't know, Tahiti and get yourself a new ID. Maybe even new eyes while you're at it. You'll be home free, my man.\" Randal stared wide eyed at the opalescent card that had been placed in his hands. One million dollars, man! He was rich! He gave a whistle of amazement, \"You drive a hard bargain. I…how do I beat the precops to murdering the person?\" The stranger put his arm around him and smiled, \"You're a smart man\"— and even better for the job because you're high as a kite —\"I'm sure you can figure something out. After all, John Anderton has been able to hide from Precrime for two days. I'm sure you're going to do fine.\" Randal nodded as the man squeezed his shoulders. \"I'm gonna do fine,\" he repeated to himself. And after that, Tahiti . The stranger handed him the directions to the apartment and smiled patting him on the back as he walked off. \"Good luck,\" the man told him with a smile, you're going to need it . And for some reason, the man seemed to find a certain joy that Randal wasn't going to come back. One less mug in the street , he thought, no big loss . -------------- Diana winced as she tossed and turned in her sleep. She let out unsettling moans and her body shook uncontrollably. Quickly, she shot up out of bed, gasping and sweat glistening on her face. Her body relaxed and she buried her face in her hands letting her long brown hair fall all over her. She had dreamt that as she slept, someone came and killed her. It was terrible. She weakly got up out of bed and walked over to her kitchen and opened up a medicine cabinet. Reaching in she pulled out a bottle of pills. Pouring herself a glass of water she unscrewed the pill lid and took out two white oval pills. Taking a swig of water she popped one pill into her mouth. And after swallowing that one, she held another mouthful of water and placed the other one in her mouth and swallowed it. Placing her cup in the sink she then turned off the lights and began to walk over to the bed when she stopped and curiously walked up to the large window that showed the urban city that lied before her. The moonlight shone down on her and her pastel purple pajamas, which consisted of a satin noodle-strap shirt with matching pants. She left the window and crawled back into her bed hoping that she could finally go back to sleep. And at this time, Randal was just entering the bottom floor of her apartment's area. -------------- Danny Witwer took a sip of coffee as he took out the chip consisting of Leo Crow's murder and placed the chip of Anne Lively's murder in. Sitting back he placed his glasses on and watched as the images flew at him. One after the other, short and incomplete. \"Ok,\" he said to himself, \"What are you trying to tell me?\" Working on the computer Jad noticed something. He looked over towards the temple and saw Wally working intently on his computer processing the information about to be given. \"Murder…\" Agatha's face sunk slightly into the milk and then back up. Their bodies began to shake again, something so painful that Jad had to look away. Suddenly, on the screen above the tank images began to show up. \"Let's get started,\" Witwer muttered getting up and taking out the Anne Lively chip. Jad watched as the victim's ball began rolling down the glass chute, then drop to the end. The name passed by as Jad began to pick it up, shocked at what it was. His eyes grew big. Witwer waited for an answer, his back to Jad. \"Come on Jad, what's coming?\" He asked. Jad looked up at him and frowning Witwer turned around. Jad showed him the red ball. \"Red ball—It's, uh,\" he managed worriedly, \"Diana, Chief. Homicide. Killer's male, white, late 30's.\" Witwer's eyes grew big and he rushed forward and took the ball from Jad's hand. Oh God. There it read: Diana Warren. Jad watched as anger flushed in Witwer's face as the murderer ball rolled down the other chute. He quickly ran forward and picked the other ball up. Randal Tauber. \"Ok Randal,\" Witwer said, \"Let's see what you're gonna do to my girl.\" \"Uh, the location is Diana's apartment. As for the time frame,\" Jad explained, \"We're not sure yet.\" Witwer placed the balls over at the large holo screen and pulled the black gloves to scrub the images on. He faced the two screens on the wall of Pollard and James, \"Case # 1110 previsualized by the precogs and recorded on holosphere by Precrime's q-stacks. My fellow witnesses for case # 1110 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard. Are the witnesses ready to preview and validate # 1110?\" James and Pollard nodded. And with that, Witwer began to move his hands directing the images to what he wanted them to do by the sound of classical music. There was the image of Diana, sleeping peacefully. Next, was the opening of her apartment door, a figure walking in. There's a vicious dagger in his hand. Then, they watched as it both show Diana's peaceful face, followed by the angry glee of Randal's. The images flash by and soon there was Randal above Diana, the dagger suspended over her. One of the male precogs spoke out, \"You're a pretty little thing. I'd rather sleep with you than kill you but, money's money.\" And with one violent motion, the dagger plunged down into her skin. Witwer could see the agony in her face. He winched and looked away. It was too painful to watch. The stabbing continued and to end the images the bloody knife fell from the man's hands and bounced down onto the mattress. Witwer angrily began to scrub the images. \"Uh, Chief,\" Jad began, \"We got the time. Eight minutes.\" Witwer growled under his breath and cursed. \"Our main team's gone!\" he exclaimed, \"See if you can get me a back up team. At least someone to stop this!\" Jad spoke into his headset and looked over at Witwer sadly. \"No one else is working this late,\" he explained. Witwer cursed again, \"Get Fletcher and them, tell them that their search for Anderton's over and for them to get here in at latest three minutes.\" Jad looked at him worriedly, \"But—\" \"Now!\" he exclaimed. Jad quickly began to call into Evanna's ship and speak to her. -------------- Randal snuck as best he could over to Diana's bed. He became more like a shadow as he craftily moved to her bedside. She stirred a little, and Randal flinched. He wouldn't be able to do it if she woke up. Quietly, and barely even shifting the mattress, he climbed on and crawled to where he towered over her. His grasp on the dagger grew stronger. He then stared into her face as he began to prepare himself to stab her, and found she was beautiful. Man , he thought, I could just stop the murder right now and change plans to something else . Then, he remembered the million dollars that weighed down his pocket and his mind flashed to Tahiti. And there were other pretty girls out there. He raised the dagger above his head and gave a wild smile. Whispering softly, he told Diana, \"You're a pretty little thing. I'd rather sleep with you than kill you but, money's money.\" And with that, he began to bring down the dagger— —When Diana turned from her side and quickly placed a gun at his throat. The dagger stopped at mid motion. Randal's blue eyes widened to where all the white was showing and his mouth opened to form words but nothing came. She glared at him, \"I'm glad that money's more important to you cos I'd rather be stabbed than be with you.\" Randal's face grew into an expression of anger. It was mostly the drug that was affecting him to be like this. He continued to bring the dagger down when Diana pressed harder on his neck and he slightly gagged. \"You stab me and I'll blow your head clear off you shoulders,\" she told him. Randal's eyes showed no saneness anymore, and he continued the dagger in its downward motion. Diana's sure expression changed into worry and felt her eyes begin to water. This was it. The end. But it was the drug that saved her, maybe something even more than that, because as Randal brought the knife down to stab her he missed and tore her pillow. Now, it was Diana's time for her eyes to grow big. She found herself frozen with fear as Randal jerked the dagger out of the pillow uncoordinated. His nostrils flared as her rose the sharp object again and Diana began to pull the trigger of her gun when her door was completely knocked off its hinges and went flying across the room. She slightly looked over and gladly noticed it was Witwer with his agents. She never knew she could be that glad to see him. \"Diana!\" He called out looking over at her, and then he spotted Randal perched over her. She saw his thick eyebrows turn down into a frown and his face turn to a rage she had never seen before. Without thinking, Witwer charged forward and then leapt on top of Randal sending both of them off the bed. Diana worriedly sat up and looked over at them as Witwer had Randal in a pinned position, beating the living daylights out of him. \"What are you trying to do?!?\" he yelled punching him some more, \"No dipstick is gonna hurt her like that! You hear me? No one!\" Randal winced and brought his hands up pleadingly. Witwer grabbed him by his leather jacket and rose him slightly off the ground, \"Now, who sent you?\" Diana looked at her windows to see the glass shatter into a zillion pieces as her team of precops came bursting in. Knott rushed over to her, placing a hand on her shoulder, \"You ok? Witwer said you were in trouble and for us to hurry over.\" She nodded breathlessly, \"I handled the situation as well as I could until I could get some back up.\"—Knott smiled and she smiled back, not realizing how much she missed her old job—\"Who I'd really be worrying about right now is the poor guy that Danny's lighting into.\" Witwer shook Randal furiously, \"Who paid you?!?\" Randal gave a bloody smile, \"Now, now, how can I keep that a secret if I tell you?\" Witwer began to rear back to punch him again when he flinched, \"Ok, ok, I truly don't know who ordered me to kill her. He told me what to do, paid me, then left!\" Witwer began to ask another question when he felt one of his agents grab him and pull him off the beaten criminal and held him back from any other harmful intentions. Fletcher grabbed Randal and held him tightly by his wrists. Several of the other precops got out their sick sticks. \"By mandate of the District of Columbia Precrime division, I'm placing you under arrest—\" Fletcher began but Randal jerked away from him. There was a wild look in his green eyes. He slowly backed up, glancing around at everyone in the room. \"No,\" he said with an odd glee, \"you're not gonna catch me. I'm not going to get halo'd. I'm gonna run. Y'know where? Tahiti.\"—he brought out his card of money—\"Y'see that? That's one million dollars! No, I'm a free man.\" And with that, he backed up all the way to the broken windows, and backed up even more. He backed up to where there wasn't a floor anymore, and found the rush of excitement as he plunged through the sky and fell to the ground. Killing himself half-way down from a heart attack. No big loss. -------------- Witwer listened painfully as Randal screamed to his death plunging through the night sky down several stories. He hadn't wanted the man to die; he still needed information from him. Turning to his agents and precops he looked around the room and saw Diana running towards him. Shocked, he watched as she wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face into his shoulder. Cautiously, he placed his arms around her. \"Oh Danny!\" she cried, her voice muffled by his clothes. She was sure now that she loved him, and she knew as Randal had held that knife over her that all she wanted was to be with him. Witwer felt her body rise and fall rapidly, and he realized she was crying. He held her tighter, \"Shhh. Everything's going to be all right now.\" Diana took her face out from his shoulder and looked at him with bloodshot eyes. \"I'm so sorry,\" she told him teary-eyed. He frowned, \"For what?\" \"For acting the way I have been. It's just, when something like you're best friend being framed happens, you question who you've been trusting and, well, it seemed like you and John had a little competition between each other and…\" He shook his head, \"I promise you that I haven't done anything to John.\" \"I don't know what I've been thinking lately to give you the cold shoulder like that. I guess I've been trying to forget. To forget about us and just move on. But, I can't. I mean, when I saw that knife over me and knew it would be over, the first thing that ran through my mind was you. And I didn't know that you'd save me from this. After how I've been treating you…\"—She sighed heavily—\"And now I know that I want you, and I need you. I thought that I could cure my craving for drugs with coffee and other things but I've realized that I'm over drugs now.\"—She smiled and a small tear fell from her cheek and slowed down as it crawled halfway down her face—\"The truth is Danny, I'm addicted to you.\" He returned the smile and brought out his hand to wipe away the tear, letting his palm rest on her cheek for a few minutes. Then, he came forward and placed his lips on hers and kissed her. They stayed like that for awhile, and then broke apart. And as they stared into each other's eyes, they heard the sound of clapping begin to arise in her apartment followed by cheers. They looked around at the precops and the four Federal agents and smiled. Witwer brought his eyes back to hers and said, \"So, this is what your apartment looks like. She nodded then turned to see the precops boarding their ship (Including a whoop of a cheer from Knott as he exclaimed, \"Finally, we get to eat!!\") and the four agents motioning to Witwer. He began to break out of her grasp and leave when she tightened her grip on him. \"Please,\" she begged, \"Stay.\" He looked over at his agents and told them to go on without him. He then turned to her and looked over at her windows, \"After all, she needs some help with this draft in here. Can you feel that? It's terrible!\" She laughed. That was witty Witwer for you.[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect.

A so-called \"pre-crime division\" is working around Washington DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. But soon a Federal agent comes snooping around headquarters in search of flaws. Human flaws. And the main man on his list is John Anderton, a firm believer in the system, that is, before it came after him. With the help of one of his closest friends, Diana Warren, Anderton has to prove that he's innocent, even if it means that the system will be shut down. But there's a secret that's being hidden from them all, and it's right in front of them. Ch. 7: Smooth Criminal Fractured images…they swarm in and take over my brain…cruel, evil intentions of a twisted soul that have imprisoned me in this place. The time is near…oh so near. And things are becoming clear. John is beginning to understand…and even I am. My mother's murder will be revenged. I know now. An old man sits down in a chair…the Anne Lively murder is placed on the wall with a projector…Anderton's apartment…a young man stands next to the images, dark hair, dark eyes…He makes a speech to the old man, and when finished he stands straight and proudly for a moment, quiet, then begins again when— — The old man shushes him, \"You know what I hear?\" \" What?\" \" Nothing. No footsteps coming up the stairs. No hovercraft out the window. No clickity click of little spyders. No one crashing through that door. And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny? Because right now, the Precogs can't see a thing.\" Gunfire…a growing circle of red blood stains the dark haired man's shirt…The old man stands over him…another gunfire…Oh God…Danny… --------------- A smile was on Diana Warren's lips as she thought about last night while running over the clippings of all the murders that Precrime had solved in their years of existence. Thanks to Witwer, she had been able to access this room, considering she no longer had the right to walk about Precrime Headquarters like this. She had to thank Witwer for everything that he had done for her, though. And she wasn't sure that without him she could've been able to get as far as she has. Flipping the paper's corners across her thumb she read the bold print articles. Surely there was something about Anne Lively. She frowned. There was something so familiar about this murder. And she wanted to find out what it was. She knew one thing though; Lamar had something to do with it. She ran through another stack of papers that dated as far back as 2048. Suddenly, she found what she was looking for as the words appeared crossing the cover of the front page. MURDER STOPPED BEFORE IT HAPPENS!! NEW BUSINESS CALLED PRECRIME SAVES A WOMAN NAMED ANNE LIVELY. She threw down the papers and began to read the article sitting down on one of the many cardboard boxes that decorated the article room. She frowned concentrating on every detail. The importance of how Ms. Lively was never interviewed to give her opinion, and how Lamar never speaks of saving her life but merely \"helping\" her. She was interrupted in her observation though, by the sound of breaking windows (ever since last night that seemed to be something to haunt her, the sound and everything.) and some yelling by Wally. She shot up from her position and listened to hear Wally wail even more. She quickly tucked the article into her pocket and burst out the door of the small area and ran down the clear halls towards the Analytical Room. ------------- Danny Witwer began his daily routine at Precrime Headquarters by once again studying Leo Crow's murder. Crow's cries seemed to echo across the building as he ran through each image. But as he studied the murder something appeared that he hadn't noticed before. He turned to Fletcher, \"Fletcher, take a look.\" Turning around the muscular blonde got up from his chair and moved over to the screen. \"There's four people in this room, not three,\" Witwer informed. \"Four?\" Fletcher questioned, \"There's Anderton, there's Crow, and there's the man with sunglasses.\" \"There's the man with sunglasses outside the window,\" Witwer brought the image of the man forward the moved it away with a swipe of his hand then brought up another image, \"There's also, someone here…in the mirror.\" He enhances the image. \"Yeah. It's definitely female.\" Witwer, frowning with concentration, ran through the images again, trying to find a better view. Then, he noticed another image, and zoomed up on it. It was a clearer picture of the girl. Her body was pale and for the most part she was bald. \"What does that look like to you?\" he asked Fletcher. \"I don't know.\" \"It's Agatha. He's coming here to get her.\" Witwer took the image off the screen and turned to find the black woman who didn't want him in Anderton's seat right behind him. She was slightly smiling as he walked off. -------------- Diana rushed up the ramp to the Analytical Room and saw through the glass a group of people. Great , she thought annoyingly, what's going on now ? Opening the door she pushed through the crowds of people to where she had a good view of the Temple. She then noticed the broken window and Anderton's rolling chair on the other side. Not to mention the milk-less, and Agatha-less, tank. There was a pain in her head as she stared at Witwer chasing Wally and then she noticed how Arthur and Dashiell's mindless blue eyes stared straight at her. She winced. \"What does he want with a Precog?\" Witwer asked yelling over Wally's frantic sobs. \"What do you think?\" Wally cried running around the tank hoping that for some reason Agatha might pop up, \"So he can kill anyone he wants to without anyone knowing about it!\" \"But there's still the other two!\"—Witwer paused—\"Wally?\" Wally didn't listen. His mind spun with worries about poor Agatha. Eventually, him and Witwer ran into each other. \"Wally!\" Witwer grabbed the man by his arms, \"the other two can still function, right?\" \"You don't understand!\" Wally sobbed, \"They're a hive mind! It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.\" \"Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?\" \"Maybe if he'd taken one of the males. But Agatha, she's the key. She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent. She takes care of the other two.\" \"Jesus…Agatha.\" As Witwer began to walk over to Fletcher Wally clung onto his back and grabbed his shirt begging, \"Please bring her back.\" \"Find out where that pipe leads! I want every team underground now!\" Fletcher barked out to the gaping Precops. \"It doesn't matter,\" Witwer told him, \"He wins.\" \"I'll send my men in Evac. We'll stop him in the reservoir.\" Fletcher turned back to the Precops to give another order when Witwer stopped him. \"Gordon! She's in the room with him when he kills Crow. She's already a part of his future.\"—Witwer continued to walk towards the Analytical room and looked up at Jad—\"Jad, put everything you've got into finding that room and we stop a murder.\"—he turned back to Fletcher—\"How much time we got, Gordon?\" \"We've got: Fifty-one minutes, thirty seconds.\" Witwer turned and walked out of the temple, he winced with aggravation. Diana hurried over to him, \"What happened?\" He looked over at her, \"You're little 'friend' just stole Agatha.\" As he continued past Diana her face grew in shock as she realized something, \"The Minority Report…that means he's gonna—\" She stopped herself. Once Anderton got the Minority Report she knew what he'd go after next…Agatha's sister. And she didn't want Witwer to know about that. She probably shouldn't have even mentioned the Minority Report at all while in his presence. Witwer stopped and slowly turned around. He frowned at her, \"What did you say?\" Diana's eyes fell to the ground and she found herself worried that Witwer might actually get Anderton halo'd because of her, \"A Minority Report. It's when…it's when the Precogs disagree on something. One might see the vision differently than the other which means that that person might actually have an alternate future. That's what Anderton wants to find out.\" Witwer's eyes grew big, \"My God…so is this why you stood up for John? Because you knew he might have an alternate future?\"—he glanced down slightly and licked his lips then looked back up at her—\"Why didn't you tell me about this?\" Diana tried to find the words to explain but she couldn't. She would have to tell Witwer about her past, and she didn't want to think about that. She could barely remember herself how she knew what a Minority Report was. \"Diana,\" Witwer walked forward and placed his hands on her shoulders. She could feel her heart skip a beat as he looked into her sky blue eyes, \"Where would Anderton go if he wanted to see Agatha's vision of his murder?\" Diana glared, \"I won't tell. You'll halo him anyway.\" \"Please, Diana! Just—\" She shook her head. Witwer smiled and slightly chuckled, \"You've got a lot of loyalty to not give Anderton away. Not even to your boyfriend. I just hope if I ever get framed for something you'll stand up for me just as well as you do him.\" She smiled also as he walked off to tell Fletcher and the rest of his team his new found information. As for Diana, she began to walk out of the Headquarters, soon to begin her search for Anderton. What she didn't know as she walked down the glass ramp to the elevator, was that this might be her last time to see Witwer. Alive, that is. ---------------- The music pounded in Anderton's head as Rufus Riley hooked Agatha up with wires to hack into her previsions at his business: Rufus' Dreamweaver Headspa. Agatha moaned nervously as she lied in the chair. Anderton bent down to get eye level with her and said soothingly, \"Agatha, I need to see. I need to see what's going to happen to me. And then we'll go.\" She smiled at him dazedly as Rufus, a man that seemed to continue with the old style of the hippies, made the final touchs on the thousands of wires that stuck to her head. She jerked and let out a small gasp as the images of all her past murders poured out. Anderton turned around. \"Wow,\" Rufus said shocked, \"she works.\" \"Slow it down,\" Anderton commanded. Rufus turned back to Agatha, \"How do I slow this down? Should I hit her on the head?\" The Precog's body twitched and squirmed as Anderton watched his future murder. Anderton turned back to Rufus, \"Are you recording this?\" Rufus looked at him in shock and ran over to his key board, \"Shoot!\"—then, pressing a button he looked up at John—\"Yeah, recording.\" Anderton walked towards the screen as the familiar images poured out, waiting for something different to happen. \"I know this already,\" he seemed to say to Agatha, \"Come on, move on.\" \"Good-bye Crow,\" Agatha called out saying the words the images would say. And with that, the Anderton on the screen shot the man named Leo Crow. The screen then grew blank. Anderton's eyes grew in shock. \"What happened?\" he asked turning to Rufus. \"I dunno,\" he replied. Anderton repeated himself, this time a little more irritable, \"What happened?\" \"I…I…I gu—\" Rufus tried to say. \"Well where's the rest of it?!?\" \"I guess that's all of it!\" Anderton turned to Agatha and dove on top of her. He leaned close to her face and stared into her lifeless blue eyes, \"Where's my…Minority…Report?\" Agatha looked at him blankly. Anderton could feel his patience failing. \"DO I EVEN HAVE ONE?!?\" He yelled then repeated softer, \"Do I have one?\" \"No,\" Agatha replied. \"What?\" He was shocked. \"No.\" Anderton slowly got off her and just as he did she sat straight up as another prevision came and she gasped, several small screams escaping her lips. \"Agatha?\" Anderton frowned. She turned and grabbed him, moaning painfully, \"Can you see?\" \"See what?\" She let out another cry and bent backwards where she was seeing the screen upside down. Anderton looked up to what was showing. \"Anne Lively,\" He muttered, \"You want me to see who killed Anne Lively?\"—he was silent for a moment, thinking everything over—\"That's why I need to speak to your sister…she knows…\" ----------------- Anderton drug Agatha along beside him down one of Washington's dark alley ways. The echoing sound of rain pounding down could be heard beyond the shelter of the roofs to many of the buildings. She moaned. \"Come on!\" Anderton told her and looked down at her as she clung to him, \"I'm tired of guessing where she might be! Agatha,\"—He turned her head to look at him—\"just tell me, where is your sister?\" \"My sister,\" she replied, \"is dead.\" Anderton shook his head, \"She' can't be dead!! Dr. Hineman said for me to find her!\" \"She's dead… she's dead …\" He shushed her. There was something in the shadows; at least, he thought there was. Agatha breathlessly looked around. Silence, nothing but the rain. Then, her blue lifeless eyes peered into his, \"And you will be too, John. If you don't move.\" Anderton frowned and before he even realized it there was the sound of someone being shot. Turning to the brick wall he saw a rugged looking man fall to the ground out of the shadows. Anderton looked around to try and find the shooter, but saw nothing. There was a cock of the gun again, but Anderton didn't know where to run. \"John Anderton?\" The voice came from the corner of one building. Anderton was about to reply when he realized that he shouldn't. The shooter walked out, and Anderton saw it was a woman. Her hair was short and a dark blonde, her eyes, like Agatha's, were a cold blue. Anderton frowned, \"How do you know my name?\" The woman seemed a little hesitant at answering, \"I…I saw you…\" \"What?\" \"In the vision I had. That man, he was going to kill you.\" \"What's your name?\" \"Karen Lively.\" Bingo , Anderton thought. Karen gave a frown as she saw the pale and thin being clasping to Anderton's body. She took a small step forward, and immediately Agatha took a quick step back, bringing Anderton with her. And in that moment, Anderton thought he heard a small whimper come from Agatha's lips. \"Mm…my sister is dead ,\" she said quietly under her breath. Karen continued to move forward and with a tinge of sorrow she asked, \"Agatha? Is that you?\" Anderton didn't understand why Agatha seemed fearful of Karen, but decide not to let her get any closer. \"Stop,\" he told her, his dark brown eyes telling her not to pull any tricks, \"I don't want to upset her.\" The Precog nuzzled him, whispering something in his ear. Karen gave a look of shock at this rudeness, and said indignantly, \"Stop? I haven't seen my sister in years and you tell me to stop?\" Anderton glanced down at his watch as she spoke to him, and quickly glanced up. \"Mind if we walk while we talk?\" he asked while pulling out his black umbrella. ------------- \"So exactly,\" Karen began frowning at Anderton as they pushed through the crowd on the sidewalk, \"why do you want to know about me as a child? Why, in fact, do I even have to come with you?\" Anderton glanced back at her, her clothes and hair plastered to her face by the rain, the questions not exactly registering in his mind like they should have. \"Your mother's murder ties in with me being framed.\" She nodded her head slightly, her mind churning, showing she was understanding everything now, \"Well, as you know, my mother was murdered—\" Anderton stopped amongst the crowds and turned to her showing that as his time dwindled out, so had begun his patience. \"It's not what I know I want to hear about!\" he told her angrily as she cowered down slightly, \"Tell me what I don't know!\" Karen's face showed nothing but a blank look as her friendliness towards Anderton shattered. She knew all that was going to happen to him, so why was he being so mean to her? All she had to do was walk off, and leave him lost in the truth. After all, she didn't even make Anderton have to pay her for her predictions! \"Tell me who murdered your mother!\" he demanded. The shyness Anderton saw when he first had met Karen began to shine through again, \"I…I…I don't know.\" Anderton's eyes grew big and she saw he was fighting to hurt her right then and there. \"You don't know?\" He asked her under his breath, trying to sound calm. \"No! I don't! He was wearing a mask for God's sake!\" Anderton rolled his eyes wondering why he was going through this. A chuckle slowly came out of him. He just found it so funny how things had built up, and now they're falling to pieces. Maybe he should just run over to Precrime headquarters and tell Witwer to lock him up and throw away the key! Glancing over at Karen as his chuckle subsided; she was staring at something. Following her eyes to that direction, he saw what she was looking at. \"That's the guy,\" Anderton said with slight amazement, \"The man in the window.\" He watched as the billboard for Rēvo slowly escalated to the sky. He looked down at his watch. THIRTEEN MINUTES. Grabbing her arm they rushed into the hotel closest to the rising billboard. -------------- Danny Witwer stared at Rufus's equipment he had used to probe Agatha's mind. He was beginning to feel impatient, knowing they were just wasting time in this silence of inspection. His fellow agents, spread across the room, occasionally glanced back at him, hoping he'd find what he was looking for. Because in all honestly, as they stood there observing bits and pieces of mechanical technology and giving a \"hmm\" every now and then, they had no clue what they were doing. Witwer glanced up at Rufus taking his eyes off the computer screen. \"What was he looking for?\" Rufus's eyes grew big as he tried to come up with an explanation, a diversion to keep the savvy secret agent's hands off his friend. \"Well, um. I didn't understand it exactly…\" Clicking a small button Witwer brought the image of Leo Crow's murder up on the screen and glanced back at Rufus, \"Something like this?\" Rufus looked at Witwer in shock, unsure how he figured out how his equipment worked. \"Well, yeah, I guess.\" He replied shrugging. \"Well,\" Witwer said to himself with a smug smile, slowly turning back to the screen, \"John Anderton, let's see if you even have a Minority—\" His smile faded as his eye came back up on the screen. His four agents all turned away from their inspections and mystified, watched the images as they poured out. Witwer's mouth hung slightly open as he watched Anne Lively's murder. Recognizing it from the first night he had come here. Not even bothering to turn his head away from the screen he asked, \"This is what he wanted to see?\" \"No…\" Rufus told him slightly confused with his interest, \"This is what she wanted him to see.\" The murder quickly ended, abruptly going black. Witwer turned to him, \"I'll need a copy of this.\" ------------- \"Hey,\" Anderton began waiting patiently at the registration booth in the hotel. The clerk seemed to ignore him though. His eyes focused on the cash register, a slight smile on his face. \"Hey!\" Anderton repeated. The clerk's tattooed face turned towards him expressing no emotion. \"Rooms are ninety-five plus tax,\" he told him rather annoyed. Karen glanced over at Anderton as she watched him spin the register in his direction. \"You mind if I take a look at your register?\" Anderton asked. The clerk quickly turned it back to face him. \"Yeah, I mind.\" And with that, Anderton quickly pulled out his .45 revolver spinning it on the table where the barrel pointed towards him. \"How 'bout now?\" \"Help yourself,\" he told him, quickly spinning around the register. Anderton flipped away from the video of a girl stripping on to the registration chart, giving information on all that are staying in the hotel at this moment. And then, his finger stopped on an L.F. Crow. He frowned, looking at the picture, looking at the man he was about to murder. \"He's here,\" Anderton clarified, not exactly speaking to anyone in particular. Karen frowned herself, \"John, you say you're not going to murder him but, why don't you just end it here? Leave and forget about Leo Crow.\" \"I have to know,\" was all of his reply as he began to help Agatha up as she stumbled. She looked up at him, her blank expression staring through him, \"Anderton, leave.\" The Precog seemed to be in a distant state of mind, her eyes not exactly focusing on anything. He wrapped his arms around her stabling her. \"You have a choice,\" she told him weakly, \"Walk away. Do it now.\" \"I can't,\" Anderton repeated, \"I have to know. I have to find out what happened to my life.\" \"Please—\" \"Agatha, I'm not going to kill the man. I don't even know him.\" \"Yes but,\" Karen interrupted, \"You don't always have to know someone to want to kill them. This Leo Crow, I feel, is someone you've wanted to lay your hands on for a long time.\" Anderton turned to her, his eyebrows furrowed, \"Look, I'm going to figure this out and that's that. Fate is not our destiny if we know that we can change it. Look at the system!\" \"The system is a failure, John!!\" Karen continued, her voice becoming weary, \"Can't you see? Its failure was its success.\" Anderton ignored her comment, what was she talking about? He turned to the clerk, \"What room is Crow in?\" \"Ten-o-six.\" \"Come on,\" Anderton told Agatha gently, then repeated glancing over at Karen, \"Come on.\" Agatha, followed by Karen, stared worriedly at the ex-Precop. Anderton looked at their expression, their emotionless icy blue eyes staring right at him, and looked away. He looked right over at the lounge area of the hotel, just to see an old woman smoking on her pipe, a deep chuckle rumbling in her throat. -------------- The three of them, Karen, Agatha, and Anderton, cautiously walked up to the door of room 1006, afraid of what existed behind the door. Was Leo Crow really that dangerous? None of them were sure, but none wanted to figure it out by the sound of gunshot. It seemed almost haunting the way the dull green door slowly came closer to reach, standing on the blood red carpet. Anderton's hand reached out, formed in a fist, knocked twice on the door, then gently turned the handle. It was almost complete silence as the door creaked ajar. Anderton glanced at his watch. FIVE MINUTES. Placing Agatha next to the wall, he pushed the door completely open, then turned to Karen signaling to stay where she was. She nodded. And with that, he stepped in. It seemed like too much silence, too quiet. And Anderton was afraid of that. But truly, there was nothing to fear. The room was clean, as if no one had slept in it, stayed in it at all. He hurried and checked the bathroom, expecting to see accessories, but it was empty. It was all empty. \"John,\" Karen's voice broke the silence making him slightly jump. He walked over to her as she stared at the numbers on the door. Then raising up her hand, she twisted the six on the gold plated 1006, turning it to a nine. She gave a crooked smile, \"Wrong room.\" Anderton frowned and looked down across the hall, and saw room 1006 in all its mystery. Walking over to it he cautiously checked the numbers, making sure there were no more tricks, and found the six was glued in tightly. With that, he kicked open the door, bursting into the room. And saw what he wanted to see. Rushing over he grabbed Agatha pulling her to the room with him. As they walked in, Karen quietly shut the door behind her and looked around the room. Someone definitely lived here. Clothes were askew along with an unfinished meal which Anderton avoided. Setting Agatha down she looked up at him in fear, \"Leave…leave!!\" Anderton knew she didn't want the murder to take place, but he knew even more that he had to find out what he had to do with Leo Crow. As he stood up, he walked over to a black brief case that sat on a glass table. Figuring it would conceal the evidence he needed, he opened it up. Only to find it was merely dark clothes. Throwing the clothes back into the brief case his eyes looked across the room. And that's when he saw it, the unmade bed covered with thousands of pictures. He stood over the bed as what seemed minutes hung in the air, shocked and confused with the photos of so many children. His eyes crossed over each child, some posing for the picture and others completely oblivious of their image being taken, when he saw the tip of a certain photo. \"Anderton?\" Karen interrupted, \"Let's just leave. You don't have to go through with this.\" Anderton ignored her. His hand reached forward and suddenly, without even picking up the picture he knew why he was pursuing Crow. It was because of the fear that had hung onto him. He had known what this was all about from the very beginning, but didn't want to accept it. Slowly, he raised the photo into sight. \"Oh God,\" his eyes widened at the impact of the picture, \"Sean…my son.\" It was a small photo booth picture, one his son didn't look very happy in. Both Agatha and Karen frowned at him. \"Everyday,\" he told them, his eyes not leaving the photo, \"for the last six years I've only thought about two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street. The second was what I would do to the man who took him.\"—he paused, knowing he should've listened to the two Precogs and gave a small chuckle—\"You're right. I'm not being set up.\" Agatha's gasps for breaths grew stronger as she felt the fear, the death, creeping closer into the room. She could even almost feel the cold clutch of death's icy fingers wrapping themselves around Anderton. With great effort she attempted crawling onto the bed, \"You have to take me home.\" Karen took a step forward also. \"Yes, let's leave and take my sister home.\" Anderton wasn't listening, painful thoughts swamped his mind impairing his hearing, and all he heard was the beating of his own heart. Looking through the pictures he pulled out another shot of Sean. This one a group of them, including Crow. \"You said so yourself,\" Anderton told Agatha as she crawled over to him, \"There is no Minority Report. I don't have an alternative future.\" A small smile of the inevitable came across Anderton's face which Karen was never quite sure of being anger or joy, \"I am going to kill this man.\" Agatha grabbed his hand and looked up at him with desperation, \"You still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did.\" And as Agatha said this, a fear came over Karen, and she knew that Crow was behind her. So silent and quite, Karen couldn't believe there was a pause as the man saw strangers in his room. \"Who are you?\" Crow asked. Anderton looked up at him with anger and she quickly jumped out of the way as Anderton rushed over to the man. A long and painful scream erupted in Agatha as Karen fell back against the wall in fear, watching as Anderton grabbed Crow and threw him onto the bed. \"Six years ago, Baltimore, you grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.\" Anderton's words were almost drowned out by Agatha's screams, and to Karen's surprise she suddenly realized that her own screams were leaking out. \"Did I?\" Crow asked, \"I don't remember anything about that place—\" Anderton picked Crow up from the bed and slung him into the mirror which shattered letting pieces of gleaming light fall to the ground. \"Who am I?\" Anderton demanded, \" Who am I? You know who I am!!!\" \"You're…you're somebody's father.\" \"His name is Sean!!\" And as Anderton told him this, he slung him into the table with the brief case sending all that was on it, along with the table, to the ground. \"I told him I was a policeman. I…I told him,\" Crow tried to get out through the punches that came at him constantly, \"I needed his help. It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song! I bough him a pretzel! I bought him a pretzel! He was happy! He was happy!\" Anderton's hand tightened on Crow's throat as an excited fear came to his stomach. He looked at the man and ceased from his attacks, \"Is he alive? He's alive!\" Crow is silent. Anderton shook him hoping somehow it would bring answers. \"Where've you got him? Is he alright?\" Anderton shook him harder, \"Tell me!!! Where is he!?\" Crow looked at him in fear, his words coming in raspy from the slight closing of his esophagus. \"I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay…it floated back up and I took him out…I was gentle…I was gentle…\" There was a pause as Crow tried to take in more air, his heart pounding a million times faster than normal, and he repeated once again in a quieter voice, \"…I was gentle…\" Anderton let up on the man's throat and with that Crow gave a gasp of relief. Rolling back to where his back leaned up against the bed, Anderton stared at Crow with a look of horror and sadness at such a twisted mind. \"I'm sorry…\" Crow told him breathlessly, \"I'm sorry…I'm so sorry.\" Anderton's face grimaced, as what Karen thought first. But she then realized it was no chuckle of anger, a grimace of pain…Anderton, the big bad Precop, was crying. \"How could you do that to my boy?\" Anderton questioned through his tears, and with that, kicked Crow in the stomach sending him on his back. Then he was on Leo Crow again, punching, kicking, beating the man at each sound of his helpless cries. And then, Anderton stood up letting Crow back away and get up himself. Anderton glared at the murderer, knowing that his fate, as he stood in front of that giant glass window, was going to be a lot worse than he may have predicted for doing that to his son. He quickly pulled out his .45, pointing it at Crow. His breath unsteady with anger. Anderton's eyes glanced over at the slowly rising Rēvo billboard, everything was true…there was never a flaw in the system…his watch slowly counted down the few seconds of Crow's life. Eleven…ten…nine…eight… Agatha watched Anderton battle between what his heart wanted and his mind wanted. \"You can choose,\" she said quietly, \"You can choose…\" Five…four…Crow's face tightened and he closed his eyes, waiting for the bullet…three…two…one. Beep! Beep! Beep! Silence. All except for Anderton's watch. His face calmed, even though inside he was shocked at what he had done, at what he had not done. His breath remained unsteady, the pain, the fear, the anger all surfacing. And tears began to swell up in his eyes although he tried to hold it back. No gunshot was ever fired. Crow looked at Anderton shocked also. Why was he alive? Anderton was supposed to kill him!! \"You have the right to remain silent,\" Anderton whispered through the lump in his throat, \"Anything you say or do can be used against you in court of law.\"—Anderton sniffed, he couldn't believe what he was doing—\"You have the right to an attorney present now and during future questioning. If you cannot afford one, we will appoint you one. Do you understand these rights?\" Crow looked at him incredulously, \"You're not going to kill me?\" Anderton slowly lowered the gun, knowing what he had chosen was right. \"Do you understand these rights?\" \"You're not going to kill me? If you don't go through with this my family gets nothing! Okay? You're supposed to kill me!! He said you would.\" Anderton frowned, \"'He'? Who's 'he'?\" \"I dunno. He called me in my cell, told me I'd be released if I went along, and my family'd be taken care of.\" \"If you did what? If you did what? \" \"If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?\" \"If you killed my kid?\" \"Look, if you don't kill me my family gets nothing. Okay?\" \"What about the pictures?\" \"They're fake. He gave 'em to me. Okay?\" \"Now listen to me. Y-you tell me, who was it set this up?\" \"I don't know. Come on!\" Anderton's voice was quiet and remained calm as he walked up to Leo, \"Who was it who put you up to this?\" \"I didn't see his face! I tell you who it was and my family gets nothing!\" \"Tell me, who made you do this?\" Agatha gave a moan as Leo reached forward pulling the gun barrel to his stomach. \"Kill me! Do this . Kill me!\" \"Tell me.\" And strangely, all of a sudden, Anderton's cell phone rang. He looked up at Leo. \"Leo, let go of the gun.\" \"Kill me!\" The phone continued the ringing, bringing noise into the sober atmosphere. \"Let go of the gun, its okay.\" Leo's hands loosened on the barrel. \"Let go of the gun. That's it. Let go of the gun.\" This time, Leo's hands moved from the barrel completely and without taking his eyes off him, Anderton reached for his phone. Flipping open the cover he saw Diana's face come over the holo-screen. \"John!\" She cried, \"Tell me, please, tell me. Is it over?\" John looked at her pleading face and she saw he had been crying. He nodded, \"It's over.\" \"And Crow?\" \"Crow's alive.\" Diana gave what seemed like a smile, \"Good. I knew…\"—He words trailed off for a moment and she paused, the smile fading and glancing down. She looked back up at him and regained the smile—\"…you wouldn't do it.\" Anderton frowned. \"What's happened?\" Diana was silent. She could end the conversation right now, just hang up. But she didn't, and she knew she wouldn't. Anderton needed to know. \"It's coming back.\" Anderton frowned, \"What? Who—\" \"Everything! It's all coming back. I can see it now, what happened. I can't believe it…\" \"Diana—you're not making any sense—\" \"Oh, but for the first time in my life I am, John. I couldn't understand it before, I didn't understand myself before now…But I know. I know who set you up, I know everything.\" \"What?—\" \"My name isn't Diana Warren, John. I can remember it all now, I see it!! I was home alone that day…oh God…do you know how this feels!\" \"Well then, who are you Diana?\" \"I thought you'd have figured it out, John. You're a smart man.\" Anderton's eyes grew big and all of a sudden he knew. \"I'm Agatha's sister. Those shakes I've been having, it's not from my cravings of drugs, I'm seeing what Agatha's seeing. What Arthur and Dashiell are seeing. Can you see John? Can you see?\" Anderton's mind flashed to Karen, and anger rose. \"Oh God…Why didn't you tell me this before?\" \"You're not going to kill me…\" Leo said over their conversation, thinking out loud. \"I was afraid John! After all these years I finally know my past! Why my mother died and how…and I know who I am John. Abigail Lively.\" \"Then tell me! Who set this up? Who put Crow up to this?\" The screen began to shake, and Anderton saw snow begin to appear across the screen. Then, Diana's face disappeared, and all he saw was snow and the crackle of a lost connection. But she was still there, on the other end. He heard her mutter something, something like, \"Danny…\" and the screen cleared up for a moment, just in time for him to see she had dropped the phone, and her run off in the distance. Anderton stared at the phone, letting the noise continue for a moment. How did he miss it? So much information ran through his head he almost felt like it was going to burst. Diana? A Precog? And what happened? Did she see something that was going to happen? He had to find her, and the only way of doing that was to leave here. Crow repeated his words, \"You're not going to kill me…\" Anderton hung up and placing the phone in his pocket shook his head, \"Good-bye Crow.\" And as he turned Leo dove for the gun, grabbing the barrel. \"Anderton wait a second!\" Agatha gave a blood curdling scream as gunfire went off, sending Leo backwards into the window. Then, with the crash of breaking glass, Leo continued his fall backwards, all the way down several stories. Anderton couldn't believe it. What had happened? Was it him who pulled the trigger? Did he actually do it or was it suicide? He stepped forward through the gun smoke and looked down at the body as sounds from people all over rose from the shock of the dead man's fall. Stunned Anderton turned away from the window, and began to walk to the door. \"John!\" Karen rushed over to him and grabbed his arm, \"I can explain!\" Anderton looked over at her and seemed to look right past her, jerking his arm out of her grip. He then walked over and grabbed Agatha. And once having her, he began to move back over to the door. Karen stopped him in his path and gave a look of pain, \"I'm sorry I tricked you, John but you have to understand! I was low on money, and I knew you were innocent—\" Anderton gave a slight smile, \"Cosmic Karen, from Cosmic Karen's Hotline, right? You're one of those people who steal others money by lying to them. You're really good at that you know.\" Anderton was right at the door now and he saw Karen's eyes watered. \"I didn't see it until now,\" he continued, \"I guess with my thoughts only on myself, Crow, and who set me up that I wasn't exactly paying attention to everything. But now I understand. You found me there in that alley way, and shot hearing Agatha's comment. After that you lied in that believable way you can, and now you're here.\" He opened the door and began to walk out when she followed him. He turned and looked her in the eyes, only then did she see the anger that was in him. \"And you're not going to leave from here either. Not with me anyway.\" And with that he slammed the door in her face, not exactly caring what she thought about him. That was the last Anderton ever saw of Cosmic Karen Owens.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect.

A so-called \"pre-crime division\" is working around Washington DC. Its purpose is to use the precog(nitive) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. But soon a Federal agent comes snooping around headquarters in search of flaws. Human flaws. And the main man on his list is John Anderton, a firm believer in the system, that is, before it came after him. With the help of one of his closest friends, Diana Warren, Anderton has to prove that he's innocent, even if it means that the system will be shut down. But there's a secret that's being hidden from them all, and it's right in front of them. Ch. 8: Who Framed John Anderton? \"Doesn't make sense,\" Danny Witwer stared at the tons of Polaroid evidence that lay on the bed, \"If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them on the bed for anyone to find?\" Fletcher thought of the precognition as he let his chin rest between his thumb and index finger, \"They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.\" Witwer turned to him, a picture of Crow and Sean in his hand, and stared at him through his glasses, \"What kind of cop were you before this?\" \"Treasury agent. Eight years.\" \"This would be your first actual murder scene.\" \"Yea.\" \"I worked homicide before I went federal.\"—Witwer laid the photo booth pictures down onto the bed—\"This is what we call an 'orgy of evidence'.\" Witwer took off his glasses and glanced over at the young woman who sat sullen in the far corner of the room. He saw the anger in her, the way her eyes wouldn't meet the gaze of her interrogator, agent Price. She hadn't spoken in the whole amount of time they had been there. In a way, that's what had frightened him the most, unaware of what malevolent thoughts might be running through her mind. But Witwer understood now that there was something more than what was in the precognition. Otherwise, why would Cosmic Karen be getting interrogated when she was never in the prediction? His eyes went back to Fletcher. \"Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide cop, Gordon?\" \"How many?\" \"None.\" Placing his glasses in the breast pocket of his shirt Witwer moved over to the .45 caliber revolver and squatted down inspecting it where it laid. His eyes then moved to the broken window in front of him, and then to Fletcher again. \"This was all arranged.\" -------------- \"Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Precrime experiment…\" Lamar Burgess stared with undivided attention at the TV as Leo Crow's murder broadcasted on CNN. His face appeared haggard, he couldn't understand how it had happened; things were suppose to have all worked out. Over the noise of the television the phone rang. \"Sadly enough this failure was human.\"— Ring! —\"The Protection team simply didn't get there in time to stop the murder. But the murder happened exactly as the Precogs had predicted it would.\" Celeste slowly walked up to her husband, and Lamar suddenly realized the phone had stopped ringing. \"I think today's event put a human face on the Precrime system.\" The TV continued. Celeste stopped in front of him, \"Danny Witwer's on the phone. He says it's important.\" Lamar didn't move. He didn't even acknowledge his wife's presence. He just couldn't believe it…he couldn't understand it…what had gone wrong? He glanced away down to the ground, silently telling his wife he didn't want to take any calls. Celeste looked at her husband sympathetically and sat down in a chair diagonal from him. \"Lamar?\" The TV continued its drone in the background. \"Precrime has still successfully intervened in hundreds of homicides…\" Lamar took the phone out of his wife's hands and placed it on his ears. \"What?\" he asked. \"Lamar,\" Witwer's voice came through worriedly, \"there's something wrong. We're chasing the wrong man.\" The president of Precrime placed his hand on his wife's, somehow hoping her touch could calm him. \"What?\" \"I don't wanna say over the phone. Meet me at Anderton's.\" And quickly, Witwer hung up. Lamar glanced over at his wife, confused and worried over what Witwer had discovered. ------------- Diana looked up at the hotel in which Crow was once staying at. There was still a fairly large amount of people among the scene of Crow's abrupt stop into the concrete. Luckily however, Crow had already been cleaned up and placed in the Dispenser leaving only a large stain of blood in his remembrance. The crew for CNN had already invaded the area, wanting questions in which the Precops would ignore. Diana quickly crawled under the yellow restriction tape blocking off the rest of the civilians. \"Hey there! You! Stop!\" Diana recognized the voice and turned around. The Precop rushed up to her and she smiled. \"Hello Jeff.\" He looked at her nervously and said, \"Diana? What are you doing here?\" \"I need to speak with Danny.\" \"I'm sorry but you know the rules, no one without a badge can enter.\" Diana glared at him, \"I think both you and I know nobody ever follows the rules anymore.\" And with that, she pushed past him. \"Diana, wait!\" Knott called after her but it was too late, she had already walked into the hotel. He finished his sentence, quieting his voice knowing she wouldn't hear him anyway. \"Witwer left five minutes ago.\" -------------- Diana burst through Crow's apartment door and watched as every cop and agent turned their heads staring in shock at her appearance. \"Danny?\" she called out. Fletcher frowned, \"Diana? What—\" She interrupted him quickly walking over, \"Where's Danny? I need to speak to him.\" \"You, uh, you just missed him. Why?\" Her blue eyes grew big, \"What?! Where'd he go?\" \"Calm down. It's not like he's dying.\" Diana glanced down, the images flooding her brain and muttered, \"You'd be surprised actually.\" \"What was that?\" \"Nothing…Did Danny go to John's apartment?\" \"Well yeah, but…how'd you know?\" Upon hearing this, Diana quickly turned around and began to run out the door. She glanced back and called out to Fletcher, \"Sorry Gordon, I got to go!\" Fletcher watched as she disappeared from sight, a deep frown on his face. Boy , he thought, was that weird . -------------- Witwer, wearing his reading glasses, moved past Anderton's desk over to Lamar who had just entered the apartment. \"We recovered that from Leo Crow's hotel room,\" he explained, picking up Anderton's .45 and holding it to where Lamar could see it. Lamar gently took the gun, sentimentally examining it, \"I remember when I gave this to him, back in Baltimore. He was one of those cops, still thought he could make a dent in all the bad there was in the world.\"—His hands closed around the gun, and he closed his eyes lowering his head. Giving a sad sigh he then looked up at Witwer—\"The irony is, sometimes it's the very vision that makes you want to make the world a better place that turns you into something you can't even recognize anymore.\" Witwer frowned, not exactly sure what Lamar meant by that. \"Well,\" Lamar finished, \"Let's get a move on. I've got a press meeting later today and hope not to miss it.\" Witwer pulled out a chair for the old man, \"Please sir.\" Lamar gladly sat down and getting comfortable he said, \"Tell me what you have.\" The young Federal agent then moved over to the chair behind Anderton's desk which contained Anderton's video equipment. Placing a video chip into the cylinder shaped movie player he pointed at the screen as the image began to play on Anderton's wall. \"This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively,\" he explained. Lamar watched, staring at the horrific images of the woman as she was brought to her death under the water. He glanced over at Witwer, \"John told me about this. You got this from containment?\" Witwer nodded, \"Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiell. Agatha's stream is missing.\" He then reached forward stopping the prevision, and reaching for another chip. Taking it, he blew the dust that might have collected off it and placed it in the movie player. \"Now this one,\" he continued pointing at the screen once again, \"is from the cyber parlor. Anderton downloaded this directly from Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.\" Lamar watched again, as the same events appeared before his eyes. The same people, the same murder. He chuckled slightly at Witwer's overacting and glanced over at him, \"It's the same prevision!\" Witwer stood up with a slight smile, amazed at Lamar's ignorance, \"Not quite.\" He then moved over next to the screen and turned to him. \"Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples…\"—Witwer glanced over at the image and pointed the direction of little waves on the water—\"moving away from the shore.\" Once doing this, he walked back over to the desk clicking over to Arthur and Dashiell's vision. \"Now the second image. This is the one from containment,\" he continued, \"this is what Art and Dash saw.\"—Witwer moved back over to the screen, a crooked smile coming across his face from his discovery—\"Watch the water. The wind's changed. The ripples are moving the other way.\" And once again, Witwer's finger traced the flow of the water, showing the difference. Taking his glasses off he moved back over to the video equipment, \"This murder's taking place at two different times.\" ------------- Diana anxiously watched as familiar signs for advertisements appeared as she slowly made her way towards Anderton's place in one of the maglev cars. If only she could speed up, to move faster where she could pass all these other vehicles. But the maglev was powered to where speeding couldn't happen, and the car wouldn't pass the speeding limit once it was accessed. After all, the police were too busy with Precrime to worry about such things. \"Oh please!\" she begged, the images of Witwer's death repeating once again in her head like shards of glass rubbing against each other, \"Let me make it there in time.\" She glanced down at her watch in which she had placed the time that she had left. COUNTING DOWN: FIFTEEN MINUTES. Biting her lip she looked around at the other maglev cars that surrounded her, cursing them in her mind knowing they were slowing her down. Diana then turned on the radio, hoping it could somehow release her mind from the repeating murder. It didn't however, as she turned to the oldies station and heard \"Smooth Criminal\" by Alien Ant Farm playing. She began to sing to the lyrics, unaware that her anxiousness had altered the chorus, \"Danny are you ok? You ok? Are you ok, Danny? Danny are you ok? You ok? Are you ok, Danny? Danny are you ok? You ok? Are you ok, Danny? You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal!\" -------------- \"According to the Sentry,\" Witwer continued, leaning on Anderton's desk, \"Anderton was watching this at containment right before he got tagged.\" Lamar nodded understandingly, \"Well I know. He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.\"—A small smile came across Lamar's face and he pointed at Witwer—\"He was concerned that you might find it.\" Witwer chuckled and moved back over towards the screen, \"Well he was right, I did find it. It was inside of Agatha the whole time, so the question is: Why would someone want this erased from the data file?\" Intrigued at what Witwer seemed to be questioning, Lamar urged him to move on. \"Danny, tell me what you're thinking.\" Witwer walked towards him, a matter-of-factly look placed on his face, \"I'm thinking someone got away with murder.\" Lamar frowned. \"How?\" \"Well Jad told me that the Precogs sometimes see the same murder more than once.\" \"It's called an echo,\" Lamar informed. \"Jad called it Precog déjà vu.\" \"We teach the techs to identify and disregard them.\" \"Yeah but,\" Witwer paused, chuckling under his breath, \"what if a technician only thought he was looking at an echo? What if what he was looking at was a completely different murder all together?\" Witwer thought he saw some fear in Lamar's blue eyes, but quickly dismissed. \"I don't understand,\" he confessed. \"All you'd have to do is hire someone to kill Anne Lively, someone like a drifter, a neuroin addict,\" Witwer excitedly spilled out the information as if containing it in his mind had been too hard, \"someone with nothing to loose. Precrime stops the murder from taking place, halos the killer, takes him away, but then, right then, someone else, having reviewed the prevision, commits the murder in exactly the same way. Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo.\"—Witwer waved his hand across his face—\"Erases it.\" There was silence. Witwer looked beaming at Lamar, proud of what he had figured out. \"Of course,\" Witwer continued walking in front of the projection of Anne Lively's murder, Lamar felt a hidden shock run across him, \"it would have to be someone with access to the previsions in the first place, someone fairly high up—\" Interrupting him Lamar placed a finger to his mouth, shushing him, and Witwer turned around. \"Do you know what I hear?\" he questioned, his index finger pointing to the sky, \"nothing. No footsteps up the stairs, no hovercraft out the window, and no clickity click of little spyders. And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny? Because right now the Precogs can't see a thing.\" And right then, at that moment, Witwer knew for sure who had truly set John Anderton up. And he knew that these were his last seconds to be alive. He closed his eyes, thinking of Diana and how he never got to say good-bye. And then he heard the sound of a gun being fired— —and felt nothing. There was no pain, nothing at all. Witwer would've thought death would be very painful, but luckily, it had killed him instantly. He couldn't believe it, and after a prolonged silence, he heard something fall to the floor. He opened his eyes. And what he saw shocked him. There was Lamar, frozen as his right shoulder bled slightly, Anderton's gun lying on the floor. And, behind Lamar, was Diana. A small tear rolled down her face as she finally spoke to the old man, \"You were wrong.\" Grimacing, Lamar grabbed his shoulder and turned to face her. \"What?\" He asked in shock, \"What are you talking about?!? He's the one you're supposed to shoot!\" Lamar pointed towards Witwer. Diana lowered her gun and walked forward. \"Oh no. The Precogs can see, Lamar. At least, this one can.\" Both Lamar and Witwer frowned. \"What?\" Witwer asked. She stopped right in front of Lamar, \"October 14, 2048. Anne Lively left the house in order to get her daughter back, leaving her other child at home, alone. The child was old enough then, where she didn't need to be called a child. She could drive and had a job of her own, but she stayed anyway. You see, she missed her little sister too. But her mother never came back, and neither did her sister. A mean man knew that without this girl's sister, there would be no precrime. She was the strongest of the three. And if he didn't have her, he couldn't be where he is now.\" \"Stop,\" Lamar murdered. \"And that's why the girl's mother never came home. The mean man had to get rid of her, shut her up. But how could he do it without the Precogs seeing? Easy, he hired a John Doe to do it for him. Knowing that the Precogs would see the murder. Precops come, they halo the killer, and leave. Leaving the mean man and Anne Lively by themselves, all alone. And that's when he does it, the mean man changes into the same outfit as John Doe, and committed the murder in exactly the same way. \"He knew the techs would think it was an echo, and would ignore it. He had fooled them; he had fooled the two other Precogs, but not Anne Lively's daughters. They were going to see the murder no matter how he did it or tried to hide it. The mean man realized this too, remembering the daughter left at home, and ran. He went to find her. And he did too. She was just about to get into her car when she saw the mean man coming towards her. She ran too. But it was hopeless, the mean man caught her. And after that, he erased her memory.\" \"Stop,\" Lamar begged. \"He erased anything having to do with her sister, with her mother. He couldn't have killed her, although he wanted to. But what he didn't know, was that he did. He turned Anne Lively's daughter into someone else, creating a whole new childhood in her mind, changing her name. He lied to her, telling her that she was in the witness protection program, and talked her into getting new eyes. And then, six years later he tried once more to get rid of the daughter, paying a neuroin addict to commit the murder. But that didn't work either. Precrime saved her. But now…\" \"Please, just stop…\" \"That girl remembers. She knows her name is truly Abigail Lively, and she knows that she's truly a Precog also.\" Lamar's face grew into a look of shock. \"What?! You—you're a Precog? How?\" She smiled. \"Because, Hineman never let you have all the children that survived to be what they are today. She knew, even before you murdered Anne Lively, that you were out for the benefit of yourself, and not the Precogs.\" \"I can't believe this. This wasn't supposed to happen…\" Lamar muttered glancing away. The thoughts of the past and what he thought he got away with swamped him like the crashing ocean waves swallowing sand in high tide. \"Look,\" Diana continued, \"I'm not holding any grudges. I'm not saying I still like you either, but the fact is if I wanted to kill you I would've already done it. You've killed my mother, you've made my best friend America's Most Wanted, and you just nearly killed my boyfriend. You're not going to get away with this.\" \"…this won't happen…\" Lamar continued under his breath. \"I'm going to have to turn you in.\" She told him not hearing what he had said. Reaching into her pocket she felt for her cell phone when images flashed before her eyes like fireworks exploding. She saw herself running, and she saw her cell phone lying on the ground of an alley way, broken. There was no way of reaching the team. Another picture shot through, this one fractured and incomplete. Her gun was no longer safely in her hand….gunfire… Lamar and Witwer watched as her eyes grew distant and hollow, no longer present in this world. And if they had looked down to where her hand was, they would've noticed it was barely twitching. Diana saw another image, her face grimacing and she cried out with pain. There was a flash of crimson…she was falling…gunfire…blood… Her eyes closed, she didn't move. \"But you can choose…you know what is going to happen…choose…\" And then, her hearing picked up a voice, young and strong, \"Oh but I have.\" Diana quickly opened her eyes in fear and in an instant saw Lamar spin away from in front of her. And in that moment there was gunfire, it all happening so fast that Diana didn't even realize it had happened until she felt the immense pain in her chest. She stood there dazed for a moment, crimson swallowing the vibrant blue of her shirt. And she saw Danny, standing before her, smoke coming from the metal barrel of Anderton's .45 that he was holding. His beautiful eyes large with fear and pain as they looked into his beloved's crystal blue. The moment seemed to hang in the air, frozen in time, and then Diana fell. She hit the ground hard seeing stars flash before her and her head felt flooded and dizzy. It was a struggle to sit up, and she found her breathing grow heavy. There was the sound of a gun dropping to the floor and she felt the presence of Witwer before her. She felt his strong arms wrap around her and she relaxed as he held her slightly upright. \"D-Danny?\" she weakly spoke, \"Wha? Why?\" It was the first time she had seen Witwer so vulnerable. She wasn't sure if she liked it. \"Diana,\" just speaking her name brought tears to his eyes, \"I…I didn't mean to get you. I was aiming for Lamar and he moved! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!\" He glanced away trying to fight the pain that ripped his heart, and in that moment Diana wondered who was truly in more pain, him or her. She smiled slightly. \"It's okay.\" \"No, no it's not. We're going to get you to a hospital. Just hold on.\" \"Danny, it's okay.\" She felt a lump growing in her throat what she thought was the size of a baseball. A tear fell down her cheek. \"I've had the best time of my life—and I must also say the worst—in these last few days. I don't think I could ask for more. I'll be fine.\" \"But Diana, can't you see? Hold on. Don't let go. I don't wanna be responsible for your death. I'm not sure if I could live with myself.\" He ran his hand across her hair and gave her forehead a gentle kiss. She smiled again, not wanting Witwer to act this way. A pool of blood had already made its way upon them, the crimson permanently staining Witwer's white work shirt. Diana rose her hand up and caressed his cheek, the blood from her hands leaving a handprint. She stared lovingly as his tears fell down on her shirt. \"Oh my love,\" she sweetly told him, \"please don't cry. I can wash my bloody hands. We'll start a new life, you and me, together.\" Witwer held her closer, cursing himself, Lamar, and the world in particular for not being able to change what he had done. \"All I know,\" he told her, \"is that I love you. And I won't let you go.\"—He shook his head—\"If only I was thinking. I was just acting on impulse and I was so angry. If only I hadn't grabbed the gun…\" Diana brought her hand to his mouth and shushed him, \"Don't get started again with that 'if only' junk. It was inevitable. I saw it happen before you even knew what you were doing.\"—she chuckled—\"Is this familiar or what? The photon milk…maybe I'm just accident prone or something.\" \"Diana…\" \"Now you understand why I said the Precogs are burdened with the future, cos I was. And if I dwelled upon the 'if onlys' then I'm not sure if I could've made it this long and remained sane.\" She came forward using all her strength and kissed Witwer. \"I love you,\" she told him. \"No, it's not over yet!\" he cried as her body grew limp in his arms, and he said more softly, \"Stay…\"[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect.

Only a few minutes ago she had saved his life. She saved him from not dying. But him, Danny Witwer, with the gun in his very hands, couldn't save her from dying. In fact, it was by his hands that this came upon them. He cursed himself, wishing he could take those things back. He slowly opened his eyes, turning to face Lamar. Witwer's face grimaced with anger and he stood up. Lamar stared back, his cold watery eyes unemotional. He had won. Everything was working out for him, no matter who he had left bloody and bruised along the way. Or dead , Witwer thought to himself. \"It was you,\" he growled, Lamar gave a pretended look of shock; \"you killed her.\" The old man shook his head, \"Oh I don't think so. Last time I checked it was you who held the gun that killed her.\" Witwer could feel the anger exploding in him and he began to charge forward when Lamar held up the very gun that had killed Diana. He stopped in his tracks and looked at Lamar with fear. \"I'm not going to let you try and kill me again.\" Then suddenly, there was the explosion of glass breaking, and as shards fell to the ground so did Precops. They swamped Witwer and two held him back as he began to struggle to break free. Lamar holstered Anderton's gun with a smile. \"How? How could they have known?\" Witwer cried. \"Obviously,\" Lamar answered, \"Agatha has finally been retrieved.\" Witwer glared, \"You arrogant bastard! You won't get away with this!\"—Struggling, he turned to Fletcher—\"Gordon! Arrest him! He's the true murderer here! He's the one who framed Anderton!\" Fletcher shook his head. \"Sorry Chief, but I believe it was you who we saw was about to kill Lamar. Why would Lamar want to frame Anderton anyway? They're almost like father and son!\" \"Exactly,\" Lamar agreed, \"And I have to say it is very upsetting to know that Anderton will have to face the Department of Containment…as will you.\" Witwer lunged forward but was quickly pulled back by the precops. Lamar turned to Fletcher, \"He seems to be in an unstable state. I feel like the desire to control Precrime has pushed him over the edge. Don't listen to whatever he tells you.\" Witwer began to glare at the old man. \"Gordon!\" It was Knott. There was fear in his voice as he called out to the leader of the team. Fletcher turned to his voice and his heart jumped. There lying in front of Knott was Diana in a pool of blood. \"Oh my God!\" he exclaimed rushing over and knelt down. \"Is she okay?\" Knott shook his head, \"I don't know.\" \"Well find out!\" Fletcher stood up and turned back to Witwer and Lamar. \"How did that happen?\" he asked, pointing back to Diana. Witwer began to speak when Lamar interrupted him, \"Diana had figured out what Witwer was trying to do, and came to stop him. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stop his actions in time to save poor Diana's life.\"—He looked over at Diana sadly, and Witwer knew he was faking his emotions—\"She was one of my best cops too.\" Witwer growled, \"Liar.\" The two cops holding Witwer frowned, was that truly right? Didn't Witwer love Diana? Fletcher couldn't understand it, why would you kill someone you cared for? But Fletcher didn't question, he trusted Lamar. So he pulled out the halo, pressing a button where the compact form spread into the shape of headphones. Then he spoke in a serious tone, \"Danny Witwer, by mandate of the District of Columbia, Precrime division, I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Diana Warren and the future murder of Lamar Burgess.\" Although Witwer resisted, the halo still crept closer to his head and right before Fletcher clamped it on, he gave a glare to Lamar and said, \"You will pay.\" Then with that, the halo made contact to his head and he felt a shock, everything going black. ---------------- It actually seemed more like a dream as Witwer observed his surroundings. His body wouldn't seem to reply to what he told it to do, and it all seemed like he was merely the audience, watching as he was placed in his suit and strapped to the back of his Containment cell wall. He heard the click as the halo secured his head to the back. It all felt so strange though, he knew he was looking around the room, but his eyes didn't move. He screamed as loud as he could, cursing everyone he could think of, but no words would come out. His mouth didn't even move at all! And then, he began to be raised to his confinement. \"Don't do this Gideon!\" He cried, hoping his attempts weren't completely futile, \"It's Burgess! He did it! John was only framed because he knew too much! Then so did I, and Diana got killed because of it!\"—Witwer could feel tears of frustration run down his face, even though nothing came—\"Please, you've got to hear me!!\" But Gideon of course couldn't, he merely smiled watching Witwer be placed where he, as Gideon believed, rightly belonged. \"Welcome Danny,\" he smugly said, \"It's a whole new world on the other side, huh?\"—he paused, almost like he was waiting for an answer he knew wouldn't come—\"It's actually kind of a rush. They say that you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes, that all your dreams come true.\" And then Witwer was fastened into what could be truly called his coffin, since that's where he would be spending eternity. And right before the darkness came, as Witwer was turned and directed to his place in the towers of convicts, he saw a familiar face. Looking at the name it read: J. Anderton. It just didn't seem right, how evil would seem to win this time. Lamar had eliminated those who had known too much, those who would oppose him. After all, Witwer was a federal agent! He had chosen this job because he wanted to protect the innocent, to stop things like what happened to his father. And he had failed. His \"coffin\" attached to the top tower of the criminals and the light right above Anderton lit up reading: D. Witwer #1111. \"Gideon!!!\" he cried with one last attempt as reality faded beyond his grasp, \" Gideon!!! \" But the grinding blast of the pipe organ drowned out any noise worth hearing, and Witwer returned to the vast darkness. The halo on his head lighting up to activate the life-system that kept him alive in this dream state, creating a golden ring above his head. --------------- \"Danny?\" a voice called out to him, \"wake up, Danny…\" He opened his eyes; everything seemed to come in so blurry at first, almost like he was actually seeing the world for the first time. And then things focused, and he saw Diana crouching before him. \"Diana—\" he felt a rush of excitement when suddenly he remembered all that had happened, \"you're not real…you can't be! You're dead.\" She smiled, \"That you will have to decide on your own. Have faith, Danny.\" Sitting up, Witwer reached into his shirt pulling out the rosary. He stared at it for a moment, his mind fading back to his father. He closed his eyes and suddenly once he opened them he was there again, back in Dublin. He was fifteen again, church service had just let out and he, his mother, and his father were smiling as they began to step down the cement steps. But then a black figure came out of nowhere, a gun in his hands. Then everything repeated again, Witwer and his mother were pushed out of the way of the bullets as his father moved in front of them. And then he fell, his body crashing to the ground like a rag doll. Witwer's mother screamed as he quickly rushed to his father's side. Blood slowly dripped down the steps as he tried to grasp his father's last words. \"Take care of your mother, Danny,\" the weak voice said, \"and anyone else along the way. Remember me…and don't forget what you've learned…\" His father's large hands placed his rosary into young Witwer's. And Danny held it tightly as he watched his father's body go limp. \"'When everything else fails…faith is what guides the future',\" Witwer spoke as a small tear ran down his cheek, the world around him returning to a vast void of darkness, \"And look where that's led me Dad! I've failed! I've failed you, my country, my love! Faith?\"—he gave a small chuckle—\"I believe it's a little late for that.\" Then he gave the rosary one last tender kiss, and then threw it into the darkness, hoping he would never see it again. \"It's never too late,\" Diana spoke; she smiled, \"I want to show you something.\" Witwer reached to grab her hand, but it merely passed on through. \"Follow me,\" she continued. The void around them changed again. Witwer looked around and found that they had come to a familiar place, a cozy little cottage down near Chesapeake Bay. Lara is talking on the phone with someone as Anderton pulls up in his red Lexus. She seems worried. \"He's no killer, Lamar,\" She says into the receiver right before he hangs up. \"I know,\" Lamar replies. The images weren't exactly complete, but the next image shows Lara allowing Anderton and Agatha into her house. Now it was just Lara and Anderton, as they sat on a bench overlooking the bay. \"They used Sean,\" he told her shaking his head, \"They wanted me to think Crow killed him. But he didn't. No, he didn't.\" Lara frowned, \"Well why would they set you up?\" Anderton shook his head frowning, he wasn't even sure himself. Suddenly a light came on in his expression, \"Because I found out about her.\" \"About who?\" John frustratingly brought his hands up to his head and winced, \"How could I have not seen this?\" \"Seen what?\" \"Anne Lively.\" He quickly gets up from his seat and heads into the house with Lara following. The image moved to where Anderton, Lara, and Agatha were in Sean's room. \"Dr. Hineman once said to me,\" Agatha explains, \"'The dead don't die. They look on and help.' Remember that, John.\" She then begins to speak of their son, Sean, the light of the sun behind her giving an angelic glow. And Anderton and Lara begin to cry, to hear of their son's future, of what could have happened, was too much. \"There was so much love in this house.\" Agatha concluded. \"I want him back so bad,\" John said in between tears, sitting on the floor now as he places a hand to his head. Tears swell in Agatha's eyes, \"So did she. Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back. But it was too late. The little girl was already gone.\" \"She's still alive?\" Anderton asked. \"She didn't die, but she's not alive.\" Anderton moved forward, placing his hands on the window seat Agatha was sitting on. \"Agatha,\" he spoke to her, \"Who killed your mother? Who killed Anne Lively?\" \"I'm sorry John,\" she replied, placing a hand on his cheek, \"but you're going to have to run again.\" \"What?\" \"RUN!!!\" She screamed, a held out yell. And in that minute, precops burst in, and the images slowly change into something else. And as what Witwer just saw, he knew that was the past. This new vision that was coming, it was the future. They were now on the balcony of the Willard Hotel, the very place the acceptance of Precrime was to be taken. Lamar appeared on the balcony as he walked with a seemingly casual stride. He stopped at the concrete railing, grasping tightly to it as one hand was held up to his ear. Leaning forward he looked down into the dark void below him, and then into D.C., highlighted by the lights of people in their homes. He looked back for a moment, then threw whatever was in his ear into the darkness below. Something must have made a noise, for Witwer watched as Lamar quickly turned around. Then another person appeared, this one clothed in a black pullover, the hood covering his face, hiding his identity. They spoke for a while, but suddenly a fear and helplessness came over Lamar's face, and he seemed to be pleading with the man. And then, the dark man slowly drew his gun, and spoke the last words Lamar would ever hear: \"Precrime is at an end, Lamar…and so are you, paid in full.\" And then, gunfire, point blank on the center of Lamar's forehead. The dark man turned as the body fell limply to the ground and reentered the hotel. Then the image faded, and once more Witwer returned to black void. And there was Diana before him again. \"Can you see? Remember this, Danny,\" she told him, slowly beginning to fade, \"And remember me.\" \"No! Don't leave! Not yet!\" Witwer pleaded, but Diana moved her hand and placed it on his cheek. And in that moment he wished he could remember how it felt for her to touch him, for he felt nothing. He moved his hand up to her translucent one, and it passed through to touching his own cheek. With a smile she leaned forward, closing her eyes as she began to kiss him. But as her lips came to reach his, she dissolved into the nothing that surrounded him. And Witwer was alone, again. -------------- \"This is all my fault,\" Lamar Burgess explained, coming forward to Lara and embracing her. He was only wearing a white button up t-shirt and slacks, considering she walked in as he was in the middle of dressing for the gala ball they would be having at the Willard Hotel. Kissing her gently on each check she replied solemnly, \"There was nothing anyone could do.\" Lamar studied her eyes for a moment, making sure there was no hidden meaning behind what she said. \"Lara…uh…\" He began, then turned taking her hand and led her over to the couch in his office. On the coffee table right in front of it was a rather small white box, inside was Anderton's belongings. \"I thought you might want to have those,\" Lamar explained as she walked up to the box and sat down onto the couch. Lamar paused for a minute, peering inside the box himself as he finished buttoning up his shirt. Somehow Lara's grave behavior unnerved him. \"I haven't worn this in years,\" Lamar told her as he motioned to his shirt which he was still buttoning, \"Just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.\" \"You look great,\" Lara told him, picking up one of Anderton's picture frames as he turned to move in front of his mirror. Lamar watched as he saw her reflection pick up Anderton's .45 out of the box. \"I knew he was having trouble for some time,\" he said, \"but I did nothing about it.\" He began to continue on when his secretary walked into his office, \"Excuse me but the guy from USA Today is here.\" \"Tell him not now.\" \"He just wanted a few minutes before—\" \"Not now!\" Lamar raised his voice rather agitated. Nodding the secretary quickly left, leaving Lamar and Lara alone again. \"I thought you were retiring,\" she told him as she lifted up yet another picture of Anderton's which had him, her, and Sean together. She couldn't help but wish that happiness could return. Lamar grabbed his overcoat and put it on, \"I was, but this incident with John made me realize the fragility of all this.\"—he cleared his throat then held out his arms in an almost shrug-like gesture—\"This is John's legacy as much as it is my own.\" He turned and moved back over to his desk where he grabbed one of the pins to place on his overcoat, \"Now I have an obligation to protect that.\" Turning back to her he walked over as he placed the pin on his overcoat collar, \"Lara, I know how difficult this is for you but, maybe you can find some closure in the fact that John finally found the man who killed your son.\" He turned back to the mirror as he tried to place the back onto his pin. \"Who's Anne Lively?\" Lara asked. The point of the pin missed the back it was supposed to go through and stuck Lamar's thumb. The impact of the question hitting his like a two ton anvil. He sucked on his thumb for a second, the pain slightly dulling. \"Who?\" he questioned. \"Anne Lively,\" she repeated. \"John was talking about her right before they took him.\" Lamar turned to her and tried once more to place the back to his pin, \"I don't know who that is.\" \"John said something about him being set up because he 'found out about her.'\" \"Well, we know why John was tagged,\" Lamar explained moving forward. \"He also said Crow was a fake.\" \"What are you trying to say?\" She stood up and walked towards him. \"Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work for you?\" Lamar placed his hands on his hips. \"Sean.\" \"Yes. He came here to work for you because he thought if he could just…stop that kind of thing from happening.\" Her voice quavered as she tried to fight the tears. \"I understand.\" \"No, I don't think you do.\" She quickly moved over to look out of one of Lamar's windows. \"Sir,\" his secretary returned, \"they want to start the press conference in two minutes.\" Lamar ignored her and moved behind Lara, \"Lara, John was the best cop I ever knew. And in some ways also the best man.\"—he sighed—\"But the scars he carried around, well… I know he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him.\" She wiped her eyes. \"And I also know why he married you:\" he explained, \"You're as stubborn as he is.\" She gave a small laugh as she turned around and slightly smiled, \"Lamar—\" He quickly interrupted her, \"Lara, uh, do you know how to tie one of these?\"—he motioned to his bow tie and chuckled—\"Could you please give me a hand? I'm all thumbs you see!\" She laughed too as he turned and sat down. Moving behind him she began to tie it. \"Listen,\" Lamar told her, \"I'll tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll have Gideon run the containment files, hmm? See if anyone drowned a woman named—what did you say her name was?\" Lara paused, her hands failing to finish the bow. \"Anne Lively, but I never said she drowned.\" The gentle smile on Lamar's face faded, and it was soon replaced with a stern look. Great, now she knows something's wrong , Lamar though. He stood up, there before Lara he was clearly a head taller than her, and in that moment she saw that as old as he was, the age should not fool you. He was strong, despite his appearance, but she held her ground. He moved closer, and rolled the chair in front of him out of the way. Slowly he moved right up to her, as they stared each other in the eyes. Silence. It was broken with the sound of his secretary's high heels clicking on the wooden floor. \"Sir,\" she told him, \"the press conference is starting.\" \"I'll be right there.\" He replied, then looked back at Lara, \"We'll talk about this later. Perhaps tomorrow? I'll come by the cottage.\" The gentle smile returned, though now Lara could feel it was almost forced. She frowned slightly, not sure if his visit would be good or bad. She returned the smile, and slightly nodded. Then with that, Lamar left. She waited to move once he was completely gone, and turned to the white box of Anderton's belongings. The light shining through it giving a silhouette of what it contained, and clearly at the top she saw Anderton's .45. Things became clear, and she understood everything now. She knew what she had to do. -------------- Reporters crowded around the Willard Hotel, cameras flashing and film rolling lit up that dark Washington D.C. night. But the true excitement existed on the top floor, where applause covered the room as Lamar stepped up on to the banquet's stage. \"Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, director of the new national Precrime!\" An announcer called out over the roar of clapping. The thunderous noise quieted down however, as Lamar raised his hands signaling he was about to speak. His secretary walked over to the side of the stage and handed him a present. With a smile she said, \"On behalf of the staff, we would like to present you with this. Congratulations, sir.\" Taking the wooden box he tenderly opens with a smile exclaiming, \"My God…\" A cheer rises up in the crowd as the secretary looked back out into the audience giving a small laugh. What Lamar saw in that little box was a pearl handled revolver with five bullets. \"How did you get this?\" he asked. \"I padded your expense account for six months,\" she replied jokingly, which made everyone laugh. Beaming, Lamar held the contents up for everyone to see, \"Revolvers like this one were given to generals at the end of the Civil War by their troops. The cylinders were loaded with five gold-plated bullets to symbolize the end of the destruction and death that had ripped the country apart for six years. Ladies and gentlemen, with Precrime going national, maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us will have to discharge another firearm ever again.\"—the audience applauded at this, and Lamar's wife, Celeste, proudly led a standing elevation—\"Now enjoy yourselves! Enjoy yourselves! That's an order!\" As he stepped down off the platform Celeste came over to him and embraced him, \"Does this mean we can use the lake house on weekends?\" Lamar laughed, \"I hope so.\" Though on their table, his ear piece cell phone began ringing. Over the clatter of greetings and pats on the backs Lamar's secretary answered the ear piece, plugging one ear so she could hear better. \"Hello?\" she said listening to the person on the other end, \"Yes. Right away.\"—she moved over to Lamar who was swamped with people wanting autographs, interviews, opinions—\"Sir? Sir, you have an emergency call on your private line.\" Confused, Lamar took the ear piece and placed it to his ear. He adjusted it as he continued to move around the ballroom. \"Yes, this is Burgess,\" he said into the receiver. The voice he heard reply, though, was not a pleasant surprise. \"Hello Lamar.\" It was Anderton. The smile faded from Lamar's lips and he stopped dead in his tracks. There was a sinister sarcasm in Anderton's words, \"I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it. You created a world without murder.\" There was a tap on his shoulder as he nervously turned around. \"Sir!\" a man stood before him, \"Everyone wants your name on a hat, can you sign these?\" Taking the pen he was given he quickly began writing his signature over and over. Anderton's voice came again, \"And all you had to do was kill someone to do it.\" The phone rang in the Analytical room where the squadron of precops celebrated on their own. Though it wasn't much of a celebration; no one was in the mood to toast to Anderton's capture. Personally, none of them really cared what happened to Witwer. Jad spun over in his rolling chair answering the call, \"A-room. Jad.\" -------------- The crowd in the ballroom was wild as Lara secretly watched from a window in the outer hall. Everyone was wanting at lease one word with Lamar. She turned away as she replied into her headset, \"Jad? It's Lara. John needs a favor.\" -------------- \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Lamar told Anderton through the receiver as he began to hand the hats out to surrounding people. \"I'm talking about Agatha's mother, Diana's mother, Anne Lively. Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up. But, surprise, she cleaned herself up. And she wanted her daughter back, she wanted Agatha.\" Anderton explained. --------------- Wally looked over as Agatha let out a deep gasp as she twitched in the Temple, back in her chair surrounded by photon milk. He rushed over to her as she tossed and turned in fright. \"Jad are you getting this?\" He called up to Jad in the Analytical Room. Looking up on the screen Wally saw a vision playing, the vision of a woman beside a lake, waiting for something. \"It's a single stream from the female only with no time or incident data,\" he explained, \"Whatever this is it isn't the future, it already happened.\" --------------- Lamar's head spun. All these people crowding him! And that voice in his head…Anderton's voice, \"You know the rest I'm sure. Not to mention what followed after Anne Lively's murder. What you did to Diana. It made such a smooth cover up to anger Witwer into shooting her, didn't it? Right after she had revealed all to both him and you. Why, you could say that you have Witwer to thank to be standing where you are now, signing autographs.\" Frowning Lamar lost all focus on the chaos surrounding him. He worriedly turned about, wondering if he could find Anderton hiding in one dark corner. But he saw no one. ---------------- \"Jad, what are you doing?\" Evanna asked as the squadron watched him take the memory slide out of the previewing screen and placed it in his computer. The memory slide containing Agatha's vision. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jad, what are you doing with that?\" another Precop asked. He ignored them though as he sat down and began pressing the screen buttons to transfer the data. \"What are you up to, Big Man?\" one of the officers asked. \"Jad?\" another moved forward, \"Jad? Now let's think before you send that.\" \"Whoa, slow down.\" But it was too late to back out now; Jad had already pressed the send button before the cop could finish his sentence. ----------------- Immediately the screen behind the podium where Lamar had given his speech changed. Everyone turned to see a movie of some sort begin to play. It started off rather blurry, but soon came into focus. There stood a woman, her hair a dark auburn, her face worn and haggard, waiting. Smiling faces faded as silence came across the room. Everyone was soon entrapped by the silent movie, curious of its importance. Lamar was last to turn around and to his horror saw the complete vision of the murder of Anne Lively. The haggard face soullessly stared out into the crowd from beneath her watery grave. The image backed up, it showed the masked John Doe drag her into the water, her arms and legs flailing to break free. But she wasn't strong enough. He kicked her, driving her closer to the water. \"Things worked out in the end, didn't they Lamar?\" Anderton came in again, \"the only people who ever found out were quickly eliminated of ever causing a threat to your career. Witwer and me, we were locked up. Diana…killed.\" The old man hurried out of the ball room, the small wooden box securely in his hand. He nervously looked about, making sure no one was near as he would make his getaway. Agatha was back, and Precrime could see once more. He had to be on his guard or he would hear footsteps up the stairs, a hover craft outside the window, the clickity-click of little spyders. He watched behind closed doors as the Precops quickly rushed forward grabbing the John Doe and haloing him. Anne Lively watched the future murderer be drug away with disbelief she had almost died. Then Lamar came into the image, walking over the leave cluttered ground of the forest before the lake. Anne rushed towards him, tears in her eyes as she cried, \"Where's my daughter?\" Lamar took her by the arm and led her back towards the water, comfortingly patting her hand. Pointing out into the distance he told her, \"She's right there.\" \"Where?\" Anne asked ask the old man drew away from her, moving behind her. He took off his brown trench coat revealing black clothing that was exactly the same as the John Doe's. --------------- \"Run,\" Agatha gasped from her chamber in the Temple, \"Run!!\" --------------- Anne turned around in fear only in time to see Lamar place on the black face mask. In this moment as the crowd watched a swell of gasps fell across the room, and Celeste fainted. They continued watching as the terrorized face of Anne Lively screamed for help beneath the thrashing water she was pushed under. \"There was one person you forgot about however,\" Lamar could sense a smile in John's face, \"Lara. The one person I had told everything to.\"—he looked over as he heard a door open from the far side of the hall. And someone walked out, clothed in black with a black pullover, the hood covering their face. It wasn't heading for Lamar though, it was leaving. Anderton , he thought—\"As you probably noticed she was able to piece the puzzle together once you lied about not knowing who Anne Lively is.\" With a malicious glint in the old man's watery eyes, he followed the hooded figure. He followed it until he reached the kitchen. Walking in he had lost sight of it, which scared him more. Stopping by one of the kitchen shelves he opened his box, pulling out his revolver in which he placed the bullets. Anderton's voice came again, \"So, what are you going to do, Lamar? What are you going to do?\" -------------- Agatha jumped in her chair, her legs flying over to the side immersing themselves in the milk as she let out a gasp. The Red Ball alarm went off. \"We got a red ball!\" Wally called out to the team above him in the Analytical room. The sound of the wooden ball rolling down its tube came to the squadron's ears. Every one of them jumped as it hit the bottom of the tube, and shocked they read the victim's name. \"Think about the lives that little girl has saved,\" Agatha said, being the voice of Lamar. --------------- \"Think about the lives that little girl has saved,\" Lamar said as he warily walked through the kitchen, making sure Anderton wouldn't come from behind and stab him, or anything of that sort, \"Think about all the lives she will save. That little girl…could have saved Sean!\" There was silence on the other line for a moment, Lamar could almost feel the anger rising in Anderton. \"DON'T YOU EVER SAY HIS NAME!!\" Anderton screamed into the receiver, making Lamar wince at the sudden rush of pain in that ear. But Anderton's voice wasn't heard anywhere else, just the receiver. Lamar sped up as he continued walking, the ear piece no longer attached to his ear. ---------------- \"You used the memory of my dead son to set me up,\" Arthur spoke right behind Agatha, the voice of Anderton. ----------------- Lamar held it at a certain distance as Anderton raged, \"You used the memory of my dead son to set me up!! That was the one thing you knew that would drive me to murder.\" ----------------- \"What are you going to do now, Lamar?\" Arthur continued. ----------------- \"What are you going to do now Lamar?\" Anderton's voice softened, a sinister glint under his breath. ------------------ \"How are you gonna—\" ------------------- \"—shut me up?\" Anderton continued. Lamar's pace had quickened even more, and the fear in the old man was rising. And then, the kitchen ended; and before him stood two tall, open glass doors. He slightly slowed down as he walked past them, paranoia surrounding him as he looked around the dark night sky on the balcony. Looking forward he could see the Washington Monument illuminated, standing proud among the dark buildings that cowered around it. He stopped as he reached the rail, however, his old wrinkled hands firmly grasping it as he looked down into the dark void below. \"Lamar, it's over,\" Anderton told him, his voice calmed down now, \"The question to ask is, what are you gonna do now?\" But Lamar didn't hear that last bit, for as Anderton said this his voice was fading into the blackness below, as Lamar threw the ear piece over the railing. And he gave a sigh of relief, hoping that was it, that Anderton was just a nightmare back from his containment. But as he looked over the railing, the light from inside changed on his back, and he knew he wasn't alone. He spun around, and before him was a darkly clothed hooded man: Anderton. Lamar couldn't see his face, but he could tell Anderton was smiling. \"John—\" Lamar began but stopped as he slowly took off his hood. He saw in shock the man was completely bald, and below his thick dark brows were two grinning hazel eyes. \"Not John, I'm afraid,\" the man replied. \"Witwer?!\" Lamar's hand fumbled in his pocket, quickly feeling cold metal. Danny Witwer slowly moved forward. \"Wasn't expecting me were you?\" The cockiness and pride in his voice was sickening to Lamar, \"It all adds up, though. You murdered the one person I loved! You—\" \"I believe you were the one holding the gun as she fell to the floor,\" Lamar replied smugly. Witwer winced, knowing he was right. \"Quit kidding yourself, Witwer,\" Lamar told him, \"You and I are one in the same. We are both willing to kill for what we love, it's that simple.\" \"We are nothing alike!!\" Witwer cried, \"All I wanted was to protect the world from a mistake, a flaw, if you will. The last thing I wanted to do was kill someone! I must say you are one smooth criminal, Lamar. But it's over now, everyone knows what you've done.\"—Witwer slowly pulled out his gun, and Lamar felt his heart skip a beat, he couldn't pull out his own gun in time without getting killed first—\"Precrime is at an end, Lamar…and so are you, paid in full.\" \"Danny, please,\" Lamar cowered, \"think about what you are doing! Does this truly justify? The precogs can see—\" \"Shh,\" Witwer replied placing a finger to his lips mocking Lamar, \"Do you know what I hear? Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs, no hover craft flying up, and no clickity-click of little spyders. And do you know why I don't hear any of those things?\"—he threw his gun to the ground right before Lamar—\"Because I saw my future, and I chose.\" Turning Witwer gave a sigh, he had done it. He had been able to walk away with his chest clear and a weight off his shoulders. He began to walk away when suddenly he felt the cold metal of a gun barrel to his bald head. There was silence for a moment, and Witwer was afraid he had made the wrong choice. \"The precogs have seen this no doubt,\" he said unflinching. \"No doubt,\" Lamar replied. \"You see the dilemma don't you? If you don't kill me, the precogs were wrong and Precrime is over. If you do kill me, you go away, but it proves the system works, the precogs were right.\" Witwer knew Lamar was stuck with this. He had to choose between Precrime, and his life. Lamar said nothing. \"So what are you going to do now?\" Witwer asked. \"What's it worth? Just one more murder… You'll rot in hell with a halo but people will still believe in Precrime. All you have to do is kill me, like they said you would.\"—he heard the gun cock, Witwer wet his lips—\"Except, you know your own future, which means you can change it if you want to. You still have a choice, Lamar, like I did.\" \"Yes,\" Lamar replied, \"I have a choice…and I've made it. Forgive me, Danny.\" Gunfire. Witwer's eyes grew as he jumped at the sound. But once again, there was no pain. Quickly he turned around to see a growing blood stain on Lamar's shirt as the old man slowly sunk to the ground. \"Ask the others,\" he managed out weakly, \"to forgive me too.\" And in that instant precops dropped from the dispenser above, only too late. Among them was Anderton, who pushed to the front to watch the man he once considered a father, die. Lamar's hand grew limp, and the pearl-handled revolver slid to the ground. Bending down Anderton felt for a pulse, but he was gone. Despite the anger he had felt toward him, the murderer he knew he truly was, Anderton still felt sorry the kind man he once knew. It didn't seem right, and he wished it didn't have to end this way. Even Witwer felt a bit of remorse, knowing how much Diana also cared for the old man. Then the crowd from the banquet appeared, rushing forward to the scene of suicide, and Lara rushed forward embracing Anderton, tears in her eyes. Witwer could feel his own eyes watering up as he watched Celeste frantically rush forward to her husband, fighting the man that was holding her back. She knelt down beside Lamar, and cried over him. Witwer knew the feeling, the fact that you couldn't bring someone back, even though they were still there, right there in you arms.[Chapter 10] Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affiliated with the writers, directors, producers, ect.

All prisoners were unconditionally pardoned and released; although police departments kept watch on many of them for years to come. ---------------- The rain was pouring that afternoon. Grief overwhelmed the surrounding air within the grey skies that dampened the day. All was silent in Washington, D.C., no song of birds nor the sounds of any other creature broke that solemn day. They had all gathered together, those who used to work for Precrime, almost using this funeral as a closure. Many of them would never see each other again; it almost didn't seem right. Six years ago they thought Precrime would revolutionize the future of crime, not lead to this. The dark blue tarp shielding them kept a steady beat of the intervals of rain as they sat in foldable chairs upon the graveyard. The preacher's deep voice grew louder each time the rain hardened, and softer as it slowly let off. Danny Witwer, however, wasn't paying attention. His eyes were fixed on the coffin. The big silver metal coffin. Tears were falling from his eyes, and he thought he could empathize with the clouds at this moment. Oh my love, please don't cry. I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life… Diana's last words repeated in his head. He never truly wanted to come here. The graveyard with the solemn rain brought too much pain to his mind. He still couldn't believe all that happened. What started out as an innocent inspection became the biggest story since the precogs were discovered. And now it's over. The adrenaline has lowered, and there is no threat to mankind. But Witwer was not comforted by this. As the preacher finished his speech they all stood up. Some of the faculty left then and there, but those who were close to the deceased remained. Witwer walked over to the coffin and stared down at it, the sound of crying and sorrow filling his ears. He stood there for a while, running the past through his mind, wishing he could have done things different, wishing he could have changed— —A hand fell onto his shoulder, a golden ring on the ring finger. Through its weight he could feel the grief that enveloped the person it belonged to. Witwer turned around; looking into his fiancé's tear filled crystal blue eyes, and embraced her. Diana buried her head in his shoulder crying softly. Witwer was careful as he held her; he didn't want to bother her sore arm supported by a sling that kept the torn tissue near her heart together where it needed to be healed. Bandages were wrapped around her upper torso above her chest, protecting the wound that Witwer, himself, caused. \"Oh God,\" Witwer muttered, \"I can't believe I almost lost you. I don't know what I would have done without you.\" He tenderly kissed her on the top of her head. She pulled her head back revealing her bloodshot eyes above her blotchy cheeks. Only too soon was she brought to the medical room of Precrime. Shorty after Witwer had left Knott had discovered the slightest hint of a pulse, and when they took her to the surgery room she was half-way dead. The doctor said she would live, but if the muscles were pulled or torn again, it could be deadly. Diana was restricted of ever continuing her job as a policewoman. She gave a weak smile, \"I-I know Lamar truly was a cruel man, but I can't get past the Lamar I knew. Surely it's not completely his fault, I'd like to think that.\"—She glanced over at the coffin—\"And then, I can't help but think of how my mother was taken from me and all I can feel is hatred. Danny, I don't know how I should feel.\" He returned the small smirk and rubbed her shoulders, \"Well, I for sure can't tell you that. You just need to follow your heart, have a little faith, maybe.\" She chuckled, a rather strange tickle that could amazingly survive in the somber atmosphere, \"Faith? Isn't it a little late for that?\" Witwer realized his words had been turned on him, and Diana saw the true arrogant Witwer shine through as he straightened his posture replying, \"It's never too late for faith.\" And so they left together, hand in hand, stopping of course to speak to Celeste and give their respects to her once-noble husband. Witwer kindly helped Diana drape her rain coat around her and grabbed his umbrella as they began to exit the tent. But before they could walk out Diana felt a hand grab her good arm. Turning her and Witwer saw before them Anderton and Lara. She smiled coming forward and first hugged Lara, followed by Anderton, \"Nice to see you again, John; especially now that we don't have to worry about a price on your head.\" He smiled, though feeling rather awkward at how he should hug her back with her injury; he gently patted her on the back. \"It's good to see you too, though I'm happier to see you're still alive. Danny \"—Anderton emphasized the agent's name glancing over at his new found friend, Diana glad they had finally agreed to a first name basis—\"told me everything and I have to say you had us worried sick.\" \"Thanks for the concern,\" she mused, \"but you know it takes a lot more to kill Diana Warren—though I guess I should say Abigail Lively.\" Anderton smiled, \"It was good though, working together, wasn't it?\" She nodded, \"Wouldn't trade it for the world.\" \"And you're sure you don't want a secretarial job at our Baltimore Police Station? I could use a person like you to manage things.\" \"I'm sure. You know I couldn't just sit behind a desk the whole day, John. It's all or nothing. When I've completely healed you might get a call for a squad leader, but I won't settle for less.\" \"But Diana,\" Lara broke in, \"the doctor said—\" \"Who cares what the doctor said? I have foresight, I think I know my limits more than some ol' quack making assumptions.\" \"Yeah well,\" Witwer butt in, \"let's just remember that 'ol' quack' saved your life.\" Diana rolled her eyes. \"I just want you to live as long as possible,\" Lara explained, \"After all, I'll need someone to help me with our kid.\" She smiled, and Diana noticed a wedding band back on her finger. Folding his arms Anderton nodded, \"We'll see.\" Lara looked over at him shocked and aggravated, \"John!!\" \"Come on Lara, all I'm doing is giving a possible 'if'. That's all.\" Diana chuckled at their light-hearted argument. Thunder roared in the background. \"Well, we better get going,\" Witwer turned to Diana. She nodded. \"See ya John, Lara. Hopefully this won't be our last meeting.\" \"Oh, it won't. I'm expecting you and Danny to come up soon and stay for a little while. I won't allow you to leave me now after all that's happened. After all, where can my kids be without ever seeing their Aunt Diana and Uncle Danny?\"—He turned to Witwer and they shook hands. Diana could still feel a bit of tension between them, and as long as they lived they never were able to agree on much, but they became friends. And Diana was so glad she was no longer torn between two enemies—\"It's been, uh, intense working with you. You're one hell of a federal agent; I can only hope you show that much dedication in relationships. Take care of her, Danny. I'm trusting you to do that, and that's an order.\" Witwer comically stiffened and saluted, \"Yes sir, Chief sir!\" Anderton smiled. And for years to come, Danny kept his promise to the ex-chief of Precrime, til death did he part. They also followed through with visiting Anderton and Lara next spring, and visited many more times in the future, becoming as Anderton mentioned, family. ------------------ ANDERTON: Agatha and the twins were transferred to an undisclosed location. A place where they could find relief from their gifts, a place where they could live out their lives…in peace. As for Diana and Danny, they were married and moved to an isolated section of Washington D.C. next to the ocean where Diana could find peace of mind also, and Danny could remain close enough to continue his work as a federal agent . ----------------- The gentle ocean waves lapped softly as they repeatedly raced up the shore line, retreating back to its abode among the vast sea. It was warm that day, the sun shining merrily and the wind at bay, though it could still be felt coming from the East. Two or three seagulls hovered above the ocean, their cries mixing in with the music of the water, creating a soothing atmosphere. As Diana sat on the sand just beyond reach of the grasping waves she felt completely at ease as the water buried her bare feet in the grains of sand. Her hands were clasped together, hugging her knees as she squinted staring blankly into the horizon. As she had predicted, her wound healed well, and she was able to remain in peak condition, though cold weather or occasional rainstorms could bring back the pain sometimes. Anderton was a little hesitant at letting her onto his force, always saying: \"Let's wait one more year. Then we'll see.\" It had become rather frustrating really. Diana figured though, she was young, and she had the time. So she allowed Anderton to continue procrastinating. After all, Witwer many times would allow her to travel with him on his investigations, and she had become rather good at getting information from suspects. But as she sat there that warm afternoon, when all the cares and troubles of the world were behind her, she was not thinking of her lack of a job, not her past, not Anderton, and not even Witwer. The one thing on her mind was her sister. She would never be able to see Agatha again. Never could they reminisce on their childhood (if they could combine their memory enough to remember anything of their past), nor could her future child ever meet her true aunt. Her only sister would become a fading memory, a dream more like it. And the only thing Diana could see as she thought of her sister was the pitiful pale creature submerged in photon milk, her cold lifeless blue eyes staring dumbly at the ceiling. Her eyes did not even falter from their fix as Witwer sat down next to her in, surprise, a white t-shirt and swimming trunks. His hair wasn't slicked back and fell messily just above his eyes. Witwer didn't speak straight off, giving his wife a few extra minutes to finish her thinking. Instead he followed her gaze and watched the horizon. He would glance over occasionally, letting her know he was waiting for her to speak, but she didn't notice. \"Do you think the sun ever wonders if it's the only star of its kind?\" she spoke breaking the silence, though her eyes were still focused. Witwer shook his head, \"What?\" \"For years it's been there, in that one same spot as its energy slowly fades. Never knowing anything else, never seeing anything else. Could it forget its beginning? Even though there are millions upon billions of stars surrounding it, near or far, could it forget those that have been there for its eternal life, though they have long since died out?\" A slight smile came on Witwer's face, understanding what she was getting at. He draped his arm around her shoulder. \"Look at me,\"—Diana slowly turned her head to peer into Witwer's hazel eyes—\"Agatha will always remember you, no matter what. The same as you've been able to remember your mother. She may not be able to be here, but she will be in here,\" he pointed to his heart. Diana smiled, leaning her head onto Witwer's shoulder. He looked down at her as her eyes closed, \"After all, if the sun truly felt alone, who says that it wouldn't just get up and leave? All his loved ones are around him, some so far in the distance he can barely see them, but they still revolve around him.\" They were silent for a while once again, when Diana replied with a smile, \"I love you, Danny.\" \"I know,\" he replied. \"Hey Danny?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Would you like to know what will become of today?\" \"Sure.\" She smiled, \"me too.\" As Diana looked up at him, he gently kissed her. Breaking apart he held her in his eyes for a moment; it was finally all over, Precrime, Diana's gift, life had returned to normal. He chuckled, \"If only, right?\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own any characters or parts from the movie \"Minority Report\" nor am I affili"},{"Movie":"Phone Booth","Title":"Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target?","Author":"Trinn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1702526","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 1: The Simple Joys... Like Torture \"Hello Stu.\" \"What? How'd you know my na-- I mean, who's Stu?\" The caller on the end of the phone sighed. \"I'm not that dumb, Stuart.\" \"So who are you?\" \"That's not what I'm most interested in. What I'd like to know is your hair care secrets.\" The caller laughed maliciously. \"Well that's just too bad, pal, 'cause I'll never give away my hair care secrets!\" \"Ahah! So you admit to having hair care secrets!\" \"Uh... no, I mean, what hair care secrets?\" \"I don't have any hair care secrets! I didn't even know I had hair! Oh look, whaddya know, I've got hair!\" Stu laughed nervously. \"I swear, I've never seen this hair befo--\" \"Okay Stu. That's enough. You see that woman outside?\" Stu could see a middle-aged woman standing less than a foot from the back of the booth and staring in at him fascinatedly, and he jumped. \"Yes...\" \"Do you see what she is wearing on her stylish prune-colored hat?\" \"You mean the \"Hitler for President\" pin?\" \"No, no Stu, the other pin.\" \"...The little pink teddy bear?\" \"Yes. Do you see it?\" \"Duh. What about it?\" \"That little pink teddy bear will self-destruct in five seconds if you don't tell me what conditioner you use.\" \"But! But!\" Stu panicked. \"Can't we start with something smaller? Like shampoo?\" \"No, Stuart. Don't push me.\" Stu could see the little pink teddy bear on the woman's hat lift one arm and make a threatening gesture with one of its fuzzy little bear fingers and he shivered. \"Why me? Why not some other guy with nice hair?\" \"BeCAUSE, Stu, I like your hair best. Now, your conditioner!\" The teddy's yellow eyebrows slanted inwards, giving its beady eyes an evil gleam. \"Okay! Okay! I'll tell you! It's... it's...\" \"Come on now Stuart...\" The teddy frowned and crossed its pudgy arms across its chest. \"Pantene!\" Stu sobbed. \"I use Pantene ProV conditioner. Now call off your demented pink minion!\" The teddy bear on the woman's had suddenly burst into flame. Like a birthday candle. It melted down to nothing, frowning disapprovingly at Stu through the whole process. \"Scary, huh Stu? You see the people panicking? You see the crazy woman screaming because her hat has caught fire? No! She doesn't care. That probably was her least favorite hat anyway.\" The woman seemed oblivious to the fact that her head was on fire, but it must have looked uncomfortable to someone passing by because the observer whipped out her little cell phone and dialed 911, giving her fingers severe cramps from pushing the little buttons and then having to do it over because she accidentally dialed 9121 when her finger slipped. Cop cars were there within minutes. \"Captain Guy! Captain Guy!\" One of the anonymous members of the crowd caught the attention of the man in charge. \"The man with stylish hair in that booth over there -- he's got a flamethrower! He set that woman's head on fire!\" The rest of the random people passing by gasped loudly and suddenly noticed the flaming mad-woman. One of the cops sprayed her with his mini-fire extinguisher. She seemed fine, and started walking away slowly from the phone booth. She seemed to be muttering to herself. \"What's that you're saying, Smoky?\" asked the fire-extinguisher cop. 'Smoky' said a bit louder, \"The Recruit....Minority Report....Veronica Guerin....\" \"Gibberish,\" the fire-extinguisher cop explained to Captain Guy. \"I'm quite fluent in it. She says that guy has a flamethrower.\" He pointed to Stu and turned back to Smoky. \"Uh, SWAT....Tigerland....\" The woman, Smoky, nodded vigorously. \"Alexander!\" The fire-extinguisher cop took Smoky off to the side, murmuring, \"Hart's War?\" Captain Guy stared at them, then shrugged and turned back to face Stu's phone booth. He grabbed a megaphone and brought it up to his mouth. \"Attention! Yes, you, man with the nice hair in the phone booth! We know you have a flamethrower, and if you make any threatening moves to kill us all with it, we will put you on our angry-face list!\" He held up a piece of paper with a mad-looking smiley face at the top. \"But I don't have a flamethrower!\" Stu called back, still holding the phone in one hand. Captain Guy smiled and shook his head. \"Ah, the ignorant criminals these days,\" he said. He spoke into the megaphone again: \"Well, you OBVIOUSLY have a flamethrower or that woman's head wouldn't have burst into flame!\" He explained this to Stu very clearly as he would have a small child, or a lamp post. \"It wasn't me! It was the teddy bear! THE TEDDY BEAR!\" Stu cried. The caller on the end of the line, who had been laughing quite loudly, said in suddenly somber tones: \"Don't tell him about the teddy bear, Stu.\" \"Heh heh! Did I say teddy bear? I don't know why I said that! That's crazy!\" Stu yelled at the Captain, who lifted the megaphone to his lips, frowned confusedly, and lowered it again. Stu could see him lean over to his coworkers and mutter something he couldn't hear, and point at the tall buildings. \"This man is obviously insane. Now, I want YOU to go there,\" Captain Guy spoke quietly and pointed at a nearby building, \"and buy me a bean burrito.\" Inside the phone booth, Stu decided to give the caller the silent treatment. Unfortunately the man didn't notice since Stu hadn't said a whole lot anyway. After a little while in which everyone stared uncomfortably at everyone else and the Captain ate his bean burrito, the caller spoke up again. \"Alright Stuart, I think I've got enough information about your hair.\" Stu sighed with relief. \"Now I want to know... wherever did you buy those stylish shoes?\"[Chapter 2] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 2: BLEEPIN BEEEEEP BLEEP HONK After several minutes of what the caller liked to call \"persuasive language,\" Stu finally broke down and told the man what he wanted to know. \"Aah... those would be French manufactured?\" What followed next involved a tiny pair of scissors, Captain Guy's bean burrito, and Stu Shephard's stylish left shoe. This is how it happened: Captain Guy finally finished his bean burrito. He picked up his megaphone again and walked toward the phone booth a few steps. Speaking to Stu through the megaphone, he shouted, \"My marriage ended badly!\" Stu stared for a few minutes, then called back, \"And why would I want to know that?\" \"I don't know! I just thought it would make you feel better!\" \"Better than what?\" \"Better than I did after my wife ditched me! Here, let me go into detail...\" Captain Guy began to explain about his marriage but Stu was quicker. Faster than anyone could see, Stu knelt down on the floor of the phone booth, untied and removed his left shoe, and through it as hard as he could in Captain Guy's direction. \"Don't get any closer!\" Stu shouted. Throughout all this the caller had been suspiciously silent, but soon he spoke again. \"Sorry Stuart, I had to grab a bite to eat. That bean burrito just looked so good. But I'm back now!\" Stu spoke into the phone. \"Remind me again why I'm talking to you?\" \"Because you enjoy the sound of my voice so much. And because I have a rifle, which I forgot to mention before.\" \"... oh.\" The caller laughed. \"Yes, Stu! A rifle! Bwahah!\" He sobered a bit. \"Now I want you to do something for me. I know all I could possibly know about your outfit so... let's mess with your social life!\" \"Aw man, not my social life!\" \"Yes Stu! I think I'll begin by calling your wife and telling her that you've found someone else... me, in fact. Wouldn't that be a nice twist.\" The obviously masculine voice sounded quite amused. \"No! Don't call Kelly!\" \"Ah, so you DO have a wife!\" \"Wait a mi-- hey!\" Stu was furious with himself. But he was more angry at the caller. \"That's right Stu, I tricked you again. Don't you love that feeling?\" At these words something in Stu's memory jogged. He said suspiciously, \"Are you that guy I sold those \"Guaranteed Win\" lottery tickets to?\" \"No Stuart, that was my cousin. Phil's never been one of the bright ones... and that's not why I'm tormenting you, Stu, so don't get your hopes up.\" \"Then why ARE you tormenting me?\" \"Because I liked your hair. I thought that was clear.\" \"Anyway, Kelly time!\" \"No!\" But Stu could already hear another phone ringing. On the other end was Kelly's voice. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, Kelly, I'm calling about your husband, Stu...\" Stu yelled into the phone, \"Kelly! Don't listen! He's a liar, Kelly!\" \"Stu?\" \"Yes. In fact, he's listening to what we're saying now but you can't hear him.\" Kelly's voice sounded confused. \"But, I thought I just did hear him!\" The caller was silent for a moment. \"Sorry about that, forgot to push...\" There was a beeping sound. \"There.\" Stu yelled again, but this time Kelly really couldn't hear him. The caller went on. \"Anywho Kelly, this Stuart Shephard you're married to, he's been avaiding his taxes lately...\" Stu sighed with relief. Kelly did the taxes. \"...and he's just been arrested on charges of murder.\" Kelly sounded shocked. \"What?\" Stu said the same thing, only louder and followed by several persuasive phrases. \"Yes Mrs. Shephard, I'm sorry to say your husband is a baby-killer.\" \"No! Stu doesn't kill babies! A frog once, but that was an accident...\" \"I'm sorry, but it's true.\" The caller didn't sound THAT sorry. \"And before killing the baby, do you know what he did? He stole its candy! Right from its mouth!\" After ten more minutes of telling Kelly about the various crimes he hadn't done, the caller hung up and turned back to Stu. \"So Stu, how does it feel to be a baby killer?\" Stu, who was feeling distinctly grumpy by this time, replied in a string of threats and cuss words that didn't end until the caller cocked his rifle audibly. Stu's tirade ended with, \"And THEN I'll... eep!\"[Chapter 3] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 3: 555-HaHaHa Stu looked around, panicked. The caller's voice came, as calm as ever, from the black germ-encrusted telephone. \"Scary, isn't it. I love that noise.\" He cocked the gun again and Stu flinched. The caller, seeing this, laughed heartily and went into hysterics. Stu knew that, preoccupied with the violent hiccups and the increasing lack of airflow to the brain, he could probably whip out his cell phone and call someone without the caller noticing. Slowly he reached into his back pocket... It wasn't there! Stu felt his other pockets, appearing to dance to the onlookers outside the booth. People pointed at the funny man with the flamethrower and the nice hair and laughed. Stu eventually found his cell phone on the floor of the phone booth. This was an interesting development, because Stu had lost his phone on the Subway last week and it was beginning to come back to him when he saw it on the ground. Stu wondered how the heck it had gotten there, and he reached down to retrieve it. A bullet whizzed past his arm, grazing it and making a bloody streak on Stu's nice white long-sleeve shirt. He gasped and, grabbing the phone, straightened. The black phone booth phone was still in his hand, and Stu tentatively raised it to his ear to listen. On the other end of the line was still the hysterical laughter. Apparently the caller had accidentally fired without meaning to in his mirth. Cautiously Stu dialed Kelly's number. She didn't pick up, but her answering machine did. Stu left her a whispered message: \"Kelly! This is Stu! I didn't actually do those horrible things that guy said I did! .... I think his hiccups are getting better, I have to go, but you have to call the cops and tell them that I don't have a flamethrower or I'm toast! The phone number of the police captain is 555-3993, I want you to call him specifically! Quick!\" \"I heard that Stu.\" The caller was back to normal, and he sounded serious. \"But you know what? If she dials 555-3993 it will never work. Those are the sort of numbers they use in movies. They're not real!\" And there he went again with the hysterics and the hiccuping. Stu rolled his eyes and waited for it to be over.[Chapter 4] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 4: The Chipmunk with the Laser Eyes The crowd had thickened considerably from the beginning of the whole \"You have nice hair so I'm going to torture you incessantly\" fiasco. In fact, there were so many people gathered to see the flamethrower man that some of the small business owners began to set up shop right there in the street. \"Special today only! Flamethrower Man discount on all toy robots!\" One man had a bunch of little blue toy robots that walked and spun around whenever someone said \"Sticky Wicket.\" \"Come git yer illegal alcohol and cheap little plastic dealies here! Guaranteed made by all-illegal immigrants!\" (The owner of this small business kept getting weird looks from the police, especially Captain Guy.) \"Freaky chipmunks with lasers for eyes! Fresh out of the labs of the craziest scientists' basements! Cheap today in honor of that guy over there!\" Some silence followed this pitch as everyone stared at the little cages and their contents: tiny balls of fuzz that would occasionally blink and someone nearby would catch fire or lose a leg. But soon other merchants began haggling with various members of the crowd and the street became a marketplace centered around a guy in a phone booth who was believed to have a flamethrower. \"Well Stu, this is certainly an interesting development.\" Stu had almost forgotten about the caller. \"And you know what?\" \"What?\" Stu asked warily. \"I think those laser chipmunks are kinda cute...\" Stu groaned; he knew what was coming next. \"And I want you to get me one!\" \"For here or to go?\" Stu replied sarcastically. The caller laughed. \"Just get me the chipmunk.\" Stu sighed heavily and ran his hand through his lovely hair. \"Get a laser-eyed super-chipmunk for a crazy with a rifle... sounds simple enough...\" he muttered. \"Oh, and Stu, don't let go of the phone. If you did I would shoot you.\" \"Well that certainly complicates things.\" The caller laughed. Stu stuck his head out of the phone booth. As he was deciding what to say, one of the cops noticed and alerted Captain Guy, who was buying some illegal alcohol from one of the vendors. The captain looked up quickly and jogged over to where he could see Stu's head better. \"Hey you!\" Captain Guy mouthed, me? \"Yes, you with the illegal alcohol problem! Get me one of those chipmunks or I'll kill everyone with my flamethrower!\" Captain Guy considered Stu for a moment and nodded. He went over to the chipmunk vendor and appeared to buy a chipmunk from the man. The chipmunk-seller handed the captain one of the small cages, along with a large white textbook. The man waved cheerfully in a \"Thank you, come again!\" way and Captain Guy started to walk slowly towards Stu's booth. \"I've got your chipmunk right here,\" called Captain Guy. \"Why don't you come out and talk about it?\" Stu looked confused. \"Talk about the laser chipmunk?\" Captain Guy looked at him. \"If you want to...\" \"I don't really want to talk to anyone right now, I'm having kind of a bad day. Can you just bring me the stupid rodent?\" The caller spoke up. \"Don't let him get any closer.\" \"Stop!\" Stu yelled at the captain, who froze midstride. He spoke into the phone: \"Why not? How's he supposed to bring me your little monster-rodent if he can't come up to the booth?!\" \"Were you ever in Odyssey of the Mind as a child?\" \"...no...\" \"Obviously. Odyssey of the Mind teaches you creative problem solving skills.\" \"So you're saying--\" \"Figure it out.\" Stu thought for a moment, then stuck his head back out of the booth and yelled at Captain Guy (who was teetering precariously on one leg in the same position as he had been before), \"Toss it!\" \"What?\" \"Toss me the chipmunk!\" \"Are you mad? It'll kill us all!\" \"Either it or my flamethrower,\" Stu shrugged. Captain Guy looked doubtful, but he raised his arm to throw the chipmunk's cage. As he judged the distance of the phone booth, the chipmunk vendor noticed what he was doing and appeared suddenly by the captain's side. \"What are you doing?!\" \"I am tossing this chipmunk\" he pointed to the cage, \"to that man over there,\" he pointed to Stu, who waved. \"But the chipmunk will undoubtedly laserize the entire--\" but Captain Guy had already thrown it. As the chipmunk and its cage flew through the air, small red laser beams shot out from the little object and cut smoking holes in everything from shoe stores to the asphalt of the road to the crowd of people. When the lasers turned in Stu's direction he ducked, which was a good thing for him because the top of the phone booth suddenly separated itself from the bottom where he was crouching. At last Stu caught the mad little animal and held it carefully with its eyes pointed away from him. It seemed to be vibrating. Cupping the phone between his ear and his shoulder, he could hear the caller laughing delightedly. \"Okay,\" he said, \"I have your mad chipmunk, now what do I do with it??\" \"Hold it up where I can see it better... yes, that's good... Oh! It's so cuuute! Isn't it just precious, Stu? ... Stu? Say my chipmunk is precious.\" Stu rolled his eyes. \"Your chipmunk is very precious,\" he said in a flat voice. \"Now squeal like a girl,\" said the caller. \"What?\" \"You know... heeheehee!\" The caller giggled in a high pitched voice. \"Like that!\" \"Eheeheh...\" The caller sighed. \"Good enough, I guess.\" There was silence for a moment, and Stu's arms started to get tired from holding the chipmunk up. At last he said, \"...so, what do we do now?\" The caller paused. \"I suppose I could make you enact scenes from 'Gone with the Wind'...\"[Chapter 5] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 5: Party Games The rest of the day wore on as the caller made Stu stand in the street and sing songs from \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"Mulan,\" and \"Cinderella.\" He appeared to have a passion for the Disney flicks. Pretty much everyone had deserted Stu and left him to his fate after the chipmunk-tossing incident (the laser-eyed creature was now curled into a ball in its cage, nestled in the smoking remains of the phone booth), but Captain Guy still sat in his car and diligently watched everything that happened behind his dark sunglasses. The sunglasses in question were, in fact, so dark that no one could tell that Captain Guy was actually asleep. The sun went down and Stu began yawning. \"Hey, how much longer do I got to entertain you, guy?\" his New York accent finally coming through. On the other end of the line, the caller sounded like he was constipated, but he was really just trying to get the lid off a Gherkin jar. \"Rrrrng, just a second -- grrrrrr, nnnng!\" Then, finally, \"GAH! Hah! I got it!\" Stu didn't think he wanted to know what the caller had been doing. \"Now what was that you said?\" So Stu asked him again, slower this time in case the caller had suffered any brain damage while grunting like an elephant in labor. Then, \"I guess that depends on you, Shephard.\" \"Meaning...?\" \"I can make you do whatever I want for as long as I want and I plan to have a little fun with this.\" Stu lost it and started screaming hoarsely into the reciever. \"A LITTLE FUN?? Is this what you call A LITTLE FUN??!!?\" He went on to repeat some of the inappropriate words he had said earlier, only in a slightly different order and with a LOT more of the F word. \"Whoa there Stu!\" The caller on the other end seemed delighted at this reaction. \"Remember, rifle!\" Stu heard fumbling and then a loud clunking noise, followed by several scrapes, a quiet curse, an exhasperated sigh, and then finally, \"Well I can't get it all propped up again so I can't make the scary noise. I know, I'll improvise!\" The caller made a sound that was almost sorta like a cocking rifle. \"Now THAT was horror movie material! What did you think, Stu? Think I should remake 'The Ring,' only with more loud noises and an even more confusing story line? I think so.\" Stu was still out of breath from yelling, so he couldn't tell the caller what a stupid idea he thought that was. The caller didn't seem to mind this, as he babbled on and on about all the famous celebrities he had almost met, including Arnold Schwarzeneggar's estranged girlfriend's distant cousin's sister-in-law's former roommate. After an hour of this, Stu was almost snoring as he sat on the floor of the phone booth surrounded by broken glass. The sky was now jet black, but the streets were almost brighter now than they had been during the day because of all the neon lights. One lit sign said \"PHONE BOOTH INSURANCE,\" and it kept flashing on and off. Stu wished sleepily that HE had some phone booth insurance. When the caller became too hoarse to talk anymore, he ordered Stu to tell him a story. \"A nice story, with a romance in it.\" Stu's story was about a dragon who fell in love with an orange peel. They couldn't be together because all the other orange peels hated the dragons, and the dragons hated the orange peels. When the story was finished, ending happily with the dragon eating the orange peel so they could always be together (or at least, until the dragon's next bowel movement), Stu wondered if he could get it published. The caller's mind had obviously been drifting through Stu's heartrending tale of romance, because the first thing he said was, \"Truth or dare?\" His voice seemed a lot higher than it was before. \"Wait, what now?\" \"Let's play truth or dare! You go first. Truth... or dare?\" Stu had heard of this game. It was something his fifth grade girlfriend had kept trying to get him to play. He had always been more interested in the spin the bottle game. But he decided to play with this caller, since if he didn't he would probably get shot. \"Uh, truth, I guess.\" The caller giggled girlishly. \"Oooh, let me think... okay, which famous celebrity would you most want to go out with: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, or Keanu Reeves?\" \"... Do I really have to choose?\" \"I know, it's hard, isn't it?\" \"That's not quite what I meant...\" \"Well choose then!\" The caller seemed a tad impatient. \"Erm... Tom Cruise?\" \"EWWW!\" The caller shrieked happily. \"But you're a GUY!!!\" Stu, having already known this, was not surprised. He rolled his eyes and decided to play along with this maniac. \"Your turn now! If you were on a desert island, which of these would you most want to take with you if you could have an unlimited supply of that and nothing else?\" He didn't know it, but Stu was a born natural at Truth or Dare. \"Chocolate, pizza, or popcorn?\" \"Chocolate! For sure! But I can't have anything else?\" \"No, only chocolate.\" \"I want to have something else!\" The gun made a clunky noise in the background. \"Okay, okay, you can have one other thing.\" \"Three other things!\" \"Alright! Three other things!\" The caller seemed happy enough with this. \"Hmm, well then, I'd want --\" Suddenly the caller's high pitched voice broke off as if the phone had been snatched away. The caller reappeared two seconds later in his normal voice. \"Sorry about that Stu, I had to go to the bathroom and I'm babysitting my niece here.\" \"Ohhhh!\" That would make sense... \"Don't tell me you thought that was ME the whole time?\" The caller sounded highly amused. In the background Stu could hear the little girl whining. \"Of course not! I just... Of course not!\" Stu laughed loudly and fakely. \"Heh... heh...\" He coughed faintly. \"Uh-huh...\" The caller didn't sound very convinced. \"But moving on, Stu, don't you know all those famous celebrities you're always talking to on this phone out here?\" Stu started to sweat slightly. \"Oh, yes... those... famous celebrities...\" \"I want you to introduce me to the one called 'Pam.'\" \"But she's really a hote-- I mean, she's quite busy this time of night.\" \"Oh, but you always have the most interesting conversations with Pam that I conveniently happen to listen in to...\" The caller's amusement had a hard edge now. \"Yes, er...\" \"It usually goes something like this: Allnite Hotels! How can I help you? 'Hey Pam, it's Stu! You'll never guess who I met today -- Michael Jackson!' Hello? Would you like to make a reservation? 'Oh, I completely agree. That Michael! Such a tease.' Sir, do you need assistance? If you don't have business with Allnite Hotels then I'm going to have to hang-- 'Pam! I'm so shocked! You can't say things like that OUT LOUD!' Sorry, this isn't Pam, I think you have a wrong-- 'But Pam, I'm MARRIED! We can't do a thing like that!' ... click bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...\" The caller laughed softly. Stu's face was redder than the neon lights blinking chaotically into the empty street. \"You could hear... the other line?\" \"Oh yes, Stu. Have you told your wife you're pretending to cheat on her... with a hotel chain?\" \"Er, well technically I wasn't cheating--\" \"A HOTEL CHAIN, Stuart? And this Michael Jackson... what is he, a fish market?\" \"Hey, I have connections...\" Stu the PR guy sank down in the bottom of the booth and pulled his stylish coat up over his head, apparently afraid that the laser-eyed chipmunk, his only audience aside from the caller, would learn his most embarrassing secrets. \"Very impressive, Stu! You can't even connect your computer to the internet! Yes, impressive indeed!\" \"Well that's not my fault... the instructions didn't make any sense! They may as well have been in another language! It's all the fault of those idiot instruction-booklet makers...\" \"Stu, you were reading it upside down. And... you WERE reading the French section.\" For about ten minutes all Stu could do was cry. \"You're right, I'm worthless!\" \"Now now, I never said you were worthless. After all, you kept my niece entertained for three minutes. That's worth something.\"[Chapter 6] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 6: L337 5KILLZ The night hours ticked by slowly. When at last the sun began to rise, Captain Guy woke himself up from his comfortable doze, yawned loudly, and stretched his arms. One of his hands reached out the window and Captain Guy shivered when he felt the cold morning wind on his skin. He blinked blearily, remembering the previous day's happenings as he looked around at the empty street and the tired looking man stuffed into the bottom of a phone booth. He looked at the rising sun and wondered how long he'd been asleep. The coffee in the cup perched precariously on the dashboard of his car was cold, as Captain Guy discovered when he moved his leg and it spilled all over his pants and shirt. \"Piddlesticks,\" he swore, mispronouncing the common phrase, as he tended to do when flustered. He opened the door of his police car and jumped out, trying to wring coffee out of his clothes. Suddenly a bullet whizzed past his ear. \"Bammit!\" Stu blinked out of his tired daze at the sound of muffled screaming. He looked over and saw Captain Guy huddling in his squad car, mumbling something like \"Buck spit.\" There was a jagged bullet hole in the windshield. Stu was alarmed, to say the least. Had the caller finally given up his long charade and started to shoot at things in an angry rage? \"What are you doing?\" Stu shouted into the phone. \"So now we're shooting people??\" \"Hm? Oh. No. I was aiming for the air balloon, actually.\" Air balloon? Stu thought. Then he saw floating in the sky high above him and several miles away by its diminished size, a brightly-colored air balloon. \"That air balloon's no where NEAR that car,\" Stu said suspiciously. \"Well I WAS trying to do it blindfolded while in a handstand. I pull the trigger with my toes, you see.\" When Stu was silent for a while, the caller added, \"It's an acquired talent.\" Stu squashed himself a little more into the corner of the phone booth. On the ground beside him, the chipmunk's cage began to rattle. The chipmunk itself was emitting a high-pitched squealing and rocking back and forth on its hind legs. \"What's it doing?\" Stu asked nervously. \"You're asking me?\" the caller replied. \"It's probably hungry. You should feed it.\" \"...I don't have any chipmunk food.\" \"I can't help you there. You should have bought some off that nice scientist when you had the chance.\" \"Hey, he's your squirrel! YOU should feed him!\" \"Sorry Stu. I'm busy.\" \"What? You--\" Stu sighed, rubbed his hand across his eyes, and peered closely into the chipmunk's cage. It didn't look so much hungry as murderous. Its eyes were glowing red, but they weren't shooting lasers all over the place yet. It was growling faintly now as well as screaming like a teapot. \"You hungry, little fella?\" Stu asked hesitantly. He dug around in his pockets but came up with nothing except his car keys, wallet, cell phone, and a coupon for something called \"BeefStake.\" Experimentally, he held out the coupon. With the tips of his fingers gripping the thin paper, he stretched his arm as far as it would go. He didn't want to get any more of him than could be avoided near the cage that was now glowing faintly blue. When the chipmunk saw the coupon stretched out to it, it stopped shaking immediately and its beady eyes stared as the coupon got closer and closer. By the time Stu realized what it was really looking at, it was too late. The cage's blue glow suddenly got brighter and seemed to become fairly solid. Hundreds of tiny tendrils shot from the gathered light and gripped Stu's hand, which dropped the coupon as it was dragged, struggling, closer to the chipmunk. \"What?! What's it doing-- OWW!\" Stu yelled in pain as the chipmunk, arms outstretched to receive its meal, bit into his fingertip with a squelch. \"Very good Stuart!\" The caller was laughing heartily. \"You've found what it likes to eat!\" Stu was trying to pull his arm out of the mad vampire-squirrel's grip but not succeeding. The cage now seemed rooted to the ground and the blue glow was wrapped handcuff-fashion around his wrist. The chipmunk's eyes were closed in pleasure as it sucked all the blood it could hold from Stu's finger, which seemed to be much more blood than was possible for such a little creature. Finally it was done and Stu was released. He fell against the back of the phone booth, cradling his hand. \"Oww!\" He glared at the chipmunk, which was now lying on its back and wiggling its legs contentedly. \"Aw,\" said the caller from oh-so-far away in safety. \"I think it likes you!\"[Chapter 7] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 7: Lucky You It would usually be at this chapter in the story where the author would either be kind to poor Stuart Shephard and release him from the confines of his phone booth, chipmunkless, with all of his appendages in-tact for the most part, and send him home to have cookies or some other pleasant food with his loving wife; or, the author could kill Stuart and leave his body in a dumpster for the waste management to find in the morning. However, this will not be one of those usual stories. Instead, we're now going to have even more fun with Stuart as we explore the evil world of Reality Television. How it happened: Stuart's unique predicament was obviously causing a stir in the TV world, showing up on the news every day and causing people to bet on when he would die. And, since Stuart Shephard closely resembled Colin Farrell, the ladies in the audience began to form their own leagues of Stu-Lovers (much to the displeasure of their husbands, who were busy debating who would win between Stu Shephard and Spiderman). One of these Stu-Loving Leagues just happened to be a daytime TV station run entirely by lonely, single women. One of these Stu-Lovers came up with the brilliant idea to do a \"reality\" television show, in which real, live people compete for some fabulous prize on TV! (She was later informed this had already been done, but not before everyone congratulated her sarcastically for her brilliance.) But who should be on this show? The answer was clear! Who would make the audiences watch the very most? ... Of course it was Arnold Schwarzeneggar, but he refused, so they had to settle for Stu Shephard (who was originally their second choice). And he didn't really have a say, as he was currently trapped in a phone booth against his will by a psycho with a sniper rifle, so Stu it was. The television station managed to somehow (and by somehow I mean, \"involving a huge wad of cash\") convince the caller to let Stu off with only a warning and a year-long television contract to their station, and the caller did so willingly and happily, stopping by only to pick up his blood-sucking chipmunk and to give Stu a pat on the back for being \"Just so darn cute.\" Stu Shephard himself was having mixed feelings about the whole thing. On the one hand, he could have been stuck in that phone booth for who knew how long with a chipmunk sucking the blood out of his finger; on the other hand, which had no fang marks and was hurting considerably less, Stu was free of the phone booth with few noticeable wounds but was now under contract to do a reality television show for over a year. He couldn't decide which was worse. But when he saw the TV crew start piling out of their truck like clowns out of a VolksWagon Beetle, he decided it was probably the latter.[Chapter 8] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 8: Star Treatment The personal trailer that had been given to Stu as a gift from StuTV (someone had decided it would be a good idea, for whatever reason, to change the name of their television channel to reflect their newest attraction) was quite a bit smaller than he had expected a star trailer to be. And quite a bit less furnished. It didn't take him long to realize that it was actually a horse trailer, but by then he was being shoved inside by the brutish camera man and the metal door was being padlocked behind him. Stu pounded on the side for a while in a vain attempt to knock a hole through the unforgiving surface, but then the trailer (which had been hooked up to the back of the TV van) began to move and he fell backwards against the unpadded downhill wall with a thump. He briefly tried to gasp in the air that had been forced out of him as he slid down to sit on the thankfully-sanitary floor, feeling almost worse than he had in the phone booth. At least this horse trailer was BIGGER than the phone booth, and if it didn't smell quite as nice, at least no one was threatening to shoot him. At the moment. The van pulled into the station parking lot about a half an hour later, and in the search for a parking space big enough for both the trailer and van Stu was knocked around dizzily until he could no longer tell you for certain how many fingers HE had, let alone how many fingers YOU were holding up. Later he suspected the van had circled around so many times on purpose, perhaps to confuse him as to the secret location of the TV station's parking lot, for when they did finally park Stu could see out the holes in the top of his trailer how empty every other parking space was, which was extremely. The TV crew slapped high-fives for no particular reason as they all piled out of the van, then scuttled inside their station building before they burned in the sunlight as Stu, who had been left behind in his trailer, suddenly felt certain they would. After waiting for some time for the crew to come back, Stu decided he might be out here for some time and would survey his surroundings to see if anything at all could be used to his advantage. Empty parking lot. No help there. Across the street he could see a tall wire fence surrounding a dreary prison-like building and masses of muddy grass, as well as some metallic structures that Stu couldn't quite recognize. Some of them looked rather nasty and forbidding. It wasn't until around noon the next day when Stu discovered the true identity of the building across the street. He had slept badly that night in his freezing horse trailer, as, apparently, no one had thought to come get him, and he had finally really fallen asleep in the early morning when it started to warm up a little. He was awoken at 12:15 by three small, yet undeniably trollish, creatures who were brandishing knobbly sticks and red Twizzlers. They wore what looked like either prison garb or school uniforms, and were proved to be the latter when Stu saw the small badges on the left of each of their jackets reading \"Saint Fiacre's School for Trollish Boys.\" \"Hey horsie!\" called the tallest troll of the group, banging the side of Stu's trailer with his stick. Stu, who had only shown his eyes and the top of his head when he looked outside for whatever had woken him, sunk down farther until he couldn't see anything of them, but also couldn't be seen himself. Ignore them and they'll leave, became his hopeful mantra as the three boys circled the trailer and all began beating on it at once, yelling \"Horsie! Horsie! Horsie!\" as if performing a sacrificial ritual. This went on for quite some time, to the point where Stu's hair was even more ruffled-looking than before and he was wondering incredulously how much longer the little buggers could possibly go on beating his cage. It turned out that the only reason they DID stop was that they were interrupted by a StuTV executive out on a well-timed smoking break. \"Hey kids! Get away from there!\" The executive jogged slowly across the parking lot toward them, stopping halfway across the small asphalt expanse to catch his breath and then limping wheezily the rest of the way. \"Leave... horsie... alone...\" he gasped, hallucinating slightly from the tiring workout. The executive then had to sit down, cough a few times, and eventually pass out in exhaustion. Stu tentatively peeked through one of the holes near the top of the trailer, and saw with relief that the trolls were now becoming too preoccupied with the StuTV executive to remember the horsie. They hauled the executive up and carried him over their heads, chanting an ominous phrase that Stu thought must have been in another language as they scuttled back towards Saint Fiacre's across the street. Stu sank back down to the floor in relief, letting out a deep breath. His relief didn't last too long, however, as he was interrupted again five minutes later by a swarm of more television executives from StuTV. One of them opened the back of the trailer and Stu was yanked outside into the squint-inducing sunlight. \"C'mon Stu-- it's time for your first television spot!\" called one optimistic voice as bewildered Stu was pulled into the StuTV building by both arms. Once inside, he was whisked away to a small, brightly-lit room that was apparently used for slathering actors with various creams to make their skin look normal under the greenish studio lighting. Stu was slathered, then his hair was ruffled a bit more than was necessary (\"because the female audience likes that look\"), and finally he was led out into the studio itself. \"Oh... my,\" Stu said worriedly, recognizing the set before him as well as the three people seated behind a table draped with a blue sheet. \"Hello Stu,\" said Paula Abdul, smiling warmly at him. \"'Sup, dawg?\" said Randy Jackson. And Simon Cowell sighed boredly.[Chapter 9] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 9: By Popular Demand Once a week for about a month, Stu was sold off to the highest bidding reality TV show. He was becoming a sensation among people of all genders and age groups, eventually even internationally. But along with StuTV, another cleverly named television station was rapidly gaining popularity: SniperTV, which had dedicated itself to finding and celebritizing Stu's former captor. This task was harder than it sounded, as SniperTV innovator Karrigan Michaels soon discovered when she realized how much she and her coworkers at the station actually knew about the caller: one, that he apparently had a phone, or had access to a phone somewhere; and two, he possibly had some sort of mind control powers over chipmunks. This led to several very action-packed live shows that were sadly devoid of any useful content. Karrigan grew so desperate to find the phone booth sniper that she began advertising in the Personals section of the newspaper: \"SWF, seeking man with a tendency to shoot people in phone booths, preferably the man who was responsible for Stuart Shepard's brief stay in the phone booth with the chipmunks. If you are this man, or know anyone like him, call K. Michaels at...\" So now she was sitting in her executive office, tapping a pen annoyingly on an open copy of the newspaper and trying to think of a way she could BS her way through another hour of prime time TV without actually having a main character or any way to locate him. She sighed dramatically and pulled at her hair, possibly in hopes that her brain would be invigorated by the sharp, tugging pain and come up with a brilliant idea. The only thing it did was make her whimper as she blinked away sudden tears. Then Karrigan thought of the motto inscribed over the television building's front doors in Latin: \"Ut vos es defessus, taedium, ieiunium, tristis, vel gauisus... vigilo TV.\" (\"When you're tired, bored, hungry, sad, happy, itchy, or uninspired... watch TV.\" Or something like that.) So she switched on the television screen that took up a majority of the back wall. It was Stu Shepard. Gasp. He was sitting at the end of a very long table that was otherwise filled with an array of women, all of whom were laughing and giggling together and completely ignoring Stu. He appeared to be in a stupor. (It was how he often looked these days. Being an unwilling television contestant will do that to a person.) The narrator was a sarcastic guy with a slightly whiny voice. \"...but he will only pick ONE of these women to be his wife in the end. Who will it be? Will it be Marsha?...Will it be Franca?...Will it be Wilma?...Will it be...\" Karrigan smashed the POWER button in disgust. What was this, \"Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target?\" How lame was that? She grabbed her hair in preparation to start pulling it out again, but was stopped when her telephone rang. Surprised, Karrigan stared at the phone until it had rung twice more, then picked it up. \"This is Karrigan Michaels,\" she said automatically. \"Hello Karrigan,\" said the sniper. \"Oh... my... GOD!\" Karrigan yelped. \"It's you! It's you, isn't it! Stu SAID you sounded like Kiefer Sutherland on TV that one time.\" She paused. \"... You aren't Kiefer Sutherland, are you?\" She sounded worried. He laughed softly. \"No,\" he said. Karrigan breathed a sign of relief and continued screeching excitedly into the receiver. \"Oh my god! Ohmigod ohmigod OH MY GOD! So where are you? You have to come down to the studio! No, wait, we'll come to you! Oh, I'm SO happy you called!\" He snorted. \"It's what I do.\" \"Oh. Yes, of course. So where are you?\" Karrigan heard a knock on her office door. \"Not NOW!\" she yelled. \"Open the door, Karrigan.\" \"Oh...\" She got up, still holding the phone to her ear as if afraid to break the connection, and opened the door slowly. And there... Was Kiefer Sutherland. Holding a cell phone to his ear. \"Hey! You said you WEREN'T Kiefer Sutherland!\" \"I'm not.\" Kiefer Sutherland hadn't said a word. But she heard his voice on the phone. \"Wait,\" she said, confused. She stared at Kiefer Sutherland, who stared back vacantly and shrugged. He dropped his cell phone on the floor and watched it intently. The sniper laughed again. \"That's not Kiefer Sutherland either. He's too busy doing that show '39' or whatever it is now. I had to use a look-alike.\" \"But... why?\" \"There's a note for you. In his left pocket.\" Karrigan reached out hesitantly, but Fake Kiefer did nothing but stare at his phone like he expected it to grow legs and walk away, so she slipped her hand into his jacket pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. \"A crane! How pretty!\" Karrigan closed the door on Fake Kiefer and sat back down at her desk. \"I took an origami class,\" said the sniper proudly. \"Unfold it.\" Inside was an address. \"Where's this?\" \"It's where you're going to meet me. Tomorrow... at one o'clock sharp. Don't be late, I have to pick up my niece afterwards.\" \"I won't! I promise! I—\" But the sniper had hung up. Karrigan slumped in her chair, holding the crumpled paper to her heart. She was saved.[Chapter 10] Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 10: Meeting the Caller It was one o'clock. Karrigan Michaels was standing on a street corner, confused. She looked down at the crumpled directions, then up at the numbers on the businesses on either side of her. The address didn't match either of them! But why... At first she thought the ringing was a hallucination created by her frazzled brain. Then she realized it was coming from the phone booth behind her. Of course! She dashed into it and picked up the phone, slamming the door closed behind her. \"Hello!\" she said. \"Hallo, ees thees the Tie-lont Kefay? I woot lahk to ordehr ay leetle beeskit for me wahf, won of zem huhnie-flahvurred wons, plees.\" Karrigan slammed the phone down in frustration. \"Gah!\" Then she screamed and spun around as something bashed hard into the glass wall behind her. \"Tie-lont Kefay! TIE-LONT KEFAY! HUNIE BEESKIT! ME WAHF!\" A short man with bright green hair was throwing himself against the side of the phone booth, which rocked slightly backward each time. Karrigan cowered against the opposite side, jumping each time the man hit the glass. She slowly reached for the phone and dialed 911. \"911? I'm stuck in a phone booth and this guy is—What? No, this isn't a prank call! I'm seriously trapped in a phone booth—Don't you hang up on me!\" But they already had. Karrigan smashed the phone angrily back into its holder, then had to smash it into the holder again because she had missed the first time. \"Stupid 911, they never believe me,\" she muttered. (There might have been a good reason for this, since every other time Karrigan had called it HAD been a prank call, and now the 911 dispatchers had her voice on a tape labeled \"Prank Caller, Ignore At All Costs.\") Her frustrated thoughts were interrupted by another screaming of \"HUUUNIE BEEESKIIIIT!\" and a crash indicating that the short, green-haired man had broken the glass. There was a stunned silence for a moment as Karrigan and the Short Man eyed each other, then Short Man pulled a small Hello Kitty wallet out of his back pocket and held out five dollars. \"Hunie beeskit, plees?\" he asked politely. \"I'm sorry, I don't have any honey biscuits right now,\" Karrigan said cautiously. Short Man's eyes welled up with tears, and he walked away with his head hung low, occasionally looking back sadly at the phone booth with the stunned television executive inside. Said executive shook her head vigorously to remind herself that she was, in fact, still in the real world. The shaking finally produced a rather large headache and Karrigan stopped, dizzy. Then she remembered why she was here in the first place. She glanced down at the bedraggled ex-crane in her hand and read the address again. She looked up. \"Oh! There it is!\" She had been standing in front of the correct address from the start. \"How could I have missed it!\" Karrigan jogged to the door and looked around inside for the sniper. She cursed in disappointment at seeing no one, drawing furtive glances from an odd-looking group of people who had crowded into a corner booth and all seemed to be trying to hide behind various newspapers. Then something white on a nearby table caught Karrigan's eye. It was a paper crane. She grabbed at it eagerly and began to unfold it. Inside, in familiar handwriting, was what appeared to be... a grocery list. Karrigan squinted at it, confused. As she was trying to understand what the sniper might have meant by leaving her this message, someone tapped her on the shoulder. The waitress was chewing gum noisily and dangling a telephone in an indifferent sort of way from one hand. \"'S for you, I think,\" she said, and handed the phone to Karrigan. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, Karrigan...\" It was the sniper. Karrigan sat down hard in a chair and started to fan herself with the grocery list. \"I seem to have just missed you. And I meant to leave a note with the date and time of the next place I'm willing to meet with you... but I seem to have traded that note with my grocery list. It's a risk that comes with folding all my notes into cranes.\" \"Yes! I have that here! It's a lovely list, Mister Sniper, sir.\" \"Yeah, if you could just read that to me so I don't forget anything when I go shopping this afternoon?\" Karrigan read him the list, cherishing every item. When she was finished, the sniper gave her an alternate date and address and told her to really not be late this time. Then he hung up. \"Ah...\" Karrigan sighed happily, re-reading the grocery list. \"Hey, he gets Charmin too! I think I'm in love.\" ","Summary":" Who Wants to Marry a Sniper Target? - Trinn Chapter 1: The Simple Joys...

So... after a long, long while of fangirling and sorting out, I decided to write a fic about his character Gabe... almost two years after the movie came out. (facepalm) I know, but I had no idea what to write about until I was watching TV one day and watched this movie, then re-watched RR a couple of times and then came up with this. Such a bloody idiot, I know. Well, I guess now's better than never! Disclaimer: I don't own Radio Rebel. Luckily Disney has too much money to sue. \"This is your Radio Rebel, live from the Underground,\" I heard from the black earbuds in my ears as I laid on my bed, \"you don't know who I am, but I know who you are—because I'm one of you.\" This Radio Rebel chick is pretty cool, I guess. Everyone at school is freaking out about who she is and if she's in the senior class or whatever. I'm just gonna sit back and hear the magic in action. Why ruin the aloofness? \"Report cards came out today. I got a minus for participation. You can't give me a minus for being who I am. So, since grades are being handed out I think I should give all of us at Lincoln Bay High an F for labelling each other. Jocks, outcasts, dorks, queen bees and their fellow pops. And newborn pops. Guys, these aren't who we really are; there was a time when being different was a good thing. Now those differences just divide us, you deserve to embrace your awesomeness, embrace who you are. Reject the status quo.\" Rebel went on. \"I dare you.\" \"Well, hon, it's not that easy,\" I breathed, picking at my nails. With my twin sister, Zoe DiSentis, as Stacey DeBane's second-in-command, and my awkward yet lovable group of friends, Tara, Audrey, Larry, and Barry, rejecting the status quo isn't super easy. We all want to stick up for ourselves and be ourselves and let the crazy out, but let's face the dead, hard facts of reality: It's a death trap. The pops will always be in control, the nerds will be the nerds, the jocks will always be the jocks. It's just how Lincoln Bay works. It's the circle of life, and there's no going against it. Now, only if it was that easy to stand up for the poor, defenseless student body. But hey. At least we get our own tables in the quad! . . . . The next morning, I was tapping my drumsticks on the side of my locker as I listened to Audrey and Tara talk about last night's RR podcast. And all I could think about was my sister. Ugh. Both of us are short, like dead-ass four-foot-eleven or something. We both have lightly tanned skin, but she has dark and wavy hair that strides down her back with pride. Mine is dark, too, but straight with endless split-ends and a blonde streak running through it, just by my doll face. Since she's with Stacey most of the time, their outfits are coordinated, so it's skirts, preppy tops, and heels with matching handbags. I wear basically anything, but I'll fall on my face in too-high heels. \"I wish I could be like her...\" Tara sighed. \"Like who?\" I asked, bringing my drumming to an end. Audrey chuckled. \"There she goes. Was Kitty-Kat daydreaming again?\" she asked, giving me a look. I hated it when people called me Kitty-Kat. But it wasn't as annoying as Drummer Girl. Jesus, I know I play drums, you don't have to remind me. \"Was it about a boy?\" \"No,\" I denied, rolling my eyes. \"Don't even go there, A.\" She rolled her eyes at me, too, and faced Tara again. \"You should talk to your stepdad.\" \"What? Why?\" Tara asked with her eyes widened. \"Umm... he runs Slam FM, the biggest Radio Station in Seattle. Maybe he could give you an internship. That would be a confidence booster, right?\" \"Are you kidding me?\" she asked, totally doubting the idea. \"He's been married to my mom for two months, and he probably thinks I'm a total step-freak. I freak out when he asks what kind of cereal I want.\" I smirked, shrugging as I bumped my locker closed. Audrey closed hers too and we started walking. \"I just wish I could talk to everyone the way I talk to you guys. I guess that's why you're my BFFs.\" \" BFFTLEWE .\" I corrected, half-mocking Audrey. Tara looked at me like I had sprouted wings. I turned to Audrey, shaking my head in disbelief. \"She so doesn't get it...\" \"Best Friends For Totally Like Ever Without Exception.\" Audrey explained. \"Catchy.\" Tara shrugged. \"You need a relaxation technique,\" Audrery told her, \"When I'm rehearsing lines for drama, I imagine I'm breathing in the words.\" Once again, Tara questioned her mentally with a look. She looked at me, hoping I could translate. \"This is how I spend my weekends,\" I said, nudging her. I cleared my throat and did my best impression of her, \"You need to breathe your words...\" I exhaled in a voice creepy enough that it could be mistaken for Voldemort's. Audrey nodded like she was pleased. \"Pretty good.\" she said to me. \"How can you even breathe at a time like this?\" Barry shouted as he and Larry came behind us. \"Problem, Barry?\" I asked, grinning at his obsessive little crush on Radio Rebel. I remember he used to have a thing for me, but now that's obviously under wraps now that Rebel's in the picture. I feel sorry for her if he ever finds out who she is. She's gonna get random flowers and gift cards on her front porch, too. \"Last night, Radio Rebel revealed the biggest clue yet about her identity: She goes to our school!\" he went on as we drifted to the elevator. \"She mentioned it and then at 14:30 in Tuesday night's podcast.\" his \"twin\" Larry added for him as we fled in. \"You guys have way too much free time,\" Audrey remarked, \"Obsessed much, Larry?\" \" Obsessed ? Please, I would hardly describe myself as obsessive!\" We nodded as he took out a wipe and wiped the second floor button in a circle before pressing it with it. \"What? It's flu season.\" he said as he saw us watching him. The doors shut and lifted us to the next floor. \"It's so exciting. She's actually one of us!\" The dudes started selecting random chicks passing by who they thought was Radio Rebel. \"No dude, Radio Rebel is like five-foot-six to me and has red hair. Like Tara's,\" Barry objected, gesturing to the redhead. \"No, she's nothing like Tara.\" \"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?\" Tara asked, sounding affronted. \"Oh we love you... but you're nothing like Radio Rebel, who's definitely a blonde.\" Larry told her as he hinted to his brother. He had turned himself to him. \"And you know this how?\" Barry questioned. \"Radio Rebel is my soulmate.\" he explained in a duh tone. \"We're connected, like for example, I got a minus in participation.\" \"My God, you're so in-sync!\" I gasped, jumping up in fake excitement. I rolled my eyes again and threw one of the neon blue drumsticks in my hand in the air. They lit up in the dark, which was awesome. They were a present for my seventeenth birthday. I know, I know. Drumsticks, really? Hey, it's my birthday. \"How do we know that you're not Radio Rebel?\" Barry asked me. \"Maybe I am... maybe I'm not...\" I taunted, laughing. I poked his arm with the other stick. \"Whatchu gonna do?\" I turned my head over to Stacey, Zoe, and their little wannabe friend Kim. I snorted and rolled my eyes. My sister was the dictator of my life. She thought she knew more than me. She thought she was better than me. She thought she ran my life, because popularity just happened to have her in its clutches and not me. Snapping out of my memories, I now realized that my group was behind me, now in contact with Stacey and Zoe, and that wasn't very good. Especially in the morning. Ugh. Stacey's petty whining in the morning. In the middle of the week? Oh joy. I sighed and backed out of place and toward them. \"Well,\" I said with a grin, \"it's never too early for a fight.\" \"Stay out of this, Kat.\" Zoe hissed, giving me the evil eye. She had this whole signature evil eye going on. It said back-the-hell-off-or-I-will-destroy-you. I flashed a follow-up glare at her. \"You don't own me.\" I faced Stacey. \"Look, whatever's going on here can be solved with reason. We're all human here, not gods and titans on Olympus. We can work this out.\" Her cold blue eyes stared into me, like they were picking out bits and pieces of information from my brain and mind so that she could use them for torture in the future. And when she had my own sister to dish gossip on me, it was over. \"Oh puh-lease, Drummer Girl,\" she sneered. I think she was talking to Audrey now. \"No words. You don't think we're different? Watch and learn.\" She turned her head. \"Principal Moreno!\" The short, blonde she-devil looked our way and marched over, making me growl with anger. This lady had a thing for putting down the other students and glorifying Stacey and her group. \"Stacey,\" she greeted with a smile, \"is everything alright here?\" \"Actually no,\" Stacey sighed. \"Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some podcast in class. Of course I said no.\" This chick made Shakespeare's plays look dry and worn-out. \"What? No, I mean- I never–\" Audrey stuttered. \"You know that there's an anti-distraction policy. Let me see your bag.\" Moreno commanded, stretching out her hand. Audrey willingly gave her her bag and she searched until she fished out her iPod nano. Then, Moreno was a bitch and did the same to poor Tara, which set me off. \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Stacey.\" \"But they didn't even do anything!\" I protested, shaking my head. \"If anything, Stacey's her own distraction. She can't get enough of herself in the mirror.\" I gave her a snarky smile when she looked offended. \"One more word, Miss DiSentis, and I'll have you suspended... again .\" she warned, pointing at me. She snatched my Beats from around my neck, with my iPod touch trailing behind it as she walked away. I swore under my breath. \"Serves you right.\" Zoe said, rolling her eyes. \"Get it now? Your little DJ hero doesn't know what she's talking about.\" Stacey added in, glaring at me and Audrey. Tara stuttered. \"Oh! Does her royal shyness want to say something?\" Tara started stuttering more. I felt for her. She wanted to stand up to these bitches, but couldn't, due to her immense shyness and quiet nature. \"I thought not.\" Stacey turned to me. \"If you ever try and pull a stunt like that again, I'll–\" \"You'll what? Ruin my life? \" I asked in a mocking voice. I laughed, tossing my head back. \"It's already a shitload. If you ever mess with my friends again, that pretty little headband's gonna be stuck up your ass, Queen Bee.\" I threatened. She growled and marched away with her army of skanks. I could hear Zoe whisper, \" I can't believe I'm related to that freak. \" I shrugged and turned to Tara. \"You okay?\" I asked, rubbing her shoulder. \"At least you tried.\" Audrey complimented. \"Bye, Kitty-Kat!\" They went off to class. I pointed an imaginary gun to my head and pulled my thumb-trigger. Then I swirled around and started walking to Music. I cut down a hall when the bell went off, then I started running. I made it to the classroom in time and swung open the door, stopping to catch my breath. Giggles went across the room as my teacher, Mr. Forbes, turned around to look at me, unsurprised. He shook his head and marked me down in his book. Students got up and left. I mentally slapped myself. Music class was thirty minutes and started at 7:30. I could've made it on time if I didn't stop for coffee at Dunkin' Donuts. \"Miss DiSentis, come have a seat.\" Mr. Forbes said, pointing his pencil at the empty chair in front of his desk. I sighed and did so. \"I don't understand. In freshman and sophomore year, you were excellent. You actually put effort into your work. But in junior year, you started slipping. Now, you're at an average of 71. Can you explain that to me?\" \"I have a lot of things going on at home...\" I said, rubbing the back of my neck. \"Well, everyone has family drama, but that's no excuse for skipping five assignments.\" He flipped through his pages a couple of times and looked back up at me. \"You've been slacking in other classes, too. By the looks of it, you won't be able to graduate.\" My jaw dropped and my heart stopped. My mom was gonna kill me. \"But, I have a proposition for you. You need four more points to have a passing average, which will enable you to graduate. The final project of this semester is to write an original song with a partner, but unfortunately, everyone is already partnered up... except one.\" I leaned forward. \"Well? Who is it?\" He sighed. \"Mr. LaViolet.\" Screwed wasn't even where I was. This was the ultimate double-whammy. Either I repeat the twelfth grade or I work with the one person I couldn't stand. Decisions, decisions... What shall become of this you ask? You're just gonna have to wait until next Monday, dearies! Reviews, suggestions, expectations, comments, and such are welcome. Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 2] A/N: Thank you so much for the first chapter love, guys! Happy Monday! you know! now that most of us are out of school! it is a happy Monday. So, here's the second chapter. Question: WHO WANTS TO COME SEE FROZEN WITH ME? Disclaimer: I don't own RR, or I would've made out with Gabe already. No. No, no, no, no, no. No. Why, world? Why him? Why on this day? Weeks before prom, and then graduation. Why? Why, why, why? The problem was that if I paid attention in class, I could've blown off the project, but I needed every single credit I could get my hands on because I wouldn't graduate. Then, I'd have to repeat the twelfth grade. Then, I'd have to see Moreno's slapdash face again. Then, I'd be nineteen with the weird feeling of still being in high school. And all the torment and grief I gave the eleventh, tenth, and ninth graders would slap me in the face, so, it was either working with Gabe, or suffering social death to the fifth power. . . . . I was home, swiveling in a chair as I awaited to meet my death, Gabe coming over, as I was listening to Radio Rebel hopelessly again. I had an obsession. I must've been obsessed. There was a light knock on the door. \"Come in,\" I said, scooting toward my books on my desk and picking up a pencil. The devil walked straight in, shut the door, threw his bookbag on my floor, and plopped on my bed, laying down. Who did this guy think he was? Me? \"Excuse me, but who let you up to my promised land so early?\" I asked, dropping my pencil. \"Your mom. She was going out anyway, so she said just meet you upstairs.\" Of course she'd leave me alone in hell. \"So. What are we doing here? I have places I want to be. You're lucky I just wrapped up practice.\" \"Well excuse me , Your Majesty, I never asked you to come to my room.\" \"And I never asked your house to be next to mine, so I guess we're even.\" He shrugged, looking through the stacks of CDs against the wall. \"Coldplay, The Weeknd, Paramore, the Beatles...\" He held up a pink CD. \"Nicki Minaj?\" I got up and snatched it. \"Don't touch my stuff.\" I glared at him, but it died down when I realized he was a giant compared to me. \"Well, you don't look like a 'Barb' to me,\" he chuckled, lightly punching my arm. I tried not to laugh. I would not laugh. \"Yeah well... whatever.\" I sat back in my chair and brought out a notepad, tapping a pencil against it. \"Now, it's time for you to use that small brain of yours to help me brew up an idea. Let the storm clouds roll in.\" I said, turning to my desktop. Google was going to be my new best friend. \"So, I'm doing all the work?\" Gabe asked. I could see him behind me through the screen. \"Um, I said help, as in the two of us. Not just you. Not everything is about you, pretty boy.\" I rolled my eyes and rubbed my forehead, trying not to get a migraine from this dude. \"So you think I'm pretty?\" he asked again, grinning like the idiot I knew he was. I raised my fist and hit him in the chest, only making him laugh and stagger back. \"That's really flattering, Katrina.\" I gave him a dead look. \"What, did I strike another nerve?\" \"Three rules: Don't call me Katrina. Don't call me Drummer Girl. And don't call me Kitty-Kat. Got it?\" I smiled sickly and spun back around in my chair. I tried so damn hard to think of a topic, but gave up, groaning and spinning back around. \"All right. I've got nothing. You're more of a distraction than a partner.\" \"We're writing an amateur song, it's not like it's gonna be the next must-have single.\" . . . . Gym. Gym was outside the next day. I hated having gym outside, because I was an automatic mosquito magnet. I was rocking my navy-blue shorts though. A white tank top exposed very little of my chest by accident, my hair was up high in a loose bun, and my Nike's where on fire. I jogged faster and up to Audrey and Tara, who were taking their sweet time walking around the track. \"Look, at least you're talking to him,\" Audrey had said, talking about something I had no idea about, \"for you, that's major progress.\" \"I barely got two words out,\" Tara complained. \"Look, why don't you guys come to my house tonight. I'll teach the extended hyena pose I invented, and we'll listen to Radio Rebel.\" She looked at him, waiting for my approval. \"Erm... about that.\" I stalled, looking away. \"I... have an issue that I'll talk to you guys about later. But for now, keep going, keep going!\" \"I can't either,\" Tara admitted, sighing. \"What do you mean? It's Radio Rebel's first show at Slam FM! Do you realize how epic is? I mean, she was popular before but now the whole world will be listening. Including us.\" Audrey explained quickly. \"...\" Tara looked down. \"I have plans.\" \"What plans?\" \"Family plans.\" \"Whomp, whomp...\" I sounded, fanning myself. \"You know, you're not a pretty good liar, babes. Like when Audrey got that preferably horrible haircut at the mall and you said you liked it.\" \"It wasn't that horrible!\" Audrey argued. \"Yeah it was.\" \"Yeah, it wasn't that bad,\" Tara agreed. \"It was a mullet adjacent,\" I said with a dead look in my eye. \"Who does that sort of thing?\" \"Tell us what you're hiding, or I'll start screaming in three seconds,\" Audrey told her. Oh shit. I backed away, knowing that her fricken' screams were loud enough to blow up your eardrums. \"What? No,\" Tara said. \"Three... Two... One...\" Audrey let go a shrill scream, making me cup my hands over my ears and nearly tumble over. Tara slapped her mouth shut. \"Well?\" she asked her when she took it off. \"I'm sorry,\" she apologized, looking sincere, \"I can't tell you guys.\" \"I thought we were your BFFTLEs,\" I said, putting on a puppy dog face. \"Without exception,\" Tara added, shaking her head. \"Then, why don't you trust us?\" Audrey asked, sounding really hurt. Tara looked like she was about to explain, but then she turned and walked away, shielding her face away from us. I crossed my arms and watched her hurry off. Audrey looked at me, frowning. She shook her head and brushed my shoulder. \"So, what did you want to talk to me about?\" she asked, brightening her mood. I could tell it was fake, but hey, the day was still young. I blew air through my teeth and put my hands behind my back. \"See, there's this music project I have to work on,\" I started, \"to boost my grade. And... you know I take my music seriously and I love it.\" She nodded. \"But there's this one, tall, jerky, snide, devious little problem.\" I said the last part through my teeth angrily. \"... Is it Gabe?\" she guessed with a knowing smile. \"Yes. That son of a bitch,\" I muttered, dropping down on the grass, crossing my legs and pouting. \"Why me, above every person in the class? I know I got there late, but still! The fern in the back of the room could've needed a partner!\" Audrey giggled at my ignorance and crouched down next to me. \"You guys have been 'mortal enemies' since middle school. We're almost graduating, Kat, when are you gonna get over it?\" \"Never.\" \"I know.\" She stood up and smiled. \"You like him.\" My heart stopped beating, and I was pretty sure I fell trying to get up. My eyes bugged out of my head and my mouth hung wide open. \"You say what now?\" I demanded, stomping my foot on the prickly grass of the field. \"You like him!\" she repeated, teasing me. \"Kat likes Gabe, Kat likes Gabe!\" she sang like an eight-year-old. \"Kat's gonna punch Audrey if she doesn't shut up!\" I threatened, shaking her. \"I don't like him! Not at all, not ever!\" \"Sure... just wait until he asks you to go to prom.\" . . . . I'm a vegan. Just pointing that out, as I sat at lunch, mixing around my salad with a fork. Audrey still wasn't talking to Tara, hence the drama of her, sitting on my left, back-turned. Tara was on my right, trying to communicate with her by sending messages through me, which Aud basically ignored. I just gave up and put a fork-full of lettuce in French dressing in my mouth. \"You and me, Mr. Salad, are gonna get married.\" I said, crunching on it. \"Gavin, three o' clock.\" Tara whisper-warned. Ah. Gavin Morgan. He's cute. He's nice. He's sweet. But he's Gabe's side-man. His best friend, which was why I had a reason to hate him... Who am I kidding, we're like brother and sister, I can't hate that guy! And lucky for me, he was heading towards \"the G table\" with Gabe behind him. He looked at me for a bit, winking a little. I stuck up my trusty middle finger and waved it at him. \"Your three o' clock or my three o' clock?\" Barry asked, searching around. \"Or is it my three o' clock?\" I asked, trying to confuse him. He gasped and I laughed. \"We have the same three o' clock.\" Tara said, putting an end to our fun. Gavin started coming over to our table, making Tara's brown eyes pop open wide. Wait... did she have a thing for him? Aww! Cute! But... problem... I think... \"Oh no, he's coming over here. What do I do?\" Audrey hmph'ed in reply and turned her head back. \"For the record,\" she said, \"this is why you do't ice your friends out! Talk to him!\" She turned back. Gavin got to the table, leaning his hands on it. \"Hey, Tara. What's up?\" She gave a sweet smile, but fumbled out some words. \"So, do you wanna run lines this weekend?\" She gave a shrug and nodded. \"Or... we can mime lines, if you're not feeling particularly talky.\" \"She'd love to!\" I answered for her. Tara whispered some stuff and ended up fleeing, Audrey running after her. I sighed and propped my arms on the table. \"So, whatcha been up to, rockstar? Any new web hits?\" I asked Gavin. \"Yeah, we're working on some stuff. But you know...\" He shielded his face and pointed his thumb over at Gabe. \"He can be a little...\" \"Dick-ish?\" I asked, slowly shrugging. \"Exactly.\" \"Did you hear about our music assignment?\" I questioned in a high-pitched voice with a fake smile, making him laugh. \"We have to spend time together and like... work together and write this song for class. How sick and twisted is that?\" \"He's been talking about it.\" \"So wait,\" Larry said, looking confused, \"Kat's working with Gabe, and she hasn't blown up yet?\" He and his twin burst into laughter. I rolled my eyes and turned back to Gavin. I asked, \"What has he been saying?\" For some reason, I was curious about what this little douchebag was saying behind my back. \"He says you're stubborn. And lazy. And uncooperative.\" Gavin sighed. \"I know it's not true, but–\" I silenced him with my hand. I got up and marched towards the G table, slamming my hands on it. \"Who the fuck said that you can talk smack about me behind my back, LaViolet?\" I demanded, forcing him to look me in the eye. I stopped myself and looked up at the other two Gs, who never really talked much. \"Hey George. Hey Garrett.\" They nodded. I went back to screaming. \"So yeah... who the fuck said that you could talk smack behind my back? We've only been on this project for a day, and you really have the balls to do that? How bout I rip them right off?\" \"Stay out of my pants.\" Gabe advised snidely, smirking. I laughed mockingly and rolled my eyes. \"You're gonna come over to my house today, and you're not gonna say any shit the next morning about me being lazy and stubborn, got it? I was the one who did most of the work yesterday, remember that!\" \"Whatever's right with you, boss woman.\" I huffed. \"Later.\" I said to Gavin, walking off. No Internet poser is gonna talk about me like that. . . . . That night, I was in the living room, tapping on the ruby-red drum set my dad got me. Well... more like bashing. Gabe really set me off, and he sure as hell wasn't gonna get away with it, I can tell you that much. Zoe walked in the room, covering her ears. She started to say something, but I couldn't hear a single thing that came out her mouth. I held the cymbals and looked up at her. \"What?\" I asked, wishing she could just leave me alone if she was gonna dig at me again. \"Why is my ex-boyfriend waiting on our porch?\" Gabe and Zoe used to go out in freshman and sophomore year, but broke up in the middle of junior year because he wanted to start the Gs. Zoe got pissed off about it and said that being in a band was stupid, unless he was planning to become the next One Direction. He obviously thought One Direction was the most idiotic, girly thing on the planet since Justin Bieber, so they broke out in a fight. Then, le breakup happened, and she's been an uptight bitch ever since. And now I'm working with him. Talk about nice. \"He's here to work on a project.\" I clarified, heading towards the door and opening it to see him there. \"Finally, some service.\" he exasperated, rolling his eyes. \"I had the door slammed in my face. It's good to see you too, Zoey.\" \"Whatever. I'm going upstairs. Don't bother me.\" She pranced upstairs before I had time to give a fuck. \"Damn, she's colder than I remember.\" he scoffed, following me up to my room. I shut the door and sat at my computer. Oh God. Radio Rebel was about to come on Slam FM and I was about to miss it. I quickly tuned in my alarm clock to the station. \"Oh come on! You listen to her, too?\" \"She's God,\" I explained, smiling. \"This is Radio Rebel, live from Slam FM. Listen. I gotta confess,\" my radio said, \"moving the show from my bedroom to Slam Studios was a bit terrifying, but life's all about change, right? Maybe some people just wanna label you as one thing.\" I nodded my head in agreement and thought one thing. The fact that every idiot in school labelled me as Zoe's Weird Sister or Drummer Girl. \"Like, that kid with the remote-control car. Maybe he's gonna grow up and invent the first all-green rocket ship. And that girl who gives everyone carnations on Valentine's Day, just so no one feels left out. Maybe she'll grow up to be president.\" I almost fell out of my chair when I heard the last part. \"... And Kat DiSentis, the 'Drummer Girl,' who obviously... well... plays the drums and taps her sticks in class all the time. Maybe she'll grow up to be an amazing drummer in a hit band, touring all over the world.\" Gabe coughed, having no faith in it. I tossed my phone at him to make him shut up. My stomach was in a knot and I felt ecstatic! Radio Rebel just friggin' talked about me on the radio! Holy shit! \"Guys, if we just drop the labels and cliques and be ourselves. We have no idea what we're capable of. Okay, if you're with me on this... wear red tomorrow. It'll be like saying, 'Despite our differences, we're in this together.' This next song is by Red Letter Day.\" The song filled my room as I had a fangirl moment. I screamed and jumped up, flicking my hands and nearly crying. She's. My. Hero! \"Why are you spazzing out? She said maybe .\" Gabe teased, trying to put my mood down. \"She said my name. She knows me!\" I was tempted to do a cartwheel. He snorted and gestured down to a beat-up notebook. \"Oh... right, sorry. Back to the song.\" Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I don't own any rights to Radio Rebel. :( Red leather jacket, red earrings, red nose piercing, and red sneaker wedges. Yup. I was prepared. The next day at school, there was a sea of people dressed in something red. It was awesome. One, single chick convinced a whole student body to wear one color. Even Zoe had left the house wearing red, and she would probably get grief from Stacey. I met up with Audrey, who was definitely rocking red, too, and we walked up to Tara. \"Ahem,\" Audrey said, swiping her attention, \"like my glasses?\" \"But, you have freakishly good vision.\" Tara pointed out. She shrugged. \"Fashion shouldn't be functional.\" She showed how they didn't have any lenses. I nodded, impressed. I can be fashion-savvy at times when I'm not being a complete potty-mouth. \"Do you know why I picked red rims? I assume you do, because of your red shirt.\" We scanned Tara up and down. Mhmm. Red shirt, blank face. Guilty ! \"Can you believe Radio Rebel said my name on the air yesterday?\" I awed, still dumbfounded by the fact. Audrey smiled shyly in response to me, but keep her mood low for Tara... It was like a World War in our very own friendship. Larry and Barry came into view in the elevator, decked out in red with matching plan shirts, jackets, jeans, sneakers, laces, and hats. \"Can you tell us apart?\" they asked in unison. \"You guys are fraternal,\" I scoffed, \"not identical. Sorry to burst your bubble.\" I made a pop noise and poked my finger above their heads. Audrey rushed into the elevator, moving herself away from Tara. I had to go to her side, or else she'd totally pull an Audrey and dramatize how I was picking sides... well... technically, I was pissed at Tara, too, but if she wanted to keep something to herself, it was fine by me... It's kind of like a Team Switzerland kind of thing. We soon elevated to the next floor and walked out. My arm with looped with Audrey's as we filed out. \"We just ran a recording of Radio Rebel's show through a voice analysis app,\" Larry said excitedly. He's such a geek, it's cute. \"We're closer than ever to uncovering her true identity.\" \"Picture it,\" Barry said, \"'The Cole Twins Crack Radio Rebel's ID.'\" \"If we do, then I'll be able to profess my undying love.\" Larry added hopelessly. \"We'll be famous. We could get a reward or at least our own reality TV show.\" \"Sure, I'd love to watch 'Two Geeks, One Dream.'\" I told him, dying of laughter. \"Seriously, though, you guys would be fun-ny.\" \"And she and I could be married on live TV...\" Larry sighed again. They turned to Tara, eyeing her down. \"Tara,\" he sang, \"since your stepdad runs Slam FM, maybe you could help is out?\" She replied, \"I'm no allowed to go to Slam FM while she's there, to keep the mystery... mysterious.\" \"The truth is,\" Audrey spoke up, \"Tara doesn't have time to do friend-related things. C'mon, Kat.\" She started to drag me away with the amazing upper-body strength I had no idea she even had. Tara quickly followed, calling out Audrey's name in a hushed voice. \"What?\" she snapped. Tara stuttered, then shut a classroom door, probably so no one could hear what she was about to say. Ooh, is she telling us her secret? She faced us, still stuttering. \"Forget it, I'm leaving.\" With her still attached to me, I yanked her back. She shook her head and I gave her a knowing look. This might have been our only shot to get her to spill her secret. \"I'm about to tell you both something so top-secret, you have to promise not to repeat it to anyone.\" Tara finally said. We looked at each other and nodded. \"I swear on my cat's grave.\" I responded, saluting her. Tara stalled by murmuring something. Audrey got fed up and exclaimed, \"Tara, remember! You have to breathe your words!\" She murmured it again, only a smitch louder. \"Breathe your words!\" we said together, sounding desperate and demanding. \"I'm Radio Rebel.\" Tara stated. \"Umm... what?\" I asked, tilting my head. . . . . \"If you're like me, and believe music can change the world, one track at a time, you're gonna love this new track from my new favorite band.\" Tara said, speaking into a headset, coming through the speakers as Rebel's recognizable voice. I left Audrey with the headset. After school, Tara insisted she was Rebel, so she dragged us over to her house to prove it. We were in her bedroom now. \"What. The...\" I felt like my words were twisted and tangled, jumbled up in my stomach and coiled in my throat, struggling to come out. I was having a heart attack. I was having a spasm. Tara Adams... Radio Rebel... does not... compute... \"Holy... Wha... Huh?\" My eyes were stuck in a bulging state and my mouth was frozen in the same form. \"I can't believe she's you... or you're her... I mean, you're the last person I'd expect to be Radio Rebel, Tara!\" Audrey said, probably not as shocked as I was. \"It's been driving me crazy not telling you guys,\" Tara admitted. \"and of course I've wanted to hang out, but I've been doing the show. Here's the thing. You can't tell anyone. Not even Larry and Barry, because Slam wants to keep it this big secret... and so do I.\" We squealed and joined in for a hug. \"We're sorry we didn't believe you.\" Audrey said, speaking for both of us. . . . . Okay. Oh. My. God. Wow. What an evening. And it's about to get ten times more shocking. Wait for it... when I got home, on my porch... sitting in a wicker chair... was my mother. Gasp, I know! And guess who was sitting next to her, smiling and laughing and talking with her... Gabe. Wow. My heart attack saga just keeps getting bigger and bigger. \"Um... hey, Mom.\" I said, nervously, walking up the steps. \"What are you doing home?\" She coughed for a minute and looked up. I hate to admit it, but I missed seeing her weird, light brown eyes. \"I decided to stay home for the night. We haven't talked in a while... and when I got home, Gabriel was on the front porch, waiting for you, so, I sat down and we started to catch up.\" Her voice sounded awful. All raspy and croaked. But my mom was beautiful. She had dark hair like me and Zoe, a small, curvy body, and an innocent face. She looked all exotic with her olive skin and long hair. Gabe said a simple, \"Hey,\" with a head nod. I rolled my eyes. \"Whatever. Mom, if you don't mind, we're gonna work on our project now.\" I excused, making him get up. \"Don't stay too long.\" I heard her say as I walked up the stairs, going into my room and sitting there, face-palming. \"She smells like cocaine.\" Gabe told me, sitting... next to me on the bed. I scooted away and nodded. \"Does she smoke?\" I nodded, a little embarrassed that a person who wasn't even close to my friend could see my mother like that. \"Does she know you know?\" \"Look, can we just work on the song?\" I asked, grabbing my notepad and a pencil. He shrugged, leaning over my shoulder to see what we had down so far. Wait a minute, this wasn't our song, dammit! I tossed the notepad away. \"Wrong thing, sorry.\" He went to fetch it and read off of it, making me sink my head in embarrassment yet again: \" It's be four years, already? The other day was freshman year. I wanna call it, being steady But it's just so much more. \" I snatched the pad from him, my cheeks burning red. He actually looked excited. He loosened my grip and took back the paper, continuing to read it: \" I can't explain what you do You're too complex to describe Just hold me, don't break me, and gently- \" He smiled wider, looking at me. \"It's nothing.\" I lied, looking away. \"It's just... gibberish! Really.\" \"It's girly, yes, but it's good. You should totally sing this in class. Screw my grade.\" he went on, talking complete and utter crap. \"No! Screw it, no. We're working on our song, not this piece of shit I wrote late the other night, okay?\" I stared up at him and he nodded solemnly. I went found our song in the notepad. It was a little hard to agree with him on a topic, but not impossible. We weren't doing a party song; we weren't doing a country song... When I realized what song we were writing, it felt so freaking weird... If I could have just one simple wish It'd be to have you, closely like this And if I could change the world in a snap I'd be the one to bring you right back I can't even deny The feel is so right and My hear can't beat anymore... Cause oh! I cannot live anymore Without you, my head's kind of sore My arms have no one to love My lips have no one's to touch Cause you, you're just too much to bear I just want you right there By me, so brightly, so I can see What I'm missing here~ A love song. But... it was kinda good... . . . . All right. The next afternoon, (yeah, I know, I totally skipped the school day!), was kind of insane. Or insane is an understatement. So... first off, Gabe had invited me over to his house to watch his band play... Why? I dunno, just stay with me here. So, there I am, listening to Miss Radio Rebel, aka my best friend Tara, swaying my head with my earbuds in my ears, while Garrett's fixing up his drums and George is plugging in an amp when something unusual and amazing happens... \"You guys at Lincoln Bay High killed it yesterday with the red,\" Tara said, \"I noticed one of you wearing these red specs that were the epitome of cool. But can we talk about what's not cool for a second? I mean the school keeps confiscating our stuff, I mean I've lost two sets of headphones and an MP3 player just this term alone. One girl nearly lost her neck getting her brand-new Beats taken away with her iPod touch! Although I did notice some of us seem to be exact from this little stuff snatching epidemic. Funny how that works, huh? Guys it's not just out playlists and players we're being deprived of 'ya know? Music is the soundtrack to our lives! It's where we've been and where we're going and everywhere in between, our music is who we are. Are we gonna let someone just snatch that away from us? Or are we gonna change the game?\" \"Hell yeah we will!\" I screamed, drawing the boys' attention. I flicked them away and went back to listening to Tara. \"Here's a new song about trying things you never thought you could. Look, I've been trying to do a bunch of new things lately, and this song severely inspires me. So, check it out. Vibe it. Really, really dig on it... and then, remember that feeling. Tomorrow, at 8 a.m., stop what you're doing, get up, and dance! Just express yourself! Let yourself out. This is Turn It All Around by The G's.\" I dropped my iPod and screamed, defiantly attracting the three G's. \"Drummer Girl, what the hell's your prob–\" I cut Gabe off by yanking out my earbuds from the iPod and letting their song blast in the cluttered garage. His jaw dropped and the other two wore goofy smiles, high-fiving. \"You're on the radio, pretty boy!\" I announced if it wasn't clear. He laughed like he didn't believe it. \"Oh my God! This is huge!\" His eyes were wide and he grabbed me by my waist, swinging me around as we laughed... I actually didn't feel hatred towards him right now... I was happy for him... Maybe that wouldn't last. Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own RR, or any rights to it. When it was 8 a.m. on the dot, I got up and ran through the halls, dancing and screaming along with some other kids in our class. We were jerking and flipping and dancing and doing some things I wasn't pretty sure was legal in the rules of dance. I ran into the Drama-English classroom and joined Audrey. \"How'd you get in here?\" she asked me over the music. \"I broke in!\" I told her, twirling her around. I noticed Tara was slightly dancing with Gavin... until Stacey did some kind of crazy-ass moves in between them... Weirdo. Audrey and I giggled but then stupid Moreno came on the PA, killing all our vibes and stopping the music. \"This is a place of leaning, not dancing. Anyone listening to Radio Rebel during school will be suspended. And Radio Rebel, I advise you to turn yourself in now, or your future will be Radio Silence.\" \"Aww. Gotta get back to Math.\" I told Aud, waving and skipping backwards out of the room. . . . . At lunch, Mr. Famous himself came to talk to me... Audrey made a heart with her fingers and I hissed at her, making leave. I sat on top of an empty table with my foot on it, and he sat next to me... a little too close... so I moved away a little. \"Hey.\" I said, feeling awkward. I was in a newborn pop's presence, now, and it didn't feel good... not at all... \"Sup, DiSentis.\" he replied, smirking. \"I saw you running through the halls this morning. I'm surprised Moreno didn't expel your ass already.\" I shrugged giving a goofy grin, but then wiped it off. \"So, about our song, I just wanted to run over it, 'cuz I think we're done, right?\" I shrugged again and rummaged the notebook out of my bag and into my hands. We read over the first verse and then the chorus, then moved onto the second verse and the bridge: \"All we have to work on is the melody a bit more, and the bridge, of course. Then, the harmonies...\" I said, shrugging. It turned out pretty decent. But I hate the fact that it's a love song. I mean, I think we were gonna write a party song in the first place, something maybe dance-songy and preppy, but then it turned into... this. But, I'll take anything I can get. I've gotta pass, right? \"So. After all that, I'm out of your hair. I guess we're both pretty happy. See you around, Guitar Dude.\" I got up to leave, but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back down. \"Well... we've gotta go over it... like... actually sing it.\" Gabe stuttered. Wait. Gabe stutters? His words usually just come flying right out of his mouth with no regrets. \"See, you're lazy. You just wanted to leave it like this. Check your facts, Drummer Girl.\" I winced and sighed. Dammit, he was right. We couldn't just leave it like this and expect ourselves to remember how it goes. \"Fine. We'll go over it. But don't think I'm enjoying myself, because I'm not.\" \"Ha-ha. Like I cared.\" I got up, grabbing my stuff and running off when the bell rang, ending lunch. . . . . The next lunch was pretty psycho. No, I mean psycho in a good way. It felt like our very own High School Musical. That's how good it felt. I heard music. Music blasting from the front of the school building. I smiled and ran out with a load of other students to see a colorful van, courtesy of Slam FM parked in front of our school, with amps on the top, showering us in music. And the one and only Cami Q, my DJ icon swung out from the van with a mic. I think I peed myself. Cami Q is a legend. Cami Q was awesome. Cami Q... was at our school! I raced to the front of the crowd to hear her loud and clear. \"Hey, hey, Lincoln Bay!\" she said. \"This is Cami Q coming at you live. Y'all feeling good today?\" I was one of the loud people who screamed. \"All right, listen up. I got a special message from my good friend, Radio Rebel.\" She put her arm in the van's window and \"Radio Rebel\" started talking, but I saw Tara back at the school with Audrey. \"This is Radio Rebel, coming at 'ya with a little lunch time surprise. Now, a lot of you guys have IMed and texted me about the powers to be taking away our music, and it feels like part of ourselves are being taken away.\" We booed. \"That's not gonna make us better students, and you can't punish someone for relaxing during their down-time, right, Principal Moreno? You stole our music, and I'm giving it back. Text in requests. Lunch time is our time!\" The music started up again and I raced to Tara, laughing. \"Oh my God, why are you so awesome?\" I demanded, jumping up. . . . . As soon as I got out the bathroom, I saw Zoe talking to Stacey, Kim, and Moreno. Ugh. Not a good. Sign. Moreno wandered off and Zoe pointed me out, coming towards me. I ducked my head and started nonchalantly walking away, but I was grabbed by her and brought to Stacey. Her beady little blue eyes were staring me down. I raised my eyebrow and pursed my lips, staring right back at her. \" What is this?\" she demanded. She held up a paper of prom princess court or something like that. For prom king, I only saw Gabe and Gavin, which was no surprise, but for prom queen, there was Stacey... Radio Rebel? And... My jaw must've dropped low like an anvil in a cartoon. Me... \"I don't know, you tell me.\" I said, crossing my arms. Zoe hit me. \"You're nominated for prom queen! How is that possible?\" \"Maybe guys just find me attractive.\" I grinned, fluttering my eyes innocently. \"Yeah, if they were gay!\" Stacey snapped, rolling her eyes. \"You're going to drop out! First, it's that Radio Babble! Now, it's you! You, you stupid Drummer Girl!\" I cringed and pretended I didn't just hear that. \"You're going to drop out.\" \"Well, maybe I want to be prom queen.\" I threatened with a smile. \"Maybe I want to accept your crown, hmm, Stacey? Where's the harm in that? I'll be the first non-pop ever to win prom queen.\" I snickered as her face reddened. \"You're dropping out.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"No.\" \"Yes!\" \"No!\" \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"No!\" She groaned a scream and marched off, infuriated with me. Kim dumbly followed and Zoe sashayed off also, not daring to look at me. I wore a smug smile, holding myself. Holy crap. I was nommed for prom queen. . . . . \"So, you and Tara– er... Radio Rebel are nominated for prom queen.\" Audrey stated in disbelief as we drove in her car to Slam Studios. Apparently, yes, Tara/Rebel was a prom court princess, too. But all hell would break loose if she accepted that crown. She would probably be expelled. But hey, there's the chance that Gavin might win, so they could've had the first dance together! Aww! But, erm... I'm nominated for queen... and God-forbid I win, but if I do... and Gavin loses... that means that Gabe'll be king... and we'll be dancing... together... touching... standing close to each other... Gross. \"Yup. I'm pretty sure some idiot rigged the voting, because why would anyone vote for me?\" I asked, laying in the backseat. \"Let me see. You're beautiful, you're funny, and you're a piece of work.\" \"Check, check, and check. Still. Why? Unlike Tara, I'm not the leader of the music revolution.\" \"I-I wouldn't call it a revolution...\" Tara said, looking out the window. \"So, how are things going with Mr. Popularity?\" Audrey asked me, digging at Gabe. I groaned in response. \"That bad?\" \"Well... not exactly... he's... being a little nicer... and we've almost finished the song, we've just gotta go over it with vocals and stuff... I just hope all this time together is worth it, because dammit, I can't stand it! I better get at least a B!\" I complained, tossing a drumstick in the air and catching it. I tapped the seats again and sat up as we reached Slam. Weirdly, Tara suggested that we park in some distant place, way~ far away from Slam itself. We had to put on trench coats and wigs as we snuck inside, then we deserted them and walked into Rebel's recording booth, where it was crazy cool. I felt like I was in heaven as I sat myself down in a lounge chair, putting my hands behind my head and relaxing. \"Is this the famous Audrey Sharmah?\" a voice asked. It was Cami Q. I jumped up and straightened myself out. \"And the feisty Katrina DiSentis?\" My mouth fell open as I stared at Tara. \"She likes to be called Kat.\" Tara corrected, smiling. \"Yes, it is, in the flesh! You can call me anything you like!\" I announced, drawing my arms out to let everyone behold my awesomeness. The door opened and in walked Tara's stepdad, Rob I think his name was. \"Could you girls excuse us for a moment?\" he questioned. We all fled out the room, shutting the door behind us. Cami turned to us, smiling. \"Do you guys want a quick tour?\" she asked. \"Um, yeah!\" I shouted, pounding my fists up in the air. Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I don't own Radio Rebel. :( \"A lot of you... wanna know who I am. I get, that,\" Tara said, speaking into the mic from her area. Audrey, Cami, and I were in the littler room, \"maybe it would be easier if you could see my face... but that's the thing. Guys, it's not about me. It's about you. So, you don't need to know my name. You wanna know who I am? I'm somebody who's tired of being afraid! I know who it can hold you back. So, say it loud, just say what you're afraid of. Call in. I dare you.\" I guess Tara's mini-speech flopped, 'cause there were no call-ins. Then, I looked down when Cami nudged me. I looked down at her laptop, excited to see all the green lights flashing. \"I guess everyone's too afraid to say what they're afraid of... Maybe this song will inspire you.\" I knocked on the window, getting Tara's attention. \"Lines one through twenty!\" I said. A bunch of random calls went in, like Larry and Barry for example... those two are hilarious though. Hands down. But at the end... there was Gavin. Which caught us by surprise. He said, and I quote, \"I'm afraid of doing my own thing.\" \"I was too.\" Tara said. \"Was? So, what changed?\" he pondered. \"I guess I started doing the show, and I realized you're not as alone as you feel. If you can remember that, it would be easier to take a risk. Do your own thing.\" she suggested. I gave her a thumbs-up. \"Yeah, thanks.\" He hung up and I squealed. \"We're gonna take some more calls in a minute. In the meantime, you guys are seriously gonna dig this next song.\" She played it and stood up, turning to leave. Aud and I came out the little room and into the big room, taking off our borrowed headsets. \"Hey, where are you going?\" Audrey asked. \"Just somewhere to do... something.\" She left. She's so vague! \"I'm afraid of hyenas!\" Audrey suddenly shouted, scaring me. She sighed with relief and looked over at me. \"What are you afraid of?\" I humph'ed and rolled my eyes, putting my hands on my hips. \"Umm... I guess you could say that... I'm afraid of... nothing! Kat the Fearless!\" I joked, zooming around the room like Superman. She stepped in front of, leaning her head in and staring at me seriously. I groaned. \"Okay. I'm afraid of... letting people walk over me.\" She didn't look convinced. \"You?\" I nodded. \"That's why I'm so rough and stuff. Remember in middle school with kids used to make fun of me? Well, not anymore... in that way at least.\" I was sort of lying to her... I guess... after all the time I've spent with Gabe... I was getting to know him and like him... The ego-thing was truly an act. If you stripped him down of all that, you found a guy, scared of being himself and pulling unbelievable stunts to get attention. He was like a sad little puppy. And I guess I felt sorry for him... He wasn't annoying, really. Just... lost, I guess. And maybe I liked him like that. Just. As. Friends. . . . . The next day, I was in the middle of music class, talking to Gabe about our song. We decided to go acoustic on it, and we went over it at his house last night. Even his mom, who I hadn't seen in a long time in-person, said we sounded good. No way was I going to agree with her out loud, so I just nodded and continued to strum the guitar. What? I don't just play drums, you know! So, then we were interrupted by Spazz Moreno on the PA. \"Attention, students. There's been some controversy about the identity of Radio Rebel, and there is nothing more distracting that controversy. Now, I gave her the chance to do the right thing and turn herself in. But she chose to hid, avoiding the consequences of her insubordination. Well, she can't hide forever, which is why until Radio Rebel's identity is revealed... I'm canceling the prom. For everyone .\" She laughed evilly. \"Now do you think there's favoritism at Lincoln Bay?\" The class was outraged. I was one of them. I was one of the few that stood up. \"Crap, but I was nominated for prom queen!\" I shouted, crossing my arms. Gabe looked at me strangely. \"Not like I cared... or anything.\" . . . . After school, everyone liked the idea of going to Slam FM to protest outside. Almost the whole senior class was there, holding up colorfully hateful signs, bashing Rebel. And it was all thanks to Stacey. Oh yay. Tara, Audrey, and I stood outside, trying to blend in with the crowd, holding up protest sings they gave out. This was screwed. Tara couldn't get in, meaning she couldn't do the show without being noticed. And Lord knows that if Stacey DeBane found out that Tara was Radio Rebel, she would lose it, blow up, come back to life, and then murder the poor redhead. And even though I'd know that, we couldn't let it happen... aww. But of course I wouldn't want Tara dead! \"How are we gonna get in there?\" Tara asked in thought. \"I would offer to create a diversion, but I'm afraid this crowd would gnaw my head off in the process.\" I said, shrugging. This was bad. Really, really bad. Yeah, prom was cancelled, but people! There are other proms in Seattle! You could sneak into one and get out before anyone notices you! Just then, a nosey camera crew came onto the scene and walked up to Tara. \"Who do you blame for your prom being cancelled?\" the newswoman asked, holding the mic at her. \"Look,\" Audrey said, \"everybody! It's Radio Rebel!\" Cami Q, disguised in her blue hoodie, trotted away from the building, and the crowd of idiots ran after her, probably going to stomp on her like a herd of elephants. I was about to go help her like the loyal fan I was, but Tara and Audrey latched onto my arms. That gave us a chance to run into Slam. But I never got to know if Cami survived! . . . . \"Hi out there in Radioland. A lot's happened since we last hung out, huh?\" Tara said through the silence in the RR booth. \"Let me know what you guys think. Call me, text me, scrawl on my wall. Don't be shy.\" There were some nice calls, you know from kids not from our school, but among those who did attend Lincoln Bay, they were furious and were determined to bring Tara down with their prom. I covered my ears, not wanting to hear what was going on. Audrey shook me to listen at one point. The call was from Gavin, yet again... but even he was disappointed in Tara–er, Radio Rebel. \"I've always liked you, Radio Rebel,\" he started, \"your playlists truly rock but...\" \"Go ahead. Let it out.\" Tara insisted, closing her eyes. \"It's just... there's a girl I was really hoping to impress that night.\" \"Stacey.\" Audrey whispered to me, rolling her eyes. \"Sorry about that.\" Tara told him. \"Yeah. Me too.\" He hung up. Dirty bastard. \"Wow. Guess you guys are pretty upset. Well, I'll just play some music...\" She let a track play. \"This one's for you guys. Thanks for being honest with me... and I'm really sorry I let 'ya down.\" I got up from my chair just as Rob and Cami came in the big main room. \"They're just angry,\" he told her, \"they'll come around. It doesn't take away from all the good things you've done as Radio Rebel.\" \"Did you hear them? They hate me. I ruined their prom. I feel horrible!\" Tara said. \"You didn't ruin it; that principal did.\" Cami assured her. \"I mean, I knew she was angry, but I didn't think she'd do something like this.\" Tara went on, getting up from her little DJ chair. \"Man, that Moreno's such a backwards-thinker.\" Tara looked like she just found the cure of cancer. \"Backwards... that's brilliant.\" \"Am I missing something?\" I asked, looking around the room. \"Or is everyone as confused as I am?\" \"Same.\" Audrey agreed. Tara walked closer to us. \"Backwards... backwards.\" she said creepily. Okay... now I was scared... . . . . \"Did someone order the Lavidi Sub-tacular?\" That's right. We called the professionals. The Dancing Sandwich. This guy was gonna help us get out of the building, because Stacey was still leading her army of angry prom-goers outside Slam. I was the only one among the three of us who knew the real identity of Sandwich Guy. It was Gavin. Which meant Gavin finally realized that Tara was Radio Rebel. I wouldn't tell her though. I wanted it to be a surprise later on, maybe. We were behind the Slam's reception desk as Gavin held the sandwich that Tara fake-ordered, (Audrey and I real-ordered). \"Hi, could you do us a favor?\" Tara pleaded. \"You want... extra marinara?\" he asked. \"Aud, that would be epic.\" I told her as she nodded. \"Audrey! Kat!\" Tara advised us. \"And focusing... I am the hyena.\" Audrey said, drawing her wide-spread fingers at Gavin, trying to resemble the hyena. \"You see those girls out there?\" Tara asked, gesturing to the crowd. \"We need to get out of here without any of them seeing us.\" \"You can count on me.\" Gavin whispered. I winked at him real slow-like. I couldn't tell if he winked back, but he did go outside and cause a distraction, disrupting the protest and letting us run out Slam without being noticed and piling into Audrey's car. . . . . \"Good morning, Lincoln Bay High School!\" a voice from the PA said the next morning. OMG, Cami! \"This is Cami Q from Slam FM, bringing you a special message from...\" There was a switch in voices. \"Radio Rebel here. Now, you guys really unleashed your fury about the prom drama, and I want you to know that you've been totally heard. Canceling prom was monumentally unfair, but blaming Moreno isn't going to solve anything. I wanna do something about it, and so does Slam. Which is why we're giving you what you want... Your prom back!\" The class cheered victoriously. \"Slam FM is throwing its first-ever Morp. That's prom spelled backwards, because we're turning prom upside down. Tickets are free, and everyone is invited, so don't worry about finding a date, or spending your college savings on a dress or a tux or a limo. Just come as you are, because that's the way we like you!\" I was giddy with glee. Tara's brilliance had restored peace in the school, and I was still in the running for prom–Morp queen. I like the sound of that way better. And... I kind of had just the slightest idea of who I might wanna ask out. Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I don't have any rights towards Radio Rebel. \"Hey, George!\" I called after class to the G. It was the end of the day, and oh boy, I was pooped. \"Wanna go to Morp with me?\" \"Sure.\" he said, shrugging. \"Alright! Pick me up at six?\" He nodded, winking. \"Thanks!\" I went in my locker when to pack to go home when I saw it. Stacey's cold, blue eyes staring at me again from across the hall. I looked back to make sure that there was no one else. Yup. Just me. I slammed my door shut and let her march up to me in her high heels. This should be fun. This should be really fun. I mean, it's Stacey we're talking about. She talks to me more than my own sister does at school... even though most of the talking is made-up of sasses and insults. I wore a closed-lipped smile as she made it in front of me. \"You. Drummer Girl. I thought I told you to bail on prom– Morp queen?\" she asked, folding her arms and shifting to the left. \"Well, just like I told you, maybe I want to be Morp queen. Ha! Didn't expect me to say that, eh? Well, I did.\" I began to walk away, but she pushed me, making me bounce back. I sighed. \"This is me, warning you. You better drop out of the competition,\" she said firmly, \"or else, we're going to have a big problem if possibly, god-forbid you win. Got it?\" She gave a smug smile. My smile, however, transformed into a full-fledged grin. \"Just remember this, then, sweet Stacey. I may be shorter than you... but I still have enough power in my fists to beat your ass .\" Emphasis on the word 'ass.' \"Got it?\" I turned to walk away, but then swung back. \"Ooh, and see you at the party tonight!\" I heard her scowl as I dashed off. . . . . At the party, which surprisingly everyone was invited to, Audrey and I waited on one of the couches in the living room of Stacey's gigantic-ass house/mansion, waiting for Tara to show up. She had a plan I guess, since Radio Rebel was supposed to be on the air at seven, and that the party was through six to eleven or so. I was kind of worried for her. But I was sure she'd figure it out somehow; I had faith in her. She came by, squeezing in between Aud and me, with Stacey intently staring at her from her balcony. Damn thing should've broke and sent her tumbling down for being so up in everyone's business. As soon as seven o' clock struck, the radio said: \"This is Radio Rebel, comin' at 'ya live from Slam Fm,\" Radio Rebel said, \"Tonight is all about you. Lines are open. You know the number.\" I faced Audrey, who was just as confused as I was. Two places at the same time... either Tara figured out how to clone herself or someone was taking over for her over at Slam. \"I'm calling into the show!\" Stacey announced, as if it wasn't obvious enough for her to whip out her cell. Audrey asked, \"How are you here and there?\" Tara shrugged in an I don't know but I do know fashion. \"You're on with Radio Rebel.\" \"Rebel\" said on the radio, surprisingly taking Stacey's call. \"Do you know that you're a hypocrite?\" Stacey demanded. I rolled my eyes, smiling. \"Hi, what's your name, caller?\" \"Save it!\" she snapped. \"You say you're all about the people, but Morp is all about you. Now, you get to lobby for Morp Queen votes on the radio every night. Not fair! The other Morp Queen-nominee should get some air time. Meaning me!\" \"I should get some, too, then!\" I said, just to annoy her. \"I totally hear you.\" Rebel replied. \"You hear me?\" Stacey questioned skeptically. \"I don't think you do. I think you're using subliminal brainwashing to get people to vote for you. So, I'm gonna take this opportunity to ask the school to vote for me: Stacey from Morp Queen.\" \"Hi, what's your name, caller?\" Rebel asked again. I furrowed my eyebrows and looked at Tara, who looked nervous. \"You already asked me that!\" \"Thanks for calling.\" \"I'm done with you! Sorry, but we can't call be all winners, and I'm gonna win, despite the fact that I don't have an entire radio show campaigning for me, which really makes me the underdog.\" I noticed that Tara had suddenly disappeared. I scooted back next to Audrey. Stacey peered down at us to see that. A devious smile danced across her lips when she said, \"Why so quiet? Does the truth hurt?\" \"Come on, Tara.\" I whispered, crossing my fingers. \"You wanna know the truth?\" a non-recorded Radio Rebel voice asked her through the radio. \"Stop hogging the bathroom!\" someone else said. \"What was that?\" beamed Stacey, walking from the balcony. \"I, uh... knocked over my chair,\" Tara supplied, \"because I wanted to get closer to the mic, so that you could hear me clearly.\" \"Oh, I can hear you clearly. I can hear you very clearly. I can hear you so clearly Radio Rebel that we could be in the same building!\" Stacey's voice said from the radio. She had vanished into the house. \"Same building? What are you crazy? Are you here at Slam, Stacey? I don't see you or maybe you're hiding somewhere.\" A few seconds later, she said, \"I'm just a bit worried about you, Stacey, I'm afraid that if I beat you out for Morp Queen your fragile ego won't be able to survive.\" We started laughing in the living room. I held my stomach. So true. So true. \"Can you hand me my jacket?\" someone asked. \"What was that?\" Stacey follow-up asked. \"I'm sorry what?\" Tara replied as an answer. \"Who was that?\" \"That was my sound guy, we just got a brand new demo which they called, 'My Jacket.' We could play it for you.\" \"I have a better idea! Why don't you come forward and stop hiding like a coward?\" \"Would a coward be afraid to go against you for Morp Queen? 'Cause I'm not. I'll see you there and you'll see that I'm not afraid of anything. Thanks for calling.\" Tara ended the call on her. Audrey and I looked at each other and giggled. Epic. . . . . The G's were setting up on stage in the backyard. I was standing by it when Gabe tapped my shoulder. I faced him, finishing my drink and gave him a puzzled look. He rolled his eyes. Why was he talking to me? I was getting the vibe that he didn't want to be seen in public with me, you know, with his new \"rocker\" status and everything. \"I need a favor.\" he requested. \"Why would I want to do anything for you?\" I asked, putting my had on my hip. \"Look,\" He pulled me away from everyone, \"Garrett got sick. He cancelled. I need a drummer.\" \"And I need money.\" I hinted, not so subtly. I stretched out my hand. \"Come on, I know you have a heart of gold somewhere in there.\" He pointed at my chest and I slapped his hand away. \"Do it for the sake of music; not for me.\" I never really noticed that his eyes were like a greenish-hazel. Not brown. They were pretty–er... what the hell? \"Please, Kitty-Kat?\" I scowled and took the drumsticks he offered me. \"I better be getting paid for this.\" \"You've heard us practice, right? You know our song 'We So Fly'?\" \"Yes, and I know that you suck at grammar, telling from the title.\" \"Okay, good. Let's hit it, DiSentis.\" . . . . I can't believe I was doing this. I hate this. But then again... I kinda like getting to finally play for everyone–a live crowd. Gabe winked at me, going up to the mic, and I rolled my eyes, turning my head away. I saw that Tara, Audrey, Larry, and Barry were looking straight at me, laughing and dumbfounded. I smiled and flicked my hand away. I'd probably get endless taunting as soon as I stepped down from here. \"We're the G's, and this is 'We So Fly.'\" Gabe announced. That was the cue for the instruments to start. I clicked my drumsticks together in a \"One, two, three\" kind of way then started playing. Everyone got hype. I didn't dare to look up. I just kept playing and playing, letting the recognition of the song flow through my head. I closed my eyes and drifted off. I imagined what my dad would say if he saw me playing here. He'd probably be happy and ask me 'Who's your friend?' And I'd be like, 'He's not my friend; I don't like him.' He'd be like, 'Yeah, you do, Sweetpea, I can tell you're lying. Talk to him.' I'd be like, 'Dad, are you mental? He doesn't like me!' I-I think I do like Gabe. Like I said before, he's something else under the leather jacket and jackass attitude. He's actually pretty sweet, and funny, and caring, and actually respectable. I looked up and saw him playing his guitar, standing by the mic with Gavin. He actually looked hot... And the words didn't come out with poison and distaste anymore. I heard him wrap up the song, so I quit playing. He grinned at me when the crowd burst with cheers. I sat up from the stool I was sitting on and left the stage. . . . . It was getting pretty late. My mom hadn't called and I was getting dirty looks from Zoe; probably because I played with the G's earlier, and she probably overreacted and said that she was so embarrassed that everyone knew her little sister played with the most popular (only) band in school. I didn't mind; it was pretty fun. I wasn't the Drummer Girl at that moment. I was apart of something. Something wild and exciting. It put me in a good mood. And that mood sort of lifted up a little when Gabe came toward me out of nowhere. He smiled again. \"You went a bit hard,\" he commented, \"but you were good.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Good? Just good?\" \"Yup.\" \"Well you were pitchy.\" I teased, turning to walk home. I had already said bye to my friends and Zoe was spending the night at Stacey's. \"Later, I'm going home.\" He touched my arm to stop me. \"Want me to drive you? I have to take all the equipment home anyway.\" I sighed and nodded, up for it. No way was I staggering home in the streets. I was a little on the drunk side from sneaking a beer or two. \"Fine.\" . . . . The ride home was smooth. Gabe had dropped all the others home and we were coming to a stop on our street. I unbuckled my seatbelt and peeled out of the passenger's seat, opening the door and hopping out. I shut the door and was about to walk straight inside, but then I turned back and felt kind of sorry for Gabe, carrying all the heavy equipment back inside. I breathed and offered up my help. He nodded reluctantly, without a question, and we hoisted everything into his garage, one by one. I was kind of hoping to get paid for this, both carrying equipment and saving his show, but we'd see how this would go. After all of that was done, I let myself into my house and turned on the lights. Mom wasn't home, and reality was finally put back into place. \"You all right?\" Gabe asked, seeing my face. I didn't know if I looked disappointed or what, but I just shook my head, shrugging. I yawned. \"The least I can do is make sure you make it to your room without collapsing.\" I nodded, dazed, and started up the stairs. I almost fell twice, but I successfully made it up the stairs with his assistance. I sprawled myself out on my bed and before he left, I called out, \"Wait. Let's run over the song... just for kicks and giggles.\" He chuckled and came back in the room. I brought out my notepad and I sang the second verse: \" I miss what we had Could it really have been so bad? And I just can't let it go I just feel too damn cold I can't even deny it The feel is so right and My cannot beat anymore~ 'Cause oh, I cannot live anymore Without you, my head's kind of sore My arm have no one to love My lips have no one's to touch 'Cause you, you're just too much to bare I just want you right there By me, so brightly, ever so quietly, so I can see What I'm missing here~ \" The bridge was up next, but I drifted away, hitting the bed again. Gabe was next to me, peering at me. As my eyes closed, I felt his lips on mine. I accepted the kiss, pushing into it further, allowing him to come up on me. His hands held my waist firmly as I toppled on him, grasping a moan from my throat. His lips moved from mine to my neck and I clutched onto the sheets, the cloth feeling soft and comfortable in my fists. I slipped off my top and went back to kissing him, cupping his cheek in my hand. By the time it was one a.m., our clothes were in a small pool by my door, our limbs were tangled, my hair was by his face, our fingers were intertwined, my chest was easing against his, and I just paraphrased what just happened into one thing: We just had sex. And I loved every minute of it. Kisses! TwistedTelepath[Chapter 7] A/N: Hey, guys! News! Uh... DG is going on a three-week break. Semi-full information about it on my profile. Sorry! :( Disclaimer: I don't own Radio Rebel. The early morning peeped through my blinds. My hand was curled on Gabe's chest, admiring it. His arm was wrapped tightly around my waist. And I didn't have to be drunk for everything to sink in. I did enjoy his company. I did like him. I didn't know I liked him this much, but I guess it's what happens after a stressful day at school and a crazy party. I had nothing else to worry about. Mom always came in the afternoon. Zoe was probably doing her hair at Stacey's right about now. There were no worries about being pregnant in my mind. The congregation of rousing feelings buzzed through me, refusing to be settled and tamed. I could daze off to last night. His fingertips felt alien to my skin, but the warmth kept my body's temperature stable. He had my name on his breath. I could remember raking my fingers through his thick head of hair, the soft strands tickled my hand. His body pressed against mine, feeling like it belonged there. His lips... oh, his lips were like feathers against mine - soft, smooth, and comfortable. I never had such a beautiful experience. Everything felt right, and a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have felt like that, but things had changed and I had a new perspective of him. \"Good morning, beautiful,\" he whispered. The hair at the back of my neck rose when the word \"beautiful\" slipped out of his mouth. \"Good morning.\" I replied back, looking up at him. His warm and soft chest pressed against mine, and his hand rested on my lower back. I felt his lips kiss my collarbone, and another explicit moan came from me, my eyes shutting and my head drawing back. \"How was your night?\" I questioned, my voice trembling and high-pitched from how wildly seductive he was being. \"Pretty damn good.\" he said, continuing to kiss my body. He worked his way down to my stomach then came back up to my face, gracing my skin with his lips. \"And yours?\" I giggled lightly, tracing my fingers on his chest. \"Was I good?\" \"You were amazing. \" I breathed, my head dropping back on my pillow. \"I mean, it was my first time, but it couldn't get any better than that.\" He smiled, pleased, and ran his fingers through my hair. I was about to beg him to go another round, but my alarm clock stopped me. If we didn't get a move on, we'd be late for school. \"Let's getted dressed.\" He slid out of the sheets, standing up, giving me a perfect view of his body. I felt my cheeks burn red and I giggled, still feeling like this whole thing was a dream. . . . . At school, I actually made it there on-time. And I was happy; that hadn't happened in a long, long time. I was never happy going to school, but there was something about today that felt so right. I mean, everything was usual, thought. Moreno had her eyes on me, Zoe wouldn't talk to me, and Stacey was out to eliminate me so that she had better chances at becoming Morp queen, but hey, I didn't get into any trouble! I was good today, not the usual pissed-off Kat, but a nice, fuzzy Kat. But then I felt anxiety when I was called to meet up with Mr. Forbes after lunch. I entered his classroom with caution and found him handling a latte while marking papers. He looked up at me, and he was actually happy. I guess happiness was a first today at Lincoln Bay. \"Miss DeSentis, come have a seat.\" he told me, gesturing to the seat in front of his desk. I nervously sat there, crossing my legs. Had someone reported me? Well, wouldn't I know what I did? I hadn't done anything destructive lately. No one had gone home crying because of me this week. I was totally good this week, what could he want? \"I wanted to check up how your alliance with Mr. LaViolet is going.\" A sigh of relief escaped me. I smiled, nodding. \"It's... not bad. We just have to touch up the song, and then we'll be ready to present after Morp. Why? Did he say anything bad?\" \"No, no, I still have to check on him. It's just that you've seemed so... at peace with him lately. I could organize individual grades if you'd like.\" Mr. Forbes said, sipping his latte, smiling. \"It's cool. I guess he's not so bad,\" I admitted, shrugging. The bell rang. I got up. \"I... I gotta go. I promised my friends I'd come to watch their drama performances, and I know some of them would kill me if I wasn't there on-time.\" And by 'some of them,' I meant Audrey. \"See you in class next period, then.\" Mr. Forbes waved me away and I grabbed my bag, running out the room. . . . . I found myself going down the wrong hallway when I ended up backstage instead of facing the stage. But I was here on-time, so Audrey couldn't kill me, maybe chastise me. I got out my phone and started texting Audrey, but my attention switched from my smartphone to up when I noticed Gabe ganging up on Gavin along with George and Garrett. \"Dude, ready to rock out with the drama dorks?\" Gabe chuckled, the other two G guys laughing with him. I rolled my eyes, squinting. \"That's funny,\" Gavin said with a straight face. \"Have you guys seen Tara? She's late.\" But Tara, Gavin, and Stacey were going on next. That didn't make any sense. And it wasn't like sweet little Tara to be late for anything. Weird... \"Move on already! Pay attention to Stacey!\" I tilted my head, quietly moving closer to easedrop. \"You're turning into a real jerk. You know that, don't you?\" \"Me?\" Gavin nodded. \"You're the one who needs to get his priorites straight.\" \"Or what? You're gonna kick me outta the band?\" \"Is that what you want?\" Gabe asked him. He must've been bipolar. This morning he was so happy when he was with me. It meant so much to him. What could change his emotions so quickly? \"What I want is for you to drop this whole rockstar act and just try try to be a normal person,\" \"Okay, I'm the front man of this band. This rockstar act is what put us on map,\" Gabe countered, \"and if you don't wanna be part of that then that's fine with us.\" Goddamn, the other two were just posers, like speak up for yourselves! I'd have to rethink going to Morp with George. \"What happened to G's for life?\" Gavin questioned. \"Yeah, ask yourself that. Enjoy your solo career, Gavin.\" Gabe started to walk off. \"Tell Kat I said hi, would you?\" This made Gabe turn around. I narrowed my eyes in confusion. \"It must be fun using her to do your work. I'm telling her today.\" \"Leave Kat out of this. I can't help it if she likes what she's working with.\" I gasped silently, letting anger come into me. I came out of the shadows and marched up to him. I struck him across the face, feeling so used and dirty. A guy was using me up, making me think he liked me just for a grade. Hell, he had sex with me just for a grade! I screamed, \"You fake fuck!\" \"Kat, it's not what you think!\" \"It's exactly what I think! You're a despicable, disgusting douchebag! Ugh!\" I shoved him away from me, and held myself, regretting everything. I was wasted. I was nothing to him! Just a pawn. This dirty feeling all over me replaced all the euphoria I felt this morning. His hand touched me but I brushed it off and threw a right hook in his face. He staggered back, holding his nose which was bleeding. \"Don't touch me! I don't care if I get points off my grade for working alone, you're not using my song to get credit!\" \"Yeah, because you need it way more than me.\" he chuckled. I was about to go at him again, if it weren't for Gavin holding me back. George and Garrett helped Gabe up. \"And you, you can forget going to Morp!\" I yelled at George. \"I don't deal with followers!\" The three of them left and Gavin put me down. I didn't know what to think of myself any more. It was nasty, and it was my fault for letting my guard down. Once a prick, always a prick. \"Are you okay?\" Gavin asked me. I shook my head, tears unwillingly falling down from my eyes. \"Just... good luck with your project, okay?\" I wiped my eyes and went off. Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 8] A/N: Thank you, guys, for being patient and sticking with me so far (I guess, if this is counted as far). We are sadly coming to an end soon, but hey! For now, let the good times roll. :) Disclaimer: I. Don't. Own. Radio. Rebel. Goodbye. I had to show up to Morp, or else I'd be legitimately turning down my Morp queen nomination. I walked though, since I wasn't going with anyone. I didn't talk to anyone about my feelings. It was just me, my TV, and my notebook for the rest of the Friday. My mom was out and Zoe barely cared anyway, so why would she care if her little sister fucked her ex-boyfriend? Walking all the way to Slam FM wasn't the smartest idea I've had, but I guess it was good to get in-shape or whatever. When I got there, I didn't even care to admire the pretty and vibrantly colored decor. I just searched through the crowd for Audrey or Tara or Larry and Barry. A struck of luck hit me when I found all my friends together with the exclusion of Tara, who was nowhere to be visibly seen. Audrey welcomed me with open arms and I reluctantly accepted that hug. \"Smile, Kitty-Kat,\" Audrey ordered, shaking me. \"By the way, you look really pretty.\" \"What, I don't look pretty everyday?\" I solemnly joked, rolling my eyes. She chuckled lightly, playing with my long hair which was in curls. It wasn't held back or anything, just falling down up to my butt. I had on an orange dress which was strapless and was short in the front and long in the back. The bodice was shimmery and I had on short and white lace gloves. Clear lip gloss was smeared against my lips and my eyelids had mocha eyeshadow brushed on them. I didn't want to go all-out. \"Thanks. You guys look equally as awesome as I do.\" I complimented. \"Where's Tar-\" I stopped when I followed everybody's gaze to the other side of the room, where Tara was making her entrance. She looked simply beautiful. \"Look who decided to come.\" I smiled, giving her a one-armed hug. \"You look amazing!\" Audrey told her. \"Thanks. I need to talk to you two.\" I followed as she dragged us away from the two boys. \"Have you seen Gavin? I really need to talk to him.\" \"What are you gonna say?\" Audrey questioned her. Something told me I was missing out on crucial information. \"I don't know,\" \"You mean you haven't-\" \"Not yet.\" \"You know you need to-\" \"I know!\" \"Am I missing something?\" I asked, shaking my head. \"Yes. We're gonna talk, now.\" Audrey told me and we made our way to a destination unknown to me. . . . . It turned out that the reason Tara was late was because Stacey sabotaged her by locking her in the janitor's closet just to have Gavin all to herself. Audrey went out of her way to make sure Gavin dumped her ass for Morp, and now Tara was freaking out and trying to decide whether or not she should tell him she was Radio Rebel or not. I voted yes, just to save all the drama, but she was still consulting herself. And soon the time came to announce Morp king and queen, so I hid myself away in the crowd, ready to piss myself. Now, I didn't care if I won or anything, I just wanted to get this night over with and done with. As long as I didn't win with Gabe, that's where I was concerned. The last thing I needed was to dance with that fucking creep and act like everything was swell and going good between the two of us when really all hell was about to break loose inside my subconscious. \"Good evening, Seattle!\" Cammi came out on the stage with a mic. Was it me, or were some of the people here dressed like they were going to a prom in the 80's? \"We had two nominations for Morp king, but one dropped out. So that leaves Gabe LaViolet.\" I scowled as everyone clapped as he was crowned. Dammit. \"Now, I'd like to invite or Morp Court princesses to join me on stage. Let's hear it for Stacey Debane,\" She paused for applause, which I didn't really give, \"Katrina DeSentis,\" God dammit, who decided to put me down as 'Katrina'? They were getting a beatdown once everything was said and done. I made my way to the stage and smiled at the crowd, my best fake smile. \"And Radio Rebel!\" I clapped hard and cheered with the rest of the crowd, totally hyped for Tara to come up, but she stayed down with the group. I frowned. Now I'd be on a stage with people I depised... and Cammi. \"Radio Rebel, are you out there?\" Cammi asked, her gaze directed at Tara. She shook her head. I sighed. \"Well, I guess we'll continue. You're Morp queen is...\" Cammi opened an evalope. \"Radio Rebel!\" I cheered happily as everyone in the crowd went wild, but I silenced once I noticed that Tara was gone. If she wasn't on stage, and she wasn't in the crowd, where could she have gone. \"Come on,\" I whispered. \"Most of you don't know me,\" a voice suddenly said from nowhere. \"I'm the girl who sits at the back of the class, who never raises her hand, who's so afraid of saying the wrong thing so says nothing instead.\" I smirked. \"The old me would've frozen in front of a crowd like this, but something happened. Suddenly, the real stuff we were dealing with at school became more important than my fears. Look, I wasn't sure I would be able to do this tonight, but I've got to be true to myself... so here it goes.\" Tara joined us on stage with a mic. \"I'm Radio Rebel.\" Everyone was quiet, but then I started clapping, overjoyed. They pitched in and went wild. I went in to hug her, but I backed off once Moreno came on stage, clapping slowly, menacingly. I growled. \"Thank you for an enlightening evening,\" she said, \"And now that I know who Radio Rebel is,\" She stopped to laugh pointedly at Tara, \"she is definitely getting expelled.\" The crowd's reaction was nothing compared to mine. I was ready to throw the principal off the stage, willing to be sent to juvi for assault and getting expelled myself. But of course I held in all these feelings and stayed at my ground. \"Enjoy your Morp, Tara. And don't bother coming to school Monday.\" I shook my head as the crowd buzzed with chatter. I grabbed the microphone. \"Hey! Hey, everybody do me a favor and shut up!\" I shouted, my voice ringing through the whole room. Once all eyes were on me, I said, \"I'm Radio Rebel, so suck it, Moreno.\" I dropped the mic and turned to get off the stage before she could condemn me for my reference. But my idea was well-received. \"No, I'm Radio Rebel!\" Audrey yelled. \"No, I'm Radio Rebel!\" Gavin spoke up. \"No, I'm Radio Rebel!\" Kim shouted ditzily. I'm pretty sure she didn't even know where she was. \"I'm Radio Rebel!\" Zoe shouted, too, to my own shock. My wide eyes stared at her. Okay... Soon everyone was repeating the three words and then we all called out in unison as one big angry mob. The status quo was thrown out the window. Moreno couldn't screw over all of us. For all she knew, Radio Rebel's identity was still unknown and Tara was pressured into admitting she was Radio Rebel in the first place. Moreno was defeated and in a few seconds Tara was crowned rightful Morp queen, and I was silently demanding for her to make a speech. \"I mean, I guess since we're all Radio Rebel, this crown belongs to all of us, so congratulations, kings and queens.\" she said meekly, holding the crown on top of her red hair. \"But there is one person who's been dreaming of this crown her whole life, although I'm not sure I heard her say she was Radio Rebel.\" she tempted, coming towards Stacey. It seemed the ice queen within melted that night, and I was surprised when she admitted, \"I'm Radio Rebel. I am so Radio Rebel!\" Tara placed the crown on her head and the crowd cheered, even me. And for the first time in a while... I felt Zoe hug me. I guess tonight was a night of miracles. Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath[Chapter 9] A/N: Thank you very much to everyone who participated in reviewing and actually noticing this story in its somewhat dead fan archive, so you guys are well-appreciated! You guys are the ones who kept me motivated! I didn't feel it necessary to make an epilogue. (What, do you guys want me to?) Disclaimer: No rights to RR, though I wouldn't mind a making up a sequel... Nah. On Monday, it came time for our musical presentations, but I remained quietly in my seat. I still felt too hurt from how Gabe used me the other day. Then again, I never gave him the chance to really explain himself... But the situation didn't need explaining. He cheated me, and I went along with it, not sensing alert or suspicion in any way, shape, or form. I didn't want to let go of the fun we had while writing our song, though. And it was kinda good... and I didn't want to waste a perfectly good song that I had slaved over and worked on for weeks... \"Thank you, girls,\" Mr. Forbes said as two random girls went back to their seats. He looked at his clipboard and read off of it, \"Mr. LaViolet and Miss DeSentis?\" I sighed nervously and eyed Gabe evilly from my seat. I got up, though, clutching onto the neck of my guitar, making my way to the front of the class. He soon joined me with his own guitar, since we agreed to each play the two different tones that went along with the theme of our song. He looked at me, compassion actually showing in his eyes. I averted my glance away, strumming my guitar to make sure it worked. \"Are the two of you ready and resolved?\" Mr. Forbes asked us. I tilted my head. \"Yes... and no.\" He raised his eyebrows at me. I shrugged. \"Let's do this!\" For one minute, I actually considered singing the song I made up myself, but I let go of the fact and he started up his verse of our song. As the song progressed, I didn't dare to look at him. Stupid... pretty bastard. I mean, come on, why'd the devil have to look so cute? Ugh... this was as good as sending me straight to hell. I deserved to go straight to hell. Even though there was protection involved, I might be carrying the spawn of a demon. And I might die. Okay, I was overreacting, but there are possibilities, people! I realized I was mumbling to myself through the little break-thingy (which I forgot) so I shut up and stuck to doing all my consulting in my head. So... here's the question. Do I like him still? It's kind of complicated. Do I want to like him? No, obviously. Do I forgive him? Hardly. I promised myself I'd leave sex to college, but if I didn't do a swell job with this damned song, I was looking at another year (possibly pregnant) in high school, which sucked. All I want is to have my dad here, so I could talk to him about this. He would sort of understand, right? I mean, maybe he did wild stuff in high school. Hell, maybe he got somebody pregnant. Maybe he had sex while drunk at a party. Maybe he was in band. Maybe he was shy, but broke out his shell. Maybe he was outspoken. Truth was, I never got to ask Dad these things before he died. But maybe he didn't have the answers to what was in front of me. Maybe, just maybe, I had to quit being arrogant to beat the truth out of this dumb-ass rockstar myself, even if it came to being literal. \" What I'm missing here... \" was the line that ended possibly the longest musical presentation in my life. The class clapped (although I feel they were forced to) and I was quick to go and find my seat... and just as quick in hitting a guy in the head, seated in the front of the class, with my guitar. Everybody laughed. Shit. \"Oh, God, are you okay?\" I asked, the blood rushing to my face. He held his eyes but gave me a thumbs-up. . . . . I figured Zoe and I were all patched up now, so I felt, since we were sisters, that we could tell each other everything now. Rookie mistake. \"You had sex with my ex ?\" she screamed. It would be funny if she wasn't so angry. It rhymed. \"Hey, easy with it, 'kay?\" I shushed her, cupping my hand over her mouth. I pushed her into the janitor's closet, which seemed like a popular place this week. She started fumbling and stuttering and yelling and shaking me frantically, obviously overwhelmed that I was fucked by her ex, but I kept my best straight face and waited until she was done yammering to explain the whole thing to her. Now that she was fully informed, she built up a glare at the broom. \"I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.\" she growled. \" No one humiliates my sister except me !\" I didn't know whether to feel happy or angry over her comment, but before I could actually react, she (being her stubborn self) marched out of the room. I face-palmed myself for actually telling her what happened in the first place and considered telling a therapist, who might have kept it quiet. I heard her screeching his name when she spotted him. She pulled him by the collar and brought him over against his will. I tried not to look smug, seeing that he was just man-handled by a girl who weighed two times less than him. He scowled, rubbing his neck, but froze when he met eyes with me. I rolled mine. \"You have no business fucking my sister,\" Zoe said in a more hushed tone, eyeing Gabe. \"And then, bragging to your friends about it. And using her just for a grade!\" He was about to say something, but she cut him off. \"You know, she needed that grade more than you! She won't graduate next week if she fails, and if she fails, I'm coming to your house personally and serving you an ass-whipping on a silver platter. I knew you were a jerk, a jackass, and a dick wrapped up in one, but this was just low.\" \"Can I talk now?\" he asked, crossing his arms. \"Sure, say whatever you want.\" He sighed, looking at me. \"You never let me explain, since you were so focused on beating the crap out of me. \" I sunk low, a weak smile on my face. I wasn't saying sorry, though. \"Gavin misunderstood what I was saying. I thought your sex was...\" He looked aghast, wearing a lazy smile. \" Amazing. I was going to tell him that if it were possible, I'd drop out of the project, since you deserved the grade more than me for that awesome song, but I sort of made an inappropriate joke and wrecked it all.\" He touched my hand, but, since I was now feeling like jelly, I didn't choose to pull away. \"I really do like you, Kat. At first, I wasn't sure about it, but now I am.\" I didn't know what to say. Maybe he was lying, maybe he was being real. Dammit, I couldn't tell! \"Um... um...\" I stammered, squinting. \"How- how don't I know you're a liar?\" Minus the nosy, gathering crowd, he pulled me close to him, my cheek pressing against his leather jacket. Then, he kissed me. And I let it happen. I just let him kiss me again. I let him put his hands underneath my shirt again, rubbing my stomach. I let him caress me, all fairytale-like, and sweep me off my feet, which is saying a lot for being a short girl. Wow, I was weak. I guess he really did like me, judging from how this kiss was going into fifteen seconds. And it wasn't out of lust or anything, it was sweet and compassionate, which was something I never really expected from someone like him. Truth be told, he really was someone who had a heart of gold. There wasn't insta-love between us, yet, there was always something there, seeing how our hateful relationship escalated into an actual \"relationship\" over time. It would have lasted longer if it wasn't for Moreno. \"You two!\" she yelled. She pried in the middle of his, her hand unintentionally jabbing me in the boob. \"No affection in the hallway! And you ,\" She was staring at me. \"Don't think I forgot about that little comment you made at the prom last Friday.\" I groaned, rolling my eyes. She took my wrist and led me to her office, as if I didn't know where it was already. . . . . Three days later, I found out that I would have been graduating, which almost gave me a heart attack. (No really, I almost dropped out of my chair when I heard.) After re-reading my lyrics, I actually considered the song rubbish. But apparently, according to Mr. Forbes, it was \"well-executed by both students, had a clear message, and expressed a deeper meaning, seeing how both performers were constantly eyeing each other during the display.\" I didn't look at it that way, but I guess I got extra points for feeling something for the jerk. Well, I shouldn't say \"jerk,\" more like \"semi-boyfriend.\" In this whole troubling experience, I guess I actually learned something. Never judge a book by its cover and plot, but by its content, right? I'm not sure that made sense. Did it make sense? Kisses! ~TwistedTelepath ","Summary":" A/N: Yay! New story! Radio Rebel.

But the one thing that caught"},{"Movie":"Radio Rebel","Title":"The Geek and The Rockstar","Author":"NightofSky101","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8115096","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Here's the Radio Rebel story this is kinda like Geek Charming. I do no own anything Radio Rebel or any songs that will be mention. I'm Anna I'm a songwriter, musician, and singer. But for now I go to high school and have amazing friends. I walk to Lincoln Bay High with my guitar case in my hand. I notice Stacey sitting with her pop girls. I waved a friendly hello to her, but she ignored me. I never knew why. I entered the halls and saw Tara and Audrey so I headed toward them. They been my best friends since sixth grade. \"Hey guys\" I said opening my locker witch was next to Tara's. \"Hey Anna\" said Tara \"Did you hear Radio Rebel last night?\" asked Audrey \"I did and it was awesome!\" I said Radio Rebel always inspire me to do my own thing, not matter what anyone says to me. To the pops they considered me a geek probably because of my glasses, but that doesn't stop me from doing music. \"As usual, reject the status quo is my new life motto, she so inspiring so herself,\" said Audrey \"I wish I could be more like her.\" said Tara \"You should talk to your step-dad.\" said Audrey \"What? Why?\" asked Tara \"Uh he runs Slam FM the biggest radio station in Seattle\" I said \"Yeah, maybe he could give you an internship that would be a big coincidence booster.\" said Audrey \"Are you kidding me? He's been married to my mom for like two months, and he probably thinks I'm a total step-freak\" said Tara. \"I freak out whenever he asks what kind of cereal I want\" We closed our lockers and walk down the hallway \"I just wish I could talk to everyone the way I talk to you two. Guess that's why you guys are my BFF's\" said Tara \"BFFTLEWE\" said Audrey. Tara and I gave her a confused look. \"Best friends for totally like ever without exception.\" she said. \"Catchy\" Tara and I said. \"You should try my relaxation technique, when I'm memorizing lines for drama I imagine that I'm breathing in the words.\" said Audrey \"Audrey what does that even mean?\" asked Tara. Audrey then cleared her throat and took a deep breath. \"You need to breath… your words\" she said. I so do not get drama. \"How could you even breath at a time like this\" said Barry pushing us from behind. \"Problem Barry?\" asked Audrey and we all started to walk again. \"Last night Radio Rebel reveled the biggest clue of her identity, she goes to our school.\" he said \"She mentioned at 14:30 on Tuesday's podcast.\" said Larry Then we walked into the elevator \"Wow obsessed much Larry?\" I asked \"Obsessed? Please I would hardly describe myself as obsessive\" he said and he pulled out a wet wipe from his shirt and cleaned the elevator button and pushed it. \"What? It's flue season\" wow I was right. The doors opened and we all came out. \"This is so cool someone on radio who's actually one of us\" said Larry \"Oh it could be that girl… no her… or her\" said Barry point at random girls \"No that girl is too tall Radio Rebel voice sounds about 5'6 and her hair is reddish, like Tara's.\" \"No way she is nothing like Tara\" \"Hey, What's that supposed to mean?\" asked Tara \"Oh we love you but your nothing like Radio Rebel who is a blonde.\" said Barry \"And you know this how?\" asked Larry \"Radio Rebel is my soulmate, I too got a minus in participation.\" \"How can that be you never shut up.\" During their argument Tara and I saw Stacey kicking a boy's remote control car, he accidentally drove in front of her. \"How are supped to reject the status quo when the status quo is… status quo\" said Tara \"Like Radio Rebel said, be ourselves\" said Audrey and she headed over to Stacey and we all followed her. \"Hi Stacey how's it going?\" asked Audrey \"This is what I was talking about, everyone thinks they can talk to us because of that eternally lame radio babble.\" said Stacey \"We thinks she protest too much.\" said Barry, he and Larry were standing next to Kim. \"Yeah we thinks… wait what do we thinks?\" asked Larry sounding confused \"That she might be Radio Rebel.\" \"Please like I would ever encourage people like you to talk to us.\" she said \"Ah ha, so you admit you listen to her\" \"This one's staring at me, make it stop.\" said Kim \"Please don't stand so close to us\" \"You and I aren't any different, like Radio Rebel said-\" said Audrey but was cut off by Stacey. \"No words, you don't think were different. Watch and learn, principal Marino\" she said and principal Marino was heading towards us. \"Is everything alright over here?\" she asked \"Actually no, Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some podcast in class, and I of course said no\" she lied \"What? No I-\" asked Audrey in disbelief \"You know that there's anti-distraction policy, let me see your bag\" said principal Marino and Audrey handed her her bag. \"But I wasn't even listening to it\" \"Well now you can't can you\" said principal Marion in a mocking voice. \"You too young lady hand it over.\" and Tara handed her music player. \"Oh and so was Anna.\" Stacey lied again and I handed principal Marino my music player as well. \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention Stacey.\" said principal Marino and she left. \"Get it now? Your little DJ hero doesn't know what she's talking about.\" said Stacey \"Oh, does her royal shyness want to say something.\" Tara wanted to say something, but she couldn't say it. I sometimes wish for her to come out of her shell. I know there's something in her. \"I thought not\" said Stacey \"See ya around\" I said to her, she gave me a look and left with the rest of the pops. \"I got to go\" I said and left Tara and Audrey. I was heading to my music class while on the way I pulled out my song book and pencil. Trying to write this new song. Then I bumped into someone and my music sheets scatter all over the floor. Then I saw it was Gabe. Uh, I hate that guy! \"What the heck?\" I yelled and I picked up my music sheets. \"Watch were your going!\" said Gabe \"Why don't you stop being a jerk!\" and I left heading in the classroom. Gabe and I have been arguing since middle school I never like him or his band the GGGG's. I knew Tara like Gavin who was also in the band, but I didn't mind I thought Gavin was cool. As for Gabe I always thought of him as a jerk, and I don't think he actually knows any real music. All he cares about is being popular. Class started I love my music class, but I hate that Gabe was in the same class with me. \"Alright class we will be working on a duet assignment. I'm going to pair all of you up with someone and you two will write a song and perform together.\" said the teacher A duet sound cool, I wonder who I be paired up with. The teacher started to pair everyone then called my name. \"Anna and Gabe\" I was shocked \"What?\" we said in disbelief. \"I can't work with Gabe.\" I said \"And I can't work with Anna.\" said Gabe \"You two will work together or you can get an F on this assignment.\" said the teacher We didn't have a choice we had to work together. Oh great this going to be awful. After the teacher paired everyone we all went to talk to out partners. So I went up to Gabe, I can't believe I'm doing this. \"Look I'm not happy with this, but we need to work together as songwriters\" I said \"Fine how about you write the song and we can perform it together.\" he said \"Or we write the song together.\" I said sarcastically \"Okay then what do we do?\" \"Come over to my place tomorrow and we can come up with the song.\" \"Fine as long as no one in school see us together.\" he said \"Only in class and at my place alright\" \"Sounds good to me\" \"The sooner we finish the song the sooner we'er away form each other\" I said \"Good\" he said and I walked away form him. I went back to my desk and back to my song book. I hope nothing goes wrong. There's my first chapter and I hope you readers will like it. Plus check out MBAV A Different Story. More chapters soon. xoxo[Chapter 2] After school I went home. I didn't tell Tara and Audrey about my problem with Gabe. But they did tell me what happened in their drama class. Poor Tara she got up in front of the class and Gavin was there. I was in my room doing my homework and listening to Radio Rebel. \"But who are you exactly. I think everyone is always juggling a bunch of different yous. Like when your with your friends,\" \"Sometimes your the funny one or the loud one, thoughtful one. How about with someone you like. Which you show up then? I don't even know who to be with the guy I'm crushing on,\" \"Which is probably why I never talk to him. Is it just me or do you feel like your like seventeen different people too?\" Hmm I wonder, I sometimes feel like that. I don't even know who to be tomorrow when Gabe comes over. I went down stairs to the kitchen to ask my mom for help. She's always there for me ever since my dad left us. \"Hey mom\" I said \"Hey sweetie\" she said \"Mom can I ask you something\" \"What is it?\" \"You know that guy Gabe\" I said \"Rockstar Gabe from school that you hate\" she said. \"Yeah, he and I were assigned to be partners for my music class and I don't know if I can handle it,\" I said \"Honey why do you even hate him?\" she asked \"Mom, he's a jerk, he only cares about being popular, and he never is a real person.\" \"Well honey, all I could tell you is. You two should put your differences aside\" \"How am I going to do that\" I asked \"Just focus on your assignment, or find something you two have in common\" she said \"What? He and I don't have anything in common.\" I said. How could that be possible? \"How do you know if you two don't have anything in common if you never get to know each other\" \"I could just tell\" I said \"Who knows Anna you mite be surprised.\" she said That would be strange for me and Gabe to get along. I headed back to my room wondering if he and I may have something in common. No, we couldn't. The Next Day at School. I was in class and the teacher was telling us about our assignment. Then class ended. I head toward Gabe to tell him about tonight. \"Gabe\" I said \"What\" he said \"Remember to over to my place tonight\" \"Fine I'll be there after I practice with my band\" \"Fine and don't be a jerk\" he rolled his eyes and I walked away. Uh tonight going to be awful. Gym Class. I was in gym with Tara and Audrey witch was good. Audrey told me how Tara, Gavin and Stacey would be work together in their drama class. And Tara told us that Gavin was taking Stacey to prom. \"Of course he's taking Stacey to prom.\" said Tara \"Hey at least you talked to him.\" I said \"Yeah for you that't major progress.\" said Audrey \"I barely got two words out.\" said Tara I knew I had to tell them about my problem with Gabe. \"Uh guys I need to tell you something.\" I said \"What is it Anna?\" asked Audrey \"Well in my music class yesterday, Gabe and I were assigned to do a duet.\" \"What?\" said Tara and Audrey in disbelief. \"I thought you hated Gabe.\" said Tara \"I do\" I said. \"Wow good luck with that Anna. Hey, why don't you two come over my house tonight? I'll teach you my hyena pose and we'll listen to Radio Rebel.\" said Audrey Oh great I forgot Radio Rebel was going to have her first show on Slam FM. At least I can look forward for that. \"I can't\" said Tara \"Me either\" \"What do you mean? It's Radio Rebels first show on Slam FM do you realize how epic that is? I mean she was popular before but now it's like the whole world will be listening\" \"Gabe and I need to start on our assignment tonight\" I said \"Okay, but what about you Tara?\" asked Audrey \"I have plans.\" \"What kind of plans\" I said \"Family plans.\" \"You are such a bad liar you look just like you did when you said you like that new haircut I got at the mall\" said Audrey \"It wasn't that bad\" said Tara \"It was terrible. Tell us what your doing or I'll jus start screaming in three seconds.\" Audrey then stopped and turned to Tara \"What\" said Tara \"1… 2…\" Then Audrey screamed so loud Tara covered her mouth. She sure knows how to scream. \"Well\" I said turning to Tara. \"I'm sorry, I can't tell you\" she said. \"I thought we were you BFFTLE\" said Audrey \"Without exception\" said Tara \"Then why don't you trust us?\" asked Audrey. Then Tara left us, I wonder whats going on with her? At Lunch. We were all at lunch with Larry and Barry. Audrey wasn't talking to Tara and I was just felt a little awkward with them not talking. I saw the GGGG's coming outside. Great Gabe out here. \"Oh no, Gavin at 3:00\" said Tara \"Your 3:00 or my 3:00\" asked Barry \"Her 3:00\" I said to him Then Gavin was coming over. \"Oh no he'e coming over here what do I do\" asked Tara who was panicking \"For the record this is why you don't ice you friends out,\" said Audrey \"Talk to him\" we both said \"Hey Tara what's up,\" said Gavin who was leaning against our table. \"So uh do you wanna run lines this weekend?\" he asked Tara didn't say anything but was miming. \"Or we could mime the lines if your not feeling particularly talky\" said Gavin \"Mime, talky… uh me… going…now\" said Tara. She got out of her seat and started to speed walk away from Gavin. \"Um okay\" said Gavin and he went back to his table. I saw Gabe and he saw me. He glare at me and I glared back. I got up with Audrey and started to go after Tara. \"Tara\" we said \"You okay\" I asked as we caught up to her. \"Yeah I guess\" she said. \"Don't worry maybe he didn't notice\" said Audrey. Then we went back to our table. I wonder if she would be listening to Radio Rebel tonight. Tara sound a little suspicious I wonder why? After School I went home getting ready to hear Radio Rebel on Slam FM. Then Gabe was going to come over. Oh great. \"Mom, I'm home\" I said entering the house. I went into the kitchen and found a note on the table. 'Anna had to work late won't be home til 8 made your favorite sandwich its in the microwave love Mom' I took out the sandwich and ate for a little while. Then I went up to my room, started to play my guitar and started to sing. Break it down let it all out I'll give you my opinion Walking around running my mouth Cause I'm not about pretending I talk tough calling your bluff Don't tell me what I can't do Don't ask me to ignore what in my heart I know is True (Yeah) I never want to be predictable I'm never gonna take the easy road I never wanna' follow where the Ordinary ones have gone before And that's why everyday I say it to myself Be fearless and nothing is impossible So fearless and know that you're invincible Be fearless prove the undeniable Cause your so much stronger than you know So let it go I looked at my watch and saw that Radio Rebel was about to come on. I turned my radio to Slam FM as fast as I could. Luckily I was on time, this is going to be awesome. Thanks for reading promise to be more involve with this story during summer. PS songs info will come up after chapters. Song - Artist - Album Fearless - Daechelle - Bratz (Motion Picture Soundtrack) BTW I do not own song lyrics. xoxo[Chapter 3] \"Your listening to Slam FM and this is The Radio Rebel show\" said the man on the radio. \"This is Radio Rebel live from Slam FM, listen I gotta confess, moving my show from my bedroom to Slam FM was a bit terrifying, but hey life's all about change right?\" \"Maybe some people just wanna label you as one thing, analyze you then walk away, we don't have to let that stop us from becoming who we wanna be, like that kid with the remote control car maybe he's gonna grow up to invent the first ever green rocket ship, or that girl who gives everyone carnations on Valentine's day just so no one feels left out, maybe she could to be president...\" \"Guys if we just drop the labels and clicks and just be ourself, we have no idea what were capable of. Okay if your with me on this, wear red tomorrow, it'll be like saying despite our differences, were in this together. This song is from Red Letter Day.\" I still could't believe that Radio Rebel was on Slam FM. I wonder where Gabe is, I'm not waiting for him. Then I heard a knock on the door. I open the door and it was Gabe. \" Hey\" he said not exited. \"What took you so long.\" I said. \"Its only 7.\" he said as he entered my house. \"Fine, just go in living room I'll be right back.\" I said. I went to my room to get my guitar, and lucky pen. No way is he seeing my song book. I went to the living room and turned the radio on to Radio Rebel. \"You listen to Radio Rebel.\" he said. \"Yeah don't you.\" I said. \"Yeah, so does my buddy Gavin.\" he said. I didn't know Gabe listen to Radio Rebel. \"Well thats cool. I'll be right back I forgot something\" I said. I forgot to get some song sheets, so I went to my room again. I went through my desk and found some, then I turned around and saw Gabe looking at my song book! \"What are you doing!\" I shouted. \"I was just looking.\" he said holding my song book. \"Give that back!\" I demanded. \"Fine!\" he said and tossed my book, luckily I was able to catch it. \"Don't you ever look through my song book!\" I said. \"You know what, I was going to say something nice, but forget it.\" he said and left my room. Maybe Mom was right, we should put our differences aside and get along. I went down stairs with the song sheets and, my song book. I figure, whatever he read it could help us with the song. \"Gabe, I'm sorry I got mad. I'm not use to anyone looking at my song book.\" I apologized. \"Its alright,\" he said. \"Look let's just start over and try to work as partners.\" I said. \"I'd like that.\" he said. \"So what did you read from my song book?\" I asked. As I sat on the couch next to him. \"I was reading this\" he said. He took my song book and turned to the page he was reading. Now here we are, so close Yet so far, haven't I passed the test? When will you realize \" Oh uh, thats not done yet.\" I said. \"Is this what you were writing yesterday?\" he asked. \"Yeah, but its not finish, I don't know. I think I have writer's block.\" I said. \"Oh, well that a bummer.\" he said. Half an hour later we had nothing plan, or anything done and he had to go. \"I gotta go I can't miss my family dinner.\" he said. \"Okay, do you want to pick this up tomorrow.\" I asked. \"Yeah, but come over to my place.\" he said \"Fine I'll see you tomorrow.\" I said. And he left. That was an terrible night. We kept arguing and we could come up with anything. Hope its not like that tomorrow. Next Day Everyone in school was wearing red. I had my red shirt and I headed toward Tara who was also wearing red. So she did listen to Radio Rebel. \"Hey Tara.\" I said. \"Hey Anna.\" she said. \"I see your wearing red\" I said. \"Yeah, I am.\" she said. \"So you did listen to Radio Rebel.\" I said. Then Audrey came wearing some red glasses. \"Ahem. Do you like my red rims?\" asked Audrey. \"But you have freakishly good vision.\" said Tara. \"Fashion shouldn't be functional.\" said Audrey. And we notice they didn't have lenses. Nice idea. \"Do you know why I chose red rims? I assume you do because of your red clothes\" she said as looked at Tara. \"I can't believe all these people are wearing red just because Radio Rebel said to, how cool is that.\" said Tara. \"So you did listen to Radio Rebel last night. What happened to your mystery plans?\" asked Audrey. Then elevator opened revealing Barry and Larry wearing red identical outfits. \"Can you guys tell us apart?\" they asked. \"You guys are fraternal not identical.\" I said and we all went in with them. Then the elevator open and we all walked out. \"We just ran a recording of Radio Rebel through a voice analysis app, we're closer than ever to revealing her true identity.\" said Barry. \"Think about it, local twins crack Radio Rebel ID. We could be famous, we could get a reward, or at least our own reality show.\" said Larry. \"Where she and I could be married live on T.V. Tara, since you step-dad runs Slam FM maybe you could help us out.\" he asked \"Oh, I'm not allowed to go to Slam anymore while she's there, to keep the mystery mysterious.\" said Tara. \"The truth is Tara doesn't have time for any friend related things.\" said Audrey and she walked away from us. Then Tara and I followed her. \"Audrey, Audrey, AUDREY!\" said Tara trying to get her attention. \"What?\" said Audrey as she turned around. Tara was about to say something, but couldn't. \"Forget it I'm leaving.\" said Audrey. Then Tara pulled me and Audrey to face her. Then she closed a classroom's door. What is she doing? \"I'm about to tell you two something so top secret, but you two have to promise you cannot say it anyone.\" said Tara. \"Okay I promise I won't say it to anyone.\" said Audrey. \"I promise I won't either, you could say it.\" I said. Tara mumbled it. What is trying to say? \"Tara you need to breath you words.\" said Audrey. Then Tara mumbled it again. \"Louder common, breath the words.\" said Audrey. \"You can do it Tara.\" I said. \"I'm Radio Rebel.\" said Tara. Wait, What? \"Oh… I don't believe you.\" said Audrey. \"Neither do I.\" I said. After School Tara took me and Audrey back to her house to prove she is Radio Rebel. She was talking through a mic and we were listening through a headset. \"If your like me and believe music can change the world one track at a time, your gonna love this one from one of my new favorite bands\" said Tara. Audrey and I were in shock to know that Radio Rebel is Tara. She's so shy in school, but is so out spoken as Radio Rebel. \"Wow\" We said. \"I can't believe its you, I mean your her, I mean your the last person I expect to be Radio Rebel Tara.\" said Audrey. \"Me too, I just can't believe this.\" I said. \"It's been driving me crazy not telling you both, and of course I want to hang out, but I've been doing my show.\" \"Here's the thing though, you two can't tell anyone not even Larry and Barry, because Slam wants to keep this big secret and, so do I\" said Tara. Audrey and I started to squeal and we pulled Tara for a group hug. This is so cool my best friend Tara is Radio Rebel! At Gabe's house After finding out about Tara's secret, I went over to Gabe's house. Hope this won't be awkward like last night. I rang the door bell. Then I saw him. \"Hey.\" I said. \"Hey. You ready to write?\" he asked. \"Yeah let's do this.\" I said. We headed to his garage where I notice some instruments and a little recording station. \"This is where my band The GGGG's practice and record.\" he said as he grabbed some stools for us to sit. \"Oh thats, cool.\" I said. \"So you have anything else from you song book?\" he said \"Uh yeah, I do.\" I said then a grabbed my guitar and started to sing. I like the way you sound in the morning We're on the phone and without a warning I realize your love is the best sound I have ever heard I like the way I can't keep my focus I watch you talk, you didn't notice I hear the words, but all I can think is We should be together Every time you smile, I smile And every time you shine, I'll shine for you Whoa, I'm feeling you baby Don't be afraid to Jump then fall Jump then fall into me Baby, I'm never gonna leave you Say that you wanna be with me too 'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all So jump then fall The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet I'll catch you, I'll catch you When people say things that bring you to your knees I'll catch you The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry But I'll hold you though the night until you smile Whoa oh, I need you baby Don't be afraid please Jump then fall Jump then fall into me Baby, I'm never gonna leave you Say that you wanna be with me, too 'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all So jump then fall Jump then fall, baby Jump then fall into me, into me, into me \"So what do you think?\" I asked. \"Its good, but its a love song.\" he said. \"So, what about it.\" I said. \"Well, its too sappy.\" he said. Wait, what did he say? \"What?\" I said no has ever said that to one of my songs. And I started to get angry. \"Wait what do you mean its sappy!\" I said. \"Look its a good song, it just seems to obvious of you to write a love song like this.\" he said. \"And you think you know my taste in music!\" I said. \"I just think writing a love song is not a good idea to write!\" he said. \"You know what I'm out of here. I tried to be nice with you, but your not giving me a chance!\" I said and I stormed of the garage. I just could handle it anymore. I rather get an F instead of working with Gabe. Sorry it took so long I had writer's block and I had to watch Radio Rebel to remember the movie. But don't worry I'm still sticking to this story. Songs in this story: Give Your Heart A Break - Demi Lovato - Unbroken Jump Then Fall - Taylor Swift - Fearless Platinum Edition Hope you like it and thanks for reading. More chapters soon. xoxo[Chapter 4] I was already home and I finished my homework. After what Gabe said, I just could't face him even more now. Then I herd a knock at the door, so I went to open. It was Gabe. What does he want? \"What are you doing here?\" I said. \"Look Anna, I'm sorry I criticizes your song,\" he apologize. \"You serious right now\" I said. I never thought Gabe would apologize to anyone. \"Yeah, look let's just start over again and finish the song.\" he said \"Okay, but no more acting like a jerk, I mean it Gabe.\" I said. We headed to my room and began to write. \"So what kind of song should we write.\" I said. \"I don't know. What do you think?\" he said. \"I want to write a love song. Those are my best.\" I said. \"I don't know\" he said. I knew there was something wrong with him. \"Gabe. Why don't you want to write a love song?\" I asked. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" he said. \"Gabe you could tell me anything. I promise whatever it is I won't say it to anyone.\" I said. After all I already knew Tara is Radio Rebel. \"Okay, you know that song you were sing in my garage,\" he said. I nodded my head. \"Well, it reminded me of my ex\" he said. His ex? \"I hadn't talk to her seen she moved, I felt pretty lost with out her.\" he said. \"Gabe I'm sorry about that.\" I apologize. I never thought Gabe would be honest to me. \"I wanted our relationship to keep going on, but she didn't, so we broke up.\" he said. \"I'm sorry I didn't know. But you know what, it's her lost for breaking up with you\" I said. Gabe seems different in a way. I wonder. \"Thanks Anna.\" he said. \"So you still want to write a love song.\" I said. \"Sure, why not.\" he said. \"I promise I won't make it sound like your ex, alright.\" I said \"Alright I trust you.\" he said. Then we started to write the song. We came up with good lyrics, but while we were writing, Gabe kept looking at me. \"Anna, can I ask you something?\" he asked. \"What is it?\" I said. \"Can you take off your glasses.\" he said. What? No one has ever asked me that. Nor have I ever token off my glasses in front of anyone. \"I don't know.\" I said. Then he came up to me. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. Then he took off my glasses. I kept looking at him and his eyes. \"Sorry, about that.\" he said and backed away. \"Its okay\" I said a little nervous. \"Why don't you take off your glasses? Don't you have contacts. \" he asked. \"I do, but I just like wearing them.\" I said. \"Well you look good with and without your glasses.\" he said. That was pretty sweet of him. \"Thanks\" I said and started to giggle. So was Gabe, I never saw him smile before. \"So, shall we get back.\" he said. \"Yeah\" I said putting my glasses back on. I don't know why, but I feel a little different with Gabe. Then he saw something behind me. \"What are you looking at?\" I asked \"That picture.\" he said pointing at the picture of me and Stacey. \"Oh, thats me and… Stacey\" I said. I never told anyone about me and Stacey. Even Tara and Audrey don't know. \"You and Stacey, the most popular girl in school.\" he said in disbelief. \"She and I were friends back in elementary school, and then she stopped being my friend by sixth grade. I never knew why, we were pretty close. I sometimes do miss her though.\" I said. \"Well I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" he said. \"It's okay. Stacey doesn't even want me to tell anyone.\" I said. \"Don't worry, I can keep a secret.\" he said. \"Thanks Gabe.\" I said. After we came up with the first part of the song, which it was going well. I didn't want Gabe to leave. Weird right. \"Hey, do you think I can hang out with you for a little while?\" he asked. What? \"Don't you need to practice with the GGGG's.\" I said. \"Oh no, I told the band that practice was cancelled today.\" he said. \"Well… okay. Why do you want to hang out with me?\" I asked. \"I don't know. I guess I just want to get to know you.\" he said. \"Well other than I am Stacey's ex friend. I live with my Mom, I been interested in music since I was five, and I want to be a sing.\" I said \"Really but, where's you Dad?\" he asked \"He left me and my Mom. I was just three, so I don't know that much about him.\" I said. \"I'm sorry about that.\" he said \"Its okay, but what about you?\" I asked \"I live with my Mom and little sister ever since my Dad died. I was ten and my sister was just born.\" he said. \"Oh, Gabe I'm sorry.\" I said. \"It's okay, he did inspire me to do music, since he was in a band as well.\" he said \"Is that why you started the band the GGGG's.\" I said. \"Yeah and I promise him that we will be famous for him.\" he said I guess the GGGG's weren't so bad after all. I did hear a couple of songs from them ever since they got popular. \"I gotta go. Its getting late.\" he said. We went down stairs and to the door. Then Mom came in. \"Hi Mom.\" I said. \"Hi sweetie. Who's this?\" she asked looking at Gabe. \"Oh Mom. This is Gabe my music partner.\" I said. \"Wells its nice to meet you Gabe.\" she said. \"You too Mis Rosen.\" he said. Then I lead him to the door. \"By the way Anna come over to my place tomorrow.\" he said. \"Okay, but don't criticizing my music.\" I said. \"Fine see yeah tomorrow.\" he said and left. Then I went in the kitchen with Mom. \"Anna I thought you said you hate Gabe.\" she said. \"I did… until… \" I trailed off. \"You found something in common with him.\" she said. \"Okay I did.\" I said. \"Well thats good isn't it Anna, you finally got to know him.\" she said. \"Yeah, but I feel a little weird with him.\" I said. \"Sounds like you like him.\" she said. \"Mom I don't like him. He's just a friend.\" I said. There's no way I could like him. Next Day It lunch and I was sitting with Tara and Audrey. I don't know if I should tell them about my night with Gabe. \"So Tara, how it going with Stacey and Gavin?\" I asked. \"Well I finally said something to them\" said Tara. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Well, while we were rehearsing for the scene we're doing, I stood up to Stacey.\" she said. Wow Tara stood up to Stacey. \"Well thats awesome Tara. I knew you had it in you.\" I said. \"By the way Anna, how was your night with Gabe?\" asked Audrey. \"Was it bad that working with him.\" said Tara \"No actually it was good. We got the first verse of the song and I got to know him.\" I said. \"Oh you guys. You won't believe what I got.\" said Tara reaching for her backpack. \"What is it?\" asked Audrey. \"I got the GGGG's demo.\" said Tara. What the GGGG's demo? \"How did you get that?\" I asked. \"Gavin forgot about it after we done rehearsing, and I thought maybe I could play it during the show.\" said Tara. This should be good. Gabe's House I went over to Gabe's after school. I don't know why, but I was really exited to see him again. I rang the door bell and there was Gabe. \"Hey Gabe.\" I said. \"Hey Anna, come in.\" he said. Then I saw a little girl about eight years old coming down stairs. \"Gabe who is this?\" she said. \"Lilly this is my friend Anna, Anna this is my little sister Lilly.\" he said. \"Nice to meet you Lilly.\" I said. \"You too and I thought she was your girlfriend.\" she said. \"Oh uh, Lilly, Anna and I will be in the garage doing homework alright.\" he said. \"Alright, but can you turn on the radio to Radio Rebel?\" she asked. Wow Tara has gone famous. \"Sure, Anna you can go in the garage if you want\" he said. \"Alright I'll meet you there.\" I said. How sweet of Gabe. I went to the garage and turned on the radio to Slam FM. I hope Tara does play the GGGG's demo. Then Gabe came in. \"I hope you don't mind but, I wanted to listen to Radio Rebel.\" I said. \"Its okay as long as we don't get distracted.\" he said. We started to write the song and then Radio Rebel aka Tara came on. \"You people at Lincoln Bay HIgh killed it with the red yesterday. I noticed one of you wearing these red specs yesterday that were the epitemy of cool.\" \"But can we talk about what's not cool for a second? How the school keeps confiscating our stuff, I mean I've lost two sets of headphones and an MP3 player just this term alone. Although I did notice that some of us seem to be exact with this stuff snatching academic. Fun how that works huh.\" \"But guys it's not just our playlists and players were being deprived of I mean. Music is the soundtrack of our lives, its where we've been and where were going and everywhere in between. Our music is who we are. Are we gonna let someone just snatch that away from us? Or are we gonna change the game. Here's a new song about trying things you never thought you could.\" \"Look I've been trying a bunch of new things lately and this song severely inspires me. So check it out vibe it really really dig on it and then remember that feeling, tomorrow at 8AM stop what you're doing, get up and dance just express yourself let yourself out. This is 'Turn It All Around' by the GGGG's.\" Oh My God the GGGG's were on Radio Rebel. \"Did she just say the GGGG's?\" said Gabe. \"Yeah. You guys are on Radio Rebel!\" I said. Gabe and I started to dance. Then right after the song was done he pulled me in for a hug. We pulled away and sat down. It was quiet for a while. What just happened? And I think I liked it. Weird. Sorry for not updating the internet was down. But I'm back now. Thanks for reading more chapters soon. xoxo[Chapter 5] Hey guys I'm back and my computer is working again. I deleted the 'bad news' chapter and here is the new chapter. The next day it was 8AM everyone in class was dancing to the music just because of what Tara said yesterday. I was kinda dancing in my seat until Gabe came up to me. \"Common Anna you heard what Radio Rebel said last night.\" he said. I don't usually dance but why not. \"Alright I'll dance.\" I said and I did. It was fun and I was dancing with Gabe. I never wanted it to stop. Then all of a sudden the music stopped and so did the dancing. \"This is a place of learning not dancing and anyone listening to Radio Rebel during school will be suspended, and Radio Rebel I advise you to turn yourself in now or your future will be radio silence.\" said principal Marano. \"Well that was fun while it lasted.\" whispered Gabe as he got back to his seat. \"I wished it didn't stop.\" I whispered back. I wonder how Tara did in class today. Lunch Time Tara, Audrey, and I were about to head to the benches until we saw Gavin. \"Hey Tara. Can I talk to you for a second?\" he asked. Tara was nervous to answer, so Audrey and I pushed her to go. Audrey and I went to the bench trying to figure out, why Gavin wanted to talk to her. \"You think its because of the song last night.\" I said. \"Maybe, sounds like it.\" said Audrey. \"Anna.\" I heard someone say. I turned around and it was Gabe. \"Can I talk to you?\" he asked. I looked at Audrey she nodded her head. \"Uh, sure why not.\" I said. I got up from my seat and started to walk with Gabe. \"What's up?\" I said. \"i just wanted to say I had fun in music class today.\" he said. \"Me too, until principal Marano stop the music.\" I said. \"Yeah, and I was wonder, why are you wearing you glasses?\" he asked. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Remember the other day I took off your glasses.\" he said. I shrugged at the memory. \"Yeah I remember what about it.\" I said. \"I just think you should just wear your contacts.\" he said. \"I don't know. Do you think I should.\" I said. \"Anna, I really think you should. It could be a good thing to trying something new. Like Radio Rebel said life's about change.\" he said. He could be right. I don't need to wear my glasses all the time. \"Fine I'll wear my contacts.\" I said. I went through my bag for my contacts and mirror. Gabe was holing the mirror as I was putting on my contacts. After I put my contacts on, I put my glasses in my little case and then in my bag. \"So what do you think?\" I asked. \"I think, you look great.\" he said. \"Thanks. I'll see you later.\" I said. \"Yeah, see yeah later Anna.\" he said and left. I went back to Audrey and Tara was back. They looked surprise. \"Anna, where are you glasses?\" asked Audrey. \"They're in my bag.\" I answered. \"But I thought you could't see without your glasses.\" said Tara \"I can't, but I'm wearing my contacts. Gabe thought it would be cool for me to just take off my glasses.\" I said. \"Sounds like you might like him.\" said Audrey. \"Audrey I don't like Gabe he just… a friend thats all.\" I said. \"Whatever you say.\" she said. I do not like Gabe. \"Oh by the way Tara. Why did Gavin wanted to talk to you?\" I asked. \"He asked how Radio Rebel got the GGGG's demo, so cover it up. By saying that I gave the CD to Rob and he gave it to Radio Rebel.\" she said. \"At least your secret is safe. By the way did you guys dance this morning?\" I asked. \"Yeah we did. Gavin was about to dance with Tara, until Stacey blocked them.\" said Audrey. Great, what does Stacey have against Tara. \"Tara I'm sorry about that.\" I said. \"It's okay the main thing is I took my own advice.\" she said. After School I went home and finished my homework. I could wait to see Gabe again. \"Hey Anna.\" I heard and I saw my mom standing near my door. \"Hey Mom.\" I said. \"Anna why aren't you wearing you glasses?\" she asked. Was it really a problem. \"Oh I took them off and decided to wear my contacts.\" I said. \"Since when do you wear contacts?\" she asked. \"Since I-I…\" I said. I didn't know if I should tell her. Then I sighed. \"Since Gabe suggested I take my glasses off.\" I said all guilty. \"Oh, so thats why.\" she said. \"Yes and Mom before you jump to any conclusions I do not like Gabe.\" I said. \"I wasn't going to say that.\" she said and left my room. I think I've gone crazy. Then I heard the door knock, that must be Gabe. \"I'll go get it Mom.\" I said. I went to go answer the door and there was Gabe. \"Hey Anna.\" he said. \"Hey Gabe, ready to write?\" I said. \"Yeah.\" he said. \"Mom, Gabe and I will be in my room!\" I yelled. \"Okay Anna!\" she yelled back. We went up to my room and at my desk. \"I see your still have your contacts on.\" he said. \"Yeah well, I thought about and you wear right it is a good change.\" I said. \"See what did I say.\" he said. I laughed. Yesterday we did the second part of the song. Now we were writing the chores, and the last part of the song. Then we took a little break. \"So Anna why haven't seen you sing out in public?\" he asked. \"I-I don't know, and what do you mean? You have seen me sing in public.\" I said. \"Yeah in class, but I meant like at a party, dance, or club. You know like a crowd.\" he said. \"Okay I may not sing to a crowd, but…\"I tailed off. I didn't know what to say. \"you're afraid to sing to a crowd.\" he finished. And he was right again. \"Fine I am.\" I said quietly. \"I want to sing to people, but I don't know if they will like my music.\" I said. \"Well you'll never know if you don't try.\" he said. \"And if it make you feel better I still feel nervous every time I go on stage.\" he said. I didn't know Gabe would be nervous. \"Since when do you get nervous. You get to sing and be yourself to people and I can't.\" I said. \"Probably because I'm not being myself.\" he said. What? \"I sing, but I'm not being myself. I just give them what they want.\" he explain. \"You know if you give them what them want they'll never get to know the real you.\" I said. \"You want to know something weird?\" he asked. \"What's weird?\" I asked. I think I know what it was. \"We aren't even arguing or anything like that.\" he said. I knew it. \"Yeah, I guess we're not so different after all.\" I said as we smiled at each other. I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but I was willing to take a risk. Next Day Lunch Time Everyone heard music coming from the front of the school and rushed to see what was happening. Audrey and I noticed everyone was dancing to the music from the Slam FM car speakers as we headed towards Tara, who was leaning against the wall. \"Tara,\" I said. \"What is happening?\" asked Audrey. \"Well no one can't complain about us missing class, because it's lunch.\" answered Tara as she smirked. \"This was your idea?\" asked Audrey and Tara nodded. \"It's awesome.\" I said with excitement. Then we saw Cammi Q with a mic in her hand. \"Hey hey hey Lincoln Bay! This is Cammi Q comin at you live, y'all feelin good today?\" said Cammi Q and everyone cheered. \"Alright listen up I got a special message from our good friend Radio Rebel.\" said Cammi Q. Then she pressed something from inside the car for the message to play. \"This Radio Rebel comin at you with a little lunch time surprise.\" said Tara as Radio Rebel through the speakers. I turned around and saw Stacey and Kim heading towards the GGGG's. I could tell Stacey was mad about this. \"Now a lot of you have IM'd me about the powers to be taking away our music and it feels like a part of ourselves has been taken away.\" said Tara and everyone booed. \"Well that's not gonna make us better students and you can't punish someone for relaxing during their down time right principal Moreno. You stole our music and I'm giving it back, text and request. Lunch time is our time.\" said Tara. Everyone cheered and danced. I turned to Stacey and the GGGG's again. Stacey seemed more mad then every and some of the guys started to dance. Gabe saw me and we smiled at each other. Good thing Stacey didn't see us. I turned back to Tara and Audrey and we started to dance as well. Finally I'm back. Hope you guys like this chapter. BTW for those of you wondering about the song Gabe and Anna are 'working' on I won't reveal it yet. Keep reading and reviewing and I'm glade to be back. xoxo[Chapter 6] After lunch everyone was heading to class. Tara sure does know how to throw a surprise. \"Can I have your attention please!\" shouted principal Moreno. Everyone stopped and faced her from up stairs. \"I want you all to know that this lunch time fiasco was a… fiasco. It is time for a certain DJ rain of rebel to come to an end.\" she said. What's going on? \"So, anyone with any information regarding the identity of this Radio Rebel. Is to report it to me immediately, or risk facing disciplinary action themselves. Now get to class.\" she finished. Oh great principal Moreno sure needs to calm down. I don't get what Tara did wrong. \"Anna did hear?\" asked Audrey. \"Yeah, as long as she doesn't know its Tara she's fine.\" I whispered. \"You're right. I hope Tara's okay.\" she said. \"Yeah I hope so too.\" I said then I gave a good bye hug to Audrey. I was about to head up stairs until, I saw Tara with a worried look on her face. \"Tara are you okay?\" I asked. \"Uh yeah I'm fine… I gotta go. See yeah.\" said Tara. I wonder what's wrong with her. I got up stairs and I ran into someone. \"Hey, watch where you're going.\" I heard someone say. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" I said. Then I saw, it was Stacey. \"Hey Stacey.\" I said. \"Where are your glasses four eyes.\" she asked mocking me and Kim was laughing. \"I left them at home.\" I said. \"Why you trying to fit with us, geek.\" she said. \"No, I just decided not to wear them and in case you wondering I'm wearing my contacts.\" I said. No way was I telling her that it was Gabe's idea. \"Whatever it is. Its no going to work Anna you'll always be a geek.\" she said. \"I don't care at least I'm being myself.\" I said. I walked away form her and headed to class. Gabe's House I was heading over to Gabe's and I saw Gavin and the two other band members leaving the garage. \"Hey Gavin.\" I said. \"Hey uhh-.\" said Gavin. \"Anna, I'm Tara's friend.\" I said. \"Oh right.\" he said. \"Is Gabe here? He and I have homework to do.\" I asked. \"Yeah he's in the garage.\" he answered. \"Thanks.\" I said and entered in the garage. I saw Gabe with his guitar. \"Hey rockstar.\" I said. He turned. \"Hey Anna you're early. I thought you weren't coming for another half an hour.\" he said. \"Yeah well I was just too exited to see you… I mean I was too exited to rehears the song.\" I said all nervous. Why did I say that. \"Alright then lets rehears the song.\" he said. He grabbed two stools and his guitar. We started to sing and during the song I just could't help, but smile at Gabe and he kept his eyes on me. After we were done it was quite. I didn't know what to say. \"So, how was rehearsal with the band?\" I asked. \"It was good.\" he said. \"Gabe, you remember what you said to me yesterday about you not being yourself on stage.\" I said. \"I remember. What about it?\" he asked. \"Why don't you just be yourself on stage?\" I asked. It was quite again and then he answered. \"I don't know. I guess I'm afraid to show the real me.\" he said. \"Sounds like someone I know.\" I said referring to myself. Then we heard to a door open and I saw Gabe's sister Lilly. \"Gabe Mom needs your help in the kitchen.\" she said. \"Tell her I'll be there in a minute.\" he said. Then she left. \"Hey Anna, do you want to stay for dinner? If you want.\" he asked. \"I don't know, maybe, I'll have to call my Mom first.\" I said. \"Okay, but I'll be in the kitchen alright.\" he said and he left. I called my mom and she said yes, since she was working late. I went in and I saw Gabe helping his mom with the groceries. Then she saw me. \"Gabe who is this?\" she asked. \"Mom, this is Anna a girl in my music class.\" he said. \"Well its nice to meet you Anna.\" she said. \"You too Ms. LaViolet\" I said. \"Mom is it okay if Anna could joins us for dinner?\" he asked his mom. \"Well I guess its fine.\" she said. I stayed from dinner and it was pretty cool. Gabe's mom kinda reminds me of my Mom, and his sister Lilly is the sweetest little girl I met. After dinner I helped Gabe's mom with the dishes and Gabe went outside to throw away the trash bag. \"So Anna, are you dating Gabe?\" she asked. My eyes widen when she asked that. \"Uhh, no he and I are just friends.\" I said. \"Oh well, it's just because he talks about all the time\" she said. Gabe has talked about me? That's really sweet. \"Really well, that nice of him.\" I said. Then I heard a bump coming outside and it was Gabe. \"Were you spying on us?\" I asked to him. \"What? No I wasn't.\" he said. Then I sprayed water on him. \"Hey! Okay then.\" he said. Then he threw water at me. All of a sudden we had a water fight. After that I was about to go home. \"Anna, you want me to drive you home?\" he asked. \"Uhh… sure I guess.\" I said. As Gabe drove me home it was pretty quite I got so nervous. Then he pulled over in front of my house. \"Thanks for the ride.\" I said. \"Yeah well I'm glade you came over, and I can't believe what my mom said.\" he said. \"About you and me.\" I said. \"Yeah, that was…\" he trailed off. \"akaward.\" I finished. \"Yeah. It was.\" he said. \"Gabe, I don't know why, but I kinda feel a little different around you, in a good way.\" I said. \"That's funny, because I feel the same way as well.\" he said. We stared at each other for a while till I realized I needed to go. \"I gotta go, I'll see yeah tomorrow.\" I said getting out of the car. \"Yeah see yeah tomorrow.\" he said and drove off. In my room. After Gabe left I started to write that song in my music book again. This time I came up with this. But now that I get you I know fear is what it really was \"Hey Anna\" I heard and I saw my Mom. \"Hey Mom.\" I said. \"How was your night with Gabe?\" she asked. \"It was cool.\" I said. \"Are you two are getting along?\" she asked. \"Yeah Mom we are and its not so bad.\" I said. \"Well I'm glade you two are getting along.\" she said. \"Yeah me too.\" I said. \"Good night.\" she said. \"Good night Mom.\" I said and she left the room. As the week kept on passing by not only was Tara growing more popular as Radio Rebel, but so were my feelings for Gabe. Like how much we loved music that I showed him every single song I wrote in my song book, and he showed me every song he wrote as well. Or how much we cared about our freinds and family that we do anything for them. I feel more confident being around him. That he started to help me with that song in my song book. I guess I was wrong about him being a jerk, he actually is really sweet, funny, and caring. At School Audrey and I found out that Tara aka \"Radio Rebel\" was nominated for prom queen. So we were looking for her and found her. \"Tara we have news!\" I said with excitement. \"But we can't talk here.\" whispered Audrey. \"What?\" said Tara. Then we dragged her to the janitors closet. \"Um I'm sorry but could you give us a second.\" said Audrey to the janitor. \"But this is my office.\" he said. Then Audrey nudged her head towards the door and he left, and I shut the door. \"So guess who got nominated for prom queen.\" I said. \"Stacey\" said Tara. \"You did.\" said Audrey. \"Well not you.\" I said. \"Radio Rebel!\" We squealed. \"This is horrible, the whole point of Radio Rebel is that she's anonymous remember. What's gonna happen if she wins? Who's gonna go up there and accept the crown? I could get expelled. I have to put a stop to this\"said Tara. \"Are you crazy you can't quit now.\" said Audrey. \"Yeah this is your moment.\" I said. Then the door opened and we turned ours heads. \"Not now Mr. Mcgowski.\" said Audrey. \"But I need the broom.\" he said then Audrey handed him the broom and closed the door. \"Audrey, Anna, I can't do this anymore.\" said Tara. \"You can.\" we said. \"I can't.\" \"You can.\" The door opened again. We all turned around and said \"Not now.\" \"But I need the dustpan too.\" said Mr. Mcgowski. Then Tara gave it to him and Audrey closed to the door again. \"Your a hero to people and that's why they nominated you.\" said Audrey. \"Yeah and you can't turn your back on them now, this is your time to shine.\" I said. \"What if I don't wanna shine? What if shining really isn't my thing?\" asked Tara. \"As your BFFTLEWE we're legally obligated to make sure you do the show.\" said Audrey. \"Even if we have to drag you there.\" I said. Tara chuckled and left the closet. We all left in a different direction. \"Hey Anna.\" I heard and it was Gabe. \"Hey Gabe.\" I said. \"I'll see you after school.\" he said. Oh great I forgot to cancel on Gabe, since Tara was going to take me and Audrey to SLAM FM after school. \"I might have to reschedule on that. I have to, uh, help my friends with, homework after school.\" I said all nervous. \"Okay then, call me when your done alright.\" he said. \"Okay\" I said \"See yeah later.\" he said \"Yeah, see yeah.\" I said. Then I left. Why do I get nervous around him? I feel like an idiot every time I talk to him. At least I can hang out with Tara and Audrey after school. Sorry this chapter took so long but I had writers block on this one. Anyways I'll be back to school soon, but I'll still keep on writing this. Song in this chapter: Give Your Heart A Break - Demi Lovato - Unbroken I do not own song lyrics and thanks for all the nice reviews I'm glade you guys like this story. Keep on reading and reviewing. xoxo[Chapter 7] After School at SLAM FM \"Remind me why we had to park so far away?\" asked Audrey. \"Because we can't risk anybody recognizing the car.\" said Tara. \"Or us?\" I asked. \"Yes. Alright now wig me.\" said Tara. And we stared to put on some wigs. Tara had a blond wig, Audrey had a brown wig, and I had a black wig. Then we put on some trench coasts and headed to the back of SLAM FM. By the time we went inside we took off our wigs and coats and Tara showed us to the studio. \"This is where the magic happens.\" she said. \"No way,\" I said. \"This is so cool.\" said Audrey. I can't believe this is where Tara does her show. \"Is this the famous Audrey Sharma and Anna Rosen?\" asked Cammi as she walked in and gives us a hug. \"It's so nice to meet you both.\" she said. \"You too.\" we both said. Then the door opened and we turned to see Rob. \"Could you girls excuse us for a moment?\" he asked motioning to Tara. Audrey, Cammi and I nodded and left the room. We stood by the wall and started to talk. \"Anna I'm glad you came.\" said Audrey. \"Why would't I come?\" I asked. \"Because you been spending a lot of time with 'you know who.'\" she said. I shrugged at who she meant. \"Who is this 'you know who?'\" asked Cammi. \"Oh its this guy at school she likes his name is Gabe.\" she said. I covered my face and started to blush. \"Thanks a lot Audrey.\" I said uncovering my face. \"Hey there's nothing wrong with having a crush on a guy you like.\" said Cammi. I felt a little better about that. \"Yeah like Tara has a crush on\" said Audrey. \"Gavin.\" I said. \"See your not the only one with a crush.\" said Cammi. I guess they were right and I still get to see Gabe after the show. After our that Rob came out and we headed back in the studio. Audrey and I followed Cammi to another room and sat on the chairs next to her. She handed some headset for us and Tara was about to do the show. \"A lot of you wanna know who I am, I get that and maybe it'd be easier if you could see my face. But see you guys it's not about me, it's about you so you don't need to know my name. You wanna know who I am? I am somebody who's tired of being afraid and, I know it can hold you back. So just, say what you're afraid of. Call in. I dare you\" A few seconds later nobody called in. \"I guess everyone's too afraid to say what they're afraid of. Maybe this song will inspire you-\" Cammi notice people calling and knock on the window to tell Tara. \"Lines 1-20!\" she said. \"You're on with Radio Rebel.\" said Tara as she talked to the caller. There many people calling in and then came Gavin. \"I'm afraid to do my own thing.\" said Gavin. \"I was too,\" said Tara. \"Was? So, what changed?\" he asked. \"I guess when I started doing the show I realized you're not as alone as you feel. You can remember that then it makes it easier to take a risk, do your own thing.\" she said. \"Thanks\" he said and hung up. \"We're gonna take some more calls in a minute, but in the mean time you guys are gonna seriously dig this song.\" said Tara and played a song. She took off her headset and headed for the door. Audrey and I ran out the room to know where she was going. \"Hey, where you going?\" asked Audrey. \"Just somewhere, to do something.\" she said as she left. \"I'm afraid of hyenas.\" said Audrey then she turned to me. \"What about you Anna?\" she asked. I thought about it and said my one fear. \"I'm afraid of sining in front of a crowd.\" After the show I went home and called Gabe to come over, but he said he was already there. How did he get in? \"Gabe where are you?\" I said heading inside. \"I'm in the kitchen with you mom.\" he said and I headed to the kitchen. Of course my mom was home. I hope she didn't do anything embarrassing. \"Hey mom, Gabe\" I said nervous. \"Honey I hope you didn't mind but your boyfriend came early and I gave him some cookies I made. I know there your favorite.\" she said. \"Mom! He's not my boyfriend and its okay.\" I said. I grabbed Gabe's arm. \"Come on we have to work on our song Gabe.\" I said \"Alright then. And thanks for the cookies Ms. Rosen.\" he said. \"Any time Gabe.\" she said and I pulled him up to my room. We went in and sat on my bed. \"I'm sorry about my mom.\" I said. \"Its okay, so you think you're ready to sing\" he asked. \"Yeah let's sing\" I said. He grabbed his guitar and we stared to sing. After we were finished rehearsal we just started to chat. I always felt happy to talk to him and be myself. \"You want to know something weird.\" he said. \"Whats weird?\" I asked feeling nervous. \"We have been hanging out for a few weeks now and we haven't try to kill each other.\" he said. I stated to giggle. \"You have a point. Which brings me to this. Why did you hate me?\" I asked. It was quiet for a moment. \"I may had a crush on you back in middle school and the only way I could get your attention was to be mean to you. And I guess I lost that feeling as we got to high school.\" he answered. I was surprised that I started to blush. \"Oh uh thats a… surprise\" I said. \"Yeah but don't worry we're just friends, right.\" he said. \"Yeah we're just friends.\" I said a little disappointed. \"And know its your tune why did you hate me?\" he asked me. \"Well… I just hated how you were a jerk to me and I thought you only cared about being popular.\" I answered. \"Well I guess should't have been mean to you and I'm not that into being popular. And I'm sorry for being mean to you.\" he apologize. \"I accept your apology and I'm sorry too.\" I said. \"So we're good?\" he asked. \"We're good.\" I said. \"By the way are you going to prom?\" he asked. I froze for a second. \"I don't know maybe. Why are you going?\" I asked. \"Yeah my band and I are playing and Gavin and I are nominated for prom king.\" he said. \"Oh yeah, plus Stacey and Radio Rebel are nominated for prom queen.\" I said. \"Yeah. Well I hope you go I like to see you there.\" he said. I guess I am going to prom. Then he checked his watch. I guess he had to go. \"I gotta go I have band practice.\" he said getting up. \"Oh okay.\" I said. Then we went down stairs to the front door. \"I'll see ya tomorrow\" he said. \"Yeah see ya tomorrow\" I said. And we gave each other a hug. I didn't want to let go. We let go and he left. I went up to my room and started to play this new song I just finished. So you were never a saint. I love the shades of wrong. We learn to live with the pain. Mostly of broken hearts. But this love is great and wild. And I never saw you coming And I'll never be the same This is a state of grace This is a worth while fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right I guess the girls were right, I do have a crush on Gabe. I just hope Stacey doesn't find out. Hey guys! Sorry for not updating but ever since school stated I've been busy, I've been having some family problems and I also had some writes block. Song State of Grace - Taylor Swift - Red (Loved this song it reminded me of how Anna was feeling for Gabe and I knew this had to be in this story) And don't worry like I said before I'll keep on writing this. xoxo[Chapter 8] Hey everyone Happy New Years and heres a new chapter The Next Day at School \" This is your principal, there's been some controversy about the identity of Radio Rebel, and there nothing more distracting than controversy, now I gave her the chance to do the right thing and turn herself in, but she chose to hide avoiding the consequences of her insubordination. Well she can't hide forever which is why until Radio Rebel identity is revealed, I'm canceling the prom \" said Principal Marino over the speaker. Everyone was in shock and began to chat about this. \" For everyone. Now do you think there's favoritism at Linkin Bay \" said Principal Marino. This is so bad. I wonder what Tara is going to do. After school at SLAM FM There was a crowd of people from school protesting for Radio Rebel aka Tara to reveal her identity. Tara, Audrey, and I were in the middle of the crowd tryin to get in. \"How are we gonna get in?\" said Tara. Then we saw Cammi we mouthed her for help. Then she held up a finger and mouthed to hold on. \"Who do you blame for your prom getting canceled?\" a reporter asked Tara. Audrey and I looked over and saw Cammi covering her face. \"Look everyone it's Radio Rebel!\" shouted Audrey. Then everyone ran after Cammi as Tara, Audrey, and I ran inside. After we got inside we dropped the signs and headed to the studio. On the Show \"Hey out there in Radio land, a lot's happened since we last hung out? Let me know call me, text me, scroll on my wall, let me know how you feel.\" said Tara. A lot of people blamed her for prom being canceled I could't just let this happen to Tara. \"Okay, you guys are being honest about how you feel.\" said Tara and clicked on another caller \"You're on line 2.\" \"I've always liked you Radio Rebel, your playlists totally rock but…\" said Gavin. \"Go ahead, let it out.\" said Tara. \"It's just there's a girl I was hoping to impress that night.\" he said and Audrey whispered \"Stacey\" \"Sorry about that.\" said Tara. \"Yeah, me too.\" he said and hung up. \"Well I guess you guys are pretty upset, I'll uh just play some music.\" said Tara and played a song. \"This one's for you guys, thanks for being honest with me and sorry I let you down.\" Tara finished. Then Rob came in the room. \"Their just angry, you know they'll come around. It doesn't take away from all the good things you've done as Radio Rebel.\" he said. \"Did you hear them? They hate me, I ruined their prom. I feel horrible.\" said Tara. \"You didn't ruin it that principal did.\" said Cammi. \"I knew she was angry, but I didn't know she was gonna do something like this.\" said Tara. \"Man that Moreno's such a backwards thinker.\" said Cammi. \"Backwards, that's brilliant.\" said Tara. \"What?\" asked Cammi. \"Backwards, backwards\" Tara repeated looking at me and Audrey, we were confused. After the show we got to the entrance and everyone was still there. \"I thought they'd be gone by now.\" said Tara. \"Well what are going to do?\" I asked. Then Tara noticed the dancing sandwich \"This calls for a professional.\"she said and dragged us behind a desk. \"Somebody order the meaty subtacular?\" asked the sandwich. \"Hello?\" he asked leaning over the desk, then we popped up. \"Hi, could you do us a favor?\" asked Tara. \"Uh you want extra mariner?\" he asked. \"Oh that would be awesome.\" said Audrey. \"Audrey\" Tara and I said. \"And focusing I am the hyena.\" she said. \"You see those girls out there? We need to get out there without any of them seeing us.\" said Tara. \"You can count on me.\" he said. As the sandwich distracted the crowd, Tara, Audrey and I sneaked out the back door. I wonder what Tara meant by backwards. Next Morning at School I was in class and I saw Gabe waiting for me. \"Hey\" I said nervous. \"Hey. Did you hear about prom being canceled?\" he said. \"Yeah that sucks.\" I said. \"Yeah, Anna could I ask you something-\" he said. Then something came on the speaker. \" Good mooring Lincoln Bay High School, This is Cammi Q from SLAM FM bringing you a special message form… \" she said \" Radio Rebel here, now I wanna let you guys know that you really unleashed your fury about the prom drama and I want you to know you're totally been heard. Canceling prom was monumentally unfair but blaming Moreno isn't going to solve anything. I wanna do something about it and so does SLAM which is why were giving you guys what you want, your prom back \" said Tara. Everyone in class was cheering, Gabe gave me a small high five. I kinda wish he gave me a hug. \" SLAM FM is throwing it's first ever mrop, that's prom spelt backwards because were turing prom upside down. Tickets are free and everyone is invited so don't worry about finding a date or spending you college savings on a dress or a tux or limo, just come as you are because that's the way we like you. \" \"Uh Gabe you wanted to ask me something.\" I said. \"Uh never mind its not important, but are you comin over to work on the song\" he said. \"Yeah I will.\" I said. At Gabe's House We were working on the song and listening to Radio Rebel. \" So I've been getting billon questions about the morp which rules cuz you all seem stoked to go. Which is the whole point right? A party were everyone feels like royalty, but then again maybe we should crown a morp King and Queen. I mean after all people were nominated. So if that's what you want then that's what we'll do, morp is all your's so make sure to vote for your favorite morp King and Queen, make your voices heard. Especially my number one fan. \" said Tara. \"Do you think I should call Radio Rebel if the GGGG's could play at morp?\" Gabe asked \"I think you should, you guys were suppose to play at prom why not play at morp.\" I said. Gabe called Tara if the GGGG's could perform at morp and she said yes and to any who would like to perform. \"Anna you should perform at morp.\" said Gabe. I stared at him thinking he's nuts. \"Uh no I'm not performing at morp. I told you I can't sing in front of a crowd.\" I said. \"Common you told me you were afraid of people not liking your music. What else could you be afraid of?\" he said. \"Of stage fright, the last time I sang in front of a crowd was when I was 8 years old. It was about 100 people by the time I was suppose to sing I ran and threw up on the side of the stage.\" I said. \"Wow you must have been terrified.\" he said. \"I was and it was the most embarrassing thing I have done. From then on I never sang in front of a huge crowd ever again.\" I said. \"Then how are able to sing in front a small crowd?\" he asked. \"I guess there's less pressure sing in front of a small crowd.\" I said. \"You know I have a few tricks on getting ride of stage fright.\" he said. \"How?\" I asked. \"I usually get lost in the music, or sometimes I imagine myself in a happy place.\" he said. I kinda gave him confused look over the second one. \"I know the second one is silly, but it helps.\" he said. \"Believe me its not silly at all.\" I said. \"Anna, if you sing at morp. I think you'll finally come out of your shell.\" he said. \"I don't know Gabe what if everyone will hate me.\" I said. \"Trust me you have a great voice and I think people will like you.\" he said. I'll go to morp, but no way am I sing in front of the whole school. Hey guys a new year and new chapter. BTW I'm almost done with this story and I promise I'll finish this. Plus follow me on twitter JTButterfly101 Keep on reading and reviewing xoxo.[Chapter 9] The Next Day at School Audrey and I were at lunch while Tara was rehearsing with Gavin and Stacey. \"So how are you and Gabe doing on your song?\" Audrey asked. \"Great we just keep on getting better and better.\" I said. Then someone came behind us. \"Audrey, Anna\" said the person. We turned around and it was Kim. \"Yeah\" We both said. \"Stacey would like to invite you two, and Tara to her party tonight.\" she said. \"Okay, but I don't Tara will go she's…\" I trailed off I didn't what to say. \"has plans with her parents.\" said Audrey. 'Thanks' I mouthed to her. \"Well Stacey said she has to be there or else her secret will be reveled. See you guys there.\" said Kim and she walked away. \"How did Stacey know about Tara's secret?\" I asked Audrey. \"Well yesterday I heard she called Stacey her number one fan in class, and I guess she said it on the show.\" said Audrey. \"I hope Tara has an idea on this.\" I said worried. There's no way Tara can be in two places at once. At Stacey's Party I parked my car and headed to Stacey's house. It was pretty strange to be at her house I hadn't been here since sixth grade. \"Hey\" I heard and it was Tara standing next to me. \"What are you doing here? What about your show?\" I asked. \"I got it all covered. My mom and Cammi have my back.\" she said. She told me about her plan and I thought it was brilliant plan. Then we headed into Stacey's house. \"Hi\" Tara and I said as we walked in. \"Here I am\" said Tara. \"So I see, but I'm still watching you.\" said Stacey to Tara. We headed to the living room and sat next to Audrey. Everybody from school was there to find out who is Radio Rebel. \"This is Radio Rebel live from SLAM FM, tonight is all about you. Lines are open, you know the number.\" we heard the radio. \"I'm calling into the show.\" said Stacey as she dialed the number. \"How are you here and there?\" asked Audrey. \"You're on with Radio Rebel\" said Tara's voice \"Do you know you are a hypocrite\" said Stacey. \"Hi, what's your name caller.\" said Tara's voice. \"Save it, you say you're all about the people, but Morp is all about you. Know you get to log more queen votes on the radio every night, not fair, the other Morp nominees show get equal air time, meaning me.\" said Stacey. \"I totally hear you,\" said Tara. \"You here me I don't think you do.\" said Stacey. \"Say what you want to say\" said Tara. \"I think your brain washing the whole school to get people to vote for you. So I'm gonna take this opportunity to get the school to vote for me Stacey for Morp Queen\" said Stacey. \"High what's your name caller?\" said Tara. Oh no. \"You already asked me that.\" said Stacey. There was a pause and Stacey looked at Tara. Then went back to her phone. \"Thanks for calling.\" said Tara. \"I'm not done with you…\" Stacey went on. Then Tara got up and went somewhere. \"Why so quiet does the truth hurt.\" said Stacey. \"You wanna know the truth?\" asked Tara. Then there was a knock \"Stop hogging the bathroom\" said a guy. \"What was that?\" asked Stacey. \"I knocked over my chair, so I could get close to the mic so you could hear me clearly.\" said Tara. Stacey try to look for Tara, but Tara was clever enough to hid from her. \"I have a better idea, why don't you come forward and stop hiding like a cowered.\" said Stacey. \"Would a cowered be afraid to go up against you for Morp Queen cause I'm not. I'll see you there and you'll see that I'm not afraid of anything. Thanks for calling.\" Tara finished. Then everyone was heading outside for the GGGG's. Tara came a little later and met up with me and Audrey. \"That was amazing, she was freaked out.\" said Audrey Gavin then smiled at Tara \"And Gavin just smiled at you\" I said to Tara. \"I think it was more of a general smile\" she said \"It seemed pretty specific to me \" said Audrey. Before the GGGG's began to play Gabe saw me and smiled at me. I blushed and smiled back at him. \"We're the GGGG's and this is We So Fly\" said Gabe and started to play. They rock I guess I should have never judge them. \"Anna, since when did you like the GGGG's?\" asked Tara. \"Since she started to like Gabe.\" said Audrey. I nodded and smiled at Gabe again. Then someone bumped from behind me, I turn to see Stacey. \"Are you kidding me\" she said. \"I didn't do anything you bumped into me.\" I said. \"You come to my house and you spilled your drink on me. This cost a fortune!\" she snapped at me. I was speechless. \"It was an accident Stacey. Anna would never do something like that, unlike some people.\" said Tara. \"Do you know what your problem is-\" \"You know what, I don't care what you think my problem is. Keep it to yourself.\" Tara said. Stacey was speechless. \"I need a new outfit. Kim lets go.\" she said heading inside. \"Thanks for that Tara.\" I said and hugged her. \"I like how Radio Rebel is rubbing off on you too\" said Audrey as we turned back to the GGGG's. Later at the Party There a few people at the party and Tara and I stayed to talk to Gavin and Gabe. \"Okay you can do it just go over there\" said Tara. \"You can do it Tara.\" I said. She turned around and there was Gavin. \"Hey\" he said \"Well I'll just go over there.\" I said walking away. Then I bumped into Gabe. \"Hey Anna.\" he said. \"Hey, you guys rock.\" I said. \"Thanks I was nervous and afraid of messing up.\" he said. \"Trust me you didn't mess up.\" I said. I started to shiver that I crossed my arms. \"Are you cold?\" he asked. \"Yeah but its no big deal.\" I said. \"No just wear my jacket.\" he said and took his jacket off and put it around me. \"Thanks.\" I said. \"Your welcome, so you nervous about our song tomorrow.\" he said. \"A little, what about you?\" I asked \"A little. You know we're not so different after all, I mean we both love music, and we both share the same dream.\" he said. \"You're right I never thought we have a lot in common.\" I said. \"By the way you look nice I'm glade you came tonight.\" he said. \"Thanks and I didn't want to miss you… and the band. Well I should get going.\" I said. I was about to leave until Gabe pulled me back. \"Wait Anna\" he said. He wrapped his arms around my waist, leaned down and kiss me. I kissed him back and wrapped my arms around his neck. Then we pulled away. \"Whoa, what just happened.\" I said back away from him. \"I-I didn't mean to I'm sorry.\" he said. \"Don't be I liked.\" I said. \"Oh uh, great. I should go\" he said \"Wait what about your jacket\" I said. \"Keep it, you give it back to me tomorrow.\" he said. \"Oh, well okay.\" I said. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" he said. \"Yeah see you tomorrow.\" I said and he left. I can't believe I kissed Gabe I could even move or help but smile. \"Anna you ready to go.\" said Tara. \"Yeah lets go home.\" I said. After I dropped Tara off at her house I drove home thinking about Gabe. After I got home I went to my room going over the lyrics to the song Gabe and I had to perform tomorrow. \"Hey Anna\" my mom said sanding at my door. \"Hey Mom\" I said. \"You okay you look confused?\" she asked. \"Mom, I think I like Gabe. I never felt this way over a guy before\" I said. \"Anna its okay for you to like Gabe. If you like a guy you should tell, if you don't you'll never know what might have been.\" she said. She was I had to tell Gabe. \"Your right and Mom thanks.\" I said. \"Your welcome sweetie. Goodnight and don't say up too late.\" she said closing my door. \"I won't\" I said. After looking over the song I grabbed my song book, pencil, and guitar. The day I first met you You told me you'd never fall in love But now that I get you I know fear is what it really was Now here we are, so close Yet so far, haven't I passed the test? When will you realize Baby, I'm not like the rest Don't wanna break your heart I wanna give your heart a break I know you're scared it's wrong Like you might make a mistake There's just one life to live And there's no time to waste, to waste So let me give your heart a break Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break Oh, yeah yeah On Sunday, you went home alone There were tears in your eyes I called your cell phone, my love But you did not reply The world is ours, if you want it We can take it, if you just take my hand There's no turning back now Baby, try to understand Don't wanna break your heart Wanna give your heart a break I know you're scared it's wrong Like you might make a mistake There's just one life to live And there's no time to waste, to waste So let me give your heart a break Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break There's just so much you can take Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break Oh, yeah yeah When your lips are on my lips And our hearts beat as one But you slip right out of my fingertips Every time you run, whoa Don't wanna break your heart Wanna give your heart a break I know you're scared it's wrong Like you might make a mistake There's just one life to live And there's no time to waste, to waste So let me give your heart a break Cuz you've been hurt before I can see it in your eyes You try to smile it away Some things, you can't disguise Don't wanna break your heart Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache So, let me give your heart a break Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break There's just so much you can take Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break Oh yeah,yeah The day I first met you You told me you'd never fall in love I finished the song I had trouble with and I now knew this song was about Gabe.

BTW the next chapter is Anna and Gabe's song I hope you are are exited for that. Song in this chapter: Give Your Heart A Break - Demi Lovato - Unbroken I do not own song lyrics and thanks for reading. Keep on reading and reviewing xoxo.[Chapter 10] Hey guys I'm sorry for not updating I have busy with school, and One Direction. Yeah I'm a directioner, anyways here is a new chapter. Next Day at School Gabe didn't mention anything about the kiss last night, I wonder why? I guess he was nervous to say anything about it. Gabe and I were almost up to perform to the class. There were some great duets that I was even more nervous to perform. \"You okay?\" asked Gabe. \"I'm nervous I don't think I can do this.\" I said. \"Common you can do this we rehears this song so many times. I know you can do this.\" he said. I smiled at him and then we were next. \"Up next is Gabe and Anna.\" said the teacher. Gabe grabbed his guitar and we went in front of the class \"Our song is called Everything Has Changed\" I said. I took a deep breath and we began. All I knew this morning when I woke Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before And all I've seen Since 18 hours ago His green eyes and freckles and your smile In the back of my mind making me feel like I just want to know you better Know you better, know you better now I just want to know you better Know you better, know you better now I just want to know you better Know you better, know you better now I just want to know you, know you, know you Cause all I know is we said hello And your eyes look like coming home, oh I know it's a simple name, Everything has changed All I know is you held the door You'll be mine and I'll be yours, oh I know since yesterday, Cause everything has changed. And all my walls stand tall painted blue But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down And open up the door for you And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies, The beautiful kind making up for lost time Taking flight making me feel like I just want to know you better Know you better, know you better now I just want to know you better Know you better, know you better now I just want to know you better Know you better, know you better now I just want to know you, know you, know you Cause all I know is we said hello And your eyes look like coming home, oh I know it's a simple name, Everything has changed All I know is you held the door You'll be mine and I'll be yours, oh I know since yesterday, Cause everything has changed. Come back and tell me why I'm feeling like I missed you all this time And meet me there tonight And let me know that it's not all in my mind. I just want to know you better Know you better know you better now I just want to know you, know you, know you All I know is we said hello Your eyes look like coming home, oh I know it's a simple name, Everything has changed All I know is you held the door You'll be mine and I'll be yours, oh I know since yesterday, Is everything has changed. All I know is we said hello So dust off your highest toes All I know is pouring rain, And everything has changed All I know is a new found grace All my dates I'll know your face All I know since yesterday is everything has changed After the song everyone clapped and I was happy to sing with Gabe. \"Well done you two A+ and now class the rest of the time is yours.\" said the teacher. Gabe and I were thinking of seeing Tara and Gavin's performance in drama, but we couldn't leave the class. So we came up with an excuse to leave. Gabe said he needed to go to the bathroom while I said I forgot something in my locker. \"It worked.\" he said with a smirk. I blushed. \"Hey do you think I can go to my locker I want to give you your jacket from last night.\" I said. \"Sure go ahead I'll be waiting and I want to ask you something.\" he said and headed to the auditorium. I went to my locker and grabbed Gabe's jacket and I slipped in the CD I made him last night into his pocket. I wonder what he wanted to ask me. I think he was going to ask me to go to Morp with him. I couldn't wait. I headed to the back statge and I saw Gabe with Gavin and the two other guys form the GGGG's. \"Dude, ready to rock out with the drama dorks?\" he said. \"That's funny, have you guys seen Tara? She's late.\" said Gavin. That's weird Tara is never late. \"Move on already! Pay attention to Stacey.\" said Gabe. I was shocked. \"You're turning into a real jerk you know that don't you?\" said Gavin, Gabe chucked. \"Me?\" he asked. \"Yeah\" said Gavin. \"Your the one who needs to get his priority's straight.\" said Gabe. \"Or what? Your gonna kick me out of the band.\" said Gavin. \"Is that what you want?\" asked Gabe. \"What I want is for you drop this stupid Rockstar act for five minutes and just try try to be a normal person.\" said Gavin. I didn't know Gabe was sill acting like that. \"Okay I am the front man of this band, this Rockstar act is that put us on the map, if you don't wanna be part of that then that's fine with us\" said Gabe. \"What happened to G's for life?\" asked Gavin. \"Hmm yeah ask yourself that, enjoy your solo career Gavin.\" said Gabe. I hid behind a curtain and Gabe turned to his two band mates. \"How was your duet with Anna?\" one of them asked. \"It was okay nothing special at least I don't have to see her ever again.\" said Gabe, and they laughed. I was crushed and then I came out of the curtain. Gabe saw me and I ran out. Gabe came after me and I had no choice, but turn to him. \"Anna I didn't mean it.\" he said. \"You didn't mean it. I heard what you said to Gavin and that you don't want see me.\" I said. \"I just don't think we should be seen in public.\" he said. \"I can't believe you. I thought after getting to know you I get to know the real you and like you, but I guess I was wrong.\" I said. \"Wait you like me, more than just a friend?\" he said. \"Yes, but now I don't I should have know. You haven't changed a bit your still the same jerk I hate.\" I said. \"But Anna I-\" he said. \"Save it Gabe. If you wanted to ask me to Morp the answer is no. I never want to see you ever again.\" I said throwing his jacket a him and ran down the hallway. I couldn't stop crying I couldn't believe Gabe would say that to me I should have known. After I stopped crying I saw Tara running out of the Janitor's closet after the janitor open the door. \"Hey Tara\" I shouted. \"What happen\" I asked. \"I was in the Janitor's closet Stacey locked me in there.\" said Tara. \"You should hurry up I think you and Gavin are up next.\" I said. We ran throughout the back door of the stage and saw Stacey kiss Gavin. Gavin saw Tara and walked out. I saw Stacey heading toward Tara and I hid behind the curtains. \"Oh no look he is so disappointed in you, and who can blame him.\" said Stacey. She pushed Tara further back and glared at her. \"Okay Radio Drivel, you were bad enough when you didn't talk, but trying to destroy me on your stupid radio show, did you really think you'd get away with that?\" she said. How did she know. \"Look your wrong I'm not her-\" said Tara and was cut off by Stacey. \"Save it, your not her? Then explain this.\" she pressed something on her phone. \"I was afraid we biffed the call, Tara was right you really can be in two places at ones.\" said Tara's mom and Cammi Q. This is bad. \"That doesn't prove anything\" said Tara. \"No? Then you won't mind if I e-mail it to the whole school and Moreno?\" said Stacey. \"What do you want?\" asked Tara. \"Morp queen, your gonna make sure I win, or Radio Rebel is, tell everyone on your show to vote for me, and if you tell anyone about this little private moment. I'll tell everyone who you really are\" said Stacey before walking away. I came out of the curtains and hugged Tara. After School When I got home I just laid on my bed still upset about Gabe. I turned on to the radio to listen to Tara. \"Okay, I had a bad day, it kinda shook me up made me wonder, am I doing the right thing, I mean is it worth it if I get expelled? or if it messes things up with the guy I like, I don't know. But I do know that there will be people out there who try and take things away from us things bigger than prom, and we can just sit back and watch it happen. Or we can stand up for ourselves, I mean we all deserve to dance to our own playlists no matter what Moreno or anyone else has to say about it. Oh yeah and one more thing, I know that a lot of you guys wanna vote for me for Morp Queen to find out who I am. But I don't need that crown, but Stacy Debane she kinda does, just keep that in mind when you vote\" said Tara. I feel bad for her. Wait Stacey told Tara to not tell anyone what she said, but she didn't notice me hearing everything. I had to call Audrey and Gavin. Next Day I saw Gavin talking to Stacy. Stacey turned to me and the janitor behind me I guess Gavin told her about us knowing Tara locked in the closet. \"But we're going to be King and Queen.\" said Stacey. \"I don't want to be King. I never did.\" said Gavin walking away. I went up to Stacey to talk to her. \"I'm sorry about Gavin.\" I said. \"It doesn't matter Gabe the only one nominated for King now.\" she said. \"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"I saw you and Gabe kissing at my party, and I'm going to steal your boyfriend.\" she said. I was about to snap. \"Okay that's it Stacey!\" I shouted. \"Gabe is not my boyfriend and what have I ever done to you. I tried to be nice to you because I still want to be friends, but if this is how its going to be then I give up on you. Have fun at Morp.\" I said and walked away. I didn't care about Stacey and Gabe anymore I had to move on. At least I still have my friends with me and we're going to have a great time at Morp. Most importantly I hope Tara can finally tell everyone she is Radio Rebel. Alright this is my plan I'll finish this story tomorrow thats right I'll be posting the last chapter tomorrow. I do not own song lyrics Song in this chapter Everything Has Changed - Taylor Swift feat. Ed Shereen - Red Hope you guys like this chapter and it took me a long time to decide which song was perfect for Anna and Gabe. It was between Two Is Better Than One or Everything Has Changed. I knew this song represented them more, but that just my opinion. Keep on reading and reviewing. xoxo[Chapter 11] Alright guys here is the last chapter enjoy. BTW I changed the ending a little bit. Morp Everyone from school was at SLMA FM for Morp. I was with Audrey wondering where Tara was, I hope she came. \"Where's Tara?\" Audrey asked Barry and Larry. \"Uh more to the point where is Radio Rebel?\" asked Barry. \"Oh finally my true love shall be reveled. How do I look?\" Barry asked Larry. \"Uh a little green which could be the lighting or worse.\" he said offering some hand sanitizer to Barry and Audrey. \"I wonder where Tara is\" I said. Then we all looked up and saw Tara walking to us. She looked great. \"Hey guys\" she said. \"You look amazing.\" said Audrey. \"Fantastic\" I said. \"Thank you\" she said and pulled me and Audrey away from Barry and Larry. \"Have you seen Gavin I really should talk to him\" she said. \"Wait what are you gonna say\" said Audrey. \"I don't know\" said Tara and she started to panic. \"Are we missing something?\" asked Barry. \"Conference now.\" I said pulling Audrey and Tara. We went to the back stage. \"I don't know what to do I'm freaking out\" said Tara. \"Just breath.\" said Audrey. Tara breathed in and out slowly and nodded to us. \"Okay\" she said. We stood up, suddenly we stopped and saw Stacey looking at herself into a small mirror. \"You're beautiful. You're a queen no matter what happens.\" she said. She closed the mirror, took a deep breath, and walked away. I remember she would always do that when she was nervous. Then the girls looked at me. \"Anna were you and Stacey friends?\" asked Tara. I was afraid she asked me that and I couldn't lie to them. I had to tell the truth. \"Yes. I wanted to tell you, but I didn't know how to. Wait how did you know?\" I said. \"At the party I saw a picture of you two in her bedroom while I was hiding from her.\" said Tara. \"Oh wow\" I said. I can't believe she still had that picture. Maybe I should't have snapped at her. \"It's okay Anna we still love you.\" said Tara. Then Audrey and Tara hugged me. I'm happy to call them my best friends. Then we headed back out. \"Good evening Seattle, you ready to find out who your Morp queen is?\" Cammi asked from the stage, everyone cheered. \"It's time to see who will win the crowns at Lincoln Bay High\" she said \"We did have 2 nominations for Morp King but one dropped out... So that leave's Gabe LaViolet\" she said. I looked away and crossed my arms. \"And now I'd like to invite your Morp court princess's up here to join me on stage. Let's give it up to Stacey Debane\" said Cammi. Everyone cheered as Stacey went on stage. \"And Radio Rebel!\" everyone cheered, but Tara stayed with me and Audrey. \"Radio Rebel are you out there?\" asked Cammi. She looked at Tara and Tara shaked her head. \"Well I guess will continue. Your Morp Queen is…\" said Cammi opening the envelope, then I notice Tara walking to the back of the stage. \"Radio Rebel!\" shouted Cammi and everyone cheered. I think Tara is going to do it. \"Most of you don't know me, I'm the girl who sits in the back of the class and never raises her hand, who is so afraid of saying the wrong thing that she says nothing instead, the old me would have frozen in front of a crowd like this, but something happened, suddenly the real stuff we were dealing with at school became more important than my fears, look I wasn't sure I was gonna do this tonight, but I need to be true to myself so…\" said Tara and walk out into the stage. \"I'm Radio Rebel\" she said. Everyone was shocked at first, but then everyone cheered. Suddenly Principal Moreno walked onto the stage causing everyone to stop and took Tara's mic. \"Thank you or an enlightening evening, and now that I know who Radio Rebel is…\" she said pointing at Tara. \"She is defiantly getting expelled\" she said and everyone gasped. \"Enjoy your Morp Tara. Oh and don't bother coming to school on Monday.\" she said chuckling. This can't happen. \"I'm Radio Rebel!\" said Audrey. \"No, I'm Radio Rebel!\" said Gavin. \"No, I'm Radio Rebel!\" I said. Then everyone joined in. Moreno looked mad and annoyed and she gave Tara's mic back and walked off the stage and everyone cheered. \"I believe this belongs to you\" said Cammi handing Tara the crown. \"I mean since we're all Radio Rebel this crown belongs to all of us so congratulations kings and queens\" said Tara and everyone cheered. \"but there is someone who's been dreaming about this crown all of her life. Although I'm not sure if I heard her say she was Radio Rebel.\" said Tara walking over to Stacey. She took a second to think and said \"I'm Radio Rebel, I'm so Radio Rebel\" she said excitedly. \"Well then.\" said Tara and placed the crown on Stacey. She turned to audience and then to me. \"Anna could you come up here?\" she asked. I went up the stage and faced her. \"I'm sorry for being a bad friend to you and I should't have treated you like that. Could we be friends again because I need you. You're my best friend.\" she said. I thought about it, even though she was mean I knew she could change. \"Yes we can be best friends again.\" I said and we hugged. I was glade to have her back. After that almost everyone got crowns and went back to dancing. A few minutes later Gavin was about to perform. \"Everyone please give it up for Lincoln Bay's very own Gavin Morgan.\" Cammi introducing Gavin. \"There's a girl I've like for a while now, she's the girl who's not afraid to ask a dancing sandwich for help. She's the one who inspired this song, this song for her.\" said looking at Tara. Walls you can build all around Justto shield a piece of your world out of sight And I needed you to look through To the shadows I tried to burry inside Drawing them out to the light You showed me I got nothing here to hide Now I can be who I am Now I can stand up for everyone to see Takin this life in my hands Now I can be, Now I can be the real me Now I can be the real me Now I can be the real me Now I can be, Now I can be the real me During the song Gabe and the rest of the GGGG's got up on stage, I guess he and Gavin are friends again. \"Anna Rosen could you come up the stage.\" said Gabe. Why do I keep going up on stage? Gabe pulled me aside of the stage. \"You're going to sing that song you gave me.\" he said. I was about to faint. \"What no I'm not!\" I said trying to walk away, but Gabe pulled me. \"Anna I know you can do this just go to your happy place. If it turns bad I'll stay away from you.\" he said. I thought about it and said \"Fine I'll do it, but only to get you away from me.\" \"Whenever you're ready\" he said giving me his mic. I took a deep breath, walked up, the stage and began. The day I first met you You told me you'd never fall in love But now that I get you I know fear is what it really was Now here we are, so close Yet so far, haven't I passed the test? When will you realize Baby, I'm not like the rest Don't wanna break your heart I wanna give your heart a break I know you're scared it's wrong Like you might make a mistake There's just one life to live And there's no time to waste, to waste So let me give your heart a break Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break Oh, yeah yeah On Sunday, you went home alone There were tears in your eyes I called your cell phone, my love But you did not reply The world is ours, if you want it We can take it, if you just take my hand There's no turning back now Baby, try to understand Don't wanna break your heart Wanna give your heart a break I know you're scared it's wrong Like you might make a mistake There's just one life to live And there's no time to waste, to waste So let me give your heart a break Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break There's just so much you can take Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break Oh, yeah yeah When your lips are on my lips And our hearts beat as one But you slip right out of my fingertips Every time you run, whoa Don't wanna break your heart Wanna give your heart a break I know you're scared it's wrong Like you might make a mistake There's just one life to live And there's no time to waste, to waste So let me give your heart a break Cuz you've been hurt before I can see it in your eyes You try to smile it away Some things, you can't disguise Don't wanna break your heart Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache So, let me give your heart a break Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break There's just so much you can take Give your heart a break Let me give your heart a break Your heart a break Oh yeah,yeah The day I first met you You told me you'd never fall in love After that everyone cheered and I felt like I was on top of the world I finally overcame my fear. After the performances everyone was dancing I stayed with Audrey, Tara, Larry and Barry. Then we saw Gavin, Tara gave me and Audrey highfives and Audrey pushed Larry and Barry. I saw Gabe coming up to me, so I went up to him up. \"Hey\" he said. \"Hey, thank you for that performance.\" I said. \"Anna after what you said I'm sorry. I was being a jerk and I should't have done that. Its just I felt embarrassed being with you, but now I don't care about being popular. All I care about is you. Can you forgive me?\" he said. Even though he was acting like a jerk I knew he was better than that and he did help me overcome my fear. I couldn't let go of him. \"I forgive you\" I said. \"By the way I wasn't going to ask you to Morp, I wanted to ask this. Will you be my girlfriend?\" he asked. \"Yes\" I said smiling and he took my hands. \"So that song Give Your Heart a Break is that about me.\" he said. \"So you did listen to that song I gave you.\" I said. \"Yeah I did, but like I asked is it about me\" he said. \"Yeah it is, thanks to you. You inspired me to write that song.\" I said. He leaned into me and gave me a kiss on the lips I kissed him back. We pulled away and smiled at each other. I was happy we were finally together. Then we began to dance with the rest of our friends. Best night ever I got my best friend back, I overcame my fear, and I got a boyfriend. What a night.

I do no own anything Radio Rebel or "},{"Movie":"Radio Rebel","Title":"I Dare You","Author":"raenbc","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7897322","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hey FanFiction! This is basically Radio Rebel rewritten, starting from when Tara had her first segment at SLAM FM. This chapter is dedicated to IluvFabianRutter and Kyle. I do not own Radio Rebel. \"For all I know, Audrey could be recruiting my crush for yoga right now.\" The orange mug nearly slipped from Cami Q's hand as she laughed. \"Back up, Tara. What are the rules of this dare again?\" Tara didn't bother to look around the longue, despite how nervous she was to go into detail. Cami already knew she was shy schoolgirl by day and rockin' radio DJ by night, it wasn't like there was a bigger secret to tell. Tara realized what she felt wasn't fear, it was guilt. She should have been talking about this with her real best friend, the one who came up with the dare. She responded regardless. \"Audrey thinks we should listen to Radio Rebel and not let our differences divide us. She wants us to be ourselves with people we normally wouldn't be ourselves with. People we wouldn't normally even associate with.\" \"Like... Gavin?\" Cami supplied, trying to persuade Tara to rethink a decision she'd already made. She was sure Audrey would understand if Tara wanted him for her partner. He was her crush after all. \"No.\" Tara said softly. (As if she was ever loud.) \"I've... talked to Gavin.\" Cami couldn't help but roll her eyes playfully. \"Only because you have to; you're paired up on a project together.\" \"Yeah,\" Tara agreed. \"so we don't have to be paired up on this dare together too, right?\" She was looking at a strand of auburn hair she twirled around her finger lazily, rather than Cami. Her nervousness was slowly dissolving, though. She was more focused on making up with Audrey after ditching plans with her to do her first show at SLAM. (And not revealing her secret identity to her Best Friend For Totally Like Ever, Without Exception.) Tara saw this dare-a friend related thing-as her second chance. With a sigh, Cami replied: \"I guess not. Well, what are your other options?\" She put her finally-empty mug down and stared directly across the table, giving her full attention. She was determined to get Tara to break out of her shell, and this dare was the perfect way to do so. \"Well, Barry said he's gonna go the extra mile to get Stacy to do this. Which doesn't surprise me. He goes the extra mile with everything, even class participation.\" Cami chuckled, and Tara went on. \"I'm actually really excited to see if he can pull it off.\" She was also glad the queen bee wasn't a choice for her. Stacy already hated both sides of Tara. \"Larry thinks he'd be best off with Kim. He says they can relate because they're both sidekicks. But... I don't agree with that. Barry and Larry are a team. Kim is... she's a lackey.\" \"Sad.\" Cami commented. Tara nodded slightly, while something crossed her mind. Cami watched her brown eyes go wide in realization. \"I must be crazy...\" Tara mumbled. Cami caught that, too. \"Girl, quit telling me about it. Just... go with your gut.\" Tara still looked unsure of whatever she was thinking, which came as no shock. Cami shook her head, but not in pity. She knew this was overwhelming, but that didn't mean something good couldn't come out of it. \"Look, I'm not gonna lie. This dare could... be a total disaster. But you'll never know... 'til you try.\" A smile spread across Tara's face, and she got up from her chair. \"Thanks.\" Cami didn't have time to answer, with how quickly Tara shuffled away. Still, she couldn't help smiling to nobody as the longue door closed. \"No problem.\" Tara kept a mantra on repeat in her head as she ran full speed toward a certain someone's garage. I owe it to Audrey . It helped calm her nerves to have something else in her ears the whole way: the music of You First. This was something she had to do alone, but if she didn't have her mantra and her music, Tara knew she'd be absolutely lost. And this dare would be a lost cause. \"Hi.\" Her greeting was rushed and shaky, since she forced herself to do this. Immediately, the guitar strumming stopped. Tara did her best to hold back a strange gasp-gulp hybrid. With the garage door wide open, the so-called superstar had himself on display. And there was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign in sight. \"Hi.\" Gabe said, not even bothering to look up from the green chair he sat in. He phrased the echo as a question, to voice his confusion. This didn't surprise Tara. She hadn't exactly made a point to be noticed by anyone, let alone a newborn pop. She could bet he had no idea who she was. (Even if the band t-shirt she was wearing made her look like a groupie, it certainly wasn't for the GGGG's. There was really only one G she was interested in.) Gabe was looking aloof as usual, and Tara realized she was unintentionally taking her sweet time explaining why she was standing in the middle of his garage after dark. She spoke up before his aloof-ness turned into annoyance, which she knew wasn't a long shot. \"Listen, Gabe... I know you don't know me and... this is probably gonna sound insane,\" (In the back of her mind, she wondered if it was even audible.) \"but, I wanna... make you a deal.\" She figured she had to make it interesting if she was going to have any chance of going through with this dare. Gabe wasn't catching her drift. \"What kind of deal?\" He had an eyebrow raised, and was barely looking at her. Which Tara figured was for the best. Having two eyes on her made her feel like the world was watching. \"I-If we... hang out... I'll find ways to get the band more exposure.\" Gabe couldn't say 'no' to that, but he didn't see what was in it for her. Not that he really cared, but he asked anyway. \"What are you getting out of this 'friendship'...?\" He used the term very loosely, but the way he let the question hang there suggested he was looking for something. Her name. \"Tara.\" She supplied, still feeling cornered. No word sounded smooth coming from her mouth. \"Tara.\" The way Gabe repeated her name made it sound disposable. Tara tried to ignore that, and contemplated his question quickly. There was really nothing she wanted, other than to make Audrey happy again. She knew there was something she needed, but that made her debate whether or not Gabe was good at keeping his mouth shut. There were really only two things he talked about: the band, and himself. The latter, mostly. \"Well, I could really use a, um, secret-keeper.\" Tara expected Gabe to question what that meant, the way she questioned why she even considered giving away a role that rightfully belonged to her BFFTLEWE. But he only spoke one word. Most likely, it was to get rid of her. Even though Gabe gave the answer Tara was looking for, it didn't exactly make her happy. \"Deal...\" Thanks for reading, please review! I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 2] Here's chapter 2! Dedicated to AmandaSimmons95, INanyCASE, Pink Mockingjay, moveouttathewayitzh, Fallon Skywalker, HideBehindTheMask, DannySamLover20, Coco Gold, wolfshadowstorm, and FaeryGirlsRock. My first reviewers, thank you! I do not own Radio Rebel. \"...despite our differences, we're in this together...\" Tara walked into Lincoln Bay High the next morning to find that couldn't turn around in any direction without nearly bumping into someone wearing red. Radio Rebel made a statement, and it seemed like the whole school was shouting it back to her. But she knew there would be some exceptions (Not everyone was as supportive as her friends, even though they didn't know who they were supporting). Stacy, a definite. Kim probably had to follow her lead, whether she wanted to or not. And even though Gabe had agreed to be Tara's secret-keeper, that didn't mean he had to listen to anything she said under her secret identity. It was a sad thought, but she doubted words other than his own held any value to him. \"Hey.\" She was almost convinced she had telepathy when he came walking up beside her from who-knows-where. He wasn't smiling, but she could bet he'd look worse if he knew what she'd been thinking. Then again, if he didn't take spoken words into account, he probably wouldn't care about the unspoken ones either. Tara wondered if there was any significance behind the frown, or if that was just his usual expression. Gabe was wearing a plain red shirt, so rich in color that it looked brand new. Something caught Tara's eye, making her laugh lightly. \"Hey.\" She echoed. \"A-Are you trying to make two statements at once?\" She stumbled through her question, and could tell by the look on his face that he didn't understand it. \"You're willing to drop labels and you got that shirt on sale?\" Gabe exhaled angrily and looked down, to locate and peel the price sticker from his shirt. He didn't know what to do with it, so he stuck it on the front of Tara's binder. \"That's for you.\" He grumbled, walking off as the bell rang. Tara stood in the middle of the hallway traffic for a few seconds, wondering whether or not she should feel bothered by what had happened. Gabe hadn't made any effort to have a conversation with her, which she didn't mind. It was possible he'd only worn red to ensure Tara would keep up her side of the bargain, and other than keeping her identity secret, he'd do nothing to be part of the dare. Tara stopped herself from mulling over that thought, and giving herself a headache. \"I owe it to Audrey.\" She reminded herself, heading off to class. The four minutes between classes were opportunities as well as travel time. Audrey was famous for always starting something among her small crowd of friends, but it was up to them to carry on with the dare. Larry clasped his hands together, in an attempt to give himself a confidence boost. He was slightly surprised by how much the sound echoed through the library. It caught the attention of a few students, but not the one he was hoping to get to get noticed by. He had to wonder what Kim was doing in the library anyway. It wasn't exactly a place he'd picture a queen bee's right-hand woman. He sauntered over to the table she was seated at and sat down across from her. She didn't notice, too busy clicking away on her phone. She was looking at the screen as if she had a serious issue with it. He decided he was going to wait until she looked up at him, no matter how long it took. (Barry would stick it out, and he had Stacy to deal with.) Larry went to fold his hands up on the table, thinking he'd be waiting awhile, but realized letting his elbows point outward was a mistake when he knocked over a lamp. As he rushed to pick it up, Kim's bulging cyan eyes set on him. Only, half his body was under the table since he didn't want to search for the lamp blindly, so all she saw when she looked up was a red sweatshirt sleeve that covered a flailing arm used for balance. Feeling awkward as ever, she ducked under the table so she could shoot him a look. Then she sat up normally again and waited for him to fetch the lamp. When he set it back up on the table, trying to brush off the thought that he could never do anything right without Barry by his side, she spoke. \"Whoa, you scared me.\" Not exactly what Larry was expecting. He'd been prepared for something along the lines of 'What are you doing here?' He got to thinking that they both were alone, an extreme rarity. Maybe she didn't know how to act without someone guiding her, either. \"Sorry.\" He cut right to the chase. \"We should hang out.\" He knew he had to explain that he was put up to it-although he was going about the dare willingly-or else Kim would find that out the hard way. He wouldn't wish that on anyone, so he said: \"It's this dare, Radio Rebel inspired. Which... probably makes you mad.\" Kim didn't look angry, just puzzled. Larry guessed that she didn't see the point in it all. \"Audrey thought it up. I think it's a great idea. What do ya say?\" Kim blinked. \"Why?\" \"Why?\" \"Yeah, why? I mean, I'm really busy with Stacy's prom queen campaign.\" She said, briefly showing him her phone. \"And I'm sure you have to help your brother find his soul mate, right?\" Larry couldn't help smirking. She actually listened to their conversations. While that did make him happy, not having a dare partner wasn't an option he was willing to take. He had to find a way to reel Kim in, and he was running out of time. \"Yeah.\" He replied, under a sigh. \"But, if-when... Barry manages to get Stacy to be his partner for this dare, he could take over the campaign. And-\" Larry cut himself off. Seeing that Kim was losing interest-still absorbed in her 'work'-he was about ready to give up all together. \"I... really wanna prove that I can do something on my own. For once.\" Kim's eyes darted up at lightning speed. Larry knew he'd struck a nerve. \"I'm in.\" Gavin and Audrey were sitting atop a lunch table back-to-back (her idea), on the lookout for their friends. They all seemed to be buried in whatever it was they had to do, since no one was around. They made small talk while they waited, basically convinced they wouldn't be seeing their friends for the rest of the day. \"Tara said she wished she could talk to everyone the way she talks to me and, I guess, my mind took that and ran with it. I hope it's not inconveniencing you between band stuff, rehearsal and running for prom king.\" Gavin had to chuckle at the last one. \"Not at all. It's kind of amazing.\" The dare was a big risk. One Gavin would have been afraid to take, had Audrey not approached him about it. \"Really? Most people think I tend to over-dramatize.\" If Audrey had a dime for every time she'd been told that, she had no doubt she'd be a billionaire. \"So, you're a dreamer.\" Days ago, the dare could only be a dream. \"There's nothing wrong with that.\" Audrey agreed, but she felt something was wrong. Her stomach wouldn't shut up, even though the two had gotten through eating already. She realized the rumbling sounds were all in her head, but the awkward feeling remained. She was glad she came up with the idea to sit facing away from Gavin, because the look on her face would've raised a lot of questions. Her expression was a mix of euphoria, fury, devastation and horror. \"Nope. Absolutely nothing.\" Barry knew that in order to go the extra mile, he had to take the first step. But every step he'd taken so far had been denied by Stacy. Putting a note in her locker didn't work; she tore it up right in front of his pouty face. Following her around all day only had her convinced he was a stalker, and he'd debunk that theory if she'd let him get a word in. Barry wasn't giving up, even if going the extra mile meant stepping in front of a moving vehicle. The sound of Stacy's breaks screeching to a halt was music to his ears. \"Move!\" She shouted, rather attitudinally. \"Only after you talk to me.\" Barry said, unflinching. \"Fine.\" Stacy replied with a groan. \"Get in. I've got shopping to do, and I'm not letting you delay my plans.\" Barry found that amusing. He wondered what Stacy's friends would think if they saw them together. She wondered what random street corner she was going to drop him off on when whatever he wanted to say got too annoying. \"I've never been in a convertable before.\" He said as he sat down. Stacy sneered, already losing patience. \"What do you want?\" She asked through her teeth, as she drove out of the school parking lot. \"You read the note, you know what I want.\" \"I didn't read it. I was too busy turning it into confetti, remember?\" She asked. Barry's pout made a comeback when she swatted his hand away from the radio buttons he was about to play with. \"Well, if you didn't read it, how could you just refuse it?\" \"Your name was signed at the bottom. Easiest decision of my life.\" Her fiery eyes glanced quickly at his clothing. She was seeing red. If he didn't act fast, Barry knew he'd be left without a dare partner. \"Picture yourself standing on a stage in front all your admiring peers, getting a beautiful crown placed upon your head.\" Stacy would've rolled her eyes at the way he enunciated everything, but she was surprised that the corners of her mouth were turning upward. \"I'd say I appreciate the offer, but I don't. Especially considering Kim's got my prom queen campaign covered.\" \"Actually-\" Barry began. \"Actually?\" Stacy repeated darkly. \"What do you know that I don't?\" \"Kim's partnered up with Larry for this dare. Which means she won't have as much time for you. But I will.\" \"Non-pops are so evil.\" Stacy said in a voice she figured Barry couldn't register, though she was wrong. \"If I agree to this, what do I have to do for you?\" She knew there had to be conditions. There were always conditions. Barry was baffled. He hadn't thought that part through. \"You could... help me find my soul mate.\" \"Just so long as your soul mate isn't Radio... Meddle.\" Since Radio Rebel had been the inspiration for the dare and Stacy felt her life was being messed with, she figured the name fit. \"You're really clever with that.\" Barry complimented. \"Is it?\" She asked, not amused. \"Yeah.\" Barry answered proudly. Stacy rolled her eyes. \"Of course. Everybody loves her.\" \"Jealous are we?\" Barry asked with raised eyebrows. \"I don't care who the object of your affections is.\" She said flatly Barry laughed. \"I meant that as a general statement, but... I'm flattered.\" Stacy's face contorted. \"What?\" Barely looking-since she had to keep her eyes on the road-she tore Barry's red flat cap right off his head and flung it like a Frisbee. It wound up stuck in a tree. \"Good arm, bad temper.\" He told her. \"Nice selling point, terrible catch.\" She retorted. \"I can't believe I almost said 'yes' to this stupid dare.\" \"What if I took out the catch?\" Barry asked. It wasn't a compromise. Even Stacy saw it as unfair, though she didn't admit that. \"Just so we don't have to be alone in this. I mean, Larry's paired with Kim, Tara with Gabe,\" Stacy's jaw dropped a bit at that, but she was barely listening. \"and Audrey with Gavin.\" Stacy would've veered off the road then, if she didn't have more self-control. \"Was anyone gonna run that by me?\" She screamed the question, as if it was more of a demand. \"I just did. You're welcome.\" \"Fine.\" Stacy mumbled. \"I'll do it.\" \"Yay!\" Barry exclaimed, with his fists in the air. Stacy shook her head. \"I am so glad there's no one else on this road.\" She pulled the car over. \"Out.\" He frowned. \"Wait, what if I wanna go shopping, too? I need a new hat.\" Stacy repressed a laugh. \"I guess suffering through one shopping trip with you is our condition then.\" Neither of them smiled as they pulled into another parking lot, wondering what they had gotten themselves into. \"Can we talk?\" Rob looked up from his bowl of fruit-that was probably reserved for pedicure use, though he was too hungry to care-and told Tara: \"Sure.\" Sounding rather surprised. She'd never initiated a conversation between them before. Tara sat down at the kitchen table, across from her step-father. She searched her mind for a place to begin, and then spoke. \"So, there's this guy-\" \"Whoa.\" He couldn't help but interrupt, so caught off guard. \"Okay, bad start.\" Tara decided. She didn't want to give him the wrong idea. \"He's an acquaintance.\" She rephrased after a pause. \"Barely. But, I made him a promise. And I don't like going back on my promises. Even though I already feel like I'm in over my head.\" \"What was this promise?\" Rob felt Tara was being a bit too vague, but he didn't want to pry. \"Basically to increase his band's fanbase. I have some ideas on how to go about it, but I thought... maybe you could help me. But, I don't wanna bother you.\" Rob knew getting any band's name out there was a process, and he could already imagine himself printing posters and making music videos. Whatever he could do to help. \"Nah, it seems like it could be fun.\" Tara give a weak nod, focusing on the table rather than her step-father's face. She felt that was unfair, since he was willing to help her without even knowing the whole deal. (She figured if she mentioned that she told Gabe she was Radio Rebel, then getting Rob's help with the dare would be out of the question.) She looked up at him and said: \"It could... be a bonding thing.\" \"So, what's your favorite shade of blue?\" Stacy parted a rack of dresses down the middle and stared at Barry through it. \"What kind of a question is that?\" She missed the part where she told him he was allowed to talk, but didn't feel like wasting her breath telling him to shut up. She went back to browsing, while he thought of a way to answer. Barry shrugged. \"I don't know. You wear blue a lot.\" He thought it odd, but unique. Most princesses-or wannabe prom queens, in Stacy's case-wore pink as their signature color. Another thing that puzzled him was how she didn't already have a dress for prom picked out. Maybe she had plenty, and was searching for one to add to her collection, to keep her options open. \"You wear hats a lot. What's your favorite type of hat?\" \"I don't play favorites.\" Stacy scoffed. \"Right. You just fantasize about people you'll never be with. People who aren't even real.\" At this point, Barry knew he had two missions during this dare: make Stacy prom queen and figure out why she hated Radio Rebel so much, but still listened to her. \"Why do we keep coming back to the subject of my love interest?\" \"Why are you still here?\" Stacy asked, sounding more annoyed with Barry then usual. \"You're my ride home.\" \"So meet up with me later, you don't have to follow me around.\" \"Right, that's Kim's job.\" Barry knew he'd crossed the line with that comment, especially since Stacy looked about ready to shove the words back down his throat. \"See ya later.\" He choked out, turning on his heel and breaking off into a run. Rolling her eyes, Stacy turned around. She'd lost her focus, nearly forgetting what she was looking for in the first place. Barry's comment may have been uncalled for, but he was right about one thing. She virtually always had a shadow. Now she had no one. Until Barry came back seconds later, looking cautious. She gave him a look. \"What?\" \"You've gotta come see this. I think you'll like it.\" \"If you found it, that's highly doubtful.\" Barry went to put on another pout, and she walked off so she wouldn't have to look at it, without a clue where she was going. He caught up quickly, and went ahead to guide her to the window of another dress shop. \"Do I have a good eye, or what?\" When Stacy answered, she sounded rather distracted, looking straight ahead. (Not that she'd ever given Barry the respect of looking at him directly.) \"No. There's no way I'm taking fashion advice from you.\" \"Then how come you can't stop staring?\" Stacy shook herself out of her dress-induced trance. \"It's a 'no', end of story. Go find your hat.\" \"I should probably give you my number first.\" Barry said casually. She looked at him as if he asked her to give him a kidney. \"So you can call me and tell me where you are when you're done shopping.\" He explained. She reluctantly handed over her cell phone and watched uneasily as Barry typed his number in. \"You know I'm gonna delete it as soon as drop you off home, right?\" He placed the phone gingerly back in her palm as he said: \"The way you constantly remind me you have no interest in me, kinda makes me think you have an interest in me.\" \"Go.\" She replied angrily. With a smirk, Barry wondered off once again. \"I know the dare was my idea, but I don't think... we'll have time for it.\" Gavin looked down at his striped comforter, where he had his phone on speaker. It wasn't very effective, since Audrey couldn't see his expression from her living room. \"We'll make time.\" He insisted, sounding sure of that. \"We could even help each other rehearse, if you want.\" \"No!\" That response came out sounding panicked, unlike Audrey had planned. \"I don't wanna mess with our... individual creativity.\" Gavin laughed. \"Okay, if you think that's best. I don't wanna give up on this, though.\" He was surprised Audrey did. That wasn't like her. He sighed. \"If we back out of this dare, everyone else is bound to follow. And some of us... need this.\" \"Like Tara.\" \"And Gabe.\" \"And Stacy.\" They said in unison, making each other laugh. Audrey sighed silently, submitting. \"Okay. This is gonna be a challenge for me.\" She quickly added: \"And for you, but... we'll make it work. We just have to mind our time.\" Gavin's eyes went wide in realization then. \"Which reminds me,\" He checked the time on his phone. \"I'm late for band practice.\" \"Good luck.\" Audrey said, knowing how Gabe could get. Without thinking, Gavin answered \"You too.\" She giggled before they said their goodbyes. Audrey buried her face in her hands briefly. The sound that came out of her mouth was somewhere between a sigh and a whine. \"Thanks, I'm gonna need it.\" Gavin rushed to get to Gabe's garage, and when he got there, everyone was already set up. \"Is your watch broken?\" Gabe asked, rather than giving him any kind of a greeting. He hadn't meant to come back sounding snarky, but all Gavin could think to say was: \"Glad to see you finally took the price sticker of your shirt.\" (He hadn't mentioned it that morning because Gabe was being grumpy then, too.) Gabe held back a groan of frustration, while the others laughed. Stacy didn't bother calling Barry until she got to her car, to avoid conversation. While she waited around, she debated whether or not to come back another day for the dress he'd found. She decided she'd only do that if the exact same one showed up in some fashion magazine. If so, she'd say that was the reason she got it, not him. She couldn't help but wonder if he found something he wanted. He hadn't mentioned not being done shopping when she called, but he sounded pretty unhappy about something. Stacy's eyes locked on something in the passenger's seat: Barry's wallet. Her first thought was that he was an idiot for leaving a wallet full of money in a convertable with the top down. Her second thought was: How was he supposed to buy anything without any money? She picked the wallet up and opened it to find that it was empty. Which could only mean that Barry hadn't planned on buying anything to begin with. If that was the case, why would he even come along? Stacy put the wallet down in the same place she found it and sat back, just as Barry came into view. When he got in the car, he slipped his wallet back into his pocket silently, thinking she hadn't noticed. Stacy considered asking why he didn't bother her for some cash, but didn't. (Though she figured he was probably too scared to do so.) Something inside told her that the empty wallet was a statement. He wanted her to know that he didn't go to the mall with her so he could shop, but he didn't want to have to say so. Knowing that, Stacy only had one question: Why ? \"I can't remember the last time I spent a day without Stacy. Is that sad?\" Kim asked, looking at her shoes rather than Larry. \"Nah, she's, like, your best friend... right?\" \"Sure.\" Larry wanted to question what she meant by that, but figured it was a touchy subject. The two of them had been walking around aimlessly since the school day ended. Now the only things left on his agenda was to walk Kim home and then tune into Radio Rebel. Even with this dare going on, he was still on a mission to uncover the DJ's true identity. He tried to think of something else to talk about. Questioning what she was wearing seemed stupid. There wasn't a speck of red visible in her entire outfit, but that was most likely Stacy's fault. \"So, you work at a pizza place?\" \"Uh-huh. I'd say you should come visit me when I'm working, but you'd probably just disinfect everything and then get really bored.\" Larry laughed. \"We'll figure this out... I hope.\" \"Ooh, we're here!\" Kim nearly went past her own house, and her outburst sent Larry spiraling toward the ground. \"Are you always this clumsy?\" She asked, debating whether or not to help him to his feet. \"Just lately.\" He said, once he got up again. \"Alright, well, I'll be seeing ya.\" She said, walking toward her door. \"Yep.\" He replied, ready to head home. He turned around and took three steps. \"Hey, Larry?\" Kim called out, making his ears perk up. He was surprised she still had something to say, and turned back around to find her standing right in front of him. \"I have a feeling that, as crazy as this idea is, it'll be good for us.\" Larry couldn't help imagining how Stacy would react if she heard that. He knew she only agreed to the dare because of the promise to be made prom queen. \"Yeah.\" He said with a smile. Kim was about to go back to her house again, but then she thought of something. \"Thanks for choosing me.\" She extended her hand, and after some hesitation, Larry shook it. It wasn't his germaphobe ways that kept him from shaking her hand at first. He faltered because something caught his eye. On the edge of her sleeve, was a little red heart... Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! All ideas are greatly appreciated, I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 3] I'm so happy to (finally) udate! This chapter is dedicated to FaeryGirlsRock, CuttieGirll57, QueenGenie16, wolfshadowstorm, maricafa and Mary-Aly. I do not own Radio Rebel. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" Barry asked as he walked through the hallway at Lincoln Bay, sounding eager to start his first official day of the dare. Stacy didn't look nearly as excited as he did. She didn't like that this dare was her one way to get what she wanted. Or how Barry acted like the dare was the best thing since the invention of prom queen. She'd much rather be with Gavin, and wondered what he was doing at the moment. She hoped Audrey wasn't putting him through the same sort of torture she was going through because of Barry. \" Twelfth Night rehearsal for me and prom queen campaigning for you.\" \"Us.\" Barry corrected, making her look at him as him as if he was speaking another language. \"What?\" \"This is a team effort, it has to be. I'm not the one who wants the crown.\" He said, to show her he wasn't going to let himself be pushed around. \"If you really wanna be prom queen, you have to be just as dedicated to the campaign as I am. Stacy blinked, irritated. \"And how exactly have you shown your dedication to this at all?\" \"I set up your fan page.\" Stacy was slightly impressed, since Kim had never gotten around to doing that. Though she wouldn't give Barry the satisfaction of knowing that. She realized something. \"How'd you manage that? You hardly know me.\" Barry laughed, and replied with: \"I can learn a lot just by observing.\" It took all the strength Stacy had not to pull out her phone and check out the monstrosity she figured his attempt at a fan page must be. For the moment, she decided to just let it go. \"What else are you- we gonna do?\" She asked in a mocking tone that Barry ignored. He shrugged. \"We'll start with the basics. It'll be like a class president campaign, except not as important.\" Stacy narrowed her eyes and gritted her teeth, causing Barry to suppress a startled yelp. \"That was the wrong thing to say again, wasn't it?\" He spoke his thoughts more when he was around Stacy. It was uncontrollable. She answered him with a blunt \"Uh-huh.\" \"Sorry.\" Around the corner, Tara and Audrey were talking by their lockers. \"Where's Gavin?\" Tara asked casually. She was almost glad he wasn't around. She seemed to embarrass herself more every time he was. Audrey talked to him so much easier, since she had no crush to combat when she did. Plus, they had similar interests. Though Gavin left his drama in the classroom. Audrey took some time to answer, and Tara hoped her shyness hadn't rubbed off on her. \"My guess? With the warden.\" The two girls shared a laugh. \"By 'warden' do you mean Stacy or Gabe?\" This only made the girls giggle louder, until a voice cut through the laughter. \" Nice .\" They turned to see Gabe standing behind them. \"Oh, Gabe.\" Tara said, her surprise apparent. \"Oh, Tara.\" He replied, with mock hurt, making Audrey chuckle. Even though it was obvious he wasn't offended, that didn't make Tara feel any better about what she'd said. No one seemed to know what to say next. Audrey was the one to break the very awkward silence. \"Before I forget,\" She said, looking at Tara. \"since this dare is splitting up us BFFTLEWE's,\" Tara nodded, while Gabe raised an eyebrow slightly. \"I think we should set aside a day every week just for the two of us.\" Gabe wondered how long she expected this dare to go on, while Tara automatically answered. \"How 'bout Saturday?\" \"Saturday sounds great.\" Audrey agreed. The best friends shared a smile, and turned back to Gabe. He looked bored. Either that, or he was tired. \"I know I haven't done anything to help the band yet ,\" Tara started slowly, hoping he hadn't gotten fed up already. \"but my step-dad's on board-\" Gabe's eyes lit up a little at those words, even though Tara's sentence fell flat afterward. Rob knew what he was doing when it came to things like making sure a band was marketable. Having him on their side meant the GGGG's were bound to go somewhere. \"We'll make it happen, I promise.\" Gabe didn't look doubtful, but she had no way to tell what he was thinking. Her mind traveled to the worst case scenario, where a broken promise would lead to dead airtime during her segment. Tara stopped herself from following that thought, fully aware that her worry showed in her face. \"Okay.\" Gabe replied, in a way that made it impossible for Tara to tell if he said it to calm her down or get the conversation over with. It really served both purposes, since he left without saying anything else. \"Bye, Gabe.\" Tara said, though he was already out of earshot. Audrey seemed to be the one who was upset by his actions, given how she huffed and rolled her eyes. \"I'll see him later.\" Tara assured her, though she wasn't entirely sure of that herself. \"Are you staking out rehearsal?\" Larry asked jokingly. He walked up beside Kim, who was watching intently from the auditorium doorway. \"Just watching.\" She replied, though there was no explanation needed. \"From this distance?\" She shrugged. \"I don't wanna bother anybody.\" \"Tara and Gavin wouldn't mind, and Stacy probably wouldn't even notice.\" Before Kim even thought of a way to answer that, Larry was off to find himself a seat inside. \"If we're gonna do this, shouldn't we be sneaky?\" She asked as she followed. He seemed more focused on getting there quick-so he wouldn't miss any more of the 'show'-than being stealthy. Even though, in his mind, he was a master at that. They sat all the way in the back. Kim never lost her focus on the scene in front of her. It was compelling, and if she hadn't known it was all an act, she might have believed otherwise. Even Stacy could see something brewing, since she called cut. The whole time Kim had been watching the rehearsal, Larry had his eyes set on her. He just couldn't wrap his head around what she found so fascinating, and his facial expression spoke his curiosity. Though she took no notice, still fixated on Gavin and Tara, as the two took their break. She smiled when they smiled, and Larry could only wonder why. She turned to say something to him-maybe give some insight as to what was going on in her head-but lost her train of thought when she caught his glance. \"What is why you, your brother, and staring?\" She wondered aloud, not sounding the least bit annoyed or creeped out. Larry motioned to the stage rather dramatically, to say that she was the one who'd been staring. \"Touché.\" Kim replied, laughing at her use of the word. Larry lost interest in the rehearsal when Stacy did. He got up and walked out when she stormed off, but Kim trailed behind. She frowned when she saw Tara leave Gavin hanging on a high-five, and frowned more when she saw her take a green CD case. The one that belonged to Gavin. Kim knew what she witnessed was none of her concern, so she just went on her way. Gavin caught up with Audrey at the end of the school day. She was practically running through the hallway, so he had to do the same. \"Hey, Audrey, wait up!\" She stopped short, standing stiff and then turned around. Before she could say anything, the apologetic look on his face got her distracted. She decided to just let him explain himself. \"Remember when you first told me about the dare Monday afternoon?\" Audrey gave a slight nod, not seeing where Gavin was going with this. \"You had to get something out of your locker, so you asked me to hold your water bottle for you, and I dropped it? And it cracked?\" \"And pretty much exploded.\" Audrey answered, under laughs. Her eyes went wide like they were when it happened. With a chuckle, Gavin said: \"Well, in case you were wondering, the reason I seemed to drop off the face of the earth this morning was that I went shopping for a replacement.\" Audrey rolled her eyes playfully. \"You've been hanging out with me too much already. You're starting to talk like me. 'Drop off the face of the earth.'\" She repeated, emphasizing the dramatization. Gavin smiled, though he disagreed. He didn't see why other people saw Audrey as strange. He couldn't see himself ever getting sick of her and her quirks. \"Why would you do that for me?\" Audrey appreciated it, but she felt more guilty than Gavin did breaking the original. It wasn't some grand gesture, but she hated making him go out of his way. Gavin looked at her like the answer was the obvious. \"'Cause that's what friends do.\" He said, pulling the new bottle out of his messenger bag. He slowly turned it around to show her it was personalized. \"Even if they have to go through shelves full of Abbys and Alexs to find an Audrey.\" While she looked at it, surprised but happy, he said: \"Oddly enough, this was the only one.\" He didn't know any other Audreys, so he figured if the store carried water bottles with her name on them, there would be plenty to choose from. To Gavin, that was symbolic. She was one of a kind. He handed the water bottle over, and Audrey accepted it with a smile. \"Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" Gavin answered. With that, Audrey went to leave again. \"Wait a minute.\" Maybe it was all in his head, but he felt like she was blowing him off. Audrey turned back around. \"I know you hate to start something and not finish it. Do you have any ideas on how to kick this dare off officially?\" He found it funny that they had the most common ground, and still didn't know where to start. \"Not yet,\" She told him. \"but I'll think of something and get back to you... tomorrow.\" Gavin gave a reluctant nod and Audrey walked away. He thought about how he'd almost turned down the dare, not only because of timing. He'd figured he and Audrey hung out enough as it was. He was wrong, because if that was the case, he would at least be able to guess what was bothering her lately. All Gavin was sure of was that it had to be something. That afternoon, Rob was sitting in the kitchen trying to map out all the possibilities for getting the GGGG's on the map, when his wife scurried into the room. She was squealing with delight and had her newly manicured nails on display in front of her beaming smile. She fanned her face rapidly, as if she might hyperventilate from all the jumping around she was doing. It took Rob awhile to figure out what all the excitement was about. \"Delilah, that's just Gabe.\" He explained, sort of sorry he had to. He didn't like spoiling her celebration. \"Oh.\" Delilah said, trying to hide her disappointment while she regained her composure. She didn't do a very good job of that, sounding almost angry when she spoke next. \"Well, who's 'Just Gabe' and why am I just now seeing him?\" \"He and Tara weren't friends before.\" Rob didn't know if he could even call them friends. Tara hadn't. \"That's a good reason.\" Delilah joked. They shared a laugh and she started reading over her husband's shoulder. \"What you got there?\" Upstairs, Tara held her own list closer, rather than relinquishing it to Gabe. He sighed heavily from where he sat at the edge of her bed. She sat at her desk chair, looking nervous but focused. She didn't want him to break her concentration. He didn't want to go into their plan blindly. \"Please let me see it.\" He said, suppressing a groan of annoyance. He didn't like having to ask for anything. Especially when it was band-related. \"What if it's not good enough?\" She was thankful Rob was drawing up a list as well, or else getting the GGGG's more exposure might be impossible. Aside from the secret she was sitting on. \"I'll tweak it.\" Gabe reasoned, making her eye him strangely. (Though he didn't notice.) Did that response imply that he thought her list would need tweaking? She didn't know whether to be impressed or offended by his honesty. Meanwhile, Rob and Delilah were having the same sort of discussion. \"Do you really think my plan's gonna need adjustments?\" He asked, sounding a lot more confident about his list than Tara did about hers. \"Just a few.\" Delilah insisted, trying to take the paper Rob playfully kept out of her reach. \"Like what?\" By the way she looked at him, he could tell what his wife had in mind. \"If I end up directing a music video for these guys there's no way Tara can play the lead girl.\" \"Why not?\" Delilah asked, hiding a whine. \"From what she's told me, none of their songs are about relationships,\" Rob explained, watching her face drop. \"and the second Tara sees a camera... she'll faint.\" Delilah laughed lightly. \" Okay .\" Tara submitted as well, handing her paper over to Gabe. He read through it quickly, barely batting an eyelash at anything, which was unnerving for her. When he was done, he only asked one question. \"Why exactly is this list labeled ' Phase Two' ?\" He echoed the title mockingly, then asked: \"What's Phase One?\" Tara smiled. \"You'll see.\" \"Wow.\" Kim gushed as she looked around the pizzeria. It was so spotless it practically sparkled, and she could see her face in the table she sat at with Larry. \"My boss is gonna wanna adopt you.\" Larry laughed. \"Thanks. Just doin' my job.\" \"But you don't even work here.\" \"I meant for the dare.\" \"Pretend I was joking.\" She told him, clearly embarrassed. He forced a laugh that didn't do much help. Kim decided to just change the subject, instead of linger on her moment of confusion. \"So, are you and Barry gonna stakeout SLAM later?\" Larry chuckled at the reference to earlier that day. \"Of course.\" \"Why?\" Kim asked. Coming from her, the question never failed to stump him. He tried to answer anyway. \"I guess I wanna know who she is as bad as he does.\" Lately, Larry had been debating that. There was so much more to do because of the dare, that he'd lost a hold on the mission. It was no longer the center of his life. \"Well, what does it matter?\" Kim asked innocently. \"Would you love her any less if you found out?\" \"Huh.\" Caught off guard, that's all he could say. He'd never looked at the situation like that. \"It could make us famous.\" He explained, once the awe wore off. Kim pondered that, and responded with: \"Couldn't you make you famous?\" The bell attached to the door rang as it opened, interrupting the conversation. The boss was back-which meant break time was over for Kim-and by the look on his face, Larry was already famous in his book. At least, that's how Kim saw it. Considering what he asked her. \"I was only gone ten minutes, what happened?\" Using an equally happy tone, Kim pointed to Larry. \"He happened.\" Gavin's phone rang that night, and he was feeling so flustered he could barely remember what button to push to pick it up. When he did, he had no chance to even give a greeting. Audrey was talking, in a much happier tone than she was that afternoon. \"You were on the RADIO !\" He barely knew how to answer, and just went with: \"I know, I heard.\" He was still stunned. \"I am so happy for you. Do you know what this means, Gavin? You're one step closer to SUPERSTARDOM!\" He had to laugh. \"Thank you.\" He said gratefully, rather than telling her superstardom wasn't what he was after. \"I'm glad you called. I was wondering... is anything wrong?\" The other line was silent for a second. \"What do you mean? The GGGG's are officially out there, on Seattle's hottest radio show no less, and I feel like I'm on top of the world!\" \"I meant... with you.\" Gavin clarified, knowing Audrey was trying to avoid the subject by changing it. \"That sounded like an insult, sorry. Just... is everything okay with you?\" His concern had her concerned, but she didn't let that show. \"It's better than okay.\" \"You sure?\" \"Positive. I even came up with a few ideas.\" She didn't have to specify what for. \"I tell you about all it tomorrow. For now, just keep enjoying your glory.\" \"Whatever you say.\" Gavin replied under a laugh. He smiled as they said their goodbyes, but Audrey figured she didn't have to fake a smile he couldn't see. She was tired of that annoying new habit, so she walked over to her bedroom mirror. She was prepared to give herself a pep talk, and get her real smile back. \"You're overthinking things, that's all. Stop stressing. Tomorrow's a brand new day.\" The following morning, Tara was getting books out of her locker before class. The hand she opened her locker door with was resting on it, with the palm facing out. Someone took that as the opportunity to steal a high-five. \"Props.\" \"Props?\" She repeated, though it was unclear whether she didn't understand why that was said or she felt she didn't deserve it. \"For phase one.\" Gabe explained, a hint of a smile flashing on his face. (He didn't mention how he was so excited to hear himself on the radio that his legs gave out. He happened to be out in public at the time, and it gave all the people around him a good laugh to see him fall over.) Tara smiled back, but didn't get a chance to respond. \"So, is that a thing with us?\" \"Uh...\" She began, clearly lost. \"You say something, I repeat it back to you.\" Gabe said, clearing things up for her. \"Or vice/versa, with the necessary variations.\" He gave himself a look, regarding how overcomplicated he made that sound. Though Tara understood, thinking back. \"I guess so.\" He didn't seem to notice how she brushed the idea off-despite liking it somewhat-and he went back to their original topic. \"How'd you pull that off?\" He had the urge to add 'without my help' to the end of that, but decided not tp. \"It wasn't anything special.\" Tara told him, though she smiled like it was. \"Gavin just happened to drop one of your demos.\" Gabe gave a curt nod in reply, and Tara realized she'd made Gavin sound irresponsible. Since Gabe was still ecstatic yet dumbfounded over the GGGG's getting radio play, he mentally shrugged that off. Another awkward silence fell. After a few seconds, Gabe broke it with: \"See ya.\" \"See ya.\" Tara echoed, not knowing what else to say. \"Our goodbyes too?\" He joked. He was already walking away before she had time to laugh. When lunchtime rolled around, Tara was back by her BFFTLEWE's side. \"So, have you decided what you're gonna do to move forward with the dare yet?\" Audrey shrugged. \"Since Gavin's so busy right now, I'll think I'll mostly just... shadow him.\" \"Hey, Tara.\" Gavin called out as he came into view. \"Can I talk to you?\" Except for now . Audrey thought. Tara hesitated, as she expected. That was fixed with one helpful push, though Tara couldn't help feeling like the encouragement was a little less than enthusiastic. She would've wondered why if she could think straight. Audrey left Tara and Gavin alone and went to find her own lunch table, which was quickly invaded by the twins. \"Where's Tara?\" Barry asked curiously. \"On a whole different planet.\" Audrey answered. Both boys looked lost. \"With Gavin.\" She could tell they didn't see the connection between her two sentences, but didn't bother elaborating. Larry looked between his brother and his friend. \"Well, at least one aspect of our lives can stay semi-normal.\" Audrey knew he meant that lunchtime would serve for when everyone would catch up on what was going on in their lives, but she couldn't resist laughing. Her life had never been normal, and that's how she liked it. \"I don't know whether to hug you or slap you.\" The three looked up to see Stacy. Barry laughed that off, while the others hoped she wasn't talking to them. \"So, you've seen your fanpage?\" Barry asked. \"Surprisingly, it wasn't a total disaster.\" Larry and Audrey exchanged glances, wondering if Stacy ever gave a real compliment. She swallowed a sigh. \"So, what's next?\" \"You're asking me?\" Barry thought that sounded backwards. Stacy was always the one in charge. \"You made all these promises, and if I don't keep them, it's your fault for making me look bad.\" \"I already told you I'd help you.\" Barry answered, at least acting like he wasn't offended by her attitude. \"All you have to do is say 'please'.\" Audrey and Larry looked at each other again, clearly having just as much fun as Barry with this. Stacy rolled her eyes. First she was forced dance by Radio Rebel's orders-only to remind Gavin that he was her prom date, not Tara's-and now Barry expected her to grovel? It was either that, or end up a crownless queen. \"...Please?\" \"Okay.\" Barry answered, as if hearing that was no big deal either. \"It's simple. First, you target your subjects stomachs.\" Larry pointed to his brother, nodding. He saw exactly where he was coming from. Stacy figured the twins only thought way because they were always hungry, but that's not what she said. \"What do you expect me to do, buy cupcakes?\" The look on Barry's face made him seem disgusted by the idea. \"No, make cupcakes. The extra mile, Stacy, the extra mile.\" \"You want me to go the extra mile for the whole school ?\" \"Those who like cupcakes.\" He answered simply. Stacy bit her lip, blinked back a glare and said: \"Whatever makes me prom queen.\" Then she walked off. Barry sighed silently. This was supposed to be a learning experience. So far, Stacy had learned nothing. Not even his brother saw that he was bothered by that. Larry was preoccupied by the realization that Audrey hadn't even touched her tray. \"You gonna eat that?\" He asked. Misinterpreting the question, she slid the tray his way, said her goodbyes and left. \"Free meal.\" He remarked, sounding unhappy to have it. Barry looked just as worried, wondering how talking about food caused Audrey to lose her appetite. \"What just happened?\" When school let out, Kim ran through the crowded halls, nearly knocking Gabe over in the process. He was stronger than her though, and quick to catch his balance. So it did nothing more than make his stumble a bit. \"Where are you going in such a hurry?\" \"Oh, hey. Sorry.\" She said, completely avoiding the question. \"I'll forgive you when you tell me why you're in such a rush.\" His tone implied that he already knew the answer, but she was too excited to catch on. \"I'm trying to find Stacy. We didn't get a chance to talk in class and I've been looking for her ever since.\" Gabe gave her an odd look. \"Why can't you just call her?\" He asked, blocking her path when he saw she was trying to get around him. \"Lost my phone.\" He laughed a little, but her hurt look cut him off. \"Sorry.\" He said, as if it was automatic. \"What's so important that you need to tell her right now ?\" Kim gave up trying to sneak around him, and asked: \"Did you hear your band on Radio Rebel's show last night?\" Gabe managed to make a scoff sound proud. \"Who didn't ?\" \"Do you know who to thank for that?\" He gave the obvious answer. \"Radio Rebel.\" \"Tara Adams.\" Kim corrected. Gabe looked at her, beyond confused. \"My 'dare partner' Tara Adams?\" \"Your dare partner Tara Adams?\" Kim said in the same tone. He seemed more confused hearing that. \"Don't you and Stacy discuss these things?\" \"I guess not.\" \"Anyway,\" Gabe said, wanting off the subject and out of the conversation. \"you think Tara's to thank for this... why ?\" \"I saw her take your demo CD. I didn't know for sure if that's what it was until I heard 'Turn It All Around' play on Radio Rebel's show, but I put two and two together.\" \"So, you think Tara gave the demo to her step-dad and he passed it on? 'Cause that's very possible.\" \"Actually, I think Tara took it for herself.\" Kim clarified. \"That's very not possible.\" Gabe replied, cracking himself up. \"I mean, her ? There's no way some shrinking violet like Tara could pull that off.\" \"I could be right.\" Kim said defensively, not seeing what he found so funny. \"What difference does it make if you are?\" He asked, catching her off guard when he looked her straight in the eye. He made her think about what she'd said to Larry, and how going against that would make her seem hypocritical. \"Even I know that you secretly support Radio Rebel. Why would you wanna bring her down?\" Kim sighed. \"Good point. I guess... I didn't see anything.\" She said, putting on a smile. Gave gave one back, mentally congratulating himself on his acting skills. The act was dropped soon after, when Gabe made his way to SLAM, knowing exactly who he was going there for. He hated having to take a bus, but he didn't have much of a choice. To his surprise, he ran into Delilah while he was waiting at the bus stop. She seemed to drop whatever it was she was doing to come talk to him. It made him feel like he was in the middle of a crazy fan encounter, but it was blatantly obvious to him that she was rooting for him for a reason other than the music he made. \"Hi.\" \"Hey.\" He replied, not really knowing what to say. He'd thought Tara was the queen of awkward conversations, but had a feeling this was going to be much worse. \"You're adorable.\" There was the proof. \"Thank you.\" Gabe wondered if Delilah found it fun to try to embarrass him to death, or if she even knew she was doing that. When the bus pulled up, he felt like running for it. He kept his cool, but Delilah couldn't. He didn't blame her. He was having his own moment of victory seeing 'Who Is Radio Rebel?' on the side of the bus. Before getting on, he offered Delilah a congratulatory high-five opportunity she gladly accepted. (If he and Tara weren't at 'hug level' yet, they certainly weren't.) \"Isn't this crazy?\" She asked him, under a fit of happy laughter. Thinking about it, Gabe saw that the whole situation was. The dare, being paired up with Tara, Tara become a celebrity. Delilah treating him like he was a celebrity-for a very weird reason, but it still counted in his eyes-and his band on their way to becoming celebrities as well. All of it. He smiled before boarding the bus, getting in three words before he was on his way. \"The best kind.\" Tara had to go into SLAM through the back way, to avoid getting caught by the Barry and Larry. Once in the studio, she pulled the blinds up, startling Cami into spilling her salad. Which sparked quiet laughter from the corner of the room. Tara turned to see Gabe, who'd apparently gotten there first. She hadn't expected him to be there at all. Before she could say anything about that, Cami came through the door. \"Did you see the posters?\" Hard to miss . Gabe thought, as Tara unknowingly echoed him. She recounted a story about her mom calling her to tell her 'she' was on the bus, and he had to laugh again. He wondered why he hadn't been in Tara's retelling, and if Delilah had even mentioned he was a witness to that in the first place. He decided to quit wearing out his brain over it, since he figured he'd never understand a woman's logic. He listened to Cami call Tara famous and had to wonder why she seemed bothered by the idea. \"No, I'm not. No, Radio Rebel is.\" She scoffed, disgruntled. \"Even Gavin has a thing for her.\" Gabe found himself laughing at that too, but his reaction went unnoticed. \"That's good .\" Cami said. \"We like Gavin, right?\" With this question, Gabe realized that-whether they knew it or not-the girls were talking like they were the only two in the room. \"Yes, we do. An-\" \"Ladies.\" Both of them turned to Gabe, a bit annoyed but also sorry, given what he said next. \"Can we talk about something I might actually be able to give some input on?\" He looked directly at Tara when he added: \"Like how you owe me, big time?\" \"For what?\" Cami asked, angry he was acting that way, unaware that he was joking. Tara didn't know that either. She swallowed the lump in her throat and let Gabe speak. \"Convincing Kim there was absolutely no way you could be Radio Rebel and even if there was, she shouldn't say a word to Stacy about it.\" Tara let that sink in, figuring out she must've gotten caught taking the GGGG's demo. \"Sorry for the slip up.\" She told him. \"And thanks.\" Gabe shrugged it off. \"Be happy. You're famous .\" With a laugh, Tara took a stray piece of lettuce from Cami's hair. \"Baby, you got fan clubs in every school in Seattle. I mean, look at all of the petitions.\" When Cami went to show her the computer screen, she looked back at Gabe. He was standing there, still feeling out of place. \"C'mon, join the huddle.\" He chuckled and walked over, squeezing between the two of them. \"Speaking of dance breaks, I think I sprained something this morning.\" He told Tara. She looked apologetic, like it was her fault he overdid it with expressing himself. \"I hope you still had fun.\" \"I'm here, aren't I?\" She didn't seem to hear him, too amazed by the response her listeners were giving her. He could see the lightbulb going on above Tara's head, and she confirmed his assumption when she said: \"Wait, I have a really good idea...\" Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! All ideas are welcome, but I really need more for the GGGG's rise to fame and Stacy's prom queen campaign. Also, any suggestions for things the 'dare pairs' can do together. Let me know if there's anything from this chapter you want me to elaborate on as well. I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 4] SO happy to (finally) update! I have a lot of dedications for this chapter, but my 'records' got messy, so I hope I didn't leave anyone out. (Let me know). This chapter is dedicated to moveouttathewayitzh, HideBehindTheMask, CuttieGirrl57, AmandaSimmons95 and runningfromtuesday. Plus my two anonymous reviewers, she she and anna. Also my dad, who came up with Larry's nickname. Enjoy! I do not own Radio Rebel. \"The last time I sat in this lounge after a segment, I got the idea to ask you about the dare.\" \"Yeah?\" Gabe asked from where he sat at the table, feeling like that night was so far away. \"Did you think I was gonna turn it down?\" He wasn't sure why he asked that. It was more of a spoken thought. \"Yeah, actually.\" Tara admitted, sounding far away. Like she was wallowing in the memory. That same fear crept back into her voice. \"But I'm glad you didn't... even if it was one of the scariest things I've ever done. Besides being Radio Rebel.\" He thought about that. \"I guess her bravery shined through then, huh? Lucky for me.\" Tara hid a sigh. For once, she wanted someone- anyone -to not be so shocked that she was Radio Rebel. That she was brave. Even she didn't believe it sometimes. \"So, I guess you didn't have to do much acting with Kim.\" She said, trying not to sound as disappointed as she felt. \"Does it really seem that impossible for me to be Radio Rebel?\" Gabe blinked, trying to think of a way to answer. He felt he was being put on a guilt trip, though he was sure that wasn't Tara's intention. \"I think, if I would've known you then, I wouldn't have been so surprised. But I wouldn't have said anything.\" At least when it came to the twins, that was their favorite guessing game and their mission. Tara didn't know that other kids had their own theories about Radio Rebel's true identity. \"So, I guess it wouldn't have mattered.\" She looked at Gabe, stunned by his words. Not because he wouldn't have seen the possibility of Tara being the girl behind Radio Rebel to be far fetched, but because he sounded scared to speak his mind. \"Why wouldn't you have said anything? You're allowed to have your own opinions.\" Tara couldn't help saying that, since it was part of what Radio Rebel stood for. Gabe gave Tara another direct look, and for a moment she thought he was going to spill his guts, but all he said was: \"I know.\" After a pause, Tara said: \"Gavin gave me an idea today.\" She hadn't exactly changed subjects, which is what made her think Gabe wouldn't want to talk. \"What about?\" He prompted, though he didn't sound interested. Tara's arms were folded-but not in an angry way-as she leaned against the window sill. \"Did you ever write a song about... something other than partying?\" \"Nope.\" Gabe said simply. He didn't even have to think about it. \"Did you ever try ?\" A frown threatened to form on Gabe's face. Rather than give a straight answer, he told Tara: \"The thing about party songs is... people don't read into them. Either their catchy and 'danceable' or they aren't. There's not much to judge.\" She caught his glance and held it. Then, she spoke from her heart. \"There's always a fear that comes with pouring your feelings into something.\" He knew she was speaking from personal experience. \"Some people aren't going to like what they hear.\" Stacy was a prime example, in Tara's case. \"Some people are even gonna try anything to shut you up.\" That seemed to be principal Moreno's mindset when it came to Radio Rebel. \"But,\" Tara took an audible breath and finished her thought. \"it all becomes so worth it... when your message reaches somebody.\" Gabe swallowed a laugh. He didn't want Tara to think it was making fun of her for opening up and trying to encourage him to do something different. But he found it ironic. She told him that to inspire him to try and make an impact on the lives of his fans. She didn't have any inkling of the impact she made on him with those words. Or that they made him count himself as her fan. Which is why all he could do was smile. He was speechless. \"Where'd you last leave your phone?\" Larry hadn't had much luck with making progress in the mission that night, so he was helping Kim with her own. \"Stupid question, wasn't it?\" He asked after an awkward pause. \"Not at all.\" She assured him. \"I just wish I had an answer.\" \"Was it on and charged when you lost it?\" She nodded. \"But it might be dead by now.\" Larry pulled his own phone out of his pocket. \"Only one way to know for sure.\" He dialed her number as quick as he could, and they anxiously listened for a ring. It came from her kitchen. \"It's alive!\" He declared, making Kim have a giggle fit. Together, they ran to find the source of the ring. \"And apparently it's in your cabinet?\" He asked, raising his eyebrows. She opened the cabinet happily. \"With the rice cakes.\" \"Of course.\" He should've guessed. \"You really like those, huh?\" \"Love 'em. Kim corrected while she nodded vigorously. \"They're my favorite.\" \"Do you hear the music?\" Kim asked as she hurried through the school hallway the following afternoon. She had her phone to her ear and Stacy tugging at her wrist. \"Yeah, I'm headed outside right now.\" She reported. \"Not fast enough.\" Stacy ridiculed. \"Who are you talking to, anyway?\" \"Larry.\" Kim told her under laughs. Stacy filled a pause with an annoyed grunt. \"No, I was just telling Stacy that I was tal-\" Stacy took the phone from Kim's hand. \"Goodbye, Larry.\" She hung up the phone and handed it back to Kim, who suppressed a whine. Once outside, Stacy couldn't help but complain. (And even if she could, she would.) \"That girl invaded our airwaves. Does she have to ruin my lunch, too?\" Kim didn't have a chance to respond, too busy turning back to check on the twins, who had taken a spill thanks to a certain pushy principal. \"I was totally unprepared for that.\" Larry said calmly, brushing himself off. Kim offered him a helping hand. \"Ew, the ground is so unsanitary.\" She told him teasingly. He rolled his eyes playfully while Barry looked after Moreno, who was quarreling with Cami. Though the DJ wasn't looking for a fight. She'd already won. \"And here I thought Stacy was the Queen of Mean.\" Saying that didn't get a laugh out of his brother or Kim, but it made a thought cross his mind. He walked over to where Stacy was standing and said: \"We need to talk.\" She gave him a stare that was void of every emotion besides boredom. \"Oh, no. Are you breaking up with me?\" If Barry found her joke amusing, he didn't make that clear. Stacy didn't care about that. She spotted Tara across the way and could only hope she didn't get up the courage to join her and the GGGG's. Tara was busy talking with Audrey-trying not to smile too brightly when she commented on the 'brill' impact Radio Rebel was making-when she looked over. Since Stacy made sure to keep Gavin talking, Gabe was the one who noticed. Tara sent him a wave he reciprocated. He motioned for her to come over-a smile pushing through his lips-and she faltered. \"Go on.\" Audrey urged, though her own feet felt like they were encased in cement. She knew well what kept Tara. \"Come with me. You've gotta make plans with Gavin for later, right?\" \"Right.\" Audrey made the walk over there seem more like a march, given the expression in her eyes. Tara couldn't see the look though, since she was following behind. \"There's always a table to sit on.\" Audrey observed, making Gavin chuckle. \"I guess you can blame that new habit of yours on me.\" Stacy was obviously irritated since her conversation had been cut short but she didn't say so. \"What's the plan?\" Gavin asked, knowing Audrey had one in mind. She had pretty much promised that. \"Today, I thought I'd go with you to work.\" He laughed more when he heard that, making both her and Stacy give him an odd look. Audrey's eyes shifted back and forth. \"Why's that funny?\" She asked him curiously. \"Come with me and you'll found out.\" \"So, are you giving up on us already? Did you decide running for prom queen is too much work?\" Stacy turned her head to eye Barry strangely as she opened her front door. She still couldn't believe he was about to step into her house. \"No.\" She replied to his innocent question in a venomous tone. \"Then what happened to the...cupcakes?\" The pause was caused by his reaction to seeing the place. I thought your house looked big from the outside. For some reason, he didn't say that out loud. He didn't want her to know he thought it was such a big deal. \"They... mutated .\" She said as they entered the kitchen. Barry chuckled. \"You sound like my brother.\" Though he knew he could be just as dramatic, if not more. Stacy seemed disgusted by that, giving Barry the same look he gave her cupcakes. Only one batch had been made, and they looked abysmal lying in the garbage, burnt to a crisp. \"You just left them in the oven for way too long , that's all.\" \"Which is why I decided to-\" \"Give up?\" Barry teased. She didn't take too kindly to that. She went on talking as if he hadn't said anything to begin with. \"Drag you over here, so you can-\" He knew where she was going with this, and there was no way he was going to let himself do all the work. He had to interrupt. \"Help you out? Sure.\" He started opening cabinets and drawers, taking out all the ingredients they would need. \"The first thing you have to keep in mind is that the oven is your friend . You don't have to run away from it, you know.\" She gave him a push that was by no means friendly. He laughed, brushing that off. \"That's obviously what you did.\" Stacy narrowed her eyes at Barry. \"Just shut up and bake.\" Gavin sat on his front stoop fighting back the urge to call up his dare partner and demand that she stop avoiding him. He wasn't the type to demand anything, but he couldn't help wanting to after she approached him at lunch for what turned out to be nothing. Sighing inwardly, he rolled the baseball in his hand down the concrete pathway in front of him. (There was no one else around to play catch with him.) He couldn't believe that in the free time he managed to find, that was all he could do. He continued with the monotonous activity, until the ball didn't roll back. He thought it had just lost momentum after getting too far way. He looked up to find Audrey, with a brand new baseball glove in her hand. It hid the beaming smile on her face, but Gavin mirrored the expression anyway. \"Help me break this in.\" She said, sounding like her normal self. Then her expression turned apologetic. \"I would have made it to Sub-O-Rama today, but-\" She was glad Gavin interrupted her, unsure of her explanation. \"Don't worry about it. You're here now, that's what counts.\" Gavin-having just gotten done with his game of catch with Audrey-showed up to band practice with a satisfied smile on his face, but when the band started playing 'We So Fly', his smile faded. His frustration built up, and finally he had to speak his mind. \"Sorry, guys, I was thinking...\" He trailed off as Gabe stopped singing mid-lyric, turning to give him a look. The expression was hard to place, but Gabe's tone didn't leave much to question. \"What are you doing?\" Gavin couldn't help sounding flustered. He wasn't intimidated, but he'd kept quiet so long it was difficult to find the right words when he needed them. \"Sorry, but... I think we can do better than this. You know, actually say something with our music. Something meaningful , relatable... I was h-\" \"Gavin,\" He was prepared for ultimatums to be delivered. Until Gabe finished with: \"I'm workin' on it.\" He blinked. \"What?\" Gavin managed slowly, despite his surprise. \"I'm workin' on it.\" Gabe repeated, using the same calm tone as he did the first time. \"I'll work on some new stuff, you work on some new stuff, and maybe we'll even collaborate. For now can we get back to the task at hand?\" As his smile made a comeback, Gavin answered: \"Absolutely...\" \" This is Radio Rebel. If you don't go to Lincoln Bay High, you missed out on a rockstar day. I've never seen so many people dancing...\" As Radio Rebel neared the end of her segment, she said: \"Wednesday I introduced-or reintroduced-you listeners to a band known as the GGGG's. If you like what you heard, there's more where that came from. Not only is the band in the process of making their first music video, they have some other surprises in store for their fans. The one I can tell you about involves a jam session coming up. Which is just the SLAM family's way of saying... we're putting on a free concert! And the GGGG's will be first to take the stage.\" After putting on a smile her listeners couldn't see, Radio Rebel signed off. \"It's funny,\" Gabe said, making Tara turn his way. \"with this dare changing up my schedule, Gavin only just got a chance to breathe. Now it's like the band's gonna be working overtime.\" She didn't know how to take that statement, considering that-just the other day-the GGGG's had been Gabe's whole world. Was he saying he'd adjusted to 'dare time' and was dreading going back to the way things were? Or was he looking forward to their next project? Tara kept her thoughts to herself, despite how confused they had her. Wasn't the band the reason Gabe agreed to the dare in the first place? She didn't bother asking, figuring his actions would speak for him in the days that followed. She'd have her answers soon enough. \"Beautiful. \" Barry complimented. Briefly dazed, Stacy asked: \"The cupcakes?\" He had taken their freshest batch out of the oven while she went to do a quick outfit change. Being around him for so long nearly made Stacy forget doing things like that was the norm. She came downstairs just in time to see him place the pan on the cooling rack, and look up to see her new clothes. \"Yeah.\" Barry clarified, not even hesitating to add: \"Not that you ever don't look beautiful.\" She failed to see his sincerity. \"Quit sucking up to me and hand me one of those. I deserve it after spending the day with you doing something like this .\" Disgust never left her tone. \"I think we both do.\" Barry replied, not letting her words hurt him. He picked up a bare cupcake and asked: \"Should I frost it first?\" \"Why even ask that? Who eats a cupcake without frosting?\" Barry blinked. \"People who don't like frosting?\" He picked up a frosting-covered plastic spatula and did the job, quickly and neatly. Stacy felt he could've done that without spinning the spatula first, at the risk of getting frosting flung around the the room and making a mess. She couldn't resist saying something about it, but she surprised herself with what came out of her mouth. \"I'm glad you treat that like an art form 'cause I'm all about presentation, but you don't have to treat it like a game, too.\" He shrugged. \"I can't help it. Plus, there's no reason it can't be both.\" When he passed the cupcake over, she mirrored his smile sarcastically. Then she took a moment to eye the dessert food. The excitement in her eyes melted away. She hesitantly went to take a bite, but didn't go through with it. Instead, she picked up a butter knife and cut the cupcake evenly. She handed one half of the cupcake to a baffled Barry. \"Oh, what ? You can't eat a whole cupcake?\" He wondered aloud, despite how he doubted that. He saw the question as a pointless one, and figured he wouldn't get an honest answer. He had no idea what Stacy's reason for splitting the cupcake was, but he had a hunch it had nothing to do with being nice. She said she was big on presentation. Apparently, she put herself under that umbrella, and-by her false logic-she might not fit into her prom dress if she treated herself. With that thought in mind, Barry didn't find his half of the cupcake to be very appetizing. He tried not to give off any negative vibes regardless, as he put another batch in the oven and declared: \"Break time.\" With relish. \"You mean we're not done yet?\" Stacy asked, making no attempt to suppress a whine. \"Soon.\" He assured her, heading upstairs. Angrily, she followed. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Not only had he neglected to ask permission before wandering off, he was bringing food somewhere other than the kitchen. \"Your room.\" He replied casually, as if that happened on a daily basis. He moved too fast for Stacy to object. She walked through her door to find him staring oddly ad the plethora of pillows on her bed. \"For decoration.\" She explained, since he clearly didn't understand the purpose of that. After he politely gobbled up his cupcake, he turned to her with an eager look in his eyes. She had no way to guess what was going through his mind, so she had to ask: \"What, Barry?\" \"Can I use them to build a fort?\" He was expecting ridicule in response, but all Stacy said was: \"Knock yourself out.\" Her tone implied that she hoped that would happen. She began tossing pillows his way lazily-trying to get that over with as fast as she could-when it accidentally turned into a game. Stacy found herself laughing along with Barry, especially when he had to dive for a pillow that flew off course, and his cell phone ended up dropping out of his pocket. It was within Stacy's reach, so she picked it up as it began to vibrate. \"Who's texting me?\" Barry asked, his voice sounding muffled among all the pillows he crowded around himself. Stacy thought there could only be one answer. Though, looking at the screen, she wasn't positive. \"Ditto.\" She reported, her tone reflecting the puzzled look on her face. \"Ah. It's Larry.\" He said, a soft smile spreading across his face. \" Of course it is.\" Stacy said flatly. The name seemed totally random to her-since she didn't catch the meaning-so she found it fitting. She stepped over the pile of pillows in her way and held the phone out to Barry impatiently. He took it from her, sending her a thankful smile when he did, and seconds later he was laughing. \"He's checking up on me. It's like he thinks you re keeping me prisoner.\" She rolled her glaring eyes while Barry typed out a text message and pressed 'send'. \"What'd you say?\" Stacy asked curiously, crossing her arms. She wanted him to say he defended her, but had a hard time believing he would. \"I said 'How's Kim?'\" \"What does that have to do with me?\" The annoyance in her voice wasn't just because Barry hadn't stood up for her. She couldn't wrap her head around why Kim and Larry spent so much time together, when they had nothing to do other than work. (Since Larry accidentally landed himself a job at the pizzeria.) \"Not everything is about you, Stacy.\" The sing-song way Barry said this told her that comment wasn't meant as a lecture. If anything, it meant he didn't like to dwell on the negative. \"Whatever.\" She dismissed. Then her tone got softer. \"Can I ask something about you?\" Even though Barry felt he was far from finished with his conversation with Larry, he gave Stacy all his attention. He had his shock to thank for that. \"Sure. What?\" \"Do you give all your contacts nonsensical names?\" He laughed lightly, but he took the question seriously. \"They make perfect sense to me.\" His tone implied something, but she wasn't sure whatthat was. She shook off her curiosity and said: \"Shouldn't we put the cupcakes in the fridge to make sure they stay fresh for Monday?\" \" Fridge ?\" Barry echoed, as if the idea was absurd. To explain why he thought that, he added: \"If we did that they'd get all dried out. We should freeze them until they're ready to be frosted.\" As he spoke, he left the room-with Stacy reluctantly following-and descended the stairs. Another trademark pout of his surfaced, since he had to leave his half-built fort behind. \"You're gonna show up here Monday morning to frost them with me?\" Even though this was a question, Stacy made it sound more like an order. \"Only if you're nice to me all weekend.\" Barry teased. \"Like I'd want to spend my weekend with you.\" Stacy was going to have to if she wanted to keep up the campaign. That's not what he said to her, though. He cocked his head to the side and looked her square in the eye. \" Still acting uninterested?\" Wide-eyed, she stamped her foot in frustration. \"It's not an act!\" She insisted, in a yell that-considering he covered his ears-Barry found unnecessary. He was surprised she hadn't laughed his question off instead. \"I have a prom date, remember?\" By the way she said this, it was difficult to tell whether she was being defensive or gloating. \"Plus, there's absolutely no way I would even want be your so-called soulmate Radio Weasel , so there's no way you could like me.\" Barry looked offended. \"I like weasels, they're cute. Besides, the way I see it, you have a cover story . And this isn't about me.\" \"Sure it is... since the idea of me liking you came from your imagination.\" Stacy expected an answer full of-what she thought was-false confidence, but instead Barry said: \"Do you smell something burning?\" \"Not again !\" She groaned, running for the oven along with Barry. They got there just in time to salvage the latest batch. He turned off the oven a put the pan on top of the stove. Then they shared a sigh of relief and a laugh. The GGGG's, along with Tara, Rob, Delilah and Cami, were up the next morning at five o'clock. (That had been Gabe's idea-as part of preparation for a celebrity lifestyle-but the activity planned for the day was not.) \"Are you sure this is where you wanna be on your day off?\" Delilah asked Cami. The excitement in her voice made it obvious that she for one did not want to be anywhere else. Cami just smiled. \"I love stuff like this.\" She also felt obligated to be there for Tara. If she hadn't given the younger DJ a little push, the group may not have been doing this at all. At first, Rob had suggested buying the boys all new clothes before everyone set out to find the perfect spot for their photoshoot. Tara didn't agree on that. (Though it took encouragement from, Cami, her mom, Gavin and Gabe to get her to say so.) She thought the band should dress the way they would on any given day, because that was real. (Delilah was only a smidgen disappointed that she didn't get to be Gabe's stylist for a day.) Once the group decided on a location, Rob set up the professional grade cameras some of his photographer friends had taught him to use. Cami served as a distraction, because a few fans who recognized her voice and/or knew her face stayed out of the frame while she signed autographs for them. She was a roadblock for a moment. The shot-of all four boys standing in the middle of Pike Place Market, with Gabe closest to the camera-was all set up. Rob was ready to take it, when Tara spoke up again. \"Uh... I don't think this is gonna work.\" \"You don't dig it?\" He whispered, since anything Radio Rebel related-even her lingo-had become an inside joke between them, Delilah, and Gabe. The way he asked made it sound as if he thought she was unsatisfied with his work. \"No, it looks totally cool.\" She rushed to reply. \"It's just... you know how people say a picture is worth a thousand words?\" Rob gave an understanding nod, curious to find out what his step-daughter thought the picture said. \"Right now, the only message I'm getting is... Gabe is a conceited snob.\" After a gasp, Delilah mumbled: \"Impossible...\" Tara's eyes went wide when she saw that Gabe overhead, but-aside from a forced cough-he gave no reaction. She quickly rephrased herself. \"Not that I actually think that anymore.\" She said the last word without realizing it, but no one else seemed to pick up on that. \"I just don't understand why he's not standing with everyone else.\" \"Well, he's the frontman.\" Rob explained. \"That's why he's in the front.\" She looked unsure, regardless of his point. He knew how see saw the situation. They were a band. They were a family. They were all equally important. \"You know what? You're right. Guys, move up so your in line with Gabe.\" They did as they were told while Tara smiled. When Rob went to take the picture, he didn't tell the boys to 'say cheese'. He simply asked: \"Can you taste the fame?\" And let the smiles form on their own. Gavin used Tara as his focal point, so he didn't have to force his smile. \"Posing feels so unnatural.\" Gabe said this with perplexity. Photoshoots were something he'd dreamt about. Not for the glamour factor-because he knew he didn't need one to make him look good-but simply because that was a part of being famous. Having that dream fulfilled, he thought he'd feel more accomplished. He thought he'd be happier. While his bandmates agreed, Tara wasn't even listening. She stood off to the side. Looking at her phone and feeling guilty. Rob was the first one to catch her glance. \"What's up?\" \"I promised Audrey I'd spend today with her.\" \"Don't worry. It's only nine o'clock. She might not even be awake yet. Besides, I think we're all in agreement about you not being in this music video-\" Cami and Delilah counted an in sync \"Aw\" as a bonding moment. They both wanted to see her shine, but it it was obvious Tara didn't see this as her spotlight. \"Wait, why not?\" Gavin interjected, automatically. He turned to Tara. \"Tara, you're a great actress.\" Gabe couldn't help scoffing. And once again, there was pride behind the sound. Pride in her. \"I'll say.\" Gavin looked between his other bandmates, and then Gabe, while Tara's eyes widened so much it was painful. She was glad no one noticed. \"You've seen her act?\" \"Yeah, I help her rehearse.\" Gabe replied, without any hesitation. He was completely straight-faced, and Tara wondered how he pulled that off. She knew she had to give the guys a answer before she got roped into acting for the music video. She couldn't let that happen when she had a prior commitment. So she said something that made her heart flop. \"Hey, Gavin. Why don't you call Stacy and see if she wants to be in the video?\" She'd be a be a better fit anyway. She's got the look. Her uneasiness didn't go unnoticed by anyone, but most of the band figured that was just her nature. \"Alright, if you think that's best.\" Gavin took out his phone and dialed Stacy up. \"Hey, Gavin.\" He knew her well enough to tell that she just got through yelling. Which meant she was either angry the phone woke her up, or she had been up already and was yelling at whoever was the reason behind that. \"Sorry to bother you-\" \"Oh, trust me,\" She interrupted. \"you're not the one who's being a bother.\" She told him, talking through her teeth, \"I never thought I'd say this, but you're lucky to be partnered up with Audrey.\" \"Yeah,\" Gavin said. Sometimes he didn't feel that way, but that's not how Stacy heard his answer. Her eyes narrowed, thanks to her jealousy. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"Mostly she avoids me.\" He said, before he even realized his mouth was moving. This calmed Stacy down, but Gavin remember Tara was standing right behind him. She would know who he was referring to, and he hated to make Audrey look bad. He had to rephrase himself. \"But not lately. I guess she was busy before, which is perfectly understandable.\" He could relate. \"Anyway, I called to ask for your help with something.\" When he said that, he tried to make it sound as if she wouldn't have to work. \"I'd love to, but unfortunately I made the mistake of letting someone else write my schedule for today.\" \"Barry's got your plate full?\" \"That's an understatement.\" Stacy sighed. \"Even though I'd rather be anyone but here right now-\" She cut herself off. \"Why don't you just ask Audrey?\" The edgy attitude she used around people outside of her circle crept into her voice then. \"Maybe you can guilt her into it.\" Gavin didn't reply for a minute. That wasn't the way he did things, and Stacy barely gave him a chance to explain himself. He was sure she'd change her mind and cancel her plans with Barry if she knew the reason he'd called, but he had to wonder. With the way Stacy was acting, did she even deserve to know? \"I won't need to. I'm sure Audrey will be happy to help.\" Tara got her best friend on the phone. \"Hey!\" She answered excitedly, eyes bright. \"What's the plan for today?\" \"There's been a slight change.\" Tara said nervously, pacing in a circle. She was unaware of her audience. The way Cami saw it, Tara's parents and the GGGG's were holding their breath. Audrey might be their last resort. \"What kind of change?\" Audrey asked, sitting up abruptly. \"Can you still hang out?\" \"Yeah,\" Tara replied quickly, not wanting to disappoint her again. \"but, what would you say if I asked you to be in a music video?\" Audrey didn't hesitate to answer, smiling to herself . \"I'd say: 'Name the place, I'll be there as soon as I can...'\" Thanks for reading, please review!

Sorry if I missed anyone. Enjoy! I do not own Radio Rebel 8:00 A.M. \"Hey there, Mr. Director.\" Audrey greeted Rob when she showed up to work on the music video. Despite expecting to go through hair and makeup before shooting began, she looked her best, even in her everyday clothes. He chuckled. \"There's our star. How you doin'?\" He probably would've shaken her hand or hugged her, if his hands weren't full. With a clipboard and megaphone, he really looked the part. \" Unfathomably nervous.\" She admitted, taking a deep breath to try and calm herself. \"Really?\" Gabe asked, coming up behind her. His tone of voice matched the look on Rob s face. That wasn't something they'd expected to hear coming from Audrey. Rob put the clipboard down on the grass momentarily, to give Audrey an encouraging clap on the shoulder. Something he figured she needed. Then, hearing the film crew call his name, he picked up the clipboard again and jogged off in their direction. The two kids walked through the set-a summer house a friend of Rob's was allowing him to use for the shoot-which seemed void of life at the moment. Everyone had something to do. Which is what surprised Audrey about seeing Gabe, considering he was so dedicated to the band. She thought he wouldn't bring up what she said again, since the inside of the house was so beautiful it silenced them both. Apparently, the silence was' t something Gabe was comfortable with. When they reached the dining room, stepping lightly since the chandelier hanging above the table looked fragile-and expensive-he asked: \"Why?\" Audrey had no trouble answering. Tara had told her how honest Gabe was, and she figured she owed him the same courtesy. \"Because of how much you guys are depending on me. This is the start of your musical career.\" The pressure she was feeling masked the pride in her voice as she went on. \"I don't wanna be the one to put that in danger.\" \"You really think that?\" He asked as he walked on, into the hallway. He didn't want her to see the look on his face, in case she was able to tell what was on his mind. That's weird . For him, it was. He could' t see why she figured the band's success rested on her shoulders. \"That's why I said it.\" She said as she took a seat on the bottom of the steps. He remained standing. Audrey's response was more of a joke, even though she wanted him to take her seriously. Everyone had asked her for help, and she wasn't going to let them down. That showed in her eyes, and suddenly her argument didn't seem so strange. Gabe looked at her. His cryptic expression was enough to make her hands shake more than they already were. Then he spoke. \"Good.\" \" Good ?\" She echoed questioningly, trying not to sound as disgusted as she felt. \"I find that I work better under pressure.\" \"Are you saying that you get nervous, too?\" It took Audrey some time to notice he could be hinting at that. Thinking it over, she realized Gabe had sounded relieved when he said that. Like he was glad someone could relate. Admitting to that wasn't easy for him. \"All the time. Especially when I don't.\" She laughed in spite of herself, until he laughed back. \"Look, I know they don't call you a drama queen for nothing. You're gonna do great. You and Tara.\" \"Tara?\" Audrey repeated, her shock over the-somewhat random-revelation obvious. She thought Gabe must be tired of hearing her say things back to him. Though he was used to that sort of thing. \"You got her to act?\" Her bright eyes dimmed when he replied. The usually proud tone behind Gabe s scoff was lost to disappointment. \" Please . Unfortunately, not even I am that talented. Cami convinced her to collaborate with the crew on story ideas.\" \"So, she's our writer?\" Audrey asked, getting excited all over again. She was already back on her feet, eager to start working. \"Pretty much.\" Gabe said, as he and Audrey walked out of the house the was they came in. He meant for this to sound casual, but it didn't come out that way. Audrey couldn't describe his tone, but she didn't let it get her worried. Since she could tell one thing for sure. He understood what she was going through. \"I'm mad at you.\" \"Are you trying to set a record for the most amount of times you can say that in a day? 'Cause I think you've got it.\" Barry told Stacy, looking through her kitchen cabinets the entire time he spoke. \"I'm waiting for it to sink in.\" Stacy explained condescendingly, as she stood there watching him with her arms crossed. \"I get it.\" He insisted, pulling cans of various vegetables and soups out and placing them on the counter. After thinking for a moment, he retracted his statement. \"Well I don't get it. But I know.\" \"And why do you think that is?\" The way she asked this, it sounded like she expected Barry to find fault in his plan when he answered. Though he felt he'd done nothing wrong. Which is why he replied with: \"Because I'm taking you out of your comfort zone?\" She laughed that off harshly. \"How could any of your little ideas possibly be in anyone's comfort zone? It's like you thought up everything I'd hate to do and decided to use the campaign as a way to humiliate me.\" Barry took the opportunity to look at Stacy when he peered over his shoulder in search of something to put the cans in. \"Did you just call me an evil genius?\" The grin he gave suggested he liked that label. The stern like she sent him in reply warned he better make that smile disappear before she took care of that for him. \"Sorry, sorry.\" He said, realizing he was being full of himself. \"I think you know by now that I'm not like that. And this is no big deal.\" Barry went on, taking a plastic crate from Stacy that she practically shoved in his hands, since she was still miffed. \"It's just charity work, which your fanpage promised you'd do, and I am not gonna make a liar out of you.\" The level of relish in his voice made her raise her eyebrows, but he failed to notice. \"Don't stress. We're starting small.\" He filled up the crate and looked to Stacy for a reaction. She seemed even angrier than before. \"What?\" He asked innocently. She clenched her fists, and he hoped that wasn't because she felt the urge to use them. \" Nothing is ever a big deal with you. Pretty ironic for a guy who claims to always go the extra mile.\" It was her turn to look for a reaction, but found that difficult since he avoided making eye contact. Barry closed the cabinet. \"That's not true.\" He said finally, in a low voice. He turned to her, with the crate in hand, enthusiasm returning to his tone. \"All I'm saying is, this is gonna be a cinch. For now, we'll gather everything we can for the... drives, and then we'll move on from there.\" He let her know that even though he didn't see this as a challenge, that didn't mean he wasn't going to try everything he could to ensure that Stacy got her crown. \"Besides, I know this means a lot to you.\" He looked her in the eye. \"And I know what it's like to worry you might not get something you've wanted for so long.\" A part of Stacy wanted to ask what he meant by that, but she ignored the thought. \"Fine,\" She submitted. \"but did you really have to collect every non-perishable food item I own?\" Barry's response was delayed once again, because Stacy's teasing sounded friendly. It was unreal. \"Would you rather go on another shopping trip with me?\" \"Never again.\" She answered sharply, with a shudder. He interpreted that as another one of her reminders that she didn't like him. His response was uncontrollably sarcastic. \"Keep it up.\" He set the crate by the front door while Stacy glared at his back. Then he looked toward the stairs apprehensively, before turning back to her. \"Before we do anything else, you should know that there are four rules of prom queen campaigning.\" \"That you made up just now?\" She asked him doubtfully, rolling her eyes. Her tone implied that he was already dead tired of playing by Barry's rules. \"That doesn't make them useless.\" He said. \"Whatever. Tell me now, so we can move on faster.\" Before Barry got to know Stacy, the word 'whatever' was carefree. Coming from Stacy s mouth, it was careless. The terse tone she spoke in threatened to make his pout a permanent fixture in her presence. The serious look he sent her gave no implication that he was about to talk in a playful voice. \"Like I said before, this is a team effort.\" The repetition was meant to make her realize she should step up to the plate. Barry wasn't sure if it was working. \"So, from this point on, we make all decisions together, and we don't leave each other hanging.\" He held up his thumb-to keep track of the rules he went over-and waited for a nod of agreement. Unless he blinked, he missed it. \"Next.\" \"To be prom queen, you have to look good. To look good, you have to do good. Hence the charity work. But it doesn't stop there. What we do today is gonna get you noticed by the people who visit your fanpage. What we do at school is gonna get you noticed by your classmates. If you think about it, you could have the whole town talking.\" Two rules down, two to go. Barry could see that Stacy didn t share his opinion, before she even answered. The sarcasm confirmed that. \"What about the whole state of Seattle?\" Barry knew she wasn't done. He didn't try to interrupt, knowing that would be a mistake. Like what she viewed his plan as. \"Why do you wanna make me into some kind of... model citizen?\" He matched her level of frustration when he answered, but only for a second. He quickly realized raising his voice wouldn't make her listen any better. \" Why is that so horrible? If you do nice things for other people, they'll return the favor. You'll have your crown. Everyone wins.\" Barry could tell by the look on her face that Stacy didn't feel like a winner, being forced into this. It was her only option if she wanted to be prom queen. She knew she couldn't do this on her own. He considered that old news. \"Honestly, Stacy. Are you not satisfied unless you're the only one who gets to be happy?\" \"No.\" She said, with such sorrow in her voice and eyes that it had him momentarily stunned. Until he remembered she took drama. The response could solely be a way to get him to shut up, but Barry didn't dare dwell on that. He didn't let it keep him from talking, either. \"Okay.\" He said, easing into a smile. \"Then here are the other rules.\" He had three fingers up, but hesitated with revealing the third rule. He worried about how she would respond to it. \"Don't be afraid to act silly sometimes. It's part of presentation, which I know you care about. And even though it s not what you're used it will get you noticed. People will laugh with you.\" \" No they won't .\" Her tone was so venomous it had him scared. \"They'll laugh at me.\" Contrary to what they both expected, Barry didn't flinch, stumble or stutter when he answered. In fact, he sound more confident. \"A few people might,\" He said with a sure nod. \"but it won t matter. You don't want their votes anyway.\" Stacy bit back a smile and asked: \"What's the fourth rule?\" She sounded bored. \"The most important rule.\" He told her with a smile, holding up a fourth finger. \"Have fun.\" He looked rather uncomfortable with just his pinky down. He raised it and offered Stacy a high five. She denied him that, giving him a look of pity instead. Barry replaced his signature pout with a whine so soft Stacy didn't hear it, and headed upstairs. \"Again, where do you think you re going?\" She called after him. Even though she had a feeling he was headed the same place she didn t want him before. \"What would you need to do in my room, finish your fort?\" She mocked. \"I thought you said we were leaving.\" She climbed the stairs to find him waiting at the top. \"We will. Once we collect old clothes and books.\" \"Oh, no.\" She objected. \"That's not happening.\" At this point, Stacy figured Barry's goal was to donate her whole house to charity. He didn't see a problem with his plan. \"How could you possibly miss old clothes? Do you even ever wear the same thing twice?\" She didn't answer, or wait for him to come up with an argument for why she didn't need so many books. She didn't even bother to bring up the fact that he said they would make all decisions together. She just pushed past him and opened the door. \"Let's get this over with.\" 9:00 A.M. \"Don't you find it ironic that we get along the best out of everyone, but we can hardly ever find anything to do together?\" Kim's curious look told Larry that she didn't agree with that, but she didn't hesitate to say so anyway. Even though she had her mouth half full of some of the breakfast she cooked up. \"I think Gavin and Audrey get along better than us.\" After a few grossed out stammers, Larry managed to ask: \"You couldn t wait until after you swallowed to express that?\" \"Sorry.\" Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. In that moment, she felt like she could melt into the floorboards of the decking. He shrugged it off, knowing she hadn't even been aware of what she was doing. \"Well, Gavin and Audrey knew each other before. So technically, they cheated .\" He said the last word of his sentence as if he had just discovered the toast in his hand was moldy. Kim laughed. Although she wouldn't call it cheating, she saw his point. \"Yeah, they are friends.\" With that, Larry nearly lost his appetite. \"And we aren't ?\" She stayed calm when she answered, but she wasn't sure if that was the best move. Especially since she thought it might make him even more upset. \"No.\" \" NO ?\" Kim matched Larry's distraught tone when she answered, as quickly as she could. \"I-I didn t mean 'no' as in ' no ' , I meant 'no' as in... 'yes'. \" What ?\" \"Of course we're friends,\" She clarified. \"but Gavin and Audrey were friends first.\" Kim knew those two had always had common interests, but she didn't think that necessarily meant they had bonded in any way. \"Even so, I doubt they have breakfast together.\" She wondered which 'dare pairs' had the best connection. (She automatically ruled out Stacy and Barry.) \"Yeah, I doubt that, too.\" Kim picked up a hint of sadness in Larry's tone, but she didn't understand why it was there. He was lost in thought, stuck on the day when Audrey skipped out on eating lunch. Her new habits were as much of a mystery to him as Radio Rebel's true identity. Despite his concern, he stopped himself from pondering that and tried to get the conversation back on track. \"I think our problem is... we're used to having other people decide everything for us.\" Silence fell after that. Kim looked at Larry uneasily. \"But... we can change that, right?\" Her hushed tone didn't seem the least bit hopeful. \"We have to.\" He corrected. He didn't want to know what kind of life they would have if they couldn't make their own choices. With a nod, she looked at him again. She knew he was right. \"So... how do we start?\" \"I don't know.\" He said, making her groan slightly. Larry groaned internally, seeing how much of a challenge this was going to be. \"I can't think of anything I wanna do.\" He explained as he cleared his plate. (He looked over at Kim's to find it drenched in egg yolk. By comparison, his looked like it had been licked clean.) \"What do you wanna do?\" \"Stacy usually spent weekends shopping and doing stuff to make herself look prettier.\" That only seemed natural to Larry, but he didn't see why Kim would bring it up. \"What does that have to do with us?\" \"Well, I know you might not be up for this, but I'm usually so busy helping her, I don't get to see what it's like.\" Larry's stomach twisted into a knot so big that it had him worried he might see his breakfast again. Every thought in his head and emotion in his heart told him to act on that feeling. Which is why he only had his mouth to blame for his response. \"Okay then, let's do it.\" \"Hey, it's been over an hour since filming started.\" Cami told Tara, who was watching the action from as far away as she could get while still having a clear view. \"I know. Is it going good?\" Cami's eyes were filled with the disappointment Tara expected to hear in her voice. \"Why don't you come see for yourself? You came up with the concept. If you wanna see your vision carried out properly, you're gonna have to talk with the crew.\" Tara shook her head. \"They're professionals, they know what they're doing. I don't wanna get in anyone's way.\" \"You are just as important as anyone else in this project.\" Cami said, in the same comforting tone she'd used when they first officially met and when discussing the dare for the first time. She knew she had to say something to give Tara the extra push she needed. \"That confidence you have in the booth? Use it.\" Before finishing, Cami took Tara gingerly by the shoulders, in hopes that her message would really reach her. \"I dare you.\" Tara giggled. There was no way she could argue. \"Okay.\" The friends shared a quick hug and headed to where the others were taking a break from filming. \"You're not the only one who's nervous about this.\" Cami assured her fellow DJ. (She had told Tara that everybody gets nervous, and now she had some perfect examples.) \"Rob says Gavin sneaks off every chance he gets.\" Tara noticed Cami's tendency to mention Gavin, and had a feeling she would try to push them toward each other. She didn't know if that would actually work, and quickly decided it was best not to think about. Instead, she just kept up the conversation. \"How come?\" It was tough for Cami to explain, and she had to search for the words. \"I don't think Gavin likes that the camera is constantly on him. It's overwhelming. He's just a regular guy, and this isn't exactly an everyday thing.\" Tara's voice sounded distant when she replied, which told Cami she was completely unaware that she spoke aloud. \"Gavin's not a regular guy...\" Cami sent Tara a smile like the one she wore and continued talking. \"I hope he's ready for tomorrow, when they ll shoot all the performance scenes. That'll really be his time to shine.\" \"He will.\" Tara said confidently, slipping her hands into the front pockets of her jeans. \"Audrey's nervousness seems to be working for her. So far she's tripped over a chair, dropped an earring down the drain and sneezed in her cereal.\" Tara's face scrunched up a bit, hearing that last one. \"Ew, and they got all that on tape?\" \"Yeah.\" Cami responded, sounding impressed with Audrey's ability to improvise bad luck, and the film crew's ability to capture her work. \"It's really coming together.\" It didn't take people long to notice Cami had returned, with Tara by her side. \"Is that my daughter?\" Delilah called out. \"It's been so long I barely recognize you!\" Tara shook off her guilty feeling with an embarrassed laugh, as Gavin and Gabe welcomed her back with simple smiles. Small in comparison to the one Audrey had on. The three would've surrounded Tara if the crew hadn't done so first. All they could do was watch worriedly-knowing she wasn't used to the attention-and listen to the crew's excited and somewhat stressed chatter. This told the group that it was time to get back to work. \"Are you having fun?\" The chipper tone in Barry's voice only made Stacy glare at him more. \"That has to be a joke.\" She said coldly. Her face hurt from faking a smile so long. Barry knew she would answer that way, but didn't let on to that. She'd been quiet and scarily smiley since they arrived at the nursing home. It cames as a relief to him to hear her talking again. Even if she did complain. \"This isn't gonna make me look good.\" It was obvious to Barry that she didn't want to be there, but he was getting tired of having his ideas criticized. He didn't think that was a good thing to do considering Stacy didn't seem to have any of her own, but that isn't how he responded. \"Of course it will. The second rule of prom queen campaigning.\" He reasoned. \"It seems fake.\" For the second time that day, her tone carried a hint of sorrow. As if she wished that weren't the case. Barry gave a reassuring smile, though it formed partially as a way to prevent him from admitting that he thought whatever led Stacy to be so popular was fake. \"Maybe that's because you haven't really interacted with anyone. To post pictures of you just sitting here would be pointless. You have to show your voters that you learned something today.\" Barry held out his hand to help Stacy to her feet, which only made her stand up faster. To show that she didn t want his help. As he walked, she followed, getting the strange sense that he knew the place. That was confirmed when at least eight different people-staff and residents alike-greeted Barry, and he talked to them as if he'd known them for years. Once the people passed by, Stacy caught up with him and whispered: \"So far, the only thing I've learned today is you're somehow wildly popular with old people. How big is your family?\" He reflected the look she threw him. \"Nobody here's related to me.\" Stacy would've asked for further explanation if the room Barry took her into didn't cause her to lose her train of thought. It was full of tables and chairs, but otherwise empty, as far as she could tell. \"What are we doing here?\" \"Nothing yet.\" Barry replied, taking out his phone. Stacy couldn't help but be nosy, looking over his shoulder as he scrolled through his contacts. (The first she caught was 'Red', and the one after it was 'Theater', which she could only guess represented Tara and Audrey. Though in Stacy's mind she ruled the theater and in Barry's mind nothing made sense.) Since she was distracted, she barely reacted when he said: \"We re gonna be in charge of Bingo in a few minutes. In the meantime, I ll text Tara and see what she s up to.\" Stacy almost laughed seeing 'Red' highlight blue, but couldn't bring herself to do so much as chuckle-good naturedly, anyway-at anything concerning Her Royal Shyness. Instead, she scoffed. \"Nothing I d be interested in...\" Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW!

I do not own Radio Rebel 10:00 AM \"Give the cage a spin.\" Barry's words were meant to be encouraging, but they fell flat. Stacy herself didn't move, much less turn the crank. She just stood there, wearing an uncomfortable smile that seemed to be stuck. He was glad his friends at the nursing home didn't look like they were running out of patience, but he wanted to move along with the Bingo game anyway. (He figured Stacy would want to rush through it, since she didn't even want to be there.) \"Trust me. Larry's been here as many times as I have. That thing is no stranger to disinfectant.\" The group in front of them laughed, but Stacy wasn't so amused. She didn't seem to be worried about catching the flu or anything like that either. She just didn't see Bingo as a two person job. But Barry wasn't after a crown. And he wasn't going to help her get hers if she put no effort into the campaign. So she took her turn, rather lazily. The machine barely went around once. She went for the ball to call the space, not expecting Barry to do the same. The consequence of that-of course-was that their hands touched. She growled, thinking he'd done that on purpose, despite his look of surprise. He mouthed 'Sorry' as he pulled back his hand and let her call the space. The letter and number might as well have been the annoyed words she chose not to bark at Barry. He swallowed a laugh and resisted the urge to roll his eyes, unsure of whether he saw that as comical or pitiful. It was like he found the perfect job for her. Or, at least, the perfect excuse for her to yell. \"BINGO!\" Someone shouted from the back, sparking laughter from Barry. \"Wow, you're really good at this game. How did you manage to pull off a win when we only called one space?\" While Stacy made a face over Barry's use of the word 'we', the resident replied: \"I was just making sure you were paying attention.\" Others nodded in agreement. Some even spoke up about it. \"That can be a challenge when you're standing next to such a pretty girl, Barry.\" Even though he had already told Stacy she was beautiful himself, he wasn't sure how to respond to that. He figured he wouldn't be able to hear himself think over the conversation that started up between the residents. \" Stacy might be the one to lose her focus.\" One woman said, as her way of stating her opinion on Barry's looks. His eyes quickly found the floor, and his cheeks matched the color of his hair in that moment. He seemed flattered yet embarrassed by the words. As opposed to his Bingo calling partner, who looked outright disgusted over what she heard. Though she didn't sound it. \"I never lose my focus. I'm a professional.\" Tired of the conversation, she gave the cage another spin. The residents looked among themselves, as they seemed to catch a collective chill from her cold tone of voice. Barry sent them an apologetic look. Stacy called the second space, and was almost immediately answered by another excited shout of \"BINGO!\" Everyone except her chuckled. \"Do they do this every time?\" She asked Barry, making no point to whisper. She wanted the others to see how annoyed she was. \"No, this is new.\" He told her happily. He took his turn with the cage and called the third space. All the kids heard was the shuffling of Bingo cards and chips. Stacy decided that calling out a false win when she called the spaces was the players' sick form of entertainment. She let Barry call the next one, hoping they were over their little game. Stacy called the space after that. \"BINGO!\" She answered that with a groan. \"Wait, you're serious?\" Barry asked. She doubted he could tell. Even if he did know everyone in the room by name, how could he be that good at reading them? \"Of course I am, I want my fifty cents.\" Came the reply. Barry went and checked the card, awestruck by the quick win. \"What are the odds of that?\" He smiled, but Stacy didn't see what was so special about it. \"Must be the lucky hat.\" The man told him, smiling back. Some of the others chimed in, asking if Barry had any more hats. This had Stacy wondering if the hat at the center of the discussion was a gift. And why would it be? She stood there with her head in her hand, trying to figure that out. More to the point, trying to figure Barry out. Though she stopped after a few short seconds, seeing no point in doing so. It was a waste of time that could be spent doing more to ensure her getting crowned prom queen. 10:03 AM Larry and Kim's elbows bumped again, causing them to giggle like they had each time before. \"Just let me take care of it.\" He insisted, as he motioned for the plate she was scrubbing. She kept it out of his reach. \"My dishes, my responsibility.\" He gave a small shrug, and went back to doing his half of the work. (The process had probably taken so long because they split the workload, getting side-tracked by conversations all the while, but they didn't mind.) The two of them stood there with sudsy sponges, sharing the space in front of the sink. Kim had given up her rubber gloves, figuring it'd be nigh impossible for Larry to stand touching dishes with his hands. They left the dish drain full with their dripping plates, forks, knives and cups. (And of course, the frying pan.) Then they made their way to the car. She let him drive, and he was happy to since he felt like he'd done nothing productive all day, aside from helping with the dishes. (She was the one who made breakfast.) The two had only been moving along the road for a few moments before something crossed his mind. \"Where exactly are we going?\" \"Either the mall or the spa.\" Kim answered. \"Spa?\" He echoed. Though it didn't sound like a question to her. It sounded like a suggestion. \"Really, you'd rather go there first? I'm surprised you wanna go there at all.\" \"I don't actually.\" He said, only feeling bad about it once he saw the look on Kim's face. A quiet disappointment she tried not to get noticed at all. Larry quickly added to his sentence, in hopes of making it a better one. \"I don't actually... see the point in that.\" He stammered. So much for wishful thinking . \"Well, it's relaxing.\" She reasoned weakly. Larry kept quiet, but his expression argued that 'relaxing' was a relative term. \"Not for you, I guess.\" Kim realized he would either be bored there with nothing to do, or lost and a little uneasy if he participated in whatever it was she had in mind. \"Mall it is.\" She decided. He smiled. Not only did he know where he was going, he knew what to do when he got there. \"You're a really good driver.\" She told him rather randomly. \"Thanks.\" From there, the conversation fell into a silence neither of them were used to. It wasn't the least bit comfortable, but for some reason they did nothing to break it. Kim kept her eyes on the landscape, even though she felt his focus on her at every stoplight. If she would've looked back, she would've seen that he was brooding. Or, as close to brooding as a guy like Larry could get. When the mall was in sight, he snapped himself out of it. He put on a smile, hoping that it was contagious. (Which, he realized, was probably the first time he hoped anything was contagious.) Either that, or that the shopping trip proved to be fulfilling in some sort of way for Kim. All the negative feelings Larry felt toward this idea were canceled out by what seemed to be the only positive one. No matter what happened after they walked into that mall, he wanted to see her honestly happy. 12:00 PM \"I think I'm gonna need some of your relaxation techniques to get through this.\" Gavin admitted to Audrey in between takes of one of the band's last shots of the acting portion of the video. To her relief, she found herself laughing. \"Are you nervous?\" Gavin wondered if that was the right word. He hadn't flinched at the sight of the cameras, but he seemed to have a talent for avoiding them. He saw that as a positive thing, though he was the reason most of the shots needed to be redone. At times, the band seemed to be missing a member. \"I was.\" Audrey confessed as she went on, filling in the silence. Gavin hadn't realized he'd left silence to fill until then. Though he felt guilty for that, as if he were ignoring his dare partner. He also hadn't realized his dare partner was the type to get nervous. \"Really, you ?\" She almost laughed again, seeing that his reaction reflected Gabe's and hers regarding people who were unexpectedly uneasy. \"I forgot how nervous I felt when the cameras started rolling. I forgot there were cameras. And now that I think about it, that's always been easy for me,\" (Even though getting the jitters out was difficult at the start of the project. Since this one meant so much to her, the band, their fans and Tara.) \"becoming my character... this was easiest transition so far.\" She said, smiling pridefully. \"A GGGG's fan? I don't have to act for that.\" He mirrored her smile, but couldn't find words until she said her next sentence. \"Gabe gets nervous too.\" This time Gavin was the one laughing. Not because he was making fun of Gabe, but because that was so difficult to imagine. He could barely picture Audrey as an anxious person, much less Gabe. \"He said so?\" That could simply be an observation of Audrey's part-and as a drama queen she was usually an expert at reading expression-but Gavin had never heard that from his bandmate. He saw that act as proof. Had he ever thought to ask if Gabe got nervous, he'd no doubt get a 'yes' in response. Gabe was an honest guy. Soon after Gabe was brought up in their conversation, he appeared in their line of sight. A smile lingered on his face, over his love for being in front of the camera, they guessed. For a moment, he seemed to be leading the others over to them. Though he just happened to be walking in front. Most of the crew turned, headed for their cars. Gavin tried to process the sight. \"Have we wrapped up already?\" While he sounded confused, Audrey seemed downright appalled. \"Why would they leave without saying goodbye?\" When he reached the 'dare pair', Gabe assured: \"They're not.\" Rob jogged over to the three of them, and as if to back Gabe up, added: \"I called in a favor with someone at Lincoln Bay. We're headed there to film a couple classroom and hallway scenes.\" Gavin smiled at Audrey. \"It's once again your time to shine.\" She mirrored the smile, but her voice sounded curious rather than thankful when she spoke next. In unison with Gabe. \"Where's Tara?\" Rather than looking at Rob when he answered, Audrey looked at Gavin to see if his eyes lit up at the mention of Tara's name. But what she saw was that his eyes scanned their whole set, as if he was looking for Tara himself. \"She's finding a handheld camera to take on the ride there. She thought an interesting way to get behind-the-scenes footage would be from different people's perspectives.\" The others agreed that that was a good idea, but had turned their attention to the way the group had divided themselves for the trip over to school: by gender. Each person moved hurriedly. Gabe chuckled, amused. \"What, are we having a race?\" This caused Audrey to swallow her laughter, finding it odd that Gabe had spoken her thought. \"Actually, yeah.\" Gavin, Audrey and Gabe turned to find Tara behind a camera. \"C'mon Audrey.\" She softly urged. The girls went off toward Cami and Delilah, who were eagerly waving them over to the car they would share. Gavin made his way over to the rest of the band and the crew, but Rob noticed that Gabe hung back a second. He didn't think that was because he wanted to give the girls a head start. \"What's up?\" Gabe looked at Rob and voiced his thought. \"Do you have another camera?\" In the girls' car, Tara's cell phone went off. She fumbled to get it out of her pocket. That was a challenge sitting down. As was text messaging while filming, she found. Especially once the car was in motion. \"Audrey, can you answer this?\" She asked, sounding sorry she had to. Audrey saw no need for feeling sorry. She was happy to do so. \"Sure.\" She scrolled back through the conversation, to get herself caught up with it. She knew her best friend well enough to answer in a way she would, but decided not to. As she typed her reply, she let Barry know she had taken over the job of texting him for awhile. \"Wow, you've both had busy days today. \" She commented, seeing that Barry had already been to the nursing home and soup kitchen. Tara nodded. \"Let's just be glad Stacy doesn't care enough to ask what we've been doing with ours.\" Sad as that sounded, Tara counted it as a good thing. \"She'd flip out on Barry if she knew.\" \" Big time .\" Audrey agreed, watching her best friend turn to look out the window. She knew that wasn't done just for a shot of the scenery. Tara was hoping Barry's texting wouldn't get Stacy curious enough to ask what it was about. He didn't deserve to be treated the way she treated people when she was in a good mood, much less a bad one. 12:17 PM \"It's not fair.\" The words were more a whisper than a yell, but Stacy talking through gritted teeth always seemed to give what she had to say more of an impact. Barry wasn't bothered though. He agreed. Though he wasn't on her exact wavelength. \"Yeah. Why get mad at me over a chance you passed up?\" He looked at her from the passenger's seat of her convertible but, of course, she couldn't meet his glance. He wasn't sure she would even if she could. She could feel his eyes on her, and shook off the thought that the look they carried made her choke out her reply. She tried to speak with as strong a voice as (almost) always. \"I'm not mad at you ,\" In the same fraction of a second, Barry went from being happy to hear that Stacy could admit her mistakes, to realizing the turn her sentence would take. \"I'm mad at Gavin for not being specific enough.\" \"You shouldn't be.\" Barry answered. \"It's not like you gave him a chance.\" With that, he could tell there was a dirty look she wanted to throw him, but she didn't take her eyes off the road. \"I'm not saying sorry for that one.\" He was tired of his own constant apologies. He wondered if he'd only said them in the first place to appease her. \"Besides, doing the music video would be the wrong angle for you.\" \"Why?\" Stacy asked. She sounded as if she was honestly curious, something he didn't know she could be when it came to him until just minutes ago. \"It's vain. For you, it's too much about looking good.\" \"How is that not being good? He asked for my help.\" \"And you turned him down because you already had a plan to help yourself.\" \"Were you even listening to our conversation?\" Stacy asked, matching his tone of frustration. \"I said I'd love to help, but made the mistake of letting you plan my day.\" She huffed over that, since the day didn't feel anywhere near done. And she was headed to the library, where Barry volunteered her to read to children. \"Schedules are just made to keep time. They can be rewritten.\" He pointed out. Stacy wished she would've know that sooner, but what he said next had her feeling worse. Oddly enough, Barry was criticizing himself. \"This one should've been. It was my first.\" He admitted. \"Schedules are more of a Larry thing.\" Despite how many times Stacy heard Barry disappointed, this was different. This was directed at himself. At a red light, she glanced over at him. He didn't notice, too busy adjusting his hat. Putting it back into place. She imagined that it bothered Larry when it wasn't as perfect as possible. And Barry fixed it subconsciously, even though his brother wasn't around to appreciate the effort. For some reason, Stacy's thoughts traveled back to the nursing home, and the man with the lucky hat. She found herself fighting the urge to ask for his story, even though she felt she should be building up the courage to ask for Barry's. For once, she thought, she wasn't the reason he was upset. 12:25 PM \"I think I have a new outfit for every day of the week.\" Kim announced happily as she and Larry walked out of the third clothing store they'd hit that day . She carried her own bags, despite the fact that he offered. \"How come I didn't get to see any of them?\" He asked as they sat down on a bench. He didn't sound annoyed, but he hoped he kept how squeamish he felt well hidden under his curiosity. \"The surprise would be ruined.\" Before Larry had a chance to laugh for not thinking of that himself, she asked: \"Why don't you buy something new?\" He shrugged that off. \"I was here less than a month ago, I don't need any more new stuff.\" Kim shook her head, since he wasn't catching her drift. \"No, I mean completely new. Really... coordinated.\" She seemed to search for a word that would sell him on shopping for something outside his usual style, but all she succeeded in doing was insulting him. Larry looked at his mismatched clothes, then back at Kim. \"I'm fine with what I've got.\" He insisted. But his tone was hushed. She opened her mouth to say something-to try and repair the damage she could see in his eyes-but he spoke before she could. \"I would clean up, but I don't want you fainting.\" Her jaw dropped a bit, but she didn't know how to respond. She'd never heard Larry talk that way. After he laughed, she found out why. \"That's something Barry would say.\" With a giggle, Kim said: \"He thinks he's hot stuff?\" Larry didn't get a chance to answer, when something caught Kim's eye. He wondered when it got so difficult for them to talk. He followed her gaze, to a makeup counter. \"You shouldn't try to be like her.\" He said, surprising himself. Despite the look Kim was giving him, he finished his thought. \"Stacy probably shops so much because she thinks she has to. Like it's expected. Or worse.\" \"What's worse than that?\" Kim questioned, as her eyes moved from the makeup counter back to Larry. \"She's trying to fill a hole.\" At those words, both their stomachs turned. \"Is that what you're doing? Since she's not here?\" \"No.\" At first Kim's voice was borderline venomous. Then she sounded sad and confused. \"You said you were okay with this.\" Both tones made him feel like he could cry. \"I tried to be.\" After some hesitation, Larry rephrased. \"I pretended to be.\" \"Well don't . I hate that.\" Kim's voice dropped to a whisper. \"I hate being lied to.\" Words betrayed Larry then, turning into nothing but stammers. Kim ignored that. \"I did this because I thought it would be fun. Not because I was trying to be like Stacy.\" \"Okay,\" Larry said, locking eyes with her. \"but you don't have to change yourself.\" For the first words he could manage in a while, they didn't do much help. They made Kim more upset. \"I changed my clothes ! That's it. I'm not looking to become a whole new person, I just wanted something a little different.\" Her tone softened. \"That's the reason I agreed to be your dare partner.\" He nodded, thankful for that. Then, he explained himself, figuring he owed her that. \"I thought you might've done this out of jealousy... or just because you missed her.\" \"I do miss her.\" Kim admitted, in a distant sounding voice. Jealousy had nothing to do with it. \"She's the one that changed. And I feel like there's only one good thing that came out of that.\" Larry was almost afraid to ask what, but he did anyway. Since keeping quiet felt like lying, and he didn't want to do that again. \"Which is?\" \"I learned that I should never change. Not if I'm unhappy when I do.\" 1:27 PM A nostalgic smile spread across Stacy face when she stepped inside the children's wing of the library. But Barry had no way to tell what the smile was about, so he took a guess. \"Happy this is our last stop of the day?\" That almost didn't seem possible, and it caused her to echo the words. \"This is our last stop of the day?\" He nodded. \"Unless you want to go out to lunch.\" \"I'll pass.\" She answered rather bitterly, making his smirk vanish. \"Your loss.\" Barry said, even though it was obvious her harshness bothered him. \"Actually, I'd call that a gain. Since I'd be gaining more free time-\" \"To do something that actually matters?\" He questioned mockingly. The impact of his words was enough to make her head jerk back slightly in surprise. \"Predictable.\" He informed her. \"And I know your time with me holds some value, because I'm helping you with this campaign. You should put all the effort that goes into trying to make me feel bad into trying for this crown.\" \"You have a point.\" She admitted, finding a seat in the corner of the room. He followed suit, but sat on the rug beside her. Barry looked up at Stacy. \"I think that's the weirdest thing you've ever said to me.\" He thought aloud, smiling faintly. He found it odd because it was nice. \"Will you let me finish?\" \"Go ahead.\" He said with a wave of his hand, eager to hear the rest. \"We only spend time together because you're helping me. It's not like either of us enjoy it.\" Barry had a chance to respond before the children and some of their parents flooded the room. He just chose not to speak in that moment. \"BARRY!\" Four of the children tackled him to the ground in attempt to hug him. Mostly because he let them, but he hadn't been braced for the impact. While he beamed at them, they were shushed by their parents. \"I told you he'd be here.\" One whispered to the others. \"He's always here.\" A second pointed out. \"I think he lives here.\" A third said. With a laugh, Barry pointed to his left with his thumb. \"Guys, this is Stacy.\" \"Hi, Stacy.\" They chorused. Happy to have been spared from being glomped they way Barry had, she gave them a half-hearted wave. The kids turned their attention back to Barry. \"Is Stacy your girlfriend?\" The first asked softly. Though the whisper was pointless, since Stacy was directly in earshot. And her ears seemed to be burning from the level of embarrassment she felt. Barry didn't sound embarrassed when he answered. He didn't sound panicked, annoyed, saddened, angry or like he found that assumption funny. And in contrast to what Stacy expected, he didn't tell them she wished she was. Instead, he replied with a simple: \"No.\" The kids didn't have time for more questions, even though they could think of plenty. Because it was storytime. 3:00 PM The acting portion of the music video was almost wrapped up. Tara had a last-minute inspiration, and it surprised her how quickly she built up the nerve to mention it. \"Hey, Cami?\" Her fellow DJ looked to her with a smile. \"Yeah?\" Tara motioned for Cami to follow her outside the classroom everyone was standing in. (Which just so happened to be the room where Tara and Gavin's classes met for drama.) The two DJ's exited, causing the others to exchange curious glances. Except Rob and the crew members, who were clued into what Tara had planned. Cami, of course, looked most curious out of everyone. \"What's up?\" \"How would you feel about being in this music video?\" Tara tried to ask that with confidence, because she knew she wouldn't get a 'yes' in answer otherwise. Simple as the question was, it sideswiped Cami. She felt as if she'd been shoved up against the wall she was casually leaning on. Confusion flooded her eyes. Tara stood in front of the opposite wall, patiently awaiting a response. The response she got was a question. \"Aren't we almost wrapped up?\" \" Almost .\" Tara stressed. \"Tara, I'm sorry. I'm a DJ, not an actress.\" With that, the flicker of excitement Tara had felt was almost snuffed out. Almost . Rather than get discouraged and accept that her latest plan would not pan out, Tara walked so that she was standing next to Cami. Her voice dropped to a whisper, but there was nothing shy about it. \"As a DJ, I have to act nearly every day. I act like I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind. Sure, having people not know who I really am makes it easier. But what sold me on sticking to this, was something I heard while try to hide behind a fridge.\" Tara's eyes basically danced in reaction to the awkwardness of that statement. Cami's eyes shined, and her mouth dropped slightly in surprise. She slowly smiled. \"The reason I want you in this music video, is you gave me the courage to do something that scared me. You knew how happy being Radio Rebel makes me.\" Tara looked back at the classroom, sensing that the people inside were growing anxious. \"Now, this isn't much of a big break, but I hope it makes you happy.\" After a moment, Cami decided: \"Okay, I'll give it a shot.\" She was beginning to see the true significance of her appearance in the video as the two walked back into the classroom. Tara didn't have to tell her outright. As the crew instructed Cami, Tara watched from the back of the room. She was glad to have both her best friends involved in a project she came up with the concept for. Cami felt a camera on her that wasn't operated by one of the crew. She turned to see Gabe filming her, and grinned slightly. She felt like he was preparing her for her role. Up until he asked what was on his mind. In the way that only he could. For a completely harmless question, it got under her skin. \"So, what's the deal with you and stripes?\" The look she meant to send him went unseen as she reevaluated her outfit. She hadn't realized it, but it indeed included a striped pattern. (It was much more dressy than her usual attire though, which is part of the reason Tara got the idea to have her in the video.) It was what she was comfortable wearing. In a way, it was what made her comfortable with herself. Or, it had. Until Gabe regarded it as something strange. Cami mentally shook it off. She had an obligation to Tara, and didn't need to waste time trying to explain something that was just natural for her. \"I like stripes.\" She said, straight to the camera. She figured Gabe would probe for the reason why. He didn't. \"Alright then.\" Cami wasn't sure if he smiled at her before he hurried out of the shot, standing between Gavin and Tara on the back wall. The crew set everything up, and Rob made one last little speech while the actresses took their places. \"Alright everyone, this is our last shot of day one. By this time tomorrow the video should be in editing. Think we can do this in one take?\" Cami shook her head, making her curls scatter just slightly. \"Not likely. I'm new at this, people.\" The group chuckled, but they laughed even more when Gabe made another observation. \"This class has really poor attendance.\" (No extras would be used for the sequence, since it focused completely on Audrey's character and her teacher.) \"Maybe that's the reason I'm failing you.\" Cami joked, holding up the test paper prop with an 'F' written on top. Audrey took a look at it mid-laugh. It was an extra one found lying around, that she'd lazily filled out the first page of before the shot was set up. \"I actually aced that when it was given.\" The others cheered, causing giggle fits around the room once again. When the laughter died down, 'Action' was called for the last time that day. Unlike what Cami thought, the scene was done in one take. The crew packed up, and everyone headed for home. As the group walked through Lincoln Bay's front doors, offering words of congratulations and thanks, Cami asked Tara: \"How was it?\" Tara was sort of stumped by the question. \"Just your scene, or the whole experience?\" \"Everything.\" Cami clarified, watching Tara turn to her. She wore the brightest smile Cami had ever seen on her when she spoke next, using words that had left a great impression on her. \"All kinds of amazing.\" Barry was glad to be done with schedules. He figured Stacy was just glad she didn't have to see him for a few more hours. When she dropped him off at his house and he told her to rest up for tomorrow, she gave him an odd look and drove away without saying goodbye. He flashed a sardonic smile in her direction and went inside. He walked into the kitchen to find Larry taking the first bite of a rice cake. \"Really?\" It was a strange sight to be greeted with any day. \"They're good.\" His twin insisted with a shrug. Barry took a bite for himself, not bothering to break off a piece first. \"No argument there.\" As he handed the rice cake back to his brother, he noticed the disgusted look on his face. \"It's not like I took a bite from the same side, relax.\" Larry just shuddered, debating whether or not to keep eating or let Barry have the rest of the 'contaminated' rice cake. He took the third option and just put it back on the paper plate on the counter he was standing in front of. Then he spoke. \"How was your day?\" The question came out uneasily, because it was something they never had to ask each other. This was the first time they were seeing each other since they got up that morning. \"Good.\" \"Really?\" Larry asked, in the same manner his brother had used seeing him with his new favorite snack. \"Stacy complained a lot less than usual. Sometimes she was even nice.\" Larry looked dumbfounded. Then something crossed his mind. \"Did you take a nap on the way home? Because that sounds like a dream.\" Barry found that question ridiculous. \"Like Stacy would let me sleep in her car and run the risk of drooling.\" \"Ew.\" Larry whined at the very mention of that possibility. Barry laughed silently. \"How was your day?\" To his shock, Larry glanced down at his shoes. \"Kim thinks I have no sense of style and that I over-analyze things.\" Barry didn't speak for a moment. He didn't know what to say. \"Stacy thinks I don't like hanging out with her.\" \"That makes sense. Since you don't.\" That was basically true, but Barry wished it wasn't. For some reason, he could only chuckle in response. Larry didn't find it funny. \"Stacy insults you on a daily basis. Just because she decided to put up with you today, doesn't mean things are gonna be different.\" Barry didn't hear anger in his brother's tone. He actually sounded disappointed, like that should've been obvious. \"Stacy insulting you? That's normal. That's just how she talks. When Kim does that, even accidentally... it hurts.\" Barry looked empathetic, because despite how expected Stacy's insults were, they still packed a punch. \"But I'm lucky. Kim's my friend. Stacy's your responsibility.\" \"Stacy's her own responsibility.\" Barry argued. Although he didn't sound like he was looking for a fight. \"If I didn't like helping her, I wouldn't still be doing this.\" Determination had never been something that brought the brothers down. Their refusal to give up made it seem as if this conversation could have no end, so they both silently decided to let it go. Larry tried to split the rice cake, which resulted in two piles of crumbly pieces. He put his own pile on one plate and gave Barry the other one. This was their truce. Barry couldn't help but be reminded of when he split a cupcake to share with Stacy. He wondered what she was up to in that moment. The queen bee was debating whether or not to call her prom date and give him a real apology for missing the music video shoot. And being mean to him. She decided against it, thinking he was doing what she should've been: resting up. She went to take the decorative pillows off her bed, but realized that had been taken care of that morning. Courtesy of Barry. She looked at his unfinished fort and resisted the urge to smile. But she had to admit, she was thankful to have less work to do. Sitting on her bed, she thought she ought to call Kim. They were best friends after all. The phone rang three times before the line opened up. \"Hey.\" Kim greeted, sounding a bit frazzled. \"Hey, what're you doing?\" Kim expected to be told to drop everything and take care of something for Stacy in that instance. \"Taking the tags off some new clothes.\" She admitted lamely. \" Fun .\" Stacy teased, but it was. She wondered what kinds of things Kim bought, and was sure she would find out Monday. She asked anyway. \"You'll see.\" Kim assured her. Then, she got an idea. Even though she had just hung up all her new clothes, she took them all from the closet and surveyed them. Stacy could hear the quiet commotion, and wondered what was going on. \"You're in for a surprise.\" Kim informed her excitedily. \"Is there anything you don't do? Musically, I mean.\" Gabe smiled at Tara from his usual spot in his garage. \"What would people even call you? GGGG's Singer/guitarist/bassist/drummer/pianist?\" \"Sounds good.\" He agreed nonchalantly. \"That's amazing.\" Tara complimented, as she paced the garage and her eyes scanned all the instruments. \"Not really.\" Her eyes fell on him then. \"Not to me. It's like with you.\" \"Me?\" Tara asked, clearly not seeing things the way her dare partner did. \"For Radio Rebel's fans, what you do is amazing and inspirational. For you, it's a job.\" Tara wondered if he had heard anything she said to him in the lounge. True, she didn't see what she did as amazing. But she hoped it was inspirational. \"You don't think you inspire people?\" She had stopped pacing, and her eyes locked on Gabe. \"Not yet.\" That wasn't said as if it was tragic or regrettable. For him, it was a simple fact. As was what Tara told him then. \"You will...\" Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! Anything you want me to elaborate on? I'm definitely going to expand on the man with the lucky hat, and maybe the kids at the library. Let me know if you have any suggestions for names and things like that. Also, let me know if you have any ideas. (And if you spot any spelling errors, let me know. I always go back and edit, but I don't catch everything.) I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 7] Still with me, readers? Sorry for the long wait. I have most of the next chapter in mind already, but I decided to split it 'cause this deserved an update. This chapter is dedicated toDannySamLover20, AmandaSimmons95, demigirl606, . . .Words, tisha b, purplerosefromyou, Dragonfan47, Dandy-ni, MiYuki Kurama, and The Throne. Enjoy! I do not own Radio Rebel Larry's morning routine went uninterrupted by his brother, and that raised concern. Not enough to make him wonder where Barry went so early, though. The events of the dare threw off everyone's schedules. Except Larry's. As he descended the stairs, he knew the only thing waiting at the bottom was the kitchen. (Where he'd serve himself breakfast from 6:30 to 6:45.) At least, he thought he knew. Until his walk was cut short. Kim sat on the bottom step with her back pressed up against the wall and her legs stretched out so that the toes of her socks almost touched the banister. \"Hey!\" She greeted happily, as if she didn't notice the look of pure bewilderment on her dare partner's face. \"Barry let me in before he left. I wasn't sure if you'd mind me wearing shoes in the house so I took them off at the door.\" \"Are you trying out a new method of tripping people, or did you just not want me to miss you?\" Kim's fading smile told Larry that thought should've gone unspoken. (Especially since, as he reflected on it, it didn't make much sense. If she wanted to trip him, she'd have to be subtle about it.) In attempt to spare her feelings, he said: \"You're hard to miss.\" He realized that might sound worse, depending on how she interpreted it, and clarified: \"And by miss I mean 'not notice'.\" She smiled at his attempt to make her feel better, knowing he never meant to make her feel bad. \"I should've just said 'Hey'!\" He matched the enthusiastic tone she'd used, making her laugh. She put one foot down to stop her from falling. Even though it was only a one-step drop. Then she stood up and fixed her shirt by pulling the bottom hem down to where it rested at her hips. \"So, how'd you sleep?\" \"Well, thanks.\" He replied rather casually, considering he hadn't seen that coming. \"How about you?\" \"Great.\" She said in a tone that made him wonder what she dreamt about, not knowing she was musing over something in her reality. \"Great.\" He echoed, glad to hear that. He led her to the kitchen, going into detail about all the food he had to offer. She cut him off, not annoyed. She just didn't want him to waste words. \"I'll have whatever you're having.\" \"Okay, but it's kind of plain.\" She saw the cereal and berries he prepared to put in a bowl with milk-everything organic-and couldn't say she agreed. In fact, she didn't say anything. She got up and tried to follow suit. Larry stopped her, gingerly taking the bowl from her grasp. *\"My dishes, my responsibility.\" He insisted, thinking the guest shouldn't have to lift a finger. \"You didn't let me handle my own dishes.\" She pointed out, taking the bowl back. He let go immediately, not wanting to have to deal with broken glass. Once they prepared their breakfast and sat down to eat, Kim felt the need to apologize. \"I ruined your plans, didn't I?\" Larry's original plan hadn't included her, but he completely forgotten what they were when he got downstairs. \"Right now, keeping this dare going is the only plan. Everything else-except school and work-is up in the air.\" She looked stunned by the comment, and he watched some berries roll off the spoon that handn't made it to her mouth. Which hung open slightly in disbelief. \"Doesn't that bother you?\" \"It drives me bonkers,\" He confirmed. \"but… I could use some spontaneity in my life.\" He was surprised how easily words he never thought he'd speak rolled off his tongue. It was so unlike him to be unfazed by not having everything mapped out. Even unmasking Radio Rebel had a game plan. His surprise did not hold a candle to Kim's shock, but she kept quiet about it. Instead, she just smiled. As weird as it was, she felt accomplished. Then that rush of pride rushed out of her. \"I don't wanna change you.\" Her voice was low and her tone was guilty. She remembered how upset he was when he thought a change in her appearance meant a change in personality. While that wasn't the case, she didn't want a change of plans to mean that for him. \"You're not.\" He assured. So quick and so calm it did little to convince her not to worry. A naturally nervous person didn't usually talk that way. \"It's just… something a little different.\" He used the words she had when defending her new outfit choices. And it worked. \"It'll be fun to venture out of my comfort zone.\" \"And you're not scared?\" She asked accidentally. Sometimes she wondered why she ever opened her mouth around him, since the wrong thing always seemed to slip out. He didn't see it that way, though. Larry couldn't help scoffing. \"I'm terrified. And maybe it's not rational to be terrified. How much trouble could we get into?\" Kim knew that question was rhetorical, so she let him continue. \"Maybe I'm more scared of missing out. I have to accept that there are things I can't plan for.\" Before bringing his empty bowl over to the sink, he sent his dare partner a smile and said: \"I know I'll be happier when I do.\" \"All I could think to say was: 'You will'.\" Tara was being her own worst critic, and venting to Cami in the process. While the house that served as their set was nice, they wished for the coziness of the lounge. They sat together on the steps, getting one last look at the place before they joined the others who would be filming outside. \"I feel like I can only give good advice when I'm in a booth.\" \"That's ridiculous.\" Cami dismissed. \"Especially since you used to make these podcasts from your room.\" They laughed, although Tara didn't feel like laughing. \"Do you think that's why Gabe won't open up to me? Because I can't give him advice like I give to Radio Rebel's listeners?\" Cami shook her head. \"He knows who you are. There's less of a filter when you're with him because you don't have to worry about keeping a secret. You would've said the same sort of things if he'd called into SLAM to talk to you. Gabe might not say it, but I think he's glad to have you to talk to. He's happy to get encouragement from you, even if you think it's no big deal. Opening up is just gonna take time.\" The argument was so hard to agree with. For Tara, there was such a separation. She and Radio Rebel were not the same person. Like so many fans had said, she wished she had that kind of confidence. That level of honesty. Her frown faded before Cami could catch it, because if she did she would know she hadn't helped. The way Tara saw it, her secret identity was more authentic than the one known to everyone. She managed a nod, and got up to walk out of the house. Cami sensed the change in her mood, from-critical to crestfallen-and hurried to give her fellow DJ a hug. \"You know what it's like, juggling a personality. You have to do that every day. It doesn't make you fake if you're not a hundred percent yourself a hundred percent of the time. It just makes you human.\" Tara heard a lot of truth in those words, but it was hard for her to seem like she did when everyone around her was completely in their element. Everyone except Gavin. While the crew and the rest of the band were setting up to perform, he was wondering if he'd even be able to join them. Audrey took notice of how nervous he looked, and decided it was up to her to do something about that. \"You can do this,\" She encouraged as she walked over to him. He had done this. She'd heard the proof. She had to give him a way to put his doubts about that aside. There was a technique that worked well for her, and as she said it she almost hoped it sounded weird. Weird enough to work. \"you are the hyena.\" Instead of an odd expression, Gavin gave her a smile in response. Somehow, he knew what she meant. If he could have control over this situation, that gave him hope that he had control over what it would lead to. He just hoped they were right in their thinking; otherwise he had a right to panic. The doorway that divided Stacy and Barry might as well have been a portal between worlds. She stood there in a state she'd sworn she would never let herself be seen in: wearing loose-fitting pajamas with her hair up in a lazy ponytail. And of course, not a speck of makeup covered her face. He on the other hand was dressed to the nines-in his eyes, at least-in formal clothes that still managed to be fun. Despite how embarrassed she felt been seen before beatification, Stacy greeted him was a dry mutter of: \"You look… colorful.\" Barry figured this was as close to giving areal compliment as she would ever get. \"What are you dressed like that for?\" \"Charity.\" He supplied simply. \"No one dresses like that to do charity work.\" Stacy dismissed, audibly frustrated. \"They do if they're raising money by dancing until they drop.\" He went on with his explanation, talking over the volumes her scowl seemed to speak. \"It was a friend's gig but he and his partner gave up their slot to support the cause .\" Those words sounded mocking, which didn't make sense to Stacy considering this made it seem like Barry was taking the campaign very seriously. \"You called in a favor for me?\" It didn't feel like a favor. It felt like another way of getting under her skin, and she wondered how many extra miles he was willing to go for that. Barry didn't see it that way. As he'd said before, he saw the campaign as something bigger than them. \"I called in a favor for Seattle. So, are you up for it?\" She mulled it over. It would make her look good, and it wasn't like she had nothing to wear. Her closet full of dresses with the tags still attached made that a futile argument. \"Buy me breakfast first?\" Stacy was surprised that came out as a question and not a command. So was Barry, but that couldn't been seen in his smile. \"That was the plan.\" He informed as she turned and went to get ready, leaving the door open for him. She turned when she got to the staircase, pointing a stern finger in her dare partner's direction. \"That doesn't make it a date.\" \"Uh-huh.\" He replied, obviously enjoying the fact that she felt the need to remind him. \"It's not .\" She stressed as she resumed walking. She didn't make it another three steps before he felt the need to reply. \"Sure.\" While the word was meant to be used to accept what she was told him, his tone told her he wasn't going to drop his theory. She ignored his comment and kept walking, barely making it out of sight before Barry spoke again. \"Hey, Stacy?\" He called quietly, as if he just remembered something important. She huffed, thinking he was about to tell her the day's schedule included more than dancing. He looked up at her as if she was very far away, but spoke in a voice so low she was surprised she heard without being right beside him. He said a single word that he'd been holding onto since she answered the door. (He remembered the look on her face, that he only got a glimpse of before her eyes found the ground and she put on the expression he was used to.) It was something she needed to hear, but knowing that didn't make it any less true. \"Beautiful.\" Lost for words, Stacy sent him a look he couldn't discern before continuing on her way. Even though she said nothing back, Barry felt satisfied. That meant what he said was sinking in. \"You're really close to the grass.\" Kim didn't like that she was stating the obvious, but she had to express her concern in some way. Larry couldn't enjoy himself while he constantly worried about losing his balance. Though, he had a lot more skill with rollerblading than he realized. \"It's the lesser of two evils,\" He rationalized. \"If I fall, grass will probably aggravate my eczema. But it won't give me road rash.\" With a giggle, Kim shrugged. \"Whatever works,\" She said as she sped past him on the path in the park. \"but I don't think you're gonna fall. You're doing fine.\" She assured as she turned to face him. This only added to his nervousness, because he couldn't see her trusting him to be her eyes ending well. At the same time, it was impressive. \"How do you do that?\" In response, she just gave another shrug. Then she stopped, waiting for him to catch up. Some sudden spurt of confidence allowed him to veer to the middle of the path to join her. Her beaming smile was a major contrast to the knot forming in his stomach. Being brave wasn't something he saw ending well for him, either. Even if it was one of Radio Rebel's principles. \"Whoa. Where did that come from?\" Kim questioned as they continued along the path together, at a slower and steadier pace. When Larry moved, he hadn't thought about why. At first, it didn't even seem possible. Suddenly, the reason was obvious. \"I just… I wanted to keep up.\" She didn't think that was something new for him. She didn't doubt that he had to create a lot of courage to keep up with his brother. With this thought, she knew leaving Larry's comfort zone wasn't entirely unprecedented. Barry made that easier. And-although she didn't know how-so did Kim. To those around her, it may have looked like Stacy was very focused on chewing, but she was actually gritting her teeth behind her lips. \"We're the youngest people in here.\" She pointed out to Barry, who sat across from her, eating in silence. In what seemed to be one fluid motion, he raised his eyebrows, swallowed and leaned back in the booth, squaring his shoulders. He looked around, but only for a moment. Then he turned his attention back to her. \"We're also the people having the least amount of fun.\" The dinner had drawn a good crowd, of mostly elderly patrons, and the place was alive with happy chatting. \"Senior citizens eat early because they get discounts. We're eating early so we make it to our event on time.\" He had a point, but she didn't want to say so. Plus, a thought got her sidetracked when her eyes landed on his wallet. It was sitting out on the table beside his glass of juice. \"I thought you were broke.\" Barry shook his head. \"If I was, why would I offer to pay for you?\" She didn't answer, her thoughts still wandered. Her eyes settled back on him as she asked: \"So, how much was it?\" His expression told her he wasn't following. For a second, he thought she was asking about breakfast. Which they hadn't finished yet. \"The dress at the mall. The one you… picked out for me.\" Stacy found her phrasing weird. Or maybe it was that fact that Barry had done that that seemed so strange. \"Uh,\" He began, as he chased a potato around with his fork. \"I didn't check, but I doubt anything that makes the window would be on clearance.\" She narrowed her eyes before getting back to eating. Either she didn't find him funny, or found the concept of clearance items to be against the rules of fashion. Most likely both. \"What? You're gonna tell me you never bought anything on clearance?\" Maybe she was just so dedicated to her image she couldn't own up to that. \"I get it. Look good, feel good-\" \"I thought for you it was more like: Do good, look good.\" Stacy interrupted, as if she caught him in a lie. \"Well, it is, but-\" For him it was a combination of both. It was one thing to look good. But acting ugly wouldn't have them looking good for long. And then how could they feel good? She didn't give him the chance to voice his thoughts, interrupting again. \"Do you think you don't look good?\" Her question-and the hint of concern her tone carried-had him so confused he could only comeback with: \"What?\" She knew there was no need to repeat herself. And she knew he was mulling it over. As if boys weren't allowed to get self-conscious about their appearance. \"You look good, Barry.\" ( That was a real compliment. And she figured by his logic, with all the good he did, he ought to have something to show for it.) Barry dropped his fork. It bounced off his plate and landed on the floor, but he didn't even notice. \"What?\" He couldn't help asking again, this time in a much lower voice. Stacy didn't bother rephrasing herself. She meant what she said, in the matter-of-fact way she said it. \"You dropped your fork.\" She told him, repressing a laugh. Ironically, he did laugh, while he went to retrieve the utensil. \"Ya know what that means.\" She nodded, and spoke bluntly. \"You need a clean fork.\" That was true, but it wasn't what he was thinking. \"Company's coming.\" He corrected, earning himself an odd look. Then, sort of absentmindedly, he asked: \"Didn't I have a point I was trying to make?\" \"Probably.\" She said, unable to roll her eyes. \"Something about clearance.\" \"Right, yeah.\" He said, trying to get himself back on track. He pushed his nearly-empty plate in Stacy's direction. She looked at the plate-rather than him-as if she was disgusted. \"It's great that you like to present yourself well, but you don't have to waste all you time and money doing that.\" His opinion didn't seem valid to her, because her only response was: \"Let's get out of here and go dance.\" She sounded impatient, not eager. It took a few drawn out minutes before the check came. When the dare partners left, Barry held the door open for Stacy. She said nothing, as she was used to the treatment. He told her: \"By the way, thanks.\" She looked at him, with eyebrows lowered. Completely missing the point. \"Why are you thanking me? You're the one that paid.\" Behind the cameras, Tara, Cami and Delilah sat having themselves a mini-concert. Except they were sitting on the lawn, listening to the same song on repeat thanks to a backing track. Take after take, where mess-ups were bound to happen. Greg was rocking so hard he accidentally broke a drumstick. Rather than get upset, he laughed at himself and ran to find a replacement. Gavin and Audrey kept bumping into each other. She had helped him channel his inner hyena, but felt like a lemming since she kept following him around. Not that she was trying to, but she was part of the performance and just wanted to stick to the script. She didn't find it funny, but everyone else took it in stride. For whatever reason, Gabe couldn't stop yawning. And yawning seemed extra contagious for the band compared to most people. \"I know I'm not boring myself.\" He said, making the others laugh while he wondered what the problem stemmed from. After a quick water break, the band got back to their places, and Rob rattled off: \"Take 412.\" Sparking even more laughter. It wasn't really, not even close. But the joke cut the tension, and the band worked hard to make sure they didn't reach that number of takes. Not by a long shot. The three watching acted as their loyal fans, but as Audrey had said, they didn't have to do much acting. By the afternoon, Kim and Larry had pick up a shift at the pizza place. Working wasn't exactly fun, but it was something to do. This was something in her comfort zone, boring as it could be. Except that he made it less boring. They made quite a team, turning the pizzeria into a spotless place that offered service with a smile. And although they hadn't given it much thought, work wasn't in the plans for other of them that day. It was something spontaneous. Sure, it was a smile step at that. It hadn't surprised them the way rollerblading did. But it made Kim hopeful that things would change for the better. It was a short workday, and when business started slowing down, she was looking for a way to keep herself entertained. There wasn't much to do besides talk. \"What are Stacy and your brother up to today?\" She asked curiously, leaning on the counter behind her for a bit. Larry swallowed a sigh. \"She really doesn't brief you on this stuff, huh?\" Kim just shook her head. The update hadn't been immediate, but Barry let his brother know what was going on. \"They went dancing.\" He knew how that would sound. Maybe he wanted it to sound that way, so she would have something to be excited about. He figured his last comment brought her mood down. She knew better, though. \"I bet she's not happy about that.\" \"Probably not,\" Larry agreed, seeing there was no convincing her otherwise. \"but I don't think he's all that happy either.\" \"Why not?\" Kim questioned. \"How could anyone not be happy dancing?\" \"I can't speak for everyone, but I don't see how dancing can be fun when your partner hates your guts.\" It was clear in Kim's expression that she got defensive over this, since Stacy wasn't there to take offense herself. She didn't sound angry. She sounded more analytical. Though she didn't go deep when she told him: \"I don't think Stacy hates anyone. It's a long story, okay?\" He would just have to accept that there wouldn't be time to tell that story. Larry didn't want to accept excuses for why Stacy acted the way she did. Especially when he couldn't even wrap his head around it. \"Everyone has problems; I don't see why she has to take hers out on other people.\" Kim wondered how her dare partner defined problems, with his medical afflictions and the trouble he had with social skills. She knew more costumers were bound to walk through the door, so if she dared to ask that question she'd have to save it for later. She knew what she said next wasn't profound, and she wasn't trying to pick sides. \"I don't either.\" She admitted, her smile completely gone from her face. \"I'm tired.\" Stacy complained. Barry expected to hear that, but he expected to hear it hours ago, and a hundred times over. \"Me too.\" He admitted, though he knew that wasn't the answer she was looking for. They had been holding themselves up. She hadn't explicitly stated this, but it was possible she didn't touch him because she thought him disease-ridden. Which was laughable, given who his brother was. \"How long have we been at this?\" She asked as her eyes got heavy. Just as she blinked, she saw him raise his eyebrows at her. \"Can you not see the giant digital clock up there on the wall?\" He pointed, as if she had forgotten where to look. \" No ,\" She informed in a whine. \"I can't. It just looks like big, red, blurry light.\" She didn't even try to see for herself, knowing her tired eyes wouldn't let her see clearly. She just made sure she didn't stop moving. \"You're really dedicated to this.\" Barry marveled. He wasn't sure this was the same Stacy from the morning. \"Don't ask me to explain it. I guess the DJ had a really good set list.\" He didn't comment on how she was trying to play it off as no big deal. He just smiled to himself, seeing she was making progress. \"You're really good at this, too.\" \"Naturally.\" She replied, sounding like her normal self. \"So, what time is it?\" Only then did it occur to Barry that he hadn't taken a look for himself. His sleepy voice sounded casual to start, and then there was audible panic. \"Oh, it's… 11:15 ?!\" Though they subconsciously knew it would get them disqualified, they both froze. Their spotlights cut off as they stared wide-eyed at each other. Without waiting to hear word from the announcers, they bolted out the door. Which was impressive, considering how they were dressed. Stacy was in the lead, but she yelled back to Barry as she ran. \"We are gonna be in so much trouble!\" She doubted the cause counted if they were past curfew. \"Why didn't anybody call me?\" \"They probably did and you just didn't hear over the music.\" Barry reasoned. \"That's comforting.\" She said sarcastically. \"How come no one called you?\" \"They probably did… but I forgot my phone in the car.\" He admitted sheepishly. He expected to get yelled at for this, especially since the phone could've gotten stolen. Stacy did yell. She yelled because her heel got caught on her dress-that reached the ground even when she tried to hold it up-and she took a tumble. \"I broke a heel, not my ankle.\" She said when she heard Barry scream as he came running for her. \"I'm okay.\" He tried to help her up, but her hands were buried in the fabric of her dress. She got herself to her feet and took off her other shoe. Her feet couldn't feel the cold ground through all that material. She knew she was ruining her dress walking that way, but she couldn't care. She realized her outfit choice wasn't in the least bit practical, and that meant it got in the way of doing something else. Driving. Disappointed in herself-but having the darkness to shroud that-she reached into the pocketbook she had slung over her shoulder and pulled out her keys. She handed them to Barry, who felt as confused as he felt useless in that moment. \"You drive.\" It was supposed to be a demand, but it came out so smoothly it sounded nice. \"The speed limit?\" He questioned. It was a joke, but she took it seriously. \"Sure, if you wanna get in even more trouble.\" He narrowed his eyes just slightly. \"I'm a more than sure I'd be in worse trouble if I drove over the speed limit.\" They got in the car, and a thought dawned on Barry. Stacy must've read his mind. \"This is a one-time thing, but you can bring the car back in the morning.\" He nodded and drove off. After another long day, the pizzeria was locked up, the music video was wrapped up and some dancers were still up. But Barry and Stacy were asleep in their beds, as was most of the group. Only Rob stayed awake, hard at work editing behind-the-scenes footage to put up after the music video. Every member on the project seemed to shine, and they each were the focus of someone else. Nobody had used the handheld cameras to film themselves. No one except Gabe. Rob almost skipped this piece of footage altogether. Curiosity won out over his annoyance for the size of Gabe's ego, so he had to review whatever was said. The boy on camera stood in some corner of the set, and spoke in a soft tone even though it was obvious he was alone. \"We put our all in this. Our first major project. And I know it's not gonna be major for everyone,\" He said this as if it was some personal insecurity he was coping with. \"but it doesn't have to be. It's about what the fans get out of it.\" He said his next sentence with an audible smile. And his commentary took a turn Rob hadn't seen coming. It was almost as if the boy was speaking directly to him. \"Giving Tara creative control. That was… a smart decision. She's not gonna call herself a star.\" He said, shaking his head to back that up. \"Especially since she was behind the scenes. But she taught me that this isn't about being a star.\" Rob smiled, proud of his step-daughter, as Gabe finished his speech. \"It's about reaching people. And if we reach people, then we're doing this right...\" Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! (According to The Radio Rebel wikia, The GGGG's drummer's name is Greg. So what about the other guy? I couldn't find anything about him, so lemme know what you guys think.) Let me know if there's anything I should elaborate on, and if there are any spelling/grammar/phrasing mistakes. I'll be rewatching Radio Rebel soon so I can have even more inspiration for next chapter. Ideas are always welcome, I'll update ASAP! =] .[Chapter 8] Happy New Year, my lovely readers! I know it's been a long wait, (UGH, school) but I actually feel production 'cause I still have 3 other docs in the manager. Which means my updates are less spaced out. I wrote this chapter with 4 scenes planned out, so the rest wrote itself. I think it'll be a good buildup to the next one, which will probably span a longer time. (Which, of course, means a longer chapter.) I'm planning on a lot of heart to hearts. This chapter is dedicated to EmmaALewisS, Dandy-ni, puzzlepirateking, demigirl606 and DannySamLover20. Enjoy! \"Watch out for fire hydrants. Oh, and I wouldn't recommended drinking anything on your way there. A spill might be really hard to clean.\" Barry looked at his brother, who was standing at the side of Stacy's car. He'd adjusted the mirrors, and was now giving every piece of advice could think of about how to care for the vehicle. \"Trust me,\" Barry insisted. \"When it comes to this, I'm thinking like you.\" Larry smiled, flattered. \"Thanks.\" He started on his way to his own car. Then he heard Barry call out \"See you at school!\" He smiled and waved as his brother drove away. At Tara's house, Delilah's happy squeals greeted the morning. Only once breakfast was finished with did anyone think to ask what they were about. Though Rob had a clue, grinning knowingly. \"Did you see it yet?\" He asked. \"See what?\" Tara asked, after putting her plate in the sink. \"The music video.\" Delilah filled in, sounding like she was on the verge of exploding. In a good way, of course. \"Our masterpiece.\" Rob said, gesturing to the three of them. \"It's up already?\" Tara asked, earning a nod. \"That was quick.\" Her phone was set down in the middle of the table, so Rob slid it over to her. \"I'll drive you. You can watch on the way.\" \"I expected to see you sitting on the porch. Or maybe the curb.\" Barry admitted as he stood at Stacy's door. (More than that, he was surprised she wasn't giving her car a complete inspection.) She shook her head. \"I had to thaw out cupcakes, remember?\" She held the door open for him and closed it once he was inside the house. \"Yeah, I remember.\" He said as he nodded. \"Did you start frosting without me?\" She gave him a look that didn't match the tone she used. A tone that was perplexingly playful. \"What fun would that be?\" She watched his eyebrows raised and wondered what he'd think once she finished her thought. \"Besides, I can't do it with as much flare.\" \"You have your own flare.\" He reasoned, following her into the kitchen. \"That's the beauty of this whole thing.\" She stared at him for a second, while he hands reached for the things they needed. (Everything was already set out on the counter.) \"That's really how you see it?\" Maybe he was just trying to make himself look good. It sounded like the sort of thing people said because they thought it was what others wanted to hear. She knew by now Barry wasn't like that. \"Everyone's got something to bring to the table.\" He meant in terms of the dare, but she was thinking on a different level. She shook her head, trying not to get sidetracked from her work. \"You wanna meet the world and your brother wants to hide from it.\" \"He's not a coward,\" Barry defended. \"he's just cautious.\" \"Well, how'd he get to be so cautious when you're so confident?\" Barry blinked. \"I don't know. I guess so there's a balance. Is that how it is with you and Kim?\" Stacy accidentally frosted her own thumb. While she looked at it, annoyed, all Barry could think to say was: \"Sweet, second breakfast.\" She scoffed and went to wash her thumb off. \"Aw.\" He said, disappointed. Not only because of the little waste. He figured she'd either forgotten the conversation or wanted to drop it all together. \"Kim gets to have all the fun.\" Stacy answered, giving no explanation for why she thought that. \"Not anymore.\" Barry said with a smile. \"Oh, right.\" She replied, like she only just remembered. \"I have to have fun now. It's a rule.\" His eyes no longer had a split focus, between her and the cupcakes. They were stuck on the counter for a second. \"You're not just having fun because it's a rule, are you?\" After a pause, she admitted. \"No, sometimes it happens by accident.\" Audrey's phone had been flooded with texts within the hour she spent getting ready for school. Every single one was encouraging and congratulatory. She suddenly wondered if she should change her outfit to match her newfound stardom. She had already planned out what she was wearing days before, and there wasn't much time left to change it all up before she had to leave. She felt like she was settling, unlike Kim who was sure of her outfit choice for that day. Even though only one of them had done something that had them looking like overnight sensations that weekend, both girls were about to gain a lot of attention. \"GGGG's for life!\" Fans were shouting the words the went along with Gavin and Gabe's handshake through the halls, having seen their music video. The boys wore beaming smiles. They had to part ways at one point, and Gabe found Tara by her locker. \"Hey, Superstar.\" She greeted, catching him off guard. \"Huh.\" He could say the same to her. Not just because of the little game they played. Not just because of the work she did on the music video, either. Being Radio Rebel was a pretty good gig, too. They saw Audrey coming toward them and couldn't help but offer her the same greeting. \"I can't believe this.\" She said, in the happiest way. \"Someone asked for my autograph!\" \"I'm not surprised.\" Tara told her. \"Hey, guys, look at this.\" Gavin said as he came back into view. He held out his phone. A picture was on the screen, of the band's logo written over and over on construction paper. \"Where was this?\" Tara managed to squeak out. The wall, or whatever was behind it, was completely covered in the design, along with messages written by fans. \"My locker.\" He replied. The group's celebration was almost cut short. \"Hey,\" Stacy called out, heels clicking as she rushed through the hall. There was an understandable edge to her voice, given the opportunity she'd missed. Audrey almost felt like hiding. Until she finished her sentence. \"good job.\" The boys smiled thankfully, while the girls could only exchange glances. They wondered if she was addressing all of them. And how she could effortlessly carry so many cupcakes. The twins came around then. Barry had another container of cupcakes, but some were already missing from his. He handed some out to the others, and asked Larry and his dare partner. \"So, how does it feel to be famous-adjacent?' Stacy chuckled. \"When I'm prom queen, I won't have to settle for famous-adjacent.\" \"Hey, where's Kim?\" Larry asked. He sounded concerned because, up until the dare happened, it was rare not to see her at Stacy's side. Tara was the first to give an answer of any substance. She was arguably the most observant of the bunch, since she didn't typically have as much to say. \"I… think that's her.\" She answered, pointing to a girl the crowd in the hallway parted for. A girl in plaids, stripes, polka dots and mismatched socks. Her shoes were the same because she hadn't purchased any new ones recently. Strange looks were sent her way when she started her walked down the hallway, but soon the expressions softened. People wore smiles that matched hers. Most of Tara's friends wondered why Kim was dressed that way. She wasn't about to judge, given what she stood for, but she still didn't understand it. It was definitely a change of pace from Kim's usual style. In fact, she looked less like herself and more like Larry, who was staring with his mouth slightly open. Until his brother gave him a nudge. \"Well, that's-\" Stacy began, before Barry interrupted. \"Different.\" \"I know,\" Kim said, jutting her chin out in Larry's direction for a second. \"looks better on him.\" Larry laughed in reply. \"I think you might be my competition.\" He countered. \"One trip to the mall and you're a mismatched fashionista.\" He didn't notice his brother smirking beside him. Or Audrey's comment, which was more of an inside joke only Tara knew about. \"You got all that at the mall? It's a good thing you didn't get a haircut.\" \"That wasn't the point of this,\" Stacy said, remembering the phone conversation she had with Kim. \"was it?\" \"No,\" Kim clarified. Then she looked back at Larry, and explained: \"it's my way to say sorry.\" He nodded slowly. \"Message received.\" When Barry nudged him, he continued. \"I forgive you.\" Like before, he didn't notice the impression his words made on the others. Stacy in particular. By lunchtime, Barry handed out all his cupcakes. Stacy only had a few left to give out, but she assumed that most of the kids who accepted them only did so because they didn't want to pass up free food. She'd left the rest in the faculty fridge so they wouldn't lose their freshness. When she was down to her last cupcake, she recognized someone sitting by himself. She wasn't sure of his name, but she remembered him because he took a remote control car to school. And she'd kicked it over in a fit of anger. She walked over and placed the cupcake in front of him, wordlessly. When he gave her a shifty-eyed glance of confusion, she figured she had to explain herself. First, she had to make sure Barry wasn't watching. If she'd done this just to bolster her image, it wouldn't count. \"Consider it a peace offering.\" She told the boy. He smiled and stuttered through a thank you. \"Don't mention it. Really.\" This was her attempt at an apology, not a way to earn more votes. \"I like the blue frosting.\" He told her. \"It's my favorite color.\" She said, wondering why he still hadn't taken a bite. He'd cleaned his tray; so maybe he wasn't hungry. A thought crossed the boy's mind, and though he was almost afraid to voice it in light of recent events, he asked: \"You don't mind if I… regift this, do you?\" She was soft of of offended, but shook her head. \"Not as long as I'm forgiven.\" Despite how honest she sounded, the boy didn't believe her. He barely got to where he was going before he turned around to ask her one last thing. \"You really want this, huh?\" Being prom queen wasn't just a dream. It was a mission. Stacy nodded. \"I wanna earn it, too.\" \"...Best of luck.\" He wished as he went off again. She watched as he placed the cupcake on another table, in front of a girl. Stacy realized she recognized her as well. (A girl who could teach knew thing or two about doing good for goodness sake.) She was the one who left carnations for everyone on Valentine's Day. And she was pleasantly surprised by the treat she was presented with. Stacy found herself smiling. Another happy accident. \"So my listeners at Hoover High were so inspired by what went down at Lincoln Bay, they had a full on flash mob at lunch today….\" Radio Rebel wrapped up her segment, and Tara realized how hungry she was. Especially since Cami sat there, putting away a salad. \"I'm gonna order something from Sub-O-Rama.\" She told Gabe. \"Do you want anything?\" She could tell that didn't sound appetizing to him, but she wasn't sure why. \"I'm craving pizza.\" He told her. \"I don't think they serve pizza at sub shops.\" He had to laugh. He'd never been teased by someone so shy. \"I could go for pizza.\" She decided. The only reason she was settling for subs is because they delivered, and that meant she didn't have to risk being found out by the twins. \"Cool. We could hang out with Kim and Larry. They're working right now.\" Gabe informed. \"Oh, great.\" She said with a smile. That meant she had nothing to worry about. Since he put her mind at ease, she didn't notice the look of suspicion that had entered Cami's eyes. The bell above the pizzeria door alerted Kim and Larry to the presence of their friends. (He was sweeping, for third time that day. She was poised behind the counter, ready to take orders.) They were presently surprised when Gabe and Tara walked in, but even more so to see that Audrey, Barry and Stacy were in tow. \"I can't believe you're actually here.\" Barry admitted to his dare partner. \"You said I should treat myself, right?\" Stacy reminded him. She walked up to the counter, sharing a smile with her best friend. \"Your usual?\" Kim asked. She nodded. \"A regular slice and six breadsticks, coming up.\" At that point, Stacy turned to the rest of the group. They had just chosen a table to sit at. \"What do you guys want?\" Stacy sounded impatient, but mostly everyone thought she was joking. \"You're treating?\" Barry asked. \"Why not?\" She didn't say this with an audible shrug. It was like she was asking why he thought there was a problem with it. \"... It's not really fair, is it?\" Tara chimed in, surprised she managed. Stacy might have been trying to be nice, but she still sounded scary. \"Not with how much I can eat.\" Barry said. \"Fine then. You buy your own food, and I'll treat everyone else.\" \"You don't have to.\" Audrey insisted. She'd already had one friend buy her something out of the blue. Not that she could consider Stacy a friend. This seemed like a way to get votes. \"Why don't we all just split the check?\" Gabe suggested. \"Sounds fun!\" Kim suggested. \"Fun?\" Stacy echoed, from the seat she found next to Barry. \"Yeah, we can all order different things and share, too.\" Barry saw one big problem with this. \"If my brother takes a break to eat with us, I don't think he'll be able to handle that. It sounds like a mess of fingers and food.\" He was just looking out for his twin, but it sounded like he was calling the shots. \"I'll be alright.\" Larry insisted, propping the broom up against a wall behind the counter. \"Forks and knives were invented for a reason. He joined Kim and his other co-workers, to help with the cooking. First, he took down all the orders. While waiting, Stacy took out her phone. She held it up, poised to take a picture. The rest of the group at the table wondered if she realized they were in the shot. She snapped the picture regardless. Barry laughed. \"What're you doing?\" \"Sending this to Gavin.\" After all, she was front and center in the shot. \"Won't that just make him feel bad about not being here?\" Gabe asked, though she'd already pressed send. \"Aw.\" Audrey sympathized. She turned to look over at Larry and Kim. \"Maybe we should've wait 'til your shift was over and visited him at w-\" She was interrupted by the sound of metal crashing to the floor. A bunch of napkins flew out of the dispenser. Larry abandoned his post and went to sweep them up. \"I got it,\" Gabe insisted. \"it was my fault anyway.\" Larry knew that. He'd witnessed it. He hadn't meant to. He'd only caught it out of the corner of his eye. It was the kind of thing that was hard to ignore. From where he stood, it looked like Gabe had knocked the napkin dispenser over on purpose. \"Are you sure?\" \"Sure I'm sure.\" Larry told Kim, as they were locking up for the night. His answer seemed to stump her, which was the reverse of their usual situation. \"But why would he do that?\" It was a rude move. Something that only created more work for people. Gabe's actions made everyone forget what they were talking about. Larry thought that might have been the goal. He shrugged. \"I was hoping you could tell me .\" He said as they made their way to the parking lot. \"What do I know?\" The way she said this, she wasn't tearing herself down. She was just so lost on the subject. \"You know more than you think you do.\" Larry had noticed that since he partnered up with her on the dare. \"Maybe he's just clumsy.\" Kim said. Then, with a laugh, she finished her thought. \"He is to napkin dispensers as you are to lamps.\" Larry smiled, but responded in a low, lost voice. He didn't get it either. \"It seemed pretty deliberate to me.\" \"Well that's… weird.\" \"Do you think it means anything?\" He asked as they reached the car. \"It has to mean something .\" She agreed, sitting in the passenger's seat. \"Maybe Gabe and Gavin are in a fight and that's why he's avoiding him.\" \"I hope not.\" Larry said as he started the car. \"It'd be a shame… if this dare started new friendships but ended old ones?\" It came out like a question because he started to think about it. How this dinner was the most he'd seen of his brother in a while. Everything else was either an argument, some sort of safety drill, or a routine that had begun to get old. \"Yeah.\" Kim breathed back. Though she was thinking about her own old friendship, she asked: \"Are you and your brother okay?\" They drove along slowly. Which spoke less about how cautious Larry was and more about how scared this discussion made him. \"We're not… we're not like we were.\" He admitted. They were no longer attached at the hip. She frowned at this, until he finished. \"But we're not hopeless.\" \"None of us are hopeless.\" She told him, since she needed to hear that just as badly as he did. \"And I think… doing things all together, like having dinner, really helps.\" They were at a red light, so he turned to glance at her. Her smiling eyes were faced toward the road ahead of them. Which seemed fitting. \"It's good to keep at this and… important to remember why we bothered to try.\" \"Why did you?\" \"At first it was for the same reason you did.\" She told him. \"I just wanted to prove I could do it. Make a decision for myself. And I'm still working on that.\" The way he saw it, she was doing a pretty good job. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her smile get wider. \"I like that I can still make friends. It's not as easy as it was before. Kids are their full selves 'cause they don't know how to be anything else. So, whether people like it or not, they get the-\" She searched for the words that would impact Larry the most, and continued. \"unsafe, unsanitary version of someone.\" Unfortunately, all that did was confuse-and disgust-him. \"The… what?\" \"Ya know! The one with quirks and fears .\" He still had plenty of those. He didn't see how people could lose those things as they got older. He also didn't see that Kim wasn't done talking. Until she went on. With words that turned the food that was still digesting in his stomach into pits. \"And… sadness.\" He wanted to look over at her again, since her tone had changed so suddenly. He couldn't, because they were still driving. Aimlessly. \"At some point, you start to feel like you have to hide all those things. So… you pretend you don't have them.\" His next question to her hit pretty hard. \"Is that what happened to Stacy?\" Her answer hurt even worse. \"I think it happens to all of us.\" He pushed at his bottom lip with his thumbnail. She could bet if he was conscious of that, he'd stop. \"I don't like that.\" \"Me neither. That's why I'm such a fan of Radio Rebel. She knows who she is, and she's not afraid to tell anyone.\" He gave her a goofy look in reply. \"Secret identity aside!\" She said, laughing. He laughed back, and Kim suddenly quieted. \"What?\" Larry probed. \"I still don't get why Stacy hates her so much. It's fine not to like someone. Why does she have to ruin it for the people who do?\" Once again, he had no idea how to respond. Except to say: \"What do you mean?\" \"Stacy basically gave Principal Mareno the idea to expel Radio Rebel.\" She explained. She watched his eyebrows lower. \"...Really?\" She nodded. \"Hey, can we make a little… pit stop?\" He was upset about what she just told him, but glad she thought of something else to say. \"Sure.\" That exchange led them to the nearest pharmacy, where she found herself a package of rice cakes. (He waited for her in the car, thinking the whole conversation over.) Kim set her rice cakes down on the counter. While the cashier rang her up, she thought of something. \"Hey, what do you have that's good for treating eczema?\" Gavin and Audrey were having another game of catch, under 'stadium' lights. \"So a life of fame will be like the life of a vampire for you.\" Audrey supposed. \"You can only come out at night.\" He laughed. On a serious note, he was hoping it wouldn't be like that. Where he was standing helped remind him that he didn't want to lose himself under the lights. \"I'm the same person. I'm not looking for people to love me just 'cause I can play.\" She was surprised the ball landed in her glove, hearing that. \"I'm sure that's not how it is. Not for the people you love.\" He wasn't so sure of that, and told her why. \"I love my fans, too.\" \"It's not the same level. You're a star to your family and friends 'cause you look out for people. And you're… thoughtful.\" At this point, he caught onto what she meant. \"Like how you're a star to your friends and family 'cause you're loyal and you help them bring out their inner hyena?\" He stressed the last word by forming a claw with his free hand. \"Exactly.\" Audrey answered under a laugh. After a pause, she said. \"But it must be exciting. You and the guys are scheduled for an interview with DJ Funky Mac this Sunday.\" She reminded Gavin. \"Then you get to upgrade from your best friend's garage to an actual stage.\" \"And that's...amazing,\" He agreed. \"but I like the garage.\" She nodded. \"'Cause it's safe. The only time people actually see you in there is when he leaves the door open.\" That was no way to get the message of their music across. To stress this, she added: \"Hyenas are wild. \" As a way to encourage him to venture out into the world again. Like he did with the music video. She was glad she had that advice to give. It made her sound like her normal self, which was something he'd been missing for awhile. \"Thanks,\" He appreciated it, but his mind wasn't that far into the future. He was thinking about the following afternoon. \"but this hyena has responsibilities. Like rehearsal tomorrow. By the way, thanks for setting that up.\" She shrugged it off. \"It was Gabe's idea, actually. We'll be there, cheering you guys on.\" \"Our audience of two?\" Gavin mused. \"Tara can handle it.\" She insisted. They'd both seen their fair share of proof. Gabe's garage was the unofficial stage where he and his band performed. It was also a meeting place, where a girl he hardly knew proposed the start of a master plan. That girl sat with him as he played. \"I've never heard that before.\" She said with hushed excitement. \"Neither have I.\" He admitted. \"It's good.\" \"Is there anything I do bad?\" He asked with the raise of an eyebrow. She chuckled. \"I'm sure there's plenty.\" She watched his jaw drop. He scoffed. \"I never thought I'd hear that comin' from you .\" \"There are plenty of things I'm not good at either.\" She admitted. \"I wasn't… making fun of you-\" She stammered. \"I know.\" He interrupted, not wanting her to get worked up. \"I'm messin' with ya.\" \"Oh.\" She said, still embarrassed. She tried to rid herself of that feeling by taking the conversation in a different direction. \"Are you writing something new for the concert Sunday?\" After a long pause, he said. \"Maybe.\" \"That was a tiny 'maybe'. She observed. She knew a lot about those. The kind of 'maybes' that were right next to 'no'. \"I don't wanna mess with the process.\" He justified, though she still didn't see what had him discouraged. She used to think he didn't get that way. \"We're rising stock.\" \" Rising stock ?\" She echoed. Only then did he realize how it sounded. \"You think that's how my step-dad see you? Y-you're not just… some project.\" She assured, upset that he even thought that way. \"And if you have something to say, you should it.\" She used words she knew worked. \"You should reach.\" She thought back to what he'd said in his behind the scenes segment for the music video, and wondered why she hadn't thanked him. That would have to wait til later. When he didn't answer, she tried a different approach. \"Anyway, you can't just play one song.\" \"We have two.\" He knew that wasn't what she wanted to hear. \"Those songs tell me what you do. I wanna know who you are .\" \"Then maybe that's the problem.\" The edge to his tone had been lost in the last few days. \"Gabe?\" Saying his name was a way to get him to calm down, and hopefully open up. That's what Tara had been aiming for. She just hadn't had a lot of luck. \"Not everyone is as nice as you, Tara.\" If they knew who he was, they might not want to know any more. He latched onto a fear Audrey had expressed on the first day of the video shoot. \"I don't wanna be the reason… we don't make it.\" \"You love music.\" He wasn't sure what she was getting at by telling him what he already knew. \"That's why you play so many instruments. You love writing. That's why your pen is out of ink.\" She caught him trying to stifle a smile over that statement. He was surprised she noticed. \" That's why you should do it.\" It wasn't about recognition, or keeping up an image. \"You've got us. You've got people who are gonna relate to what you have to say. It shouldn't matter that not everyone is gonna be on your side.\" He saw what she was trying to do. He was thankful for the effort. The sad part was, she completely missed what really ailed him. A thought he didn't voice. But what if you leave, too ? Barry's phone woke him way before his alarm clock was set to. He rolled over, suppressing a groan of annoyance. Then he fumbled for the phone in the dark. The screen had lit up, but the vibrations caused it to fall off his nightstand before he could get it. He found it on the floor, and turned it so the screen was facing him. Seeing the name displayed there, he was convinced he was still sleeping. It felt like a dream. He accepted the call and put the phone to his ear, speaking in a whisper before the person on the other line had a chance. A sleepy smile graced his face. \"Didn't you say you were gonna delete my number?\" \"It's one of the dumbest things I've ever done.\" Barry wasn't the only one speaking when he should've been sleeping. Gabe and Audrey were having a conversation of their own. \"It was dumb of me not to realize.\" She argued. \"If I hadn't said anything-\" \"I'd still be keeping them away from each other.\" He cut in angrily. Though the anger he felt was directed at himself. She hadn't realized the extent of his actions. \"She didn't feel like having pizza today, huh?\" \"It took some convincing.\" He clarified. \"Not much, but… it was still wrong.\" Audrey saw the upside. \"You're making up for it now.\" He was silent for awhile, then he spoke. It made Audrey wonder if she was getting good enough reception. His voice sounded low and shaky on the other line. \"Maybe this only happened because they told us what we needed to hear. Maybe… if we listened better, we'd know that other people were saying those things, too.\" \"And then it wouldn't mean as much?\" Audrey asked hopefully. This time, Gabe didn't hesitate to answer. \"I think it would mean more...\" Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! Let me know if 1. There's anything you want me to elaborate on 2.

I do not own Radio Rebel \"I'm gonna make the safe bet and say she didn't tell you.\" Barry looked up across the breakfast table at his brother. Safe bets were the only bets Larry made. \"Who didn't tell me what?\" \"Stacy's the reason Mareno decided to expel Radio Rebel.\" That information was withheld to ensure they both got a good night's sleep. Hearing it was a rude awakening. Barry's fork clanked down on his plate. \"I don't even know why I'm surprised.\" Larry knew why. \"You thought you were helping her.\" He said sympathetically. \"I don't know if I wanna help her anymore.\" She'd made progress, so Barry thought, but this seemed to cancel all that out. \"You shouldn't give up.\" Barry's eyes were filled with confusion, and there was a sharpness to his tone. \"She's not making it easy to believe in her.\" \"She never has.\" Larry agreed. \"That's why it had to be you.\" His brother was still eying him strangely. \"...What?\" \"I don't know if anyone else would care enough to try to change her. Kim's her best friend and she just let her be.\" Saying this, Larry looked ashamed of his own dare partner. \"That's what I feel like doing.\" Barry admitted. When he dropped his empty plate in the sink, that seemed to be his way of punctuating his sentence. He didn't notice, but he made his brother flinch. \"Letting her be from a more than respectful distance.\" \"Then try that.\" Larry suggested. Which only confused-and angered-his brother more. \"Whose side are you on here?\" Days ago, he'd said Stacy couldn't change. In that moment, he defended her as if she could. \"I'm not picking sides.\" Larry said, as he took his own plate to the sink. He spoke over the sound of the running faucet. \"I'm saying you should… see if she bothers to make a difference when you're not around to make sure she does.\" \"That's your plan?\" He hadn't meant to, but Barry asked this under a scoff. \"That doesn't sound like a plan at all.\" \"It's not a plan.\" Larry agreed. \"It's a hope.\" His brother shook his head, but that did nothing to take away the confusion he felt. \"But you… always have a plan. You always have to have a plan.\" Barry had one hand held out at his side. He watched his thumb twitch, but then his eyes met his brother. Larry stood there silent for a second. Then, he said: \"Not anymore.\" \"Who are you and what've you done with my twin?\" Barry smiled as he asked this. \"I haven't gone anywhere.\" Larry assured. \"I'm just…\" His eyes settled on the ceiling for a second, as he thought his sentence through. \"I'm glad this dare didn't turn out the way I thought it wouldd. I'm glad you did the crazy thing, and gave the least deserving person a chance.\" Something about the way Larry said that told Barry he wasn't just talking about Stacy. Larry felt like saying the same to Kim. He found himself smiling wider when he answered. He was basically talking in code, knowing what was going on in the corner of his brother's mind. \"I'm glad she took it.\" \"So, don't regret it.\" Larry told him after a pause. \"Just make sure it's not wasted. See what she does with a warning.\" To his surprise, the reply he got was: \"This seams mean.\" Barry had gone about this whole thing without letting himself get pushed around. Why did he suddenly think he shouldn't put Stacy in her place? Whatever the reason, Larry justified this plan that wasn't a plan in three words: \"It's tough love.\" Barry blinked. The shock he felt was around the same level of how he reacted to finding out what Stacy had done. \"What?\" \"You know what I mean. There are different kinds of love. Most of which don't scare me half to death.\" They both laughed. \"What am I gonna do while I'm out of a dare partner?\" Larry shrugged as he found the keys to the car. (Which wasn't difficult, since he always put them back in the same place.) \"You can hang out with me and Kim if you want.\" It was a nice offer, but Barry didn't know if it would go over well. \"Won't Kim notice someone's missing?\" He asked with the raise of an eyebrow. \"She is sharp!\" Larry replied, wagging his pointer finger in the air for a second. He saw his brother nod in agreement-laughing silently-and added: \"Sharper than most people think.\" \"Yeah.\" Barry responded, feeling bad about that. \"Sharper than she thinks.\" Larry revised in a low voice. \"Yeah…\" Barry said under a sigh. That felt even worse to know. \"I don't think she'll mind not having Stacy around.\" Larry said. \"I think she'll get it.\" Barry didn't see how. \"We're exiling her best friend.\" \" No ,\" Larry's tone started out stiff, but it softened. That didn't make what he said any less important. \"we're teaching her a lesson. Kim will get it.\" He reiterated. \"Are you sure about this?\" Given Larry's cautious nature, he wasn't sure about much. This, he knew. \"Absolutely,\" He assured. Then he gave Barry his reason why. \"because she's the one that told me.\" \"I meant to thank you.\" Tara told Gabe as they walked the halls of Lincoln Bay together. He'd been quiet up until that point. Silenced by sorrow. It surfaced a bit in his speech. \"What are you thanking me for?\" She almost stopped walking. Those words weren't casual. He sounded like he didn't think he deserved her thanks. \"What you said about me. In the video.\" \"I just wanted you to know that what you said stuck with me. I wanted other people to know, too.\" That was his first attempt at reaching. Minor as it was. \"You don't have to thank me. It was your advice. It was good advice.\" She appreciated that. She still had some thoughts on the video, though. \"If you hadn't talked about me, do you think anybody would've noticed I was even there?\" She said this like she had already brushed it off, but he didn't like the sound of it. \"Most of this was your idea. We aren't gonna let you go unnoticed. You aren't gonna let you go unnoticed.\" As Radio Rebel, she had quite a voice. He heard Tara loud and clear, too. \"Most days I do. I like it better like that.\" \"No you don't,\" Gabe replied, almost laughing. He couldn't manage a laugh after what he'd done. Not that she had any idea what he'd done. \"you just feel safer that way.\" \"So you're only happy when you're living dangerously?\" Tara asked, though she had a feeling that wasn't what he meant. \"I'm saying you know what you're risking every time you go on air. They can't see you, but they definitely hear you. For everything you are. You aren't invisible. You just… hide. And I don't think that anything you're doing in that booth is bad.\" He wasn't telling her to give up this gig. He had to make that clear. \"I think you should just take that confidence with you when you leave it. People notice you.\" He said, and though she didn't realize, he stumbled through those words. \"A lot more than you think. You shouldn't be afraid to let them.\" Tara wished she had a better response than \"I wish I wasn't.\" \"Well, I think you're working on it. You didn't have to be there.\" \"It was part of the deal,\" She countered. \"and of course I was gonna come support you guys.\" The bell rang, signaling that they had to go their separate ways. Gabe had one more thought to speak to Tara. In place of an apology she wouldn't understand. \"I want all this attention that isn't even real. And you shy away from the attention that is.\" Those words didn't exactly stick. They struck her. Her head was spinning. And Gabe walked away feeling worse than before. Larry and Kim sat in the library, at the table where their deal was first struck. He had gone there to spend some time reading, but got distracted when he saw some books that hadn't been put back where they were found. She helped him put them back in their proper places, and now the two of them were talking quietly. \"You wouldn't mind if Barry hung out with us today, right?\" \"Of course not.\" She answered. Exactly what he thought. \"Cool. Do you know if he talked to Stacy yet today?\" Kim shrugged. \"I barely got to talk to her. She said she was planning something. Probably campaign stuff.\" She didn't sound disappointed. Which was nice to know. \"Good, then she'll have something to keep her occupied when he's not around.\" \"Yeah.\" She agreed. Though she felt that wasn't enough of a response. \"Sorry I didn't tell you before. I didn't think about how you guys would feel.\" \"It's okay. I don't really know how I feel about it. Stacy never liked Radio Rebel, but I didn't think she would do something like that.\" \"I don't think she really wants her to get kicked outta school.\" Kim theorized. \"I think she just got Mareno to put the threat out there so she'll stop broadcasting.\" \"That's not any better. And it's not gonna happen.\" \"I know,\" When she said this, she sounded defensive. Then her tone turned worried. \"but what's gonna happen to Stacy?\" Larry didn't see what she meant, so he asked. \"Part of what made me take this dare was knowing I wouldn't be alone.\" Kim explained. \"I didn't have to miss being her shadow. Now I don't miss being anyone's shadow.\" She sounded confident, but she meant this as reassurance. She didn't want Larry to worry that he was treating her the same way. I've got you. And she had Barry. Now she's got no one.\" \"We're still here for her.\" Larry argued. Though it took a moment for him to think of something to say. \"We just wanna see what she does when no one's telling her what she should do.\" \"Like… trying to treat us all to pizza?\" Neither of them knew what that had really been about. \"A little more serious than pizza.\" Larry said with a light laugh. \"Like not trying to ruin someone's life just because she's jealous of them.\" Kim bit her down turned lips. \"Jealous?\" \"Yeah,\" Larry said. \"I know jealous when I see it.\" She was still digesting that information when she heard him repeat himself. Even lower the second time. \"I know jealous when I see it.\" His brow furrowed, and he looked at Kim to see if she knew what he was thinking. She didn't. \"Yeah, I believe you.\" She told him, as if he needed convincing. Larry looked at her, wide-eyed. \"Do you think he was jealous?\" She looked back at Larry, suddenly lost. \"Wait, who are we talking about now?\" \"Gabe.\" She didn't see how that could be. \"How could he be jealous of his best friend?\" Yet again, Kim had Larry stumped. Then he thought about it. Even though he felt rude for saying so, he told her: \"I kinda thought you were.\" Her focus on him got sharper in that moment. \"Before we started hanging out.\" He didn't think that would lessen the blow any. \"And then a little bit after we started hanging out?\" She asked, thinking back on their shopping trip. He swallowed a sigh, but she saw his shoulders sag. \"Sorry. I think I got kinda scared. But I was scared to tell you I was scared.\" \"What were you scared of?\" That could be a long list. Larry's hands clasped together, but this time that didn't happen so he could psych himself up. He was about to admit something he only realized in hindsight. \"You know how I was so worried about you trying to be like Stacy?\" She nodded, and he sighed silently. \"That's because I was there.\" Kim's eyebrows raised. \"Okay, I doubt you mean you were trying to be like Stacy .\" This almost made him laugh. Then she caught onto what he meant. \"Wait. You mean… Barry?\" Larry nodded as his eyes found the floor. It turns out, he was jealous of his own best friend. \"I knew I wasn't like him. I didn't wanna be like him,\" He explained in a low voice. \"I just wanted to be liked on the same level that he is.\" He watched as Kim's jaw dropped. \"You are !\" A shush rang out from behind the circulation desk. \"You are .\" Kim repeated quietly, to show she was listening and make sure she was heard. \"I realize that now,\" He assured. \"it just took awhile to figure out.\" After a pause, he added: \"And sometimes I forget.\" The whole truth was that sometimes he let himself forget, because-the way Larry looked at it, being less popular meant he had less to worry about. Less responsibility. Kim knew the feeling, but she didn't say so. \"I guess we'll just have to keep reminding you, then.\" \"I appreciate that,\" He told her. \"but I hope I don't have to be reminded too often.\" In the parking lot after school, Stacy recalled how Barry basically threw himself in front of her car to get her attention. Now it seemed she'd have to recreate the scenario just to get him to talk to her. She was an expert at avoiding people, but he went the extra mile when it came to that. If she hadn't seen him walking out to the car, she might've thought he was absent from school that day. \"Hey, where've you been all day?\" There wasn't an ounce of anger in her tone. In fact, it stretched past curious and crossed over into concern. \"Staying out of trouble.\" He replied, without even turning around. He tossed his brother's keys in the air and caught them. At this point, concern turned into confusion. \"Why would you be in trouble?\" Finally, he looked at her. Disappointment clouded his eyes. Most of it was directed at her, but he also hated how cold he was being. \"Have you ever heard the expression 'You are the company you keep'?\" Rather than a nod, she sent him an odd look. Asking for elaboration. \"Yeah, well, I thought you were shaping up to be good company.\" \"Wait,\" Stacy said this flatly, but then her voice rose. \" I'm the trouble? How am I trouble?\" \"By trying to get people in trouble.\" He could see she still wasn't understanding, so he clarified under a sigh. \"Radio Rebel and everyone who listens to her.\" Stacy blinked. \"But you knew that when we started this-\" \"I didn't know you were trying to-\" Barry was so frustrated he not only interrupted her, he interrupted himself. \"It's fine if you don't like her. Whatever, really.\" When he said 'whatever', he meant it in the way that she usually did. \"But...\" He held his hands up before he continued, showing he was exasperated while trying to stress his point. \"This is someone's education that you're trying to jeopardize. This is someone's life . You're only gonna make it worse.\" She wanted to say something, but her tongue stayed still. \"Some kids need her show,\" Barry went on. His tone was softer, but still somewhat sharp. \"They rely on it. You know how you taught me about presentation?\" No, actually, she didn't. As evidenced in her shocked expression. \"I taught you something?\" Stacy asked. \"Sure.\" He said. \"And I'm sure you taught me more,\" His voice got louder again. \" but I'm too mad to think right now !\" She wasn't sure if the sound that left his lips next was a scoff or a curbed sob. He had to take a breath before he spoke again, calmer this time. \"You think it's gonna matter once this gets out? Stacy, I'm not that high up on the totem pole and I found out. The more people know, the less of a chance you have at being prom queen.\" He could tell that hit hard but he just kept going, making quite a scene for the cars they stood crammed in between in the otherwise empty parking lot. \"If this gets back to Gavin and his fans,\" Barry went on, shaking his head slightly. \"it's out of the question.\" \"But-\" At first, she was going to protest. As far as the majority of the student body knew, having Radio Rebel expelled was Principal Mareno's idea. Bringing that up would only make Stacy look worse. She wasn't trying to make trouble. Not anymore. \"I can't fix this unless you help me.\" \" This is how I help you. By leaving you alone.\" But I don't wanna be alone . She thought, under the impression that he meant forever. She was saddened, but it all came out as anger. Especially because she didn't understand why she was so sad. \"This was your idea. Okay, technically, it was Audrey's idea but you're the one who roped me into it.\" \"Well, I'm cutting the rope.\" He thought she'd be satisfied with this. She wasn't. \"It feels more like you're burning it.\" The way she said this, it was as if the metaphorical rope was still tied around her when he set fire to it. \"You'd probably prefer that over spending time with me.\" He mumbled, wondering if her distaste for him had ever really dissolved into tolerance. He was starting to doubt everything he'd done for the dare. \" C'mon ,\" She shouted, behind gritted teeth. \"I'm trying -\" \"To weasel your way out of this.\" He matched her volume, but his voice lowered again when he realized she made no effort to talk over him. \"Make it my job. It's not gonna work.\" \" No , I-\" She stopped when she saw what looked like a prolonged blink from Barry. He had his eyes closed to calm himself down. He was over trying to fight, and he was over trying to fix her. In that moment, doubt won. \"I don't think it was ever gonna work.\" \" BARRY!\" She didn't have to yell. She had his attention, but only for that moment because she'd lost his respect. He showed this by holding up a hand and delivering a line Stacy tossed around whenever she got tired of listening. \"No words.\" There was no room for him to make a dramatic exit. He had to squeeze himself through the small space between Larry's car and the one parked next to it. (Either that, or he'd have to go around the other side and-even more awkwardly-make his way over the center console.) All while Stacy stood there staring at him in disbelief. When he started the car, he looked in the rearview mirror to find her in the same spot. She thought about staying there, knowing he'd stop. She'd done that back when she couldn't stand the sight of him. Barry would stay there as long as she did, but he wouldn't speak. After that, he'd run out of things to say. Stacy tried to stomp away, but from where he sat it looked more like drifting. \"I gathered the troops. Or the… troupe.\" Audrey revised as she gave Tara and Gabe a smile. The two of them sat on Audrey's living room couch, the space she'd occupied between them still open after she got up. Gavin's laugh came over the other line. \"I like that.\" He told her, regarding the pun. Even though Gabe wouldn't be doing any acting. \"Sorry I'm late.\" \"Don't be mad.\" Gabe told Audrey. Then, jokingly, he added: \"His watch is broken.\" The joke would've been a total miss if Gavin wasn't on speakerphone. \"I'm not mad,\" Audrey assured. \"And you're not late. They just got here first.\" Actually, Gabe got there before Tara. She wanted to head over with him, but when she sent him a text to ask about that, she found out he was already there. She found it strange. He was really only there for moral support. Tara and the others were the ones who had to rehearse. Maybe Gabe's watch was broken. Or maybe he was avoiding another one-on-one conversation with Tara. The last one hadn't gone very well. She looked over at him as she mouthed her lines, but his eyes were on Audrey. She had just hung up the phone. He'd never seen someone look so worn out over such a short conversation. \"Hey, Audrey,\" Tara said rather randomly. \"do you think all the GGGG's true fans will start coming out of the woodwork now that the music video's up and the concerts happening soon?\" That question landed Gabe's attention on Tara, but only for a second. Then he looked back to Audrey, who didn't have to think about her answer. \"Depends what you mean by 'true fans'. Lincoln Bay is full of GGGG's fans.\" \"Well, yeah. Those kids actually know the guys.\" With that, Gabe saw the point she was trying to get at. And Audrey said it aloud. \"You don't have to know someone personally to be their fan. I mean, look at Radio Rebel. Even the people that know Radio Rebel don't know they know Radio Rebel.\" Not only was this a good point, it made Tara and Gabe laugh. \"So the guys should embrace that attention? Even from fans they aren't friends with?\" Audrey nodded. \"Gabe, you don't have a problem with that, do you?\" She asked this as a joke, not knowing it was a serious issue for him. \"I'm trying not to.\" He answered. \"Oh.\" Audrey sounded disappointed in herself for not realizing this, but Tara gave her a look that told her she didn't have to be. She wasn't alone in that. \"I guess Gavin's not the only one who needs to work on that.\" \"I think Gavin has a completely different problem.\" Gabe admitted. \"It's like…\" He thought of a way to express what he was thinking, but it didn't make much sense to him even as he said it. \"It's like he doesn't wanna shine.\" That made total sense to Tara. Kim was off having fun somewhere with the twins. That's how it was for her. She didn't have to worry about as much because all eyes weren't on her. They were on Stacy, who was now tasked with fixing her own mistake. She really had no idea how to go about that. School was already out. Mareno wasn't around when Barry delivered his ultimatum. Up until that point, it seemed he wouldn't ever grow tired of hearing Stacy talk. She felt this way seeing the timecode at the top of her call log. He was the last person she talked to. For 43 minutes and 11 seconds, apparently. She couldn't really remember what they discussed, but it must've been interesting since he kept her attention that long. She was stuck by late-night inspiration. Something good for the campaign that she wished she could recall. Although she didn't expect a response, she texted Kim for inspiration on what to do next. Since spontaneity was supposed to be her new strong suit. Unfortunately, Kim was fresh out of that. In Stacy's eyes, it had all been wasted on whatever she and the twins were up to. Stacy read the response she got, surprised how quickly she received it. Not to mention she was surprised she heard back from Kim at all. Retrace your steps. What else can you do? Without Barry, Stacy didn't have an answer for that. Gabe had been the first to show up for rehearsal at Audrey's house, and he would be the last one to leave. \"You guys did good.\" He told her. \"So did you.\" Audrey replied. He gave her an odd look. \"Yeah, it was a real challenge for me to sit down and shut up.\" She laughed. \"I imagine it would be for someone so used to being in the spotlight.\" He didn't take offense to this, but he didn't find it funny either. \"That's not what I meant, though.\" Audrey said in a quieter tone. He was lost. \"What did you mean?\" \"You just let them be,\" She said, sitting back down again. She'd been on her feet since before Gavin got there and after he and Tara left. With them gone, she could've chosen to sit on the opposite side of the couch. But she didn't, and that only seemed to emphasize the words she used to finish her thought. \"and let them be close.\" She watched as his hands clasped together. Unlike when Larry did this to psych himself up, the motion was slow and produced no sound. \"I knew she liked him. It took seeing them rehearse for me to figure out it really is a mutual thing.\" He frowned, but Audrey didn't know the part he found most upsetting until he spoke next. \"I don't wanna mess with that.\" Audrey looked at Gabe. For a few long seconds, she said nothing in reply. He thought that was because his actions hadn't spoke for that. Until she admitted something that surprised even herself. \"...Me neither.\" It came as a shock to him because she'd been avoiding Gavin for that exact reason. She didn't see it that way because doing so had only made Gavin more curious about and concerned for her. \"It's not… all our fault.\" Gabe reasoned. His tone got a little edgy then. \"You wanna talk about spotlights? We don't get to choose who we see in them.\" His clasped hands were now facing down. \"You're right.\" She said under a sigh. \"I think it's our job as their best friends to push them together.\" The way Gabe said this, she could tell the job still wasn't one he was happy to take on. \"I've pushed,\" Audrey said. \"I think they just lost momentum.\" He laughed. Then he gave it some thought. \"This had to help, though.\" \"Rehearsal?\" She didn't see how it could. \"Why? Most of their interaction was scripted.\" Gabe nodded. \"But there's a lot in a script that… lines up with their lives.\" He explained. \"So the more they say that stuff, the more they see it.\" Audrey wanted to believe that. It would give her and Gabe a break if other things-maybe even other people-were pushing Tara and Gavin together. Something just didn't add up, though. \"Can't be all that similar.\" Audrey said. \"Tara's got nothing to hide.\" Gabe's reply rolled right off his tongue. \"Yeah, maybe, but that doesn't stop her. She's so sure of who she is, but not everybody gets to see that. That's why it's so ironic that I like her.\" He realized. What he didn't realize was that he was still talking. \"I want the world to see who I am, but I don't even have that figured out.\" Audrey's mouth dropped slightly. She didn't know what to say. The only response she had in mind was, naturally, a dramatic one. She didn't know if Gabe would allow that. She stood up again, with her arms reined in at her sides and reaching out. He looked at the palms of her hands. He could sense the sorrowful look in her eyes. That's when he caught on to how much he'd revealed, and the comfort she was offering for that revelation. She looked like she could use a hug, even though she thought he was in need of one. At first, he felt he only accepted the offer to make her feel better. It ended up helping both of them. She wasn't sure when to let go, knowing he wasn't much for this kind of thing. So, she left that up to him. It wasn't a record-breakingly long hug, but it was something they both didn't know they needed. The first thing Stacy had done as Barry's dare partner was toss Barry's hat up in a tree. To retrace that step, she had to go back there. She'd let too much time go by to do anything else. Stacy looked up at the branch above her head, that seemed to hang there mockingly. Barry's red cap still hung on. It was dirty now, and had some leaves caught in. A sorry sight. Sorrier still was how she winced and whined. Stacy stood straight up and stretched. It was no use. She got close, but not close enough. With a sigh, she voiced the thought that crossed her mind. \"I'm gonna have to climb.\" It wasn't easy, especially considering how she was dressed, but she made it. Back on the ground, she shook the leaves out of the cap. Then she got back in her car and drove home. The hat rested on the seat where Barry once sat. She wouldn't have him to guide her in her campaign as long as he was mad. She would have to find her own way if she wanted him to forgive her. There was an odd comfort in having something of his to hold onto until then. \"Just in time.\" Tara said in a relieved tone as Gabe strolled into SLAM. She was beginning to think he wasn't going to show up. He'd made a promise to be there for her, and he didn't plan on breaking that promise. \"Just in time.\" He echoed with a smirk. Tara got back to getting ready, knowing she had mere minutes before she had to go on air. Cami walked over to Gabe, with her arms crossed. She spoke in a whisper. \"Keeping your distance?\" She asked. That was all it took for her to know she was on to him. He was only upset because he still felt guilty. Having Cami know why was actually reassuring. She could help keep him in check. \"That's the smart thing, right?\" \"Smart,\" She agreed with a nod. \"nice… tough.\" That last one caught him off guard. As did what she said next. \"Trust me.\" He wanted to respond, but in that moment he couldn't form words. She gestured to the room they stood in. \" This isn't my hardest job. Being a friend can take a lot of sacrifice.\" Cami said, making sure Gabe didn't look away from her. \"You have to decide what's worth more to you.\" Kim watched as the clock in her living room stuck 7. \"I'm interfering with your quest. Are you mad at me?\" \"Do I look mad at you?\" Barry asked with a smile, from his side of the fort. This one stood taller than the one of he made with pillows at Stacy's house. It had cushions and blankets, too. \"It's kinda hard to tell.\" Kim admitted. The blinds were drawn and all the lights were off in the living room, and the only light was the one built into her phone. \"I'm not mad.\" He clarified. Saying this, she could tell she wasn't the only one he spared his anger. He didn't even have the energy to still be mad at Stacy.\"We all needed this for something.\" He thought Audrey's idea was brilliant, but didn't get a chance to say so. Larry returned from the kitchen carrying a plate of s'mores. \"What we don't need is sugar, sugar and… more sugar. But we can indulge.\" He set the plate down and sat across from the others, listening to them laugh happily. Kim took her pick, but before she ate she she said: \"Y'know, as your hostess, I probably should've made these myself.\" Larry shrugged that off. He didn't mind being the baker. \"It was a fun mess.\" Barry nearly choked hearing that. It was only shocking because Larry was the one to say it. \"Fun mess, huh?\" Barry's tone was a lot more calm than his expression. Those words weren't typical coming from his brother. Larry had to smile as he nodded. \"Like life…\" Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! Let me know if there are any spelling/grammar/phrasing mistakes, and if you have any ideas. I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 10] My lovely readers, I wanna apologize for three reason. I always feel like it's a long wait between chapters, this one is shorter than usual, and it would've been up sooner but it seems the site was having problems the past few days. Hope you enjoy! This chapter is dedicated to DannySamLover20 and AmandaSimmons95. I don't own Radio Rebel Part of Radio Rebel's Tuesday night SLAM segment stayed with the group. Even Stacy, who normally pretended not to care what she heard. \" Sometimes we're not okay. Sometimes we don't even know why we're not okay. But that doesn't mean things won't look up. Everyone has off days. For some, it's more than just a day that's off. But it helps to find people to talk to. Even on the days where you don't know what to say.\" Stacy knew why she wasn't feeling okay. Annoying as he could be, Barry had kept her motivated. Even when he wasn't around to help her out, she was reminded to do some good. That got her up early, prepared for a day of retracing her steps. Her dare partner was on the way to school, wearing a cap he hadn't had in his possession for days. \"So… this was just sitting in the mailbox?\" Larry couldn't look at him when he replied. He had to keep his eyes on the road. \"Sparkling clean.\" He said with a smile. \"No note or anything?\" \"You know who it's from.\" Larry reasoned. \"Yeah, but… I expected a 'Here's your stupid hat back' or something.\" Barry explained as they pulled into the parking lot. The walked toward the front doors of Lincoln Bay, but stopped walking when they saw Kim sitting on the steps. \"Trying to trip me up again?\" Larry teased, both surprising and confusing his brother. She giggled. \"If I was, I'd be just tripping you, period. Tripping you up is like…\" She trailed off, then looked to Barry. \"How do you explain that?\" He shrugged. \"I don't know, it's never happened to me.\" He joked. Like he'd never made a mistake. He still wanted to believe that helping Stacy out would work out well. He wanted to believe that he hadn't struck himself a raw deal. Not wanting a lull in the conversation, Kim said: \"Hey, I haven't seen that in awhile.\" referring to Barry's flat cap. \"Wasn't it stuck in a tree?\" Larry asked his brother. \"Yeah.\" He confirmed. Then he looked back at Kim. \"Stacy got it back for me.\" Kim looked baffled, especially when Larry said: \"Barry probably has you to thank for that.\" \"Me?\" Larry nodded. Even his twin didn't see what he meant, so he made it clear. \"I think when you… showed an appreciation for my sense of style, it inspired her.\" Kim giggled, thinking back on when she showed up to school in mismatched clothes. \"I don't think so.\" \"Makes sense to me.\" Barry said after some thought. \"You inspired Larry to have more fun, so maybe you inspired Stacy to be nicer. See my side a little.\" \"Nah, I think that's all you.\" Larry wondered why Kim didn't want to share some of the credit. Especially because she was the one to tell Stacy to retrace her steps. \"I have to agree with my brother on this one.\" \"Well, I guess when she's back to being Barry's dare partner… we'll ask her.\" Kim decided. The group, minus Stacy, found each other during lunch. They were sharing a table, and discussing a new idea Audrey had. \"Kim, you inspired me.\" In response to this, the twins wore matching smirks. \"How?\" She asked, while she tried to pretend she didn't notice. \"Because you didn't let Barry be alone while Stacy's on dare probation.\" Audrey answered, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"The warden's on probation.\" Gabe whispered to Tara. \"How ironic.\" She was the only one who really heard him, even though she was waiting on Kim's response. \"Oh, well, thanks.\" She said with a bright smile. \"How was hanging out last night?\" Everyone looked interested to hear about that. Even if Kim's reply would make the most sense to the twins. \"It was a fun mess.\" \"That sounds amazing.\" Audrey said, looking around at the others around the table. \"It sounds like something that none of us should miss out on.\" Gabe held out his hands in a show-offy way, which was tricky since he was crammed in between his best friend and dare partner. \"It's always fun with the GGGG's. Even just half of 'em.\" \"Perfect,\" Tara said while Gavin laughed silently. \"because with us it's alway a mess.\" Her tone was soft, but no one held back their laughter. \"So we balance each other out.\" Barry said. \"We shouldn't waste that.\" Gavin said, trying to see all their points. He looked across the table at his dare partner. \"You want us to starting hangout out as… as this.\" He said, realizing the plan was already put in motion before anyone but Audrey knew of the plan. \"I know we all have our obligations,\" She said, without even knowing what all those obligations were. She felt that this plan of hers was more important. \"but we managed to squeeze in time for the dare, so…\" She trailed off. \"Why not?\" Tara filled in. Her dare partner backed her up with an echo. \"Why not?\" Audrey sat in the passenger's seat of Gavin's car. They were en route to his job. She waited until he was parked to show him the pictures she'd been swiping through on her phone. From Stacy's fanpage. \"Barry is not gonna be happy about this.\" She said, showing Gavin the screen. He looked over to see pictures of his prom date that she took herself, just minutes earlier. In each one, she was modeling a different hat. \"Kim told her to retrace her steps, right?\" He asked, his voice quiet with disappointment. \"I'm guessing they didn't do any shopping.\" \"Nope.\" Audrey said, to confirm Gavin's thought. \"Larry and Kim are the ones who went shopping together.\" \"Hmm.\" Gavin said. At first, Audrey thought that was over what she just told him. Though his focus was still on the pictures. \"It looks like she's in a thrift store.\" They had never known Stacy to shop there. They exchanged strange looks over it. Audrey had a theory. \"Maybe she's trying to channel Barry's energy and wasn't sure which hat to use to do it?\" With a happy laugh, Gavin opened up his door. He wasn't sure how else to answer. Even if Audrey's theory held water, that wasn't a good way for Stacy to show she was taking the campaign seriously. It just looked like she was spoiling herself. Oddly enough, as frugally as possible. \"Whoa, what do we have here?\" Asked the woman at the front desk of the nursing home. She was referring to the box Stacy brought in. \"Lucky hats for everyone involved in the Bingo game Barry and I were in charge of Saturday.\" \"Oh, how nice of you.\" The woman said. Though Stacy noticed she didn't smile until the mention of Barry's name. This was because she wasn't following what she was saying before then. Guilt over the situation Stacy landed herself in kept her from seeing that. \"It was nothing. I got them at a thrift store, but I washed them all before coming here.\" The woman could tell that just by the way they smelled. She was actually wishing she could keep the box at the desk a little while longer, so that she could enjoy the fresh scent. \"Washing hats? That sounds complicated.\" Stacy shrugged that off. \"I've had some practice.\" After a pause, she said: \"I have to get going.\" \"Okay. What would you like me to tell the residents?\" Stacy's answer took no hesitation. \"Lucky hats courtesy of Barry.\" The woman laughed, out of surprise. \"But you brought them.\" \"He gave me the idea.\" She reasoned with a smile. The lounge at SLAM had become one of Tara's favorite spots. Especially now that she not only shared it with Cami, but Gabe as well. \"Now that you're in the club, it's about time you got your own mug.\" Cami said to Gabe. \"Thanks.\" He told her. Then, as an afterthought, he added: \"I'm surprised yours isn't striped.\" In response, Cami just laughed and took her seat at the table. \"Great job tonight, Tara.\" Tara appreciated the compliment. It was touching because having a secret identity meant not many people could say that to her face. \"You too.\" \"Doesn't she just push buttons?\" Gabe teased. \"During my segment, yeah.\" Though, next to Radio Rebel, Cami Q was easily SLAM's most popular DJ. \"That takes talent.\" Cami insisted. She had to know the right buttons to push. She knew how to do that in the figurative sense, too. \"That's why we don't let you near them.\" She said to Gabe. He nodded, as if to say he deserved such a comeback. \"You are great at moral support though.\" Tara informed him. Though doing so didn't mean she condoned his teasing. He didn't see her words as much of a comfort. In fact, they made him feel worse. If only about himself. \"That's 'cause all I have to do is show up .\" \"That's not true.\" Cami argued. \"This dare is a compromise. Tara's giving you the best resource she has for getting your band exposure-\" \"and what am I giving her?\" He interrupted. \"Encouragement.\" Tara supplied. Surprised at how quickly she spoke. She could see in Cami's expression that it surprised her, too. She also had something to add. \"Along with less of a burden in keeping this secret.\" Neither of them wanted Gabe to feel like he wasn't pulling his weight here. \"Only one person took shortcuts in this dare.\" Cami had heard about the situation with Stacy. And though none of them knew how that would turn out, Tara was sure of one thing. \"She's paying for it now.\" \"When did you learn to rollerblade?\" Barry had seen Larry's new rollerblades leaning against his closet door that morning. Which was to be expected, as his 'neat freak' brother never left anything lying around the house. \"Kim taught me.\" Larry told Barry, gesturing toward her kitchen door from where he sat on the living room couch. \"Okay, that doesn't exactly answer my question, but it makes sense.\" She had a knack for getting Larry to loosen up. \"She's a lot of fun to hang out with,\" He began, before lowering his voice. She was in the next room, and he didn't want to offend her. \"but it seems like every time we talk… she asks me something I don't have the answer to. It makes me nervous.\" \"That's typical of you.\" Barry said with a laugh, knowing a lot of things made his brother nervous. He was about to ask what kinds of questions she had, when she interrupted his thoughts by reentering the room. \"A healthier snack this time.\" She said, putting a tray of rice cakes down on the coffee table. Barry took note that none of them were touching, which he could bet was done for Larry's benefit. She took a snack for herself, but before biting into it, she asked: \"So, have you guys gotten used to just listening to Radio Rebel by now? Minus the whole stakeout aspect?\" \"Yeah, it's actually good to have a break from that.\" Barry admitted. By the look on his face, that was something he never thought he'd say. \"Is listening to Radio Rebel any different for you now that we're around?\" Larry asked Kim. Since her mouth was full, it took her a few seconds to reply. She was glad to be stalled by her own chewing, because she hadn't thought about the answer until he posed the question. \"Well… I don't have to listen to Stacy complain after every segment. \"That's a nice change. Even if I get where she's coming from.\" That last bit of information came as a shock to the twins. Larry nodded. He didn't want to press the matter any more. He felt like he was opening up an old wound. \"What does she say?\" Barry asked in a whisper. By his brother's count, it's like he was pouring salt right into that old wound. Kim ran a hand through her hair as she spoke. \"I don't know if you guys have noticed, but…. Radio Rebel's kinda… weird .\" \"That's why we love her.\" Barry reasoned. \"She's one of us.\" Larry added. Now that he knew this conversation couldn't be avoided, he saw no reason not to contribute to it. A look of guilt entered Kim's eye because she was spilling someone else's secret. \"Well, it bothers Stacy because Radio Rebel gets praised for the same weirdness that… she was outcast for as a kid.\" While the boys' jaws dropped, her eyebrows drew together at the thought that crossed her mind. \"I guess Stacy just wants to figure out how Radio Rebel made it work.\" Gavin and Audrey were having another game of catch before they had to go home for the night. \"That was an… interesting experience.\" Audrey said of going to work with him. \"It's doesn't really count as an acting gig, but it helps.\" He needed whatever money he could scrounge up to put toward putting the GGGG's on the map. Even if he had to get it by dressing up as a giant sub. \"It's definitely different.\" She agreed. \"Instead of selling a story, you're selling a sandwich.\" It wasn't the most serious job, but it was a job Gavin did well. The both laughed, and then Audrey said: \"You'll be ready for a real performance on Sunday.\" Hearing that, he almost failed to catch the ball. \"I really hope so.\" He said this more to himself, but she overheard. She knew it hadn't been easy for him, adjusting to being under a spotlight that seemed to glow brighter with each passing day. \"Aren't you excited? You love music, and you wouldn't have formed a band if you didn't want to share that music with the world . Unless, of course, you're perfectly content with singing to the clutter in Gabe's garage.\" \"It's comfortable.\" He admitted, not seeing what was wrong with that. \"We're working on some new stuff. With less of a party vibe. At first, I didn't get why Gabe was so…. against that.\" Gavin said 'against', but Audrey knew he meant 'afraid of'.\" Which is how she figured out that he was afraid, too. \"It's a new direction.\" A change of pace wasn't the scary part. The consequence of it was something to be feared. \"You might lose fans over it….\" At these words, Gavin took his eye off the ball. So, instead of landing in his glove, it hit him in the shoulder. \"Ouch.\" He said under his breath, wondering if he should even bother to keep the game going. \"Sorry.\" Audrey said in a wince. Knowing she not only made him lose focus, but confidence. \"What I was trying to say is… I don't think you can make a wrong move. Not if what you come up with means something to you.\" \"Thanks,\" He said. Feeling recovered, he picked up the ball. When he threw it her way, he asked: \"but don't you kinda have to say that?\" \"What makes you say that? I'm not your BFFTLEWE.\" She reasoned. \"No… but you are my dare partner.\" \"In that case, I dare you to figure it out.\" She challenged, sparking a smile. \"I can give you all the advice I have. You're the one who has to put it to the test.\" He knew she had a point. What he said next was a genuine compliment. \"Another brilliant idea from the mind of Audrey Sharma.\" \"Thank you.\" She told him under laughs. Almost automatically, she curtsied hearing this. Audrey wasn't sure how it happened, but somehow Gavin's ball ended up in her glove. During their last game, she made sure he took it back with him. Her mind was so preoccupied, she didn't notice the extra weight in her bag. Not while her mind was weighed down by his worry. Even if he left smiling, she know he still had mixed emotions about the concert. She tossed the baseball up in the air a few times and caught it. As she watched it fall back down into her palm, she thought of something. \"Another one of my brilliant ideas.\" She murmured. Then she went to ring the Adams residence. Delilah picked up. \"Audrey,\" She greeted cheerfully, though she sounded like she was in a rush. \"you just caught us. Rob and I were about to leave for a date.\" Audrey answered with an excited gasp. \"Oh, I'll make this quick then. Have fun! Can I speak to him for two seconds?\" \"Sure.\" The woman said, handing her husband the phone. She knew that if Audrey had wanted to speak to Tara, she wouldn't have called the landline. \"Hey there, Leading Lady.\" Rob greeted casually as he got on the line. Her mind was already on the GGGG's, but now she was thinking about her role in their music video. \"Have I thanked you for that a thousand times for that yet?\" She asked in a single breath. \"Audrey, you've thanked me a million times.\" He assured. \"Well then hopefully, this is my way to repay you.\" Rob didn't need to be repaid for the favor, especially since he considered what Audrey did a favor for him, his step-daughter and his step-daughter's dare partner's band. Still, he was just curious to hear what she had to say. \"What do you have in mind?\"... Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! I'm so excited to write about this concert that the next chapter might have a little bit of a time jump. We shall see. Let me know if there's anything you want me to elaborate on, or if their are any spelling/grammar/phrasing mistakes. By this time next week, I'll be back to school. But as always, I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 11] Sorry for the delay, my lovely readers! My laptop was having problems. This chapter is dedicated to DannySamLover20, thedancingmermaid and Amber R (Guest). Enjoy! =] I do not own Radio Rebel \"Barry, are you ready for another fun mess?\" Kim asked this as she held out a box filled with glitter, glue, markers and neon colored paper. Among other art supplies. \"Always.\" He answered, taking the box and ushering her inside. \"But I can't say the same for my brother.\" \"He's done really well at going with the flow lately.\" Kim took a seat at the table, and Barry sat across from her. He saw Larry standing in the doorway. \"Thank you, but I think I might have to draw the line at glitter. It gets in everything and stays there as long as possible.\" Neither of the others could dispute that, but Barry tried to find a happy medium. \"We could always just cut the letters from different color paper. Then the signs would look like giant ransom notes.\" While Kim looked at him bug-eyed, his brother answered: \"That still scares me less than glitter.\" He took a seat next to his dare partner, and she told him: \"Whatever makes you happy, I'm just glad you guys are around to help out.\" \"What else would we be doing on a Saturday morning?\" Barry asked jokingly. His brother had something to add: \"Especially now that Stacy's not using Barry as her campaign manager.\" It was obvious he meant to stress the word 'using'. \"I didn't let her use me.\" \"I did.\" Kim admitted, though she was looking down at the sign she was working on. It was if either of the boys didn't hear. \"What were you getting out of this dare, anyway?\" Larry questioned, as he searched through the box for the dullest pair of scissors he could find. \"I just wanted to be a part of it. I didn't feel like she owed me anything.\" \"And now you do?\" Kim seemed surprised. Barry nodded. \"I feel like she owes my soulmate an apology, for one thing.\" \"What about your apology?\" Larry thought that was in order as well. \"That's not as important to me.\" \"Why not?\" The tone of that question made it a challenging one. Barry stumbled through his explanation, which did not go unnoticed by either of the others. \"Because I could be mean to her, too. But it's not like Radio Rebel did anything wrong.\" Admitting that was even more difficult in front of Kim. Barry didn't like painting himself as the bad guy. And she just couldn't picture him like that. \"Bad how?\" \"I would tease her.\" Barry replied, remembering all the times he brought up her possible crush on him. \"And yeah, she'd tease me, too. But there's a big difference between teasing and threatening, and that's why I think Radio Rebel deserves an apology more than I do.\" \"How do you apologize to someone if you don't know who they are?\" Kim questioned. Barry didn't have an answer to give, but Larry did. \"It wouldn't matter if she called into the show to say sorry. The idea's already in Moreno's head.\" Barry knew his brother was right. 'Sorry' wouldn't fix this. \"But it still means something.\" Barry found himself retracing his steps, much like his dare partner had done during the week. The difference was, he wasn't alone. Larry and Kim went with him to the nursing home, where he saw a lot of familiar people wearing vaguely familiar hats. Kim blinked, recognizing them immediately. \"So that's what she did with them.\" \"Maybe this is part of her apology.\" Larry said, feeling like he'd spoken too soon before. Barry smiled. \"Everybody looks so nice.\" \"Yeah, I thought so, too.\" The three turned to see Stacy, all equally surprised. Before either of them could say anything, she did what they'd been waiting for. She apologized, but not for what they were expecting. \"Sorry, I didn't know you were bringing an entourage.\" She told Barry. Her voice was quiet, but he and Kim both knew that wasn't because she was relaxed. She sounded exhausted, and her appearance reflected that. She owed her eyes being open to the cup of coffee in her hand. She passed another cup over to Barry. \"I'd say you can split it three was, but I don't think Larry would be comfortable with that.\" \"Okay, but I don't really drink coffee.\" \"I know,\" Stacy said. \"yours is hot chocolate.\" Barry smiled and took the cup, while the others by his side looked between each other. \"Thanks. Thanks for being here.\" She seemed to find that strange for him to say. \"It's still kinda my job.\" She understood that this was a weekly routine for Barry, and including her in it was just part of the dare. \"Being on punishment doesn't change that.\" He didn't like thinking about that way. \"Is that the only reason you're here?\" He asked, as the group headed to the room where Bingo was behind held. Larry and Kim wondered what they would do once they got there, since only two callers were needed. \"Actually, the only reason I'm here is 'cause I missed you so much.\" By her dry tone, he could tell she was joking. \"Ah, I knew it.\" \"So, this is the teasing you were telling us about?\" Larry asked, while Kim laughed. Barry raised his eyebrows. \"Clearly my brother and his dare partner find this funny, do you?\" Stacy certainly didn't act like it. \"I don't mind.\" Barry found that hard to believe. \"You don't mind that I've been mistaken for your prom date?\" The others thought that was more teasing. \"You have not .\" Stacy said in disbelief. \"I have so .\" \"Wait, really?\" Kim asked. Larry couldn't help but chime in. \"Why?\" \" How ?\" Stacy added. \"Because I'm helping you with your campaign.\" Barry said matter-of-factly, not offended by the others' curiosities. \"And because you see more of me than you do of your actual prom date. Or anyone, really.\" He added after some thought. \"Not lately.\" Stacy said through a sigh, turning her attention to the cage so that the others wouldn't see the look on her face. \"So, you really did miss me then?\" This was a serious question, but she played it off with a sarcastic side eye. \"We're gonna need a lot of practice tonight.\" Tara looked worried about that. \"Haven't you guys practiced almost every night this week?\" She didn't want the boys to get too tired, and then be unable to play in the show. \"Yeah, but this song's brand new,\" Gabe informed. \"and a lot less scary than the first one I wrote for the concert.\" She chuckled nervously. \"What do you mean?\" To show her, he picked up his guitar to accompany him through the first few lines. She got a voice our whole little world is tuned into, but under pressure she buckles And she's telling me to face down my demons, but I don't need glass in my knuckles When she heard, she couldn't help but just stand there and stare. \"I know it's a little much.\" He told her, putting his guitar back down. \"That's how you see yourself?\" As your own worst enemy?\" She never would've thought that about him. \"Most of the time, no. I don't see you a such a shy little thing most of the time, either.\" \"How do you see us most of the time?\" Tara asked after she took a seat next to her dare partner. She meant that as a harmless question. He knew that, but just by the way she phrased it, he knew coming up with an answer would not be easy. \"Onstage or off?\" \"Both.\" Tara challenged. \"Onstage we're confident. We know what we're doing, and we see the impact we make. Offstage you're not as confident in yourself as you are in other people. And I'm still confident, but not in the things I should be. My mind's still onstage. I have to remind myself all the time that life isn't a show.\" Tara took in all his words, and waited for a little while before weighing in with what she thought of them. \"Sometimes it is. Different situations and people… you have to adjust for. We're not always prepared. Sometimes we have to improvise.\" He smiled, but his smile seemed sad. \"You know what I figured out?\" \"What?\" \"You're so good with people you can't see, and I'm so good with the people who can't see me.\" His fans loved him, but they didn't really know him. He worried that if they did, they wouldn't love him anymore. That's why he swapped the song he wrote out for another one. \"Is that what you wrote about?\" \"The first time, yeah. But I think that's more for just me to know.\" He wasn't going to give away her secret, and he wasn't going to admit he felt fake. Instead, he would show the fans something real. \"You think she'll show up tomorrow?\" \"At the concert?\" Larry asked, after swallowing a spoonful of ice cream. The residents got theirs for free, but they had to pay for it. They wound up splitting both the cup and the cost. Only one part of that surprised him. He watched his dare partner nod. \"As long as I'm there, I doubt it.\" \"What makes you say that?\" Kim looked thoroughly confused. \"I don't trust her like you guys do. She can probably sense that.\" Another shock came to him when she laughed. \"I wasn't talking about Stacy.\" \"Oh,\" He said sheepishly. \"you meant Radio Rebel.\" 'Mm-hm.\" Kim said, since her closed mouth was full. \"Maybe. She might be in the crowd somewhere, but I doubt she'd risk exposure by hosting backstage or something like that.\" \"You're probably right.\" She said, noticing a nervous look enter his eye as he realized they'd eaten too much ice cream to 'stay on their own side'. He put his spoon down. \"Why don't you trust Stacy?\" That question was easy, which isn't what he was used to from Kim. \"I just think she takes too many of her problems out on you and Barry. Without even explaining what those problems are.\" \"She can't hide everything from me.\" Kim countered. \"I am her best friend, after all. And Barry's her dare partner so… he's pretty in tune, too. You don't have to worry about us.\" She insisted. \"We… figured it out.\" He appreciated that, but it wasn't helping. \"I do have to worry about Stacy not feeling welcome in our group of friends because I'm… bitter. His voice sank under sorrow. \"I messed it all up for you guys.\" Kim laughed that off, letting him know he was being silly. \"No, you didn't. If anything, we're fixing things.\" Her eyes lit up at the notion. \"We're seeing what we can handle on our own, and what we need to rely on people for. Like tomorrow, 'cause it's gonna be huge .\" She finished her thought with a smile. Larry liked that idea, but that wasn't what he'd been thinking. \"I thought the whole point of this dare, in Audrey's mind, was to help us not get bored with the monotony of our lives. But I was never bored with it.\" Kim understood. \"You were comfortable.\" \"Now that scares me. If I keep going back to my comfort zone, how much am I gonna miss?\" This was rare, but he'd asked a question that stumped her. He picked up his spoon, scraping it along the other side of the swirl. She laughed with delight, not even caring that he was taking some of her share. The Bingo callers held the doors open while the last of the players were walking or being transported out. \"Don't tell me you don't have anything to wear.\" Barry joked. \"How do you know I didn't donate the rest of my clothes when I was retracing my steps?\" \"Because that doesn't suit your style.\" Barry knew Stacy well enough to know that. \"You couldn't have just one look.\" The look she gave then told him he had her there. \"I did make more donations, though.\" Stacy said, crossing her arms casually. \"Had to take down your fort.\" \"The pillows? All those extra pillows?\" \"Gone.\" She confirmed, though she didn't see why he was so excited about it. \"So digging up all those little luxuries are your way of putting the spotlight on someone else for a change?\" He asked. \"I didn't think about it like that.\" Barry blinked. \"But that was your big idea.\" Suddenly, she remembered that. She didn't comment on it through, because the original lucky hat owner walked by. He smiled, tipped his hat to Barry, then went on his way. She watched for a split second, then turned back to her dare partner. \"So, what's the deal?\" \"What, with him and his hat? Why don't you ask him?\" Stacy seemed somewhat scared, but stubbornness quickly took over. \"He's not my friend. You are.\" \"That's nice of you to say, but you're allowed to make more friends. You're allowed to come to this concert, too.\" They walked out the door, to meet up with his brother and her best friend. \"Okay,\" She agreed. \"but maybe I should sleep in tomorrow.\" That sounded like a good idea to him. \"Have you slept at all the past few days?\" \"Not much.\" She admitted. It wasn't like she could hide it from him. \"You're overworking yourself.\" Barry seemed disappointed in himself, like he could've prevented that. \"No, that's not the reason. I've just had a lot on my mind the past few days.\" Stacy was a few steps ahead of Barry, which annoyed him because he couldn't see her facial expressions. \"Like what?\" He knew she didn't just mean campaign wise. \"You were right.\" She heard his feet practically skid to a stop behind her. \"About what?\" Barry breathed. She turned around to face him. \"I did miss you. I miss a lot of people. I just don't notice unless… I keep busy. That's how it's always been.\" \"It's incredible.\" Tara and her mother marveled at the round stage in front of them. \"Wait 'til you see it in motion.\" Rob told them. The band could hardly wait for that, knowing they'd be onstage in a matter of hours. \"Yet another brilliant idea…\" Gavin began, making his dare partner laugh. \"I just made a lot of last minute work.\" Audrey didn't see a reason to be praised for that. Delilah didn't see why she would worry herself like that. \"Oh, it's gonna be great.\" She said excitedly. \"Best of luck, boys.\" They all thanked her. No one seemed more impressed with the setup than Gabe. \"It shows how much we care.\" He said to Audrey, hoping she would see what the shape of the stage ment. \"It shows that the fans are the most important part of all this.\" He said, imagining them all being able to get in close. \"Aside from the music.\" Audrey added, now glad she hadn't kept the idea for herself. Tara was starting to regret the decision to sit in on soundcheck. The performance was perfect, that wasn't the problem. What worried her was the argument that started before the second song. All the guys except Gabe wanted the save the new song for last. He had to disagree. \"It's a dangerous move.\" \"It's a new direction.\" Gavin countered, no longer seeing anything wrong with that. \"Our set only has three songs. We might as well end it on a note the fans recognize.\" \"This is supposed to be a new start for us. I think we should risk it.\" The others nodded in agreement. \"Not everything has to be a dare.\" Gavin wasn't trying to make it into one. He was taking a chance to see how well he would recover if it went wrong. \"They'll get that it's new for us, too. We all have to adjust. They might not be ready for it, but we have to be.\" \"Okay,\" Gabe agreed. On one condition. \"Let's play it for Tara after 'Turn It All Around', see if she's ready.\" That was the plan, but once the second song wrapped up, she wasn't sure if she could let them go through with it. She knew not everyone would be pleased with her decision, but felt she had to speak up about it. \"Guys, I think I wanna hear this with everyone else.\" She admitted. To her surprise, Gabe actually smiled about this. But he wasn't exactly happy. He just accepted the situation for what it was. \"Ya know, you guys must really be my best friends because you never let me have it easy!\" The boys laughed in response, and Tara walked off to go find the rest of the group. The last thing she heard was Greg on the drums, counting Gabe and the others in. \"This new song is like your secret weapon.\" Cami told the boys as part of her pre-show pep talk. \"Once they hear it, you'll start seeing who your true fans are.\" Rob added. He looked at Gabe then. \"It is scary, but it's something you have to do if you wanna grow. If you ever wanna get outta Seattle. Or, ya know, even just the garage.\" He joked, being met with light laughs and a slight smirk. \"There are some people that are gonna love it no matter what.\" Delilah said. Everyone knew she counted herself in that category. \"Some people that aren't gonna want you to leave Seattle, 'cause they'd miss you too much.\" It surprised the boys how genuinely she meant that, because she wasn't a mother to any of them. Yet she looked at them like they were already stars. \"But if this goes well, and I know it will… they'll follow.\" Some literally, some metaphorically. \"Your stories matter .\" Cami agreed. \"More people should hear them.\" Kim's sign read: 'You So Fly'. She and her friends were so near to the stage, they felt like they were getting VIP treatment. Larry's sign was a perfect recreation of the GGGG's logo. He didn't see it as impressive. He was just trying to be neat about it. Both had to laugh when they finally caught a glimpse of what Barry brought with him, as he proudly showed it off. It looked like abstract art, but there were letters hidden in there. He insisted. He was scanning the crowd for his dare partner, but spotted Tara and Audrey first. They made their way over. \"Thanks for the signs, Kim.\" Audrey said. Her and Tara's had to be held up together, because each one had two G's on it. \"No problem.\" She said. \"Ready for this?\" With those words, the band took the stage. \"We So Fly\" was their opener, and it put everyone in a party mood. When it came time to perform \"Turn It All Around\", the guys had something to say first. \"We wanna thank everyone out there who listened to this song and watched the music video. We really couldn't have done this without you, and we're so happy to be here.\" \"To everyone who helped out on this project, we'll never forget that.\" Greg added. \"We know this is just the beginning.\" Tara and her family wore matching smiles, but Audrey was just in awe of their performance. Every part of it. \"So any time you find yourself in a situation and you're not sure how it's gonna work out,\" Gavin began, knowing that sort of thing was just a song away for him and his bandmates. \"We hope this song brings inspiration.\" Gabe wrapped up the intro. \"Our leading lady's in the crowd tonight.\" With those words, a spotlight shined down on an awestruck Audrey. \"And we couldn't imagine doing this without her.\" Gabe extended his hand, and the crowd went wild. Stunned still, Audrey simply stared. \"Get up there!\" Barry urged with a smile. \"Someone's gotta hold my sign!\" She replied, sparking laughter from her group of friends. \"I'll do it!\" Stacy volunteered. The others realized that-once again-she was standing right behind them. She didn't even seemed put off by having to stand next to Tara. The twins gave Audrey an encouraging push, and she was up onstage with the band. When the music started, Barry rotated his sign, making it finally legible. The words 'Turn It All Around' were written repeatedly, in a kaleidoscope type of pattern. The stage began to rotate as well, looking like some sort of carnival attraction. Two pieces of it spun slowly, switching direction every so often. Since Audrey was unfamiliar with the mechanics, she stayed to one side of the stage. Since it moved, that didn't make her look any less into the performance. Gabe followed her lead by finding his place on the other side, which was surprising in itself. But effective when they wound up looking like orbiting planets or passing ships. Audrey had stood onstage countless times, but it had never felt this exhilarating before... Thanks for reading, PLEASE REVIEW! I ended it here so I could extend a invitation for lyric ideas. Not necessarily specific lines, but themes you would want in the song. I was thinking it would be about the dare as a whole. Questions, theories and corrections are welcome as well. I'll update ASAP! =][Chapter 12]  ","Summary":" Hey FanFiction! This is basically Radio Rebel rewritten, starting from when Tara had her first segm"},{"Movie":"Radio Rebel","Title":"My Best friends girl, and our familys arrangements","Author":"Blue eye beast 93","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9012195","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 'Oh gosh The girl is a dork! She knows nothing about Gavin except for he is a musician, and some of his feelings, blah, blah, blah. She's just a joke. But no way would I ever tell my best friend that, he'd be sure to get angry.' He thinks to myself as he takes his books out, and looks over at the seemingly hippie looking girl, snorting as Tara dropped her school books on the ground. She just blushed and flew down to pick them up. Gabe just rolled his eyes and went over to help her. When they were done picking the last paper off the ground, she looked up at me, than quickly back down to straighten her papers. \"Thanks.\" She mumbled, smiling back towards me, \"That was nice of you, Gabe.\" He smirks, and looks her straight in the eye, \"And I'm usually not?\" She looks taken back ,\"That's-that's not what I meant. . .\" \"Huh, really, than what did you mean?\" He asked, walking away from her, grinning to himself about how awesomely smart of a come back he took. \"Coward.\" \"Actually, Gabe, you're right, you are usually not nice, not at all!\" She said in a loud firm voice back to him. He stopped , and turned to look back at her in surprise. She seemed surprised by choice of words also, as she wordlessly closed her locker, and headed the other direction, fumbling a little bit as Gavin came up behind her, and wrapped his arm around her shoulder. Gabe was still look over at them, when he looked around to see people passing by and staring at him, 'Oh, just great. . .' The bell rang and he walked to his class. His mind wondering onto music, and girls, and than her, the girl who was always quite and shy around him and others had just. . .stood up for herself? \"How poetic.\" He grumbles under his breath, sitting down in his assigned desk. He looked at the girls head behind him. It looked oddly familiar. Than the teacher made the class hand paper back to the people behind them. Once it got to the girl in front of him, she casually turn around with a small smile to hand them to him. But they both paused before the dreaded papers touched his hand. It was Tara. And she had that stupid deer in the headlights look that she got when she couldn't believe what was happening. She quickly turned around, holding the papers, and put her head down. I know we just had one run in, so what was this girls flippin' problem?' Gabe thinks, starting to reach over to her. \"Um, Tara, give me the sheets, pretty please?\" He asks, him arms touching the tips of her shoulders, as he reach both hands around her to try and grab the papers. She crouches forward though as if trying to not look at him. Gabe than realizes people turning to look and whisper at them. She quickly holds up the papers to his face in one hand, \"Huh, here, s-sorry. . .\" He grabbed them quickly out of her hands, and sits back down, \"Dude, what the heck is wrong with you?!\" he ask sharply. She turns a little so all he can see is her red hair and a little side of her face. She nods, breathing, \"Look, I am really sorry. I-I was just shocked is all.\" She whispered back, \"It won't happen again, I swear. . .\" Gabe nods, 'It better not, this girl is being really strange. But why would she hide her face from me? Cause she was scared of me or something?' He thinks about this ands smiles charmingly to the cute girl behind me, and she looks back with as much enthusiasm as he. He cringe when he realizes she's also one of the girls whom is dating the star quarter back, Fred. 'I'm defiantly not that interested!' Gabe say to himself. So he justs turns around and ignores the \"hottie\" for as long as he possibly can. But when he hears her pen drop, he turn around in his seat and look at her. She twirls her long blond hair between her fingers and smiles at me, \"Could you get that for me,. . .Pretty please?\" He hears her pleading girl voice, and cringes. That was one thing he'd always hated about girls when they wanted you to do something, or make a move, they ended up trying to sound like a frickin' baby. \"Yeah, sure, I could.\" he says sarcastically turning away from her shocked expression. \"Jerk!\" she mutters. Than Tara got up, and walked over towards the girls desk, and picked it up. \"Here you go,\" She says at the blond nicely, and went to go sit back down. The blond girl was smiling too, \"What a weirdo.\" She said under her breath, as she started to take notes. He knew Tara couldn't hear her. But for some reason it bugged him a bit. So he looked back at miss blondie, and smiled, \"Not as weird as you just a couple of minutes ago, miss, \"Oh please help me with my pen,\" Pull. Please, just stop embarrassing yourself already. It's called a kind gesture, maybe you should try it sometime.\" her gasp is heard through out the class, as he turn back to face Tara's back. He highly doubts she has supersonic hearing. So he doubt she had heard. 'Thank the Lord, who knows what big deal she would have made out of it. ' He says inwardly to himself, starting to do his homework. She was hurt for a second when she heard Charisse call her weird, as if being nice was weird? She'd just felt so bad for how Gabe was treating the girl, that she'd thought she'd be nice, and try to help the situation. Tara had been about ready to go back to work when she heard Gabe tell Charisse off. She was surprised that he stood up for her. But than started to realize that maybe he was just saying what he was thinking about her. But than why would he say the things about kind gesture? She wasn't trying to be kind to get appreciated. Actually, She had a feeling that she would be made fun of for it. But didn't think right in the middle of are Algebra class! This was just embarrassing. But than Gabe said some nasty stuff to Charisse about how she was the real weirdo. And that started to make Tara feel bad also, because she wasn't that offended by it. \"I can stand up for myself.' She thought determinately. It was just that she knew it didn't matter. She wasn't going to be as low as Charisse was going. And anyways, why was Gabe so concerned for her? Was it because she'd been dating Gavin for about a month now? Did he finally realize how important Gavin really is to her? 'Why can't I just focus on my homework?' she asked herself. Because right now she feels emotional, and ready to thank him a million upon millions of times for standing up for her. But from what she'd gathered from Gavin, Gabe is the drama queen of the group, so he's the one that needs everybody else chill around him. \"So he probably wouldn't like me making a big deal of this.\" She whispers and smiles inspite of herself. He was cool, and so she'd always expected that he was mean. Which he was, but not as much as she'd thought. He might be self-centered, but maybe he had a little more there than she'd thought? Tara turned to look over at him, he had his head down, looking into his homework book like he was truly interested in it. She grinned wanting to say thank you so badly, but just huffed and turned to get back to her studies. \"Hey?\" she heard a voice say, tapping her shoulder. Turning around again to look at him, \"Yeah?\" \"You heard what I said, didn't you?\" He asked, a look of annoyance showing up on his face. She felt her cheeks go steamy warm, \"Um, yeah I did, thanks.\" She still didn't appreciate the attitude, so she just turned back to her studying. \"Just-Just don't tell anyone about it, okay.\" \"Why? she ask him, turning her head a little to ask. \"Because, I don't want people to know I -I, Just don't tell, okay!\" She heard his voice getting impatient, and winced. \"No problem, I don't even want to tell anyone, I really don't care.\" She says simply, and a little frustrated herself. He might have stood up for her, but his temper was causing her to have one towards him. \"Oh. . .\" He says, dumbfound. \"No, I mean I do. But I just don't care what others think of me as much anymore. So it wasn't that big of a deal when- . . .Never mind.\" She says quietly, sighing, wishing this conversation was over. \"Thank you.\" He chuckles. \"Yeah, yeah. You're welcome.\" \"Am I interrupting something?\" The teacher asks, staring pointedly at Gabe and I. I feel my cheeks turn red again, \"No, no, nothing-nothing at all.\" The teacher just glared back at her, \"Well if I am, than maybe it's best to just separate you two?\" She feels herself panic, \"No, really, I'm so sorry, it won't happen again!\" she say quickly. Every one stares at Tara, and she rubs the back of her head, chuckling nervously, \"Sorry.\" \"Okay but I want you and Mr LaViolet to stay quite, is that clear Miss Adams?\" Rubbing down to the back of her neck, she nods, the deer look coming back\"Um, uh, c-crystal clear ma'am.\" \"Good, now lets get moving people, but not to quickly that you don't think about the answer, got it?\" Tara nods, and take one last glance at Gabe. He's just nodding. Not really in a disrespectful way. But like he just doesn't really care, \"Alrighty, Miss Tingermine.\" Than he smiles back at Tara, and winks. She groans, and goes back her work. When the bell rings for lunch, Tara finds Gavin at her locker, waiting for her. \"Hey, how's it going?\" He asks, grabbing her by the arm and pulling her romantically to him. \"Good, but I swear I almost got detention because of Gabe!\" He smiles, wide eye, \"You, detention, never!\" He jokes, kissing her on the cheek. She blushes, \"Yea-yeah, I know, right, totally not my scene.\" She laughs. \"But it's not like it was my fault, Gabe just would stop talking to me for a while. . .\" She said in a cool voice, crossing her arms, \"It was sort of weird.\" Gavin laughed, \"If he did get you in trouble, I know he didn't mean too. Gabe's a nice guy when no ones looking, I'm sure he wasn't trying to cause you any harm.\" I smile at him, thinking what a great boyfriend I've got, \"You know, you are probably right.\" I say, putting my arms around his shoulders. He smiles as he wraps his hands around my waist, \"Yeah, that's me, mister right.\" He teases, coming in closer towards her, his breath hot on her neck. \"Maybe I shouldn't always be so mister right. . .\" he says, looking down at their feet. She feels her smile fade, \"What does that mean?\" He smiles, \"It's just, you know, Gabe is always so awesome at the things he does. Like one time, he ran for hours just so he'd get his music out to one of the biggest record labels manger. He didn't make it in time, so he tried to go into the building. And the way he gets the girls-\" Gavin laughs, than sees Tara's face. Worried, aw man he had worried her, \"Don't worry, I just wish I was as brave as Gabe sometimes. I guess I'm a little jealous of him.\" Tara put her hand gently up to Gavin's face, \"I'll tell you one thing that he doesn't got.\" She says, smiling lovingly up at him, \"Something only you have, and I'd hope you'd think it's more than pretty cool.\" He grins,\"And what would that be.\" Tara's heart beats out of her chest, \"He hasn't got my heart like you have. I-I love you, Gavin.\" Gavin's eyes go blank, \"Oh, . . .thank you, I mean. . .\" Tara starts to feel her hear being ripped out of her chest. Than suddenly someone grabs her, and kisses her. She tries to push away from the warmth of their mouth moving on hers, but the arms wrapped around her wouldn't let her, and she moans a little from the tingles she is receiving from the after math on her lips, and accidentally starts to respond back with kissing them back, but they start to let go. She opens her eyes as she sees it's. . .Gabe? What the heck?! GABE! She is finally able to push him away, and shoves him again , \"Why would you do that?!\" She yells, her face full of horror, as a blush shows up on her face. Gabe shrugs, \"Cause I wanted too.\" He says simply, smirking. \"So I did.\" Than she sees Gavin coming towards him. And the next thing you know Gabe is punched out onto the ground. He just starts to stand back up when Gavin punches him again, \"Gabe, what is wrong with you, huh?!\" He said darkly, \"Why would you do that man!\" Tara is by Gavin in a flash, \"Gavin! Stop this right now! This isn't the way to deal with him!\" She says, looking down at Gabe, she goes down towards him, but Gavin takes her arm, \"Tara, don't-\" he is cut of by her sympathetic face, \"Gavin, you just punched someone. Because you were jealous. I told you I love you, at least trust me enough to help someone whose just gotten hit twice.\" He nods, looking like he was cooling down as he released her. \"Okay, I'm sorry but could you help him? I need to cool down a bit.\" Gavin says, grabbing one of the reliable band mates, \"Hey, would you please help Tara with Gabe. I would, but I think I need to breathe before I kill him.\" he asks, and the guy nods his head, \"Sure thing man.\" the band mate says, patting him on the back, and giving a stern fatherly look at Gabe. \"What? Am I on freakin' trial here or something?\" Gabe asks, accepting Tara's hand, and she helps pull him up, and he falls forwards a little bit, that she has to grab him with both arms. He smiles at her, \"Thanks, I'm feeling a little light headed.\" She snorted, \"Yeah, Gabe, I-I'm sure you are.\" Gavin stared at the two of them, \"Watch him like a hawk, Trent. Watch him like a hawk!\" Trent just chuckles, \"Aye, aye, captain.\" Gavin frowns, walking way to the school doors. \"Hey, he can't just leave, we have to talk about what just happened. I was going to tell him-\" Gabe saw Tara's expression, \"You were going to tell him what?\" She asked, studying his face. He stared down at hers, \"Th- that . . .\" he didn't say anything. He just kept staring at her, as she stared back, waiting, \"Well?\" She said. Gabe looked away from her, \"Um, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. It's not like I kissed you because I liked it anyways.\" he replied, \"So are we going to the nurses office, or what?\" She closed her eye, and shook her head, letting go of him sharply and backing away, \"If you are going to be like that, Gabe, than you can take yourself since you're such a big talker, okay. Have fun.\" than she walked away from him, mad. He turned around to watch her go, leaning against the lockers for support. \" S he just walked away without a care in the world for me.\" He murmured, watching her, silently wishing he hadn't said what he did. He put his head back against the locker, \"Crap, what did I do!\" \"You messed up man, you really just messed up.\" Trent said, helping him. \"That's for sure.\" He grumbled, rubbing his temple. Trying to help her out, and than end up actually liking the kis- \"Oh, I think I need a cold ice pack.\" He sighed, closing his eyes, and rubbing his head. \"Sure thing, bro.\" Gabe smiled, \"Thanks man.\" Than he slowly was helped to the nurses office. But the worst thing was it that he knew the nurse couldn't fix the feelings he had begun to have. \"I'm seriously screwed.\", he sighed, as the woman patted his eye with some sort of med thing for his black eye that was starting to show up. \"I can't like it! That is totally messed up!\" He sighed, and laughed to himself, \"You are just dreaming, this is all one weird dream, and you'll wake up.\" But the pain in his eye told him that he already was, just as much as his lips still felt hers. \"Crud!\" The nurse just gave him a weird look, \"You okay kid?\" she asked. He shook his head, \"Yeah, I'm just peachy!\" he said, filling his words with sarcasm. \"Wow, sorry I asked.\" She said, walking out into her office. \"Yeah, me too, lady, me too.\" he muttered, laying back on the nursing bed, his hand gently laid over his head as he groaned, \"Because I thought I didn't even have to ask myself.\"[Chapter 2] Gabe stared up at the big white house with blue shades, he still had the boxes in his hands, just gaping at where he was moving into. \"Wow. . .\" \"Wow is right, you don't even want to know how much they'd spent on this house.\" Gabe's mom says, walking up beside him. He nodded his head as if he agreed, \"Yeah,. . . Probably not!\" He chuckled, staring at her glare. \"What?\" He had just agreed with her, he didn't say about how he thought it absolutely ridiculous of them to pay such things that they could pay for a normal small, nice house in the country, somewhere nice a comfy. Away from stress and worries since they were so rich anyways. Not that he'd want to live in the country, but he knew that was what his mom always talked about. His little sister, nine, came up behind them, \"It's okay.\" She muttered, looking back down at her sketch pad. Gabe mumbled to himself that it was weird that and artist couldn't appreciate the quality of a beautiful house. She glared back at him, \"Gabe, it is not specifically the outer beauty of the house that matters, it is the master piece of the disastrous looking house within itself that captures a true artist heart!\" Gabe laughed, \"Wow, that made about as much sense as the last time you tried to explain it to me.\" He chuckled, thinking he was all-wise, and knew more than his little nine-year old. \"Well, Gabe if you didn't get that, than you probably don't have much of an open mind. True artist express and feel what each other are saying.\" His little brother, five, said, coming to pat Gabe on the back, his big nerdy looking book, that Gabe had no idea about, in his hand beside him. \"Yeah, well, being a true artist does matter, and I know my calling, it's just different from yours, Brainiac.\" he said, smiling, and patting him back on the head. \"Oh yes, that's right. You like the banging the head against the wall, noise to play on your guitar. I forgot, my 'What's your people's proper lingo?' My bad, bro?\" he said, in a professional and grown up tone, even though he still thought that girls were icky. Except for his mom of course. And that monsters still lived under your bed, and Santa Clause was real. Gabe just sighed, \"Whatever. Lets help mom get these boxes to the door. Go, grab some and stop lazing around.\" He ordered. His mom was still staring at him in silence. \"What?\" \"Do you remember whose mom? You maybe the man of the house since your father, but I'm the parent. Got it.\" She says in a stern voice. He rolls his eyes, \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"And stop rolling your eyes at everyone today. I know you don't want to do this, especially on today, of all days. But it will be good for us, all of us!\" She says, going over and hugging him, with one box wrapped around to her hip. He stays quite for a few minutes before saying in a hushed tone, \"It's been almost five years mom, it's fine, just let it go.\" He says, his eyes painful and pleading. She looks at him, \"We need to talk about this sooner or later, Gabe.\" She says, sorrow catching in her voice also, \"It'll be good for us.\" He still pleads, \"Please, mom, just not today. Okay?\" She pauses, and then nods, \"Okay, I understand.\" He gives her a small sad smile. \"More than any of us.\" She shakes her head, \"No, just as much as any of you.\" Than they heard the door open, and out came a beanie loving girl he recognized right away, \"Tara?!\" She came closer to them, and stared wide eyes at Gabe, \"You, your family is the one renting from us for a while?\" He gulped, and slowly nodded, \"I guess so, weird . . .\" His mom could tell there was something wrong, because Gabe wasn't chatting Tara's ear off, and Gabe's mom could tell he liked Tara. This was not like her son. \"So your mom has told me so much about you, and I hear your also on the radio, or something along those lines.\" She smiles sweetly, wishing she'd remembered. \"Oh, yeah, just a small something on the sides.\" Tara says, looking down as if embarrassed. \"Oh, I see, well, Gabe said that you really inspire people to be themselves. It seems he really enjoys your radio station, he listens to it every morning and-\" \"Mom!\" Gabe mumbles loudly, but then smiles. She smiles, \"Oh, sorry, he just said inspirational, and be true to yourself type thing.\" Gabe rubbed his neck, \"So, how's it . . .going?\" She rubbed her shoulder, \"Um, good, um. . .would you all like to come inside?\" Gabe just nodded, and had his mouth clamped shut. 'Man, this is awkward' he thought to himself, walking behind her. \"My mom said to tell you she wouldn't be back till in this afternoon. So she said I should show you where you guys are staying.\" Tara said, almost like she'd been memorizing the words into her head. \"That'd be wonderful, dear!\" Gabe's mom replied with a grin. Gabe felt a bit funny. It wasn't like he liked her. Because he didn't, she was totally not even his type. His types weren't soft or cute, or quite. They were all loud and silly, and sometimes cruel to the quite girl. Just like he, himself. But he just couldn't, for some obvious reasons, not talk. He was speechless, which was a first for him. . . 'This is too weird.' He looked around the nice sized house, and saw the White grand piano. \"Wow, what a beauty!\" He whistled, looking closely at it, and placing his fingers on the keys. He played a little song, and than realized what he was doing, and quickly moved his hand away, smiling wide at them, \"Heh, heh, sorry. . .\" he mumbled, scratching the back of his head, \"Nice piano though.\" He pointed coming over towards her, \"Who is it?\" Tara smiles up at him, \"My dads, he lets everyone play it, so it's okay if you do.\" He looks impressed, and smirks. \"Really, well don't mind if I do.\" than he goes back over at starts to play again. His mom just shakes her head, \"I'm sorry about that, he has always been too spirited and confident for his own good. \" She nods, \"Yeah, but I admire that in people, I'm defiantly not spirited enough.\" Tara says, smiling weakly, and rubbing her head, \"Even after everyone figured out who I was and being Radio Rebel and all. One night I was spirited, than the next, not so much.\" She smiled over at the red head, \"Tara, I think that you are way more spirited than you know. You're just not as loud and obnoxious as my son about it.\" Tara looked over at her in surprise. \"I know he's my son, but that gives me the right to tell you how he is. Gabe's a good kid, but sometimes he can get lost in his own world. Not that he doesn't help or anything. He is the biggest help I know of for me, besides your mom. But he lets the cool factor run his life a little too much sometimes.\" Tara nods as if she understands. And she does, because when she watching Gabe, and how it's like his soul is on the tip of his finger tips while playing, and his whole body is into it too, she knew that to a lot of the kids at their school would say the faces he was making was so uncool, or way to dramatic. But watching him, and hearing him play made her feel inspired. It pulled at her soul in a way she always loved when she listened to great music. She smiled, and then looked back at his mom, \"You maybe right, but he sure knows how to play with his heart on that piano, so I think he still knows who he is, and isn't going to let anyone stop him!\" The blond woman seemed a bit taken back by how confident she sounded when Tara said what she did about Gabe. Smiling back at Tara she replied, \"You know, you're right. He is amazingly soulful when he plays.\" They listened to the rest of his song, and saw him open his eyes half way. He looked surprised to still see them there, \"Oh, you guys didn't need to wait for me.\" He snorted, walking over to them, and picking up his box. \"Lets get going.\" Tara just smiles quietly, \"Okay.\" Gabe looks back at her, and than returns the favor, by a lopsided grin, his green eyes bashful, \"I'm guessing I should let you go first?\" He chuckles, feeling a little awkward as he backs up to let her go first. She puts her head down as she crosses him. \"Yeah, probably.\" She teases softly, showing them to the upstairs rooms which they could all choose from. \"Wow, so I can finally have my own room?!\" Gabe declares in excitement, pumping his fist in the air, \"Took long enough for mom to find a place like this.\" He said, patting his mom on the back. \"Good work, ma!\" Than he turns to the room across from Tara's, and runs inside. \"I call this one! Whoa! It has a bed already in here!\" He shouts like a little boy who got presents early for Christmas. \"Sweet!\" \"Oh course it does.\" Tara says. Gabe hangs his head out the door, and smiles at her, \"Your parents are so cool!\" Tara blushes, \"Yeah, well thanks. . .\" she than turns to Mrs. LaViolet. \"Do you guys need anymore help?\" Gabe's mom smiles, \"No sweetie, thank you, and please call me Rebecca.\" She puts her hand on Tara's shoulder, \"Or Becky for short.\" \"Right, well I'll leave you to moving in, Becky.\" She smiled, and turned to see two little children staring up at her, \"Whoa!\" She yelped, and than she accidentally jumped backwards into Gabe who had come back out to help with moving more boxes. \"Whoa, are you okay?\" he asked, hands wrapped around her waist. He smiled, \"The two little evil twerps scared you, huh?\" She shook her head quickly, pushing herself away from him, \"N-no, they didn't!\" Than she realized she was also calling them twerps, \"They are not twerps I'm sure ,also . . .\" Gabe laughed, \"It's okay, don't worry, they know their brats.\" \"Gabe, that isn't a nice thing to say.\" Tara said, looking up at him with her innocent doe like eyes. He just chuckles, \"I'm not really a nice guy, Tara.\" She gives him a look and walks away, \"Don't I know it.\" He watched her leave with puzzled look written all over his face. Why did he feel disappointed when she believed what he said about himself. It's not like it wasn't true. Later that night Tara smelled something wonderful coming from down stairs, so she shut her book, and got up from her bed. When she got to the kitchen she was surprised. It was Gabe helping cooking with her mom. Or more like he was the one who was doing it all while her mom just watched him. He looked over and saw Tara peeing in, \"Hey, how's it going?\" he said with a nod of his head, and he wiped the towel over his shoulder, and put something like green pepper into the sauce he was cooking. Tara jumped, hid behind the wall, and than walked in, Gabe just smiling quickly at her, \"Um, I'm good, how are you guys?\" she asked, pulling some strand of hair behind her ear. \"Cooking.\" he said, and than went back to concentrating. \"Well, he's cooking my dear, I'm just watching.\" Tara nods, watching his arms, she'd always thought he had normal-ish small arms, but the muscles moving showed her she was wrong. \"Wow, you sure have strong arms don't you?\" she blurted, before realizing how embarrassing it sounded, \"I mean, you just have stronger looking arms than I'd thought. . .\" He stared over at her thinking, \"Are you saying you thought I had puny five-year old arms?\" She blushed again, \"N-no, of course not. . .,Mom, would you like me to help you set up the table?\" she asked, hoping to get out of this conversation. \"No, Gabe already did it.\" she said, looking at her nails, and blowing on them. Gabe turned back to her, one eyebrow raised. \"So you think I have strong arms, huh?\" he smiled slyly with a wink. Tara felt a jolt of shock, \"What, ew! No!\" she stammered, walking quickly away. Gabe smiled and shook his head, looking back at the pot of sauce, as he stirred. He was feeling better after that. \"She's weirdly cute.\" he thinks back to her surprised face. \"But not my type of course. . .because she's my best friends girl . . .\" R&r; if you want. Sorry it took so long. Justanothergirl~ :)[Chapter 3] Gabe sat down next during lunch at school, all his band mates sat next to him, except Gavin,which was pretty obvious why. He rolled his eye at Tara and her boyfriend sat a few tables down. He saw them smiling and laughing, and eating. Gabe smiled as he watched her eat his lunch that he had made her. It speedily disappeared. He had a feeling she liked anything with italian sauce in it, and so far he was right. \"Nice call.\" he said proudly. \"What? What are you talking about G?\" one of his band mates asked, looking up from his food as the others talked. He felt dense as he stared blankly back at his friend, \"Um. . ., nothing important enough to be interested in.\" \"Oh, okay, well did you here that the new movie-.\" Gabe shook his head. What the heck was he watching her for. \"Don't be a creep, G.\" he said to himself, shuddering at his lack of focus he had lost lately. Or more like control on what he wanted to focus on. Like the new music, he had to seriously bring some thunder. They had entered a talent show here at school, it was pretty big. A couple of people in with some agents from big record company's were coming, and the even had the nice cushion y seats, not the crappy kind that squeak and make you uber uncomfortable. He had to get the band ready for new music. And that meant get Gavin to somehow get ready with out Gabe getting killed. Yeah right, like that was going to work. He had kissed his best friends girl. Doesn't get any lower than that unless he had, gag, feelings for Tara. . .which he was starting to. . ., but only in the respectable friendship sort of way. . . Gabe jumped at the hand that patted his back again, \"Wha-?!\" \"At least you weren't looking at her this time you were lost in thought.\" his friend, Gore, said. A light smile showing up on his face. Gabe felt his defences rise once again, \"What? I would never look at Gavin's girlfriend. I mean look at her!\" George just smile, \"Right.\" he said slowly, chuckling and taking a bite of his sandwich. \"Yeah, that's right.\" Gabe said, eyebrows lowered in annoyance. \"Than how did you know I was talking about Tara? It could have been anyone else, dude.\" Gore said, pretending to play the drum roll with his fork and spoon. \"It's cause you like her! Duh.\" he giggled stupidly, his blonde spiky hair sticking up. \"Hey, Gorry, just shut up, alright!\" Gabe hissed, hitting him in the arm. \"Ouch, you know I have a sun tan!\" he squealed, looking about ready to cry. \"Yeah, yeah, whatever cry baby.\" he said, slapping him again. \"OW!\" Gore yelled as all his band mate slapped him also, laughing. \"You guys are such jerks!\" He cried dramatically, standing up, than quickly hitting each one of them with his book binder, running away laughing. \"Gore, you are so dead!\" Trent yelled after him, throwing a plastic spoon towards Gore's head and missing. The band mates all laughed and chuckled, saying \"Stupid Gore.\" \"I'm totally getting him back.\" and \"He is such a dead man!\" Of course this is what the boys did. Teased each other relentlessly, smacking each other, bro fist, and making each other laugh. \"See the new Tomb raider game?\" Trent asked Gabe. Gabe just stared wide-eyed like a little kid, \"Tomb raider? A new one?\" \"Yeah, she not as hot looking, but it actually looks like a pretty good game.\" \"Hm, I'll check it out.\" he grinned, \"It's not even about her body, dude. For me it's all about the action!\" he said with a sheepish smile. \"Yeah, whatever you say, Gabe.\" Trent snickered, causing Gabe to punch him in the shoulder, \"Shudup, Trent.\" \"Grouchy this morning I see.\" Trent said with a smirk. \"Nothing to do with your best bro and band mates girlfriend by any chance?\" \"Huh no. And yes I'm grouchy, back off Trent. \" Gabe , taking another bite of his food, and looking over at Gavin, trying to think of a way to get him to talk to him. \"Okay, just cool down a bit.\" Trent muttered, hands held up, turning towards another one of his band mates. \"It was just a joke.\" Gabe shrugged, \"I guess I just didn't find it that hilarious.\" he said sarcastically, throwing a french fry in his band mates face. Gavin looked around the cafeteria and stopped when he saw Gabe, he waved, and tried to give a friendly smile, which turned a little sour. 'Gavin, even when he's mad, he still tries to be nice. . .' Gabe thought with a sad snort, waving back with a plastered on smile, than looking back down at his sandwich depressed like. He stared at that sandwich for another few seconds, than another seconds, till finally he was just tired of looking at that darn sandwich and threw it over his shoulder, and got up, turning around he walked away from his friends, stepping on the sandwich as he went. ( Note to readers: I really like sandwiches.) \"Gavin, whats wrong?\" Tara asked, looking over at her him. He seemed like he was thinking, he glanced over at her and smiled faintly. \"Nothings wrong. I-I just realized something. . .\" \"That Gabe totally ruined that ham and cheese sandwich!\" Tara proclaimed, somehow knowing the author really like ham and cheese sandwiches! \"Well, yeah, but also that he's been my best friend forever, and he wouldn't just up and hurt me like that, you know?\" Tara nodded, looking at her hands, wondering if she should tell Gavin about Gabe living with her and her parents. She didn't want another scene of him punching Gabe. And she certainly didn't want him always be concerned about them being in the same house together. Would it really benefit him if she said anything? She pushed the thought aside, \"That's true. . .he is a good friend to you.\" she said quietly, putting her hand around his. His smile was strained, \"Yeah, but he still kissed you right in front of me. . .and it was almost like I wasn't jealous that he was kissing you, but like I was jealous of him getting attention. . .which I thought I had dealt with by becoming more open and confident.\" Tara felt surprised, letting go of his hand, \"Wait, you mean you-you weren't jealous of our kiss?\" she asked bluntly, feeling dread grow. \"Why wouldn't you be jealous of someone kissing me?\" He looked over at her as if it just hit him he said the wrong thing, \"No, oh no, no, no! That's not what I meant Tara! You aren't one of those girls, you know, you would never hurt me like that. I didn't like that he kissed you, but I knew you didn't want him to do it either! Oh man, I hope you understand?!\" he said, grabbing her hand, and trying to reassure her by the other hand on her shoulder. She nodded, for some reason not feeling relieved. \"Okay. . .cause for a minute there it kind of sounded like you weren't upset at all that he kissed me. . .\" she replied, stumbling on her words, she hated that, but that was the shy girl in her, she'd better just get use to it. Or at least accept part of it. Being quite wasn't the worst thing in the world. It meant you had to try being a better listener. He sighed, rubbing his eye lids, \"I'm sorry Tara, this is defiantly not the side of me I wanted to show. . .I just hate when I feel like Gabe wins. . .You know how it feels, you've been in my shoes.\" Tara didn't say anything, looking back towards where the ham sandwich was. Afterwords they got up when they were done with lunch. Gavin kissed Tara goodbye, \"Love you.\" she said, as they parted, and felt a little disappointed when she didn't hear it back. But why should she expect that of him so soon. Yet she still felt a certain sense that maybe he was never going to say it. She saw Gabe looking for a drink from the school vending machine they had just recently gotten. She walked quickly towards him, than slowed down once he turned his head to look in her direction. She paused completely a foot away from him. \"Hey.\" he said, leaning down to get his water. She nodded, looking down, than up at him, \"Yeah. . .\" It was silent for a while, \"You need to say somethin' to me or what?\" he asked, leaning against the vending machine, eyeing her. She nodded nervously. \"Yeah, I do.\" \"And what would that be?\" he asked, his eye showing no emotion, his frown showing disinterest. \"Um, I was just wondering,\" she said, stepping closer towards him, \"Why did you. . .ki-ki-\" His eyes were still on hers, she shivered as he stepped closer, his eyes catching hers as he leaned down, \"Why does it matter, I didn't do it for me anyway. I enjoyed nothing from it. It was nothing to me. You,\" his sighed, \"All you are to me is Gavin's girl, and that's how it's going to stay, okay?\" She glared at him, \"And what makes you so sure I wanted you to kiss me. . .\" she said shakily, \"I would never want someone so who is so full of themselves to kiss me. . .\" she said, her voice trembling from being so bold. \"I really wish you had never done it, or Gavin wouldn't be acting so un-confidant.\" Gabe paused at her words. \"You mean he thinks you have feelings for me?\" \"No, I mean he has always been jealous of you, can't you see that. He felt jealous of you getting all the attention!\" she cried, feeling angry, but quieting herself down and blushing. Gabe seemed confused, \"Wait, so he wasn't jealous over his best friend kissing you, but he was jealous over me getting attention. . .?\" Tara nodded, \"Yeah.\" \"That makes no frickin' sense whatsoever.\" he growled, looking intensely annoyed, \"If it were me I'd be jelouse because my girlfriend was kissing another guy, you sure Gavin said that, maybe you just have bad hearing and misheard what he said.\" Tara stood still, \"Yeah, I heard every word, and believe me, I wish he had said it differently. But he said he didn't like you kissing me, so. . .\" Gabe looked like he had an idea, \"Only one way to find out.\" he with a half smile. \"How?\" Tara asked, looking curious. \"Just tell him I kissed you again. . .Than I know he'll face me, and I'll see what I can get to come out of his mouth.\" \"No.\" she said quickly. He groaned, \"Come on, Tara! It's the only thing I can think of!\" \"No! And why would you care so much Gabe. It shouldn't matter to you. The only thing you need to worry about is losing your best friend, so please try to make amends with him.\" She said, grabbing his arm gently with a pleading look, \"Will you just do that, please?\" He stared down at her, amazed that she could be so kind. He saw some of her hair falling from her pony tail, he felt his hand move towards it, and his fingers brush it back behind her ear. He held his hand there, coming closer to her, \"I know that.\" he whispered, his mouth slightly open, close to hers, as his thumb caressed the side of her cheek. \"I just don't know if the other part of me does.\" Tara searches Gabe's green sea eyes, \"Stop.\" she says breathlessly, pulling away from him. As if some sort of spell broke, he came back to reality, and cleared his throat, trying to not make eye contact, \"Sorry.\" than he began to walk away as the bell rang, \"That was really stupid thing to do, it didn't mean anything, forgive me?\" he smiled, grabbing her arm, and making her follow him. \"Or I'll never make you pasta again m'lady.\" he winked, hoping it would hide his feelings which he was beginning to hate. She sighed, smiling, \"Sure. I-I almost thought you were being serious. . .\" 'And I almost wanted you to be. . .' she thought. He rolled his eyes, \"Please, me, serious? Do you even know me woman?\" Tara sighed, \"Right, Gabe, mister cool guy.\" she said, smiling back, wishing her heart would stop pounding so fast at his touch. \"That's right your shyness.\" he teased, bowing. \"the queen of biting her nails, and blushingville.\" \"Whatever.\" she said, smiling. \"You know you have no proven fact. . .\" \"That you blush all the time? Yeah, I do. Every time I come in contact with you, I can see you blushing! Don't worry, a lot of people find that sort of stuff cute.\" She glared at him, and playfully hit him on the arm. \"Hey, Tara!\" a song like voice interrupted their conversation. Tara looked around the class room. It was Audrey, \"Audrey, oh my gosh, what are you doing here! I thought you transferred schools?! It's so good to see you!\" Tara said happily, running over to her friend, and giving her a big hug,\"Oh, it's so good to see you too Tara, I missed you so much! I decided I wouldn't let a boy ruin my life, and decided to come back!\" she said, giving Gabe a look, as she turned her attention back to Tara, \"So, how was the couple of days of school without mawah?!\" Tara sighed, \"Barely survived.\" than smiled. Audrey nodded, \"No doubt I'm sure.\" she replied, giving Gabe another dirty look. Gabe felt confused for about five seconds, \"Wait a second, you told her about what happened? I mean seriously, why would you-\" Gabe backed away from Tara's stare, \"Really Gabe, you do remember you kissed me in front of Gavin and all the kids from school, right?\" Gabe snorted nervously, \"Well, I'm sure not all of them-\" Audrey stepped closer to him, \"Back off my best friend Gabe.\" Gabe didn't understand why Audrey was so protective, but he agreed, \"I'm just going to sit down now. Hope that doesn't offend you.\" he bit back. \"Actually. . .\" Gabe looked surprised, \"Seriously?\" Audrey smiled, \"Yes Gabe, seriously, that is now my chair.\" Gabe got up, \"Fine, I'll just sit here.\" \"Good.\" Audrey smiled, grabbing Tara, and talking secretively to her. Gabe watched them, wishing he could talk some more to Tara. He sighed, and looked around the class room, seeing Gavin, he felt utter guilt. He shouldn't be thinking this way of Tara, he should just focus on the band and his best friend. Tara was just a girl, and unbelievable as it sounded, she was not the only fish in the sea. But she was the only one who had captured his attention so thoroughly. \"Oy Vey, why me?\" He muttered, as his teacher came in, complaining about her car breaking down. Back at home Tara shuffled into her house, as Gabes two sibling rushed in from behind her, \"Hey, Chloë, David, watch out for people, and stop running! Respect the house, and the family around it!\" Gabe called after his youngest siblings, walking out from the kitchen where he had seen them. \"Kay Gabe!\" Chloë yelled from the upstairs, giggling. \"Sorry Tara!\" \"D-don't worry about it!\" , she yelled back, looking over at Gabe and smiled, \"So, are you making something?\" \"Why, you want some?\" he asked slyly. She paused, \"Well, I'm not that hungry, maybe I should just wait till supper is done-\" she got cut of by her stomach growling loudly. She turned a bright shade of crimson. \"Really? Not hungry at all, huh?\" He smirked, \"Come on, I'll make you a snack while you wait.\" She sighed, rubbing her belly, \"You really are trying to make me fat, aren't you Gabe?\" He rolled his eyes, \"How'd you guess.\" She smiled, \"I'm just that good, there is no fooling me Gabe.\" He grabbed her arm and pulled her into the kitchen. \"Here I'll make you something healthy.\" he said as he got Hershey's chocolate out. Seconds later he handed two s'mores on a plate \"Easy and filling, fast, and awesome.\" he said smirking teasingly, as he handed it to her. She thanked him, and took a big bite. \"Hm, so good, you are a life saver!\" she said between bites. He laughed, \"Wow, you really are hungry, huh?\" \"Well,\" she said, looking shyly up at him, \"You did only give me a small bowl of pasta, and apple sticks.\" \"Yeah, sorry about that, girlfriends I've dated said I always make too much food.\" \"Oh, so they don't eat you mean?\" she teased, taking another bite of s'more. He mockingly laughed, \"Ha ha, isn't someone funny. But yes, mostly they didn't.\" he said,enjoying watching her eat. She looked like she felt bad, \"Oh, sorry. . .I-I didn't know. . .\" The smile Gabe gave didn't reach his eyes, \"Yeah, well, me too. I'm glad to see you eat.\" She nodded, feeling awful for what she said, \"Thanks.\" He chuckled, \"You already said that.\" \"Yeah, I mean it though.\" she breather. He put his hand to her chin, whipping off the chocolate and marshmallow. \"It's fine.\" She gazed sweetly towards his face, trying to catch his eyes, as he kept his hand against her face, staring at her lips \" I-I think-\" \"Shh, I hate that word. It's a very frustrating word.\" Gabe murmured, and he meant it as he came closer to her. Thinking about things was stopping him from kissing her again. But now, while he wasn't thinking, he was going to do it. He was going to kiss her while his mind was still not processing what he was fully doing. And as his lips brushed against hers, the doorbell rang. Tara quickly reacted, and backed away, spilling her plate of s'mores, she looked down at the broken plate, and quickly went to the floor with Gabe to pick them up. After they picked up all the pieces she rushed to the door that was now opened, \"Hey, I didn't know what movie we should watch tonight? 'Never been kissed.' Or 'Decoyed bride'?\" Audrey asked, walking in towards her, stopping dead in her tracks at the sight of Gabe, who was right behind Tara. \"What is going on?\" she asked, a little stunned. \"Not what you think!\" Tara replied quickly. \"Really? Than why is Gabe here?\" Gabe just rolled his eyes and walked away, \"Have fun explaining. I'm going up to my room. Later Odd-freak.\" he said, going up the stairs. Tara shook her head, \"Gabe!\" Audrey stopped her, \"It's alright. That's just the way Gabe is. Mean and jerk, nothing more inside that shell.\" Gabe heard her words, but didn't pause. He knew what he said was mean, but at the time his thinking processor was still not fully doing it's job. But his mouth never seemed to fail him. He silently prayed Tara wouldn't think of him the way her best friend did. Than he realized that's exactly what he should want. \"Than why do I feel like such crap!\" he growled, laying down on his bed, and hiding his face with his hands. Tara had watched him leave, knowing he was mad at himself, and knowing she didn't help anything, so she turned to Audrey, \"I'll explain while we watch a movie, okay? Let me make popcorn for us.\" Audrey seemed unsatisfied with this answer, but humbly sat down, and gave her the okay. Than she went into the kitchen, went pass the microwave opened the kitchen window to breathe, this was killing her, she didn't know what to do. A/N: Sorry, I just finished this, so it might not be as great since I did it late at night. I just wanted to get this chapter in. I will be updating more soon. I like this one though, and I hope you all enjoyed it too. Thanks for the reviews, I'm sorry it took me a long time to update. I am really going through some things at this time. Those awesome review people: musiceforeverluver[Chapter 4] Gabe came down stairs, his hair all ruffled up, he hadn't brushed and groomed or anything. It was five in the morning and he needed to start breakfast right away. He paused when he saw Tara in the kitchen stirring up eggs in a bowl, \"What are you doing?\" he asked with a yawn. \"Helping.\" she smiled, as she poured the eggs into the pan, and he heard the sizzling of the eggs beginning to cook. \"You need to turn on the oven fan above, and turn the stove top to medium heat so the eggs don't burn.\" he said, coming over to her, and leaning into her, reaching over for the oven fans knob. Than he snuck his hand around her waist, and turned the heat down to the right temperature. Tara cleared her throat, and felt her cheeks flame up. \"T-thanks. . .\" He moved away from her and got out the bacon and sausage, \"No problem.\" he said smirking as he placed another pan on the burner beside her, and turned on the heat, and waited for it to heat up. He turned his head a little to look over at her, \"So, shouldn't you be in the living room sleeping next to your Bff. Bitch friend forever.\" he mumbled, as he threw some bacon into the skillet. \"Gabe!\" Tara scolded him. \"What?\" he asked casually, looking into her brown eyes jokingly \"I'm not the good guy, it's my type, remember, so I don't have to be nice.\" Tara sighed, and rubbed her forehead, \"Whatever, go ahead and feel sorry for yourself Gabe.\" \"I'm not feeling sorry for myself, it five in the morning, and you're burning the eggs.\" he said calmly, as Tara jumped in surprise, and turned the burner off, and set the eggs quickly on to the plate beside her on the table. \"Ouch!\" she shouted, putting the pan down, and running over to the sink. Gabe paused, than turned off the burner and came racing over to her as she turned on the cold water. \"Put it under!\" he said , and he helped her by grabbing her hands and putting them under the cool water. He studied her hands as he held them. \"I'm going to make you a paste for this, okay, but for now keep it under the water.\" \"A paste?\" she asked, confused. \"To take away some of the pain of the burn.\" he said, grabbing baking soda out of one of the cupboards and a small bowl. \"Since you guys have no burn cream in this house, I'll just have to make some.\" \"Out of baking soda?\" she asked, as he put some water in the bowl, than poured the soda in. \"Yes, baking soda.\" he replied, stirring it in, his face in a genuine look of concern, something she had never seen on him before. \"Thanks.\" She smiled, as he lifted her hands, and dabbed it on the spot were it had the red burns. \"Not a problem.\" he said, grabbing a few band aids. \"No, really, this is sweet.\" she said, as he than pulled apart the wrappings and put it on her. \"As in a friend way, of course!\" she quickly stated after, a hint of understanding that she might seem flirty. \"You're fine.\" Gabe said, as he went oven to the skillet to turn over the bacon. Tara chuckled, and went over to him, \"Now you're being the forgetful one.\" she said, turning back on the burner. \"Whatever.\" he chuckled, turning it to medium heat. \"Um, Gabe.\" Tara said softly, almost so softly that Gabe didn't hear her. \"Yeah?\" \"About what happened yesterday, when we almost. . .you know. . .\" \"Yeah. It won't happen again, don't worry.\" Gabe tried to assure her, as he put on some more bacon strips. \"Oh, good, It's just that we barely know each other. . .I mean we are getting to know each other. . .as friends right?\" she asked, trying to make over easy eggs, but failing. He nodded, watching her mess up, not able to help cracking a smile, \"Yeah, of course. By the way, you really suck at making eggs.\" She glared at him, \"I didn't do it that bad!\" \"Yes, yes you did!\" he laughed, but gave her a little pat on her shoulder, \"Hey, you know, some people were meant to suck so that they could make other people feel better about themselves. You seems to be helping me feel better already shy one.\" he teased, getting another glare from her. \"Shut it Gabe.\" \"Ooh, look whose talking back now.\" he joked, but shut up when he saw her trying to flip one. \"Wow, you really do suck at this. Okay, look, this is what you do.\" he said, coming over to her, and helping her, telling her to wait for a few seconds before she flipped them. Once she started getting it, she became an over easy egg master! \"Thanks Gabe, you are so good at these things!\" she said in amazment He just snickered, \"Yeah, if you ever need a Manny, just give me a call, like that isn't sissy enough or anything.\" \"It's not!\" Tara stated, eyes darting to his, \"It's really hard, and only gets easier with time because you teach someone, and help them understand. Some people never get good at doing these things if they're not taught them.\" \"Right, so than why was I always so good at figuring it out on my own than, huh?\" he asked, turning the bacon over. Tara looked at him surprise showing on her face, \"What do you mean? You mean no one taught you?\" \"Nope, pretty much had to learn from reading a cook book when I was ten. And it took me a while, I had to look up what some of the words meant, I wasn't to sharp in the reading department either, so I started with the basics, eggs, bacon, pancakes.\" Tara nodded, \"But pancakes are harder.\" \"Not if it comes in a box, and all you have to do it add water.\" he said with a knowing smile. \"Believe me, measuring was not my strong point either, so the pancakes always came out a little weird.\" \"Why didn't-\" Tara started, but than Gabe finished for her, \"Why didn't my mom help out? Because, she had to find work to support us, she'd get up early in the morning, so early, that when I realized, I started getting up to make breakfast even earlier so she could have some food and rush off.\" She just supposed that the school would feed us, she didn't realize that we couldn't pay for it any more, so I always made sure to prepare lunches before breakfast also, and than have all the ingredients set out for supper so I could make it right when I got home.\" \"I know this might be too personal, but what about your dad?\" she asked, flipping over some more eggs. Gabe looked down at the sausage he was cooking over the stove, and scratched his head, the painful memories coming back. \"He was drafted into the army when my brother was born.\" Tara grew still, but turned her head towards him, \"What happened to him?\" Gabe silently took the sausages out, and put them beside the rest of the food on the plate. \"I'll make the pancakes, do you want some pancakes with blueberry's?\" he asked, the emotion in his voice begging for her to change the conversation. \"Y-yes, of course, I think blueberries sound great. Thank you.\" she said, her heart breaking for the boy who had waited for a dad who probably never returned. \"What else should I do?\" she asked, trying to help shift the conversation. \"Set out the plates, and silver ware, and cups.\" he said, not looking at her, and she almost thought he was about to cry, his face seemed pained by haunted memories of growing up without a dad. \"Okay, I will.\" she said quietly, and went and rubbed his shoulder gently before heading to the cupboards to get the plates. He cleared his throat a few times, before pouring flour, sugar, butter, and other things to make pancakes. Than he went and washed out the skillet, and after washing and drying it, he put it back on the burner, sprayed it with cooking spray, and poured some of the batter with blueberries in for the first pancake, \"Great,\" he said to himself. \"Now to get out the orange juice.\" he went over to the fridge and paused, took the necklace hiding under his shirt, and looked at the banged up war tags of Samuel LaViolet. He held them tightly, and than put them gently between his chest, and the white material shirt, hiding it from the eyes of Tara. He opened the fridge, and got out the milk and orange juice, and set them down on the counter. At school: Gabe rushed to Gavin when he saw him enter the school halls, \"Hey, Gavin, man, we need to talk!\" Gabe said, trying to grab him by the shoulder like all the other times he had in the past. But Gavin shrugged him off, \"About what Gabe? How you have the hots for my girlfriend?\" Gabe was a little taken back by that, \"What?! No! Stop being a dick for a minute a listen to me man!\" Gavin laughed, \"That's funny, cause I'm sure you did not just call me the dick?\" Gabe sighed, this was getting worse by the seconds, and they had only just started to talk, \"Look, dude, I don't have the hot's for Tara.\" lie, all lies, total lies, but what else was he going to say, 'Oh, yeah, I think I might have more than the hots for your girlfriend, and that I've even tried to kiss her a few times, but hey, can't we still be bestest of bud, and play in the band still together so we don't get kicked out?!' Yeah, maybe in a fantasy world, but this was reality. \"And honestly, I was only helping her from not getting her heart broken by you say you didn't feel the same about her.\" Gavin paused at that, and turned towards him, \"And how would you know how I feel? I mean yeah, I might not like Tara in that way, but Gabe, I know I could someday, and that's all that really matters.\" Gabe shook his head, \"Dude, and what if it doesn't? What if you stay with her, and end up taking her for granted? Maybe she deserves more than that, don't you think?\" Gavin gave him a look, almost like he seemed intimated by Gabe, nah, that must just be his imagination. . . \"And you think you are what she deserves or something?\" he asked, crossing his arms. Whoa, who took Gavin, and replace him with this jerk? Didn't he know Gabe didn't think that he deserved anything like that? \"No, I don't. I think she deserves someone better than either of us.\" he said, feeling himself break a little at that. \"Really.\" Gavin said, eyeing him, the hatred had gone out of his voice, and his look turned more curious than anything, \"Gabe,. . . do you . . .have feelings for Tara?\" he asked, his face turning some what sympathetic. Gabe felt dumbfounded. Did Gavin actually figure him out already. No, he couldn't have. But the grin that suddenly appeared on his best friends face confirmed it. Gabe suddenly felt annoyed, \"Gavin, piss off.\" he growled, \"Why does it matter how I feel.\" Gavin followed behind Gabe quickly, \"Because, that means you . . .you actually like her. I've never seen you like someone like this in my life. And I grew up with you. And now that I think about it, she's the only girl you've actually tried to avoid.\" \"No, not true, I've avoided Ashley Grossman. Darlene Kingston-\" \"Because they all have strong athletic boyfriends. And yet you kissed her so I'd feel jealous, and punch you. Wait a minute, exactly how long have you had a thing for her?\" he asked, grabbing Gabe, and turning him towards him. \"None of your damn business.\" Gabe hissed, pushing him off. Gabe stalked away, angry that Gavin was trying to figure him out, like he actually cared about him having feelings for Tara. Gabe went outside the school doors to get some fresh air. He paused, taking in the first moment he met Tara. Eight years in the past: Gabe sat on the side walk of his house crying, wondering why his daddy had to leave! Why couldn't it be someone else's daddy! Not his! Why was the president doing this to his daddy? And to his mommy, sister, and his soon to be born brother! Why did he suddenly feel so alone! He heard someone coming up beside him, and looked up, and saw a little girl, with a red lollipop in her hand, that she had licked, staring down at him. She realized he was crying and sat down beside him, an took something out of her pocket. It was a green lollipop with the wrapper still over it. He looked into the big brown doe eyes, and sniffled, rubbing off the tears from his cheeks with his sleeve, and than took the lollipop from her. \"Thanks.\" he said. She sat silently by him, and smiled a warm sweet smile, \"No problem.\" He took off the wrapper, and sucked it, while watching her tell him stories with her big purple beanie, and than she listened to him talk. And she listened to him about his daddy, and he started crying again. She grabbed him into a hug. Usually he thought girls were gross when they hugged him, but something about her kindness and warmth made him like her. After a while of her comforting him, and talking to him, her mommy came over in a panic, \"Tara, where have you been, I've been so worried!\" Tara's mom said, grabbing her and hugging her. \" I was talking to this boy!\" little Tara said, pointing back at the startled Gabe. He stood up, \"H-hello.\" Tara's mommy smiled at him, \"Hello, so my daughter has made a friend, huh?\" \" Yeah, and he and I ate lollipops together!\" Tara giggled, \"And we talked about dragons and fairy's, and a secret between us two!\" She said, giving Gabe a silly wink that only little girls could get away with at their age. He smiled at her, feeling a bit better, \"Our little secret.\" they agreed and shook on it. Than after their parents talked, Tara went away, but before she went, she told him this, \"My mommy told me, Remembering is how to hold someone in your heart forever, even when they're not there, so when your daddy is away, always remember him and he will forever be in your heart with you, even when he's gone.\" Gabe had nodded, starting to tear up again, and hugged her, \"Someday, you and I are going to be together, don't go date no other boy, or give him a lollipop ever, just me, okay?!\" Tara agreed and hugged him back. \"I won't give anyone else a lollipop except you, okay!\" \" Good!\" Gabe had remembered saying, as his parents and her's watched, cooing on how cute they were. Gabe sighed, had it really been eight years when that had happened. \"Well, looks like she kept one of her promises, she hasn't given a lollipop to any boys that I've seen. . .\" than he said, laughing as he turns back to head inside for his next class. And it wasn't as though he had expected her to wait for him. They were both nine at the time, and were too young to know what they wanted. Than he saw her at school, she had turned shy, and nervous. He had turned bold, and popular. So he let the promise they had made go, but never forgot it. Ever. Once he came back in Gavin was still standing beside the door, leaning against a locker waiting for him. \"So. . .Do you?\" Gabe rolled his eyes and groaned, \"Why would it matter, she's your girl and she loves you more than anyone.\" Gavin shrugged his shoulders, \"I was just wondering, anything wrong with wondering if my best friend is in love with my girlfriend?\" He gulped. He hadn't thought that far yet. He was actually trying not to think that far, especially since she was in love with someone else. This was getting way out of hand for even him. \"No, now leave me alone, dude.\" He knew He was suppose to talk to Gavin about that band, and our audition, but the way Gavin was asking him about Tara was making him mad, like he wanted to know if Gabe would take her away or something. But Gavin was always the good one, he never wanted anyone to be hurt. So that couldn't be it. \"Actually, I have a question, why are you asking?\" He eyed Gavin curiously. Gavin looked guilty, \"Because. . .\" he sighed, \"I don't think I'll ever feel that way about her. . .and it's killing me man, because she just so sweet, and kind, and what I've always thought was the girl I wanted, but than. . .\" Gabe felt like hitting him, like literally hitting him. 'He had better not be thinking about breaking Tara's heart or he was a dead man, a D-E-A-D MAN!' He thought coming closer to him, the glare he gave was burning Gavin. \"Okay, calm down, I know, I know. What's going on in my head right now is not cool at all, is jerky, and kind of what Gabe would do, not Gavin. But come on, I'm not perfect, I see other girls who want to be with me, and I want to be with them also. And I can't take how I'm hating myself so much over this, and I think. . .I think I need to break up with Tara, because I just don't know what to do any more. I'm not into her, and she doesn't want to do more than kiss, and I just need more! I don't want her any more, and coul-\" That's right. Gabe punched him. Right in the nose, and than in the eye and a few other times before people tore them apart. Gabe had to walk away again and cool down once more. 'What an ass!\" Gabe had always thought that Gavin was so cool, and nice. He always had peoples backs, but the ugliness that just came out of his mouth made Gabe cringe in anger. Gabe would have killed him, if someone hadn't pulled him away. \"I can't believe the dick!\" He couldn't believe anyone couldn't be able to be hundred percent in love with Tara. She was beautiful, her features, and her heart were a hundred percent beautiful! What idiot would screw up that chance?! Heartbroken: Tara was crying, she had heard all of what Gavin had said. She felt her heart stop. Why did she think he would want to be with someone like her, who hadn't even give herself to him, and had only let it go to kissing. What did she think was going to happen? She than saw Gabe throw himself onto Gavin, and start punching him, and punching him, once after another. Than everyone went over to watch as the principal and teachers pulled them apart. Gabe was like a loose wild animal, he glared at Gavin, and shrugged off the teachers hands, and followed the principal to his office. She watched as he came back out, he had a note, and a detention slip in his hand. Tara came up towards him, \"Gabe, are you okay?\" she asked shakily, checking the blood coming from his lip. He nodded, and told her he was going to the nurse, but than, as he was heading that way, he paused, and turned back to her, \"You deserve better, you know.\" he said, softly looking over at her. She nodded, tears stinging her eyes, \"Here, I'll help you to the nurse. \"No, I'll be fine, you go and find Audrey. I need some time by myself.\" She understood, \"Okay, thank you. . .And please don't ever do anything like that again, or I'll worry to much about you.\" than she ran off with Gabe watching her, he felt defeated. He hadn't seen her until he was walking with the principal to his office, he had paused, and seen in her eyes that she had overheard everything. He was pushed forward gently by one of the teachers, as he had stared away, and went inside. Audrey was surprised, \"Wait, so Gabe stood up for you?! What? Gabe, the boy who only cares about himself?\" Tara nodded, \"He cares about more than himself, Audrey, he sometimes doesn't know how to show it.\" she says, tears starting to fall from her eyes to her cheeks. \"I can't believe I thought Gavin would want to be with me. I mean look at me!\" she said, her dark blue beanie on her head, and her tee shirt and vest and regular jeans were not like all the other girls who wore short shorts, and revealing tops. She was just normal, boring, Tara, who would ever want her? Audrey shook her head, \"Believe me, you are beautiful girl, an any idiot who doesn't see that needs to get their eyes checked, and so what, you don't dress like a hoe, good for you! Am I right darling?!\" Tara tried to smile at that. \"Yeah, sure.\" \"It seems Gabe thinks you're beautiful enough, he fought for you.\" she said, trying to cheer Tara up. \"Yeah, but that's just because he felt bad for pathetic old shy girl, Tara.\" she grumbled. \"Really, I don't think so. I've seen the way he looks at you like you are the only girl in the room.\" \"Whatever.\" Tara chuckled, not believing her. \"What, it's true, he does!\" she said, \"I mean you've seen how he looks at you right? Why do you think I told him to leave you alone.\" Tara felt her heart beat race a little, and a red hue showed up on her face, \"No, you're wrong, Gabe and I agreed we wanted to be friends, nothing more.\" \"Okay, doesn't mean he's still not a boy, and you're still not a girl, does it.\" Tara sighed, still feeling depressed over Gavin, \"Well, you might be right, but Gabe is my friend, and I don't think he wants to be more than that, and also I'm not exactly ready for that when I overheard my now ex boyfriend wanted to break up with me. It's going to take me time to get over this, and- and\" she started crying once more. \"So than just use Gabe as a rebound!\" Audrey said quickly, trying to help her think of something else to not make her cry. \"What? No! I'm not going to do that!\" Tara said angrily, getting up off the park bench she'd been sitting on, \"I need to go home now. I'll talk to you later.\" \"Okay, I'm here if you need me!\" Audrey said in worry. \"Yeah, okay\" Tara replied quickly leaving. She couldn't do this any more. Gabe was physically hurt. Gavin hurt her emotionally. Her friend barely understood anything she was going through, and didn't realize she just need someone to listen, and be there for her, not tell her how to make it all better by hurting Gabe. This day was turning into the worst day so far. Once she got home she was so relieved to see Gabe cooking. \"You're home.\" Gabe said, staring over at her, look of concern washed over him. He was dressed in his white shirt and blue checkered long john bottoms, leaning over the counter, waiting for her. She nodded, feeling about ready to cry. He was here, and he was ready to listen, and that meant a lot to her. \"Yeah.\" \"Wanna talk? Or just watch some cartoons, and eat junk food?\" he asked, as he sat the spaghetti plates on the counter. \"Cartoons please!\" she said quickly. He nodded and smiled warmly, \"Okay, get you Pj's ready than. She ran upstairs, and put on her read top, and grey sweat pants, than ran quickly back down. \"Only two plates?\" she asked curiously, coming back into the kitchen. \"Yeah, well, your parents and my mom just left to go to a movie. I already feed the two demon children a while ago, so I thought I'd wait till you got home to eat with you.\" he said simply, getting out some sodas, and chips. She looked over at the clock, \"Wow! I was really gone till seven?\" \"Times flys, huh.\" he said, handing her a plate with spaghetti and fork, \"Lets go watch something, and eat, okay?\" She nodded, trying hard to not ball her eyes out. \"Oh, and don't hold those water works in. I hear your head will explode if you don't let it out or something.\" he teased, putting his arm around her, and rubbing her shoulder gently. Tara laughed, and than cried as they went into the living room. \"Now what would you like to watch first? Scooby doo, or 101 Dalmatians?\" he asked, picking them up to show her as she sat on the couch, wrapping a blanket around herself, \"I-I liked to watch Scooby please.\" she sniffled, \"And is there any chocolate turtles left?\" Gabe nodded, putting in the movie. \"Yep, still can't believe you barbarians put turtles in chocolate, disgusting people!\" Tara smiled. Knowing Gabe was trying to cheer her up made it feel like everything might be alright after all. \"Thank you m'lord!\" she said as he handed her the chocolate turtles, and her soda and chips. \"Why you are welcome m'lady.\" he teased, bowing, than sitting down beside her and eating his supper as Scooby doo came on the screen. \"Thank you.\" she said again, staring over at him truly thankful for him. He looked back at her, and squeezed her hand, hoping to help make it all better, \"Not a word of this to the devil children, don't want them to know I'm actually an okay guy!\" he said, and she laughed, and agreed, of course teasing him back. And after two hours of scooby doo shows, and her bawling in his arms, their parents came in, and found them asleep, holding onto one another on the sofa. And they cooed about how cute the two looked beside each other. Parents, yesh! A/N: Oh my goodness it's been a while, I feel so bad about not posting this sooner! I promised and everything! Please forgive this mean author! pretty please! Reviewers: AmandaSimmons95: Thank you for being so patience the other time,lol, I hope this is another long-ish chapter, and I hope you like it once more, cause I enjoyed writing it! Bethanforever: Those people are probably the same people who wouldn't get why I ship Ryder and Unique on Glee, they just can't see the beauty they could become! Lol, Tara doesn't like bad boys, she is just really nice to the point where she'd even offer a bagel toasted, and creamed cheese to someone before they would kill her, lol. Maybe she's a little too nice to people, but oh well, lol! Audrey is being kind of judgemental, but that's just because she doesn't trust him, and thinks Tara can't stick up for herself, but she seems to be warming up to him a little in this chapter for sticking up for her Bff , Bitch friends forever like Gabe would say. Oh honey, Gabe has been telling Tara he loves her, with his eyes for a while now, LOL. ;) Jk, don't worry, it'll happen sooner, rather than later, and in words. Amsparz: Of course I did, I eventually will do, lol! Takes some time cause I'm awful a typing. I miss some words someties. See. ;) I don't feel too bad for Gavin right now, sorry. But I'm still getting him together with someone. Taini: I am, no worries, lol. I do have a chapter two and three though also. This will be chappie four! YAY, hope you love it like I love Tara and Gabe3! :D Love, Justanothergirl~[Chapter 5] Gabe woke up, and felt something laying on his chest. He looked down to see it was a person with red hair in a messy buns head there, her eyelashes were longer than what he remembered, and her face looked peaceful as she breathed softly in and out, her hand was on the middle of his stomach. When did he suddenly fall asleep next to an angel? He smiled sleepily, and started to close his eyes gingerly, than they snapped back open, and he looked back down at said angel, \"Tara?\" He whispered, looking horrified, than quickly, yet quietly tried to get up, and run to his room, but tripped over the coffee table before he could. \"Ouch!\" he hissed, and heard Tara stirring. \"Crap, crap, crap!\" he whispered furiously, as he raced up stairs. She moaned softly, and looked over beside the coffee table. She swore she'd heard someone. Gabe softly walked up to his room, and shut the door behind him, laying his head against the door. Great, so now he was turning into a mushy mess over her now too? This had to stop! \"I'm seriously losing it. . .\" He growled, hand running through his tousled hair. \"Great.\" ~A new love to bloom.~ Tara stretched out her legs and arms, and sat up on the couch, she looked around the living room, and got up, stretching once again and yawning, Gabe chose that moment to enter. He avoided eye contact as he headed into the kitchen. Tara watched him leave, arms stretched up in the air when she realized her tummy was showing. She quickly pulled it down, and ran upstairs to change. Back down stairs Gabe started the food. This was getting kind of weird. It felt like there was no big elephant in the room anymore. Gavin? Was Gavin that humongous, annoying, asshole of an elephant? The big elephant that had made him stop from a lot of things he had wanted to say, and do? Mostly say. It was hard for him not to blab. Blabbing was his thing, he was good at it, unless of course he was limited. \"Hey, what you making?\" Tara asked, coming in and pulling her hair back into a pony tail, staring over towards him, and smiled sweetly. He looked down, trying to avoid eye contact, \"Nothing, foods ready.\" he glanced over at her as she got herself a cup of orange juice and sat down. He turned as he heard everyone else rushing in. \"Hey, Tara, will you come to the station later, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.\" her step dad said, sitting down at the head of the table, \"Got my food son?\" he asked Gabe in a friendly voice, smiling as he came to give him food. \"Thank you, you should become a chief someday.\" \"Nah, the only person I'll be a chief to is my wife, unless she likes cooking, than that's fine too.\" he said causally, as if he'd thought it plenty of time before. He paused, and laughed stiffly, \"But I will consider it, chefs do get paid a lot, but I'm pretty sure I'll just stick with music.\" he smirked, winking at Tara, who smiled back at him, and kept on eating her breakfast. \"Thank you for everything.\" she said, looking at him with very touched features, and he had a feeling she meant more than just the food. \"Yeah, sure, no problem.\" he said, feeling a little nervous as he went to put the eggs away. \"Hey, why are your eyes so puffy?\" asked Chloë, who was sitting next to Tara. \"No reason sweetie, must just be allergies.\" Tara stated, smiling at the girl. \"So, why did you and Gabe sleep on the same couch all night together like a married couple. I swore you'd get cooties by sleeping near a boy for that long, and knowing my big bro, he'd totally make moves on you! Boys are gross. Hey, don't steal my bacon!\" she yelled, aiming for her brother's arm. But Gabe was too quick and put some of it in his mouth, crunching it, \"Later.\" he said, hurrying out the door, swinging his back pack on. \"Anyway, I should have drawn you two, the way you laid beside each other-.\" her mothers look made her stop her sentence entirely. Tara was almost as red as her deep red hair. \"Wait, Gabe, you barely ate any breakfast!\" his mother shouted after him. That made him stop and come back in, grabbing another two slices of bacon, and coming over to his mom. \"Not that hungry!\" Gabe said quickly, kissing his mom on the forehead, and was out the door in seconds. His mother looked perplexed, \"Gabe's alway hungry though. . .\" Tara just shrugged her shoulders. \"Maybe he's not feeling so well? I'll go with him.\" Tara said, standing up, and drinking the rest of her orange juice. \"Bye mom, bye dad. Bye Mrs. Becky.\" she had to at least have Mrs. in there somewhere, it just felt to weird calling her Becky. \"Bye Miss Tara.\" Gabe's mom said, grinning back at her all-knowing. This just confused Tara as she went out to find Gabe. Gabe was walking slowly down to the block. \" Wait up!\" Tara yelled after him, she ran towards him. He looked back at her blankly, \"Uh, yeah? What is it?\" Tara was a little taken back by this, \"N-nothing, I was just wondering where your going, it is Saturday after all.\" He nodded, smirking, and scratching the back of his head nervously, \"Oh, well I'm just going down to the music store to get some new guitar strings. I don't suppose you'd actually want to come with me, would you?\" Tara smiled back, \"Sure, off on an adventure!-\" \" Yeah, yeah, it's not that big a deal. I just really need new strings ever month or so to keep in tune.\" \" Really? That's awesome, I've never really played guitar that much. I mean, I've tried, but I never knew about keeping the guitar in tune.\" \" What, so you are just letting that poor thing sit up there untouched, you animal!\" Gabe teased, \"Come on, will find something for it, what kind of guitar do you have?\" he asked. \" Oh, I think it's a Gibson acoustic guitar. It's really a very nice dark shade.\" \" Hm, really? Well, It's not as much about the color as the sound it can make, and the way it's shaped. Gibson acoustic guitars are always the best for beginners. You need to practice everyday for at least an hour or two if you want to play a nice song or two around the campfire.\" Tara eyed him, \"What if I wanted to be a professional like yourself?\" He grinned, and pinched her cheeks like she was four, \"Than you'd have to practice all night and day, any chance you get of free time.\" \" Yeah, I guess I know that since I hear you playing late every night.\" \" Yeah, well, I like playing.\" \" I heard some songs I've never heard on the radio that you played. I even looked it up online. So, did you write it yourself?\" Gabe suddenly became flushed, and scrunched up his shoulders as if to pretending he needed warmth\"Yeah *Clears throat* , I did.\" \" Wow, you are pretty good at making music, huh.\" she smiled, eyes glancing over at him at the same time he glanced at her. Gabe looked away, and rubbed the tip of his nose awkwardly, \"Kind of. . .\" \" You are, I mean, I've never heard someone besides Gavi-\" she stopped talking, and looked away not wanting to think about that person who had stomped on her heart, stomped, and it didn't seem he'd ever stop. \" Don't think about that douche bag, Tara. That asshole is not worth your loyalty or love.\" Gabe growled, just getting angry thinking about it. Tara felt a sudden rush of guilt, \"Wait, Gabe, don't be mad at him just because of me. I'm not worth giving up your friendship. He is way more important!\" Gabe snorted, looking at her surprised, \"Nope.\" Gabe stopped in the middle of their walk, as they were almost there, Tara turned and looked confused, \"Did you forget something?\" \" No, just don't you ever say that about yourself again.\" Gabe said, taking her hand and squeezing it, \"You are more important than you know. And Gavin was a jerk, so I don't really want to deal with him now. I'm not saying I don't care about him, but I care about you more.\" He said softly, yet strongly. His eyes never tearing off hers. She blinked a couple of times dumbfounded, \"O-oh.\" \" Yeah, oh.\" Gabe whispered, coming closer, his head inching closer to hers, his forehead, if leaned more, would gently rest on hers. Tara shivered by the way his eyes locked with hers. \"Oh.\" was all she could say, she didn't really understand, but she couldn't say anything else. \" Yeah, oh.\" He said with a sincere look Tara was shocked about, than he pulled away, and gave a small smirk, \"Heh, guess we should get going?\" he cursed himself under his breath once he got further away. Tara nodded, her face burning and looking down shyly, she had to fan herself with her hand as she walked behind him, and took a deep breath. She was about to open her eyes when she got hit by something speeding her way, making her fall to the ground. \"Ouch!\" she groaned. \" Oops, sorry 'bout that.\" said a voice, coming over to her, helping her off the ground. Tara tried to help him feel better, \"It's-it's okay. . .\" She looked up at the handsome brown hazel eyes, and the dashing grin, his light blond hair cut perfectly in the right sides of the shape of his head. Tara gulped, \"Are you sure miss?\" he asked her with a grin. Gabe was already by her side by than, \"Whoa, are you alright?\" he asked, grabbing her, concern in his voice, \"You really got hit there, m'lady!\"he said, trying to comfort her. He softly caressed the side of her forehead, close to her eyebrow where there was a medium-sized bump, \"Damn.\" he muttered, than stared into her eyes. She was staring back, hazily eyed at him, her heart warmed by his concern that she completely forgot about everything else that was going on around them, and just stared back and forth between his eyes and his lips, and his, wonderfully, beautiful, green eyes. . . 'Holy moly, what is going on with me?' she thought, her eyes growing wide as Gabe's hand slid down to her chin, tingels running like electricity through them, and his thumb rubbing against her lower jaw line, his green eyes growing softer as he felt the moment become theirs, her breathing became a bit shallow as she came closer to him, and lifted her hand to his, and to his sleeve, she gently tugged on it. Than she snapped out of it, and backed away from him, clearing her throat, her heart still throbbing rapidly. \" Okay, seems like I just interrupted something, so I'll just leave. . .\" said the blond boy about their age. \" No!\" she said quickly, grabbing his arm. This was bad, what if she attacked Gabe with reboundness, no matter how different it felt from Gavin's touch, and how much more she was breathless by his touch, and eyes,and- No this had to stop, this was crazy, this was Gabe, he was her friend. . .she just was getting over Gavin, she could not go through this. The blond boy just looked at her like she was crazy, \"What do you mean? You aren't gonna sue me are you?\" the fear in his eyes shown through, \"Please, don't sue me, here, take my bike! I didn't mean it, I swear!\" Tara quickly reassured him, \"Oh, no, no, I just. . .she looked between the guy and Gabe, and suddenly felt like laughing. Gabe was this confident guy who would never be a cry baby over a girl saying she'd sue him, he'd probably tell her to go ahead, and see how he'd get her back, and make a whole ridiculous story to make her back out, and this guy was begging for freedom. This guy was half the size of Gabe, and he was such a coward. \" I just wanted to assure you I am perfectly fine.\" she smiled, patting his back and walking away from the guy. Gabe watched her go, and looked back at the blonde, \"Hey, wheely, just know I got eyes everywhere, and they can all be watchin' you.\" Gabe said,coming over and slapping the guy on the back \"Understand that I can not be sure what those eyes can and cannot do, you have been warned.\" he said, glaring over at Blodie, \"Later, Goldie locks.\" Than as he walked away and heard the nervous squeal of the guy behind him, he chuckled. \" Hey, wait up!\" he said after her, running and grabbing her arm, \"You really okay?\" She nodded, \"Yep. . .\" she smiled at him, \"You really do have an amazing smile.\" she said,bringing her fingers lightly to his lips, touching them to her finger tips. She gazed back up at him, coming closer to him, and almost so close to him that he could smell coconut shampoo wafer off her, he slit his eyes, and looked into her big brown ones glazing over, \"I-I . . .I\" than she was closely reaching his mouth, moving her hands to the back of his neck, \"Gabe\" she murmured, practically locking lips with his. . . Than fell forward on him. He snapped out of his trance, and blinked a couple of time, \"Tara?\" he winced, and he realized she was passed out in his arms. He lifted her up and laid her on a park bench, combing her hair out of her face. \"Does this mean we can't get my guitar strings?\" he asked, seeing if maybe she was just in shock and still awake. Than he felt true horror, what if she was in a coma, \"Tara, wake up, wake up!\" he urged, lightly slapping her cheeks, and helping her sit. She groggily opened her eyes, \"Gabe,. . .my head hurts. . .\" \" I know, just stay awake, I'm here. I'll call your parents and see if they can pick us up!\" he said, doing his best to keep her awake and in the same time dialing home. A few minutes later she awoke in a hospital bed, she looked around groggily, she saw her parents, \"What's going on?\" The instant Gabe heard her voice, he sat straight up out of the hunched over position he was sitting in. \" Oh Tara, Honey! We were so scared!\" he mother said, coming over and hugging her tightly, \"Oh my, if Gabe hadn't been with you I don't know what might have happened?!\" her mother cried, sobbing into her daughter's shoulder. \" Tara.\" her dad said, holding his daughter in his arms, as he tried not to cry, \"We-we thought you'd. . .\" \" Wait, what do you mean?\" she asked, looking over at Gabe. \" Well, you hit your head at a certain place. . .and. . .\" Gabe felt his knees go weak, just like on the day when his dad. . . He came over to her slowly, and sank to her bed, \"You okay?\" he asked shakily looking up at her. Her dark eyes studied him curiously, \"Yeah, I am. . .\" \" What?\" he asked, holding her hand, \"Is something wrong?\" \" No. . .\" she replied, looking down at his hand, than back at him looking confused, \"I just don't think I remember you. Who are you again?\" Gabe felt a string of shock go through him, \"You. . .don't remember me?\" She shook her head, \"No, should I?\" Than she moved her hand away from his grasp, and looked at her parents in worry , \"Where is Gavin?\" A/n: This is most likely a short chapter again, but I trying, lol! I like this chapter, but there are somethings I'll probably add to it to make it more detailed later. For now this is thee chapter I'm posting! Yay! :) Amsparz: Yeah, know he is, but I think for him, he's just trying to figure himself out more, and in that time he was only thinking of him. It can happen to anyone, but yes, he is an a-hole, lol. TheAmazingNorwegian: You guys are so loyal, I feel I kinda messed up on this chapter, but I still like it, it just needs a little more detail and longer. I will be trying, just busy living life as it goes. Bethanforever: Yep, Gabe's dad was in war, did he die there? You will find out soon. I was wondering if others would not like Gavin so much after this chapter. Gavin in my story does still feel bad that he never cared enough, but he's still an ass for what he said. We all can be, lol. Poor Tara is right, she awfully nice. She can't help it, lol. I sometimes want her to punch someone, but maybe I'll do that later, lol! I'm going to try to update sooner, I really bad at that, so I'll try harder, but know this, I'm not a giver upper, lol! I try too hard to make the story believable that I sometimes forget that I need to make it believable and hurry a little sooner, lol. Yeah, I have more on the lollipop story coming up, lol! Guest: It's funny how you show up right when I'm about ready to post it, lol! I'm glad you love this story, I love this story too! You are all very sweet! Thank you.[Chapter 6] Gabe watched a Tara walked away from Gavin, heading to her next class. He shifted his back off against the locker he had been leaning on, \"So, how was your talk.\" Tara stopped dead in her tracks and looked up from her feet at him, \"W-what?\" \"Nothing. . .\" Gabe smirked, hiding his disappointment, \"Nothing at all. . .\" It had been almost a week of her not remembering him, and it was like hell. She wouldn't talk to him, let alone look at him, unless he spoke to her, and then she'd only say little to a few words and walk away. \"So. . .How is your day been so far?\" he asked, trying not to feel hurt at her reaction to him. Mostly because in her eyes he knew she saw him as only a stranger, \"Anything exciting and troublesome happen?\" She blinked a few times, \"Are you referring to my break up with,. . .um, Gavin?\" He shrugged his shoulders, \"Only if you don't hate me for asking?\" \"No, not at all, I just wonder why no one told me?\" she stated, scratching her head, and looking down at her feet as they walked on. He could hear the pain in her voice, and wished he could comfort her all over again. \"I did.\" he muttered, looking towards her. \"Oh, It's nothing personal, it's just I don't really remember you, so I had to ask him myself. . . I-I, \" \"You didn't know if you could trust what I said.\" Gabe stated simply, \"I get it, thanks for the vote of confidence.\" She looked stunned, \"Wait, I'm sorry, it's just I don't exactly know how I know you, but I can tell my reactions to what you say are normal, I don't get extremely shy when we talk, or get weirded out when you talk to me, kind of like you know me.\" \"Because I do know you, geez, this is so silly. I know you don't feel weird talking to me, but it feels weird, like I am just another face that you'll forget.\" \"No. . .no, I just don't remember, maybe something will help me remember.\" He snorted, \"Like what? Making breakfast with you some more or something?\" She was surprised, \"I helped you make food?\" \"Yeah, so?\" \"Oh, it's nothing, I am just awful at making things, I always manage to burn everything.\" she chuckles, smiling, \"I wonder if it would help, let's try it, huh?\" Gabe felt happy by that, at least she was trying to know him again. \"Sure, get up at 5:09 am tomorrow and help me burn everything.\" \"Five in the morning? Isn't that a little to early?\" \"Not if you want the demon children to come in and taunt you.\" \"Demon children? What are you saying?\" she asked, looking generally confused. He smirked, \"Nothing important.\" \"Oh, ok.\" she smiled innocently. \"So I can't believe I'd forget about you.\" \"Why do you say it like that?\" Gabe asked, opening the class door for her. She looked really embarrassed as she went on, \"Because we're dating, it's weird how things like this happen.\" Gabe stopped in his tracks, mouth hanging open, almost speechless, eyes popping open, \"W-what?!\" She looked over at him, her brown doe eyes looked confused, \"What, that isn't right? That's what Gavin said. . .\" Gabe paused as he felt his phone vibrate. He picked it up and checked the message that Gavin had sent. \"Please, Tara doesn't remember, this is a sign that she doesn't have to remember the words I said in front of her. PLEASE?\" He sighed, he had never know how much of a coward Gavin was, and for the longest time had really looked up to the guy, but seriously, wasn't this a little far? Than Gabe realized something. Tara wouldn't remember the pain, and she could be free from that, so what if he had to lie and stuff. If it would help her not to remember, than he might do it. . .But why did he feel so bad. \"No, I mean, yeah, it's true. You're my girlfriend.\" He always thought those words wouldn't taste so bitter, but they did. Tara's beet red face was striking, and yes he felt small smile appear on his face, but it didn't change the sinking feeling in his stomach. Tara scratched her head awkwardly, \"Well, guess we better get into our seats.\" \"Yeah, right behind ya.\" Gabe said with fake smile. Tara talked to Audrey about Gavin and Gabe as they walked to a night party at someone's house. The girl who invited them had really liked Tara's advice on the radio from school the other day, her name was Ella Swanson, the second most popular girl in their school, Tara had been ready to decline when Audrey had butted in like always, and said they'd be there, \"So wait, Gabe told you he was your boyfriend?\" her best friend laughed in amazement, \"I can't believe it, why didn't you tell me?\" she asked, grabbing Tara's arm and looping it through hers, \"I'm so happy for you girl!\" \"Thanks, but I have to confess that I don't like Gabe that way since I barely know him, and still have feelings for Gavin. I'm heart-broken that I broke up with him, isn't that selfish?\" Audrey seemed confused, \"Wait, Gavin said that you broke up with him?\" \"Yeah, why?\" She asked, smiling sadly, and obviously at her friend. Audrey felt anger coming, but she tried to keep her cool. She would talk to Gabe about this later, \"So, are you excited to go to your first high school party ever?\" \"It's not my first one, Audrey.\" Tara smiled, her red hair in a loose braid, her red dress going down to her knee caps. \"But yes, I am excited to go to a party where we are actually wanted at.\" \"By some anyway.\" Audrey stated with a dry laugh as they saw the Swanson's house up ahead, seeing Amanda Klinger, a bigger figure the most of the girls, but still regular size, with long legs, blond hair, and the most feared and popular girl in school, walked her way out of her green Ford mustang, and give them a glare, than headed inside. \"I swear she is out to murder you.\" Audrey shuddered. Tara nodded, \"Yeah, socially anyway, which really isn't difficult, so why is she trying to ruin me? There is nothing that hasn't already been done to do so, I am already not popular?\" Tara stated shrugging her shoulders casually, walking into the loud head banging house. She looked around, trying to find people she recognized in a sea of unfamiliar faces. Than she froze stiff. \"Yeah, it's not like Stacy didn't already try all that before you two made up, and she moved away to the middle of who knows where.\" Audrey huffed, looking at Tara. Audrey paused to where Tara's eyes had bugged out too. Gabe was making out with a girl, well, actually Audrey could tell Amanda had kissed him first by the shocked look of dread on his face, and that the bitch was holding on tight, making sure that Tara saw it all. Gabe pulled Amanda away from him and said something Tara couldn't hear, but for some reason she felt drips of something falling down her face, tears? She turned right when Gabe's eyes saw hers, but before she could get out the door she saw Gavin holding some brunette, and fully making out with her. \"You've got to be kidding me?\" she whispered, feeling her heart stop a beat, and a cold feeling rush through her. Gabe came up behind her, his heart speeding, he saw Gavin and sighed, \"You know she kissed me right, not the other way around?\" he said to her, rubbing his head in frustration, \"I would never do what that tool would.\" Tara knew that he meant Gavin, but she didn't care any more, she felt too emotional. So she just turned around, and grabbed Gabe's head, and pressed her lips against his, holding her hands in his hair, and holding onto him for dear life. He breathed through his nose deeply, and even though it felt like it was the wrong thing to do, Gabe didn't care any more, he held her, and kissed her back, making sure to try and show her everything he felt, \"I'm sorry.\" she said, after a few moments, pulling away from him, \"I-I need to go. . .\" he saw the tears streaming down her face, and suddenly felt like such an ass. \"O-Okay, let's get going.\" he tried to say calmly, grabbing her shoulder and holding her close as they walked out of the now trashed party. \"Don't worry, I'll make you your favourite meal at home, and watch any show you want.\" \"Even New Girl?\" Tara sniffed, rubbing her eyes. He moaned mockingly, \"New girl, why me? Fine, but only if we watch the entire flipping' seasons all over again.\" Tara seemed surprised, \"You actually watched all the recent seasons with me on Netflix?\" Tara asked in wonder. Gabe smirked, and tapped her on the nose, \"Of course, because I'm the most freaking' awesome boyfriend.\" Tara smiled, \"Yes, you are.\" Audrey was right behind them, watching carefully how Gabe was treating Tara. It was weird seeing him treat someone this way, he'd never had this much sympathy for anyone before. \"Hey, come on, let's get out of here.\" she said, grabbing Tara's other arm, \"Who wants to party this late anyway, nothing but a bunch of drunk guys trying to get girls bedded.\" Gabe snorted, opening the old beat up Chevy door to his mom's car, \"Bedded, really?\" Tara smiled at that, \"Thanks guys, let's go before we have to see anything we wouldn't want too.\" \"Oh, I think I already did, and felt it too.\" Gabe gagged, wiping his mouth, \"That girls is too freaking strong for her own good, but I was kind enough not to push her, nice of me, right.\" Tara giggled, \"Sure, whatever you say.\" Gabe tried not to smile, \"And what is that suppose to mean?\" \"I think we all already know what that means weakling.\" Audrey smiled, giving a wink to Tara, who was already sitting in the passenger side. \"Ouch, nice one.\" he mocked, starting the car and locking the doors so Audrey couldn't get in. \"But you can never beat the champion.\" \"Hey!\" she yelled, as he sped off. Tara gave Gabe a look of disapproval. \"What, her house is three houses down from party central, she'll be fine.\" \"Gabe.\" Tara said. Gabe moaned in disappointment, \"Fine, I'll go back and get her!\" \"No, I mean, Gabe, I know.\" she said simply. \"Know, know what?\" he asked nervously, wondering what exactly she knew. \"I now know why you are my boyfriend, I do have. . .feelings for you, and when I saw you kiss Amanda, it really bothered me a lot. And than you made me feel better, you are a real knight in shinning armour.\" \"Oh, did it really? And knight in shinning armour, isn't that a little corny?\" he sighed relieved. But hold the phone for just one minute did Tara really just say she had feelings for him. \"Yeah, but. . .\" Tara paused, holding her arms closely to her. Uh oh, \"but\" is never a good sign. . . \"But I think I still maybe in love with Gavin, I'm sorry, I don't think I can date you, it would be wrong, like rebounding.\" Gabe felt hurt, but what was he expecting, he already thought this was going to happen, and that it would hurt like hell, and it did \"Rebound? Really. . .\" Tara stared down at her hands, \"Thank you for caring, I just don't. . .\" \"I wasn't really that into all of this anyway, let's just stay bffs. Ok?\" he stated, \"It was only a few dates anyway, just to see how we felt.\" Tara looked confused, smiling \"Bffs?\" \"Bitch friends forever.\" he laughed, \"You really don't remember anything do you?\" The thing was that when he had said those words, she felt something coming back to her, the image of Gabe and her cooking, and talking. . . \"Suddenly Gabe opened the door for her, hand out to help her, \"M'lady.\" he said with a smile, \"Your supper awaits you.\" She didn't respond to Gabe though, as she started to remember moments with him. She snapped back to the future, and took Gabe's hand, coming out of the door. \"Wait, Tara.\" Gabe said, grabbing her arm and turning her slightly towards him. \"Yeah?\" she asked, blinking from the electricity of tingles of his touch running down her arm, \"What is it?\" Gabe looked a little embarrassed, \"You might not remember this, but I got some guitar strings for your guitar. I'd kept forgetting that you needed some till now. Now don't hate on a player, at least I remembered. . .eventually.\" he smirked, handing the strings in small baggies to her. She felt herself flush as she started to remember the park, and what almost happened between them. \"T-thank you Gabe. . .\" She didn't meet his eyes. How could she have forgotten for so long about Gabe? A whole week?! \"Hey, I just remember something!\" she stated, grabbing something out of her small purse, \"I got two lollipops today from my teacher.\" she smiled shyly, handing him and apple one. \"Hope you don't mind apple, cherry flavour is my favourite.\" she smiled, taking off the suckers wrapper. Gabe smiled happily back at her, \"No, I don't mind green apple, it's actually my favourite as well.\" Tara smiled, putting hers inside her mouth and opening the house door. \"Good, I'm glad.\" \"After you m'lady.\" he teased, opening the door for her. \"Thank ye m'lord.\" she laughed, kicking off her shoes, and heading towards the kitchen, \"I'll make the popcorn, you just rest before you have to start laughing your pants off at the awesomeness of new girl Jess!\" Gabe rolled his eyes, \"You are so Jess!\" \"What, and you're Nick Miller or something? The best guy friend who saves me?\" Gabe chuckled, \"You must have forgotten half of season two already.\" \"Wait how many seasons are up of new girl?\" Tara asked looking at him through the kitchen door way. \"There are three dork.\" Gabe laughed, taking off his shoes, and relaxing on the couch. \"Three?! I swear I only remember one, I thought for sure they were gonna cancel it!\" \"Well, they didn't nut ball, so hurry up with the popcorn so we can catch you up girl!\" he teased. \"Tell me, what happened to Jane by Design?\" \"Oh, they totally cancelled it, thank the Lord!\" Gabe sang happily. \"No! Really? That was my favourite show!\" Tara complained, bringing in the popcorn and sitting down beside him. \"How could they?\" He snorted, putting his arm casually around her on the couch like it was the norm, \"Because they are super smart, that's why.\" Tara playfully hit him in the stomach softly, \"Jerk.\" He looked down at her grinning, \"Nah, I think they made a right decision, or I defiantly would never watch shows with you ever.\" She playfully hit him again, \"Jerk.\" she said breathlessly, as he came closer to her. \"Am I really?\" He asked sweetly, lifting his hand and brushing the strands of hair out of her face. She swallowed, and blinked a few times. He saw the deep blush show up on her face, and he gulped, she was beautiful is her red cocktail dress. And she could tell he had looked her over. She stared into his eyes, and felt her heart beating loudly, as he leaned closer. He searched her eyes for permission, and she granted him permission by the simple little nod of her head. They leaned closer till all they could feel was each others mouths and their hands intertwined together. Tara moaned, as they both went down on the couch, her on bottom, him on top, as he lifted her hands above her head, holding her wrist gently. He parted away from her a little, and rested his forehead against hers, \"I think we better stop.\" She shut him up by kissing him deeply, and running her fingers through his hair. They kept getting deeper and deeper into their make out session, till Gabe stopped, pulling away from her only a few inches, resting his forehead against the couches arm rest, groaning. \"Why?\" she asked in bliss, caressing his cheek with her thumb as he looked over at her, her eyes closed, wanting more. \"I don't want to stop.\" \"Exactly why we need ta.\" he said in whisper, as he pulled away a little more from her, \"If we don't, we aren't going to stop at all, and who wants the demon children making fun of us, or our parents walking in and killing us.\" \"I don't care.\" she whimpered, staring into his eyes, looking at him with wanting, as she wrapped her arms around his neck, \"Please Gabe?\" He wanted to, he really wanted to, so badly, \"This isn't a good idea, we don't want this to lead to anything we'll regret, okay. We need to cool down, Tara. You are just feeling confused.\" he growled, getting up and standing away from her. She sat up looking at him, angry that he'd tell her how she felt, \"No! No I'm not!\" Gabe sighed, raking a hand through his hair that had gotten messy by Tara running her hands through it, \"Yes, you are, Tara, you just admitted that you still are into Gavin, my freakin' best friend, we need to just forget this ever happened, okay?\" Tara came back to her senses, and tried to calm down, \"O-okay. . .Do you. . .do you still want to watch something. . .or. . .or. . .\" Okay, maybe not all the way to her senses. Gabe turned around and grabbed his shoes from off the ground, \"No, I think we need to both go to sleep. It's late and everyone is most likely asleep also.\" Gabe said, trying not to look her in the eyes as he waited for what she might say. \"O-okay. . .\" she said, staring up at him, and getting up, \"Good night, Gabe.\" she tried to say steadily, as she ran upstairs to her room. She shut the door behind her and sighed, leaning against it, closing her eyes. She hadn't told him she remembered everything. . . She had never felt that much want for someone, and her head was spinning by the feel of him still holding her, and kissing her in ways she ever only read about, \"What did I do?!\" she sighed, holding her hands to her heart in surprise, \"I can't believe I just did that!\" Gabe walked into his room and threw his shoes on his bed. He rubbed his head, \"What the hell did I just do?\" Justanothergirl~ Oh no, what in the world just happened, lol! Gabe kissed Tara, whoo hoo, and then she returned the favor! Scary how these things can happen so quickly. ;) Reviewers time!: TheAmazingNorwegian: Thank you, I'm so glad I didn't, I hope you don't mind my updating slowly, I am trying to go faster, practice makes perfect! ;) Bethan Forever: You know already, but this is most certainly not a dream, but it does get better! No worries! 3 I am trying to update sooner, so I'll keep trying. I know Gavin is a jerk, but he gets better, I swear. Poor Gabe is right, lol! I totally understand that bug, I got it myself, that's the reason I started writing this, lol! Thank you for being patient with me! 3 Guest: I am so excited that you are still loving this story for I am too! Lol! I knew I needed to have a little twist, almost all the stories, fan fic, and regular fic, I alway try to add a twist to it, it's the most fun thing in the world! Keeps the readers on their toes too, wondering what will happen next, lol.[Chapter 7] Gabe pulled his Guns and Roses t-shirt down on the rest of the way on his body, and then zipped his pants up he'd put on, and quickly ran out his bedroom door to head to the second bathroom. Opening the closed-door, he got a surprise. \"Chloë, what in the hell is this?!\" Chloë, who was bent and on her knees by the tub, stared wide-eyed at Gabe. \"G-Gabe, why are you up this early?\" \"Where did this dog come from?\" Gabe asked sternly, crossing his arms, \"And why are you washing the dog in the Adams tub?\" he asked, as he heard someone come behind him and gasp. \"It's a Husky? Why is Chloë washing a Husky? Where'd it come from?\" asked the red-head in a shaky voice. Chloë looked offended, \"HE, he is not an \"it\", he's a he!\" Tara smiled weakly, \"Y-yeah, so where'd you get him from Chloë?\" She smiled slyly, \"Tara, are you afraid of Gibson?\" Tara gulped, \"Um, no. . .\" she glanced over at Gabe nervously, than back at Chloë, \"Okay, so I'll admit, I am kind of afraid.\" Gabe tried not to smile, because he didn't want Chloë to think he was letting this go so easily, so he cleared his throat, and gave her a disciplinary glare, \"Chloë, it won't matter if Tara is afraid of him or not, we are not keeping him, and that's the end of this discussion.\" \"What?! Why not?!\" Chloë asked, pouting as the wet puppy's tongue hung out, \"Because, this is not our house, and he could belong to someone else, we need to take him to the vet and see what we can do.\" \"So than we set up flyers, and if no one claims him, we ask Mr. and Mrs. Adams if we can keep him?\" Gabe sighed, \"Fine, but just hold him in here and dry him off after your done giving him a bath, and will ask after we set up flyers.\" \"Yay!\" Chloë giggling, hugging the puppy, who licked her face and barked loudly. \"And try to keep him quite, people are still sleeping here you know!\" Gabe scolded, grabbing his tooth-brush, \"And he really smells, make sure to scrub him up ya demon child.\" Gabe grumbled the last part under his breath as he went down stairs, \"Like I would brush my teeth in where there is such a smelly mut.\" \"Hey, that's not nice.\" Tara said, quickly following after him. She was still in her brown oversized t-shirt, and pink and blue plaid pj bottoms, and blue slippers. Gabe chuckled, \"Says the terrified little girl of a puppy dog.\" \"Okay, that dog is actually pretty big sized, it is completely normal for me to be a little timid.\" she mumbled, walking beside him down the stairs. \"Right, whatever you say.\" he snickered, and she gave him a little punch. \"Shut up.\" Tara jumped at something, the dog ran past her, and she yelped, grabbing Gabe's arm. \"Gibson, Why are you running?!\" Chloë yelled after Gibson, running quickly after him, \"Water falling on your back couldn't have scared you off that easily!\" Gabe looked down at Tara, her eyes were shut tight like she was in a certain type of pain, or was waiting for it to begin, than she slowly peeked up at him, than backed away quickly, flushing, and pulling some of her non-brushed hair out of her face, \"So. . .\" \"Break fast.\" he said, looking away, and walking down the rest of the way as if her grabbing him hadn't affected him at all, and that the smell of her wasn't killing him. \"Right.\" she muttered, rubbing her neck awkwardly, while feeling completely confused at how he felt as she followed behind him. The dog was being pulled their way again, and Tara quickly hid behind him. Gabe sighed, as he felt every part of her fingers gently clutching his shirt, and he couldn't believe how it felt so good just having the tips of her fingers gently pressed against his back, \"Really?\" he asked, smiling back at her. Tara eyed the dog from behind Gabe, than shivered realizing how close she was to him, and backed away once more, \"Yes, really.\" Gabe sighed , and went to the sink, ready to brush his teeth. Tara got out the food, put them where she always did, and went to grab the pans. She anciently bumped into Gabe as he was in the middle of gargling. She gasped in horror as he hacked up the mouth wash. \"Oh my gosh, Gabe! I'm so sorry!\" she practically screamed, patting him hard on the back, making sure he was going to be okay. He held onto his chest and looked over at her after he was done, \"I-I could have-have died!\" She almost looked about ready to cry, \"S-sorry!\" He gave sympathy and a half lifted smile, \"It's okay, just next time try to aim your.\" She stared back at him as he just smiled, \"You okay there?\" than she grabbed his head, and pulled him to her, and gave him a kiss. \"Mmm.\" Than she backed away not looking into his startled eyes, and went over to start cooking like it never happened, but the deep, dark, blush on her cheeks told differently. He came over to her, grinning like a fool. \"You brushed your teeth before me, huh, how, or did my mouth just provide you with it?\" Her heart sped by his words, and how near he was, she hadn't realized he was so close to her. \"Um, I got up at three.\" \"Three in the morning?\" Gabe stated, surprised, \"Seriously?\" \"Yes. . .\" \"Wow.\" he said, looking at the back of her head, \"So, you must have been thinking of something that really was bothering you.\" She turned around quickly, \"No, that's not it, I loved i-it!\" she breathed in shocked, he was so close to her, as he put his hands gently on both sides of her face. . . then Chloë came barging in with that mut of a doggie! Gabe gave them both a death glare, \"What the heck, Chloë?!\" Chloë looked back and forth between Gabe and Tara, as she held Gibson, \"Ew! You guys aren't thinking about kissin' are you? Let me at least leave the room before you do!\" she said, making a face. Gabe smirked, and pulled Tara to him, giving her a huge smooch, and heard his sister screech, and run with the dog following after. \"What is going on down here?!\" Gabe heard his mother ask crossly. Gabe parted from Tara and looked over at his mom, smiling nervously, \"Makin' breakfast. . .\" \"Yeah, well you are burning the eggs, and I didn't know cooking consisted of mouth to mouth resuscitation.\" his mother said, shaking her head tiredly, \"Tara, upstairs. I've seen Gabe make breakfast plenty of times on his own. I'll help him. He and I need to talk aways.\" she said, glaring over at Gabe. Gabe let go of Tara's waist, and looked her straight in the hazel doe eyes of hers, \"See ya later.\" Tara nodded, and ran past Mrs. LaViolet . \"Gabe-\" Gabe stopped her, \"Listen mom, I know you think I'm just messing around with her, but I'm not, I was only teasing Chloë. I have feelings for Tara, but I'm not going to. . .you know. . .take advantage. . .\" \"But I thought she had a boyfriend?\" Becky sighed, rubbing her head slightly as though she had a migraine. \"Nope, they broke up.\" Gabe stated simply, putting the almost complete burnt eggs int o a plate. \"And when was this?\" she asked simply, and yet it still frustrated him, her asking. \"Just a week and a half.\" he grumbled, starting on his task, \"Why do you ask, mother dearest?\" he asked her, giving an annoyed half grin. \"No reason, just that it sounds like she, and you still need some time. Her from her ex, you from, well whatever just happened. And second. . .\" Gabe groaned, \"Oh great, here it comes, the \"birds and the bees\" business and what not to do when you are living with a beautiful hormonal girl who lives right next door to you. . . and who smells amazing. . .\" \"Whoa, slow down cow-boy, I'm not saying that I don't trust your judgement, but you really should cool down. Yes, Tara is a very pretty young woman, and I'm sure she wants to be around you just as much as you want to be around her. . .\" \"I sense a -but- forming in this conversation?\" Gabe stated, smiling over at her, \"I thought you said you'd help me cook?\" \"Don't try to change the subject on me young man.\" she smiled, a gleam in her eye. \"You know I would like Tara as a daughter in law some day, but not so quickly, and grand children are not even on the list now so you kno-\" \"Yes, mom, I get it, will you please just talk about something else. I am being careful! And the whole kissing thing was just this one time thing to freak out Chloë, because she was being a brat, okay, so just drop it please!?\" he begged, feeling totally uncomfortable with everything they were talking of. His mom seemed surprised, \"Well, I'm so sorry, I didn't think I was such an awful burden to you, Gabe!\" she said, choking up, looking hurt. Oh great, she was using the \"I'm going to make you feel guilty over everything that was said!\" mom thing that she always did when she didn't like what Gabe had to said. Gabe sighed, \"Mom, come on, you know what I mean. I'm going to be turning eighteen in a few months, a here you are coddling me like I'm still that eight year old little boy.\" Simon walked in, \"Mother, Chloë has a puppy in her room, and she said she wouldn't share! Tell her she must, tell her you insist that the puppy belongs to me as well!\" the boy complained, looking wide-eyed at her. She looked down at Simon, \"Wait, a dog?\" Gabe chuckled, \"Seriously mom, you walked right past Chloë and didn't even realize?\" Mrs. LaVoilet seemed surprised, \"What?! Why is there a dog in this house, Gabe?!\" Gabe shrugged, flipping over the pancakes he was making, \"How should I know. I only found Chloë holding the dog in the bath tub to give him a bath, ask her how she got a hold of him.\" His mother groaned, \"Why are my children all trying to drive me crazy this early in the morning?!\" \"Because we're related to you.\" Gabe teased as she went to go with Simon to where Chloë was, she turned a second back to Gabe, \"Gabrielle, we are going to talk about this later, understand me?\" \"Yes ma'am, but for now I'm just going to try and make this bacon without any nagging parental advice coming through the side of my ear and out the other.\" \"I heard that!\" she said back, \"You are next in line for doing the laundry.\" Gabe wasn't to shaken as he did a mocking flip of his pancakes as he put them on a plate. \"Oh, whoopee ti do. Like I don't already.\" \"Hey.\" Tara said softly, sneaking in towards him, \"Need any help?\" He looked down at the bacon he was putting into the skillet, \" You could set out silver ware, and glasses and plates, napkins etc. . .\" Tara felt a change in his tone, \"Um, okay, is everything alright?\" He closed his eyes for a brief second, \"Gosh, why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me about my freaking feelings?\" He saw out of the corner of his eye that she was cringing and about to apologize, \"Don't. It's not you, it's me. My mom can just push my buttons, ya know?\" Tara smiled, and laid a hand on his shoulder, \"Gabe, any person who has a mother knows that. And they only push your buttons cause they care.\" He nodded, but couldn't agree as much with her as he would have liked too. \"You know, Tara, you always seem to see good in people, how you do it when this world is so messed up I wouldn't know.\" She smiled, \"Well, I'd rather see the good, than the negative that doesn't need focused on, but even I know what you mean. But that is not your mom, she's just trying to raise her kids right, and protect you guys the way she knows how. I'd say that is a pretty great mom you got right there, nothing negative about her.\" Gabe snorted, \"Okay, she is a little positive.\" \"Hey, she wants you to be careful, what's wrong with that, all mothers do that. Well, the ones that care anyways.\" Tara said, smiling and giving him a little teasing shove. He nodded, pushing her teasingly also, \"Okay, so I am blessed to have her.\" \"That's right mister sad sack.\" she said, grabbing the plates and silverware, \"I mean, my mom is an awesome mom, and she does care for me, but sometimes I wish she would push me a little harder to be more careful.\" \"What, your mom is awesome Tara! She is the flippin' bomb! I mean, she lets you get away with almost anything!\" he declared, handing her the orange juice to pour into the cups set out. \"Oh, don't forget milk for my step dad, he hates orange juice.\" Gabe nodded, \"Already on it.\" he said, setting down the glass of milk beside one of the plates on the table. \"Thank you.\" He smiled, \"What for, it's just milk, anyone can do it, or I should say pour it.\" She shook her head, \"Not just for the milk you goof.\" she paused, and looked up at him, a bashful look showing upon her features, \"For acting like you were my boyfriend when I didn't remember you.\" He looked back at her from the skillet, a hopeful expression on his face, \"Oh. . . so you remember. . .everything?\" 'Everything that we have done together?' he thought to himself. \"Well, yeah. I even remember Gavin, and then you almost breaking his jaw when he said he didn't care for me.\" Gabe sighed, rubbing his neck, \"Yeah, that probably wasn't one of my smartest decisions ever. . .\" Tara nodded, \"Probably not. . .\" she smiled at him, and twirled the little ring on her pinkie. \"I'm going to tell you though, that I was way more concerned for you than I was for Gavin. . .\" He seemed pleased by that, even though he pretended to be filling plates with food, \"Really?\" She looked down, biting her lip, \"Yes, I felt bad that you got hurt because of me, and the way you were walking like you'd just lost one of your dearest friends made it even worse.\" she heaved, leaning against the chair. Gabe sneaked a look at her, \"You look really nice today.\" Not wanting to talk of Gavin anymore. She smiled up at him, \"Thanks.\" \"No problem. Hey, would you like to learn how to sing?\" Gabe asked, \"I need another lead singer, I bet you'd be great.\" he said softly, coming up behind her and leaning into her as he sat a napkin beside the plate. Tara felt heat flash onto her cheeks and down as he leaned in some more, lifting up her red hair and pushing it over to one side. He traced his lips against her jaw line, and downward. She gasped as his hands went around both sides of her waist, and her back side was completely against him. \"W-what do you-you mean?\" she moaned as he nibbled gently against her skin, \"We need a new singer in the band, would you like to be one of the leads beside me?\" he asked, holding her tighter and making her knees go weak by his gentle kisses on the nape of her neck and down to her shoulder. \"I-I can't T-talk when you are d-doing t-that-\" she said, breathless as he nibbled softly on the side of her ear, \"I-I mean I re-really can't, mmm.\" she sighed closing her eyes and leaning into him. He snickered, \"And I really can't keep away from you.\" He moaned as she turned around to him, looking up at him in a daze. Gabe released his embrace when the dog ran in, and quickly backed away from her, a sheepish smile on his face, which was not normal for him. \"So, what do you say?\" She was still dazed with happiness when he asked, and gazed at him some most enduringly, and pleased, \"What do you mean?\" she asked, not remembering anything that was said in the moment he touched her. \"Would you go in place of Gavin as the lead singer of the band besides myself?\" Gabe asked casually as everyone started to walk in. \"What?!\" Tara exclaimed, looking surprised, eyes wide \"Why would you replace Gavin?!\" Gabe looked annoyed, \"Will take about it after others aren't in ear shot, okay?\" Tara saw the her entire family was staring at the puppy not realizing the conversation between Gabe and Tara. \"Why is there a dog in here?\" Mr. Adam's asked, raising an eyebrow questionably at his wife. \"What? I didn't bring that cute little pup in, not that I'd mind though! Come here you little cutie!\" Tara's mom proclaimed, going on her knees to try and get the dog over to her. He came and jumped on her and licked her face. \"Oh-hoho, look at this little guy, he is so cute! Oh Rob, we've got to keep him, he is so precious!\" she said, petting the dog. \"Well, dear-\" \"No, he's my dog! I found him first!\" Chloë stated firmly, going over to hold the puppy. \"Honey, I'm sure it would be fine with Mr. And Mrs. Adams, but you need to ask them.\" her mother said, giving and apologetic look to Mrs. Adams. Mrs. Adams just smiled, \"Oh, it's alright, of course he's yours, right Rob?\" Mr. Adams just sighed, knowing he didn't want to start in a fight with his wife, \"Well, okay.\" \"YAY!\" Chloë squealed, \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" Gabe shook his head, \"Nope, first we need to see if the dog belongs to anyone first, so we need to put up posters.\" Mr. Adams tried to stop the relieved look coming upon his face, \"Oh, that is true!\" Chloë sighed. \"But if no one claims him he's yours!\" Tara said, trying to cheer the little girl up. Chloe's eyes sparkled, \"That's true! And I don't believe anyone would leave their puppy outside or even let go of him for even a second out of their eyesight!\" she smiled, grabbing Tara in hug, \"Thank you for being so nice Tara!\" than she ran to the door with the puppy right beside her. \"Chloë! Breakfast first.\" Gabe said sternly, wiggling his finger for her to come back, \"Now.\" \"Wait, Gabe, let her play with him for now, she has a day off of school anyways.\" his mom said, smiling at the sight of her little girls giggling. \"She can eat later when she's more hungry.\" Gabe tried not to argue, so he just agreed with her, \"Whatever you say ma.\" \"Thank you.\" his mother said with a smirk, \"My little grown up!\" she said, ruffling his head of hair. He smiled, a flushed look coming on his cheeks as he saw Tara giggle over in the corner by her mother \"O-kay, mom, you can stop, now sit and I'll serve you.\" Miss Lavoilet smiled, \"Sure thing kid.\" she than looked over at Tara, and gave a smile, \"So, how are you doing?\" Mrs. Adams nodded, \"Yes, Tara, tell us, do you remember anything of Gabe?\" Tara blushed, remembering the kisses he left on her shoulder and neck, \"Um. . .yes, pretty much everything. . .\" she said, looking down at her plate, slicing some warm pancake, and shoving it in her mouth so she didn't have to talk, the surp was a little more sweet than she remembered, \"Mmph.\" she squirmed, trying to eat and swallow the big bite of pancake, 'What was I thinking?!' she thought to herself, as she drank some of her orange juice to help her. \"Oh, well that's good.\" Mrs. LaVoilet said, smirking knowingly, \"So you really do like my son, huh?\" Tara tried not to choke, and had to cough to get it down the right pipe. \"Um, cough cough , what?\" \"You like my son. Right? As in you would like to date my son.\" Gabe's mom said, starting to talk more serious. Tara tried not making eye contact, and looked over at Gabe as he gave a shake of his head. \"Not like that, we're just friends.\" Tara sighed, feeling her cheeks getting even more rosy. Gabe went next, \"Yeah, it would be totally weird. . .\" Mrs. LaVoilet sighed, knowing they were lying, \"Sure.\" Mr. Adams looked confused, \"Why does it matter if they like each other?\" Mrs. LaVoilet looked at the oblivious man, \"Really? You don't think having teens who are both in the same age group and hormonal aren't going to think about each other in that way?\" she said, lifting her hands up dramatically. Mrs. Adams gasped, \"What, never my Tara, she is not that sort of girl!\" \"So than I guess you're saying that them pretty much making out in here doesn't mean anything?\" Mrs. Adams looked offended, \"What? Where did you hear that?!\" \"I didn't exactly hear it. No, I saw it happening when I walked into this kitchen this morning.\" Mrs, LaVoliet replied heatedly. \"Wait, and why are you telling us now?!\"Mr. Adams asked, his cheeks flushing with anger. \"Because the two youngest are not in here, and I just saw it an hour or so ago!\" She replied defending herself. Gabe groaned, sitting in the seat next to Tara as their parents argued about what happened between them. \"Great.\" Gabe sighed, looking over at her, realizing he could move his hand to hers and cover it with his own, \"So what do you say, join the band?\" He asked with a smile to her. She looked back at him nervously, \"Will I even know how to sing right?\" He rolled his eyes, \"For all the showers I've heard you taken when you're sing I think it's safe to say you are already talented.\" \"You listen to when I take showers?!\" Tara whispered as their parents yelled at each other. Gabe blushed, looking annoyed, \"I passed by the door of the bathroom to go downstairs sometimes and I can hear you, acting like you're the next Whitney Houston. Not that you're that good.\" he said, taking a bite of his bacon as she glared at him, \"What, I'm just saying no one can be that good. . .She was a freakin' legend. . .\" She smiled, \"Of course, but I'm still good right?\" He smiled, squeezing her hand gently, \"You are great. And not just at singing.\" She blushed looking away shyliy, \"Thanks, you too.\" she said, her stomach flopping as he caressed her palm with his thumb. He chuckled, \"I really want to kiss you, Tara, I thought I should stay away, but I don't think I can.\" he said weakly. \"I don't want you to.\" she replied, holding his hand with both her own. \"please don't stop.\" she said, looking into his eyes bravely, her brown eyes pleading, but a smile still softly forming slowly on her lips \"Ever.\" He smiled, not caring anymore if their parents saw, and kissed her. \"Good.\" \"You guys know we are here?!\" Mr. Adam's said, looking upset, \"Tara, you and Gabe are going to have to be kept on high security.\" \"What?!\" They both stammered. 'Damn it, I shouldn't have kissed her in front of em.' Gabe thought gloomily, looking at the surprised Tara. Tara nodded, letting go of his hand, \"I understand, sir.\" He was hurt she let go of his hand, he couldn't understand what was wrong with that. \"But-\" she stuttered, looking up fiercely, \"I-I would like to officially date Gabe if that is alright with you guys. . .\" her entire face had turned completely red, and she looked about ready to hurl by being so brave by asking such a question. Gabe smiled, wanting to grab her a spin her around, 'Gosh, that sounds so freaking corny.' he thought, feeling stupidly happy. \"No.\" Mrs. Adams said firmly, \"You and Gabe are not allowed to date, or even touch one another ever again.\" A/N: Oh gosh, I feel I hurried that a bit, but I just wanted to finish for you guys and for myself. I'm really liking my story so far, I know that sounds conceited, but I just love writing about Gabe and Tara, and their family. :) But mostly them. Review time whoo hoo!: Bethan Forever: Yes, yes they almost did, but I felt that would not be smart since they are too young, but I could just see high schoolers doing this, so I just went by memory of what I wished would have happened to me with the boy I liked once upon a time, lol. I see it as this, Gabe is just a guy who isn't one to like to seem like a wuss, but with Tara he's can't help but think of himself as one, but doesn't care just because of how much he likes her, lol. He's even forgetting about how she said she wasn't exactly over Gavin, cause he doesn't want to be away from her, lol. In my mind he's just a sweet guy who is afraid of showing his feelings, or acting like a girl, cause he's weird, lol. Nope, Tara's not remembering right now, she will though. Tara is kind of like a nice blond in a red heads body. Lol. He only wants one girl at this moment, so he is defiantly not into anyone now except her, lol! :) Bitch Friends Forever are the best! Guest: Whoo hoo, glad you loved that chapter. Hope you loved this one, even if it's confusing. I did rush probably, but oh well. Hee hee. XD Updated! Okay this probably sounds stupid, but if this ever was a show. I think I'd want this song to be the theme song: Everybody Talks: by Neon Trees. What would you think you would choose if it was? Not saying it's that great, I just love thinking about these kinda things, lol.[Chapter 8] For the last two days Tara and Gabe felt as though vultures were eyeing them every time one of them moved an inch. Gabe had to start sleeping in his sister room where they moved his bed. Mrs. Adams had given Chloe a walkie talkie to keep beside her at night, and was suppose to report in if Gabe even tried to slip out to go to the bathroom at night. The sad thing was, was that Chloe's room was down stairs and Tara's room was all the way up the flight of stairs. Mrs. Adams had made well sure that her and Mr. Adams had the room right across from Tara's. But that wasn't even the sad thing. The sad thing was that they thought that they could keep Gabe and Tara away from each other. \"Hey.\" Gabe whispered, closing the door behind him, \"How'd you get past the dinging of the bell your mom so willingly hung on your door with the rope?\" he asked, seeming impressed, taking her in his arm. Tara smiled, hugging him back, \"A girl never shares to many secrets.\" Gabe chuckled, and walked with her to the kitchen, \"Well, at least you didn't have to try and escape a little demon child who wakes at the smallest noises, gosh it's unsettling.\" he shook his bed head out with his hands, and gingerly looked Tara up and down, \"Still in your sheep Pjs, I see.\" he teased as she stuck her tongue out at him,\" Yeah, well, I've been told they are very attractive on me.\" she teased back, patting him on the chest and walking away. He closed his eyes and sighed, feeling a bit jittery over what she said, \"Really, like who?\" he asked, staring over at her. She smiled, a glimmer shone in her eyes, and she took her mug out of the cabinet and went over to the fresh, still pouring, pot of coffee. \"Well, my mom did. She thought I was so adorable.\" she said, putting the coffee pot back in to finish the rest that was left. She lifted the black coffee to her lips and took a tiny sip, not wanting to burn herself, \"Ouch, mm, burnt my tongue.\" she cried softly. Gabe snickered, and Tara glared at him. He shrugged his shoulders, \"Hold on, so what are you saying, that I should find sheep attractive? Sorry Captain Nuttie. I hate sheep.\" She covered her mouth and glared at him, \"How can you not like my sheep?!\" Gabe smirked, \"Hold on, I ain't finished!\" he said, heading her way. \"Sheep are only ever cute if you are wearing them.\" he said, hands wrapped around her waist. She gave him a look. He sighed, happily, \"Sounded a lot cooler in my head.\" she nodded, wrapping her arms gently around his shoulders. \"That so, is it? Than all you had to say was how you think I'm attractive.\" Even saying those word made Tara blush a little. It was still weird thinking that Gabe found her attractive. It wasn't that she didn't think she was ugly. But it still felt bold saying what she was saying. The little red hues on Gabes face made her even more aware of how he might think of her. \"You are a beauty all your own.\" he said softly, nuzzling his head against her slowly and gently. She giggled, and punched his playfully in the arm, \"You know that is even more extremely corny than all the things I've ever said, right?\" he nodded, pulling her closer to him, and kissing her on her forehead sweetly. \"I know, and if it ever gets out to anyone, you know I will have to just keep on doing it till you weep from the corniest of it all.\" She shook her head, \"And why in the world do you think compliments would embarrass me?\" she stated, lightly hitting him in the gut, \"Now where should we start, with pancakes?\" she asked, letting go of him, and heading for the fridge. She was getting out the eggs when he came up and started kissing her neck. \"Stop Gabe! Our parents will kill us for just being down here together, but at least they'd think we were just doing it to make breakfast.\" He moaned, \"Seriously? I can't even kiss you, right when we were just starting?\" She laughed, and pushed him away, turning to him with a stern look, \"Gabe, listen, whatever this is between us, it needs a pause, so we can actually hang out together, and spend time with each other.\" He understood that, but it was hard when the main hanging out together he wanted to do was make her feel on fire. Wanted to feel her breathing heavily against his lips as his body moved with hers. But out of it all, the thing he wanted the most was to have her near him, to hear her laugh at one of his stupid joke, make breakfast with him, and her face as she'd blush by him catching her checking him out. And if not touching each other was how to keep in each others lives, than he would try his best not to even breathe against her. Because with just a look towards her, his heart throbbed, and the joy he felt whenever he saw her only furthered his determination for her. \"So, scrambled as usual?\" he asked, smiling, and she understood right away. \"Yes please.\" He shifted away from her and over to the stove top to start. \"Thank you.\" she said, rubbing the back of his shoulder, \"For understanding.\" He nodded, \"I know, I know. I'm a saint, right? You temptress.\" he said mockingly. She smacked his back, going over to set out plates. \"What, you don't think I know how to tempt you?\" He chuckled, \"Tara, you already tempt me, not the point. The point is, if you tried to actually tempt me, you'd probably fail.\" She frowned at him, \"No I wouldn't.\" He cracked the eggs and put them in a bowl, whisking, and looked over at her, \"You don't think you, the most adorable sheep wearing angle, could actually tempt me by simply trying?\" She grinned, glancing at him slyly, \"I'd have my own little ways.\" He snorted, \"Okay, so should I just start calling you, Temptress Tara, Queen of the Pj sheep's.\" he joked, turning on the skillet and pouring in the eggs. She bowed all silly like, \"At your service m'lord.\" she proclaimed in a deafening voice. \"Sh, don't want them to know we're down here.\" he hissed, putting his finger to his lips to emphasize his point. Tara looked ruffled when he spoke those words, and came over towards him heatedly, \"What is so wrong about us making breakfast? Why is it so bad to just make a simple meal together?\" Gabe smiled softly, she was beginning to become more outspoken that he remembered her being. Which wasn't always the best thing, \"Because they know we want to do more than make a simple meal together.\" he teased, pulling the eggs out and on a platter, than handing it to her. She put it in the middle of the table and turned back to him, \"But why would we do something that stupid while their in the house?\" Gabe had to agree it was stupid their parents thought that they could get away with anything with their sneaky ears listening in, and their eyes wandering everywhere. \"Because your parents want to keep you safe.\" said a feminine voice. Gabe rolled his eyes, and silently kept cooking. Gabe's mom walked up to them, \"Listen, I know this is hard, but at least we are still letting you guys go to school as a couple, right?\" that decision was the only one Tara and Gabe got in their favor. Gabe nodded anyway, \"Yes ma'am.\" \"So how long did you know we were in here?\" Tara asked setting the forks out. Becky helped by grabbing the orange juice, \"Well, maybe just a couple of minutes or so. I didn't barge in right away if it makes any difference.\" Gabe knew his mom still felt bad about how things went down, so he and Tara had decided not to be too upset. She was just trying to protect Gabe anyway. Tara understood, and thanked Becky. \"So mom, hows work?\" Gabe asked after a few minutes of uncomfortable silence. Mrs. LaViolet smiled, and patted his back all motherly like, \"Doing good, I got promoted. I was going to tell you at supper, but I figured out yesterday that I had to go to a meeting tonight.\" Gabe's eyes widened, \"Wait, you got the promotion?\" Becky nodded, and excited look in her eye. \"So does that mean we'll have enough to move out into a normal apartment?\" Becky slowly nodded again, looking like she was keeping in her excitement for a while now, \"Yes, yes it does!\" Gabe laughed happily, \"Mom, this is great!\" they hugged, and Tara could see that Mrs. LaVoilet only wanted to make her son proud of her. \"So when do we move?\" he asked, holding onto his moms arms. She grinned, \"In a couple of days.\" Gabe jumped , and pumped his fist, \"Yeah, baby! This is freakin' awesome mom!\" he shouted hysterically. \"Gabrielle, sh, don't wake everyone! I'm gonna go now and get a little more rest. Give you two some alone time.\" she said, trying to seem stern, but she was too happy it only seemed like words. Once she left, Gabe went straight to Tara and lifted her in his arms. But she was not as happy has him. Half way through them kissing he realized this, \"What's wrong, sheep lady?\" She punched his side, and tried to smile, \"Nothing, nothing at all is wrong. \" He looked confused, \"Wait, are you upset about something I said?\" She shook her head, \"Lets make the bacon next, show me how?\" she asked, putting on a fake grin. He didn't buy it but he couldn't force her to tell him what was wrong, so he helped her get out the bacon, and showed her how not to burn it. \"Gabe,\" she whispered. He looked down at her, worried, \"Yeah, sheep lady?\" \"You know. . .\" she looked up at him, her brown doe eyes looked hurt, \"You know Gabrielle is a girls name right?\" He glared mockingly at her, \"Seriously, you're going there, seriously?\" She laughed and hit him with pancake batter. \"Hey, not cool!\" he murmured, taking the spoon out of her hand, and scooting her back against the counter. She closed her eyes and waited breathlessly for him to kiss her. He looked at her nervous face and leaned in closer, his lips almost on hers. Than he put his hand in the bowl of batter and smacked it on her face. \"Ah! Gabe!\" she laughed as he walked quickly away to the other side so she couldn't get him, trying to laugh quietly as to not walk anyone up, \"Got ya.\" She wiped the batter off her face and threw it back at him, \"Jerk.\" she stated simply, chasing him, and laughing. He grabbed her waist and pulled her towards him, kissing some of the batter off her cheek. Just being so close to him made Tara shiver in pleasure. They stared into each others eyes, and Gabe leaned in tracing his finger against her lip, \"Tara-\" he was interrupted by loud foot steps racing down the stairs. They parted and tried to wash themselves off with a the kitchen towel. \"What are you guys doing?\" Chloe asked, looking suspiciously at them. Gabe threw some batter at her face, \"Making breakfast. How about you?\" She glared at him, \"Gabe! Don't hit me with that stuff! It's gross!\" she complained, rubbing it off and pushing him. Gabe just chuckled. \"Whatever you say.\" he than flicked some more at her, annoyed of her walking in on them all the time. \"Gabe!\" she yelled. \"Gabe, stop, your sister doesn't like it.\" Tara told Gabe sternly, as she helped Chloe, by taking the batter off with a towel. \"There you go.\" Chloe smiled up at Tara, \"You know you can kiss my brother. I don't care if you do, it's my mommy that does.\" Tara blushed, \"Well-\" Chloe's eyes brightened, \"Hey, why don't I draw you two?\" Gabe shut Chloe down, \"Up stairs, now!\" \"What, but I didn't do anything!\" Chloe complained, crossing her arms. \"Now.\" Gabe said simply, pointing to the stairs, \"We'll get you when breakfast is ready.\" Chloe huffed angrily and ran back up stairs, \"I hate you!\" \"Love you too.\" he teased back, \"Demon child.\" \"Gabe.\" Tara said pointedly, \"Behave.\" He chuckled at that, \"Yes m'lady, now lets hurry so we can get this done.\" Tara shook her head and helped him with the rest of the food. \"Can I ask you something?\" she asked as they were done with pancakes. He looked over at her, \"What?\" \"About joining the G's. . .\" she said, coming next to him. He looked at the pancake he had just flipped over, \"You don't want to join, do you?\" \"That's not it. . .I just don't think you should dump Gavin just cause you don't agree with what he did.\" Gabe couldn't believe what he was hearing, \"Tara, you do realize I'm doing because he hurt you, right? And me!\" Tara nodded, and put her hand gently against Gabe's, \"But Gabe, think about it, would it really do anything if he was still in the band. It's not like I expect you two to talk comfortably around each other, but come on, this is just ridiculous. You and Gavin are best friends, and even though he hurt me, I still know you care about him and don't like whats going on with him.\" Gabe cringed, so she could tell he was concerned for Gavin, crap. \"But you mean more to me than him.\" Tara smiled, and put her hand against Gabe's chest, \"Okay, but I've forgiven him. Now's your turn.\" Gabe was alarmed by that, \"When did you forgive him?\" She chuckled, \"The minute I figured out about my feelings for you. I realize now, that if Gavin hadn't done the things he'd done, we wouldn't be here right now. Or at least not as quickly, and a lot more painfully.\" Gabe understood what she meant, but it still infuriated him that Gavin hurt her. :Okay, just give me sometime to let it go. I mean you do not know how much I wanted to kill him for making you cry.\" Tara hugged him, \"It's okay, I am a lot happier now.\" she said staring up at him, he suddenly felt a bolt of happiness strike him, \"Okay.\" and he held onto her, rubbing his forehead against hers. \"But I still want time so I don't get sent to juvie for kicking his butt.\" Tara groaned, \"Gabe, that is not funny.\" \"Than why are you smiling?\" he teased, holding her in his arms. She caressed the side of his face, pushing back some of his messy hair from his fore head, \"Because I'm with you.\" \"Now who is the one being corny.\" he joked, kissing her forehead, and letting her go as Tara's mom came walking in. She looked back and forth between the two, and shook her head, \"Remember, only at school. Sneaky kids.\" she than went over to the coffee pot and poured some coffee into her mug, sitting down. \"Thanks mom.\" Tara mumbled, sitting down furthest away from Gabe, and Gabe didn't look at anyone. He almost seemed. . .ashamed. . .That wasn't Gabe. \"Here Mrs. Adams.\" he said, setting some eggs on a plate next to himself. Mrs. Adams looked sharply at him, \"Thank you, Gabe. . .\" than she took the plate and moved it down to Tara, and sat down. \"Mom!\" Tara seethed, glaring at her. \"What, I like sitting next to you.\" She said, and took a bite of her eggs, \"Thank you Gabrielle.\" She said in a bitter voice. \"You're welcome. . .\" Gabe said, trying to act as if Tara's mom moving away from him didn't sting. So much for trying to win her parents over. . . A/N: Okay, I deserve to be burnt at the stake for taking so long. I'm sorry, there really is no excuse for this one, lol. But I hope you enjoy it like I enjoy writing it. Man, I'm really starting to not like Tara's mom. Reviewers time: Amsparz: You are completely right, she is, but not as much a Tara's mom, lol. Thanks for the review girly! Bethan forever: Out of all the adults, I think Tara's step dad is the most calm, but even he doesn't like the thought of Gabe and Tara being alone. Please like they can even get two seconds alone together, LOL! Don't be sorry! I'm sorry for my long pause on this! I've been writing a lot of other stories besides this one. I will always update on this one whenever I can. I don't stop on my stories even though it seems I have, lol. Happy birthday to your mom even though it was a few months ago, lol! I hope you will forgive me for the long wait. And a horny Gabe is really hot! ;) Poor Tara! All she wants is to date the guy and her parents and his mom are all in the way! Why can't Tara just get a break, huh? :) And I think it's a great song for it too. Animal is great too! Thanks for your wonderful Review! And puppies are the coolest! Guest :Sorry for the bloody cliff hanger, I'm sure you are even more mad about how long it has been for me to update this continuation from the bloody cliff hanger. Mwahahaha! So I converted someone to the side of Tabe, Gabra! MWAHAHAHAHA! Yay! Actually I take that as a really big compliment, so thank you! 3 And thank you for your review, it was beautifully written, especially the \"bloody\" part! Thanks for liking my story! Review if you like, it would mean a lot! Question of the night/or day is: What is your favorite book? Put it in your review below. Mine is: Pride and Prejudice. Love, Justanothergirl~ P.s. And how do you like the new photo cover? I love it a lot, lol. :)[Chapter 9] Gabe grabbed the guitar set to the corner close to the bands drums. \"Hey.\" Gavin said, walking up to him. \"Hey, it's Gavin!\" Gore smiled, looking like and excited little boy whose mom and dad just got back together. Gabe just saluted him and turned to Trevor. \"Ready, in -\" he was interrupted by Gavin, \"Hey, can we talk first?\" Gabe didn't turn, than slowly and surely he moved his head towards Gavin, \"What is it?\" Gavin seemed a little nervous \"Um, it's just -Can we talk in private?\" Gabe sighed and nodded, \"Sure, let's go outside.\" They walked out of the room and Gore and Trevor and Trent looked at each other, \"This isn't going to be good, is it?\" Gore asked in concern, and the band mates just shrugged. Tara walked in right than, shutting the garage door, \"So, what is Gabe and Gavin talking about?\" she asked curiously as she walked to the band mates. They seemed uncomfortable to even try to answer that. \"So, Tara, you are becoming one of the back ground singers, huh?\" Trent asked, wanting to change the subject. \"Yeah, I-I am.\" she smiled, feeling a little shy about singing in front of everyone. \"Well, than, lets hear it!\" Gore grinned, grabbing the microphone cord and plugging it into the amp. \"Here,\" he said in a puppy dog like face, handing her the mic, \"Sing somethin'!\" She took it, but looked uncertain, \"I-I don't know. . .\" Trevor smiled at her and came over to her. \"Will sing with you, don't worry.\" he said , patting her back in comfort. Than they backed up and told her where to stand. They let her sing while they sang back ground. They started with a simple one they all knew. She was pretty good. And when she messed up once or twice, the guys all just laughed it off, saying they confused her since she didn't know the song. She thanked them, than looked over at Gore by the drum set, \"Hey, do you think you could show me something on the drums?\" she asked him, trying to be polite, and not demanding. He nodded, eyes swelling up, \"AWE, Tara, you are the sweetest girl! Wanting to learn how to play with us! It's so sweet!\" Gore practically squealed, running over to hug her, Trevor stopped him, \"Gore, all she wants is to learn is the drums, not a crazy person trying to crush her with his stupid hugs.\" Gore pouted at Trevor, \"Meanie, stop ruining the mood!\" Trent rolled his eyes,\" Gore, shut up, please.\" Trevor laughed, \"What mood? You know she's dating Gabe.\" Gore seemed surprised, and looked at Tara, \"What! Is this true?\" Tara was embarrassed, \"Um, y-yes.\" Gore slugged down, \"Aww! But you are so cute! Why do you have to be Gabe's! Wah!\" Tara gulped, \"Sorry.\" Trent snorted, \"Tara, don't worry about it, Gore's just teasing you. . .mostly. . .\" he smirked, looking like he was trying not to laugh at the situation. \"He's not use to girls actually wanting to be around him so-\" Gore glared at him, \"Hey, I get the ladies, you just never seen it!\" Trevor laughed again, \"Rig-ght, sure you do.\" he let go of Gores tee shirt and went over to his guitar, \"Now you should still be nice and show Tara your mad skills on the drums, Gory.\" Gore seemed fine with that so he showed Tara his basic moves. \"Not gonna happen.\" Gabe said, giving Gavin a look of complete resentment, \"I will not help you get Tara back.\" Gavin nodded, \"I understand why you want too, but I know she doesn't remember what I said, so it should be fine, I just feel so guilty about things the way they ended. . .\" he said, the old Gavin in him shinning through a little. \"No.\" Gabe said sternly. Gavin sighed, not giving up easily, \"Come on, we both know she still has feelings for me, and I could make it work. . .Some how. . .\" Gabe wanted to take him, \"You do know Tara and I are dating, right?\" Gavin was stunned into silence, \"Seriously? She still believes that you are dating?\" Gabe was about to say something, when Tara stepped out, \"What's taking so long out here?\" Gavin quickly went over to her, grabbing her hands,\"Tara, let's get back together, you and I.\" Tara's eyes widened, \"What?\" \"Come on, we had a pretty good thing going on.\" he said, looking like he was trying to mean it. Tara shook her head, \"No, sorry. . .\"She paused, and looked like she had an idea, \"But the reason you want to get back together with me is guilt right?\" she smirked, and looked at Gabe. What had he turned her into? But Gabe smiled anyway, figuring what she was thinking. \"If you really want to make it up to me. . .\" she smiled, \"Become my pretend boyfriend for Gabe and I.\" Gavin seemed like he was trying to calculate everything up, \"Wait. . .do you. . . remember. . . everything?\" She nodded, watching the changing expression of courage turn to guilt, \"Oh. . .What do you want me to do?\" he asked, letting her hands drop. \"Like I said, pretend to be my boyfriend so my parents aren't all up in Gabe and I's face.\" she said, crossing her arms, feeling Gabes proud stare. Gavin glance over at Gabe, \"What have you done with Tara?\" Gabe had to smile at that, \"Nothing, this is how she's always been, didn't you know?\" Gavin didn't seem to buy that, but Gabe knew it was true. Tara didn't give up on things she believed in, and she believed in them, so obviously she'd try and keep her and Gabe together. \"Okay, so you want me to fake out your parents so you and Gabe can get together more?\" \"Yep, pretty much.\" Gabe said, coming up to pat Gavin's shoulder, giving him a harsh look, \"So no kissing or anything like that.\" Tara didn't seem to agree, \"Gabe, we need our parents to believe that we aren't serious about each other, so I think at least a kiss around the parents is okay, right?\" Gabe sighed, and closed his eyes moodily, \"Fine. . .\" Tara came over to him, \"Now, don't worry about anything.\" she teased him, running her fingers through his hair, and kissing him. He smiled and released his hard grip on Gavins shoulder, putting his hands around both sides of her waist, pulling her closer. Gavin rubbed his shoulder. He than looked away, than looked down at his watch, adjusted his sun glasses, and after twenty minutes later Gavin finally couldn't take it anymore, \"Hey, are you guys done kissing yet?\" he tried to ask politely. Gabe pushed his face away, and kept sucking face with her. Gavin decided they weren't even close to finished, so he decided to get into the garage, where everyone was trying to brush up on their music. \"So-o, Gabe and Tara, doesn't freak you out?\" Gore asked, and everyone glared at him, \"Shut up, Gore.\" Trevor growled. Gavin just grinned, \"Nah, it's just weird is all, they're so different.\" Trent nodded at that, \"No kidding. . .\" silence till Gabe and Tara came back in, Gabe wiped his lips and grinned like a lucky boy on Christmas day, \"Let's get back to work.\" Tara nodded, her black beanie slightly starting to come off. Gavin seemed kind of bothered as he went up to the mic, and Tara stood between Gabe and Gavin. \"Okay, one-two-three!\" Gore shouted, and they started. Gabe had taught Tara what she was suppose to sing and when. She looked over at Gabe, smiling, she was having fun. He smiled back and put his hand over hers for a millisecond to give it a gentle squeezing . Than he went back to his guitar. She flushed and looked down at the mic happily. Gavin watched, singing with everyone, it was bugging him watching Tara smile and get all puppy eyed over Gabe like she use to with him. They couldn't be seriously dating, could they?' Gavin thought to himself, as he saw them steal glance's at each other, he wanted to say something, but he just kept singing and trying to look away. Why was Tara so attractive now? Later they all went out to grab some burgers with Gabe's mom, since Tara and Gabe couldn't be alone. Gabe put his arm around Tara, and his mom's disapproved look made hims shrug, \"Were in public with you!\" Becky sighed, picking up a curly fry and shaking her head, smiling, \"Fine.\" Tara leaned her head, relieved, on Gabes shoulder. Gabe smiled, \"Shouldn't we be eating?\" he whispered, nudging his head against her's. She chuckled, pouting, \"No!\" than she released him, but he didn't move his hand away from her's as they both ate their food. \"So, it's kind of nice to have Gavin on our side, huh?\" Gabe asked, which made Tara nodded, than suddenly she realized something. They were suppose to fake break up eventually, \"Hey, we need to stop holding each others hand.\" she said, starting to move her's away when he grasped it tighter. He didn't look straight at her, but whispered, \"They can't see our hands under the table, just pretend we are getting bored of one another.\" She blushed, but tried to cool her face. She thought she'd get over such faze of turning red, but so far she just couldn't help it. She tried her best to look disinterested, and was surprised how well Gabe was pulling it off. It made her a little worried that maybe he really felt that way. Than his thumb caressed the inside of her palm. The way his hand moved against her's showed he wanted to do more, like holding her. But if they wanted to get to even hang around each other alone anymore without practically getting caught, or watched twenty four seven, than they had to hold back. She was relieved to know Gabe was really just acting, and now that she glanced a little more she saw that it looked more like he was trying to hold back, than disinterest. \"So Tara, I heard you singing. I didn't know you could sing.\" Mrs. LaViolet said, turning her eyes on Tara. Tara suddenly felt nervous. \"Oh, yeah. Neither did I.\" she tried to laugh, but it turned out more of a nervous giggle. Mrs. LaViolet stared at the two of them, \"Okay, what's going on, just a minute ago you two where all lovey dovey, now you are both so quite. . .\" Gabe sighed, \"Can't people just sit in quite?\" he asked in a cold voice. Tara could tell he was faking, but his mom seemed shocked, and looked back and forth between them, \"Oh, okay. . .so, did you two hear-\" Becky LaViolet kept talking about anything and everything to try and act as if they weren't behaving strangely. When they got up to leave, Tara and Gabe let go of each others hands, reluctantly on Gabe's side. Gabe walked further away from her, trying to act as though he was distant. Tara looked back at him only once, and understood. She tried her best to not make it look too obvious or that would be. . .well. . .to obvious. Gore smiled and came over to Tara, \"So, how's everything with the radio thing-y you do?\" he seemed like he really wanted to know, his brown puppy dog eyes made Gabe suddenly feel slightly uncomfortable. But he didn't go over to her as she told Gore everything that was happening at her station, and then Trevor dove into the conversation, and Trent along with him. Suddenly all the guys were talking and laughing along with her. Gabe decided it would seem weird if he didn't join in, so he bumped Gore out of the way and stood next to Tara, eyes shifting away from her, though he was closer than any of the others. Tara noticed the change in the plan and looked at him, puzzled as to why he was so close again. Gavin just shook his head in amusement, knowing full well Gabe was jealous, but didn't want to ruin anything. He took this as his chance, and wrapped and arm around her, \"So, when we get fake back together, does that mean we have to fake it all the time, or just when his parents are around?\" Gavin asked her, smiling sweetly, \"I just don't want to get confused half way through.\" Tara stiffened, and nodded. A flush coming upon her face, \"Yeah,only when the 'rent's are around. . .\" Gavin chuckled, and nodded in his boyish way he always did, \"You and Gabe really do hang out a lot, huh?\" Gabe felt like jerking Gavin's hand away, and grabbing Tara's shoulder protectively, saying, \"Yeah, and we know more about each other these few weeks than you ever did in a whole month.\" but he held it back, and cleared his throat instead, still trying to act indifferent in front of his mom. Gavin knew it was getting to him, and he couldn't help but grin, he let go of her, and backed off. Gabe stared over at him when Tara was out of their ear shot, \"Really?\" Gavin just stared ahead of him, \"Yep, really.\" Gabe suddenly didn't feel to good. Gavin was interested again? This had to be a joke. . .right? \"You're such an asshole.\" he growled to Gavin, glaring at the him. \"Whoa, calm down.\" Gavin said, hands up in the air, \"No need to call me names, Gabe.\" Gabe held back his snarky comment, and walked further, \"No, I am sorry for that. But really? You're thinking about taking her back?\" Gavin shrugged his shoulders casually, \"Well, only if I can.\" Gabe just sighed, not wanting to say anything, \"And you really think that's a smart idea, huh?\" Gavin smiled sharply, \"Smarter than her going out with you. I might have hurt her, but I never intend to leave. You, on the other hand, you always ran away from all your other girlfriends that you've ever had. What make's Tara so different, Gabe?\" he asked, his eyes becoming serious. Gabe didn't want his words to sting, but they did. \"It's different with her, I don't know how to explain it, but it just-it just is. . .I'm in love with her.\" he said, and meant every single word of it, \"I-I've never felt this way before. It's different.\" his heart hurt thinking about even the slightest chance of Gavin taking her away. . .Not that she belonged to anyone. She was the most beautiful, independent girl he'd ever seen, yet she was gentle. That was part of his attraction and love for her. He looked at Gavin, \"She deserves the best, and I know that isn't me. . .I make tones of mistakes, and I don't know how to fix 'em, but I want to try and be better for her. I want to become better. . .\" he said, his eyes fixed on her, \"Because she's my someone.\" Gavin stared at his best friend in shock, \"Wow. . .you really mean that, huh?\" but it still wouldn't stop him, he liked Tara too, and he was already better matched for her than Gabe. Gabe had to know Gavin was better for her, he just had too. Gabe just nodded, looking embarrassed, \"Yeah, I do.\" Gavin didn't like this. This Gabe seemed different. He had changed, and for the better. It's like being around Tara made him more aware of peoples feelings, and Tara being around him made her more brave to say what she needed to say. Gabe would have never said sorry about calling him and ass, or held back a few mean things he wanted to say. And Tara would have never felt comfortable singing live in front of everyone, or even taking part in fooling her parents so she and Gabe could hang out more. If Gavin had said anything about stealing one of Gabe's serious girlfriends in the past, he would have gotten a lot of nasty words thrown in his face, and maybe a slap or two, and over dramatic leave, like storming out the door while knocking things down moodily. This was truly weird to Gavin, but he kept it to himself. Friends helped friends change all the time. That's all it was. Gavin could end up helping Tara too! If she let him that is. He cracked a half grin, he had a plan. Later that night Gabe came down to find Tara on the couch in the living room, she looked back at Gabe, and smiled, giving him a wink, than blushed for doing something so unlike herself, \"How's it going.\" He smiled and blew a secret his, \"Pretty good, getting a snack, you want some.\" She pretend to grab it, than put it to her heart. Gabe smiled happily, \"Corny much.\" She chuckled, \"Not nearly.\" than jumped up and grabbed him by his neck, putting her lips quickly against his. \"Mm. I love you.\" he said in a soft voice, his cheeks warming up when he realized he finally had said it to her. She blushed, \"T-thank you. . .\" He smiled, realizing she felt bad, \"Stop, you don't have to say it till you're ready. Never feel sorry.\" she seemed relieved, \"Thank you, Gabe. I really, really like you a lot!\" than she decided it was time for another kiss, and put her lips gently against his once more, than they pressed their foreheads together, lingering in the amazing feeling between them. \"I really do love you. I can't stop saying it!\" he grinned, nuzzling against her neck. She caressed the side of his cheek, \"Don't stop saying it than, ever.\" than they embraced once more, in a lip lock, for a long amount of time till breathless, pulling apart, \"I really need to get that snack. . .\" he groaned, parting from her, her eyes watching hungrliy over at him ,\"Oh, okay. . .\" she said, seeing him go towards the kitchen, knowing he wanted to stay beside her and continue what they had been doing. When he was out of ear shot she laid down, the back of her hand to her cheek to try and cool it down. \"Gabe, you're driving me crazy!\" she moaned, trying not to get carried away by what she wanted, knowing it need to wait when it was mutual feelings of love. A/N: Hey, I'm back, mawahahahahahaha! Anyways I really feel this ones showing more growth towards their relationship, I like-y this chapter. Sorry if it felt like a long time coming. Reviewers time!: Amsparz: Hm, I don't think I've ever heard of ' Impossible', by Nancy Werlin. But I do know of shrinking violet, which the movie is based off. I never did get to read it though. You are certianly not judged, it looks interesting, and I'd want to read it definatly sometime in the future. My library is a small town library, so honestly it kind of doesn't carry too many teen books. Though it does have all the lastest since we've been getting more people since the change of the new librarian. The old librarian was more like quite, shy, Tara, and the new librarian is more like the loud, talkitive Gabe, except without the little bits of bratty, lol. I'm glad it was an awesome chapter! I did enjoy writing it, but probably not as much as this one. :) Okay, question of the day!: Who would you rather date. Gabe, Gavin, or Gore? Personally, I think I'd rather date Gore, I'd probably kill Gabe because we have a lot in common, like tempers. And Gavin is still not exactly on my list of trusting guys just yet, lol. :) R&r;, tell me what you think. Love Justanothergirl~[Chapter 10] Around three in the morning, Gabe heard his little sister walking around his bed to something on his shelf, \"Hey, what do you think you are grabbing from my shelf?\" he asked in a stern, yet groggy, tone. Chloe huffed, crossing her arms \"How'd you hear me?\" He chuckled, going deeper under his covers, \"Because you are the loudest kid in the world. Now go to sleep and stop trying to mess with my stuff, ya demon.\" He muttered, trying to go back to sleep, he ignored her whining till she stopped and went back to her own bed. He shook his head, and looked over to where she slept. Getting up he went to get a drink, and heard something scuffle behind him. He back and saw that the husky puppy was following him, but stopped when Gabe had, and tipped his head, mimicking Gabe. Somehow the dog had gotten out of little Chloe's arms and decided to follow him, \"Are you thirsty too, boy?\" Gabe asked going down and petting the pup. He licked Gabes hand and played with it by catching it and lightly biting it, \"Hey, Rascal. That shoulda been you real name, you demon dog. \"Gabe laughed quietly, playing back by petting his tummy, \"Now come on, let's go get some water.\" Once he got him some water he sat some down in a bowl for the puppy to use, than leaned on the counter, watching the puppy sniff at the water. The puppy didn't seem interested, and instead lifted his leg and peed on the carpet. \"Rascal! Gabe yelled, going to grab some dish towels and when he came back the dog went straight to the water Gabe had poured him, drinking happily. Gabe shook his head, cleaning up the mess with towels, than plugging the sink and putting in some hot water, grabbing the soap, and putting it in. Then turned off the water and dipped in the water, \"Gabe, what's going on in here?\" he turned to his mother, Tara, and her mother. Gabe chuckled nervously, \"Don't look at me, blame that demon dog, he just happened to pee on the floor where you are standing.\" He told them. They'd all come down in slippers so they didn't realize till they all were told. The puppy just howled happily around them, wagging his tail back and forth, not realizing they were upset. \"Bad dog!\" Becky cried, grabbing the jumping puppy, and spanking him. But Gabe detected a hint of amusement on her face even if she was grossed out. \"Well, ladies, I say we get out of these shoes a leave them for Gabe to handle.\" Tara's mom, who wasn't amused at all, gave Gabe a scolding look, and took her slippers off, walking away tiredly, grumbling about the noise. Tara look about ready to laugh, but held it in. His mom winked, got out of her shoes and walked away. He a Tara were alone. Finally. \"So would you tell me why they practically are punishing me?\" he asked in an amused tone. Tara laughed, \" Um, hello, you screamed like someone had just been murdered.\" She laughed, \" I'm surprised the whole house didn't wake up.\" He shrugged, \" Well, by the way your mom acted, there might have been.\" He said sarcastically, \"But why don't we all just admit it, I'm a way better cleaner. \" he said mockingly, looking back at her with a wink. She laughed, \"Whoa cowboy, get off your high horse now.\" \"Only if you get your feet off of where I'm washing, than that is the least I can do for a pretty girl like. . . Wait, where is she?\" Tara glared, \"You idiot.\" She mumbled, getting out of her slippers. She walked over to him, and wrapped her arms around his waist, \"Gabe, I haven't been able to really be alone with you in a week, kiss me already.\" He smirked bitterly, \"Well I thought you liked Gavin's better. Wouldn't want to mess that up by my sloppy seconds.\" She released him, surprised, \"Gabe, you know that is all show, we had to do it to convince our parents.\" Gabe sighed, squeezing the mop head so the water wouldn't drip all over, he then took the mop over with him to the pantry, grabbing an empty bucket. \"Who are we kidding, you and Gavin are meant for each other.\" Gabe said, dropping the bucket to the ground and picking up the slippers, throwing them in the bucket, annoyed, \"I mean it's obvious he wants you back.\" Gabe all but said softly as he mopped the floor thoroughly, passed Tara to dip it back in than rinse it out. She watched him do this two more times. Anger caught up in her chest, \"So you are saying all this time you think I've been using you?\" Gabe paused by the sink he'd just drained, \"Yeah, I do.\" He said, turning to her, \"Maybe you didn't realize you did.\" He looked away from her, \"Sorry, I don't think I want to do this anymore.\" Her anger turned to shock, \"What?!\" He didn't say anything, he just walked to the pantry, putting away the mop, then went past her, grabbing the bucket, heading towards the laundry room. She followed, stung by his words, \"Why are you saying this.\" She cried, \"This isn't fair.\" He looked back at her, and dropped the bucket once more, \"No, Tara, what isn't fair is not having my father alive, what isn't fair is growing up faster than you wanted too. . . What isn't fair is falling in love with someone who has to kiss your best friend because you want to not sneak around, what isn't fair is having to move a thousand so miles because of a great job offer my mom just couldn't refuse!\" he hissed, looking pained, \"That's what the hell isn't fucking fair!\" She didn't seem to move from her spot, her feet were glued to the spot, \"What?\" she asked, a single tear hitting her cheek, \"Gabe, my father. . .He left my mom and me when I was nine, nine, Gabe. He choose his drinking and gambling over my mom and I. Last time I saw him I was fifteen. . .and he came drunk, to the door, asking for money, and trying to freaking hit on me before my mom figured out he was there and called the cops on him. Kissing Gavin is no picnic either. . .He's not you, Gabe.\" She shivered, \"And here's the other thing that isn't fair, that the boy who I love is leaving. I may never see you again!\" she cried, \"You think I've just been sitting back and enjoying the freaking torcher of having you leave?\" Gabe looked at Tara, \"Your dad was an ass.\" He muttered. Tara shook her head, \"He didn't even recognize me, let's stop beating around the bush, he's a bastard.\" She said in a angered tone. Gabe was surprised, but kept quite, \"You never talked about him before.\" He finally said. \"You have this hero of a dad, while mine is just. . .I just felt ashamed.\" She said shakily. He nodded, looking sad. \"Well, knowing your dad was shot in action isn't something you really want to talk about much. . .Neither is figuring out that he'd cheated on your mom most of the time he was over there. . .The girl he'd been with mailed a letter to my mom, saying she'd though she knew they were divorced, she was sorry about her loss, adding she was having my dad's baby. . .\" Tara seemed shocked, \"What, but you are wearing his tags. . .?\" Gabe seemed confused, \"oh, these? They were my grand pa's.\" he said thoughtfully, \"He was in the war when he was a boy. . .He helped my mom with money issues since my father hadn't even been in action long enough, and my father had given part of our house to his girlfriend in his will. Mom didn't want anything to do with my father's money, so she got a job, and moved us to an apartment complex a week later, that was the time my grandfather on my mother's side sent money to help out. . .\" Tara blinked, \"I'm so sorry Gabe!\" \"It's okay, I'd been angry when I figured out a few years later, than realized my mom had hidden papers for their annulment.\" He sigh, coming closer to her, \"I also figured out from my mom that she cheated first. . .So really, I guess The real one I was angry with was my mom.\" \"My mom and I lived in a crappy neighborhood before she married my step dad. I can't tell you how it happened, but I know I've been held at gun point before. That's why my mom looked angry, she was use to trying to keep me safe, she thought you'd been hurt badly. . .\" Gabe's eyes widened, \"Seriously, you got held by gun point?\" Tara nodded, \"But in that kind of neighborhood you figured out how to protect yourself, \"So I elbowed him in the face, kicked his knee, kicked his gun out of his hand and punched him in the gut, than in face. . . Made sure he was knocked out and called the cops.\" She shrugged. He seemed shocked, \"Seriously?\" \"Nope.\" Tara laughed, and Gabe shook his head, \"I didn't punch him in the face, I kicked him in the face.\" She said, watching his reaction. \"What, don't believe me?\" she asked, putting a hand on his chest. He laughed, distracted by her hand, \"No, I do.\" He said softly, grabbing her hand, and kissing it, \"I do.\" She smiled, wrapping her arms around him and whispered \"Kiss me.\" \"Here, now?\" he asked, rubbing her back with his hands. She shook her head, \"No, not here silly, lets sneak out.\"' \"Right now?\" he asked, seeming surprised. \"Yes.\" They got their coats and got the car keys, going outside, Gabe started the car quietly, and they drove around, \"So where do you want to go?\" he asked at a stop sign, thinking food. It was one in the morning, \"It's your birthday, so. . .\" she didn't finish as she climbed on top of Gabe and kissed him thoroughly. She seemed a little nervous, but quickly fumbled with her buttons as she continued making out with him. He pulled away, realizing she was feeling clumsily for his pants, he winced as she accidently hit his private hard with her hand when she slipped a little, \"O- oh my gosh, I-I'm so s-sorry Gabe!\" He nodded, needing a minute as he leaned down and groaned. It wasn't that bad, and eventually they were back to kissing, and touching. This time she was much more careful as she unzipped his pants. He stopped her, and kissed her neck softly, she moaned as he kissed further down then looked up at her, panting, moving her away a little. He looked unsure, \"Do you really want this? I mean, are you ready for this?\" She nodded breathlessly, \"Are you?\" she asked in a whisper. He smiled warmly, \"Yeah, Yeah, I am, shy one.\" She grinned back and caressed his cheek, \"Better put the car in park then.\" She giggled. He laughed, \"True.\" After that, they tilted back the seat, kissing once more, mashing themselves together as close as they could, feeling each other all over, kissing each other all over. Soon the car windows were fogged up. An hour later they heard a honk behind them. They had been snuggling when the dreadful honk went off, Gabe gave the guy the finger, and turned on his windshield wipers, \"Douche could just go around us.\" He said, feeling irritated as Tara went over in her seat with Gabe's shirt on, and her hair all messy. \"Don't bother with him, Gabe, lets go.\" He put the car in drive and smiled over at her, his hair sticking up wildly because of her hands that had tugged gently on the thick hair of his. \"Good thing my hot and bothered was already taken care of, m'lady.\" She blushed and hit his arm playfully \"Shut it, Gabe!\" she laughed, \"Now lets go get something to eat, I'm famished.\" She said, taking off his shirt and grabbing for hers quickly putting it on, then threw his to him, \"This can be the first date we've had in weeks.\" She said, grabbing her bag, a getting out her wallet. \"My treat birthday boy.\" She said, grabbing her pants and underwear that was scattered all over the car. \"Nope. I pay.\" Gabe said, \"I am supposed to be the gentleman in this relationship.\" He laughed, picking his pants up, and searching in his pockets. She shook her head, \"No. I pay or I will not eat any, even if you pay without my consent.\" She said, determined, \"But thanks for the sweet gesture.\" He chuckled, putting his pants on his lap to cover himself, since he was too lazy to put on his boxers, \"Yeah okay.\" \"Thank you.\" She said, \"But choose McDonalds, not made out of money you know.\" She said in a mock tone of Gabe. He snickered, \"Ha ha, real funny.\" He said, poking her side, \"Ya still got fed, right?\" he said sticking his tongue out at her and turning into McDonalds. \"Hello, what would you like to order.\" A tired voice asked. Gabe answered, \"One second.\" And turned to Tara, \"What would you like your cheapskate boyfriend to order you?\" he asked teasingly. Tara studied the menu in a mocking face of Gabe, \"Whatever the cheapest, babe, whatever's the cheapest! Do I seem rich to ya?\" she teased, than quickly added , \"Chicken nuggets with ranch, ten piece please, five ranches, large fries, large coke, and a resses mcflurry on the side, extra resses, please.\" He laughed and ordered her everything she asked. Than ordered a plain hamburger, small coke, a small fries. \"'Gabe order a mcflurry too, you are the birthday boy after all, and get another hamburger!\" she ordered him, \"Or I'll waste all my food.. . because I'll feel bad you aren't ordering enough for yourself!\" He laughed, \"Girl, you are crazy.\" Than he obeyed her, getting m&m; mcflurry, and another hamburger. Once she handed him the exact change they drove to the second window. They both gasped when Audrey handed the their food, \"Gabe, . . . Tara!\" Audrey yelped, not believing her eyes. She notice Gabes pants and Tara's messy hair straight away, \"You guys. . . Oh my-\" Tara shushed her, \"A-Audrey, I can explain!\" But Audrey surprised her by squealing, \"Oh my gosh, Tara!\" You and Gabe!\" Oh wow, that is so romantic!\" she said, jumping up and down in excitement, \"You have to tell me everything!\" Gabe rolled his eyes and grabbed his food, \"Why? You that desperate to join or something.\" He asked sarcastically, and saw Tara's glare of disapproval of his snippy behavior. \"I mean, she will surly tell you later, but It's my b-day so she wants to spend time alone with her gabby!\" he said, mocking her now. She tried not to smile, and punched him softly in the arm. Audrey nodded excitedly, not even noticing Gabe's rude behavior to her, \"But of course, Heres you drinks!\" she said hyperliy, and Gabe suddenly realized that the reason everyone there must have been tired. Not because it was almost three in the morning. Oh no, it was because of crazy people like Tara's friend. She was making Gabe tired. Once they got away, Tara burst out laughing, \"I love her, but she really is crazy!\" \"Yeah, Tell her to lay off the energy drinks maybe?\" he laughed, kissing Tara's hand. \"Lets eat at the park?\" \"Okay.\" She said quietly, kissing his hand back, \"Gabe!\" He nodded, seeming as emotional as she was, \"Do you really have to go?\" she asked, and overwhelming dread plunging at her, she couldn't stand this. His voice cracked as if he were crying to, but for some reason she couldn't look at his face, but felt something wet hit her hand, \"Yeah, m'lady, I do. . .\" A/N: Sorry this has taken so long. I was kind of stuck on where I was gonna go with this, so I made sure to get it all down! I love Gabe in this one as much as Tara. But don't worry something will happen! Awesome reviewer time!: Bethanforever: No worries, don't over work yourself! Gabe and Gavin on good times, Hm. . . Gabe doesn't seem to think so, and I can't really say I blame him! ? Tara is a very cunning girl I tell you! Lol! Updated! Harry Potter is amazing! And the ghost and the goth I haven't read in along time! Good choices! .7: thanks for the review, helped me realize how long I'd not updated! Hope you enjoy this chapter! J Okay, question of the day: What place is your favorite restaurant to eat at breakfast time? Mine is Dunckin dounts, or Krispy Kreme's. I[Chapter 11] Five years later. Gabe walked thorough the train stasion, luggage in hand, as he wheeled one by handle, and the other wrapped around his shoulder. He was wearing his blue dress shirt, sleeves rolled up, with a brown tie, tied loosely around his collar, and light brown, almost pale, slacks. He pushed past the crowd exiting the station. Heading outside, he stopped next to a bench where Gavin had arranged to pick him up. A half hour later he started to wonder where his friend was. Grumbling to himself, he looked at his silver scratched up watch to see the time. 3:30. \"Damn traffic jams.\" He sighed. Gabe hated waiting in places like these, where every person passing by was in a flipping happy mood, and getting picked up by their loved ones that they hadn't seen in years. Gabe hated it because he knew he'd never had that with his dad. But mostly just because he had a migraine. \"Wonder why he so late. His girlfriend couldn't be the reason for this delay, could it?\" Gave mumbled, leaning on his arm and resting his head against his hand, leaning into a impatient posture as the minutes ticked by on his watch. \"What could he and that girl be doing that is taking them so long-?\" Gabe paused, and shuddered at that thought. Relaxing. He hadn't thought about Tara in a whole week, he wasn't going to start now. . .But it had been a good thing he had moved with his mom to Japan, he never figured he'd have a shot in the dark to go to another country, so it was fun learning the different culture. But other than that, the only thing he really missed had been Tara. But now, it had been so long since he'd seen her, that he only thought of their couple of months together fondly. . . And now she had moved on, so he was fine. But he had had to find a job and save up just to fly back over here to go to collage on scholarship. So what if he had to practically beg Gavin five years ago , who surprisingly was assigned to the same room with him, to help with food so he could save up for certain types of writing books. He had graduated with honors. He had made it in to journalism, he had eventually paid Gavin back, and by a miracle he had landed a even better news journalist job right here in Chicago. So you could say he'd grown up. And found he liked journalism just as much as music. And ever since his band split up after their concert at the school five years ago, playing guitar and singing hadn't exactly been the same since. Not that he didn't love writing music or playing like he use to, it just wasn't the same without the G's. It was more like a fun and even passionate hobby on the side. He had even given some recent work to a big record label company that he sold to for a lot of money. Not that the money mattered, but it was nice to have. He felt he wasn't letting his songs shine. And even felt weirdly emotional when he released them over to Darth Records. \"My babies! I know they'll take good care of you!\" He had said, in which got an eye roll from the head recording mangers assistent, as he handed them to her. \" I entrust you to treat that evelope carefully! Don't crinkle it. Might hurt em!\" He put in for dramatic effect. \"Wouldn't dream of it.\" The nasally voice said with dripping sarcasm, as she folded it in half and put it her pocket. Gabe gasped, mostly kidding, but the small part of him worried about the paper getting mangled up. Gabe grinned at the memory of hearing one of his song months later playing on a radio station in his car to work. Than his mind shifted back to Tara. And to Gavin. And to them moving on. . . He inhaled, and exhaled. He didn't care anymore. \"HEY! Gabe! I'm sorry it took so long. Told my girlfriend here to hurry up and stop lathering on her make up, as if she were trying to impress you, or something!\" Gavin laughed, coming up to where Gabe was, \"Here let me take your bags.\" Gabe nodded bitterly, but Gavin didn't seem to notice as he took his bags and put it in the back of his car. Tara peered out her window at Gabe, she looked different, but not makeup wise, in which she was wearing none. She wore a white tank top underneath a loose white chiffon dress shirt. Her hair in a stylish bun. Her only bangs were the loose strains that fell from the side of her face. She stepped out, and her black skirt quickly caught his attention. Tara, in a skirt. . .This was not the girl he remembered with her jeans and hoodie. \"Hi.\" She said simply, seeming nervous, her brown doe eyes still as beautiful to him as the day they'd met when they were little, and her pinkish lips slightly parted, catching him off guard with a sensation to ki-. He cleared his throat and nodded, \"Yeah. Hi.\" But he was still not over what she had done to him. She was just like he remembered her, Personality wise anyway, when they'd first argued outside the school halls. Shy. But it was different. To be honest, it did hurt him to see her with Gavin once again, but it had been five years. . .They hadn't talked in five whole freaking years. And though she looked different, nothing about her had changed, except for how close they had been, and her clothes. But now it was different with him. He couldn't even look her in the eye. He just kept shifting his to anywhere but her face. He thought he could forgive her by now, but it was hopeless. What she'd done was unforgiveable. \" I thought you would like to sit up by Gavin.\" She said softly, looking down at her feet and Gabe could almost swear he heard her defeat in her tone. He looked at her, snapping back \" If you don't mind. Wouldn't want to take you away from your boyfriend.\" Tara knew it had double meaning in what he said, and it struck her heart, \"Please, you wouldn't be taking him away from me \" she said, than quickly passed him, accidently bumping her hand with his, and getting into the back seat. He tightened his hand into a fist to try and stop the electricity that ran through him by her touch. He had gotten to her by his comment, and yet an awful taste came to his mouth as though he just said something he didn't want to. . .weird. \"Alrighty, let's get going!\" Gavin smiled, patting Gabe on the back, \" So, where do you wanna go for lunch?\" Gabe smirked, \"Let's just head to your place, we can pick some grocery's up if you don't have any.\" Gabe said determinedly, \"I'm making supper.\" Gavin agreed to his terms, \"But Tara has food at her apartment. Why don't we just go there?\" Gabe was genuinely surprised, \"Tara can't cook.\" Gavin shook his head, \"What are you talking about, \"Tara is a chef, she owns her own little diner or something. Don't you sweetie pie.\" Tara cringed at that Nick name. \"Actually it's a restaurant.\" She replied back. \" I kinda decided to try out more lessons in cooking and stayed up practicing at night. Then when I had home ec I passed through with waving colors. Started cooking and baking a lot more, and ended up making it into a culinary school, five years later and here I am.\" She said quickly. \"What about becoming a radio hostess?\" Gabe asked, looking back at her subconsciously, forgetting he was wanting to ignore her. \"Oh. . . I still do that on the side.\" She said, scratching her neck awkwardly. \"Oh.\" He replied, realizing he was carrying conversation with her. \" And I am your famous boyfriend musician. \" Gavin bragged. Gabe chuckled, \"Yeah, so how much did you get for singing to my little sister on her fourteenth birthday party, did mom give you a tip?\" Gabe asked jokingly. His mom had moved back to the US after her five years working for a company that ended up screwing up In his mom's face. She eventually found a job to make his siblings life comfortable. \"Hey, Your little sister and her new friends love me. I'm like an Idol in their eyes.\" Gavin joked, pulling up to apartments, \"Okay, whatever you like to say.\" Tara said casually, only half listening as she checked a text from Audrey. Getting out they headed up to the apartment. Gabe paused to look at where they were, he looked surprised, than grinned as they went in. Once outside of her door Gabe chuckled. \"Guess I can barrow things from you when I need to.\" Gabe told Tara with his killer snarkiness, and smirk as he leaned in against the wall. Tara and Gavin were confused as. \"What are you talking about.\" Gabe laughed, and thrust his thumb the opposite direction of her door to the 15th door, \"This door leads to my apartment, surprised? Because I am.\" \"What?!\" Tara and Gavin exclaimed. \" This true. Poor you shy one.\" Gabe jestered with a wicked smile. \" Now what's for supper?\" A/N: Dear reader, do not kill me. I know it is short, but I'll be writing more soon, so no fear! Lol! Bear with me if you can, you saintly readers! Awesome reviewer time, you know who you are!: Amspraz: I know they are all cray cray!

Lol. THANKS FOR THE REVIEWS, YOU AWESOME REVIEWerS YOU! I'm hungry. . . Blue eye beast93[Chapter 12] Gabe watched as Tara and Gavin kissed each other good night, leaning against the wall. He groaned inwardly as they said good bye, and Gavin turned around to him like a happy puppy, wiping off of his mouth. Gabe felt a sudden urge to just leave him in the hall way and not invite him into his new apartment. But he stood tall, and looked back at Gavin with a certain mixture of a smug and saddened grin. \"Well, wanna come in?\" he asked wearily. Gavin shook his head, \"Nah, you need some sleep man. I'll catch up with you again in the morning, okay?\" Gabe nodded, and fist pumped Gavin and gave him a side hug. The fact that Gavin had changed was the only reason He and Gabe were still so close. Because of all the crap that he'd put him and Tara through, Gavin had finally gotten around an realized what an asshole he was, asking forgiveness and proving through action that he was worthy of Tara once again. Gabe snickered, and brushed his hand through his thick short hair once Gavin was out of sight. Gabe was officially beat, after making sure all his stuff had been moved here by mail, he had to see his friend and ex-girlfriend cuddle it up the whole entire time through supper, actually Gavin was the one trying to cuddle up as Tara shrugged him off. Which would have been absolutely emotionally exhausting, if Audrey, Tara's best friend, hadn't been there to talk to. It had actually been pretty nice to see her again, and even though she wasn't as crazy as she was when she was a teenager, she still was just as chatty. Gabe heard the door behind him open, and turned around to see Audrey leaving, Tara stood out with her, hugging her good bye. \"I'll see ya at work, boss!\" Audrey smiled, walking away to the elevator. \"See ya.\", Tara told her, smiling and waving. Tara turned back to go back inside when she paused by Gabe staring at her, half turned, key in his lock. She breathed in deeply, feeling lightheaded. They stared at each other in silence for a moment or so, before Gabe said, while ducking his head down , his eyes out of her eyesight, \"Good night, Tara.\" in a hushed tone, opened his door, and went inside his apartment before she could even make a reply. \"Good night, Gabe. . .\" she shivered, closing her eyes and rubbing her forehead as if embarrassed. The next morning Tara got up, getting ready, and pulling her hair up in a casual bun, grabbing her Black and off-white diamond color dress, and heading for her bathroom when her phone rang. She looked down at it ans sighed. \"Phone, decline call.\" she ordered to her phone. It obeyed. It rang once more as she was brushing her teeth, \"Phone decline call and shut off.\" she said between spitting out her tooth paste. It obeyed, and once she was done beautifying and changing, she ran out the door, grabbing her purse and keys for her car and restaurant. Once out the door she ran down the stairs, getting a little out of breath from running to her car that was outside. What she did not expect was rain when she started outside, she ran quickly back in, and shuddered, wiping away some of the water that had fallen on her. \"Hey.\" Gabe said behind her, smirking, \"Looks like you caught some of the rain, huh?\" he asked, coming beside her, \"Here, use my umbrella. I don't really need it.\" said a full grown Gabe. She turned to him, \"Huh, oh, thanks. . .\" she murmured , grabbing it, and walking away from him out the door. He chuckled, and put his hand in his pocket, pushing his foot on the door before it shut, and pushing it open, heading out behind her, \"So, you cook, I don't know if I can believe that.\" he joked, the journalist coming out in him, \"How long have you actually been in the culinary business, hm?\" Tara, turn slightly towards him, blinking, \"Um, not that long, for about two years now. . .\" Gabe seemed impressed, \"And where is this place located, what's the name?\" Tara blushed, and turned around to him, \"Um, it's a small normal sized restaurant, around two blocks from here, named . . .Gabrielle's place. . .\" Gabe felt a jolt of his nerves jumping from her words. \"Oh.\" was all he could say in reply. \"Interesting choice. . .\" \"Yeah. . .I-I thought the name would be a good idea, s-since you pretty much helped me realize my love for cooking. . .no matter how much I sucked at first. . .\" she than told him good bye, thanked him for the umbrella and left in her car, screeching her car out of the parking lot. Gabe stood, watching her depart, he pulled out of his deep thought of her, and unlocked his car, starting it up, and wiping up the wet hair from his forehead, \" Well I didn't see that coming.\" he sighed, hitting his head gently against his steering wheel, \"Why did I start another freaking conversation with that woman?!\" but deep down he knew why. He had been in love with her, but he thought after five years, those feeling would have gone away? He was tired of it already. He sighed once more, got up and started his car, driving out of the parking lot. \"Just great. . .Ugh.\" A new job was great, but no one seemed to realize his existence once in the offices of his new work place. Gabe's boss started him with wanting Gabe to go and review a few places. Boring stuff that he hadn't been asked to do in a long time. But he understood it was just a certain routine that he was suppose to follow to prove he could report the stories he was asked to. Fortunately, he knew if there were people who didn't see a story that he knew would make big on the front page, he could get that story for himself. He smirked in mock at the guy in a gray suit, gray tie and gray slacks, walking with his black, most likely expensive, leather shoes. Gabe chuckled. He could tell the type anywhere. Played by the rules, slicked his raven hair back to look like a grease monkey, which the guy probably thought he looked presentable and handsome. Ugh, the dude oozed with over confidence that even Gabe couldn't, and wouldn't want to beat. the man was tan, most likely by a tanning lotion, or machine, and his pearly whites could hurt any blind mans eyes. \"Hello! Gabe LaViolet?\" the man asked, giving a show host smile, and holding out his hand for Gabe to shake. Gabe looked at the small hand, and than backed up at him, \"Uh, yeah, that's me. And who may you be?\" Gabe asked, shaking the guy's hand firmly. \"Larry Bradly, at your service.\" Larry said, snapping his fingers in the air. A nerdy looking guy, with gray, thick glasses, and puny body type ran up to Bradly, \"Yes, Mr. Bradly?\" said the nerdy boy. Bradly smiled knowingly at Gabe, making Gabe want to gag. He had nothing in common with this jerk, and he would never want too either. \"Get me a large mocha latte from Star bucks, and get Mr. LaVioillet the same. Well, what are you waiting for? Move!\" Gabe smirked in disgust at Larry Bradly, \"I'll tag along with you.\" he told Bradly's assistant, \"You don't have a car, do you.\" he asked the startled assistant, \"So we'll just use mine.\" As they left, Gabe could hear the disappointed sigh of Larry Bradly, \"The guy must be a loser, he's heading out with Kent.\" Gabe had seen the Kent guy's reaction to what his supposed boss said. \"Your last name is Kent. That's awesome, man!\" Gabe had said, cheering up the puny man, \"Y-yes I suppose it is.\" \"So where's the cape?\" \"At the dry cleaners,\" Kent guy joked, with a nerdy giggle, \"It's got a few stains on it!\" Gabe chuckled, \"So why do you put up with that guy? It's not like he's really your boss?\" Kent shook his head, \"Now he is, but he does like to use my assistants for useless things, like coffee runs. . . I'm actually the photographer on the side too.\" Gabe nodded, \"I heard you guys were on short staff for photographers.\" Kent seemed surprised, \"You actually kept track of that, most the guys that work here don't even know yet because they don't check the daily e-mails I send on what has been happening around the office.\" Gabe snorted, not believing what he was hearing. That was just bad. . ., \"Seriously, they don't? And they're suppose to be working here?\" \"Yeah, tell me about it. That's why most of what we've been publishing have been photo taken by local citizens at the time of the reports, or not use any photo's at all.\" Gabe shook his head, \"That is just sad. . .I understand not always checking, but never?\" \"Tell me about it!\" Kent scoffed, looking annoyed as well. \"I don't mean to be a jerk about any of it, but they need to hire more photographers besides me. . .I'm getting beat running around from one place to another.\" \"Sounds to me they are holding off as much time as they can in hiring new photographers so they don't spend as much in the budget.\" \"The cut some of Larry Bradly's earnings, and we'd have enough for the photographers. . .It just sucks being the guy who is getting coffee not getting any breaks, and having to run everywhere for more than one person. . .\" Gabe understood, \"Yeah, I use to have your job, and it did suck big time. Thing is, you gotta stand up for yourself, say what you see that needs done, try to help make it happen. See things no one else thinks matters. Cause more likely than not, it always does.\" Gabe said, tapping his chin and he started up his car. Kent seemed to soak everything in that he said. \"You were really an errand boy?\" Gabe nodded, \"Oh yeah. I was till I got a job as a full time reporter, because I took a stand and wrote my first column. Took me a while to convince the boss, but he saw that hard work I put into my stories, and eventually helped me on my way.\" Kent seemed discouraged, \"That sounds nothing like our boss. . .He's a real hard nose. . .Can't talk him through anything. . .\" Gabe felt a burst of laughter bubbling through, \"Than be the harder nose! They need you, and if you leave they'll have to hire another photographer, and with how busy this place is, they wouldn't want ta waste the time doing that. And if I remember correctly, you are Mr. Bradly's assistant, not everyone else's. Only work under Bradly, no one else or you'll never prove that you can be a real reporter if you let people walk all over you.\" he said, opening his door, \"Get in. I'll drive.\" Kent shook his head, \"N-no, I'll drive, you take passenger seat, LaViolet.\" Gabe grinned, and shook his head, \"Okay, but remember, we're trying to not have you over work yourself, kid. But nice job, anyway.\" Kent smiled, and Gabe became curious, \"So, what's your name, name?\" \"Clark.\" Clark Kent said, clearing his throat, as if embarrassed. Gabe was surprised, laughing \"Wait, seriously? You've got to be joking?\" Kent shook his head, \"Nope, unfortunately not. It's truly Clark Kent. . .My parents really loved Superman comics and movies. . .\" Gabe laughed, \"That's freakin' epic, Kent!\" he said, putting his seat belt on, \"But be careful, and don't scratch my baby!\" Kent seemed amused, \"But this car is kind of already mashed up pretty good, what did you do to this thing?\" \"Got my stories.\" Gabe said coolly, laying his feet up on the dash board, and resting his head on the passenger head rest, \"Now lets go get some of Bradly's coffee and spit in it.\" \"Already on it!\" Kent said in an enthusiastic voice, pulling out and driving speedily down the road. \"Whoa, ever heard of 'The Tortoise and the Hare.' Well, with police around, even though you are passing these tortoises, you will end up losing, slow it kid, no wonder you ride a bike. . .Damn.\" Kent blushed, and slowed down, \"Sorry, I get a little carried away when I drive.\" \"You're telling me. About rammed that guy back there, didn't seem to pleased.\" Gabe joked, but saw the guy catching back up with them, after they'd slowed down. To Gabe's shock it was Gavin, who shook his head disapprovingly at Gabe and Clark. Gabe grinned, \"Good job.\" he said proudly to Clark, \"Next, slowly pull into his lain a little, than pull back, just to freak him out!\" Gabe said in a snicker,. . . joking . . .of course. \"What?\" \"Friend of mine we're driving beside, wave hi.\" Gabe laughed, and Gavin still seemed pretty peeved off as they stopped at a stop light with Kent waving. \"He doesn't look to happy with us!\" Clark squeaked, putting his hand down. \"Nah, Gavin's just a mood killer in general.\" Gabe said as Gavin turned right on red. \"Oh, okay, got it.\" Kent said, turning to go through a parking lot with a Star bucks drive through. Tara opened up the kitchens large fridge, having already unlocked everything, she was starting with the classic Italian Pizza she'd made last week. Getting through with making the dough, she cut the tomatoes, fresh basil leafs and slices of buffalo cheese. Dabbing her hands in flour, and sprinkling some on top of the pizza, she started kneading the bread. Back and forth, up and down. She heard the door behind her open , and in came Audrey, \"Hey, so why is your phone turned off?\" she asked, looking a little peeved. Tara groaned, and wiped her forehead with her upper arm, \"Because my mother has been trying to call me since yesterday.\" Tara confessed, \"And I'm pretty sure it's about Gabe, though I wouldn't know why? What happened between us ended years ago. . .\" Tara murmured, not really believing herself fully either. \"Whoa, in the forty minutes you've been here, have you made five pizza's?\" Tara sighed, feeling annoyed, \"Yes, it's are special today, remember?\" \"Is it really?!\" Audrey asked in surprise. Tara smiled softly, \"What is it you want to know, Audrey? I love you dearly, but you are a health nut, you take care of the finances, not the restaurants food.\" Everything was silent for a few moments, \"Did you tell him?\" Tara stiffened, than resumed her work, going a little quicker than before, \"No, no I didn't. And I'm with Gavin now anyways.\" \"Tara, I love you an everything, but I saw the way you looked at him tonight.\" \"It doesn't matter. Gavin earned my trust. . .Gabe. . .I just don't know if I ever trusted him.\" Tara said, a tear drop falling into her work. \"Tara. . .\" Audrey spoke softly, placing a hand on her shoulder. Tara squirmed away from her grip, \"No. . .Audrey, . . .just no.\" Audrey looked down and sighed herself, \"Girl, you do not have feelings for Gavin, you only ever liked the idea of him, and seeing Gabe lase night, and the way you two looked at one another-\" \"Stop, just stop, please.\" Tara said in a whisper, \"I'm tired of talking about it. He didn't care and I-I'm over that.\" \"Tara, you know your mom-\" \"I need to get back to making these pizza's. Go.\" Tara said, stiffing up again as she placed another pizza out of the oven. Audrey shook her head, \"I can't believe you didn't even tell him.\" than walked out the kitchen door, while Tara watched her leave. She wouldn't cry! No, no! She wouldn't! But as she leaned against the counter, she heard a slight whimper as tears flowed down. She quickly ushered them away with her hands, and went right back to work. Couple hours later and with all the chefs in the kitchen and all the waiters and waitresses serving, and bringing in orders and making orders, Tara stood and that cash register, and passed lunch time they had a load of costumers coming and going. \"Hello. Table for four please.\" said a voice that sounded like a tv host. \"That's Bradly! Larry Bradly.\" Tara wished to roll her eyes, but just took a deep aggravated breathe. This guy was in here way to much hitting on Audrey all the time. \"Hello, yes, Maggie, can you take them to their table?\" Tara asked the slightly older waitress, who guided Bradly and his crew. Weird, Tara had only seen three. A few minutes later Gabe came walking up, looking a little flustered, \"Hey. . .Um, I'm with the Larry Bradly. . .\" he said, staring at her. She hadn't been looking up at him, but she knew his voice instantly, looking up in surprise, \"Gabe!\" He chuckled, scratching his neck, \"I- yeah.\" was all he said. Tara's face went completely red. Why was she acting like a teenager, \"Y-yes, o-of course, let me lead you to th-them!\" she said, not meeting his eyes again, she walked towards him, \"Over here.\" she said, as he followed behind her. She was so jumbled by his surprise visit, she nearly tumbled over one of her employees. \"Oh, s-sorry. See, good grip. Why I hired you!\" she joked with Franklin, who just gave her a smile and went on his way. She saw the amusement twinkle in Gabe's eye, though he was trying to hide his snicker by biting his lip. \"Here we are.\" she said evenly, as she stood beside Bradly's table, \"Sir.\" she added for effect. Leaving, he took a hold of her arm lightly to stop her, \"So, nice place. Love the name.\" She nodded, feeling her entire arm grow warm at his touch. It felt so good, feeling him again, even just his fingers wrapped around her arm sent a shiver up her spine that Gavin could never give her. She missed this feeling, but managed to pull away of a guilty thought of Gavin seeing them, though Gavin never visited her restaurant anyway. \"I'll send a waiter over.\" She told them, \"Our special today is the Italian pizza, Queen Margherita.\" she said, walking away as Gabe watched her leave. A/N: I am seriously happy I got this done in a normal-ish amount of time! Woo hoo! Awesome Reviewer time: Chemical-Rayne: Gavin isn't that bad, just a mood killer, lol. It'll get better, I have a plan! I'm sorry to upset, but I hope you keep reading! :) I'm sorry, I'm a meanie, lol. Oh and sorry about killing your soul and everything! Didn't mean too, lol! Sorry about spurring the last chapter on you guys like that, maybe I should of warned you? heehee? R&r; if you like! Love ya all! Blue eye beast (Hearts, hearts, hearts 3) Again, don't kill me! Ya! lol[Chapter 13] Tara waited by the school buses and watched as a brown-haired, with brown doe eyes, boy jumped off with his friends. Lagging his pack back behind him, his smirk meant trouble, not that his mother would have noticed. She smiled, \"Ethan Gabrielle Adam's! My baby!\" She teased grabbing her little five-year old in her arms and hugging him, spinning him around. \"Mom! Put me down! How embarrassing! You know my middle name is girly!\" He cried, but smiled back at her, \"I missed you too!\" he whispered so his friends wouldn't hear. She put him down with a grin. He was too smart for his own good as he looked casually around him, as if he wasn't unhappy or happy to see her. \"Sorry, I forgot.\" she said, ruffling his hair as he gave her a grin, \"How was your field trip with the boys?\" \"Great, but Hilary Swan tried to give me cooties! It was disgusting. . .So I-I pushed her. . .\" he gulped, looking away as if he thought it would help his case to act like he'd said nothing. Tara's gasped, she held him back to make sure she'd heard him right, her eyes bulging out \"What?! You did what?!\" \"She was all over me, ma! So I decided to push her! You'd totally understand, if you were there! She wouldn't leave me alone, ma! All the guys laughed at me and called me a baby! I don't like being called a baby, those jerks!\" he said, his big teary eyes staring into hers. She groaned and closed her eyes in frustration, as she tried to think of what to say. Why was her son always getting into so much trouble lately? \"Ethan, How many times do we have to go to the principles office before you realize you need to control your temper and let things slide when they annoy you?\" Crossing his arms in a moody way, he blew his bangs out of his face, and scrunched his nose up as if smelling something gross, \"I didn't do nothin' though!\" She sighed, feeling a headache coming on, \"Really, Ethan? Because it seems Mr. Terrence disagrees-\" \"Well, you can't please everyone, ma!\" he said stubbornly as she grabbed his hand, walking over to his teacher. \"We will talk about this later, got that, we do not behave this way young man!\" She said in a firm tone. He rolled his eyes, a blew out a sigh, \"Just great.\" Gabe smirked, lifting his head to watch as Gavin came tumbling over drunkenly towards him, \"Just great. I have to take care of the smelly Gavin? Where the heck is Tara? It's way to early in the morning for this. . .\" Gabe yawned, trying to grab Gavin to take him over to Tara's. After a few knocks it was obvious that either 1. she was dead or 2. she was dead asleep or 3. she was out for a morning jog, or 4, she was abducted by aliens\"That can't be it? She hates exercise. . . but aliens. . .maybe-\" Gavin told him where she was in a slur of words that Gabe could barely put together, \"So she's out to get some sun. . .Hm, that's nice. . .\" But that wasn't the Tara he quite remembered. \"Hey, Gavin?!\" A voice cried, walking up the stairs to Gabe's floor. \"Audrey, are you the reason he is knocking on my door?\" Audrey nodded, \"He called me from a party of his, supposedly there were two different punches. One with booze and one without.\" she said, grabbing Gavin by his collar, \"And by the smell of his breath, I'm guessing you may know which one he had, which he claims was by accident.\" Gabe chuckled, and patted her on the back, \"Sure it was! Just as much as it was our freshman night of college. . .hm?\" \"It twas!\" Gavin declared, throwing both hands up in the air. Gabe was exiting when he stopped in tracks to what Audrey said next to Gavin. \"Now, now! You know Tara's sons gonna be here any-\" Audrey gasped, clamping her hand against her mouth, her eyes shooting to Gabe's back, hoping he hadn't heard her. Gabe's turned to face her in utter surprise \"Son? Tara has a son? That was the \"Son\" that Gavin meant?\" Audrey looked surprised, \"You don't know about Ethan?\" \"When? When did this happen?\" Gabe demanded, looking at her in as calm a way as he could, \"How-how old is he?\" It all seemed to click to Audrey in the instance, \"You, you didn't know. . .?\" \"He's five. . .isn't he?\" Gabe asked, feeling his whole world spinning as he leaned against the wall. \" Yeah. . . he is. . .\" Audrey shuffled and looked over at Gabe curiously, \"You mean you didn't get Tara's message left on your phone?\" \"I thought it got ruined the day I got to Japan and so I decided to get new service there, changed my phone number. I-I was going to message her about it. . . but things didn't go very well with my internet. . .\" \"But she left a message on your phone. How could she leave a message if you canceled that plan?\" \"My ma got rid of it for me. . .She said a couple of days later that it was working after I'd already gotten my new one, so I loaned it to her. . .Crap. . .\" \"Well, then the text message break up over her phone makes a lot more sense now. . .\" \"That's why I never got a word from her? Why she blocked and deleted me from everything? She thought I didn't want the-the baby? The baby I didn't even know I had because my mother kept it from me?!\" Audrey's features filled with pain, \"Gabe, she had tried calling you a million times over the phone. She didn't feel comfortable talking over the internet. She got your mom. . .Your mom told her to stop trying to contact you, that you didn't want to talk to her. That you needed to get into college and you couldn't have any distractions. . .\" Gabe felt anger flare, as he held his keys tightly in the fist of his hand, \"Really? So that's what happened. . .\" They heard a sound of little feet and bigger running up the stairs together, as they got to the top, Gabe turned around with a heart stopping realization on his face. A boy? His boy? A boy who was his son? His hair. Her eyes. The little smile. Her nose. His mischievous gleaming eyes. . . Gabe's breathe hitched. . .This was all too real way too fast. . . Tara met his gaze, her face turned from happy to pain,\"Gabe?\" One word. How could her saying one word make him so upset. \"Whose that, ma?\" asked the boy curiously, looking back and forth between the two pale faces. \"This-this is Gabe, Ethan, our new next door neighbour.\" \"Lucky! I have a middle name! It's Gabrielle! I wish It was short like Gabe!\" he said, talking quickly to him with shiny eyes, \"Do you like macaroni and cheese with hot dog? It's my most favourite food in the world! What's your most favourite food, Gabe?\" Gabe just stared for a second, than changed to a nervous half grin, \"Well, I like pretty much everything. . .\" \"Yeah, me too, but what's your favourite?!\" \"Ham cheese sandwiches. . .I like ham cheese sandwiches.\" he told him, \"So, your name is Ethan, huh? Ethan, I need to talk to your mom for a minute, would that be okay with you?\" Ethan shrugged, \"It'll cost ya.\" Gabe chuckled, \"Here, take this.\" he handed his a pen and note-book, \"Draw a story.\" Ethan groaned, \"I'm only a kid, you really think I could be much of a story-teller.\" he said with a shake of his head, \"I want candy.\" Gabe blinked, \"Candy?\" \"Yeah, I figure cash will become more appealing once I'm older, ya know.\" Gabe blinked once more, \"Uh, here, have this.\" he said, grabbing the sucker the post office lady had given him that he stuffed in his pocket, \"Tis chocolate.\" \"Cool! Thanks!\" He said, taking off the wrapper as Gabe grabbed Tara's arm and took her into his apartment, \"Stay with aunt Audrey till we're done talking, okay Ethan?\" Tara said in her protective mama voice. \"Kay, I will.\" he said, looking over at Audrey, \"Why is uncle Gavin passed out? Hey, do you have anything we can throw in his mouth while he's sleeping?\" Gabe shut the door behind them, turning to her, his eyes flashing confusion, \"You-I. . .Why didn't I? I. . .\" \"What do you need? Can this hurry? I need to make my son his dinner.\" she said sternly, tucking her hair behind her ear, and pulling her arm out of his grasp. He felt angry, \"I never knew I had a son. . .\" Tara seemed to catch his confusion, \"What? What do you mean you didn't know?\" \"I mean. . . I only figured out about this from Audrey. . . \" Tara paused, something in her stance showed she was angry with him, \"How could you not possibly know? I left you dozens of messages. I wrote to you. I even sent you a message through e-mail. . .So explain to me how you couldn't possibly know?\" \"I don't have an e-mail, Tara.\" Gabe said heatedly, pacing back and forth. \"I don't understand?\" Tara said, seeing in his face that he was telling her the truth, \"How could you not have known?! You still could've contacted me!\" she screamed, tears welling in her eyes, \"You never tried! Never!\" He looked back at her, needles of pain settling in his stomach, \"Tara, you broke up with me. I remember. You told me, through a letter that you sent to Japan.\" \"What? I did no such thing Gabe!\" she said, pointing her finger at him, shaking as though her heart was breaking all over again, \"You never called, you never wrote me! You never texted me, except for to tell me it was over! You cad! You broke my heart and made me feel completely alone without any help for five years! I have sworn to hate you all these five years! I have sworn never to think of you ever again, and then you just had to come back, didn't you, you selfish ass! Saying that you have no idea what I'm talking about! That it was someone else entirely! That you never knew about Ethan!\" Gabe watch her as she wiped away her tears, wrapping her arms around herself as though to protect her heart as he inched closer \" You've got to believe me, Tara, I never knew!\" he said, taking her and, and wiping the tear rolling down her cheek, \"I'm so sorry.\" he said softly, caressing her face, \"If I had, I would have come back. If I knew everything, I would have been there when you had needed me!\" he soothed as he scooped her in his arms, kissing the top of her head, \"I'm so sorry. I should have known, Damn it! I shoulda known!\" She laid her head against his chest, absorbing his warmth, and inhaling the smell of peppermint and coffee that tickled under her nose. She gently pushed him away, staring up at him. She'd missed gazing at him. Missed his embrace. Missed his sarcastic behaviour. Missed his nicknames. Missed his lips gently pressing against hers. Missed the longing of his eyes. Missed everything. But as his face inched closer to hers she moved back, getting away before he could kiss her, \"I've got to go. . .We'll talk about this later, okay?\" He nodded, looking like he was embarrassed, \"Yeah. . .\" he was speechless as she walked away. Couple of minutes ago outside in the hall. \"Hey, why did Gabe take her into there? That's not her there!\" Gavin pouted, pointing a accusatory finger, \"Jow will I know which room fifteen to open? There are three and they're all spinning. Sigh, woe is me!\" Audrey rolled her eyes \"And they say I'm the drama queen.\", settling down beside him as Ethan played with her gameboy, she bumped her arm against Gavin's, \"I don't think you should, since you can't even stand.\" she chuckled, handing him a cup of coffee, \"Remember that I was going to give you this to help with your drunkenness?\" He stared at it, then glared at her, \"Then stop swirling two of them in my face. . .that's just mean Audrey\" he sighed, laying his head against her shoulder. She laughed, \"Just drink it silly boy!\" She said, steadying his hand, putting the cup there for him to hold. \"Thanks.\" he murmured, as she helped him drink from it. \"You are truly the first man-child that I never expected to be a man-child!\" she laughed,slapping his back and leaning back against the wall, \"Gabe, Gabe I expected, but Gavin, saint Gavin? Now that's just a riot.\" Both of them jumped to Tara yelling, which soon calmed down. \"Wonder wat's going on in there?\" he pondered, starting to steadily stand an wobble back and forth. Audrey grabbed his arm, \"No, no, no! You. Sit.\" \"What? Nah, I'm good!\" he said stumbling back down, \"I'm just gonna check on Tara-\" he mumbled before he fell asleep against her again. Audrey shook her head and smiled at him, \"You do that crazy good boy.\" she said, wrapping her coat around him, then standing up as Tara came out. She saw Tara's face and knew what she needed next, \"Hey, I got some cookies and nutella out in my car, I'll be right in.\" Tara thanked her. \"Hey mom, I got a Charzard!\" Ethan giggled, coming up beside her, \"Look, it's so cool!\" \"It really is, isn't it. Now let's get inside and get ready.\" She said. \"Hey, Gabe, you want some of the moms awesome pancakes? We make it from scratch!\" Ethan said in excitement. Tara turned back to see Gabe standing in the door way, watching them, \"Um, some other time. . .I've got a lot of things to do. . .\" Gabe said, giving Ethan a smile, and holding out his hand for Ethan to take, \"It's nice meeting you, kid. You're lucky to have such a cool mom.\" he said. Ethan grinned and ran over to him, giving him a hug instead, \"It's good to meet you too! Ma told me about how you and her use to be friends. You're the reason for my horrible middle name. \" he grinned, running back to his mom. \"Oh,\" he said turning to a blank faced Gabe, \"And if you hurt my ma, I'll hurt your face!\" then he giggled, running into the open door of Tara's apartment. Tara gasped, \"ETHAN ADAMS!\" she shouted, going in, then turning with sympathy on her face to an amused Gabe, \"S-sorry. . .\" she sighed, than shut the door behind her . \"If I had needed anymore proof he is my son, that should do it. . .\" he laughed, but still felt mildly annoyed and upset, \"Damn.\" Audrey stood beside him and nodded, \"defiantly, your son, no doubt about it.\" Gabe looked over at Gavin, \"So, what are we gonna do about that drunken idiot?\" Gavin laid on the floor with his mouth open, snorting and mumbling things in his sleep. \"Can I leave him with you?\" Audrey asked with a pleading look, seeming like she'd already had enough of drunk Gavin for a day, \"Please?!\" \"Sorry, can't. I've got to head to the office today for my latest assignment so he's all yours.\" Gabe chuckled, heading into his apartment before she could complain and shutting the door behind him. \"I've got a mother to deal with anyway.\" he growled, sitting down on his apartment couch and grabbing his phone, he grabbed a box from under where he was sitting. Setting it on his lap he opened the lid and grabbing Tara's letter that his hands had crumbled and un-crumpled about a thousand times in the hopes of a different result of words, \"Who would've sent me this than?\" he pondered, pulling up his leg to rest on the other one, \"I'll get down to the bottom of this, even if it kills me.\" Later that night Tara opened the door for Audrey to come in, \"Hey.\" \"So you told him you knew, right?\" Audrey asked, holding a bowl of cookies in her arms. \"No. . . I didn't think now was the right time, not after today.\" \"You'll have to tell him eventually.\" \"I know.\" \"You figured out what your mom did.\" \"Lets just not talk and pop in the movie. I already set the popcorn and licorice out.\" \"It just makes more sense now, that's all. . .How could she-\" \"Audrey, stop.\" Audrey sighed, and put in pillow talk, and sat down beside her,\"Fine.\" \"Rock Hudson really is the man of my dreams.\" \"Yeah, in your dreams.\" Tara joked, throwing a mini butter finger at her. \"Hey, it is so on!\" she laughed, throwing so licorice back at Tara. \"Shut it you two, I've got school tomorrow!\" \"No hon, it's Sunday tomorrow, meaning church with Grams and Gramps.\" \"Well, then what am I doin' in my room?\" \"Go to sleep.\" \"Fi-ne.\" He huffed, heading back to his room. \"Thank you sweetie.\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Night ma!\" She heard him grumble back. Tara sighed with a grin towards Audrey, \"Fine, you can watch the movie with us. But you gotta be laying down, and only two pieces of candy and no popcorn.\" \"YAY!\" Ethan yelled, running out to join them. \"Silly kid.\" Tara chuckled, making sure he was laying down properly and had only the exact amount of candy she given him, \"You're too much like your dad.\" A/N: Woot woot, I finished. Sorry for the long wait. Hope you enjoy this chapter. I enjoyed writing it. Now for Awesome reviewer time: Chemical-Rayne: LOL, no worries, sorry I haven't written a chapter in a while but I will be trying to become better with updating, lol! I'm so happy you felt the same as me about Gabe. One of the main reasons I wanted them to happen was because of how totally opposites they are and how awesome of chemistry I think they'd have, haha. Don't worry, I like pickles, especially dill. :D ;)Thanks for your awesome review! You're right, Audrey's the only sane one at the moment! :) Saloni98: Honestly I don't know why they're is always food being mentioned or made, it just kinda became a almost traditional thing for me to write for this fanfic. I guess to me it the only way I could see Gabe open up to Tara, about part of who he was, is somewhere he's comfortable, and somewhere comfortable for him turned out to be a kitchen for my story, lol. Or maybe I could only see him showing his vulnerable sides to her where he could just be himself and it escalated from there, lol! Hope you enjoy this chapter even though it took so long to put up. Sorry 'bout that! :D Amspraz: I cannot tell you, but I'm guessing you may already know. :D I'm glad you were surprised, I was wanting that kind of reaction, lol. :) I'm kinda hoping this one will be the same as well, lol! EmmALewisS: I think I know which chapter you're referring to. :) Sorry if it freaked you out. If I ever have that happen again, which I probably won't, but just in case, I will leave a warning, lol! I'm glad you came back, hopefully you come back again! XD To all readers: I like to know what people think it helps my brain to think through everything and opinions coming from different people really help me get creative, so thank you all for your reviews! R&R; if you don't mind! Love Blue eye beast 93 :D Have a beautiful day, week and life. ","Summary":" 'Oh gosh The girl is a dork!

And I've decided to write a fanfic on it. This is a Gabe/OC, just throwing that our there if you hadn't already guessed. Also this is the first story where I've used the new-person-speaking-new-line strategy so please be nice. Anyway link to what the OC looks like is on my profile, other than that enjoy the story and review if you can. \"This is your Radio Rebel, live from the underground. You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. Because I'm one of you\" I turned up the volume on my radio and listened intently. Everyone at school looked up to Radio Rebel in some way, she encouraged us to do what we wanted without caring about what other people though. It didn't matter that no one knew who she was, she was inspirational to me and my friends. \"Report cards came out today. I got a minus for participation, you can't give me a minus for being who I am. So, since grades are being handed out I think I should give all of us at Lincoln Bay High an 'F' for labelling each other. Jocks, outcasts, dorks, queen B's and their fellow pops. And new born pops. Guys these aren't who we really are, there was a time when being different was a good thing. Now those differences just divide us, you deserve to embrace your awesomeness, embrace who you are. Reject the status quo, I dare you\" I smiled at her words but sighed \"If only it was that easy\" I muttered staring down at my rather difficult Math homework. A lot of us would love to stand up for ourselves, speak up to the higher people. But if we did there was a large risk of embarrassment, and detention. Everything Radio Rebel talked about made sense and she definitely knew how our school social system worked. But like I said, if only it was that easy. I opened my locker and sighed as I grabbed my books for the day. I hadn't gotten much sleep last night and it was definitely effecting me today \"Okay, last night Radio Rebel...\" Audrey started while taking the bright red lollipop out of her mouth. \"Was Awesome?\" Tara asked knowingly. I smiled and closed my locker before turning to face my best friends. \"As usual. Reject the status quo is my new life motto, she's so inspiring so...herself\" Audrey exclaimed before sucking on the lollipop. \"I wish I could be more like her\" Tara sighed in thought. \"You should talk to your step-dad\" I suggested shrugging. Her eyes widened. \"What. Why?\" \"Uh...he runs Slam FM the biggest Radio Station in Seattle. Maybe he could give you an internship, that would be a confidence booster right?\" Audrey asked seeing where I was going with my suggestion. \"Are you kidding me? He's been married to my mom for two months, and he probably thinks I'm a total step-freak. I freak out when he asks what kind of cereal I want\" Tara replied shuddering. Audrey closed her own locker and we started to head for class \"I just wish I could talk to everyone the way I talk to you guys. I guess that's why you're my BFF's\" she added. \"BFFTLEWE\" Audrey corrected. We gave her questioning looks \"Best friends for totally like ever without exception\" she explained. \"Catchy\" I shrugged. \"You need a relaxation technique. When I'm rehearsing lines for drama I imagine I'm breathing in the words\" Audrey said. We once again gave her questioning looks. \"Audrey, what does that even mean?\" Tara asked with narrowed eyes. Audrey cleared her throat before taking a very deep breath \"You need to breathe your words\" she exhaled the words in a very freaky way. \"How can you even breathe at a time like this!\" Barry exclaimed popping up behind us with his twin. I rolled my eyes and chuckled. The boys were very nice but...eccentric. They were twins but fraternal, though despite that fact they always asked us if they looked identical. It was quite amusing really. \"Problem Barry?\" I asked hugging my books tighter to my chest. \"Last night, Radio Rebel revealed the biggest clue yet about her identity. She goes to our school\" he replied over-dramatically as we walked towards the elevator. \"She mentioned it and then at 14:30 in Tuesday nights podcast\" Larry told us as we all entered the elevator. \"You guys have way too much free time\" I remarked giggling. \"Yeah, obsessed much Larry?\" Audrey added. \"Obsessed? Please I would hardly describe myself as obsessive\" he exclaimed. We all nodded and watched as he wiped an elevator button with a hand wipe before pushing it. \"What? It's flu season\" he said defensively as the doors closed. We nodded and the lift began to rise \"It's so exciting, she's actually one of us\" he said as we exited the elevator. As we started walking the twins started to point out different girls that they thought might be Radio Rebel. I personally though they were both insane. \"No dude, Radio Rebel is like 5ft 6 to me and has red hair. Like Tara's\" he said gesturing to our painfully shy friend. \"No she's nothing like Tara\" Barry replied shaking his head. \"Hey! What's that supposed to mean?\" she asked sounding slightly offended. I didn't blame her. \"Oh we love you...but you're nothing like Radio Rebel who's definitely a blonde\" he said turning to his brother. I rolled my eyes. \"And you know this how?\" Larry asked curiously. \"Radio Rebel is my soul-mate. We're connected for example I also got a minus in participation\" Barry said in a 'duh' tone. \"How can that be you never shut up\" His brother exclaimed. They once again started to argue so I averted my gaze to something else. Unfortunately everything was the same here, nothing really every changed. Stacey and her 'friends' tormented any student that passed them, which I found strange as she'd actually been on the receiving end of it once. And I knew more than anyone how she felt about it, yet here she was doing what was done to her. \"Guys, how do we reject the status quo when the status quo is...status quo\" Tara said in thought. I glanced to see they were all watching Stacey talk some crap about a guys head being too 'pointy'. \"Like Radio Rebel said 'Be ourselves'\" Audrey declared. I tilted my head and watched in horror as she walked towards Stacey. This confrontation would not end well, I would know. They all followed and I stayed where I was for a few minutes. I sighed having a mental argument with myself before finally catching up to them. \"Please, like I would ever encourage people like you to talk to us\" Stacey snapped as I reached the group. \"Ah ha! So you admit you listen to her\" Larry exclaimed as though he'd cracked some sort of code. \"This one's staring at me. Make it stop\" Stacey's friend said nervously as Barry stared straight into her eyes. \"Please don't stand so close to us\" Stacey said before turning back to her texting. \"You and I aren't any different. Like Radio Rebel said...\" Audrey paused as Stacey held up a finger. \"No words. You don't think we're different? Watch and learn. Principal Moreno!\" Stacey called. The principal walked our way and I inwardly groaned. \"Stacey. Is everything alright over here?\" she asked curiously. Stacey sighed. \"Actually no. Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some podcast in class, of course I said no\" \"What? No...I mean I never...\" Audrey stuttered turning to our Principal. \"You know that there's an anti-distraction policy. Let me see your bag\" Moreno said. Audrey huffed and reluctantly let Moreno take her radio \"You too young lady hand it over\" Moreno held her hand out to Tara who did the same without question \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention Stacey\" she said before walking away. I rolled my eyes. \"Get it now? Your little DJ hero doesn't know what she's talking about\" Stacey said smugly \"Oh! Does her royal shy-ness wanna say something?\" I turned my head to see Tara struggling to speak. She obviously wanted to defend both her friend and herself, but wasn't able to. I placed a hand against my chest and ran a thumb over my necklace, a nervous habit I suppose. \"I thought not\" Stacey shrugged before walked away with her posse. \"At least your tried\" I reassured turning to Tara. She nodded with a sad expression and we headed to class.[Chapter 2] I sat down in my usual seat at the back of the class and pulled out my notebook. Unlike Tara and Audrey I had chosen Music class instead of English and Drama. They were both really good classes but I enjoyed music more. Despite leaving the G's I still loved to sing, even if it wasn't with my friends. But the G's was in the past now, and I had to concentrate on the future...no matter how hard it was. \"Alright class, your attention please\" Mrs Davies called. She was a middle aged woman and was very good at singing, and playing a lot of instruments \"So, you'll probably be mad about this. But it's project time\" The whole class groaned in annoyance, including me. We loved music of course, but like every other class in this school. We hated projects. To us it was just homework, very difficult homework. \"I know, I know. But I think you'll enjoy this one\" she said smiling. I seriously doubted that. \"No offence. But why would we enjoy this project? We hated all the others why's this any different?\" Gabe asked leaning back in his seat. He had somehow turned into the class douche. \"Because Mr La-violet...\" she started while giving him a quick glare \"The project is to sing a cover of your favourite song\" she announced. The class suddenly cheered and I smiled in amusement \"Okay okay, settle down\" the class slowly quieted \"You have 3 weeks to choose a song. And then you will perform this song in front of the class in the auditorium. You can pair up if you want to\" \"Thank god\" I exclaimed turning to face my partner...Lisa. \"I know, so you wanna partner up? I mean two's easier than one right?\" she shrugged. I nodded in agreement. \"Sure. So you wanna come over tonight? The sooner we get started the better\" I suggested. \"Yeah. I already have a song in mind, but I'll bring my I-pod over tonight and we'll listen to a whole bunch. Then we'll finally narrow it down to the best song, I really wanna get an 'A' Gabby. My parents have been pestering me more than ever\" she rolled her eyes. \"Yikes. Well don't worry, with our combined voices we're sure to get a high mark\" I reassured. She smiled and nodded. The bell rang signalling the end of class and I stuffed the notepad into my bag. Lisa wasn't coming over until about 5:00 so I had time to get home and relax. But apparently god had planned something different for me \"Uh...hey Gabriella\" I tensed at the voice and slowly looked up. \"Gabe. Can I help you with something?\" I asked licking my lips nervously. I hadn't spoken to him for about 3 months now. \"Yeah, you wanna be my partner? I mean you know how amazing our voices are combined\" he shrugged crossing his arms. I sighed and shook my head \"Can't, sorry. I'm partnering with Lisa, so you're just gonna have to sing with one of the G's. Or you could go solo, you always loved that best remember?\" I asked my tone snappish. He rolled his eyes. \"That was a long time ago Gabby, c'mon times have changed\" he said taking a few steps forward until we were inches apart. I pulled my bag up onto my shoulder. \"But you haven't, say 'Hi' to the other G's for me\" I shrugged before heading for the door. I was sat at home in my bedroom, staring down at my notepad. I wanted to sing with Gabe more than anything, but I couldn't let what he did go. He'd become a total douche and that was one of the reasons I left the band. But I did miss them...and him. \"Okay, so here's my list\" Lisa said handing me her notepad. I nodded and handed her mine. \"Wow. All these songs are so good, how do we choose just one?\" I asked shaking my head. I sighed and let the notepad drop onto my pillows. \"I don't know. Hey how about this one\" she exclaimed shuffling closer. I looked closer to where she was pointing. The song was one of my favourites, but weather or not we could pull it off...was something completely different. It required a lot of high and low notes, but in my mind we could do it. Although I was quite confident when it came to my voice. \"You know what? I think we could do it. You could play the piano, because you're amazing at the piano. And we could both sing, but we just have to figure out who sings which line\" I said excitedly. She nodded in thought. \"I think you should start off, I mean you're the best singer in our class. Well apart from Gabe\" she said grimacing as she said his name. I chuckled. \"Thanks. At least we have a song now, you could get the piano version right?\" I asked hopefully. She nodded and shrugged. \"Leave all that to me. You just figure out who's singing what, you're best at that\" \"Sounds good. Hey you wanna listen to Radio Rebel?\" I asked gesturing to my laptop. She nodded eagerly and I soon found the website. \"I love her, she's so inspiring it's unbelievable. I wish I was more like her\" she said staring at the laptop screen in thought. I nodded. \"Yeah, me too\" I sighed. I shook my head out of the thought before starting on my list. I was with Tara and Audrey the next day in gym class. We were supposed to be playing soccer with the other girls, but Tara was explaining her situation. She had been crushing on my former band mate...Gavin. And since the English and Drama classes had combined, she was now forced to speak to him and Stacey. They'd been paired up and I actually felt very sorry for her. She couldn't speak to anyone except us and the twins, but now she had to talk to the school bitch and her crush...and I thought my week was rough. \"Look at least you talking to him, for you that's major progress\" Audrey pointed out. I nodded. \"I barely got two words out\" Tara replied frustratedly. \"Look, why don't both of you come to my house tonight. I'll teach the extended hyena pose I invented, and we'll listen to Radio Rebel\" Audrey said. I nodded and Tara sighed \"I can't\" \"What do you mean? It's Radio Rebels first show on Slam FM do you realise how epic that is I mean she was popular before but now it's like the whole world will be listening. Including us\" Audrey shrugged. \"I have plans\" Tara replied in thought. \"What plans?\" I asked curiously. \"Family plans\" Both Audrey and I could tell she was lying. She wasn't the best at it. \"You are the worst liar. You sound just like you did when you said you liked that haircut I got at the mall\" Audrey said knowingly. \"It wasn't that bad\" Tara said slightly nervous. \"It was mullet adjacent. Tell me what you're hiding or I'll start screaming in three seconds\" she threatened. We stopped walking and faced Audrey. \"What? No...\" Tara begged. \"3...2...1...\" Audrey screamed as loud. I flinched and covered her mouth with my hand silencing her \"Well?\" she said staring at Tara. \"I'm sorry, I can't tell you\" Tara sighed. I tilted my head slightly. \"I thought we were your BFFTLE's\" Audrey said a little hurt. \"Without exception\" Tara replied shaking her head. \"Then why don't you trust us?\" I asked also a little offended. Tara walked away hiding her face and I sighed. She was definitely hiding something from us, I just didn't know what. But if the secret was that important to her, then I wouldn't push it.[Chapter 3] I was sat down with the group at lunch on Audrey's right. She had turned her back to Larry, Tara and Barry as she was still mad with Tara. I however was completely over it and talking like normal, but Audrey had a history of being over-dramatic about things. \"Gavin three o'clock\" Tara whispered. I turned my head to see Gavin walk out of the school followed by Gabe. \"Your three o'clock or my three o'clock?\" Barry asked looking around. I rolled my eyes. \"We have the same three o'clock\" Tara pointed out. I suddenly noticed Gavin walking towards us and so did Tara, her eyes widened \"Oh no he's coming over here what do I do?\" Audrey huffed and turned her head. \"For the record this is why you don't ice your friends out, talk to him\" she replied before turning back around. Gavin reached our table and he rested his palms flat on the edge while looking at Tara \"Hey Tara, what's up?\" he greeted. She smiled but struggled to release any words \"So do you wanna run lines this weekend?\" he asked. She shrugged and nodded \"Or we could mime the lines if you're not feeling particularly talky\" he offered. \"Mime...talky...yeah...\" Tara shuffled towards Barry and he jumped out of the seat \"I have to...go...me...now\" she climbed out of the seat before speed-walking away. I shook my head in disbelief and Audrey chased after her. \"Um...okay\" Gavin said awkwardly. He was about to head back to his table when he suddenly noticed me \"Hey Gabby. It's been a while\" he greeted smiling. I nodded and got to my feet before quickly hugging him \"Yeah. How's things?\" I asked pulling back. He shrugged. \"They're okay I guess. Things are...different, without you around\" he admitted shrugging. I nodded and sighed while crossing my arms. \"Yeah well, I couldn't handle it. Or him\" I replied nervously. I hadn't spoken to the boys much and I felt a little guilty about it. He nodded in understanding. \"Hey Gavin! You sitting over there or over here?\" Both our heads turned to see the rest of the G's watching us. I rolled my eyes. \"You should get back to him, he doesn't have much patience. I would know\" I said shrugging. He chuckled and nodded. \"Yeah, hey why don't you sit with us? For old times sake\" he said. I paused before finally shaking my head. \"I don't think that's a good idea\" \"Oh c'mon. Please, he won't do anything stupid I promise\" he drew and X over his chest in a promise motion. I sighed. \"Fine. But I swear one idiotic remark and I'm outta there\" I warned. He nodded and I nervously followed him towards the table. \"Finally\" Gabe sighed as Gavin sat down next to him. I stood there awkwardly with my arms crossed. \"Sit down Gabby, we don't bite me\" Gavin exclaimed amusedly. I sighed and sat down on his left. \"What's she doing here? She left the band remember?\" Gabe said slightly annoyed. \"I invited her, she's still my friend. Right guys?\" Gavin asked turning to the other two G members. They shrugged and nodded, I could tell Gabe was pissed. \"Fine. I guess she can stay\" he muttered digging into his food. I rolled my eyes and faced the other two. The bell rang signalling the end of lunch, but I found myself not wanting to leave. I'd started talking to the boys eventually and soon enough even Gabe joined, it was like nothing had happened. It felt like I was still in the band with them, and I knew now that I missed these boys more than I let on. \"I gotta go guys, but it was nice talking to you. I'll see you round I guess\" I said picking up my backpack. I stood from the bench and headed into the school, but after a few seconds I felt someone take my hand. I jumped and spun around to see Gabe, I sighed and tilted my head \"What?\" He shrugged \"Be my partner for Music class, c'mon you know we're awesome together\" he begged. I sighed frustratedly. \"No. I just think it would be really awkward, with what happened. And besides I promised Lisa I'd be her partner\" I exclaimed shrugging. He rolled his eyes. \"Lisa? I'm a way better singer than Lisa, you know that. We'd get an 'A' for sure, maybe we could also sort some problems out\" he shrugged hopefully. \"Who says I want to sort our problems out? I don't want anything to do with you anymore, we are done\" I replied firmly. His eyebrows raised. \"We're done? No we're not\" I narrowed my eyes and crossed my arms. \"What the fuck are you talking about? I dumped you and I say we're over\" I exclaimed angrily. He smirked and placed both hands against the wall either side of my head. Trapping me between him and the wall. \"No we're over I get that. But if we're done, then why are you still wearing the necklace I bought you?\" he asked cockily. I sighed and reached my hand up, once again running my thumb over the 'G' symbol of my necklace. He'd bought if for me about 2 weeks before I broke up with him. I hadn't taken it off since, not even when we finished. \"Because it was the best thing in our relationship\" I retorted. The smirk fell from his face and he backed away. \"Fine, keep lying to yourself. But I know the truth, and you do too. I'll see you round Gabb's\" he said angrily before storming away. I sighed and shook my head before heading to my class. I was in my bedroom, staring down at one of my favourite photos. It had been taken a very long time ago, 3 months to be exact. It was in my living room, on my favourite spot of the couch...and there was a really good reason for that. It was a photo of me and Gabe, back when we were going out. He was sat behind me with his arms around my waist and head on my shoulder. I was leaning back on his chest with my arms outstretched, from where I aimed the camera our way. I sighed and shook my head before turning on the radio. It was Radio Rebels first show on Slam FM and I was quite excited about it. Instead of only our school listening, it was all of Seattle. Now everyone could see how inspirational she was. \"This is Radio Rebel live from Slam Fm. Listen I gotta confess, moving the show from my bedroom to Slam studios was a bit terrifying for me. But life's all about change right? Maybe some people just wanna label you as one thing. We don't have to let that stop us from being who we wanna be. Like that kid with the remote control car, maybe he's gonna grow up and invent the first all green rocket ship. And that girl who gives everyone carnations on valentines day just so no one feels left out, maybe she'll grow up to be president. Guys if we just drop the labels, cliques and be ourselves. We have no idea what we're capable of. Okay if you're with me on this wear red tomorrow. It'll be like saying, despite our differences we're in this together. This next song is from Red Letter Day\" The song blasted through my radio and I smiled in thought, I was definitely wearing red tomorrow.[Chapter 4] I walked down the hall with Tara and looked around in awe. There was not one person that wasn't wearing red, it was amazing. All because one person asked them to, I was one of those people. And so was Tara. \"Ehem, like my glasses?\" We both turned to see Audrey wearing red glasses. \"But you have freakishly good vision\" Tara said with a confused expression. Audrey shrugged. \"Fashion shouldn't be functional\" she explained showing us that the glasses didn't have lenses \"Do you know why I picked red rims? I assume you do because of your red shirt\" she said looking at Tara. \"I can't believe all these people are wearing red just because Radio Rebel told them to\" Tara said in thought. \"So you did listen to Radio Rebel last night? What happened to your mystery plans?\" Audrey asked angrily. I tilted my head at Tara, also curious. \"Can you tell us apart?\" I looked to see Larry and Barry in the elevator, both wearing the exact same thing. \"You guys are fraternal not identical\" Audrey exclaimed before storming into the elevator. I sighed and followed her. The doors closed and the lift headed up. Soon enough they re-opened and we all walked out, with Audrey hanging at the back. She seemed pretty upset with Tara and I was around the same. She was our best friend, but she obviously didn't wanna hang out with us or something. Kind of made me sad, and it made Audrey very annoyed. \"We just ran a recording of Radio Rebel's show through a voice analysis app. We're closer than ever to uncovering her true identity\" Barry told us. \"Picture it, the Cole twins crack Radio Rebels ID\" Larry added excitedly. \"If we do then I'll be able to profess my undying love\" \"We'll be famous. We could get a reward or at least our own reality TV show\" \"Where she and I could be married on live TV\" They both paused before turning to Tara \"Tara since your step-dad runs Slam FM maybe you could help us out\" Barry said hopefully. \"I'm not allowed to go to Slam FM while she's there. To keep the mystery mysterious\" she replied apologetically. \"The truth is, Tara doesn't have time to do friend related things\" Audrey snapped. She started to walk away and I sighed before following her. \"Audrey...Audrey...Audrey!\" Tara called chasing after us. We both turned to face her. \"What?\" Audrey asked impatiently. Tara struggled to say anything and Audrey shook her head \"You know what? Forget it I'm leaving\" Tara grabbed Audrey's arm and turned her around. She closed the classroom door we were next to and turned to us \"I'm about to tell you both something so top secret you have to promise never to repeat it to anyone\" She said. We both nodded eagerly \"We won't tell anyone I swear. You can say it\" I said drawing an X over my chest. Tara coughed while mumbling something and I rolled my eyes \"Tara remember, you have to breathe your words\" Audrey exclaimed. Tara muttered something but we still couldn't hear \"Tara, louder. Breathe your words\" Audrey instructed. \"I'm Radio Rebel\" She finally said. My eyes widened and Audrey nodded. \"Oh, I don't believe you\" Audrey said shrugging. I nodded in agreement. \"Yeah me neither, sorry Tara but you don't seem that confident to be running a radio show\" I replied apologetically. She sighed. \"Fine, if you both come to my house after school then I'll prove to you. I swear I'm not lying\" Tara said shaking her head. Audrey and I both nodded. \"Okay, sure\" Audrey sighed shrugging. Tara nodded and we all headed to class. Audrey and I stood in Tara's room watching her log onto her laptop. She'd handed us a headset while she wore another. She really wanted to prove to us that she was Radio Rebel, but like in school...I didn't believe her. \"If you're like me and believe music can change the world one track at a time, you're gonna love this track from my new favourite band\" Tara was the one speaking right now, but Radio Rebels voice played through the headset speakers. \"Oh my god\" I exclaimed my eyes wide in disbelief. \"I know, I can't believe she's you or you're her. I mean you're the last person I'd expect to be Radio Rebel Tara\" Audrey admitted. I nodded. \"It's been driving me crazy not telling you both, and of course I've wanted to hang out but I've been doing the show. Here's the thing you can't tell anyone not even Larry and Barry because Slam wants to keep it this big secret and so do I\" Tara shrugged. Audrey squealed excitedly and pulled her into a tight hug \"I'm sorry I didn't believe you\" \"Me too. And I'd love to stay but my mom wants be home, apparently I have a visitor\" I said staring down at my phone in confusion. \"Alright, and remember don't tell anyone\" Tara said slightly pleading. I nodded in understanding and hugged them both before leaving the house. As I walked up the path towards my house I noticed a familiar car parked in the driveway. I shook my head in disbelief and groaned, he couldn't have been at my house...it was going way too far. I rolled my eyes and sighed before taking out my keys and opening the front door. I kicked off my heels and dumped my backpack onto the banister before entering the living room, my eyes widened. \"Hi sweetheart, your friend called\" My mom said gesturing to the figure on my couch. I nodded. \"I know. I noticed his car on the way up...mom can you give us a minute?\" I asked hopefully. She nodded and smiled before exiting the room. \"Hey Gabb's, your house still looks the same\" he remarked. I mutely sat down next to him on the couch. \"What are you doing here, Gabe? Why are you talking to me now? It's been about 3 months and if I remember you didn't wanna speak to me ever again. So why the fuck are you talking to me?\" I asked angrily. He was bringing back old emotions for me and I didn't like it. \"First of all, I'm here because we need to talk. Second, that's related to the first. And third, again related to the first\" he shrugged leaning back against the couch. I rolled my eyes. \"Just talk, I really don't have the energy to fight with you\" I replied pulling my legs up onto the couch. \"Fine. I miss you and I want you back in the band. I also want you to partner with me in music instead of Lisa. Is that too much to talk about?\" he asked in disbelief. \"Don't do this to me\" I whined falling onto my back. I threw my arms over my eyes hoping to block out everything that was currently happening...it didn't work. \"Either we talk or I never leave. And I don't think your mom would mind, she seems to like me\" he said smugly. I sat up straight and nodded. \"Yeah, has ever since she met you. Can you at least let me think about your offer? Don't make me choose now when I'm not thinking straight\" I begged shaking my head. \"Alright. I'll give you two days, and think everything over Gabb's. Especially the me an' you part\" he said rising to his feet. I nodded. \"Okay. I will, just don't pressure me about it. And you have to promise that whatever I decide, you'll be okay with it\" I said crossing my arms and also standing. He nodded and drew an X on his chest. \"Promise. So I'll see you in music class?\" he asked hopefully. I smiled and nodded. \"Sure. See you tomorrow\" I shrugged as we walked towards the front door. He slowly opened it before turning to me. \"Hug? For old times sake?\" he asked innocently. I rolled my eyes in amusement but wrapped my arms around his neck. \"Now go, I got stuff to do\" I said pulling back. He nodded and winked before heading towards his car. I giggled and bit my lip as I closed the front door.[Chapter 5] It was Thursday afternoon and I'd just gotten home from school. I was in my bedroom, my homework dumped in the middle of my bed. I quickly logged onto my laptop and clicked onto the 'Radio Rebel' website, music flooded through my laptop speakers and I smiled. I still couldn't believe that Tara was the school's inspiration, and no one would even think that it was her...it was pretty crazy. \"You guys at Lincoln Bay High killed it with the red yesterday, I noticed one of you wearing these red specs that were the epitome of cool. But can we talk about what's not cool for a second? I mean the school keeps confiscating our stuff, I mean I've lost two sets of headphones and an MP3 player just this term alone. Although I did notice some of us seem to be exact from this little stuff snatching epidemic. Funny how that works huh? Guys it's not just out playlists and players we're being deprived of yah know? Music is the soundtrack to our lives it's where we've been and where we're going and everywhere inbetween, our music is who we are. Are we gonna let someone just snatch that away from us? Or are we gonna change the game?\" Radio Rebel/Tara said. I smiled in amusement and wondered how my best friend was going to change our school system. And if she actually pulled it off that would be the most impressive, our school Principal wasn't exactly the fairest person in the world. If anything she shouldn't have been principal at all, but unfortunately for us we couldn't vote for principals. Although it would be a very good suggestion. \"Here's a new song about trying things you never thought you could. Look I've been tryna do a bunch of new things lately, and this song severely inspires me. So check it out. Vibe it, really really dig on it...and then, remember that feeling. Tomorrow at 8AM stop what you're doing get up and dance, just express yourself let yourself out. This is 'Turn it all around' by 'The G's'\" she said. As the music blasted my eyes widened and jaw dropped. This was going to blow their minds completely, it was blowing mine. I dug through my backpack and pulled out my cell phone dialling the first number I could think of...Gabe. \"Hello?\" he answered boredly. \"Hey Rockstar\" I greeted excitedly. \"Gabby? Did you change your number?\" he asked curiously. I rolled my eyes. \"Yes. Look do you listen to Radio Rebel?\" I asked sitting up straight. \"Not really. Why?\" he asked. I smirked. \"Listen to what is playing on my Radio\" I exclaimed before holding my phone out towards my laptop. After a few seconds I pulled it back to my ear \"Did you hear?\" I asked biting my bottom lip. He was obviously still there, I could hear his breathing. \"We're on the radio\" he said in disbelief. I giggled and nodded even though he couldn't see me. \"Yep, you made it Rockstar\" I replied leaning back against the headboard. \"I have to tell the guys. Thank you so much Gabb's, later babe\" he said excitedly. I nodded and hung up the phone. I dropped it onto my bed and suddenly realised something, he hadn't called me 'babe' since we were going out. I thought it over and another realisation hit me, I actually wanted back in with the band. Although I knew it would be too late for me now, they were famous-ish without me. So that was a no, but as for taking Gabe back...I was still very stuck. I was in music class the next day sat next to Lisa, we were discussing our song when the teacher silenced the class \"Quiet down everyone!\" she shouted, the class immediately settled \"It's nearly eight o'clock\" she pointed out while gesturing to the clock on the wall. Our teacher listened to Radio Rebel too apparently. We all cheered and she smiled. As soon as the clock hit eight music blasted through the school speakers. Everyone in our class jumped to their feet and started to dance, I stayed sat not quite in the mood for it \"C'mon Gabby\" Lisa begged sitting down on our desk. I shook my head. \"Nah, not in the mood for it\" I replied shrugging. She nodded and started to dance with the other classmates. \"So what's up with you?\" I looked up to see Gabe sat on my desk. I rolled my eyes and shrugged. \"Not in the mood to dance I guess, what about you?\" I asked tapping pencil against the wood. He also shrugged. \"You know I don't dance. But last night was pretty awesome, no one in the band even has an idea of how that DJ got our demo's\" he exclaimed in confusion. I nodded and leaned forward, resting my arms on the desk. \"Stop stressing over it, just enjoy the moment\" I said shrugging. He nodded in thought before turning to look at me. \"So...did you think over my offer?\" he asked slightly hopeful. I rolled my eyes again and sighed. \"Yes, I don't wanna be back in the band. I miss you guys but you're newborn pops now, I can't interfere with that\" I replied shaking my head. He nodded reluctantly. \"Alright. And the thing with...us?\" he asked hesitatingly. I opened my mouth about to reply when the Principals voice flooded through the speakers. \"This is a place of learning, not dancing. Anyone listening to Radio Rebel during school will be suspended and Radio Rebel I advise you to turn yourself in now, or your future will be Radio Silence\" She said. I rolled my eyes and leaned back in my seat. \"I'll see you at lunch, we will talk about this\" Gabe said hopping down from my desk. I nodded. \"Sounds good Rockstar\" I replied. He smirked and headed back to his desk.[Chapter 6] I walked out of the school with Tara and Audrey at lunch, holding the red tray with both hands. We were in the middle of discussing this mornings dance break when I noticed Gavin walking towards us. Apparently Tara had nearly danced with him this morning, but then Stacey jumped in stopping them from even going near each other. Life was probably pretty frustrating for Tara right now. \"Hey Tara\" Gavin called. We all paused and Tara's eyes widened \"Can I talk to you?\" he asked hopefully. She started to stutter and Audrey pushed her forward. \"You think she'll talk?\" I asked as we headed towards our own table. Audrey shrugged. Yeah, she's been getting better at it. Even talked to Stacey yesterday\" she replied sitting down. My eyes widened as I sat opposite her. \"I cannot believe that. You're kidding? She talked to Stacey?\" I asked in disbelief. She nodded in confirmation. \"Yeah, it wasn't an insult. But it was something yah know? She's actually breaking out of her shell\" she said shrugging and picking up her fork. I nodded in understanding and picked up my own fork, digging it into my chicken salad. I looked over to see Tara and Gavin actually talking, it was very surprising seen as she'd been spending the last 10 years of crushing avoiding him. \"Hey Gabb's\" I looked up to see Gabe stood next to our table, with his arms crossed. I nodded in greeting. \"Hi. Can I help you with something?\" I asked smirking slightly. I knew he wanted to talk but I wanted to tease him a little longer. \"Yeah can we...talk?\" he asked glancing at Audrey in a hinting manner. I nodded. \"About what?\" I asked innocently while tilting my head. He rolled his eyes and groaned. \"You know what Gabby! C'mon please\" he begged leaning down with his hands on the table. I giggled and Audrey was obviously stifling laughter. \"Sure. I'll be right back\" I told her. She nodded and I followed Gabe to another table. He sat down on one side while I sat opposite him, it was pretty awkward for a few seconds. \"So...\" he sighed resting his arms on the table in front of him. I nodded and did the same. \"Yup\" I muttered looking at everything, except him. \"Okay I'm gonna cut to the chase, we don't need to waste each others time\" he sighed shrugging. He always did get straight to it \"I wanna talk about your answer. And no pressure or anything, but do you have an answer?\" he asked hopefully. I sighed and thought about it for a moment. Did I miss him? Yes. Did I want him back? Maybe...I wasn't very good at answering things on the spot. \"I don't know, Gabe. I mean...\" I sighed frustratedly and rested my head on my palm. \"Woah there Gabb's, chill out. I said no pressure and I meant it, don't stress yourself out about this\" he reassured. I nodded and my right hand toyed with my necklace. But the harder I thought the more I wanted him back, despite the harsh break-up we went through before \"I'm not gonna lie to you, okay? I really miss you, I kind of make it obvious by wearing this necklace all the time\" I replied slightly muttering towards the end...I was really nervous. \"Are you saying what I hope you're saying?\" he asked tilting his head slightly. I sighed. \"I...I guess we could give it another shot\" I shrugged sitting straight and toying with my necklace again. He smiled. \"You're serious?\" he asked with wide eyes. I nodded and he jumped to his feet \"Oh my god I can't believe it\" I tilted my head curiously \"Uh Gabe, you alright?\" I asked. He nodded and stood in front of me. \"Yeah I feel amazing, I just didn't think you'd say yes. I was preparing for the worst, to be completely honest\" he admitted. He took both my hands in his and pulled me to my feet. \"So was I, but I had to admit we had fun together. But I swear Gabe if you turn into some egomaniac again like the last time then I'm gone\" I warned. He shook his head. \"No, I won't I swear\" he said drawing an X over his chest. I smiled as he pulled me into a tight hug. My arms wrapped around his neck, and my legs locked around his waist \"God I missed you\" he muttered. \"I missed you too\" I replied resting my head on his shoulder. The next day at lunch very loud music seemed to be coming from somewhere. I followed the crowd and found myself at the front of the school. A large fancy car was parked across the road with the words Slam FM written on the side, a large speaker on top of the car was the source of the music. I spotted Tara leaning against the pillar looking very smug, I crossed my arms curiously and approached her. \"What's going on?\" I asked shaking my head. She smiled. \"Well Moreno can't say anything about our dancing disrupting our studying now, because it's lunch time. Our time\" she replied. I chuckled and nodded. \"Good plan. Have you seen Audrey?\" I asked looking around for our over-dramatic best friend. \"Nope, not since this morning. She'll be here soon though\" she replied shrugging. I nodded and watched the dancing teens. \"Gabb's!\" We both turned our heads to see the G's a few feet away. I assumed Gabe was the one who called me \"C'mere\" he called waving me over. I shrugged and turned to Tara. \"Go\" she shrugged smiling. I tilted my head apologetically \"Don't worry about me, Audrey will be here soon. Go on Gabb's, you've spent 3 months without him. Now go\" she chuckled lightly shoving me. I rolled my eyes in amusement and walked towards the boys. \"Hi guys. How's it goin'?\" I greeted sitting on the table bench next to Gavin. \"It's alright. What's with the school lunch dance?\" he asked gesturing to the dancers. I shrugged. \"No idea\" I lied. He nodded and I turned to look up at Gabe \"Hey Rockstar\" I said playing with the chain hanging from his belt loops. \"Hey beautiful\" he greeted placing an arm around my shoulder. I smiled and leaned against him. \"Hey, hey, hey Lincoln Bay! This is Cammi Q comin' at you live. Ya'll feelin' good today?!\" The famous DJ asked exiting the car with a microphone. Everyone cheered in response \"Alright listen up, I gotta special message from my good friend. Radio Rebel\" she announced. She reached her arm through the car window and Radio Rebel's voice flooded through the speakers. \"This is Radio Rebel, comin' at yah with a little lunch time surprise. Now a lot of you guys have IM'd and texted me about the powers-to-be taking away our music, and it feels like part of ourselves are being taken away\" she said. The crowd boo'd \"That's not gonna make us better students, and you can't punish someone for relaxing during their down-time right Principal Moreno? You stole our music and I'm giving it back. Text in requests, lunch time is our time\" she said. The crowd cheered and I smiled. I walked out of my music lesson with Lisa, both of us discussing our song...it was going quite well. We were walking up the stairs when Principal Moreno appeared near the banister \"Can I have your attention please!\" she shouted. We all paused in our movements and turned to the Principal \"I want you all to know, that this lunch time fiasco was a...fiasco\" she shouted angrily. \"Clever words, did she come up with 'em all by herself?\" Lisa muttered. I giggled but quickly put a hand to my mouth hoping the principal didn't hear us. \"It is time for a certain DJ's reign of rebellion to come to an end. So anyone with any information regarding the identity of this Radio Rebel is to report it to me immediately, or risk facing disciplinary actions themselves\" Moreno said. I rolled my eyes \"Now get to class\" she said. Everyone got back to what they were doing and I carried on walking with Lisa \"That is so not fair, it's not like Radio Rebels braking any rules\" Lisa exclaimed shaking her head. I nodded in agreement. \"I know, it's pathetic. But what can we do about it? Moreno's the principal\" I pointed out shrugging. She sighed and we carried on heading to class.[Chapter 7] I sped-walked down the hall with Audrey towards Tara's class. She'd been nominated for prom queen...well, Radio Rebel was voted. But it was still Tara and Audrey and I were very eager to tell her, though Audrey seemed more excited than me. We spotted Tara walking out of class and quickly approached her. \"Tara! We have news\" Audrey exclaimed as we reached her. She looked around cautiously \"But we can't talk here\" she whispered. Tara gave her a look of confusion and Audrey dragged her towards the janitors closet \"Excuse me could you give us a minute?\" she asked as we found the janitor inside. \"But this is my office\" he said in disbelief. She nodded her head towards the door and he reluctantly left. I closed the door as she turned to Tara. \"So...guess who got nominated for Prom Queen\" Audrey said nonchalantly. Tara shrugged. \"Stacey?\" she asked sighing. \"You did\" Audrey squealed. I rolled my eyes. \"Well, not you. Radio Rebel but it's still you\" I added shrugging. \"This is horrible. The whole point of Radio Rebel is that she's anonymous remember? What's gonna happen if she wins? Who's gonna go up there and get the crown? I could get expelled. I have to put a stop to this\" she said horrified. \"Are you crazy? You can't quit now\" Audrey exclaimed shaking her head. The door opened revealing the janitor \"Not now Mr Mgowsky\" she said. \"But I need the broom\" he said. I grabbed the broom and handed it to him before shutting the door. \"You guys, I can't do this anymore\" Tara said apologetically. \"You can\" Audrey replied. \"I can't\" \"You can!\" The door opened again and I rolled my eyes. \"Not now\" We exclaimed in unison. \"I need the dustpan too\" he said. I handed him the dustpan and once again slammed the door shut. \"You're a hero to people and that's why they nominated you. You can't turn your back on them now, this is your time to shine\" Audrey exclaimed. \"What if I don't wanna shine? What if shining isn't really my thing?\" Tara asked nervously. \"Well as your BFFTLEWE we're legally obligated to make sure you do the show\" I replied shrugging innocently. \"Even if we have to drag you there\" Audrey added. Tara chuckled and we nodded before leaving the janitors closet. School was over and I was outside Slam FM, sat in Audrey's car. Tara had decided to bring us to Slam FM to see her during a show and we were pretty excited. Although I was a little confused as to why we had to park so far away from the building, and apparently so was Audrey. \"Remind me again why we had to park so far away\" she said as we unplugged the seatbelts. \"Because we can't risk anyone recognizing the car, or us. Wig me\" Tara explained. I handed them the wigs from the bag next to me before pulling on my own blonde wig. We zipped up the light brown trench coats before exiting the car. \"And this is where the magic happens\" Tara announced as we entered the recording room. I looked around in awe, I never expected it to be so big...and colourful. It was pretty awesome. \"Is this the famous Audrey Sharmah and Gabriella Ramirez?\" The famous DJ...Cammi Q, asked entering from a smaller recording room. We nodded and she hugged us both. The door suddenly opened and we all looked back to see Tara's step-dad. \"Could you girls excuse us for a moment?\" he asked gesturing to Tara. We all nodded and left the room. \"A lot of you, wanna know who I am. I get that, maybe it would be easier if you could see my face. But that's the thing, guys it's not about me it's about you. So you don't need to know my name. You wanna know who I am? I'm somebody who's tired of being afraid! I know how it can hold you back. So say it out loud, just say what you're afraid of. Call in, I dare you\" Tara said from the other room. Audrey, Cammi Q and I were in the room next door. There was a window so we could see what Tara was up to, we'd also been given a set of headphones so that we could listen in on the show. I still couldn't believe we were actually at Slam FM. \"I guess everyone's too afraid to say what they're afraid of. Maybe this song will inspire you...\" Tara paused as Cammi knocked on the window. \"Lines one through twenty\" she announced excitedly. \"You're on with Radio Rebel\" Tara said accepting one of the calls. I smiled and listened intently. The Calls: \"One time I accidentally swallowed a piece of tin foil so I'm afraid that if I stand too close to the microwave I'll explode\" \"I'm afraid of getting cut from the football team\" \"I'm afraid Larry might be losing it!\" \"I'm afraid of power outages\" \"I'm afraid to do my own thing\" End Calls: Audrey and I leaned forward, both sharing excited looks...it was Gavin. Tara sat straight in her seat at the sound of his voice slightly surprise \"I was too\" she admitted. \"Was?\" he asked curiously \"So what changed?\" \"I guess I started doing the show. And I realised you're not as alone as you feel. If you can remember that, it would be easier to take a risk. Do your own thing\" she replied shrugging. \"Yeah, thanks\" he said before hanging up. \"We're gonna take some more calls in a minute, in the mean time you guys are seriously gonna dig this next song\" Tara said. A rock song blasted through the headset and she raised to her feet. Audrey and I took off the headset before entering the main room \"Hey! Where are you going?\" Audrey asked curiously. Tara shrugged. \"Just somewhere, to do...something\" she replied before leaving the room. I nodded and fell down onto the red leather couch. \"I'm afraid of hyenas\" Audrey exclaimed, squealing in delight afterwards. I chuckled and shook my head \"What are you afraid of Gabb's?\" she asked curiously while falling onto the couch next to me. I shrugged. \"I don't know. I don't think I'm afraid of anything\" I lied resting my head on my palm. She tilted her head with a disbelieving expression. \"C'mon, you can tell me\" she reassured \"I won't tell anyone\" she added. I sighed and nodded. \"I'm scared of...losing my friends\" I admitted. She nodded and tilted her head once again. \"If you don't mind me asking. Why?\" she asked curiously. \"Because before I met you and Tara I was a Queen B. And when I started dating Gabe, he wasn't popular. So Stacey warned me that if I carried on dating a loser then I would be dumped. I carried on and soon enough I fell down the ladder, until I was all alone. But things got better when I met you and Tara, you guys are real friends\" I explained shrugging. She smiled and nodded. \"But how were you alone? I thought you had Gabe?\" she said confused. I sighed at the memory. \"Yeah, when I became unpopular because of him. He felt as though he had to make it up to me. So we started the band but things became worse. He turned into an egomaniac and he flirted with every girl, he was such a jerk. So when I finally had enough I left the band...and him. I was totally alone after that\" I said shaking my head. She nodded with a sympathetic expression. \"Wow, well you don't have to feel alone ever again. You're our best friend, we won't let that happen\" she reassured. I smiled and nodded. \"I know\" I replied resting my head on the back of the couch.[Chapter 8] I was in music class sat next to Lisa, both of us discussing our song. Everything had been going amazing...surprisingly. Gabe hadn't turned into a jerk, yet anyway. And Tara's radio show was doing amazing, so everything was going good. At least it was until today. \"Attention students, there's been some controversy about the identity of Radio Rebel. And there is nothing more distracting than controversy. Now, I gave her the chance to do the right thing and turn herself in. But she chose to hide, avoiding the consequences of her insubordination. Well she can't hide forever which is why until Radio Rebel's identity is revealed. I'm cancelling the prom\" Moreno announced through the speakers. \"Bitch!\" Lisa shouted jumping to her feet. My eyes widened as every head turned to her \"Sorry\" she muttered quiet before sitting back down. I chuckled and shook my head. \"That's so not fair\" I exclaimed shaking my head. \"For everyone\" Moreno added chuckling. I narrowed my eyes and shook my head in disbelief \"Now do you think there's favouritism at Lincoln Bay?\" she asked. I groaned and let my head fall onto the desk. I hid behind the protest signs with Tara and Audrey glancing at the teens surrounding us. Stacey had decided to form a protest outside Slam FM, demanding Radio Rebel to come forward so that we could have our Prom. Unfortunately for Tara though, it meant she couldn't get into the building without being spotted by Stacey or the other students. So in the mean time we'd joined the protest trying desperately to think of a way to get in. \"How are we gonna get in there?\" Tara asked staring at the building. I shrugged in response and Cammi Q appeared in the window. She waved and Tara mouthed 'help'. She suddenly had a look of thought and held up her index finger, we nodded and a camera crew ran towards us. \"Who do you blame for your prom being cancelled?\" The new reported woman asked aiming the microphone at Tara. \"Look everybody it's Radio Rebel!\" Audrey shouted pointing towards the building. I looked to see Cammi jogging away from the crowd, her hood had been pulled up so no one could see who it really was. The protestor's and camera crew's chased after her, allowing us to sneak into Slam FM unseen. \"Hi out there in radio land, a lot's happened since we last hang out huh? Let me know what you guys think, call me, text me, scroll on my wall. Don't be shy\" Tara said through the headset. Audrey and I were on the red leather couch listening intently. The Calls: \"Do you know how many dreams you've crushed by ruining prom?\" \"I agree with the last caller, I'd just got a date and now it's cancelled?\" \"This is the last time I'm listening to you. Ever\" \"Who do you think you are?\" \"You disappointed everyone!\" \"You don't care about anyone but yourself!\" \"I thought you were on my side\" End Calls: My eyes widened and so did Audrey's \"Wow. But you guys are being honest about how you feel. You're on line two\" Tara sighed. \"I've always liked you Radio Rebel. Your playlists truly rock but...\" Gavin paused and Tara shook her head. \"Go ahead, let it out\" she said clenching her eyes shut for a moment. \"It's just, there's a girl I was hoping to impress that night\" he said. \"Stacey\" Audrey whispered rolling her eyes. \"Sorry about that\" Tara replied shrugging. \"Yeah, me too\" he said before hanging up. I sighed and rested my head on the back of the couch. \"Wow, guess you guys are pretty upset. Well, I'll just play some music\" Tara said. The song started to play \"This ones for you guys, thanks for being honest with me and I'm sorry I let yah down\" she said apologetically. Cammi walked out of the small room and her step-dad entered. \"They're just angry, they'll come around\" he reassured \"It doesn't take away from all the good things you've done as Radio Rebel\" \"Did you hear them? They hate me. I ruined their prom, I feel horrible\" she sighed. \"You didn't ruin it. That principal did\" Cammi pointed out. \"I mean I knew she was angry, but I didn't think she'd do something like this\" Tara said rising to her feet. \"Man that Moreno's such a backwards thinker\" Cammi said shaking her head. Tara nodded and suddenly had a look of thought. \"Backwards. That's brilliant\" she whispered. \"What?\" I asked confusedly. She turned to me and Audrey. \"Backwards. Backwards\" she repeated smiling. Audrey gave her a confused look and I titled my head. We stared through the exit door of Slam FM at the still protesting teens. There had to be someway out, we just didn't exactly know it yet \"I thought they'd be gone by now\" Tara said shaking her head. She peeked through the door again before turning to us, a smirk on her face \"This calls for a professional\" she said. We gave her confused looks again and she dragged us behind the reception desk. \"Did someone order the lavidi subtaculor? Hello?\" We raised our heads to see the dancing sandwich from the street. He jumped in surprise. \"Hi, could you do us a favour?\" Tara asked hopefully. \"You want, extra marinara?\" he asked hesitatingly. \"Oh that would be awesome...\" Audrey started. \"Audrey\" I said warningly. \"And focussing\" she sighed looking down \"I am the hyena\" she added looking back up. \"You see those girls out there?\" Tara asked pointing to the crowd \"We need to get outta there without any of them seeing us\" \"You can count on me\" The sandwich reassured. He left the building and we slowly walked towards the door. He started dancing and it didn't take long for him to distract the protestors. With the sandwich guy distracting the crowd, we successfully managed to sneak our way out of the building and towards Audrey's car.[Chapter 9] I was, once again. Sat in music class waiting for the announcement to be made. Tara's plan was absolutely brilliant, but I still wondered how they were going to get it through the school speakers. \"Good morning Lincoln Bay High School, this is Cammi Q from Slam FM bringing you a special message from...\" Cammi's voice said through the speaker. \"Radio Rebel here, now you guys really unleashed your fury about the prom drama and I want you to know that you've been totally heard. Cancelling prom was monumentally unfair but blaming Moreno isn't going to solve anything. I wanna do something about it, and so does Slam. Which is why we're giving you what you want...your prom back\" Tara's voice said...well, Radio Rebel's. The whole music class cheered and I smiled. \"This is amazing!\" Lisa exclaimed excitedly. I nodded in agreement. \"Slam FM is throwing it's first ever Morp. That's prom spelled backwards because we're turning prom upside down. Tickets are free and everyone is invited so don't worry about finding a date or spending your college savings on a dress, tux or a limo. Just come as you are, because that's the way we like you\" Radio Rebel said. Lisa smiled and pulled herself up onto our desk, facing me. \"This is...unbelievable! I was so upset about prom being cancelled, I guess now everything's cool again\" she shrugged. I nodded. \"Yeah. Just out of curiosity, were you going with anyone?\" I asked resting my folded arms on the desk. She nodded her cheeks turning pink. \"Yeah, his names Tommy\" she replied shyly. She was never shy, so this was quite amusing for me. \"Do I know him?\" I asked. I'd ran the name through my brain but couldn't think of anyone I knew with the name 'Tommy'. \"Yeah. He's the kid who...\" she paused and toyed with the sleeves of her shirt nervously. I tilted my head. \"C'mon tell be\" I begged. She sighed and leaned forward as though getting ready to tell a huge secret. \"He's the guy who drives the remote control car around school\" she admitted shrugging. Now him I knew. \"Wow! Really? That's great\" I reassured. She smiled with a surprised expression. \"You mean you're not gonna tease me because I'm going with him?\" she asked with raised eyebrows. I shook my head and shrugged. \"No, if you said yes then he must be a nice guy\" I replied. She sighed in relief. \"Thanks. Speaking of Morp who are you going with?\" she asked smirking and leaning back on her palms. I sighed and fiddled with my G necklace. \"No one\" I replied shrugging. Her jaw dropped and eyebrows shot up. \"You're serious? I thought you and Gabe were back on\" she said her tone full of confusion. I nodded. \"We are, he just hasn't asked me. I'm not that bothered though, I'm sure I won't be the only one going solo\" I shrugged resting my hands on the desk. \"I know but...\" she sighed and shook her head \"He's your boyfriend! He should ask you\" she exclaimed. My eyes widened and I did a quick scan of the class, sighing in relief once I found that no one had heard her...Gabe included. \"Look it's not big deal Lis'. I'm fine with it, really\" I reassured. She nodded but still kept that disappointed expression. I put my books into my locker before pulling out my English book. What I talked to Lisa about in English class did worry me a little, but who could blame me? The last time we went out he'd spent half our time flirting and hanging out with other girls. So for all I knew he'd asked some other girl to Prom instead of me, but on the other hand I could just be getting paranoid over nothing...I hoped it was the last one. A pair of arms wrapped around my waist and a body pressed against my back, I smiled knowing exactly who it was \"Hey beautiful\" He greeted resting his head on my shoulder. I giggled and closed my locker. \"Hey rockstar. How's famous life?\" I asked closing my locker and turning in his arms. He shrugged as I placed my hands on his shoulders. \"It's pretty good. I wish you knew how good it was\" he said looking down at me. Even when I was in heels...which was all the time, he was a few inches taller than me. But tallness ran in his family. \"Yeah, well\" I shrugged and sighed in thought while staring at his chest. Whenever I was feeling upset about something I wasn't able to look people in the eyes, it was a nervous habit I guess. \"You alright?\" he asked. I nodded reassuringly and managed to look up at him. \"Yeah, sure I'm fine. So you heading to English?\" I asked desperately trying to change the subject. He nodded. \"Yup, but I wanted to ask you something first\" he said smirking slightly. I narrowed my eyes in confusion. \"What?\" I asked hesitatingly. He shrugged innocently. \"Well, since prom has been cancelled I guess going to Morp wouldn't be so bad. But what I'm saying is, will you go to Morp with me?\" he asked hopefully. I smiled and bit my bottom lip trying to hide my excitement...I guess this meant I was just paranoid before. \"I'd love to\" I replied. He smiled and leaned down pressing his lips against my own. I smiled into the kiss and moved my mouth with his, his kisses always made me very light headed. And after finding out that fact he loved to use it whenever he could...though I wasn't really complaining. After a few seconds he slowly pulled away. I re-opened my eyes and found we were both panting slightly \"So I'll text you what time I'll be at your house, and we'll go to Morp\" he said resting his forehead against mine. I nodded mutely still dazed from the kiss. \"Uh-huh\" I whispered. He chuckled and pecked my lips one more time. \"C'mon gorgeous, we got a class to get to\" he said placing an arm around my shoulder. I nodded and put my own around his waist before heading to English class.[Chapter 10] I walked out of my Biology lesson clutching my books to my chest when Tara ran towards me at full speed, looking pretty worried \"What?\" I asked narrowing my eyes. She panted heavily. \"It ain't good Gabby, not good\" she said shaking her head. \"What happened?\" I asked curiously. Tara glanced around nervously. \"Not here, c'mon\" she whispered grabbing my wrist. In less than 10 seconds I found myself in the janitors closet with Tara...something must've been wrong for her to be this frantic. \"What?\" I repeated confusedly. She sighed. \"Stacey knows\" she said nervously. My eyes widened. \"How? How does Stacey know?\" I asked in disbelief. She sighed again. \"I mentioned something yesterday about her being my number one fan as a joke, and then I said it on the show...it's all my fault\" she exclaimed shaking her head. I shrugged. \"If she doesn't have proof then what's the big deal? Wait, she doesn't have proof does she?\" I asked worriedly. They shook their heads and I sighed in relief \"Then what's the problem?\" I asked shrugging. \"She's throwing a party for our whole year tonight, and it's the same time as my show. If I don't go she'll know I'm Radio Rebel and she'll tell Moreno, but I can't not do the show! What am I going to do?\" she whined. I sighed and nodded in understanding. \"Okay here's what we do. You give Cammi Q a call and explain it to her...and your mom\" I instructed. She narrowed her eyes in confusion. \"My mom? How does this help?\" she asked. I smirked slightly. \"I may have a plan\" I said crossing my arms. She tilted her head with a slightly nervous look. \"Should I be worried?\" she asked. My smirk widened. I walked into Stacey's house with Tara feeling very smug. The plan we'd managed to devise with her mom an' Cammi was definitely going to work...there was no reason it wouldn't. We both looked up to see Stacey and her friend on the balcony \"Hi\" Tara said loudly gaining their attention. They both looked down at us with annoyed expressions. \"Here we are\" I said shrugging and crossing my arms. Tara nodded and clasped her hands behind her back innocently. \"So I see, but I'm still watching you\" Stacey said warningly. I rolled my eyes and nodded before closing the front door and heading into the living room. Most of the people from our year were here. Including Audrey, Barry and Larry. We sat down on the couch inbetween the three as Radio Rebel was announced on the radio. \"This is Radio Rebel, comin' atcha live from Slam FM. Tonight is all about you, lines are open you know the number\" Radio Rebels voice said. I looked up to see Stacey still on the balcony. \"I'm calling into the show!\" She announced pulling out her cell-phone. \"How are you here and there?\" Audrey asked curiously. Tara shrugged in response. \"You're on with Radio Rebel\" Radio Rebel said through the radio, accepting Stacey's call. \"Do you know that you're a hypocrite?\" Stacey asked from the balcony. \"Hi, what's your name caller?\" \"Save it! You say you're all about the people, but Morp is all about you. Now you get to lobby for Morp queen votes on the radio every night. Not fair! The other Morp queen nominee should get some air time. Meaning me!\" Stacey exclaimed. \"I totally hear you\" \"You hear me? I don't think you do\" \"Say what you wanna say\" I could tell Stacey was getting more and more irritated each time Radio Rebel replied to her insults. \"I think you're using subliminal brain washing to get people to vote for you. So I'm gonna take this opportunity to ask the school to vote for me. Stacey for Morp queen\" \"Hi, what's your name caller?\" \"You already asked me that!\" I flinched at the mess up and sighed nervously. \"Thanks for calling\" \"I'm not done with you! Sorry but we can't all be winners. And I'm gonna win, despite the fact that I don't have an entire radio show campaigning for me. Which really makes me the underdog\" During Stacey's rant Tara had left the seat and ran off somewhere...I just really hoped she knew what she was doing. Stacey looked down at me looking for Tara, but smirked slightly once she noticed Tara was gone \"Why so quiet? Does the truth hurt?\" \"You wanna know the truth...?\" \"Stop hogging the bathroom!\" I chuckled despite my nervous feeling and leaned back into the couch. \"What was that?\" Stacey asked. She disappeared from the balcony, probably to go look for Tara. \"I uh...knocked over my chair. Because I wanted to get closer to the mic so that you could hear me clearly\" \"Oh I can hear you clearly. I can hear you very clearly. I can hear you so clearly Radio Rebel that we could be in the same building!\" \"Same building? What are you crazy? Are you here at Slam Stacey? I don't see you or maybe you're hiding somewhere. I'm just a bit worried about you Stacey, I'm afraid that if I beat you out for Morp queen your fragile ego won't be able to survive\" The whole room laughed, me and Audrey included. \"Can you hand me my jacket?\" \"What was that?\" \"I'm sorry what?\" \"Who was that?\" \"That was my sound guy, we just got a brand new demo which they called 'my jacket'. We could play it for you\" \"I have a better idea! Why don't you come forward and stop hiding like a coward?\" \"Would a coward be afraid to go against you for Morp queen? Cuz I'm not. I'll see you there and you'll see that I'm not afraid of anything. Thanks for calling\" Radio Rebel said cheerfully. Music flooded through the speakers and I sighed in relief. \"That was the most amazing thing ever\" Audrey exclaimed giggling. I smiled and nodded in agreement.[Chapter 11] I stood in the backyard with Audrey and the rest of the party people, watching the band get the stage ready to play. Tara soon appeared next to us and I smiled \"That was amazing. She was freaked out\" Audrey giggled handing Tara a drink. She nodded and I noticed Gavin smile at her from the stage...apparently so did Audrey \"And Gavin just smiled at you\" she sang. \"I think it was more of a general smile\" Tara said shrugging. \"Looked pretty specific to me\" I said before taking a sip of my soda. \"Hey\" Larry and Barry greeted standing next to us. \"I cannot wait for this\" Larry exclaimed gesturing to the band. \"We're the G's and this is 'We so Fly'\" Gabe said through the mic. The music started up and everyone cheered. \"Here we go Caught me sneaking out the back. Daddy chased me down the street. Good thing I've been running track. He'll ground me till I'm 83! Gonna meet up with my homies, Party like we're VIP. You'd be glad to say you know me Satisfaction guaranteed So rock with us tonight! We so fly We so fly We so fly We hate your b.s. We so fly We so fly\" Tara and Audrey squealed in surprise and I turned to see what'd happened. Audrey's cup was now empty and an angry looking Stacey's shirt was soaked \"Are you kidding me?!\" She shouted. \"I didn't do anything, you bumped into me\" Audrey replied nervously. \"You come to my house then you spill your drink on me. This cost a fortune!\" Stacey screeched. \"It was an accident Stacey, Audrey would never do something like that on purpose. Unlike some people\" Tara said shooting her a knowing look. My eyes widened slightly and so did Audrey's...Tara had never stuck up for someone before. \"Do you know what your problem is?! Your...\" \"You know what?\" Tara asked cutting off Stacey \"I don't care what you think my problem is. Keep it to yourself\" she said. Stacey stuttered in surprise and I snickered. \"I need a new outfit!\" she exclaimed before storming away. \"Thanks for that\" Audrey sighed pulling Tara into a hug \"Looks like Radio Rebels rubbing off on you too\" she said as they both pulled back. Tara chuckled and I smiled before turning back to the band. The sky was now dark and the band were packing up. Most of the party people had already left and very few were still here. I hadn't seen Stacey since Tara's comeback but I assumed she was in the house throwing a tantrum. Audrey, Barry and Larry had also left because of their curfew. However Tara and I had stayed, I was waiting for Gabe and she wanted to speak to Gavin...but she was having a little trouble. \"I just need to go over there and speak to him\" she whispered facing me. I nodded and noticed him approach her from behind. \"Good luck Tara, tell me how it goes?\" I asked hopefully. She nodded and turned around nearly crashing into Gavin. I smiled in amusement and walked away from the two, hoping something good came from this conversation. \"Gabb's!\" I looked up to see Gabe leaning against the pillar. I nodded in greeting and walked towards him. \"Hey rockstar, good song\" I said crossing my arms. He smiled. \"It's good right? Anyway I won't be long, just have to load up the van\" he reassured. I nodded and shrugged. \"It's fine, besides Tara's still here. So I'll talk to her while I wait for you\" I replied. He nodded slowly. \"Right...uh, where's Tara?\" he asked curiously. I pointed a thumb over my shoulder. \"Talking to Gavin. Why?\" I asked tilting my head slightly. He seemed to roll his eyes as I told him where Tara was, but he obviously didn't think I noticed. \"Nothing just asking. Anyway, you do still want a lift home right?\" he asked taking my hands in his. I nodded. \"Yup, you still offering?\" I asked hopefully. He chuckled. \"Of course, you're my girlfriend. I'd drive you anywhere, anytime\" he said leaning down towards me. I giggled as his lips connected with mine. I'd had music this morning, but my amazing teacher had allowed me to go and watch Tara's Drama/English class. She was performing today and I was kind of excited, it would be her first time talking in front of a whole class. My class weren't doing much really, we didn't have to perform the songs until next week and she had nothing else for us to do. So while she graded some other classwork she allowed us to have a free reign, as long as we didn't bother principal Moreno that is. I walked around to the backstage entrance to wish Tara good luck, when I found it was already occupied. Gabe and the other two G's were stood in the doorway, while Gavin stood opposite them \"Dude, ready to rock out with the drama dorks?\" Gabe asked. He and the other two snickering. \"That's funny...have you guys seen Tara? She's late\" Gavin said nervously. I narrowed my eyes in confusion, Tara may have been shy...but she was never late for lessons. \"Move on already! Pay attention to Stacey\" Gabe exclaimed. I narrowed my eyes again, but in annoyance. \"You're turning into a real jerk. You know that don't you?\" Gavin asked. \"Me?\" Gabe asked chuckling in disbelief. Gavin nodded \"You're the one who needs to get his priorities straight\" he said. \"Or what? You're gonna kick me outta the band?\" Gavin asked shaking his head. \"Is that what you want?\" Gabe asked. \"What I want is for you to drop this stupid 'rockstar' act for five minutes and just try, try to be a normal person\" Gavin replied. \"Okay, I am the front man of this band. This 'rockstar' act is what put us on the map. And if you don't wanna be part of that then that's fine with us\" Gabe shrugged. My eyes widened. \"What happened to G's for life?\" Gavin asked tilting his head. \"Hmm, yeah ask yourself that. Enjoy your solo career Gavin\" Gabe said dissapointedly. Gavin shook his head in disbelief. \"If this is how you acted 3 months ago, then I don't blame Gabb's for leaving\" he exclaimed. That must've hit a sore spot for Gabe, at least I assumed it did. \"That wasn't my fault, okay?! She left because she couldn't handle the pressure of being a singer, it had absolutely nothing to do with me!\" he shouted. I shook my head and sighed quietly before walking away...and here I thought he'd changed. I walked out of the school at the end of the day feeling lower than ever. Me leaving the band had nearly everything to do with him! He knew it was partly his fault, but I guess he was still that same jerk from 3 months ago. Blames everyone but himself. \"Hey Gabb's\" I looked up to see the devil himself leaning against the hood of his car, arms crossed and a smirk on his face. I sighed and nodded in greeting. \"Hi\" I said crossing my arms. He tilted his head and the smirk fell. \"You alright?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"Not really. I have to talk to you\" I replied biting my bottom lip nervously. He nodded as a sign to go on \"We're done\" I said. His eyes narrowed. \"Wait what do you mean by 'done'? Are you breaking up with me? Again?\" he asked slightly angered. I nodded in confirmation. \"Yeah, I guess I couldn't handle the pressure\" I said glaring. Realisation crossed his face and he sighed. \"Gabby...\" he started. I held up a hand cutting him off. \"No. You know as well as I do that us breaking up had a lot to do with you! But no you blamed it on pressure. God I was such a dumbass to think you'd actually changed!\" I exclaimed shaking my head. I sighed and thought for a moment before finally deciding. I reached both hands behind my neck and unclasped my necklace. \"Gabb's, what are you doing?\" he asked nervously. I took his hands and opened his palm before slowly lowering the necklace into his hand. \"Enjoy your solo life Gabe\" I said angrily before heading home.[Chapter 12] Author's Note: So, if you want to know what Gabby's dress looks like in this chapter the link is on my profile. That's about it but I hope you enjoy the rest of the story. I walked into one of the large rooms in Slam FM and my eyes widened. The whole room was very colourful, a lot more colourful than any normal prom. Nearly all the people from school were here and most of them were dancing. Others were hanging around the food tables or sat down in groups. But it looked absolutely amazing in there. I spotted Audrey, Larry and Barry near the wall and I sighed slightly relieved. I walked towards the trio and their eyes widened slightly \"Wow! You look amazing!\" The twins exclaimed in unison. I smiled and nodded. \"Thanks, you guys look amazing too\" I replied crossing my arms. \"Thanks. But do you know where Tara is?\" Audrey asked hopefully. I shook my head. \"More to the point where is Radio Rebel?!\" Larry asked. \"Oh, my true love will be revealed. How do I look?\" Barry asked nervously. I rolled my eyes in amusement as Audrey turned her head, searching for Tara. \"A little green. Could be the lighting or something worse\" Larry replied pulling out some hand sanitizer and squirting it into Barry's hands. He did the same to Audrey and then me. I rolled my eyes and rubbed in the gooey liquid. I looked up and my eyes widened slightly. Tara walked toward us smiling shyly, she looked amazing! \"Hey\" she greeted. \"You look amazing!\" Audrey exclaimed. I nodded in agreement. \"Thanks, I need to talk to you\" Tara said taking both our hands and leading us a few feet away from the boys \"Have you seen Gavin? I really need to talk to him\" she said nervously. \"What are you gonna say?\" Audrey asked. \"I don't know\" \"You mean you haven't...\" \"Not yet\" \"You know you need to...\" \"I know!\" \"Are we missing something?\" Barry asked as he and his brother appeared behind us. I shook my head. \"No it's okay. Conference, now!\" I said. Both girls nodded and we headed behind the stage. \"I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out\" Tara said nervously. \"Just breathe\" Audrey instructed. Tara nodded and took a slow, deep breath. \"Okay, okay\" she sighed nodding. Audrey and I nodded rising to our feet. We were about to head back into the room when something caught our eyes. It was Stacey...alone and staring into a small compact mirror. \"You're beautiful. And you're queen no matter what happens\" she sighed before closing the mirror. She took a few deep breaths before re-entering the main room. Audrey, Tara and I shared slightly sad looks before entering the Morp. \"Good evening Seattle! You ready to find out who your Morp queen is?\" Cammi asked walking onto the stage. The crowd cheered excitedly \"We had two nominations for Morp king but, one dropped out. So that leaves Gabe La-Violet\" she announced. I sighed and tilted my head as he walked up onto the stage smiling. But despite my sad feeling I clapped along with the crowd as he was crowned. \"Now I'd like to invite your Morp court princesses to join me on stage. Let's hear it for Stacey Debane\" Cammi said. We all clapped as Stacey walked on stage, despite how much of a bitch she was to most of the school \"And Radio Rebel!\" The crowd cheered louder but Tara remained in her spot next to me \"Radio Rebel. Are you out there?\" Cammi asked hopefully. She quickly glanced at Tara who shook her head in response. \"Well I guess we'll continue. Your Morp queen is...Radio Rebel\" Cammi announced. The crowd cheered again and Tara disappeared somewhere. I looked around quickly before sighing and turning back to the stage. The cheering quieted as people realised, Radio Rebel wasn't making an appearance. \"Most of you don't know me\" All heads turned to the white screen, where a figure could be seen behind. I smiled slightly and crossed my arms \"I'm the girl who sits at the back of the class, who never raises her hand, who's so afraid of saying the wrong thing so says nothing instead. The old me would've frozen in front of a crowd like this. But something happened, suddenly the real stuff we were dealing with at school became more important than my fears. Look I wasn't sure I would be able to do this tonight, but I've got to be true to myself. So here goes\" Tara stepped down from behind the screen and walked into the middle of the stage, facing the crowd. \"I'm Radio Rebel\" she finally announced. The crowd seemed to freeze for a moment, before they burst out into loud cheers...Audrey and I included. She smiled in relief and I bit my bottom lip. But just as things were going well, they soon headed downhill. Moreno walked onto the stage, clapping slowly. I rolled my eyes and sighed as the cheers died down. \"Thank you for an enlightening evening. And now that I know who Radio Rebel is...\" she said pointing to Tara and chuckling \"She is definitely getting expelled\" she said. The crowd gasped and my eyes narrowed in disbelief \"Enjoy your Morp Tara, and don't bother coming to school on Monday\" she laughed. I shook my head and headed towards one of the tables. This was my turn to return the favour, the favour Tara did by helping me back to my feet when I was all alone...she was not getting expelled, not if I could help it. I hopped up onto the table before swinging my legs over and rising to my feet. I sighed before taking a deep breath \"I'm Radio Rebel!\" I shouted. All heads turned to me and I winked at Audrey, she smiled catching onto my idea. \"I'm Radio Rebel!\" she shouted. \"No I'm Radio Rebel\" Gavin said afterwards. \"No I'm Radio Rebel!\" Stacey's friend exclaimed excitedly. Just as I'd hoped, my plan started off a domino effect. In less than a few seconds, everyone in the room were chanting 'I'm Radio Rebel'. \"You can't expel everyone. Can you?\" Cammi asked smugly. Moreno shook her head in defeat, and handed the mic back to Tara before walking away. We all cheered once she was gone and I laughed in relief. I sighed and smiled as the two other G band members helped me down from the table. \"I believe this belongs to you\" Cammi said handing the queen crown to Tara. \"I mean, I guess since we're all Radio Rebel. This crown belongs to all of us, so congratulations kings and queens\" Tara said chuckling. The crowd cheered again \"But there is one person who's been dreaming of this crown her entire life. Although I'm not quite sure if I heard her say she was Radio Rebel\" she said walking towards Stacey. She aimed the mic at her and Stacey smiled. \"I'm Radio Rebel. I'm so Radio Rebel\" she exclaimed excitedly. \"Well then\" Tara placed the crown on Stacey's head and the crowd cheered again...me included. It had been a while since the crowning and Tara's Radio Rebel revelation. A few crowns had been thrown into the crowd, so now nearly everyone were wearing one. I was sat on one of the tables talking to Lisa and her date. He was actually a really nice guy, and he seemed to make Lisa really happy. But while I was happy for her, I was sad too. For one thing I missed my necklace, but not just that...I missed the person who gave it to me. But was I ready to put myself through it all again? Not really. \"Everyone, please give it up for Lincoln Bay's very own Gavin Morgan\" Cammi said through the stage Mic. We all cheered as Gavin walked onto the stage, holding a guitar. She walked off the stage leaving him as the only one up there. \"There's a girl I've liked for a while now, she's the kinda girl who's not afraid to ask a dancing sandwich for help\" he said. My eyes widened and I tilted my head \"This song's for her\" he said. He started to play the guitar and I shook my head in disbelief. \"He was the sandwich\" I whispered to myself in thought. Lisa gave me a curious look and I shrugged in response \"Long story\" I replied. She nodded and we both turned back to the stage. \"Walls you can build all around Just to shield a piece of your world out of sight And I needed you to look through To the shadows I tried to burry inside Drawing them out to the light You showed me I got nothing here to hide...\" My eyes widened slightly as Gabe and the other two G's, climbed up on stage heading towards their instruments and started playing. I smiled slightly and tilted my head, listening to the beautiful sound of the song. \"Now I can be who I am Now I can stand up for everyone to see Takin' this life in my hands Now I can be, Now I can be the real me\" The song faded, a sign that he had finished and the whole crowd cheered loudly. The group jumped down from the stage and a slow song started to play. Couples got together and swayed on the dance floor. Lisa's date re-appeared and he held out his hand to her \"You wanna dance?\" he asked hopefully. She glanced at me questioningly and I smiled. \"Go, Lis'. I'll be fine I swear\" I reassured. She smiled gratefully before taking his hand, allowing him to lead her into the crowd of swaying loved-up teens. I sighed and rested my chin on my closed fists. I noticed Tara talking to Gavin and I smiled slightly. I wanted to be happy for my friends, I really did...well I was a little. But I really envied them, they had guys singing for them and treating them right. Yet here I was feeling horrible about dumping a jerk. \"Hey Gabb's\" I flinched in surprise and slowly looked up. I sighed and nodded in greeting. \"Hi\" I greeted quietly. \"Look, I'm so sorry about before. I didn't mean what I said, I just get really touchy when people ask me about what happened to us back then. I know I was a jerk but I don't need people calling me out on it\" Gabe said shaking his head. I nodded in understanding. \"I forgive you, I guess. But I don't wanna get back together, I'm not ready to put myself through it all again\" I replied sighing. He nodded and shrugged. \"I understand. As long as we're talking and you forgive me. But even though we're not going out now. You wanna dance?\" he asked slightly hopeful. I shrugged and nodded. \"Why not?\" I hopped down from the table and he held his hand out to me. I narrowed my eyes. \"Just as friends\" he exclaimed reassuringly. I giggled and nodded placing his hand and mine. He smiled and pulled me into the middle of the crowd before placing his hands on my waist. I put mine on his shoulders and sighed quietly...not matter how much I missed it, I was not giving in this time. But not everything stays the same, and girls always tend to change their minds. Author's Note: Hope you enjoyed the chapter. But this is not the last chapter in case you were wondering. There is one more to come, I will update soon. Anyway thank you for reading and review if you can please[Chapter 13] Author's Note: Ok, so. With the singing part, normal is Gabby and italic is Lisa. And both of them together is bold. I will list the name and author of the songs in the author's note at the end of this chapter. Anyway hope you enjoy the chapter. I walked into the school with Tara and Audrey smiling and talking, as usual. It had been 2 days since prom and Tara was now unbelievably popular. She only hung out with Audrey and I explaining that she didn't want too much to change. Her step-dad had allowed the show to carry on even though everyone now knew who Radio Rebel was. And Moreno couldn't kick Tara out because if she tried, the whole school would turn themselves in as Radio Rebel. So in short, life was pretty good right now. I entered the auditorium with the rest of my music class feeling more nervous than ever. It was the day of our performances that determined our grades, and even though Lisa and I had rehearsed about a thousand times I was terrified. Which was strange because I was never usually nervous about much, but a lot had changed in the past few weeks. \"Alright class, settle down\" Mrs Davies said loudly from the stage. We all immediately quieted and turned to face her \"Now I'm sure some of you are nervous, but there is nothing to be worried about. If you aren't feeling up to it then let me know now, but there is no pressure\" she said crossing her arms, waiting for a reply. When none came she smiled \"Good. Now who wants to go first?\" she asked excitedly. A few hands shot up into the air and she chuckled \"Alright. Jess, you're up\" she said pointing to one of my classmates. The girl walked up onto the stage and I sighed nervously, before trying to take my mind off it by listening to the music. The class clapped as another one of our classmates descended the stage stairs. We'd gone through a lot of people, I'd never realised my class had so many people before this moment \"Very good Charlotte. Okay, who's next?\" Mrs Davies asked standing from her chair. I tilted my head and waited for the next person to raise their hand, when something horrific happened...it was Lisa's hand that rose. \"Me and Gabriella will go next\" she exclaimed shrugging. Mrs Davies smiled and my eyes widened. \"What? No\" I whispered pleadingly. Lisa rose to her feet and rolled her eyes at me. \"C'mon the sooner we get it over with the better. I know you're nervous but it won't be that bad. I promise\" she replied looking down at me. I sighed in thought for a moment before shaking my head and also rising to my feet. \"You're lucky I like you\" I muttered following her onto the stage. She giggled as she sat down at the school piano, with a mic on top. I sat down on one of the wooden stool chairs with a mic in front. I took a deep breath at the sight of all the people watching me, and they seemed to double the more nervous I got. Lisa cleared her throat next to me and I glanced back at her, she nodded towards the mic and I sighed before also nodding...the sooner I did this, the better. \"You seem too good, Too good to be true. You're holding me stronger, Stronger than I'm used to. Don't go out with the boys tonight I won't sleep a wink, Wondering what you're doing. Don't go out with the girls tonight I will turn to drink, Wondering what you're proving. You seem to good, To good to be true. I'm loving you longer, Longer than I'm used to. Don't go out with the boys tonight I won't sleep a wink, Wondering what you're doing. Don't go out with the girls tonight I will turn to drink, Wondering what you're proving. [2x] Tug of war Sweet as sin I let go I fell in Feel the pull Call your name I'm alone Once again You seem too good, Too good to be true. You're holding me stronger, Stronger than I'm used to. Don't go out with the boys tonight I won't sleep a wink, Wondering what you're doing. Don't go out with the girls tonight I will turn to drink, Wondering what you're proving. Tug of war Sweet as sin I let go I fell in Feel the pull Call your name I'm alone Once again Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight) Sweet as sin (You seem too good) I let go (Too good to be true) I fell in Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight) (I'm loving you longer) Call your name (I will turn to drink) I'm alone Once again (Longer than I'm used to) Tug of war (Don't go out with the boys tonight) Sweet as sin (You seem too good) I let go (Too good to be true) I fell in Feel the pull (Don't go out with the girls tonight) (You seem too good) Call your name (I will turn to drink) I'm alone Once again (Too good to be true) (Tug of war) (Feel the pull) (Don't go out with the boys tonight) (Tug of war) (Feel the pull) \" I pulled back from the mic and the class cheered loudly. I smiled in relief and stood from the stool, turning to Lisa as she rose from the piano bench \"That was easier than I thought it would be\" I sighed. She chuckled and shrugged. \"I told you it would be. Now c'mon, there's still a few people left\" she said linking her left arm through my right. I smiled and nodded, both of us exiting the stage back into the rows of chairs. \"Very good girls! Beautiful both of you\" Mrs Davies exclaimed nodding. I bit my lip smiling and sat down in my seat, Lisa sitting down to my left \"Now, who's left?\" she asked turning back to the rest of the class. A hand rose and I sighed quietly \"Ah, Mr La-Violet. Let's hear it\" she said looking down at her clipboard. He got to his feet and hopped up onto the stage, looking very cocky. \"Alright, this song is for Gabriella Ramirez even though she hates these cheesy cliché acts\" he announced through the mic while pointing to me. My eyes widened as a few heads glanced back at me \"I'm so sorry, and I hope you'll take me back. Even though I've been a jerk to you. This is for you babe\" he said smirking slightly. I nodded with still wide eyes as he started playing. \"She's like the wind, Through my tree. She rides the night, Next to me. She leads me through moonlight, Only to burn me with the sun. She's taken my heart, She doesn't know what she's done Baby please. I feel her breath in my face (baby I can feel) Her body close to me (her body close to me) Can't look in her eyes (can't look in your eyes) She's outta my league (she's outta my league oh) Just a fool to believe She's got everything I need. She's like the wind Girl I look in the mirror, And all I see. Is a young old man with only a dream (ooo oh oh) Am I just fooling myself. Thinkin' she'll stop the pain Living without her I'd go insane Feel her breath on my face (baby I can feel) Her body close to me (her body close, yes I do) Can't look in her eyes (cant look in her eyes) She's outta of my league (she's outta my league oh) Just a fool to believe She got everything I need She's like the wind\" He stopped playing and like before with me and Lisa, the class cheered loudly. They probably found the whole thing romantic, and if I was being honest...so did I. He was right on one thing, I did hate cliché acts like this. But when he did it he made it look really hot, and I was very attracted to him right now...despite my brain protesting. \"That was very good Gabe, very dramatic introduction but good\" Mrs Davies said shaking her head. I giggled in amusement as he shrugged. \"Thanks, but I still need an answer Gabb's\" he said through the mic. Every head in the room turned to me and my eyes once again widened \"C'mon beautiful. Give me another shot, I swear I won't blow it this time\" he said drawing an X over his chest. I smiled and sighed in thought. \"I don't know...\" I hesitated shrugging slightly. \"Say yes!\" The class shouted impatiently. I jumped and rolled my eyes before getting to my feet. \"Calm down\" I exclaimed making my way towards the stage. He turned to face me as I walked up the small steps to the stage. \"So?\" he asked putting down his guitar. I tilted my head and sighed while crossing my arms. \"You promise not to be a jerk?\" I asked raising my eyebrows. He nodded. \"I promise\" \"You promise not to diss out my friends?\" \"I promise\" he said slowly walking towards me. \"And do you promise, to never do something like this again?\" I asked in a whispered tone as we suddenly became an inch apart. He chuckled and leaned his forehead against mine. \"I promise\" he said before placing one hand on my neck and crushing his lips against my own. The class cheered again as I wrapped my arms around his neck, he ran his hands down to my thighs and hoisted me up against him. My legs locked around his waist as out kiss became more heated. \"Okay, enough of that! Let's keep it PG\" Mrs Davies exclaimed both amused and serious. I giggled as we both pulled back slightly. \"I have something else for you\" he said smiling. I narrowed my eyes in confusion and he lowered me to my feet \"Turn around\" he instructed. I tilted my head but turned my back to him. In a few seconds something cold fell onto my chest, I gasped and looked down to see a familiar 'G' symbol. I smiled and pulled my hair out so that it was no longer tucked inside my necklace. \"You kept it\" I said turning back to face him. He shrugged. \"You know I never get rid of anything\" he said tilting his own head. I smiled and wrapped my arms around his waist, resting my head against his chest. His arms rested around my shoulders as he placed his chin on the top of my head. I sighed in content hugging him tighter...maybe school wouldn't be so bad after all. Author's Note: I hope you enjoyed the story as this is infact the last chapter, thank you for reviewing it really helped keep the story going. Anyway I hope you enjoyed this chapter.

His brown eyes looked into hers and they felt a connection. They both were smiling and held each other close while dancing. Her arms wrapped around his neck and his hands placed on her waist. Tara's life was getting better and better. She finally accepted herself for who she was and gained the confidence that was buried inside of her. She used to feel like just a face in the crowd that no one would remember, but things were different now. She finally let that person inside of her break those chains and throw the mask she was hiding behind to the side. She didn't start the show only for her...she did it for the many other people who felt lost. \"Tara...\" she heard Gavin say and she melted a bit inside just by hearing her name. His voice was soothing and addicting. Her heart started pounding faster within her chest. \"I'm sorry.\" She then looked at him bewildered. She became all nervous again hearing those words. Sorry for what? The question was poking at her mind. Her mind started running to all of the possibly conclusions and she was not liking it. She prayed he wouldn't say 'I'm sorry, this isn't going to work out.' For years and years she wanted to be with him. \"What...What are you sorry for?\" she choked out nervously and tensed in his arms. What if the perfect night would be ruined? \"I'm sorry it took me so long to realize you. To realize how much you mean to me.\" she noticed it was tough for him to get those words out, he was looking at the ground the entire time he said them. She then placed her hand on his cheek and made him look her in the eyes. Those brown eyes looked back. Her mind went blank. \"Gavin...it doesn't matter to me when you realized me or not. I know you care now and nothing will change that. The past is in the past, and I just want to focus on the present. Being here with you, right now, is the best feeling in the world.\" she said with a smile. Those words she said she didn't need to think...her heart just spoke the words for her. That sweet smile came back to his face. Oh, how she loved that smile. \"You're right. If I could be dancing with anyone right now, I'm glad it's you. You taught me so many things over this past week...things I'll never forget. When I thought I was alone, you were the one who was there for me. I hope you know I'll always be there for you too.\" she then started blushing wildly. She couldn't stop. She opened her mouth ready to respond and before she knew it he was leaning in to kiss her. The boy of her dreams and even more was about to kiss her. She couldn't believe it. She then closed her eyes and leaned in towards him. He gently pulled her closer their lips inches apart planning on closing the gap between them...she was nervous, she never kissed a boy before, but this wasn't just any boy. This was Gavin. The guy who was always kind to her and made her worries fade away. There foreheads were now pressed together, lips even closer. They both desired each other. \"Tara!\" she heard someone shout from behind her interrupting their moment. She sighed and Gavin let out a small laugh. Gavin then moved the hand that was touching her cheek and took her hand. He grabbed it without a thought, like it was the most natural thing to do in the world. She got this tingly sensation through out her whole body. The boy she was crushing on for years was holding her hand... \"Hello, Mrs. Adams. It's very nice to finally meet you, I'm Gavin. \" Gavin said and released his grip from Tara's hand to shake her mothers. Tara was silently praying that her mother wouldn't embarrass her. She already has been through enough humiliation over the past eighteen years. \"Trust me, I know who you are.\" Her mother said with a laugh. Tara knew what was coming next. Her bones inside her body were shaking. She was going to be even more embarrassed than usual. Her mother always had the worst timing at saying things. \"Mom...why did you come over here?\" she said as politely as possible, cutting her mother off. She just wanted her mother to shoo so she can finally get the chance to get to know Gavin better. She had been crushing on him for more than ten years, she felt like she was truly in love with him. She just wanted a chance. \"I was just going to tell you that Rob and I are leaving and were wondering if you needed a ride?\" that was the least thing Tara wanted to hear. She just wanted to dance with Gavin the whole night and hated the idea of it ending short. Gavin was one of those people who helped her crawl out of her shell. She finally got the opportunity and strength to break out of her shell and didn't ever want to reenter. That shy girl would always be a piece of her, but she loved showing her true self. Speaking her mind and not letting anything stop her was this whole new experience for her that she didn't want to let go of. She was tired of being in the dark. \"Actually, Mrs. Adams, I was hoping I could walk Tara home, if that's alright with you?\" Gavin said and flashed Tara a smile. He was such a gentleman. Her heart was pounding faster and she felt like flying. She felt so blithe inside. Tara looked at him her eyes so bright , the lights from above reflecting in them. \"I think I'm liking him already...\" Tara's mom stated and then walked over to Rob. Tara turned to Gavin slightly blushing with embarrassment. \"I'm sorry ab-\" \"No, need to say sorry. Moms are moms.\" Gavin said with a chuckle. What was it about him? He just knew exactly what to say. \"Please, you only got a bit of her right now, wait till she eavesdrops on our conversations. She's probably going to ask me all the deets when I get home.\" She said laughing back while pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. Tara loved her mom, but her mom and her were two different people. Her mom was a chartreuse type of girl and she wasn't. Tara was a more deeper person than her mom. Tara looked at things differently, but she was thankful that her mom always supported her though the choices she made in her life. Her mother tried. She might not of always gotten it, but at least she tried. \"I think I can survive...\" Gavin said with a smile and held out his arm for her. This made her blush even more than before. Her body got all heated and she was wordless. He was a perfect gentleman and the way he looked at her made her know that he would never do anything to hurt her. She took his arm and lightly giggled. They quickly said a goodbye to their friends and on the way home Tara ended up having Gavin's jacket draped over her shoulders. They couldn't stop talking. Anything that came to their mind they could talk about. They understood each other perfectly. They connected on so many different levels. They laughed, they smiled, and they talked seriously about things as well. \"So...I guess this is it.\" Gavin said walking Tara up to the porch of her house. Tara was bummed that the night was ending, but glad this new chapter was opening. Being there with Gavin felt so right. \"I guess so...\" Tara said quietly as their eyes met. His deep brown eyes put her in a trance as they both made direct contact. His eyes were warm and so inviting. She felt dizzy looking into them...like she was walking on air. Next thing she knew they were both leaning in again. Gavin gently brought his hand up to her cheek. They both felt an electric shock run through their bodies just by the smallest touch. They were so close they could feel each others breath. They both were nervous. There was tension in the air. They heard a door creeping open and they both quickly jumped back shocked. They both looked to see who it was and it was Tara's mother...or in Tara's head she was now called 'the moment killer.' \"Hello, Mrs. Adams.\"Gavin said nervously hoping Tara's mother didn't get a glimpse of what almost happened on the porch. Truth was, he could be very shy like Tara and embarrassed easily. Tara and Gavin weren't so different that way. Gavin still looked at himself as that awkward kid with a guitar jamming out with his buddies in his garage. Gavin was an adorkable guy. \"Hello, Gavin.\" Mrs. Adams said to Gavin directly with a grin on her face and then turned to Tara. \" Tara, sweetie, I think it's time to come inside.\" Tara nodded and turned her attention back at Gavin. \"Goodnight, Tara.\" Gavin said and put out his hand for her to shake. She thought the gesture was cute and giggled as she shook his hand. \"I'll see you soon, Gavin.\" Tara said back with her best smile. Gavin nodded and started walking down the stairs and then Tara discovered that she still had his jacket. The jacket that smelled of his cologne that engulfed her in pure bliss. \"Gavin, wait!\" She said running down the stairs of the porch. He turned around and looked at her puzzled. \"You forgot your jacket.\" She said taking the jacket off putting her hand out to give it to him and he just looked at her. \"Keep it, I'll get it later.\" he said with a smile and turned around and walked off. Tara just looked at him dazzled as he disappeared into the darkness of the starry night. So, there's a little intro. Sorry, I haven't been on, I have been dealing with some personal stuff along with school, but now school is OUT and I am ready to write! I have so many stories in mind and I can't wait to get them down on paper for y'all. I also have video's in mind for those who are into my youtube channel. Also, who's excited for the Radio Rebel DVD release on the 19th? I know I am! Pick up that stuff.[Chapter 2] Radio Rebel Perfection Chapter 2: Both Ways After Gaivn left, Tara decided to go inside. After her mom bombarded her with several questions from different directions, she went upstairs to her room. When she got there she couldn't stop herself from screaming inside her pillow at the top of her lungs in merriment. Why was she so happy? Well, for one she finally gained up the courage to take a stance. She stood up for herself. Her whole life society had made her out to be an outcast, they pushed her into the shadows, made her crawl to the tiniest of corners in terror, she was always the one observing a world that seemed so far away. One that was untouchable. She finally made contact with it though. She gained the strength to reach out and make her voice be heard, finally touching the untouchable. She made an impact on that little world. She helped people. People started opening their eyes and started realizing they aren't so different. They realized that society didn't define them, they defined themselves. They could be anyone they desired to be. They were a unstoppable force. Limits weren't existent. Boundaries were no longer preventing them from where they wanted to take their life. Tara just needed people to know that, and unintentionally, somewhere along the way, Tara discovered who she was by helping others. She put her heart into something and even though the path to making people see the light was bumpy along with the several twists and turns, she did it. She made their differences bring people together again. She used her voice and screamed as loud as she could until those walls that were built so strongly were just fragments of their past that no longer subsisted in their world. On the other hand there was Gavin. His name repeated in her mind over and over...she was always crushing on him, but all of a sudden that crush turned into something more than she could of ever envision. It turned into love. To her, Gavin used to be that fairy tale guy. She never thought he would turn into that guy in real life though. She always imagined Gavin as being one of those guys who would probably move onto bigger and better things, one of those guys who would end up to have a girlfriend like Stacy. Because of those misconception she was always afraid to talk to him, but this year something changed. She got to know him better and came to discover Gavin wasn't that jerk guy who focused on more material things and cliques. He didn't do things just for himself. Gavin was more open hearted and cared for people. He didn't let the opinions of others take control over who he talked to and what he did. Gavin was Gavin. Completely perfect in her eyes. Tara would never forget what Gaivn had done for her. If it wasn't for Gavin, Tara would probably have still been in the dark. Gavin not only impacted Tara, but she impacted him. They both helped each other grow into the best person they could be. They both knew what they stood for. Now, they could stand for that together. They both never needed to feel alone when they had each other. They both made each other see what was in front of them. A knock on the door interrupted Tara's thoughts and made her groan. She just wanted to go off dreaming of things that she could do next, things on how she can spread love over an even further distance. She sat up on her bed and got up and opened the door and all she saw was a wave of color zoom past her and shut the door with a slam. \"How was walking home with Gavin? Did he finally kiss you? Oh my gosh, he kissed you, didn't he? Was it as magical as you imagined?\" Audrey couldn't stop talking. Her mouth was moving as fast as a race car. Some of the words came out so fast Tara wasn't sure if Audrey was even talking English. \"No, not yet...\" Tara said with a sigh and sat back down on her bed. Audrey stood in front of her with her hands on her hips. \"And why not? I thought he liked you!\" \"He does, it's just that the times he tried, we were interrupted...\" \"Well, do you want him to kiss you?\" \"Of course, but it's going to happen when it's going to happen, I am in no rush, just knowing that he has mutual feelings is enough.\" Audrey then laughed a bit and Tara then looked at her confused. \"You should really hear the things you say in your sleep...\" Tara then looked at Audrey with her eyes completely widened. She wanted to say something, but it felt like her tongue was completely tied, it was like something was lodged in her throat. She didn't know exactly how to respond to that. \"I...I do not!\" Tara said nervously. Did she talk about Gavin in her sleep? She had no idea... \"Denial is the first step in the wrong direction, Tara. Trust me, the hyena knows.\" \"Well, maybe the hyena is wrong.\" \"The hyena is never wrong.\" Audrey stated clearly and then exited without another word. Tara jumped off her bed and then looked down the stair case and before she could blink, Audrey was out the door. From the look on Audrey's face before she left she could tell that Audrey was going to do something. When Audrey wanted something done, she wouldn't stop...Tara hoped that Audrey wouldn't meddle...was hope enough though? Tara went back to her room and just collapsed on the bed. She wondered what was going through Audrey's head...She looked at the clock and realized the time. She was exhausted and just wanted to sleep...whatever she had to deal with, she would in the morning. Right now, she just wanted some time to herself. MORP was one of the best things that ever happened to her. She just wondered how everyone would treat her when she went in for school on Monday...especially Moreno. Moreno probably hated her guts because she got away with being Radio Rebel...she just knew Monday was going to be the start of an interesting school week. A school week that could go both ways...[Chapter 3] Radio Rebel Perfection Original Thinking After Audrey left Tara's house, she knew what she had to do. She was the hyena, and when there was an opportunity to pounce on, she didn't put her claws down. She was to get to the bottom of any problem, her mind was bursting with ideas. According to all the romance novels and plays she has read, the kiss told everything, it had to be perfect. Audrey started heading down the street to Gavin's house. She was becoming the conductor of their life, the puppet master. In her mind, she was doing them a favor. She was looking out for her best friend. Everything she was planning to do was all with good intentions. Audrey approached the doorstep of Gavin's house and knocked on the door and came face to face with Gavin's mother. Her mother had long black hair and brown eyes and a gentle smile that creept along her face. It was like seeing Gavin's clone on the front step. \"How may I help you?\" Gavin's mother said very calmly, her voice had this soothing tone. \"I was wondering if Gavin was home? I just need to quickly talk to him about something...school related.\" Audrey said trying to hide the truth. She didn't want to get Gavin's mother thrown into the mix. The less questions, the better off the plan was. \"Oh, of course, but isn't it a little late?\" \"Well...we are working on a project together and Gavin took my notes, and I was on the way home, and I thought, why not?\" Audrey said improvising. She was passionate about acting and selling what she was said. \"If you say so, come on in, dear.\" Gavin's mother said politely moving out of the way so Audrey could enter the house and she did so. The house was pretty big, there were two floors. There was a grand piano in the living room and it had a small tv. This house was all about the music. She could tell immediately Gavin's family got him into it all. After looking around the house a bit Audrey decided to go upstairs to Gavin's room. When she got there she gingerly knocked on the door. She was going to make a point, one that she would make sure he would understand. Gavin opened the door and saw Audrey standing in front of him and just looked at her with confusion. Why would Audrey of all people be here at this time of night? Didn't she have to go home? Wouldn't her parents be concerned? Questions were running through his head and nothing could put them to a halt. \"Audrey, why are you here?\" Gavin said finally speaking up, before he could say another word, Audrey pushed passed him, and walked in his room. She seemed to be doing that a lot lately tonight. \"I need to talk to you about something important, that is why I am here.\" Audrey said closing the door and then her eyes wandered to the flag. \"What's with the flag?\" \"Beatles.\" Gavin simply said. \"But that's not the point, what's so important that you have to tell me at eleven at night?\" \"I have to talk to you about the Tara and you situation.\" Audrey's arms were now crossed and she was looking directly at Gavin. His face started to get more and more screwy as those words slipped off her tongue. He was standing there completely perplexed. \"The Tara and me situation?\" Gavin said slowly trying to absorb the words. What situation? He thought everything was going great between Tara and him. As he said those words, it was like they had no meaning. Just a bunch of different words jumbled together in a sentence. \"Yes, that's what I said. See, the thing about Tara is that she hasn't had her first kiss, so, since you're her boyfriend after that song, and the confessions of your mushy gushy feelings, you're the one.\" \"Still not seeing the point here.\" \"The point is, that the kiss needs to be perfect, and it's my job as her friend to ensure that it is.\" \"You have to be kidding me...is this some weird girl thing?\" Gavin said shaking his head and chucked in disbelief. \"Audrey, I don't think you should be concerned over what happens between Tara and I...especially that.\" \"Hey, I'm just trying to help you here, see, a girl's first kiss with a guy she likes tells everything. It's a new feeling and there's electricity and since you're not only the new boyfriend, but you're also the first boyfriend which makes you the one to give the first, first kiss. If it goes wrong, the relationship could be doomed.\" \"Wow, I completely don't feel pressure at all.\" Gavin said looking at the ground thinking. He suddenly felt uneasy and his head was pounding. There was so much stuff that he didn't know and now that he knew this...it changed things from his perspective. He wanted to keep Tara as his girlfriend. \"Just do it right, and you will have nothing to be concerned about...do it wrong and...well...I don't think you would like that answer.\" With that Audrey left feeling positive that Gavin got the point. The fear in his eyes and concern showed her everything that she needed to know. Everything was starting to form together. The day was Monday. A beginning of a new school week. When Tara woke up this morning she felt as if the alarm clock was beleaguering her. She didn't know what to expect. Life was reforming and she had to come to peace with that idea. She was able to acknowledge that she was a different and that she was more capable to do anything she wanted to, but she was worried that everyone else wouldn't take her in with open arms and go along for the new journey. How would people react when she walked through those double doors? What if some people's opinions changed since Morp? What if they didn't? Life was a roll of the die for her now. She had to keep herself on her toes at all times and expect the unexpected. Dodge the curve balls. She just hoped she was quick enough. Another thing that kept creeping into her mind was Audrey...She had no hypothesis as to what she was planning. Tara just needed to talk to her as soon as possible. Audrey always had good heart behind everything she did, but sometimes she could over do it. After years of knowing Audrey, they could read each other like books. They always had each other backs. On the positive note, she was looking forward to one thing. Gavin. Gavin conceived who she was in a way no one else could. When she was that quiet girl or that girl who could form a rally of people, he was there. At the beginning, she doubted that, but in the end, she learned the truth. She couldn't believe she was finally able to say Gavin Morgan was her boyfriend, but also one of her closest friends. Tara made her way through the hallways as quickly as possible until she spotted Audrey at her locker. She needed to sort out this whole situation. She didn't need any drama in her life. She just wanted to enjoy every moment of being a teenager and being herself. She didn't want that all pulled away. \"Audrey, we need to talk!\" she said and Audrey turned to her with curiosity. \"Well, good morning to you everything alright?\" Audrey said raising an eyebrow. She seemed completely clueless. Like everything that happened after Morp didn't occur. \"You know when you came over? Audrey, whatever you are planning, please, don't do it.\" Tara was literally begging at this point. She was ready to fall to her knees and grovel, anything, you name it. \"Who said I am planning anything?\" Audrey said while she closed her locker avoiding eye contact with Tara. This was a sure sign that Audrey had something going on in her head. \"Audrey...\" \"What? I'm being completely honest. Don't you think you should trust your best friend?\" Audrey questioned and this made Tara feel a little guilty. It's just all the evidence didn't look so good. \"I do trust you...it's just...\" Tara said stumbling over her words. Audrey gave her a look that wasn't the most comforting. \"Tara, just trust me on this, will you? I'm not going to do anything you don't want me to.\" Tara then nodded. She could count on Audrey for anything, and if Audrey said she wouldn't do anything, she wouldn't. \"Fine...if you say so.\" \"Great, now that this topic is over, Gavin's walking this way.\" Audrey signaled to the tall dark haired boy with the smile that could bring light to any room. \"Now, I'm going to go so you two lovebirds can have some alone time.\" \"Alone time? But what if I say something stupid? He's my first boyfriend, what if I screw it up?\" Being nervous wasn't a new thing for Tara. \"Just keep in mind, Gavin likes you for you, alright? He wouldn't have admitted it if he didn't. As far as he's concerned, anything and everything that comes out of your mouth is perfect. You can do no wrong in his eyes.\" Tara nodded in comprehension. This was her first boyfriend, she didn't want to slip up over her own feet. \"What are you ladies talking about?\" Gavin said placing his hand against one of the lockers. Tara jumped completely out of her skin. She just couldn't keep her thoughts in place. \"No one, I mean, nothing.\" Tara said turning around to face him and their eyes met on accident once again. \"If you say so.\" He said smiling at her with a small laugh that came out of his mouth. It was music to her ears. \"Well, I have to go take care of some things. Those things being two nerdy and obsessive twins. I'll talk to you guys later.\" Audrey said with one last smile and walked off after closing her locker. Tara and Gavin both said goodbye and then went back to talking. \"So, mind if I walk you to class?\" Gavin said sweetly, the way he looked at her made her get melt. \"No, not at all, actually. I would really like that.\" She said and he then took her books from her hands without a word. Tara blushed from his manners, he was such a gentleman. \"Gavin, you don't have to carry those.\" Tara said simply. She was capable of doing things on her own, even though they were dating, she didn't want him to feel like it was his job to do that. \"I know I don't have to, I want to. There's a difference.\" Tara then shook her head and laughed. \"I'm not going to get those back no matter what I say , am I?\" Tara said smiling while pointing to the books that now were placed in his hand. \"You so get me.\" Gavin said with a laugh. \"Then, I am going to do this.\" Tara then took the bottom half of the books that were his and smirked. \"Seriously?\" \"Seriously.\" They both then started laughing at each other's silliness. They both made each other feel blessed. They could share laughs together and secret smiles. After all, laughter is the good for the soul. \"So, I have to ask you a question?\" Gavin said releasing one hand from his books and grabbing Tara's as they started walking down the narrow hall. Their hands fit in each other's perfectly like the last two pieces of a puzzle. The warmth from each other's hands made them feel all goey inside. Tara then looked up at him with a smile across her face. \"What is your question?\" \"I was wondering if we could...well, are you busy this Saturday?\" Gavin finally blurted out after trying to find the perfect words. \"Actually, I'm free since I have the shows from Monday to Friday, why do you ask?\" Tara said oblivious to the fact Gavin was clearly asking her on another date. \"I was wondering if I could take you on a date, I would really like to get to know you a little bit better.\" Gavin said with a grin looking into her deep brown eyes that sparkled. \"That sounds like a plan. A awesome one at that too.\" Tara said as her heart started beating faster in her chest as she looked down trying to discontinue her crazy blushing. \"Great, that's...great. It's a date. \" Gavin said with one of the hugest grins on his face. His smile made her smile. He then kissed her on the cheek. \"Can I have my books back or do you want to explain to my teacher why you have them?\" Gavin said jokingly. \"I don't know, the more you learn the better.\" she said teasing him a bit and then she gave him his books and said their goodbyes. Tara opened the door to the classroom and all everyone greeted her warmly, they noticed her, but in a good way, some people actually thanked her for making them stand up for themselves. Making them notice that they are unstoppable. Maybe, this week would go the right way instead of what she originally thought. A/N So, what did you all think? I would love to know (:[Chapter 4] Radio Rebel Perfection The Text I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CHARACTERS. Gavin headed towards his next class. He only had a little amount of time to get there. He was still smiling from his conversation with Tara. He didn't know why he was so worried. Tara and him had a connection, nothing that he would do would break that bond. All of a sudden he felt a tight grip on his arm that yanked him back. This incident shocked him. He was thrown off completely. He then was faced with the person who did it. He thought it was Moreno getting ready to holler at him for not being class earlier. He figured she would still be bitter from having the students turn against her at MORP, but it was someone completely different. The person he was face to face with was familiar. It was Audrey. \"Audrey, I can't talk now, I'm going to be late.\" Gavin said trying to get by her, but she kept moving in front of him. For a short little thing, she was persistent and strong. She wasn't going to let him get away so easily. She had words that needed to be said. Like it or not, Gavin would have to listen. \"Tell them your locker was jammed or something.\" Audrey said and Gavin groaned. \"Do you know how ridiculous you're being?\" Gavin was now extremely irritated. Usually, he was reasonable, but this was too much for him. \"So, are you saying making Tara happy is ridiculous?\" Audrey stated crossing her arms and looked at him. Her eyes narrowing down on him making him feel the judgement. \"Audrey, don't twist my words like that. You know I would do anything to make Tara happy. I am just saying– \" Gavin started, but then was suddenly cut off by the sound of the school bell. He sighed with impatience. \"Just answer my question, did you ask her out or not?\" Audrey responded immediately after the bell. Gavin couldn't even get the chance to complete his sentence. Audrey wanted to make her point loud and clear. \"Yes, I asked her out...\" \"Good, now, where are you taking her?\" Audrey said coming closer which caused him to squirm. He knew that anything he said would be considered 'wrong' in her eyes. \"I was thinking pizza and a movie.\" \"WRONG.\" Audrey then made a buzzer sound. Just as Gavin predicted... \"Why not? Food is a good way to start a conversation. Especially if we see the movie first. Then we could have something to talk about.\" \"Gavin...I doubt Tara would be okay with having her first kiss in a pizza shop.\" \"Maybe I should let you organize the date instead.\" Gavin snapped back. All of this was beginning to stress him out. It was like Audrey was the writer of his life. Creating the perfect fairy tale. He was surprised he wasn't in a suit of armor yet. \"Gavin...this has to be from you. It would be more meaningful. Again, this date has to say something.\" \"...I don't think nuts can talk.\" Gavin said with a laugh trying to lighten the mood. He then got a glare that made his laugh just a faint memory. \"It will, Audrey. I just have to think of something. I can handle this.\" \"You better.\" With that Audrey left and Gavin rushed to class... Gavin was sitting in his class and was gazing out the window spending a lot of time in his own head. Audrey's words kept stewing inside his brain. He was impatiently tapping his pencil against the desk again and again repeatedly. He couldn't stop. He was proud of himself that he finally took the step forward to ask Tara out on another date, but this date had expectations. Expectations he had to live up to. He couldn't let it fall apart drowning him. What was he thinking of exactly? He was thinking about how he was going to set up this whole romantic moment and woo her. Make an impression on her and let her know that he is the one for her. He was just waiting for that bell to ring signaling lunch. He needed to go outside and take in the fresh air. He needed to put in his headphones and make the whole world around him disappear. He crossed his fingers that, that relaxing would form some idea. When the bell did go off, he ran out the door. His throat was getting dry and he could feel his palms sweating. With one look at him, you could tell that he was nervous. It was so easy to tell that he was acting differently. He had to disguise it though, when he was around Tara. He didn't want her to catch onto anything that was happening. If she knew what was occurring, the whole plan would be ruined...well, not the entire plan. He still didn't even know what he was going to do for most of the plan, but that wasn't the point. The point was that he had to think. Had to think really hard about everything. If he made one imprudent mood, all of the dominoes that were being perfectly aligned would tip over. On the other side, Tara was exiting the doors of the school and headed towards their regular lunch table. She couldn't contain her excitement about it all. She never had been in a real relationship before and didn't know much, but with Gavin, she didn't think it would be that hard. They both cared about each other and that is what mattered most at the end of the day. She sat next to Larry and Barry and was beaming as she searched for Audrey. She had to tell her all the details about how Gavin asked her out. Tara's heart was flying. She could feel the beats getting faster. Just even the thought of it all, had that effect on her. She was all giggly inside. It was a new feeling and she loved it. She hoped it would be a feeling that would be around for a long time. When Audrey finally arrived at the table she was wearing a smile on her face and fixed her red specs that she has grown attached to. Fashion should be functional. Audrey was definitely a little eccentric, but that is why her friends loved her. All of her friends weren't afraid to be who they were. Tara has a special bond with her friends. They could relate to each other and talk about anything. They were the people that Tara could confide in most. \"What's up with you, Smiley?\" Audrey said asking Tara casually. She knew the real reason, but had to play it off like she didn't. She didn't want to give Tara any ideas. She wanted Tara to be surprised by the moment she was going to have. Wanted Tara to be unprepared for it. Wanted the pieces to fall just in place for her friend. \"Guess what! Guess what!\" Tara said jumping up and down in her seat. Larry and Barry looked at their friend with confusion. They never saw Tara so energetic and vocal like this. Never saw her unafraid to let the whole school hear her voice. \"I don't know, what?\" Audrey said with a shrug. \"Gavin asked me out!\" \"Not to interrupt, but didn't he already do that?\" Barry said as he started snagging food off his brothers tray. In response, Larry smacked his hand away. Tara would never understand how boys could eat so much. \"It's different. This is there SECOND date. The first was just an introduction.\" Audrey quickly responded. She was such a romantic at heart. The drama side definitely influenced the way she perceived things. \" and that's so great that he asked you out! How did he do it?\" \"Well, we were on our way to class and then–\" \"Talking about me?\" Tara immediately froze when she heard a deep, manly, and familiar voice that came from behind her. She closed her eyes and then turned around to see Gavin. \"Uhhh...h-hi.\" She said barely making out the word. He always showed up at the worst times possible. \"Mind if I sit with my beautiful girlfriend?\" Gavin said with a smile which made her blush. Gavin didn't mind that she was talking about him one bit. She didn't say anything bad about him, so there was no reason to be angered at her. \"Not at all.\" Tara said and moved over and Gavin took the spot on the end across from Audrey. He could once again could feel her gaze. Those eyes pouring into his skin. He felt more and more uncomfortable by the second. He knew Audrey had good intentions, but nothing he would do would make her stop. \"So, I was wondering if I could walk you home from school?\" Gavin said as he reached for Tara's hand intertwining her delicate fingers with his. Feeling the smooth skin on her hand. He loved the warmth of her hand in his. \"That sounds great. I would really enjoy that. Planning on carrying my books then, too?\" Tara said with a laugh that made him melt inside. It was so beautiful. So adorable. It was the best sound he had ever heard. \"Maybe.\" Just the presence of Tara made everything in his life light up. She made him feel something he never felt before. Something that made him want more and more of it. He knew that he could not live without her now. All of a sudden Gavin's phone went off signaling that he had a text message. He took it out and looked at the screen then he read the name. He should of knew. His eyes went up from the phone to Audrey. It was from her. He assumed texting was another skill she obtained. Gavin opened the text and read it when Tara wasn't looking. He took in every word: \"Don't make a move later.\" The text message clearly said. It was as direct as possible. He then nodded at Audrey in understanding. He wouldn't mess this up. \"Tara, I have to go meet Gabe. I'll see you later?\" \"That sounds great.\" Tara responded not leaving contact from his eyes. With that, Gavin left. He had to do this right. He wanted Tara to know how special she was. If giving her that fairytale first kiss was the way to do it, he would. Her happiness mattered most. I GREATLY apologize for my lack of updates. school started. I'm trying my best. I will make sure I'll update more. promise. this story has a lot more to tell. (: for those who are still following the story, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. (:[Chapter 5] Radio Rebel Perfection Getting Harder Gavin finally exited the cafeteria and started heading towards his locker. He didn't really need to meet Gabe. He just needed an excuse to get away from Audrey. He didn't want to show Tara how nervous he was around her. He had to pretend like everything was normal. That it was just an average day in Seattle. Gavin didn't consider having secrets as a bad thing. It was just something someone was containing inside their brain until it was time to be told. Timing was important. He had to have the perfect timing during this upcoming date. But there was still one problem. He had no idea where he was going to take her. Time was running out on the clock. The calendar had only seven days in a week. How he wished their was more days or hours in a day. He had to think and put his heart into this date. He had to push his worries that were developing in his mind away. He had to bury those. He had to stop listening with his head and had to start listening with his heart. As Gavin was walking down the hall, he saw something that caught his eye. All of a sudden, an idea sparked. He finally got something that would be meaningful and would leave an impression on Tara. Ideas kept coming in his mind. Bursting. Why didn't he think of this before? The smile on his face grew. It was perfect. There was nothing about it he would change. The stage was the perfect place. He could set up a picnic and they could just talk about music and things that interested them. He could put up lights and decorate the stage to give it a more romantic and cozy feel. He could write a song for her and make her feel loved. Let her know that he will always be dedicated and in love with her. Why the stage exactly? He had several reasons as to why. For one it was the moment where he looked into those deep brown beautiful eyes and realized she was special. That there was more to her than what people thought. It was the moment where he wanted her. The moment he fell in love with her. Her eyes told him everything he needed to know. He could feel the chemistry between them. In that moment, it was undeniable. That was the moment where she left his mark on his heart. She made a mark that could never be destroyed. Another reason was because when they were on that stage, there was a reason. That reason was because of a project. A project that finally let him and Tara get to know each other. She wasn't just a random face in the hallway anymore. They knew each other on a more personal level. If it wasn't for that project, all the pieces wouldn't of had fell in place the way they did. The last reason was because when they were rehearsing the lines, they were so close to kissing. He was so close to feeling Tara's lips against him and enjoying the moment completely. So close to pure bliss. He would now be able to give her the kiss she missed. Make up for it. He would be able to kiss the right girl on that stage instead of the wrong one. There was one flaw in his entire plan though which could possibly make everything fall to pieces. The thing that would cause him the most trouble would be the fact that there was a woman who had complete control over the school. Who had the power. Who was probably still bitter about earlier events. That person is Principal Moreno. He knew that if she found out what he was doing, his whole plan would fall apart and be ripped into tiny pieces. That there would be no way to put it all back together away. He had to be sneaky. He had to make sure she would be no where near that area during their date. An idea was born, but life kept throwing stones in his path forming a wall. Later that day, the fell finally rang dismissing class. Everyone started pushing their way through the crowded hallways trying to exit the building as soon as possible. People were squished in between the tight walls. Trying to sneak around corners and bodies. Doing anything possible to get where they were going. When Gavin finally reached Tara at his locker he sighed with relief. \"Hey, I'm still walking you home, right?\" Gavin said reaching for the books in her locker. She then quickly snatched it up and looked at him. \"Nice try.\" She said with a smile. Gavin in return started shaking his head at her and laughed. \"Tara, you're killing the art of chivalry. If I am your knight in shining armor, you should let me do this.\" \"But you're not my knight. You're my prince charming.\" Tara said with a teasing smile placed on her angelic face. \"You found a loophole…lucky for you, I will be more careful with my phrasing for next time.\" Once Tara closed her locker and gathered her belongings, Gavin reached for her hand. Their fingers were touching gently. They both felt a tickling sensation inside them. A sensation that made them get butterflies in their stomach and heads become dizzy. A sensation that made their heart beat faster. They could feel warmth and comfort even the most simplest of touches. Tara and Gavin were laughing and talking the entire walk. After many efforts at trying to carry Tara's book's, she finally gave in and stopped resisting. The path they were walking on was a different route than usual. It was hidden under the shadows of the trees. The wind swayed the branches gently and you could hear the birds chirping. The grass was freshly cut and you could smell it in the air filling up their noses. It was the perfect setting. It was quiet. It was like nothing in the world could disturb them. Gavin wanted to spend time with her. He wanted to admire her beauty every second. He wanted to spend every moment with her. This feeling was new to him. He had crushes in the past with other girls, but with Tara, it was different. She meant the universe to him. She was different from those girls. She was different from those girls in the best possible way. He wouldn't want one thing about Tara to change. She was perfect in his eyes. \"So, how was your first school day at being Radio Rebel publicly?\" Gavin said striking up another conversation topic. He genuinely cared about her and her well-being. He wanted her to be happy. Her happiness was the thing that made him happy. He wanted her to have a life full of joy. He wanted her to have an exciting life. A life that she would be forever satisfied with. \"It was...good. I typically wouldn't say that, but it was. I've noticed people have become more open with each other. People aren't afraid to get to know each other any longer. They sincerely take interests and I love that. It's a shame it took until our senior year for people to realize that, though. Even though that didn't happen, I still think if we take the skills we learned in high school and apply them to life, we're going to go far as a generation.\" Gavin just looked at her amazed. He loved her mind so much. It intrigued him. When she talked, he couldn't restrain himself from listening. \"You're so inspiring, Tara. You really are. Your words inspire me so much. You influence the choices I make and the way I think massively. You opened up so many people's eyes. You're a person who many admire. You're the person I admire.\" Gavin said looking at her talking from his heart. All these things he was feeling couldn't be contained inside of him for any longer. She needed to know. Tara looked at Gavin completely touched. No one had ever said something so sweet like that to her. He was kind. He looked in her eyes and in that moment, Tara completely melted. She just wanted his arms to be wrapped around her so tightly that she couldn't escape. She could feel her cheeks getting hotter and she started blushing crazily. \"Uh, thank you…your music inspires me too.\" She said with a smile and then the next thing she knew Gavin's fingers were pushing back the hair that dangled in her face. This caused her heart to beat faster in her chest. Everything felt like a dream. The words he was saying and the way he touched her skin so gently. Each movement filled with care. It wasn't a dream, it was reality. A reality that she hoped would never escape her. \"I love you, Tara.\" Those four words left Gavin's lips and he took a step closer to her looking deep into her brown eyes. This was it. This was the moment she was waiting for. The moment she was waiting for with the perfect guy. She couldn't imagine her first kiss being with anyone else. \"I love you too, Gavin.\" She responded back sweetly. She was silently wishing she could pause time. Without a thought about her surroundings, she walked a step closer. Her foot then got caught onto a branch that was popping out of the ground creating a crescent shape. She then fell unable to catch herself and her and Gavin both fell straight to the ground. Gavin tried holding her up, but the surprise through him off. When they both hit the ground they started hysterically laughing at their clumsiness. \"Are you okay?\" Gavin said brushing off her back trying to get the dirt off. She then nodded. Gavin was relieved that the kiss didn't work out the way it should of. As much as he wanted to, Audrey's words kept going through his brain the entire time. He couldn't make a move. He just couldn't. The moment had to be perfect. The kiss had to be random. Plus, if Audrey knew that he broke his word, he would be criticized. She would never get over it. \"Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I can't control my feet well. I hope I didn't break my boyfriend. I shouldn't be allowed to have nice things at times like this.\" \"I certainly did have a nice trip, if it makes you feel any better.\" Gavin said with a chuckle. His laugh was contagious. It made her laugh. They both then proceeded to lay there. They weren't in a rush. The world was in their hand. Every minute was theirs. Time would be spent together. The time they shared together was precious. \"So, what are your wise words for those who have a history of falling?\" \"My advice is to wrap you in bubble wrap or cover yourself with pillows.\" Tara laughed once more. Gavin moved closer to Tara and grabbed her hand. He started playing with her tiny fingers in his hand. His fingers filling up the empty spaces between her fingers. \"I'm sure the people would take that advice. I know I would.\" \"I appreciate it.\" \"So, you basically work for your dad, right?\" Right when Gavin said that, he could feel a change about her. That the words he said didn't go over well with her. The smile was completely gone from her face. Their eye contact was loss and she was now staring up at the sky. Trying to pretend everything was fine, but Gavin sensed it wasn't. There was something completely off about her. \"I'm sorry...did I say something?\" Gavin looked at her with concern, confusion and worry clearly painted on his face. \"Well, Rob is my stepfather. My birthfather is actually in Taiwan…\" Tara said still not making eye contact with him. Her eyes were getting watery and drops were running down the side of her wasn't really open about her father. She had such a strong connection her father and then all of a sudden, that was taken away. She rarely got to talk to him. The only way they kept in contact was mostly be email. That wasn't good enough for her, though. He wanted to hear her father's voice again. She wanted things back to the way they were, but she understood that her father had to do what he had to do. \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\" Gavin said moving closer to her, holding her hand tighter trying to comfort her. \"It's fine…you can't say no to a great job. Plus, we email…it's better than nothing, y' know?\" Tara said trying to make the best of the situation. Even though she said those things, it didn't change how she felt. She was not fine and she wasn't okay. Inside she was hurting. Her dad meant the world to her. She remembered how when she was little he used to share stories with her and play games. As time passed, all that disappeared. \"I don't think it's fine…if it was fine, you wouldn't be crying.\" Gavin said placing his hand upon Tara's cheek wiping off her tears as best as he could. She tried to play it off like she wasn't, but it was too late now. \"I hope you know I will always be here to talk about anything. I love you. I would do anything to make you happy. I hope you don't forget that.\" Gavin said looking down at her. Their eyes connected and she nodded with understanding. \"We should probably start heading back.\" Tara nodded again and he got up from the ground and held out his hand for her to take. Gavin picked up Tara's backpack that was laying on the ground and started walking, but before he got a chance, Tara's arm reached out and grabbed him. They both were then hugging tightly. Not letting each other go. \"Thank you.\" Tara said softly into his shoulder. They just stood there for a few moments in silence as Gavin rubbed her back comforting her. Doing everything in his power to console her. She then pulled away and looked in his eyes and she began leaning in once more. Gavin realized this and panicked. He didn't want to pull away for no reason giving her the impression that he didn't want tot kiss her, but what was he supposed to do? \"It's getting dark out...we should hurry up.\" Gavin said and he could see the disappointment on Tara's face. It killed him. She looked crushed. He had to be more careful. He didn't want to hurt her. That wasn't his intention at all. This was going to be harder than he thought.[Chapter 6] 1Radio Rebel Talks and Favors Tara and Gavin walked home and Gavin tried to act as normal as possible, but he could tell by her face that he messed up. He didn't mean to hurt her that way. He should have just gone for it, but Audrey's words kept crawling back into his brain reminding him that he had to give Tara the perfect kiss. When Tara entered her house there was disappointment written all over her face. She didn't understand. She couldn't comprehend anything that just occurred. Was she reading his signals wrong? She thought they had a connection, but was she just kidding herself? She knew deep down it was just a kiss and there were feelings there, but...she couldn't help but thinking the worst of the situation. She just wanted to show love and be loved. Was that too much to ask for? Her mind kept bubbling with the consequences of this particular occurrence and she couldn't stop. The more she thought, the more puzzling all these events became. When she walked inside the house, she could see her mom and Rob sitting in the living room together cuddling on the couch having a moment together. She looked at them and wondered why Gavin and her couldn't be that close. They both had a thing for each other, but why was it so troublesome for them to show it? Tara sighed to herself and headed up the stairs to her room. She closed the door behind her and started playing some music to get her mind off of what happened earlier. But that didn't help. In every song, every word reminded her of Gavin. Each word said his name. Each chord did. Each melody. She was afraid of losing him. What if someone better came along? I mean, Gavin was adorable. He had those brown eyes that any girl could fall for and that cute smile that could make any girl go completely weak...he was a catch. All of a sudden Tara heard her door open up and standing there was her mother. She wanted to act like everything was completely ordinary, but right away, Tara's mother picked up something was wrong. She looked at her daughter with concern in her eyes...Tara felt them scanning over her. Observing every movement she made. \"Hey, Mom.\" Tara said cheerfully trying to play it off like something wasn't poking at her mind. It was too late though. Anything Tara said or did couldn't change mothers opinion. Just like nothing will ever change her mothers feelings about the color chartreuse. Tara's mother then closed the door behind them making sure Rob couldn't hear what was about to happen. The truth was, Tara wasn't in the mood to talk. She just knew this feeling was going to disappear eventually. \"Is something wrong, sweetie?\" her mother said in a soft and loving tone. \"I'm completely fine...\" Tara said doing her best to lie...she didn't want to have this conversation. Her mother meant well, but sometimes she didn't have the best way of saying things. Sometimes she felt like her mother didn't completely understand her. She knew her mother attempted to, but it never worked out. There was always a barrier between them. A line that separated them. \"Fine? Sweetie, I know that word well. Fine is a word you say when you're not. What's bothering you?\" Tara's mother then plopped herself on the bed next to her daughter and looked at her seriously. Tara could tell there was no halting this conversation. Tara knew for a fact it was unavoidable. \"Well...I just...it's..\" Tara couldn't get the words from her mouth. She felt ridiculous, but hurt at the same time. This time no one interrupted them and it was just Gavin's choice...Gavin rejected her. \"It's just what, Tara? You can tell me anything.\" Tara mom said trying to comfort her daughter, rubbing her shoulder gently. \"Well...Gavin uh, walked me home from school today and when I thought he was um, going to kiss me...he didn't. Now I'm wondering if he even likes me anymore...I don't know...am I thinking too much into this?\" Tara said nervously looking down. Just because Tara bursted out of her shell, didn't mean there was a part of her that wasn't insecure anymore. \"Tara, maybe he was afraid to. I'm sure he cares about you. Sometimes when you're with the one you care about you get nervous.\" Tara took a moment to take in her mothers words. She was correct. She remembered how at Stacy's party Gavin popped up right next to her and they had that talk...She remembered how he looked into her eyes and everything felt like a dream. Like she was floating on a cloud. He got her when no one else did. He took an interest in her. \"Thanks, Mom...you really helped.\" Tara said and then gave her mother a hug. \"You should talk to him, Tara. Just like that time my friend started wearing lavender and it was SO not her color. I think chartreuse goes well for everyone. You should try it, too!\" That was the mother she knew...Tara nodded and then out her mother went. She was a bit crazy, but no matter what, she would always love her mom. Gavin sat in his room sketching out his plans on a piece of paper...it was a great idea, but he had no idea how he would pull it off. Moreno had eyes all over the school...she was probably still bitter. Gavin needed help to set this all up. To get away with it. But the question was, how was that going to be possible? An idea struck him. He knew there would be consequences if he did this, but he had to take a risk. Tara taught him that, that is what life is about. He had to do everything to get to his goal. He then picked up his phone and dialed a number. \"Stacy, I need a favor.\"[Chapter 7] Radio Rebel Perfection Chapter 7: Shoulder The next day came and the rain was pouring outside of the school so everyone was stuck inside. When Gavin walked into the school all he could do was focus on setting his plan in motion. He was too busy to concentrate on the fact that he was nearly drenched in water. Calling Stacy was a daring move on his part, but he felt like it was the only option that was left on the table. Moreno has trust in everything that Stacy speaks. On the phone with Stacy, Gavin could clearly hear the hesitance to assist him just by her voice. She still saw Tara as a threat to her kingdom. She wanted to be the queen bee. Most importantly, she wanted Gavin to be her prince. Not that Radio Babbles prince. Gavin knew she was hesitant, but he wasn't aware of the entire background and extent of it all. To set his plain in the works he was on a mission to find Stacy. He also needed to talk to Gabe. They finally solved their complicated matters and moved their friendship back into the positive direction. Gavin saw Stacy and Kim by Stacy's locker so he decided to approach them. He didn't care if Kim had any insight on the situation considering Stacy and Kim were inseparable. He knew Stacy would spill the details to Stacy eventually. It was only a matter of time. \"Stacy, I need to talk to you discussing the plan.\" Gavin said once he made it over to her. Stacy turned around from her locker with both a look of disgust and irritation painted across her face. She analyzed him standing in front of her and rolled her eyes then flashed a fake smile. \"Gavin, I don't think I'm the right person to help you with this.\" She plainly stated then closed her locker, turning away from him. This angered Gavin and confused him. She was the perfect person, she just didn't want to help. He furrowed his eyebrows. \"What do you mean you're not the right person? Moreno trusts you more than anyone. You even know that.\" Gavin said getting defensive about the entire situation. He needed to do this all right. He couldn't mess it up. \"Well...there is bad blood between Tara and I...you know how it is.\" Stacy said trying to make up a reason at the top of her mind. It was more her against Tara than the other way around. Tara was selfless and could move on, but not Stacy. Stacy was everything that Tara wasn't. Stacy could be cruel and manipulative unlike Tara. Tara had beauty in her soul and would never take advantage of a situation the way Stacy would. Stacy was easy to read for Gavin. Ever since that day she showed her true colors and locked Tara in the closet he could see her for who she was. She was as clear as day. \"What are you talking about?\" Gavin exclaimed in frustration. He knew what game she was playing at. \"Tara gave you that crown at MORP & you're still against her?! You owe her, Stacy. & you know that you do. \" Gavin said seriously looking in her eyes trying to get his point across as efficiently as he could. \"Fine...I'll help...just tell me what you want me to do.\" Stacy said giving into him. She felt guilt and she didn't want to feel that way. \"& after this is done, I better have a clean slate. I shouldn't be having to run around wasting my days helping her.\" Gavin shook his head at her in disapproval. \"You will...\" Gavin said trying to bite his tongue from saying anything rude. Being mean to Stacy wouldn't get him anywhere. She was selfish, but he had to deal with that. \"So, this was the plan. I was hoping you could help me set up -.\" \" I already know that.\" Stacy stated cutting him off. \"Please...\" Gavin said looking at her in desperation. He just wanted to get this over with so he could go meet Tara at her locker. He didn't need to deal with Stacy's attitude. \"I'm sorry...continue.\" Stacy said and crossed her arms across her chest. \"I was hoping you could set up and that Kim could help distract Moreno in case the plan crumbles. Better play it safe than sorry.\" Gavin stated. \"Fine...You know...it's a bummer that we never got our shot..\" Stacy said placing her hand on his shoulder fondly and moved closer to him. Gavin immediately pulled away knowing exactly what she was doing. \"I think differently...\" Gavin said icily looking back at her. He then turned to Kim. \"You're okay with doing that, right?\" Kim then looked at Stacy for her approvement which Stacy gave a little nod. \"Then it's all set.\" On the other side of the building Tara was walking in and she was on a hunt to find Gavin. She realized her silliness from the other day and stopped dwelling on little things. Her nervousness was getting to her. She may have been gaining confidence, but she still had those insecure moments. She was human and she couldn't help it. She was becoming braver, but sometimes things could stump her. She was hoping today she could get the chance to finally get that moment with Gavin. She wasn't worried about it and knew it was going to happen eventually, but she wanted it so badly. As Tara was walking around the corner, she saw something that was very unexpected. She saw Stacy and Gavin talking in what looked like an intense conversation. She was smiling at him and batting her eyes and then she took her hand and placed it on his shoulder fondly. This confused Tara more than anything...She thought that Gavin and her had something special, but what was this she seeing? She looked at it in disbelief. She wasn't really comprehending what was happening. After everything they have went through, why was he flirting with Stacy? All Stacy did was try to destroy Tara's entire life. And she tried to destroy their chance together. Tara knew Gavin didn't like liars so it all wasn't adding up. Why was Gavin even talking to her in the first place? What was there even to discuss? They both had nothing in common. Tara turned around and held back her tears. She put her trust in Gavin and he just broke it. How could he do something like that to her? She needed her best friend. Audrey knew more about this stuff than her... As Tara was walking down the hall she saw Audrey having a conversation with her eccentric friends Larry and Barry. They were going on about something as they always do when they're together. Talking over one another about some sort of nonsense, but that's why Tara loved her group of friends. They could just be themselves around each other and never had to worry about what the other one thought. She walked over to Audrey and tried to contain herself. Something was wrong, but she didn't want to make it a big deal in front of Larry and Barry. She was afraid that if one of them knew, they'd eventually spill. Not on purpose, just because they couldn't stop talking and their filter was completely gone. \"You guys...do you mind if I steal Audrey for a second?\" Tara said quickly, pulling her friend away before Larry and Barry got a chance to respond. \"Where are you taking me, Tara?\" Audrey said stumbling along as Tara pulled her into the janitors closet. She closed the door and pulled on the light then immediately hugged her. This took Audrey by surprise, but she hugged back and she could feel her shirt becoming wet with tears. She hugged back her best friend tightly without hesitation. \"Tara, what's wrong?\" Audrey said. She could tell that her best friend was in some kind of emotional distress. \"Guess what I saw.\" \"What?\" \"Stacy and Gavin...she was all over him...\" Tara said pulling away from her friend. Her face was stained with tears. When Audrey heard this panic rushed over her. She knew why Gavin and Stacy were talking. Gavin needed to be more careful with how he executed the plan. \"Tara, I'm sure it was nothing. Gavin really likes you. He wouldn't mistreat you like that. You know that's not the guy he is. It was probably all Stacy. I'm sure everythings fine. Just don't jump to conclusions.\" \"You're right...\" Tara agreed and started wiping away her tears. \"We should probably get to class.\" \"Why don't you go ahead, Tara? I have to get something in my locker. \" Audrey said and opened the door to the closet. She hated lying to Tara, but she had to set things straight with Gavin. He was being careless with this entire and he needed to be more careful. She didn't like the idea that he contacted Stacy for a hand in the first place, but he did have a point. This was the only way to give Tara that perfect moment. AUTHORS NOTE: I apologize for the late chapter! I just got out of school on the 20th and I'm trying to catch up with all my fanfictions. I promise to have them done by the time I go back to school in the fall. I've been seriously slacking and I honestly regret it![Chapter 8] Radio Rebel Perfection Chapter 8: New Complication Stacy and Gavin finished their conversation. He felt gross after having to deal with her. When she placed her hand on his shoulder it was unbearable. He had no attraction to Stacy. Yeah, she was pretty, but on the inside she was not his type at all. The only reason why he pursued Stacy was because Gabe pressured him into it. Gabe thought it would look good for the bands image and since he trusted Gabe, he went for it. But when he tried, it didn't feel right. His heart belonged to Tara. She had more of a soul to her. A personality. She was someone that Gavin could be real with. She appreciated his thoughts and opinions and vise versa. With them, it was more than just a physical attraction. Gavin stopped trying to pursue Stacy once he got to know Tara. There was an undeniable connection. He couldn't fake like he liked someone. It wouldn't have been fair to Stacy or himself. He wasn't going to do what Gabe wanted if it didn't feel right. Being in a relationship with a girl like Stacy would never feel right to him. Being in a relationship with Tara would always feel right. Since Gavin and Gabe finally worked things out, he was currently searching for him down the hallways. Most of the kids have headed towards their classrooms, but he knew Gabe wouldn't. Gabe had that rockstar rebellious attitude. He thought you should be late to anything you could. Gavin and Gabe were exact opposites, but thats what made their friendship great. They could learn more about each others perspectives, but sometimes, Gabe didn't wanna hear Gavin's. Gabe could be very narrow-minded, but over the past few days that's been evolving. Gavin walked over to Gabe who was hanging out by his locker. He placed his hands in his pockets. \"Can I talk to you about something, man?\" Gavin said and Gabe turned his attention from his locker to his friend. \"What about?\" Gabe looked at his friend curiously. \"Well, it's about Tara.\" \"Oh, that chick you're dating. What about it?\" Gabe said shutting his locker and leaning up against it. \"Well, this may sound weird to you, but I am planning a date with Tara...and I need your help.\" \"That's the eye of the tiger I was talking about. What do you need me to do?\" \"Well, I was hoping that you could help me set up some things. Stacy and Kim are helping me as well. I was planning to have it on the schools performing arts center. I was originally supposed to kiss Tara there, but Stacy interrupted us.\" Gavin said and awkwardly scratched his head. Gabe wasn't really the sappy sort of guy so he wasn't sure if Gabe would understand the entire situation. \"Right, the drama geek class...I'll help you.\" Gabe stated then the corner of his eye saw Audrey storming towards both of them. \"Uh, oh...looks like someone is in trouble.\" Gavin then looked at Gabe with confusion written across his face. \"YOU!\" Audrey said and he could hear the clicking of her heels approaching them. Gavin couldn't help but to sigh and put his head down in annoyance. \"That doesn't sound good...I think it's time for me to go to class.\" Gabe then walked off and Gavin was left standing there. Gavin turned around slowly to face Audrey and regretted every second of being stuck there. He should have just texted Gabe...It would've been easier for him. \"You know, I do have a name.\" Gavin stated in annoyance. Gavin liked Audrey and got that she was just trying to be that friend who wanted the best for their friend, but he felt like this was way too much. \"Is that name stupid? What were you thinking earlier?\" Audrey snapped in response and they were finally face to face. Gavin just looked at her and the confusion kept piling up. What was she going on about? Audrey read the expression on his face. \"Tara saw you talking to Stacy. She came to me and said it looked like she was all over you. I told her it was nothing which I assume it was. You need to watch your footsteps when taking action in this plan. She was crying.\" Gavin's heart immediately sank. He would never purposely hurt Tara like that. He felt like an idiot. The fact that he made her feel that way was something he'd always regret. \"You're right, it was nothing. I was just talking to Stacy about the plan and she tried flirting with me. I didn't let her, though. I don't feel that way about her. I only feel that way about Tara.\" Gavin stated with honesty in his eyes. \"I'll do anything to make sure it doesn't happen again. I promise. I need to talk to Tara...but I don't really know what to say about the situation. I can't lie to her to keep the secret safe.\" Gavin said worried. He wanted to tell Tara everything, but then it would ruin the moment and everything. He wanted to romance her. \"Well, figure a way to make it up to her without talking to her...\" \"Good idea...I really hope she doesn't read into what happened.\" Gavin worriedly rubbed his forehead. He knew he messed up. He should have been more careful. Audrey was one hundred percent accurate on that part. He felt like everything was crushing him down. It was all just too stressful. Seemed like every move he made, there was an error. \"I told her not to worry about it, but I'm really not sure what's running through her head...I think the fact that you rejected her kiss the other day didn't help...and now this...\" \"I know, I know. It looks horrible. I'm not that type of guy, though...I wanted to kiss her the other day, but I remember what you said..\" \"And it was good you rejected her kiss the other day. It will be more worth it when that moment comes...She will appreciate it.\" \"I hope so...I'll talk to you later. First I need to figure out how I can handle this...\" Gavin then turned and started walking off to his class. He had a lot to do. The fact that he had to school work and his band added onto it didn't help. He needed a new plan for a new complication.[Chapter 9] Perfection Radio Rebel Chapter 9: Rose After class Tara headed to her locker to get her lunch. Her mind kept thinking and thinking and thinking the entire class. Her thoughts just kept running around in circles. She found it weird. All the signs were just weird. He rejected her kiss and now he was talking to Stacy...What was going on with him? Did she just make up MORP in her head? She crushed on him since the first Harry Potter movie and discovering that he had mutual feelings just made everything better. She was no longer unnoticed and she loved that fact. They bonded and now she felt like those bonds were being ripped apart and nothing could hold it together. And Stacy...Stacy was the queen of the school and tormented her over the years...She wasn't surprised she would pull a move like that on Gavin. She just wondered if Gavin fell for it. Tara made it to her locker and taped to it was a plastic rose with a note. She took the note delicately in her hands and opened it reading the lines. The note said: \"Dear Tara, Just wanted to remind you that I love you a lot and I can't wait for our date. I will love you until the day this rose dies. - Love, Gavin\" Tara smiled at the note and placed it in her pocket. He did care. Nothing changed. It was all in her head. Her eyes played a game of trickery on her brain. She automatically assumed the worst of the situation. She let her feelings get in the way of her reasoning. Whatever Stacy was doing in that hallway with Gavin could not and would never ruin her relationship with Gavin. She was silly for thinking that. She knew it, too. Fear got the best of her. Her past got the best of her. When she was younger she thought no guy would look at her in the way they looked at all the other girls. She was awkward and shy. There were few people in the world she could actually have a conversation with. Seeing Stacy flirt with Gavin put that fear back into her. She didn't want her past to come back. She wanted to stay the confident new young lady she has became. She worked so hard to get to where she was and she wasn't letting it slip through the cracks. She helped people find their voices and she sure won't let her voice be silenced by her old self. Yes, she was still the same Tara to some degrees, but now she could express herself more. She didn't have to hide. The message Gavin sent to her was sweet. It filled her heart with this sense of joy. Her life wasn't a fairy tale, but she was sure he would be her prince. Or knight in shining armor. He saved her. If it wasn't for his help, she would still be that silent girl. He saved that girl who was screaming inside to be released. He saved that girl who had opinions, interests and a million different thoughts. Tara opened her locker, grabbed her lunch box and headed towards the indoor cafeteria. She hated the fact that they were inside because of the rain, but at least it would be easier to find Gavin this way. The school was pretty big in size as a whole, but the rain kept everyone in close proximity. Tara headed towards the Lincoln Bay Cafeteria and saw Audrey, Larry and Barry at their usual spot. She then headed over to sit with them. Her friends were her comfort. They made her feel at home and constantly welcome. \"Hey, guys. What's up?\" Tara said sitting down next to Audrey. After those words were sent Larry and Barry started babbling right away. They had so many words to say. They were so talkative. Tara had no idea how they could do it so long without needing to catch their breath. Tara then started to drown out the conversation and scanned the lunch room trying to find Gavin. She then spotted him getting out of the cafeteria line and their eyes immediately went to each other. Tara waved over telling him to come over and sit with them, but he just walked the other way and acted like he didn't see her. Tara watched him leave the cafeteria and a look of puzzlement came across her face. Why would he do such a sweet gesture and then blow her off like that? Was this some sort of game? Tara then looked over at Larry and Barry who were too engrossed in their conversation to pay attention to anything else. Tara saw this as the perfect opportunity to talk to Audey. \"Audrey...can I ask you something?\" \"Of course, Tara.\" Audrey then turned her attention to her friend and gave a very interested and concerned look. \"Gavin's being weird..\" Tara said placing one hand on her neck rubbing it. Why are boys so complex? She thought girls were supposed to be the challenging ones to understand in a relationship. \"What do you mean by 'weird'?\" Audrey raised her eyebrows. \"Well, about ten minutes ago I went to my locker and found this sweet note and a plastic rose from him. But when I just tried to wave him over to come and sit with us, he completely avoided me. He's giving me the weirdest signals. I don't get it. He's been acting very strange and unlike himself. First he rejects my kiss, then he talks to Stacy and she's of course all over him and now he's avoiding me. Half of me wants to confront him and ask what is going on, but the other half is afraid of the answer.\" Tara said nervously. She was sorting out all the pieces in her head again. The words fell off her tongue and she didn't want to believe them. As she said them, she tried to piece it all together, but she couldn't. Gavin was becoming a mystery to her recently. She felt like she was losing him before it even started. \"Wow, that's a lot. Tara, are you sure he was purposely avoiding you just now? He could have been looking at something else and you just happened to be in the direction of it. Stop reading into things. You're clearly worried. I can see it all over you. You have nothing to worry about. Gavin wouldn't ice you out like that. And if there is something going on, I'm sure it's nothing that will hurt his relationship with you.\" Audrey said trying to cheer up her friend. Tara didn't know what to think anymore. Part of her wanted to believe Audrey, but the other part of her kept second guessing. Her mind kept wandering to the worst possible situations and possibilities. She needed answers. On the other side of the cafeteria Stacy and Kim were eating with their usual group. Stacy was tapping her finger nails against the schools tables making sure everyone was aware of how irritated she was. She wanted Tara to fail. Even after everything. She may have gotten her crown, but she still wouldn't let Tara turn these people against her. Things between Tara and Stacy weren't over yet. The war was still going on whether that Radio Drivel was aware of it or not. \"Stacy, are you alright?\" Kim stated trying to grab her friends focus. Stacy had a scheming look plastered all over her face. She wanted Gavin and was ready to fight that girl to get him. Tara had no idea who she was dealing with. What Tara had to deal with over the past few days was only a taste as to how bad it could get for her. She wanted to bring Tara down whatever the cost was. \"Perfect...I have an idea.\" Stacy said with an evil grin on her face. She had all the cards in her hands. She was more prepared than anyone could be. \"I'm gonna get Gavin. He was supposed to be mine from the beginning. She's not gonna take him. And you're gonna help me.\" Kim then flashed Stacy a look of terror and her eyes said everything. Kim was the one getting her hands dirty the most out of the two of them. She was always the bait. \"W-what do you mean?\" Kim stammered. She was Stacy's servant and she knew it. Nothing Kim could ever say could change Stacy's mind. She was stuck. Whatever Stacy had planned, it was bad.[Chapter 10] Perfection Radio Rebel Chapter 10: Getting Ready It was Friday night and Stacy and Kim were at Stacy's house hanging out. Kim and Stacy were sitting on her bed together painting their nails and talking about the latest trends. Stacy needed to go over the details on how to win Gavin. She devised this entire plan and there was no possible flaws in it. It would all go over smoothly. That Radio Babble could keep trying, but she wasn't going to end up top dog. Top dog was her spot, not Tara's. Tara was forever supposed to be below her. This was her senior year and Tara wasn't going to steal that as well. \"So, we need to talk about the plan.\" Stacy said adding on another layer of nail polish to her fingers. She needed them to be perfect. Glammed up. She felt like she was irresistible. She felt like the star of the show which was called life. Kim looked at her immediately. Stacy scared Kim, but they were friends so she had to remain loyal. \"What about it?\" Kim asked observing Stacy who was in her own little world. Kim may not have been the sharpest tool in the shed, but she knew nothing could tear Gavin away from Tara. She had to go along with Stacy, though. Whatever Kim said, Stacy wouldn't consider any of the weight to it. Stacy just always disregarded Kim's words. Kim knew how Stacy looked at her, but she couldn't change it. \"So, I was thinking...You know how Gavin told you to distract Moreno? You're gonna tell Moreno what's going on instead. She usually is there on Saturdays doing paperwork in her office. When we get there and when Gavin tells you to go distract Moreno, that's when you tell her. She trusts me. SInce you're close to me, she has to trust you too.\" Stacy simply said. \"Then, I will tell Gabe to go get something and that will get rid of him. Audrey shouldn't be there until later with Tara so we should be fine.\" Kim heard all these words and was processing it all. Stacy had a scheming mind and an angle on everything. She was going to destroy as much as she could. \"What are you gonna do when you get Gavin alone?\" Kim looked at her friend with curiosity. Kim didn't know how Stacy could treat people how she did with no regrets at the end of the day. She seemed to lack any kind of moral. She created this whole entire life in her head and was completely prepared to break people just to make it happen. \"Well, since Moreno has cameras all over the building, look at the screens and text me whenever you see that red headed freak. When you do, I'll kiss Gavin when she arrives and then she will think he's cheating on her and the relationship will be ruined. It's actually quite perfect of a plan.\" Stacy smiled proud of herself for creating it all. All the pieces that held their relationship together were about to shatter. She was willing to break Tara's heart just to get what she thought she deserved. The next day Tara was laying in her bed thinking about Gavin. She thought it was a good sign that he didn't cancel the date and things were starting to move back into the right direction. Things were getting confusing between them so she hoped that this date would help bring them back together and land them safely on the ground. She needed clarity. She wanted to be sure that everything would be alright. To be sure that this relationship isn't being pulled back by the demons in life. Tara looked beside her and saw that the clock read 11AM. Gavin said he would text her around 2PM telling her where they would meet. Before she was able to even get out of her bed, she heard a knock on her door. She sighed. She just wanted some peace and quiet until it was time to go. She may have been there physically, but her mind was somewhere else. \"Come in.\" Tara said grudgingly. She was not in the mood for conversation. Right now she was filled with nervousness and the feeling of butterflies in her stomach was overwhelming her. She needed to of a sudden she saw blonde hair and her mothers face pop in the door. \"Hey, sweetie. Audrey's here.\" Her mother said in a relaxed tone and opened the door wide enough to expose Audrey. Audrey was a perfectionist and a fashionista. Knowing her best friend, she knew she would go all out trying to help Tara get ready for later. Tara pulled the blankets up from on top of her and then Audrey came bouncing in. She closed the door after her mother left so they could talk privately. But knowing her mother, she knew she was probably eavesdropping. \"I'm guessing you're here to help me get ready for my date later?\" Tara asked sitting up looking at her friend. Her hands placed on the edge of the bed. \"I knew I picked a smart best friend. By the way, Gavin told me to bring you to where the date is going to be instead. He really wants to surprise you. He said he should be done in a bit. When he texts you to come, that's when we'll go. \" Audrey said and started ripping through Tara's closet immediately. \"what do we have, what do we have...\" Now Tara was thinking about Gavin even more. Not only because the gesture was sweet, but because she wanted to get this picking out her outfit thing over with... Back at the school Gavin, Stacy, Kim and Gabe were all getting ready. Gavin was nervously worrying making sure everything was perfectly placed on the stage. Beads of sweat started dripping down his forehead. He got nervous before a show before, but this was something entirely different. This was a girl he really liked. Messing up a show, he could get over it and improve in the future, but messing things up with the girl he liked, would break him. Audrey sent fear into him. She put this immense amount of pressure on him which was making him go crazy. Gavin then saw Kim and decided they should get the distraction over with before Moreno comes and catches them. This had to work perfectly. If there was one error, it would be game over. \"Kim..\" Gavin said and started walking towards Kim. \"Do you think you can go distract Moreno now?\" Gavin looked at her with eyes begging for help. Kim looked at Stacy and she gave her a nod saying that this was the moment. \"Of course, Gavin..\" Kim said and quickly turned away from him and walked down the long hall. She didn't want to look suspicious even though every part of her body was trembling with fear. Principal Moreno was an intimidating person to deal with even though Stacy said the cards were in her hands. Gavin was too busy in his own head and his own problems to notice the obvious weird behavior Kim was portraying to everyone. Gavin then took out his phone and sent a text to Tara saying: \"Ready when you are. Can't wait to see you. Love, Gavin.\" A/N Fair warning, be prepared for the next few chapters. (;[Chapter 11] Perfection Radio Rebel Climbing Into Trouble Kim walked down the hallway and finally approached the main office. Just behind the entrance was a door that lead to Moreno's office. Her hands were getting sweaty and were shaking. If she did this, there was no going back. She felt bad for hurting Tara and Gavin, but if she hurt Stacy, Stacy would make every second of her life absolutely miserable and she would not hear the end of it. She already got criticized enough by Stacy as it was and she didn't need more of it piling onto her back. Stacy said that they were friends, but Kim never really felt like they were. She was just hoping that, that would someday change. That's why she always did whatever Stacy wanted. All Kim was looking for was her acceptance. Kim entered the main office and walked up to the door behind the counter. She knocked on it until she heard a voice from behind it telling her to enter. She slowly opened the door and felt like she was entering the lions den and Moreno would pounce on her any second. Moreno was intimidating. She was authority and wasn't one to be messed with. She had power that Kim did not posses. \"Hi, Principal Moreno.\" Kim said softly and walked inside. Principal Moreno looked up from her desk filled with paperwork at the brown haired girl who was standing in front of her. She took off her glasses and studied the teenager. Kim squirmed under the stare that Moreno was giving her. She felt more than uncomfortable in that moment. She felt like the tiniest bug that was just about to get squished. \"Kim, right? What are you doing here on a Saturday afternoon?\" Moreno said and raised her eyebrow. She then started to stand up and ventured over to the front of her desk.. There was something about her that shook Kim. Principal Moreno then leaned up against the desk and kept looking at Kim. Kim tried to think of the right words to say. She was going to expose Tara and Gavin. That's what Stacy wanted. She had to do it. \"Well, there's something important that I have to tell you.\" Kim managed to get out. She could feel her mouth getting dry. She felt like the temperature in the room was rising. \"And what would that be?\" Moreno then crossed her arms and gave Kim a judging look. She was getting frustrated with the girl that was standing in front of her. Kim was interrupting her work that she needed to get done and Kim wouldn't get to the point of her visit fast enough. \"Well, it's about Gavin Morgan and Tara Adams..\" Kim spit out. It was too late to go back in time and change her words now. When Moreno heard Tara's name it immediately grabbed her attention. She knew EXACTLY who Tara Adams was. After what happened at MORP, how could she forget? Tara exposed herself and then somehow got the student body to cover for her. This was a way to bring her down once again. \"Tell me more immediately.\" Principal Moreno barked. Details, details, details. That's exactly what she craved for. That's exactly what she needed. If she had those details, she could serve what she thought was justice. Hearing Moreno bark like that made Kim shake even more. The nervousness just kept building within her body. \"Um, you see, Gavin planned a date with Tara. In the performing arts center. Without permission from you. They trespassed.\" Kim said looking at the ground. Without anymore words from Moreno, she shot past Kim and was on her way to lay down the law. The stage was decorated with multi colored lights hanging down from the ceiling, there was a picnic blanket set up in the center of it, rose petals were leading from the entrance of the performing arts center all the way up to the stage, Red Letter Day and You First were coming out of the speakers because it was something that Tara and Gavin bonded over, sandwiches were placed in the picnic basket because Gavin was the dancing sandwich, lanterns that Gavin was able to snag from MORP were hanging all around and a projection of stars were being displayed on the stages screen. The reason why Gavin decided to add in the stars was because Gavin and Tara were able to have a moment to talk at Stacy's party under them. They were talking about how they were similar in ways. Which was true. They both had an undying appreciation for music and had those times where they lacked confidence and felt unwanted. They were more braver when they had each other to lean on. Gavin was there to remind Tara who she was and Tara was there to make Gavin feel less alone. They both were each other's rocks. They were each other's shoulders. They had a connection that couldn't be denied. There was more to their relationship that what people thought. Gavin was off in his own little world at the moment. He kept checking his phone to see if Audrey and Tara were close yet. Gavin was wearing a blue collared dress shirt with a black tie and black pants. He felt the temperature in the room increase. He hoped Kim had everything under control. He knew that he wasn't the brightest person in the world so that created more worry for him. Things couldn't get screwed up. He knew that Tara was feeling very unloved in the past few days because of his behavior and he couldn't let this fall through the cracks as well. Across the room Gabe was finishing up the last few lights that were supposed to hang from the ceiling. Stacy held the ladder tightly looking up at him. She knew the perfect way to get rid of him. \"We're lucky to have a guy like you helping us, Gabe.\" Stacy said trying to begin a conversation. Boys were easy and flirting was one way to get them to do anything you wanted. \"You know, you're such a good friend for Gavin for doing this. He's lucky to have you.\" Gabe smiled at her comment. He was putty in her hands. She was ready to bend him to get exactly what she wanted out of the situation. Gabe finished up putting up the lights and started going down the ladder. \"Well, what can I say? I'm a solid dude. Gotta have my bandmates back.\" Gabe said as he touched the ground and looked at her. \"We should probably put this away, right? I can imagine it being heavy.\" Stacy said observing the ladder that he just climbed down. \"No, let me do it. I don't want you to hurt yourself. Plus, I wouldn't be a gentleman if I made you.\" Gabe said trying to act charming. \"Are you sure those muscular arms of yours can handle it on their own?\" Stacy said moving closer and placing her hands on one of his arms. He grinned and the flexed them. Gabe loved being the center of attention. That's why he was the head of the band. Guess the whole band thing was making his stock rise more than he thought. \"I can handle it. No big deal.\" Gabe said trying to impress Stacy. He then walked over to the ladder and adjusted it so he would be able to carry it. \"I'll be back in a few. We can continue this conversation when I get back.\" Gabe winked at her and then walked off. Now it was just Gavin and Stacy alone. She was ready to get what was supposed to be hers.[Chapter 12] Radio Rebel Perfection Chapter 12: Seeing Blue Kim was still in Moreno's office and was watching the screens like a hawk. Since it was a Saturday there wasn't that much activity inside and outside of the building going on. Everyone was too busy having a life outside the doors of Lincoln Bay HIgh. Kim wished she was doing something better with her weekend, but she couldn't defy Stacy. Kim had to stay loyal to Stacy no matter the consequences. She felt like a dog that way. She felt like Stacy's pet and not a person who could make up their mind and have opinions. Every decision and opinion Kim ever had was taken away from her once she became friends with Stacy. It was Stacy's way or the highway. Kim had no idea where Moreno was at this point, but she kept looking at the screens for Tara and Audrey. Then she saw them. She saw Audrey leading Tara into the building with a blindfold around her head. Kim knew the plan and she had to work on the other step. Kim felt like she was doing all the dirty work for nothing. But she wanted to maintain her friendship with Stacy. When they were younger, Stacy was different, but when she hit middle school, she just tortured people. Kim took out her phone and then proceeded to send Stacy a text telling her that Tara and Audrey have arrived at the school. Things were gonna get messy. Kim felt this horrible feeling in her stomach and her conscience was telling her not to do it, but she felt like she had to at the same time. Tara and Audrey finally arrived at the school in Audrey's car. Tara was wearing a blue blindfold around her eyes so she wouldn't be able to see where she was. For an outfit, Audrey picked out a black skirt and a black blazer with a gray shirt that said 'Music Is Our Heartbeat' underneath it. Audrey wanted to get crazy with her outfit, but Tara managed to tame the hyena. Gavin liked her for herself and she didn't feel the need to go over the top with it all. She wanted to be comfortable and didn't want to feel out of place with herself because of the outfit. Tara was very hesitant and shy to wearing the blindfold, but Gavin wanted to keep the date a surprise and Audrey intended to make that work. It was Gavin and Tara's second date and it had to count. It had to be special and be made into a memory that neither of them could forget. It had to be something that they could cherish forever. Audrey went to Tara's side of the car and opened the door so she could get out. Tara almost fell because of the shoes she was wearing, but she managed to recover. \"Okay, remember to not do that in front of Gavin.\" Audrey said with a laugh and helped her friend all the way out of the car. \"Think it's a little too late for that. He already saw me slam my head against his desk.\" Tara started laughing and turning a little red from embarrassment. \"And I think he looked at his desk to see if it was alright after..\" This then caused the both of them to laugh even more until their sides hurt. They both had their awkward and embarrassing moments, but they were able to laugh at themselves. Even when things went completely wrong. They didn't take themselves seriously which made things more entertaining for them. It's one of the reasons why they meshed so well together. Audrey led Tara to the front of the building and through the doors. It was a nice sunny day and it was just perfect for everything. Audrey had a feeling that nothing would go wrong for her friend. Things had to work out between her and Gavin. She felt like they were meant to be and the kiss would prove that theory. Tara had no idea what a treat she was in for. Audrey would not let anything spoil her best friends day. She had a feeling that nothing would be able to. Tara was finally going to feel special. Tara was finally going to feel right. Tara and Gavin had a connection that even she could see. Audrey texted Gavin that they were there and everything was about to be set in motion. She couldn't wait to hear all about the details of the date. Audrey lead Tara behind the stage in front of a black door. She then proceeded to take off the blue blindfold. \"You better tell me the details later. He should be behind those doors.\" Audrey then hugged Tara and did their signature handshake and ran off. Tara looked at the door and grinned widely. She could feel the butterflies in her stomach. Gavin was sitting on the edge of the stage waiting for Tara. Stacy eyed her prey and a sense of pride came over her. She was just waiting for the perfect opportunity to pounce and get what she wanted. She was getting her fairytale ending and she wouldn't let anyone stand in her way. She was happy she finally got rid of that Gabe. The fact that he thought he had a chance made her laugh inside. What an ego. He was so oblivious to her true intentions. She could wrap any man around her fingers so easily. Gavin resisted which started to irritate her to the extremes, though. Gavin was more difficult to get at. He was a challenge which intrigued her. All of a sudden she felt her phone vibrate from within her purse and took it out to see a message from Kim. She looked down at the words with satisfaction. Audrey and Tara were walking in the building. This was her moment to change the game. She was going to end up winning the prize. That prize was Gavin. Stacy put on one of her most brightest smiles and sat next to him. Gavin looked over at her bewildered. Then he looked behind him and saw that Gabe was gone. \"Where did Gabe go?\" Gavin looked back at her and asked with concern in his tone. He was still thinking about Tara. \"Oh, he just went to put away the ladder...Nothing to be worried about, Gavin.\" Stacy said charmingly. Gavin then got up from the stage and started looking around making sure it all matched his expectations. He planned it all out in his head and just wanted to stick to the plan. Stacy then got up and walked over to him. \"This looks really nice, Gavin...You put a lot of hard work into it.\" Stacy said trying to loosen him up and lower his guard. \"Thanks.\" Gavin said trying to avoid any conversation with her. He didn't want to mess up things with Tara. He wouldn't let her sneak under his skin. He wanted Gabe to come back as fast as he could. Gavin could see right through Stacy and he knew what she was willing to do. He had to be careful around her. She then walked closer to him and started to touch his arm. Feeling the muscle underneath his clothing. He immediately jolted away from it. Stacy then looked at him shocked. She knew she had to try harder. Gavin then turned towards her and looked at her straight in the eye. \"You need to stop with this. Whatever you are doing, it's not gonna work. I love Tara and I always will love Tara and I'm sick of you thinking you can walk over anyone. I'm sick of you trying to ruin people's lives just to get what you want. .\" Gavin said looking at her intensely. He was angered by her constantly trying to flirt with him and screw things up. He was angered by the fact that she almost screwed up things between Tara and him before it even started. The fact that she was so unappreciative of everything Tara had done for her angered him. The list just went on. He did not trust any part of Stacy. Stacy was processing his Stacy knew Tara would be through the doors any second. She then heard the click of the door opening, Stacy then grabbed Gavin by the collar, pulled him close to her and kissed him. A/N I'm so mean leaving you guys with this cliffhanger. but, oh well. (;[Chapter 13] Perfection Radio Rebel Chapter 13: Alone Tara took a deep breath and pushed onto the door of the stage. She went through all the curtains and then she saw something that made her heart explode with pain. She couldn't believe what her eyes were looking at. She saw Gavin and Stacy kissing. Stacy held onto him tightly and was kissing him with all she had. Tara gasped and immediately turned away. Tears started to stream down her face and there was no stopping it. She knew something with Gavin was off and this was it...He had feelings for Stacy still. She should've confronted him instead of getting played this entire time. She was just strung along and then crushed at the end of it all. Gavin wasn't what she thought he was. He was just as self-centered, egotistical and thoughtless as Gabe. The picture of them kissing just kept running through her brain. She ran her fingers through her hair and made her way down the hall as fast as she could. She needed to get out of there, she needed to get home. She needed someone who would care. She needed her best friend. That's exactly who and what she needed. She needed someone to lean on and make her feel a bit better. She just felt like nothing was going right. She thought things would have changed with her finally bursting out of her shell and showing the world who she truly was. She felt like that girl everyone just discarded and avoided all over again. She felt unwanted and unloved. She was once again misplaced in the world. Gavin heard a gasp come from behind him and he knew exactly where it was coming from. He pulled away as fast as he could from Stacy. She had a tight grip on his shirt so it took some effort, but he had to get her away from him. The feeling of her lips against his made him nauseous. It didn't feel right kissing Stacy. Gavin knew who he loved and it was Tara. It wasn't the girl who kept throwing herself at him. His heart in his chest started pounding faster and faster with fear and worry about what Tara had just seen go down. When he pulled away, she was gone. He knew what it looked like. He knew exactly what it looked like. He would never hurt Tara that way. He didn't have it in him to inflict that kind of hurt on someone. Especially Tara. Tara meant a lot to him. More than words to him and she was the person he cared about most. Gavin glared at Stacy and was ready to yell at her, but he kept it in. He had to locate Tara and explain the entire situation in hopes that she would believe him. He didn't have time to waste his breath on Stacy. Stacy wasn't even worth the thought. Tara was more important to Gavin than Stacy and she always would be. She was a wicked human being and he saw that. Gavin quickly exited the performing arts center and started rushing down the hall after Tara. He could hear her footsteps up ahead. \"Tara, come back!\" He shouted after her. Tara heard his voice echo through the halls and more tears started to fall down her face. How dare he chase after her after what she just witnessed? How dare he try to ask for her forgiveness? Whoever that boy was chasing her, he was not the person she fell for. Tara was filled with anger and sadness. She felt like she was overflowing with it all. \"I need to talk to you!\" He shouted and she could hear his footsteps catching up to hers. She didn't want to see him. She started running faster down the hallway. She took out her phone and started to call Audrey as fast as she could. She knew Audrey couldn't be far away from the school. She probably would still be in the parking lot. She just couldn't deal with Gavin right now. Not even for one moment. She pushed passed the entrance doors of the school and made her way into the front of the building. The ringing finally stopped and Audrey answered. \"Audrey...\" Tara said trying to contain herself, but she couldn't. She started to break down right there. \"I just got to the car. Meet me there.\" Audrey said before Tara could finish herself. She wasn't sure what was wrong with her friend and as far as she knew, she didn't have to until Tara was ready to tell her. She could tell her friend was overwhelmed and she didn't want to make it worse by making her friend think about it more. \"Thank you.\" Tara got out and hung up the phone. Before she could even put the phone back into her purse, she felt someone's hand placed gently on her arm. She looked up and standing right next to her was Gavin. She sighed with annoyance and pulled her arm out of his grip. \"Leave me alone, Gavin.\" She said starting to walk across the street to get to the parking lot. Gavin followed behind. \"Tara, it wasn't what it looked like.\" Gavin said trying to catch up to her speed. \"Looked like you two were cozy to me.\" Tara said walking faster. \"She kissed me. I did not kiss her. I would never betray your trust like that. Tara, you know me. I care about you...Tara, I love you.\" Gavin said still chasing her. Tara wasn't sure to believe that last part or not. \"I'm sick of being fed lies, Gavin. Just leave me alone.\" Tara said icily leaving Gavin in the dust. She finally got to Audrey's car and opened the door to the vehicle. Gavin watched her drive off and felt completely hopeless in that moment. He felt like he totally lost her. He wanted to prove to her that he wasn't lying, but didn't know how to. He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. He knew Audrey knew that Stacy was over him this week, but he wasn't sure if she would believe him if he said that Stacy kissed him and not the other way around. Audrey and he weren't close. They never really talked before and the only reason why they started was because they both were close to Tara. He felt like Audrey could easily think that he was the bad guy who fell into Stacy's trap. He was mentally kicking himself. He should've tried harder to make her listen. Then again, she needed to calm down. He wanted to have a conversation with her not a battle. She was upset and she wouldn't listen to anything he said. Gavin reached into his pants pockets and grabbed his phone then, texted Gabe about everything that happened. He wanted to go home and think about it. He needed to process. Stacy was left standing there completely surprised that there was no response from Gavin after she just tried to take down his relationship. He just ran after Tara without any hesitation. She was standing there looking like a fool. She was looking like an idiot. She was glad no one was around to see it, but she felt like the biggest loser on the face of the Earth. Nothing Stacy did would change his mind. Nothing at all. She kept working and working and none of it paid off. She put in all that effort and didn't get what she wanted in the end. She felt like she deserved Gavin. \"STACY DEBANE!\" She heard a yell from the front of the stage that sounded similar to Moreno's. Another part of her plan was just about to blow up in front of her face. She turned around slowly and flashed Principal Moreno a big smile. She saw Kim trailing behind her catching up with every step. She had to use her words in the most charming way possible. She had to convince her that she was innocent. \"It's nice to see you, Principal Moreno.\" Stacy stated and walked down the stairs of the stage over to the much shorter and older woman. \"What is going on here?! Your friend Kim interrupted my work and said the Adams girl was here, but I don't see her!\" Moreno said shouting at her and placing her hands on her hips in the most judgmental way. \"Principal Moreno, she was here. I saw her, I-.\" Stacy said as politely as possible. She knew things weren't looking good for her. \"Where could she have gone, then? Where is your proof? And what is all of this?!\" She said waving her hands around pointing to the decorations that were spread out across the stage. Principal Moreno was filled with rage. She was a busy woman and was getting quite sick of these teenagers taking advantage of her. This was her school and she was supposed to lead the students, not to be made a joke of by them. \"Well, you see, Principal Moren-\" \"No words, Ms. Debane! You and your friend will have to clean up all of this and serve three days detention for violating school property, lying to authority, and interrupting my work!\" Moreno said and Stacy tried to make an effort to respond, but she immediately was silenced by one of Moreno's glares. Moreno then turned and walked away leaving Stacy and Kim alone in a room together.[Chapter 14] Radio Rebel Perfection Chapter 14: Confessions Kim looked at Stacy who was shooting more nasty looks at her than she could count. Kim did everything Stacy wanted, but things didn't turn out in Stacy's favor. She couldn't read what was going through Stacy's mind, but she knew it wasn't good. Kim tensed up in apprehension. She knew where things were going to go. She knew Stacy was going to lay it into her any second. It wasn't her fault, but she knew Stacy would somehow turn it into that. Stacy crossed her arms across her chest, walked closer to Kim and stared down upon her face. Kim could feel Stacy's shadow over her. She felt smaller as each moment went by. Things in the room felt darker and more intense. \"Do you have anything to say for yourself?\" Stacy asked in a harsh tone. Kim looked at her friend with unease as she processed the words. She thought it was completely uncalled for that Stacy was putting the blame on her. She did what Stacy asked. She didn't disobey the wishes of her friend yet she was being yelled at and judged? Kim didn't know exactly what to say to her. She was stumped for words. \"Well? Are you just gonna stand there thoughtless? Oh, wait. That's all the time, isn't it?\" Stacy said getting into her friends face. Kim tried her best to keep her composure. She didn't want to be weak anymore. Stacy never acted like a friend to her and now because Kim did what Stacy wanted, Kim was the one facing punishment as well. \"Stacy, I tried my best. I did what YOU asked of me. How is this my fault?\" Kim said questioning her friend. She planted her feet firmly on the ground and was finally standing up to her friend. Stacy looked at her friend shocked. How dare she talk to her in that manner? \"Excuse me? What did you say?\" Stacy then moved closer trying to intimidate Kim. Kim became nervous, but tried her best not to show it. Kim matched Stacy's step trying to show Stacy that she wasn't her pet. That she wasn't her servant of any kind. \"I said that it wasn't my fault. & you still haven't answered it.\" Kim said challenging Stacy. Stacy stood there silent for a few moments trying to think of a better comeback, but couldn't match it. \"Well? Are you just gonna stand there thoughtless?\" Kim said burning her with her same exact words. This then caused Stacy's jaw to drop. Even Kim was rebelling against her now! \"Don't you speak to me like that!\" Stacy said with fury growing inside of her as each second passed. Kim was becoming an enemy in that moment. She was losing another person in her army. \"But you can talk to me like that?\" Kim snapped back. \"You never had a problem with it before.\" Stacy said and furrowed her eyebrows. \"Well, now I do. For once Stacy, maybe it's good you get a taste of your own medicine.\" All these words inside of Kim were finally bursting out. She was finally saying how she felt and not letting herself be pushed around. She wasn't going to be a victim anymore. She was going to be strong. She was going to be herself and not silenced by Stacy. Kim then walked away from Stacy and started cleaning. She was planning to set things right with Tara and Gavin after she was done. She felt bad that Stacy ruined something else. She felt bad that Stacy brought hurt among two more people. Audrey was driving the car to her house so Tara wouldn't have to deal with her mother picking her way into her drama. Tara's mom was nosy and they both knew it. Tara wanted help and not gossip. Audrey parked the car and entered the grey house with the cute little garden in the front. They went straight up to Audrey's room that had the walls painted with splatters of pink, blue and green. Audrey immediately turned on her music hoping it would relax Tara a bit. She grabbed a tissue from the tissue box, walked over to Tara who was sitting on her bed and handed it to her. \"Do you want to tell me what happened?\" Audrey said rubbing her friends shoulder. She never saw Tara this hurt before. She didn't know what exactly happened, but she was planning to get to the end of it. All she knew was that if Gavin hurt her, he'd be dead on Monday. Tara took a breath and tried to pull herself together to explain, but it was harder than she thought. She couldn't believe that Gavin of all people would do that. It just made her doubt everything. It was just making her more cautious about everything from now on. \"I...I saw Gavin and Stacy. They were, um, kissing...\" Tara said choking it out through her tears. Her saying it out loud made it all feel more real. Tara immediately placed her hands on her face and started looking down at the ground. She didn't want to see her friend's reaction. She didn't want to face the realities of it all. Audrey heard the words and sighed. \"Tara...\" Audrey started. She didn't know the whole situation. She shouldn't have left Tara alone. She knew Stacy was hitting on Gavin this week and that he rejected it, but she wasn't positive of all the details. \"I'm sorry.\" Audrey said and hugged her best friend tightly. \"There's something I need to tell you about, though.\" Tara then turned her head and took her view from the ground to her friend. \"Audrey, what are you talking about?\" Tara said not sure if she wanted answers. She had to get them, though. Something inside of her wanted an explanation. \"Well, remember when you came to me about how Stacy was all over Gavin earlier this week?\" Tara nodded with understanding...She remembered and she wanted to forget. \"Well, there was something that I didn't tell you about.\" Tara sniffled and wiped her tears with her sleeve. Her best friend was keeping secrets from her? \"The reason why Gavin was talking to Stacy was because he needed her help to set up. He needed someone to get rid of Moreno and Stacy and Kim were his only options. The reason why he went so out of his way with all of this was because he wanted things to move forward between you two. I told him how your first kiss was supposed to be magical and that he shouldn't mess it up. That's also the reason why he rejected yours the other day. He wanted to give you the perfect kiss. When he started talking to Stacy she started flirting with Gavin, but he wanted no part of it. I hope you're not mad at me. I just wanted to help you guys. I just care a lot about you. You're my best friend.\" Audrey waited for her best friends reaction. A small smile crept across Tara's face, but then it turned immediately to a frown.. \"He was telling the truth...and I totally hurt him.\" Tara said and sighed. When did things get all complicated? \"Tara...I'm sure he could see the situation from your perspective.\" Audrey said trying to comfort her friend. Tara looked completely worn out from the entire day. When she woke up, she was excited, but things just kept crushing her down. \"You're probably right...\" Tara then fell back on Audrey's bed and looked up at the ceiling and started wiping away the last few of her tears. All of a sudden her phone started to ring from an unrecognizable number. She hoped it was Gavin on the other end calling from who knows where. She just needed to talk to him about everything. She needed to sort it out and apologize. She picked up the phone and pressed the 'talk' button. \"Hello?\" Tara said unsure of who was on the other end of the phone call. She then heard a voice she never thought would be calling her. It was Kim. Why in the world would she be calling her? She was Stacy's partner in crime. They were a combo deal. \"Tara, I need to talk to you about earlier. Can you tell me where you are so I can meet you?\" Kim said with urgency in her voice. \"Do you know where Audrey's house is?\" Tara responded and Audrey looked at her right when she heard her name. Audrey had no idea who was on the other end. \"Yeah. I'll be right over. Meet me outside.\" \"Sounds good.\" Tara said and then hung up the phone. Tara told Audrey who was on the other end and both of them started racking their brain trying to figure out what she could possibly want from them. Racking their brain trying to figure out what they could possibly say. Ten minutes later they heard a car pull into the driveway and got out of Audrey's room and headed outside. The reason why Audrey came outside with Tara was for moral support. She needed someone at the moment. Today was a rough day for her. Kim got out of the car and walked to the front porch where Tara and Audrey were standing. \"Thanks for letting me meet you guys.\" Kim said as politely as possible. She wanted to be openly honest for once. She wasn't sure where her friendship with Stacy was and to be honest, she didn't really care anymore. She was tired of being used and taken for granted. \"You're welcome, I guess...\" Tara said and sat down on Audrey's porch swing. Audrey then followed and sat next to her and Kim sat on the bench across from them. \"What did you want to talk about?\" Tara finally got the voice in her to ask. She hoped curiosity wouldn't kill the cat. \"I heard about what happened with you and Gavin earlier today and I have a confession. This is hard for me to say, but this entire week Stacy has been trying to steal him from you. Stacy kissed Gavin earlier. It wasn't the other way around. Stacy wanted to get Gavin alone and she got that chance...right when you walked in. She's not all to blame...I helped her. I feel horrible about it. It's just, my entire life Stacy and I have been friends. I guess I hoped someday her old self would come back and I wouldn't need to work for her approval anymore. Gavin loves you, Tara. And I think you should be with him. I'm also really sorry for my part in it all.\" Tara listened to Kim's confession and smiled at the end of it. She was upset that Kim did that, but she wasn't angry with her. She understood. \"Thank you for coming to me and telling me this. Audrey told me some of the details as to what happened and it's really reassuring finding out more. I also accept your apology. I'm sorry that you had to go through all that with Stacy as well. No one should be treated like that, Kim.\" Tara said looking at Kim the entire time. She felt sympathy for her. \"You're welcome..\" Kim said getting up. \"I hope things work really are nice, Tara.\" With that, Kim left the premises and drove off. Tara needed to talk to Gavin Monday and that was what she was planning to do. They needed to get past this all. The perfect kiss...didn't Gavin know that the kiss wasn't that important to her? All she cared about was their connection.[Chapter 15] Radio Rebel Perfection Chapter 15: Monday Gavin sat in his room Sunday night and was trying to figure out the perfect way he was supposed to explain everything to Tara. He wanted to be honest with her. He always wanted to be honest with her. There was nothing for him to hide, anyways. He wanted to gain her trust again. He wanted to show her who he really was again. Her image of him at the moment was distorted. She was just basing her opinion on a misconception. Gavin had to find the perfect time to talk to her. He wanted to meet her at her locker first thing in the morning. All he could focus on was explaining it all. He had to let her know how he felt. Stacy screwed that up for him Saturday, but he wouldn't let it ruin their future. He wanted to move their relationship forward and not let the pieces of what could be shatter before they were even made. All he knew was that he needed to be openly honest. He hoped Tara finally cooled a bit off. Last time they talked, she was a mix of so much emotions. He knew it wasn't his fault, but he knew exactly what it looked like as well. He realized that Tara was strong, but she also was fragile. Tara was human and had emotions and he respected that. He respected everything that she was. All he wanted to was apologize and try to repair things the best to his ability. He wanted to start over. Tara was in her room Sunday night and was thinking about Gavin. She was thinking about how they needed to talk. She should've listened Saturday, but she was just so overwhelmed it was blocking her reasoning. Knowing what she knew now, she wish she could back and just change everything. She wished she could go back and tell him that she just enjoyed being in the presence of him. She knew Audrey had good intentions, but they really weren't necessary. Audrey got Gavin all worked up over nothing. If she had known, she would've stopped it. She was going to talk to him tomorrow. Nothing was going to stop her. As for Stacy, she just chose to avoid her at all costs. Hopefully her and Kim's fight taught her a lesson. Tara was just grateful about the fact that in a month high school would be officially over for her. She could deal with Stacy for one more month. Tara sighed thinking about it all and then decided to head off to bed. Tomorrow was going to be a lot for her. It was Monday morning and Gavin Morgan was once again on another mission. He intended to do what he had planned last night and discuss the entire situation with Tara. The morning was off to a dreary start and Gavin was quite concerned whether or not Tara would take the time to listen to him. When he approached her locker earlier that morning, she was not there to his dismay. He then decided to go to class before he would've had to face disciplinary actions. The bell rang dismissing him from his third class and he entered back into the halls of the school. It was time for lunch and everyone was heading outside or towards the indoor cafeteria. He hoped Tara would be somewhere to be found. He walked past the performing arts center and he just imagined Tara running through the halls away from him all over again. He wish he could've just got the opportunity to explain. As he was walking down the hall, he felt someone tug on the sleeve of right arm and he got pulled inside a dark room that was the janitors closet. He then readjusted himself so he could see the person who was standing before him and it was the girl he was looking for. \"Tara, I need to talk to you.\" Gavin said looking in her brown eyes. It was hard to see all her features, but he wanted to get the message through. He had a lot to say and he planned on saying it. He had to state everything as fast as he could before she got fed up with him and time ran out. \"You see, on saturday-\" All of a sudden the feeling of her lips on his cut him off as she slinked her arms around his neck. Gavin wasn't sure how to respond. He had this entire date set up and that got ruined and now the kiss could have just been ruined. He enjoyed the kiss, but he became worried wondering if it was everything she wanted. She then pulled away after a few seconds and looked at him. He looked at her with a goofy grin on his face with a mix of shock and relief. He guessed from the kiss that she was no longer mad at him which took the pressure off of him. \"I know what happened. Audrey and Kim told me all of the details.\" Tara said and placed her hand on his cheek looking up at him. He nodded in comprehension. \"I'm sorry for being angry with you. It's just-\" \"Please, don't be sorry. Anyone who saw what you did would've had the same reaction. I'm sorry for being all distant. It's just, I knew if I talked to you, I wouldn't be able to lie to you. Avoiding you seemed like the only option.\" Gavin said trying to explain himself. He felt bad for hurting her that way. He knew he looked guilty at that moment when Tara saw Gavin and Stacy. \"Gavin, I get it. Just don't listen to my crazy friends ever again.\" Tara said laughing and Gavin started as well. Tara then moved her arm back around his neck. He then placed his arms around her waist. Tara and Gavin's eyes met and it seemed like everything fit. Like this was where they were meant to be. Tara felt safe with Gavin's arms around her. \"Every kiss with you would be perfect because you're the one I'm with.\" Tara said looking at him seriously. As each word fell off her tongue, she meant it. \"You don't need to do any grand gestures. The fact that we're together is all that matters to me. I would've been perfectly fine with pizza and a movie. Being together is what makes those moments fun and worth it. I care about you more than a kiss.\" Gavin nodded and moved closer to her. \"I really do love you, Tara. You mean the world to me. I love everything about you. Being with you just completes me. Your heart is beautiful and so is your personality. You're the person I can tell anything to.\" Gavin said and Tara could hear the sincerity in his voice and see it in his eyes. \"I love you too, Gavin.\" Tara released the words from her tongue and it felt like the most honest and truthful thing she had ever said in her entire life. They both couldn't stop smiling at each other. \"So...was that 'the perfect kiss'?\" Gavin said with a little chuckle. Tara then gave him a flirtatious look. \"I don't know, you might wanna try it again.\" Tara then bit on her bottom lip and leaned closer to Gavin. Gavin understood the message that was displayed so clearly and leaned in and kissed her again. When their lips touched again, they could feel electricity and sparks and everything. They felt like their souls were combining together and becoming into one. Gavin then poked his tongue out and asked for entrance into her mouth. She felt his tongue against her soft lips and opened up it slowly and they kissed with more passionately. Their tongues became entangled like the cords of a tangled set of headphones. Tara moved backwards until she hit the wall and Gavin matched her footsteps. She then took her hands and started running them through his curly black hair. All of a sudden they heard the opening of the door and a light switch turn on and immediately pulled away. They looked at where the light was coming from and felt a mix of both awkwardness and terror. They turned red in the face and saw that the school janitor, Mr. McGowski of Lincoln Bay High standing there. Tara and Gavin looked at each other in shock then looked back at him. \"Bad time?\" Mr. McGowski said laughing. Tara and Gavin had no words to say. They had no explanation. Their brains were stumped. Their mouth could not produce any words at all. Mr. McGowski then grabbed the broom and dustpan then closed the door to the closet leaving Tara and Gavin inside. They watched the door for a few seconds after he left in utter amazement and embarrassment. Gavin then looked at Tara and flashed a smile. \"Well, it was the perfect kiss up until that moment.\" Gavin stated and this both caused them to laugh. They both leaned in and proceeded kissing once again and enjoying every moment of being together. A/N THE END! Hope you guys liked the story. Please tell me if you did in the review section!

Chapter 1- Two Equals One Gwen POV I counted down, 3, 2, 1. I clicked on the voice modulator, and Tara said, \"This is Radio Rebel, live from underground. You don't know who I am, but I know who you are because I am one of you.\" \"Report cards came out today; we got minus' in participation. You can't give us a minus for who we are. So since grades are being handed out, I think I'll give all of us at Linkin Bay High an F. For labeling each other; Jocks, outcasts, dorks, queen bees and their fellow pops, and the newborn pops,\" Tara said and I smiled at the thought of the newborn pops. Tara smiled giggling at me, and I shrugged smiling at her. \"Guys these are labels, not who we really are. Once upon a time, being different was a good thing, now those differences just divide us. You deserve to embrace your awesomeness; stand up for who you are, and reject the status quo.\" Tara said, \"I dare you.\" Let me back up, my name is Gwen Adams. I'm the fraternal twin sister of Tara Adams, who is also one of my best friends. I have a boyfriend, his name's Gabe. He's in a band called the GGGG's. We've been dating for 2 years. Tara and I do the Radio Rebel show together, as I was always doing everything with her. I didn't say anything, but I did the music, and voice modulator; all that fun stuff. It's also slowly pulling Tara from her shell which is always a plus. \"Okay, last night, Radio Rebel,\" Audrey said, and Tara said, \"Was awesome.\" \"As usual, reject the status quo is my new life motto. She's so… inspiring, so herself.\" Audrey said. \"I wish I could be more like her,\" Tara said, and I shut my locker slinging my backpack over my shoulder. \"You should talk to your step-dad,\" Audrey said. \"What? Why?\" I asked. \"Uh, he runs Slam-FM the biggest radio station in Seattle. Maybe he could give you two internships. That'd give you a confidence booster right?\" Audrey said. \"Are you kidding me? He's been married to our mom for what, 2 months, probably thinks I'm a total step freak. I freak out when he asks what type of cereal I want.\" Tara said, and I patted her on the shoulder, and she smiled at me. \"I just wish I could talk to everyone the way I talk to you two. Guess that's why you two are my BFF's.\" Tara said as we started walking, and I smiled. \"BFFTLEWE,\" Audrey said, and Tara and I looked at her in confusion. \"Best Friends For Totally Like Ever Without Exception,\" Audrey said smiling. \"Catchy,\" I said sarcasm lacing my voice. \"You need a relaxation technic, when I'm memorizing lines for drama I imagine I'm breathing in the words.\" \"Audrey, what does that even mean?\" I asked. She cleared her throat, took a deep breath and said breathing out, \"You need to breathe,\" She took another breath, \"Your words.\" \"How can you even breathe at a time like this?\" Barry said coming around the corner, and pushed us forward. \"Problem Barry?\" Tara asked. \"Last night Radio Rebel gave the biggest clue yet about her identity. She goes to our school.\" Barry said walking backwards. \"She mentioned it at 14:30 at Tuesday night's podcast.\" Larry said, and we went into the elevator. \"Wow, obsessed much Larry?\" Audrey asked. \"Obsessed? Please! I would hardly describe myself as obsessive.\" Larry said, and pulled out a wipey, and wiped off the elevator button, and then punched it. We gave him weird looks. \"What? It's flu season!\" Larry said. I nodded, and smiled a small smile at him a little creeped out. We walked out of the elevator, and Larry said, \"It's so exciting, someone on the radio who's actually one of us!\" \"It could be her… or her… or her… or her,\" Barry said, and I rolled my eyes. \"No that girl's too tall. Radio Rebel's voice sound… 5'6 to me like Gwen, and her hair color is red. Kind of like Tara's.\" Larry said. \"What?\" Audrey said, and Barry said, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, they are nothing like Tara and Gwen. Well maybe Gwen.\" \"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?\" Tara asked. \"Oh, we love you, but you are nothing like Radio Rebel who is definitely a blonde,\" Barry said. \"And how do you know this?\" I asked. \"Because she is my soul-mate. For example I also got a minus in participation.\" Barry said, and I laughed as Larry said, \"How can it be that you never shut up?\" \"Exactly,\" Barry said, and I rolled my eyes and watched as Stacy kicked a kid's toy car out of the way. She was going on about Prom dates. \"How do we reject the status quo, when the status quo is so… status quo,\" Tara asked. \"Like Radio Rebel says, be ourselves,\" Audrey said, and started walking over to Stacy. Tara and I shared a look, and ran off after her. \"Hi, Stacy. How's it going?\" Audrey said to Stacy. Oh God this isn't gonna turn out good. \"This is what I was talking about, everyone thinks they can talk to us because of the internally lame, Radio babble.\" Stacy said. \"We think she protests too much,\" Barry said. \"Yeah, we thinks… wait, what do we thinks?\" Larry asked Barry. I rolled my eyes. \"That maybe she's Radio Rebel,\" Barry said pointing to Stacy. \"Please, like I would ever encourage people like you, to talk to us,\" Stacy said snottily. \"Ah ha, so you listen to her!\" Larry said pointing a finger. \"This one's staring at me. Make it stop.\" Kim said to Stacy while looking at Barry scared and nervous. \"Please, don't stand so close to us,\" Stacy said. \"You and I aren't any different, like Radio Rebel sai-\" \"-No words. You don't think we're different, watch and learn. Principal Moreno!\" Stacy said, and Moreno said, \"Stacy! Everything alright over here?\" \"Actually no. Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some podcast in class. Of course I said no,\" Stacy said. That bitch. \"What? No! I never-\" \"You know there is an anti-distraction policy, let me see your bag.\" Moreno said. \"But I wasn't even listening to it,\" Audrey said handing it over. \"Well now you can't, you too, young lady,\" Moreno said, and Tara handed her's over. Moreno and Stacy liked me for some weird reason. I don't even know. \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention Stacy,\" Moreno said, and walked away. \"Get it now, your little DJ hero doesn't know what she's talking about,\" Stacy said. Tara looked like she wanted to say something, but it wouldn't come out. \"Oh, does her royal shyness want to say something?\" Stacy said, and Tara attempted to say something, but couldn't. \"Back off Stacy,\" I said bringing attention to myself. \"Why are you standing up for her much less hanging around them!? You're much better than that, Gwen,\" Stacy said, patted my shoulder, and left. Weird… As we headed off to class, my hand was suddenly pulled, and I was pulled into Gabe's chest. \"Hi,\" Gabe said, and leaned down and kissed me. I smiled and wrapped my arm around his waist, and Gavin stood by us smiling at us. \"Hey Gavin,\" I said and smiled at him. \"Hey Gwen,\" Gavin said smiling back at me. Gavin was like my brother. We were just that close. Gabe sometimes even got jealous from it. It was quite amusing. \"Watch this,\" Gabe said, and I stood by Gavin as Gabe got into position, and I crossed my arms. Gavin pulled out a camcorder, and started filming. \"Greetings to our loyal fans,\" Gabe said, \"This is Gabe and Gavin, and special guest Gwen, my wonderful girlfriend,\" I blushed and smiled at that one, \"Or as you knows us- the G's! And I say, thank you for voting for us to play at your prom. We'll make sure it totally rocks!\" I giggled at Gabe's theatrics, but it was cut short when Stacy came over with Kim and said, \"Well, well, well, look who it is, Linkin Bay's own internet sensation.\" I didn't want to be in Stacy's view so I moved around Gavin, and stood by Gabe who wrapped an arm around my waist. \"Hey Stacy,\" Gavin said with a smile. \"Hey Gavin, and Gavin's camera,\" Stacy said, \"I heard you guys are playing Prom. Pretty sweet.\" She then turned and walked away. \"Dude, you are in,\" Gabe said grabbing my hand and pulling me behind him as he and Gavin walked. \"What do you mean?\" Gavin asked confused. \"Stacy and her college boyfriend just called it quits, which means as of right now, she doesn't have a Prom date.\" \"I can't ask her to Prom,\" Gavin said. Gabe laughed and said, \"Didn't you see that?\" He then did this weird thing with his hips and said in a high pitched voice, \"'Hi Gavin.' It's the band man, we're getting some heat. A little attention from the ladies. Your stalk is on the rise, and Stacy's noticing.\" I was having trouble even comprehending that this conversation was even happening. \"What would I even say?\" Gavin asked. As Gabe released my hand to talk to Gavin, I headed over to 3 of my best friends who were talking by the lockers. \"GWENY!\" Sarah yelled and hugged me. \"Sarah, release Gwen, you're killing her,\" Jenna said next. Laura was just laughing. Sarah released me, and I took a deep breath of air. \"I think Gabe just realized that you were gone,\" Jenna said laughing. I turned and saw my boyfriend looking around trying to figure out where I went. \"I'll see you guys in music class. Later,\" I said to them, and headed over to Gabe who was standing alone. I slid my hand in his, and as we started walking he said, \"Where'd you go?\" \"I went to go talk to Sarah, Jenna, and Laura,\" I said as we walked down the hallway. \"You scared me. I thought you had left me for a minute,\" Gabe said wrapping an arm around my shoulders. I rolled my eyes, but said, \"I'm not going to leave you.\" \"Good,\" Gabe said, and as we made it to the hallway where we had to go separate ways he pulled me into his arms and whined, \"I don't want you to go. I haven't seen you all weekend.\" Although I did find it cute that Gabe didn't want to leave me, it kind of made me wonder what was going on with him because he hadn't ever gotten this clingy before. \"I'll sit with you at lunch,\" I said placing a hand on his chest. \"Promise?\" He asked me. \"Promise,\" I said giggling. He leaned down and kissed me and said, \"I'll see you at lunch.\" \"Okay, bye,\" I said, pulled away, and headed down the hallway to my Social Studies class. Gabe POV As I watched Gwen walk away, I almost said it- I love you. I loved Gwen. I had been trying to figure out how to tell her, but we barely spent any time together anymore. And I felt so shitty about it. I watched her butt sway a little as it always did and as she turned another corner, the bell rang, and I turned and ran to class.

Tara was already there, and I knew I was late as the show had already started. Gabe wanted to walk me home so I couldn't run and I couldn't say no with the look he gave me. As we stopped in front of my house, I said, \"I'll see you later.\" I leaned up on my tip-toes and pecked him on the lips. I pulled away, and as I was walking up my steps, he said, \"Hey Gwen?\" I turned and looked at him and said, \"Yeah?\" Gabe looked like he was about to say something, but stopped and then said, \"Be careful.\" \"Um… thanks… I guess…\" I said confused. I finished walking up the stairs, unlocked my door, and ran through the house straight up to Tara's room. I opened the door, hopped on her bed and said, \"Sorry, Gabe wanted to walk me home.\" Tara smiled and said, \"You two are cute.\" I rolled my eyes, but blushed non-the-less, and said, \"Thanks.\" Tara had a song playing when all the sudden there was a knock at the door. I looked through my bag for my notebook as Tara got the door and said, \"Rob, what are you doing here?\" A pause. \"Okay, so thanks for stopping by,\" Tara said, trying to shut the door. Another pause. \"What? Why?\" Tara asked, and I stood up and went over to the door, and Tara said, \"Bye now!\" She attempted to shut the door, but Rob walked in, and said, \"I really thought you'd think so, yah now?\" He smiled at me and said, \"Hey Gwen.\" I waved at him a little, and sat in Tara's spot. \"We have so much in common, ya know?\" Rob said sitting on the bed. \"Yeah, like we're both super busy,\" Tara said. \"Look I know this a very difficult transition for you two, with your dad working in Taiwan, and your mom and I, I just want you to know you have a friend here.\" Rob said, and I looked down at the mention of my Dad. I missed him. \"It's fine, I'm fine, Tara's fine, really,\" I said, and Tara nodded her head. \"So this is good, right? We're hanging out, and we're listening to Radio Rebel. Together.\" Rob said smiling. \"Together,\" Tara said uncertain. Then the music stopped. Oh fuck. \"That's weird,\" Rob said looking at his phone. I turned on the voice modulator, and Tara put on her headset and said, \"And that rounds off the final set for my partner's favorite local band, so here's an extra-long track for you guys, I hope you dig it,\" I turned the song on. \"You-You two are Radio Rebel?\" Rob asked, and I nodded and Tara said, \"That depends, are we in trouble?\" \"No, of course not, I just, how are you two are doing that, you two are so shy,\" Rob said. \"I am,\" Tara said, and I said, \"I'm not shy, I'm just never home.\" \"But they don't, we don't know, it just, works,\" Tara said shrugging. \"I can't believe it, I love it, I just can't believe it. We're gonna take Slam-FM to the next level,\" Rob said getting up, and I said, \"Wait, what?\" \"I'm sorry, we?\" Tara asked. \"Yeah, you're gonna be Slam-FM's next big thing. You're hired, that's for sure, you're hired!\" Rob said, and left the room. Then mom popped in, and said, \"Ah! I was eavesdropping, I hope you don't mind. My babies are going to take Slam FM to the next level!\" Mom then hugged both of us, and I sat down and Mom said, \"What's the matter?\" \"What if I mess it up?\" Tara asked. \"Oh honey, you have to take risks, like I always thought chartreuse was a bad color for me, and I tried it, and now it's my trademark. Honey, you don't know if something is faboo if you never try it, right?\" Mom asked. She then hugged Tara, and kissed me on the head. She left the room but I was glued to my seat. Now I got even less time with Gabe. I groaned. Review? Follow? Favorite? Do whatever you want :) xx[Chapter 3] Summary: Tara's fraternal twin sister is Gabe's girlfriend.

Chapter 3- You Should Have the First Part Gwen POV During Gym Class \"Of course he's taking Stacy to prom,\" Tara said. \"At least you talked to him,\" Audrey said and I said, \"For you that's major progress.\" \"I barely got two words out,\" Tara said. \"Look why don't you two come to my house tonight, we'll do yoga, I'll teach you two the extended hyena pose I invented, and we'll listen to Radio Rebel,\" Audrey said. \"I can't,\" Tara said. \"Neither can I,\" I said. \"What do you two mean? It's the Radio Rebel's first show on Slam-FM. Do you realize how epic that is? They were popular before, but now it's like the whole world will be listening, including us,\" Audrey said. \"I have plans,\" Tara said and I said, \"I have plans with Gabe.\" I lied of course knowing I wasn't going to with Gabe anywhere. *cue internal sad sigh* \"What plans?\" Audrey asked knowing that I wouldn't give up a date with Gabe. \"Family Plans,\" Tara said. \"You are the worst liar, you sound just like you did when said you liked that new haircut I got at the mall,\" Audrey said. \"It wasn't that bad,\" Tara said. \"It was mullet adjacent,\" I said agreeing with Audrey. \"Tell me what you're doing or I'll start screaming in 3 seconds,\" Audrey said. My eyes widened. \"1… 2…\" The Audrey started to scream, and Tara and I slapped our hands over her mouth. \"Well,\" Audrey said, and Tara said, \"I'm sorry, I can't tell you.\" \"I thought I was your BFFTLE,\" Audrey said, and Tara said, \"Without exception.\" \"Then, why don't you trust me?\" Audrey asked. Tara groaned and walked away and I said, \"Well that was interesting.\" Skip To Lunch I sat at a table with Sarah, Jenna, and Laura. We were all talking and I had a notebook down in front of me and Laura said, \"I think you should get the first part.\" \"No,\" I said for the billionth time. \"Ye-\" \"-Hello,\" Gabe said cutting the girls off, and sitting next to me wrapping an arm around me. Garret and Greg came and sat next to Jenna and Sarah who were their boyfriends. Laura had a boyfriend who graduated last year. Laura looked down at her phone, and Gabe leaned his forehead against mine and said, \"Would you like to go to the movies with me tonight?\" I smiled and said, \"What time?\" \"Eight,\" Gabe said, and I quickly did the calculations in my head and said, \"Okay.\" Gabe smiled and leaned forwards kissing me. I wrapped my arms around his neck, and he pulled me closer to him, and all the sudden song lyrics ran through my head. I smiled into the kiss and as Gabe pulled away, I started writing down a section of a song. \"What's that?\" Gabe asked me putting his head on my shoulder and he kissed my neck wrapping his arms securely around my waist. \"Nothing,\" I said in a sing-song voice. He didn't answer as he was too focused on giving me a hickey. At Slam-FM I was sitting next to Tara in a jean skirt, a teal lace shirt, a blue-jean jacket, black ankle boots, and a black fedora. I always wear hats. It was a weird obsession of mine. \"I want Radio Rebel adds in every social network, just blast the internet; updates every hour, we want to blanket the market. Alright, Bye.\" Rob said into his phone. I shared a nervous and scared look with Tara. We both stood up as Rob got off the phone, and he said, \"I was talking with your mom, about keeping the Radio Rebel on the QT, and she thinks it's a good idea. I don't want you two to talk to anyone about it. Radio Rebel is the shot in the arm that Slam-FM needs. Since the last show produced was Snazzy Dog and it crashed and burned there's a lot hanging on this, alright? Including my job. No pressure, okay?\" No pressure my ass. \"So your show's gonna run from 7pm Mondays to Friday because that was the time you two broadcasted from your room, and you will be taking over from DJ fluffy mack who's now moving to Sunday night. So alright, let's show you the booth..\" Rob said. Tara ran off, and I quickly followed her. I saw Tara go into a room and I opened the door, and there was a girl in there. She smiled at us and said, \"Hey, Tara, Gwen! Remember me? Cami Q, we met at the Slam Christmas Party. Girls when Rob told me you two were Radio Rebel this was my face,\" She made a shocked face, \"Because I thought you two were these little shy things. But you two are all kinds of amazing. You two are fierce. I just can't wait to see what you got going for the-\" While Cami had turned Tara had hid between the refrigerator and vending machine. \"Tara?\" Tammi asked, \"Are you okay?\" \"I can't even speak to Gavin without freezing. How am I supposed to speak to all of Seattle?\" Tara asked fear lacing her words. \"It's no different from recording in your bedroom,\" Cami said. \"Yes it is, when I'm in my room I can pretend nobody but Gwen is listening,\" Tara said, \"But now I know that everybody's listening, and Rob's putting all this pressure on it, and mom wants us to have our chartreuse moment, but I don't even like chartreuse; I don't even know what chartreuse is!\" \"Tara, come out where I can see you,\" Cami said and Tara slowly came out. \"Everybody gets nervous, it's totally normal; just consider me like your best friend here at Slam. Catch your breath and then we'll all go out together, okay?\" Cami asked smiling at Tara gently. Tara nodded and I wrapped an arm around her shoulder and said, \"Yeah. Plus, I'm even nervous and I never get nervous.\" \"Never?\" Cami asked me. \"Never,\" Tara and I confirmed. \"Alright then,\" Cami said as we walked into the broadcast room. \"Is this whole booth just for us,\" Tara asked. \"We call this the live room because when that red light is on, you're live,\" Cami said sitting in one of the chairs. \"If you two want to move around, use this headset, so we don't miss anything,\" Cami said. \"There's your vocal masking button but you already know about that, and song selection's up to you,\" Cami said and stood up. Tara sat down in one seat, and I sat in the other. \"There's like 20,000 songs here,\" I said and scrolled down the screen. \"You got some time before you go on, if you want to practice, get comfortable,\" Cami said and I crossed my legs getting comfy. \"Practice, um, maybe I should play a song just to make sure I know how to,\" Tara said, and touched a song and you got the more sped up chipmunk version. \"Bad practice, bad practice,\" Tara said, freaking out. \"Don't worry about it, you two will be fine,\" Cami said. \"I'll be right next door if you need me, just pretend you're in your bedroom,\" Cami said, \"You're on in 15.\" Tara quickly shut the blinds and said, \"We can do this.\" Tara sat d down and took a deep breath. I pressed the vocal masking button and Tara said, \"This is Radio Rebel, live from Slam-FM. Alright. I gotta confess, moving the studio from my bedroom to Slam was a bit terrifying, but life is all about change, right?\" I was scrolling through the songs as Tara talked. \"Maybe some people just want to label you as one thing, analyze you, and then, walk away, we don't have to let that stop us from who we wanna be, like that kid with the remote control car,\" Tara said, \"I mean yeah, maybe he's gonna grow up to build an entire green rocket ship, or that girl who gives everyone carnations on flowers day just so no one feels left out; she could grow up to be president.\" I pointed at a song, and Tara nodded at me. \"Guys if we just drop the labels and cliques and just be ourselves; we have no idea what were capable of. Look if you're all with us on this, then wear red tomorrow, it'll be like saying despite our differences, we're in this together. This song is from Red Letter Day,\" Tara said, and I clicked the song. I smiled at Tara, and we moved away from the mics and smiled at each other. Review, Follow, Favorite?

Gabe/OC I DO NOT OWN LITTLE MIX SONGS OR THE BAND NAME LITTLE MIX. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S. Chapter 4- I Haven't Even Told Gabe Gabe POV I smiled as Gabe held my hand as we walked out of the movie theater. He wrapped an arm around my waist and said, \"That was a pretty good movie.\" I nodded in agreement resting my head leaning my head on his shoulder as we walked. I smiled as he leaned over and kissed my head. \"I feel like we haven't been spending any time together lately,\" Gabe said, \"This is nice.\" I smiled and said, \"We've been busy.\" \"Too busy,\" Gabe said. I nodded in agreement. \"How's the band?\" I asked Gabe. \"We're okay. Doing good,\" Gabe said. I leaned my head on his shoulder. We continued to walk home in a comfortable silence just glad to be in each other's presence. Next Day at School I walked in the school, hand in hand with Gabe. As I saw Tara, and said, \"I'll see you later.\" \"Where are you-\" I cut him off by kissing him. I ran over to Tara and Audrey, and said, \"Hey!\" Tara was wearing a red shirt, and me red tank top, red jean jacket, red high tops, red beanie (I always have a hat), red jewelry, and normal jeans. \"Ahem, do you like my glasses?\" Audrey asked. \"But you have freakishly good vision,\" I said, and Audrey said, \"Fashion shouldn't be functional.\" She then stuck her hand through the lens spot showing that there was no lens. \"Do you know why I picked red rims? I assume you two do because of your red shirts,\" Audrey asked. \"I can't believe all of these people are wearing red, just because Radio Rebel said to. How cool is that?\" Tara said looking around. It looked like the whole hallway was filled with people wearing some sort of red. \"So you two did listen to Radio Rebel last night. What happened to your date and your mystery plans,\" Audrey said. I smiled at the thought of my date with Gabe and said, \"We still went on our date.\" \"Can you guys tell us apart?\" Barry and Larry asked walking over wearing identical red outfits. \"You guys are fraternal, not identical,\" Audrey said and we got in the elevator with them. Tara and I got in, and Tara punched the button. \"Hey, we just ran a recording of Radio Rebel's show through a voice analysis app, and we're closer than ever to uncovering her true identity.\" Barry said as we left the elevator. \"Local twins crack Radio Rebel's ID's,\" Larry said. Tara and I shared creeped out glances. \"Then I'll be able to profess my undying love,\" Barry said. I was more than creeped out now. \"We'll be famous. We could get our own report, or at least our own reality TV show.\" Larry said. \"Where we could be married on live TV,\" Barry said. \"Tara, Gwen, since your Dad runs Slam-FM maybe you could help us out,\" Barry said turning to me and Tara. \"Oh, we're not allowed to go to Slam-FM while she's there-\" \"-To keep the mystery… mysterious,\" I said finishing Tara's sentence. \"The truth is Tara and Gwen don't have time to do friend related things,\" Audrey said. \"Audrey, Audrey,\" Tara said quietly, and I said, \"AUDREY!\" \"What?\" Audrey said. Tara attempted to tell Audrey but she couldn't find the words. \"Forget it, I'm leaving,\" Audrey said starting to walk away. Audrey started walking but I grabbed her arm and pulled her over to Tara who shut a classroom door, so no one would listen in. Tara then said, \"We're about to tell you something so top secret, but you have to promise to never tell anyone.\" I nodded at Tara letting her know I was okay with telling Audrey. \"I won't tell, I swear, you can say it,\" Audrey said. I nodded, urging Tara. Tara mumbled so low I couldn't understand her. \"Tara, you have to breathe your words,\" Audrey said, and Tara mumbled it again, and Audrey said, \"Louder, come on, breathe the words.\" \"We're Radio Rebel,\" Tara said. \"Oh. I don't believe you.\" Later that Day \"If you're like us and believe music can change the world one track at a time,\" Tara said and I clicked on her song also cutting off Tara's voice modulator. Audrey had a headset and she had a shocked look, \"Oh my gosh I can't believe she's you and your them, I mean you're the last people I would've expected to be Radio Rebel. Plus I didn't expect there to be two,\" Audrey said. \"It's been driving us crazy not telling you, and of course we wanna hang out but we've been doing our show,\" Tara said. \"Here's the thing you can't tell anyone, not even Larry and Barry, because Slam wants to keep it this big secret and so do we,\" I said, \"I haven't even told Gabe.\" Audrey squealed and hugged us both.

Gabe/OC I DO NOT OWN LITTLE MIX SONGS OR THE BAND NAME LITTLE MIX. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S. Chapter 5- I Don't Want to do this in a Hallway Gwen POV I walked down the hallway, by the auditorium, going through my lyric papers. I heard talking as I passed and I stopped and walked back a couple steps. It was Stacy, Tara, and Gavin. I stopped- not interrupting- but still hiding. \"Wait Tara did you wanna say something?\" Gavin asked. \"No she's fine, action!\" Stacy said impatiently. I hate her so much. \"Cut. Tara you listen to Radio Rebel, right?\" Gavin asked stopping Stacy. Tara nodded, and Gavin said, \"You were wearing red yesterday, so I figured. Rebel is right, life's about taking risks and making changes, so go ahead, say what you feel.\" GO GAVIN! Tara turned to Stacy who crossed her arms. \"It's just that the scene was about us falling for each other, even though we don't know it and...\" Tara started. \"Blocking like this feels weird right?\" Gavin asked walking towards Tara. Oh yay, this is progress. \"Right exactly, the audience is supposed to get what we're feeling without us saying anything and it only works if were closer,\" Tara said also walking forwards. I had a shit-eating grin on my face as I walked down the hallway again. As I stuck my books in my locker, I was turned around and pushed against the locker beside mine. Gabe leaned down and kissed me, and I wrapped my arms around his neck, and he licked my bottom lip, and I teased him, not letting him in. He soon forced his way in, and I opened my mouth wider. \"Hi,\" I said pulling away breathing heavily. \"Hi,\" Gabe said smirking at me. I smiled and kissed his neck. I grabbed my backpack, shut my locker door, and walked away. But I felt Gabe grab my hand again pulling me back into him. \"So you're just gonna leave me?\" Gabe asked. I nodded smirking. Gabe smirked, and leaned down placing a kiss on my neck and started sucking. I pushed him away and said, \"Stop it.\" \"Why?\" Gabe asked, \"You know you like it.\" \"Yeah, but I don't want to do this in a hallway,\" I said and walked off. \"Gwen, I'm sorry,\" Gabe called after me. I got in the car, and Tara started driving away from the school. My phone start ringing and I turned it off, knowing it was Gabe. \"You okay?\" Tara asked me. I smiled a fake smile at her, and said, \"Yeah. I'm fine.\" She looked at me unconvinced, but said, \"No. Tell me.\" I sighed and said, \"Something just happened with Gabe.\" \"Did you two get into a fight?\" Tara asked me. \"I don't know… kind of,\" I said sighing. \"I'm sorry, Gwen,\" Tara said, and I shrugged and said, \"It happens.\" After School At Slam I sat on the couch not doing anything. Tara just told me to sit knowing I really didn't have the heart to do the show today. \"You guys at Linkin Bay High killed it with the red yesterday. I noticed one of you wearing red specs that were the epitome of cool.\" Tara said and loaded a disk into the player. I raised an eyebrow. \"But can we talk about what's not cool for a second, I mean the school keeps confiscating our stuff, I mean, in just this term alone, I lost 2 MP3 players. Though I did notice that some of us seem to be exempt from this stuff snatching epidemic; funny how that works, huh?\" Tara asked. I wrapped my arms around my legs, and I leaned my head on my knees. \"It's not just our Playlists and Players were being deprived of yah know? Music is the soundtrack to our lives it's where we've been, and where were going, and everywhere in-between. Our music is who we are, and are we gonna let someone just snatch that away from us? Or are we gonna change the game?\" Tara asked. \"So here's a new song about trying things you never thought you could, look I've been trying to do a bunch of new things lately and this song severely inspires me,\" Tara said, \"Now we know one of you may know this song already, but we want you guys who haven't to vibe it, really, really, dig on it, and then remember that feeling. So tomorrow we want all you guys at 8:00 am to get up and dance, express yourself!\" \"This is 'Turn it all around' by the G's,\" Tara said, and hit the song. I felt my eyes widen as I said, \"Tara!\" She smiled and I smirked shaking my head chuckling. I couldn't resist as we both got up and started dancing. AN: This is not the main conflict.

Chapter 6- Sorry I Made You Horny Gwen POV Next Day at School I shook my head smiling as I watched Sarah, Jenna, and Laura did the wave in front of me, and I couldn't help but start laughing. They high-fived and cheered saying, \"We got her to smile!\" I still didn't feel that great for what had happened with Gabe, and I hadn't smiled at all that morning. Well, until a few minutes ago that is. Suddenly the music was cut off, and everyone stopped dancing as Moreno said, \"This is a place of learning, not dancing, and anyone listening to Radio Rebel during school will be suspended, and Radio Rebel I advise you to turn yourself in now or your future will be Radio silence.\" Then Moreno stopped talking, and the teacher said, \"Alright, just do whatever you want this period since half of its gone.\" I grabbed my notebook, and flipped to a page. \"Whatcha working on?\" Sarah asked me leaning over the back of her desk to look at my writing. \"Just a song,\" I said as I wrote down another line. Laura grabbed the notebook from me and I said, \"Give it back!\" \"No,\" Jenna said as she looked over Laura's shoulder. Sarah ran around them and read too. \"Gwen… is something going on with you and-\" \"-Gabe?\" Laura was cut off by Sarah who was looking at the door to the classroom. I turned and saw Gabe with the rest of the GGGG's. I cringed and quickly turned back around hoping that they wouldn't notice me. I turned back to the girls and they were all watching me closely. \"By looking at your reaction to him coming in the room- that's a yes,\" Jenna said. I sighed and said, \"I don't know. We just got really… into each other in the hallway yesterday-\" \"-You had sex in the hallway!?\" Jenna whisper yelled to me. \"Hell no!\" I yelled. \"Miss Adams- language,\" The teacher said scolding me. \"Sorry…\" I said. I looked at the girls and they were all laughing at me. I chose the heaviest textbook in my bag and threw it at them. They all shut up when it knocked them all off balance. I smiled triumphantly. Once they all stood back up, Jenna said, \"What do you mean then?\" \"We kinda…\" I rubbed the back of my neck and quietly said, \"Kinda made-out pretty heavily in the hallway…\" They all looked at me with wide eyes. \"Oh my God,\" Laura said, \"…You're not innocent anymore.\" She pretended to cry. I rolled my eyes, and the bell rang for next period. I was about to grab my notebook from Laura when Sarah saw me, grabbed the notebook, and ran out of the room yelling, \"MOVE IT PEOPLE!\" \"Shit!\" I cussed, and ran down the hall after her. I brushed by the GGGG's and yelled, \"SARAH!\" \"NEVER!\" Sarah yelled. \"COME HERE!\" I yelled running after her. At Lunch I was waving my soaking wet notebook out on the lunch table while glaring at Sarah. \"I said I was sorry…\" Sarah muttered. \"It's fine,\" I said flipping carefully through the pages. \"It's not… that bad,\" I said. Sarah smiled at me and I turned to the entrance of the cafeteria to see Tara talking with Audrey when Gavin came around the corner and said something to them. \"Oh, what is happening there?\" Laura asked. I shrugged and watched carefully until someone stepped into my line of sight. I simply looked around them as I watched Tara and Gabe. I heard laughter and turned to see Garret and Greg. I raised an eyebrow and then realized it was Gabe in front of me. I simply said, \"Hi.\" \"Can we talk?\" He asked. I nodded and said, \"We are talking.\" \"In private,\" Gabe said. I sighed and said, \"Alright.\" I stood up and followed him to an empty table. I sat down beside him and he said, \"I'm sorry about yesterday.\" I sighed and said, \"It was my fault too. I'm sorry for making your horny.\" Gabe laughed and wrapped his arms around me. I smiled and leaned into him. We went back to the table and we all sat there together the whole lunch period talking about music and random things. It was close to the end of lunch period and I was in-between Gabe's legs as his arms were wrapped around me when Stacy walked over. This isn't good. \"Gwen, can I borrow you for a tiny second?\" She asked me. I looked at her confused but none-the-less stood up from my very comfortable spot (Gabe didn't seem to like that I left either.) I followed Stacy and I asked her, \"What do you need, Stacy?\" \"I need your help writing a song,\" Stacy said. I felt my eyebrows shoot up into my hairline. \"Why?\" \"Music class.\" \"You're in drama,\" I corrected. Stacy then grinned and said, \"I knew it!\" \"Knew what?\" \"You do like me!\" She sounded triumphant. I raised my eyebrows and said, \"I'm going to be nice and just leave now.\" I headed back over to the table and Gabe gladly wrapped me back up in his arms. Later that Day I was outside the Slam with Tara as we hid behind a bush because we saw Larry and Barry. I looked around and I noticed a trash guy and said, \"Tara.\" I pointed at it, we ran over, opened the door, and we ran in before anyone noticed us. Hopefully. Tara opened the blinds and Cami jumped out of her skin, while throwing her popcorn all over the place. She yelled something, but Tara and I couldn't tell what she said. I made a confused face and she came out and said, \"Did you see the posters?\" \"Hard to miss, they're everywhere,\" Tara said, and I sat down in my chair and said, \"Our mom just called and said she saw us on the bus, and I said, 'no we're at Slam', she said, 'no, no, no, you're on the bus, the side of it.'\" \"They're spending money on marketing for you two, which means the ratings must be up. You two are famous!\" Cami said. \"No, we're not,\" Tara said, and I said, \"Radio Rebel is. Even Gavin has a thing for her.\" \"Seriously?\" I asked her. She nodded. I sighed and said, \"I need to have a serious talk with that boy.\" \"That's good, we like Gavin right?\" Cami asked and Tara said, \"Yes we do. It was just hard enough when I had just Stacy to deal with; now I'm competing with myself for his attention and I appear to be losing.\" \"You two have got fan clubs at every school in Seattle. I mean look at all the petitions,\" Cami said. We looked at the computer which was lit up, \" We want a dance break every day. We want more of Radio Rebel. Don't take our music away .\" I stood up with a smirk on my face, \"Okay, I have a really good idea, this is what we're gonna do…\" Review, Follow, Favorite?

Chapter 7- He Loves Her A Lot Gwen POV You could hear the music blaring out of the Slam-FM car speakers for miles as students poured outside to dance. I walked out of the school with Sarah, Jenna, Laura, Garret, Gavin, and Greg. My hand was intertwined with Gabe's. We went over to a table and Jenna, Laura, Sarah, and I sat down. Gavin sat on top of the table and Gabe, Garret, and Greg stood. 3 rd POV Tara was leaned against the wall and Audrey came over saying, \"What is going on?\" \"Well no one can complain about us missing class time, because it's lunch,\" Tara answered while smirking. \"This was your idea?\" Audrey asked, and Tara shook her head no saying, \"It was all Gwen's idea.\" As they watched all the kids dance Tara said, \"Isn't it awesome?\" \"Ah! It's brill!\" Audrey said. They looked over at Gwen who was currently talking to Gabe before he pulled her up and wrapped her in his arms. \"He's so soft with her,\" Audrey said. Tara nodded and said, \"I once talked to him and he talked about her like she was everything to him. He loves her a lot.\" Gwen POV I had my head leaning on Gabe's shoulder and my arms wrapped around his waist as we stood together. He had pulled me up and into him when I started shivering. Now I was warm and cozy in my boyfriend's arms. \"Hey, hey, hey, Linkin Bay! This is Cami Q, coming at you live, y'all feeling good today?!\" Cami asked and raised her mic. There were cheers and I smiled. \"Alright, I got a special message from our good friend, Radio Rebel!\" Cami said and pressed play. \"This is Radio Rebel coming at you with a little lunch time surprise,\" Tara's voice said filling the air, \"Now a lot of you have IM'd me talking about the powers to be taking away our music and it feels like part of ourselves has been taken away. That's not gonna make us better students and you can't punish someone for relaxing during their down time, right principal Moreno?\" I chuckled and Gabe leaned down and kissed me on the head. \"That's right, you took our music, and we're giving it back, text and request because lunch time is our time,\" Tara's voice said, and everyone cheered. Cami then started the music, and I laughed as I watched Tara and Audrey dance. Gabe didn't move and neither did I. We were content where we were. Later at School \"CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!\" Moreno yelled. I looked up while stopping my conversation with Jenna and I focused on Moreno. \"I want you all to know that this lunchtime fiasco was a… fiasco!\" Moreno yelled. Jenna and I looked at each other and snickered. \"It is time for a certain DJ's rain of rebellion to come to an end,\" Moreno said, \"So, anyone with any information regarding the identity of these Radio Rebels, is to report it to me immediately. Or risk facing disciplinary actions themselves. Now get to class.\" Later at Slam-FM I smiled as Tara said, \"If you don't go to Linkin Bay High, you missed out on a rockstar day. I've never seen so many people dancing before, but our listeners at Hoover High were so inspired by what went down at Linkin Bay, they had a full on flash mob at lunch today, how cool is that?! You guys totally need to post a video on our webpage stat.\" I brought my knees up to my chest as I texted Gabe. He was being really clingy lately… \"I heard the Mathletes at Edson high just formed a pop, non pop alliance club, you guys are my heroes!\" Tara said, \"And we got a call today from a guy who graduated high school 20 years ago; he said this show inspired him to stand up to his boss and get the raise he deserved. See what I mean, it's never too late to make a difference guys.\" I then played a song and Tara said, \"This is one of my favorites, I hope you enjoy.\" Tara moved away from the mic and said, \"Gwen, can I talk to you?\" I nodded at Tara telling her to continue. \"I found your song book…\" Tara said. I nodded. \"I know how well you sing and-\" \"-No. No, no, no, no, no,\" I said standing up. \"But We Are Who We Are would be a perfect song for the show!\" Tara said standing up too. I sighed and said, \"Even if I was- and I'm not saying that I am- it's for four people. Specifically Jenna, Sarah, Laura, and myself.\" \"Well call them-\" \"-I'll talk to them about it tomorrow. I still have to tell them about all of this.\" \"Okay, okay.\" Tara said with a sigh. I then rushed to my phone when there was a beep. \"A little eager?\" She asked sitting back down. I blushed.

I sat down as we took a break and said, \"Perfect. She's perfect.\" \"Aw, Gabe's in love,\" Greg said with a chuckle. There was a knock on the garage door and I stood up and opened it. I was met with Gwen's face. I smiled and took her in my arms as Jenna went to Garret. Gavin and Greg sat watching us. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked her pulling her in the garage. \"We were heading over to my house from Jenna's and we decided to stop by,\" Gwen explained. I smiled and Jenna looked at her phone with a groan. \"We better go before we're any later. Laura is already scheming our deaths,\" Jenna said. I winced and hugged Gwen tighter. Gwen smiled and leaned her head on my arm. \"Do you have to go?\" I asked her as she got in Jenna's car. She nodded and said, \"Sadly, yes. Laura will kill us if we're any later.\" I sighed and leaned in the window kissing her one more time. She smiled and I pulled out of the window and they drove off. Next Day at School \"Definitely.\" \"You know my answer.\" \"Of course!\" I smiled as I listened to the girls' answers. I had just finished explaining how Tara was the voice of Radio Rebel and I was her technician. They were ecstatic. Even better was that they swore they wouldn't tell anyone. I hugged them all and said, \"We can head over there after school.\" \"Will do,\" They all said but then Jenna said, \"But it has to end before seven thirty. My mom is making me babysit the neighbors' kids again.\" \"Aren't they the ones who-\" \"-Threw up in my hair and trashed the house- yes, yes they are,\" Jenna said interrupting Laura. Laura, Sarah, and I all paused for a second and then laughed. \"I'm sorry but you have to admit, it's a little funny,\" I said between laughs. Jenna rolled her eyes and said, \"Meet me at the flagpole. I'm driving.\" Soon Laura and Sarah left to go to their classes and I was walking down the hallway on my own. I then heard, \"GWEN!\" I turned around and saw Audrey. She grabbed my hand and said, \"I have news, but we can't talk here.\" I raised an eyebrow as Audrey grabbed Tara also and tugged us into a closet and said to the Janitor, \"Excuse me, can you excuse us a minute?\" \"But this is my office,\" The janitor said, and Audrey motioned for him to get out. \"So, guess who got nominated for prom queen?\" Audrey asked once the door was shut, and Tara said, \"Stacy.\" \"NO, YOU!\" Audrey said, \"Well, not you, but Radio Rebel.\" \"This is horrible,\" Tara said, \"The whole point of Radio Rebel is that she's anonymous, remember?\" \"What happens if she wins, who's going up there to accept the crown? We could get expelled.\" I explained, \"We have to put a stop to this.\" Tara nodded in agreement. \"Are you serious? You two can't quit now,\" Audrey said and the door opened. Audrey quickly said, \"Not now, Mr. McGowski.\" \"But I need the broom,\" Mr. McGowski said. Audrey handed him it and shut the door. \"Audrey, we can't do this anymore,\" Tara said, and I nodded and said, \"I can't keep hiding this from Gabe. I'm starting to think he thinks I'm cheating on him because I spend such little time with him anymore.\" \"You can,\" Audrey said, \"And he's an idiot if he thinks that.\" \"I can't,\" Tara said. \"You can,\" Audrey said. \"I can't,\" I said. \"You can,\" Audrey said, and Tara and I said together, \"WE CAN'T!\" The door reopened and we all said, \"NOT NOW!\" \"I need the dustpan too,\" Mr. McGowski said. Tara handed it to him and I shut the door. \"You're heroes to people and that's why they nominated you,\" Audrey said, \"You can't turn your back on them now. This is your time to shine.\" \"What if we don't want to shine?\" I asked. \"What if shining isn't really our thing?\" Tara asked. \"As your BFFTLEWE, I am legally obligated to make sure you two do the show. Even if I have to drag you both there,\" Audrey said. We chuckled, and walked out of the closet as the bell rang. I was walking with Tara and we ran into Gavin. \"Hey Tara, we got another demo on the way for Radio Rebel,\" Gavin said. \"Oh well I'm sure she'd be stoked to hear it,\" Tara replied, and I said to Tara, \"I have to get to class. See you later, Gavin.\" \"Later Gwen,\" Gavin said as I walked away. I was quickly wrapped in a pair of arms and I smiled as Gabe said, \"Guess who?\" I paused and said, \"Zayn Malik?\" \"No,\" Gabe said, \"You're awesome, loving, talented-\" \"-Big-headed-\" \"-Boyfriend,\" Gabe finished. I smiled and rolled my eyes. He leaned down and kissed me. I smiled and said, \"Walk me to class?\" \"Always,\" Gabe said as he took my hand. \"Why did I have to wear heels and wigs?\" Sarah groaned as we walked into Slam. \"Because you're short and have a fake hair color. We needed you to be tall and have a normal hair color.\" Laura said. In Slam I ruffled my hair as Sarah, Jenna, and Laura followed in the studio behind me. Sarah stopped and said, \"Whoa.\" \"I want one,\" Jenna said quietly. \"This is awesome,\" Laura commented. I smiled as Cami came out and said, \"So these are the girls I've heard so much about. Let me guess,\" She pointed at Sarah, \"Jenna?\" I laughed and said, \"That's Sarah. This is Jenna and that's Laura.\" Cami blushed and said, \"I thought I had it.\" Tara and Audrey then walked into the broadcasting booth and Tara said, \"This is where the magic happens.\" \"This is so cool,\" Audrey said and she saw me and hugged me quickly. She then hugged the girls. \"Well is this the famous Audrey Sharma?\" Cami asked hugging Audrey. We all turned as the door opened. \"Could you girls excuse us for a moment?\" Rob asked motioning looking at Tara and me. Audrey, Jenna, Laura, Sarah, and Cami all nodded before leaving the room. \"Look if this is about Audrey and the girls being here then I swear they're the only people we've told-\" \"No, it's not about your friends, this is about you two. Principal Moreno called. The lunch time dance party was a mistake. She wants to expel Radio Rebel and anyone helping her as soon as she finds out who they are,\" Rob said. I felt my eyes widen. \"Well as long as she doesn't know it's us then we shouldn't have a problem,\" Tara noted. \"Well I can't take that chance though can I?\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Look I may run Slam-FM, but I'm a step-father first, and it's unfortunate but this has gone too far,\" Rob said. If I wasn't mad, I would've been touched. \"Yes it has, it's too far to stop now. Look this is bigger than Slam or Moreno or even us, we can't turn our backs on the thousands of people who finally feel like they have a voice, and I'm not going back to that shy invisible girl who's afraid to even speak,\" Tara said. \"Look we know that it's risky but we are not going to back down,\" I said. \"You know I think that's the most I've heard you say at one time,\" Rob said, \"You're on in two minutes. Good luck.\" \"A lot of you want to know who I am, I get that. I might be easier if you could see my face.\" Tara said, \"But that's the thing, guys it's not about me, it's about you. So you don't need to know my name. You want to know who I am? I'm somebody who's tired of being afraid. I know how it can hold you back, just, say what you're afraid of. Call in. I dare you.\" After a few seconds nothing came up and I shrugged. Tara then said, \"I guess everyone's too afraid to say what they're scared of. Here, maybe this song will inspire you-\" There was a knock at the window, and Cami said, \"Lines 1-20!\" I looked at the lines, and they were all blinking. I clicked one and Tara said, \"You're on with Radio Rebel.\" Gavin's voice said, \"I'm afraid to do my own thing.\" \"I was too,\" Tara said. \"Was? So what changed?\" Gavin asked. \"I guess I started doing the show and I realized you're not alone as you feel. If you can remember that then it makes it easier to take a risk, ya know, do your own thing,\" Tara said. \"Thanks,\" Gavin said, and the call ended. I smiled and Tara said, \"Okay we're gonna take some more calls in a minute, but for the mean time you guys are gonna seriously dig this song,\" I pressed a song on the screen and the music played. Tara took off her headset and headed for the door while Audrey ran out of the other room. \"Where are you going?\" Audrey asked. I stood next to Tara knowing we both had the same idea. \"Just somewhere, to do something.\" I followed Tara up to the roof and she said, \"I'm afraid to show everyone the real me!\" Tara smiled at me and I yelled, \"I'm afraid to show everyone that I can sing!\" Tara smiled and hugged me. We headed back into the studio and Tara said, \"You guys ready?\" I gulped and said, \"Let's do this.\" Sarah, Jenna, and Laura smiled at me. \"Alright guys. I have some very special guests for you all. I have a live band. They're close friends of mine and they call themselves Little Mix.\" (AN: I couldn't think of a better band name but to let you all know. Gwen is Perrie, Sarah is Jade, Jenna is Jesy, Laura is Leigh-Anne.) I sat at one of the mics and took a deep breath as I played the music.

Gwen POV Next Day At School \"This is your principal, there's been some controversy about the identity of the Radio Rebel and this Little Mix and there is more distraction than controversy. Now I gave Radio Rebel the chance to do the right thing and turn herself in, but instead she chose more people to get in on her lies and chose to hide avoiding the consequences of her insubordination. Well they can't hide forever which is why until Radio Rebel and Little Mix's identities are revealed, I'm cancelling the prom. For everyone. Now do you think there's favoritism at Linkin Bay?\" Principal Moreno said. I felt my eyes widen. The intercom shut off and people started talking angrily. \"This is bad-\" \"-This is terrible.\" After school at slam \"Prom is a right of passage! If Radio Rebel is all about the people then she'll reveal her identity and give us our prom back!\" Stacy said into her mic. Tara, Audrey, Sarah, Jenna, Laura, and I were in the middle of the crowd holding picket signs trying to blend in. \"How are we gonna get in?\" Laura asked. I saw Cami and I said, \"Look!\" We mouthed, help! She held up a finger and mouthed, \"Hold on.\" \"Who do you blame for your prom getting canceled?\" A reporter asked Tara. Before anything was said Sarah yelled, \"LOOK IT'S RADIO REBEL!\" Everyone chased after Cami with her hood up and we all ran for the entrance. Once we got in, we dropped the signs and I said, \"That was close.\" Tara nodded and we collapsed in different seats. On the show \"Hey out there in Radio land, a lot's happened since we last hung out huh?\" Tara asked, \"Look I know you guys are upset, but I'm going hear what you think. I'm not gonna shut you out, so call us, text us, scrawl on our wall, we wanna know what you think.\" I then pressed a caller button and now- thinking about it- was a stupid idea. After a lot of insults, I was gripping the necklace Gabe gave me tightly and taking deep breaths. \"You guys are being honest about how you feel,\" Tara said. I clicked a caller and she said, \"You're on Line 2.\" \"I've always liked you, your playlists totally rock but,\" Gavin paused, \"Go ahead, let it out,\" Tara said. \"It's just I was hoping to impress a girl that night,\" Gavin said. I sighed and Audrey muttered, \"Stacy.\" \"Sorry about that,\" Tara said. Gavin sighed and said, \"Yeah, me too.\" \"Well, I guess you guys are pretty upset, so I'll uh just play some music,\" Tara said and I pressed a random song. \"This one's for you guys thanks for being honest with us, and we're really sorry we let you down,\" Tara said. Laura came over and hugged me as I leaned on her. \"They're just angry, you know they'll come around. It doesn't take away from all the good things you two have done as Radio Rebel,\" Rob said entering the room. \"Did you hear them? They hate us. We ruined their prom. I feel horrible,\" I said and buried my head in my arms. Tara came over and rubbed my back. I was fine with people calling me ugly, a slut, etcetera. But that was because I knew they weren't true (I'm not trying to be vain here,) but when it comes down to people hating me for something I did, it home in places where I was vulnerable and I felt terrible. \"You two didn't ruin it, that Principal did,\" Cami said. \"We knew she was angry, but I didn't know she would do something like this,\" Tara said standing up. \"Man, that Moreno is such a backwards thinker,\" Cami said. Backwards thinker... I shared a look with Tara and she smiled at me and we said, \"Backwards.\" Afterwards \"Ugh, I though everyone would be gone by now,\" Tara said as we hid behind numerous poles. Jenna then said, \"Gwen, sandwich, 9, o'clock.\" I looked over and smirked saying said, \"Time for a professional.\" After Call \"Somebody order the meaty subtacular?\" The Sandwich said coming in. \"HELLO?!\" The sandwich said, and Tara, Audrey, Sarah, Jenna, Laura, and I popped our heads up and the sandwich jumped back. \"Hi, could you do us a favor?\" I asked sweetly. \"You want uh, extra marinara?\" The sandwich asked. \"That would be awesome-\" \"Audrey!\" Tara and I said, and Audrey then said, \"And focusing. I am a hyena.\" I gave her a look that said, what the fuck? Laura didn't waste any time as she said, \"You see those girls out there?\" The sandwich looked back, \"We need to get out of here without any of them seeing us.\" The sandwich leaned forwards and said, \"You can count on me.\" We walked around the back and I smiled seeing his dancing moves. \"Good morning Lincoln Bay High School, this is Cami Q from Slam FM bringing you a special message from-\" \"Radio Rebel here!\" I heard Tara's voice say, \"You guys really unleashed your fury about the Prom drama and Little Mix and I want you to know you've totally been heard; cancelling prom was totally unfair but blaming Moreno isn't going to solve anything. We want to do something about it, and so does Slam. Which is why we're giving you all what you want, your Prom back!\" Everyone cheered, and the girls and I grinned at each other. \"Slam FM is throwing its first ever Morp, that's prom spelt backwards because were turning prom upside down. Tickets are free and everyone is invited, so don't worry about finding a date or spending your college savings on a dress or a tux or a limo. Just come as you are because that's the way we like you.\" I was writing down lyrics in my notebook at lunch when Gabe sat down in front of me. I looked up at smiled at him. He smiled and said, \"Would you like to go to Morp with me?\" I pretended to think about it and said, \"I don't know, my boyfriend might get upset…\" Gabe playfully glared at me and I smiled and said, \"Definitely.\" \"Great,\" Gabe said and he got up and kissed me. I smiled at him and he said, \"I've got to head back to music class. I'm late on an assignment. I'll see you later.\" He then ran off and I shook my head smiling and turned back to my writing. Later at Slam \"So we've been getting a lot of questions about the Morp which rules because you all seem stoked to go,\" Tara said, \"Which is the whole point right? A party where everyone feels like royalty, but then again maybe we should crown a Morp king and queen. I mean after all people were nominated.\" I looked at her confused. When did she decide this? \"And if that's what you guys want then that's what we'll do. Morp is all yours so make sure to vote for your favorite Morp King and Queen. Make your voices heard,\" Tara said, \"Especially my number one fan.\" I narrowed my eyes. What did she just do? AN: I had to post one more chapter before I went to sleep. By the way, all of your reviews are adorable and some of them make me wonder if you know what's going through my mind. ]Alas, the cuteness between Gwen and Gabe will come to an end in the next chapter.

Chapter 10-What'd you do Gwen POV Next Day at School- At Lunch I was sitting on the edge of the table as I read my notes. \"Gwen, relax. You'll do fine.\" Jenna said trying to calm me down. I stayed up till one am writing new song lyrics that kept going over and over in my head. I forgot that we had a history test the next day so I fell asleep without studying. Gabe came over and he kissed me on the head and I didn't even look up. \"What's with her?\" He asked sitting down next to me. \"She's freaking out because she forgot to study for the history test,\" Laura explained. \"Babe, it's an easy test. Relax.\" Gabe said pulling my notes from my hands. I sighed and looked down at him. He smiled at me and I got down from the table and sat next to him instead. I think I melted into his side. I walked down the hallway and into the auditorium. Stacy smiled at me as she passed and said, \"Gwen, there's a part at my house at seven. Be there?\" I nodded and said, \"Sure.\" \"Great!\" She then walked out of the auditorium. I walked over to Tara who stood there a little stunned. \"Tara, you okay?\" I asked her. She shook her head and said, \"Gwen, Stacy knows.\" I felt my throat drop into my stomach. Stacy's Party \"Hi,\" Tara and I said as we walked into Stacy's house. \"Here I am,\" Tara said and I smiled. \"So I see, but I'm still watching you.\" Stacy said, \"Have fun, Gwen.\" I went and sat next to Sarah who was sitting next to Barry. She hugged me and said, \"Jenna and Laura are on their way.\" \"This is Radio Rebel live from Slam-FM, tonight, is all about you. Lines are open, you know the number.\" I heard Tara's voice say. \"I'm calling to the show,\" Stacy said and I felt my eyebrow shoot up. \"How are you both here, and there?\" Sarah asked. I smiled and didn't say anything. \"You're on with Radio Rebel,\" Tara's voice said and Stacy said, \"Do you know you're a hypocrite?\" \"Hi, what's your name caller?\" Tara asked. \"Save it, you say you're all about the people, but Morp is all about you,\" Stacy said, \"You get to log more queen votes on the radio, every night. Not fair! More Morp nominees should get air time, meaning me!\" \"I totally hear you,\" Tara's voice said. \"I don't think you do.\" \"Say what you want to say,\" Tara's voice said. I looked up and saw Jenna and Laura walking in. I stood up and hugged them. Tara got up and left the room, pulling out her phone. I pulled the girls down. I hope she knew what she was doing… Tara came out a little bit later, and Audrey said, \"That was amazing! She was absolutely freaked out.\" I hugged Tara and said, \"Well done, sis.\" I turned and saw Gavin smile at Tara. I smirked and said, \"And Gavin just smiled at you.\" \"I think that was more of a general smile.\" I shot her a glare, and Gabe saw me and smiled at me. Tara then said, \"Now that wasn't a general smile.\" I grinned and said, \"Oh, no. I think that was more of a general smile .\" Tara rolled her eyes at me and Audrey said, \"They both seemed pretty specific to me.\" Sarah came and grabbed me saying, \"I need to borrow you for a minute.\" She dragged me over to Jenna and Laura and I said, \"What?\" I heard Gabe say, \"We are the G's and this is We so Fly. \" \"Your step-Dad just called and said that he wants us to sing at Morp.\" \"What?\" I asked shocked. Jenna nodded and said, \"That would give our identities away completely.\" \"Let's not worry about it right now,\" I said, \"I have a boyfriend on stage.\" The girls laughed and we turned to watch the boys on stage. Later at the Party \"Okay, you can do it, just go over there,\" Tara said, and I said, \"Tara…\" I pointed behind her and Tara turned around and there was Gavin. I smiled and said, \"I have to go find Gabe, I'll see you both later.\" I walked through the house, in doors, and even resorted to knocking on bathroom doors and asking. I was so confused- where was Gabe? I walked down a hall a little farther and I felt my heart break, crash and burn, and turn into dust. Kim and Gabe were making out and it was pretty heated. Stacy then walked over- I guess it was close to her room- and she stopped and her eyes widened considerably. My mind was fuzzy, I wasn't able to comprehend anything, and I felt my whole world just got hit by a meteor and was wiped out… the unsuspecting victims never stood a chance. \"What the hell!?\" Stacy yelled. Gabe and Kim turned around. Gabe's eyes looked like they were about to pop out of his head when he saw me. I was only able to break my necklace off from around my neck, throw it at him before the tears starting coming. I ran down the steps, and my eyes were so blurry I couldn't see anything. I ran into Laura- literally. She grabbed me and said, \"Gwen?\" She saw me crying, \"Gwen, what's wrong? What happened?\" Gabe came running down the stairs and Laura quickly pushed me behind her. I love her so much. \"What'd you do!?\" Laura asked him angrily. Sarah, Jenna, and Tara saw and came over quickly. Tara wrapped her arms around me hugging me as the girls formed a kind of barrier in front of me so he couldn't see me. Stacy then inserted herself into the conversation as she came down the stairs and said, \"Gwen and I walked in on Gabe and Kim.\" I think Laura was about to pounce on him before Jenna and Sarah grabbed her holding her back. \"You self-centered, big-headed, moronic, fuck-up, egotistical, piece of shit, loser!\" Laura yelled. Everyone was watching us and I was still sniffling and crying but I was watching Laura closely. She'd never responded that badly when my other boyfriend, Jace, cheated on me. Laura took a deep breath and said, \"I feel better now.\" The girls released her and Laura instead turned around, wrapped her arms around me, and escorted me out of the house. Gabe POV \"What happened to being so deeply in love with Gwen it hurt?\" Gavin asked me angrily as we put all of the band gear up. I shook my head and said, \"I don't know. I was... frustrated, Gwen wasn't around so-\" \"-So you thought it'd be okay to cheat on her!?\" Garret asked. I sat down in the back of the truck and said, \"I didn't want to hurt her.\" \"You didn't hurt her,\" Greg said looking up from his phone, \"You destroyed her. Jenna texted me and said that Gwen can't even go into her house. She walks one step and then practically collapses because she's crying too hard. They had to get her Step-Dad to carry her inside.\" Gavin glared at me and said, \"Gwen was in love with you. We all saw it. She treated you like a king, she supported you in everything, helped you with school, made sure you had somewhere to go if your parents were arguing at night. She did everything for you.\" \"And you repaid her like she was some petty-servant girl,\" Garret said. AN: Dun dun dunnnnn.

Gabe/OC I DO NOT OWN LITTLE MIX SONGS OR THE BAND NAME LITTLE MIX. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S. Chapter 11- Change Your Life Gwen POV I walked out of the house and got into Jenna's car. Sarah and Laura were in the back. \"How are you holding up?\" Jenna asked giving my hand a squeeze. I gave them a small smile. \"Let's go,\" Sarah said noticing my discomfort with where the conversation was headed, \"Ms. Connors said she had something important today. I'm hoping it's where we watch different movies for a week again.\" We all laughed at her and Jenna drove on. \"Tara didn't want a ride?\" Laura asked. I shook my head no and said, \"She said she would walk with Audrey.\" \"Alright then,\" Jenna said. I sat back and just listened to them talk about anything except boys. My friends knew me so well. \"WAIT A SECOND!\" Sarah suddenly yelled as we got out of the car. People were looking at us as I said, \"What?\" \"You're not wearing a hat,\" Laura noticed. I shrugged and Sarah started hyperventilating saying, \"We need to get her to a hospital. Like now.\" I giggled and lopped my arm with hers and we walked into school together. \"Alright, give me a…\" Laura turned to Jenna. \"Monkey face?\" Jenna asked. They were trying to cheer me up for Sarah's sake. She hadn't let go of my arm/hand since she noticed I wasn't wearing a hat. She was convinced that I was going to pass out at any second. (AN: Remember, Gwen has an obsession with wearing hats.) I put on a fake smile and pulled my ears out while I puffed up my cheeks. \"Say cheese!\" Laura said and snapped a picture. \"Beautiful girls with a beautiful scenery of the girls' bathroom in the back,\" Jenna laughed. I took the phone and I actually smiled at it. \"Alright, so I brought you all here during free period so I won't have to repeat myself,\" Ms. Connors, our music teacher, said, \"It's that time of year, for Show-Off.\" There were cheers and the girls and I looked at each other worriedly. Show-off was where a group of three of four students got together and… showed off their talents. It was for 25% of your grade, and since this was the extra music class, only the kids who had good talent (once again I'm not trying to be vain) were in here. That included the G's. Which meant Gabe was in the room at the moment. Which meant I was trying to ignore his stares as I talked with the girls. When the bell rang I quickly walked out of the room and as I was about to head towards my locker Sarah caught my wrist and said, \"Where you going? Class is this way.\" \"I have to grab my science book,\" I said and she said, \"Okay! See you there!\" I walked down the hallway to my locker and I unlocked the door and leaned my head on the cold metal. I hadn't gotten any sleep the night before because I wasn't able to stop crying. I reached into my locker and grabbed my science textbook and stuck it in my bag. I then shut the locker door. I looked up from putting it in my bag and Gabe was standing a couple feet in front of me. I couldn't look at him. \"What do you want, Gabe?\" I simply asked. \"I-\" He was cut off by my phone ringing. It was Tara. I quickly picked it up and heard, \"THANK GOODNESS! GWEN, I'M LOCKED IN A CLOSET.\" \"What?\" I asked, shocked. \"STACY LOCKED ME IN A CLOSET!\" \"Where are you!?\" I asked her as I started walking. \"Where Audrey took us to tell us about Prom nominations! Please hurry!\" \"I'll be there as fast as I can!\" I hung up my phone and I was about to run, but a hand stopped me. It was Gabe. I didn't have time so I quickly grabbed his hand and pulled him behind me. I came just in time to see the janitor open the door and Tara ran out. Seeing me, she grabbed my hand and pulled me along. I released Gabe's hand and followed her. We made it to the auditorium in time to see Stacy kiss Gavin, and the show was over. Oh no. Gavin saw us and Tara gave him an apologetic look. He sighed and ran his hands through his hair and walked off the stage. \"Gwen!\" I heard. I turned to see the girls, \"Where have you been!? We've been looking for you everywhere! You said you were only going to be a second.\" Sarah grabbed my hand and tugged me away. \"Tara, I'll see you later!\" I yelled to her. At Slam during Show \"Okay, I had a bad day and it kinda shook me up. Made me wonder, am I doing the right thing, I mean is it worth it if we get expelled? Or if it messes things up with the guy I like, I don't know.\" Tara said, \"But I do know that there will be people out there who try and take things away from us but things bigger than prom, and we can just sit back and watch it happen. Or we can stand up for ourselves. I mean we all deserve to dance to our own playlists no matter what Moreno or anyone else has to say about it.\" \"Oh yeah, and before I forget, we both know that you guys wanna vote me for Morp queen just to find out who I am, but I don't need that crown,\" Tara said, \"But Stacey Debane she kinda does, so just keep that in mind when you vote. Now, back to the positive, we have Little Mix here. Again. Well they're always here with me but anyways, here they are with their song Change Your Life .\" (Laura, Sarah, All, Jenna , Gwen ) She captures her reflection then she throws the mirror to the floor Her image is distorted screaming, \"Is it worth it anymore?\" No-oh-oh Are you scared of the things that they might put you through?

Chapter 12- Watch It, You're Staring Gwen POV I walked into Slam alongside the girls. \"You guys didn't have to come with me. You know that, right?\" I asked them. \"Hey, we have one more Prom next year. We can go with our boyfriends then. For now, we can be the four best friends who went together.\" Jenna said looping her arms with mine and Sarah's. Sarah looped her's with Laura so we were all connected. \"Ready?\" I asked them. \"Never,\" They all chorused. I giggled and we walked in. I spotted Audrey and the twins and we all walked over. \"You all look great,\" Audrey complimented. I smiled and said, \"Thanks Audrey.\" She smiled at me and the twins continued to stare. \"You know it's unattractive to stare, right?\" Laura threw out. Audrey, the girls, and I chuckled. Tara then walked in and I couldn't help it as I clapped a little and said, \"You look gorgeous, sis.\" \"Thank you; you do too,\" Tara said. Tara pulled Audrey and I over to the side and said, \"Have you seen Gavin? I really should talk to him.\" \"Wait, what are you gonna say?\" Audrey asked. \"I don't know,\" Tara said and started panicking. \"Are we missing something?\" Larry, Barry, and the girls asked. \"Boys, girls- wait here. Conference now,\" I said and pulled Audrey and Tara backstage. Gabe POV \"I figured out how to apologize to Gwen,\" I told Garret and Greg. They nodded urging me to continue. \"I wrote a song for her,\" I said simply. \"Not a bad idea,\" Greg commented. I nodded in thanks. \"The hard part is to get her to listen to it first,\" Garret said. Greg hit him upside the head. Gwen POV \"I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out,\" Tara said as we sat down. \"Just breathe,\" Audrey said and took deep breaths showing Tara. Tara started to breathe in and out slowly before nodding to us reassuringly. \"Okay,\" Tara said. We all stood up and we were about to walk out from behind the stage when I stopped. I saw Stacey on her own looking into a small mirror saying, \"You're beautiful. You're a queen no matter what happens.\" Tara and I shared a look and then Stacy then turned around, and walked back to the party. We found the girls and the twins relatively quickly because there was a spaced area where Barry was doing… something with his legs and everyone had made a giant space around all of them. \"Good evening Seattle, you ready to find out who your Morp queen is?!\" Cami said into a mic. I stood in-between Tara and the girls. \"It's time to see who will win the crowns at Lincoln Bay High. We did have 2 nominations for Morp King but one dropped out… So that leave's Gabe LaViolet!\" Cami said and Gabe went up to get his crown. I clapped like everyone else, yet I couldn't not stare a little longer than everyone else because he looked great in his outfit. Sarah poked me and said, \"Watch it, you're staring.\" I cleared my throat, and the girls giggled as Cami said, \"Now, let's invite up the Morp court princesses up to join me on stage!\" Tara gripped my hand tightly. We had each other's backs. \"Stacy Debane!\" Stacy walked up onto the stage and Tara and I clapped a little. \"Radio Rebel!\" Everyone cheered wildly and I looked down at my heels as Tara and I didn't move. \"Radio Rebel, are you out there?\" Cami asked. Tara shook her head no slightly and Cami said, \"Well I guess we'll continue. Your Morp queen is… RADIO REBEL!\" Tara pulled me over to where Rob was. I sat down at the spot where the voice modulator and microphone controls were. Tara took a deep breath, nodded, and hugged me. I winked at Tara and pressed the vocal masking button. \"Most of you don't know me. I'm the girl who sits in the back of the class and never raises her hand. Who is so afraid of saying the wrong thing that she says nothing instead, the old me would have frozen in front of a crowd like this, but something happened and suddenly, the real stuff we were dealing with at school became more important than my fears. Look I wasn't sure I was gonna do this tonight but I need to be true to myself, so here goes.\" Tara said, and stepped out onto the stage and said, \"I'm Radio Rebel.\" I stood up and started clapping madly with the crowd and I heard Sarah let out a whistle which made me laugh. Moreno then came onto stage and the clapping stopped. She took Tara's mic, and said, \"Thank you for an enlightening evening. And now that I know who Radio Rebel is and her accomplice,\" I bit my lip, \"They are definitely getting expelled.\" Everyone gasped and Moreno said, \"Enjoy your Morp, Tara and Gwen. Oh, and don't bother coming to school on Monday.\" Then all the sudden, \"I'M RADIO REBEL!\" I looked at Audrey and smiled. \"NO, I'M A RADIO REBEL!\" Sarah and the girls yelled and I grinned. \"I'M A RADIO REBEL!\" Gavin yelled. Then everyone started yelling, \"I'M A RADIO REBEL!\" \"You can't expel everyone; can you?\" Cami asked cockily. Everyone started to chant, \"I'M RADIO REBEL!\" Moreno handed Tara her mic back and then Moreno walked off the stage. Cami handed the crown to Tara saying, \"I believe this belongs to you.\" \"Well I guess since we're all Radio Rebel, this crown belongs to all of us, so congrats kings and queens.\" Tara said. I hugged Rob and then walked over to the girls and the twins. \"But there is one person, who's been dreaming about this crown her entire life, though I'm not quite sure I heard her say she was a Radio Rebel.\" \"I'm a Radio Rebel. I'm so, Radio Rebel.\" Stacy said and I giggled. \"Well then, this belongs to you.\" They shared a private moment and then Stacy smiled again and everyone cheered. Tara was asked a lot of questions, but the nerds (not to be offensive) came to me because I did all the technological stuff. I think the most hilarious part was that the twins immediately dropped their marriage proposals. AN: You know there's only three more chapters left of the story? I might post the rest tonight if you guys want me too. Review, Follow, Favorite? Do whatever you want :) xx[Chapter 13] Summary: Tara's fraternal twin sister is Gabe's girlfriend. Gabe ends up breaking her heart- can he win her back? Gabe/OC I DO NOT OWN LITTLE MIX SONGS OR THE BAND NAME LITTLE MIX. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S. Chapter 13- It's in His DNA Gwen POV Tara had officially gotten together with Gavin (*squeal*,) and the girls and I were now backstage holding microphones. Tara was onstage and she said, \"Alright, I have a special surprise for you all tonight. My close friends, Little Mix , are here. After begging- and I mean literally begging- they finally said they'd reveal themselves and sing a couple songs for us.\" There were wild cheers. \"Now, here is… Little Mix !\" I heard Tara run off the stage and I took a deep breath. (Laura, Sarah, All, Jenna , Gwen ) Does he tell you he loves you when you least expect it? Does he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck? No scientist or biology It's obvious when he's holding me It's only natural that I'm so affected And my heart won't beat again If I can't feel him in my veins No need to question, I already know It's in his DNA D-D-D-DNA It's in his DNA And he just takes my breath away B-b-b-breath away I feel it every day, And that's what makes a man Not hard to understand Perfect in every way I see it in his face Nothing more to say It's in his D-D-D-DNA It's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future Fingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah, hey, yeah Now I don't have any first degree But I know, what he does to me No need to work it out, it's so familiar, ooh, ooh, ooh And my heart won't beat again If I can't feel him in my veins No need to question, I already know It's in his DNA D-D-D-DNA It's in his DNA And he just takes my breath away B-b-b-breath away I feel it every day, And that's what makes a man Not hard to understand Perfect in every way I see it in his face Nothing more to say It's in his D-D-D-DNA It's all about his kiss Contaminates my lips Our energy connects It's simple genetics I'm the X to his Y It's the color of his eyes He can do no wrong No, he don't need to try Made from the best He passes all the tests Got my heart beating fast It's cardiac arrest He's from a different strain That science can't explain I guess that's how he's made In his d-d-d-DNA Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, oohh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) It's in his DNA D-D-D-DNA It's in his DNA And he just takes my breath away B-b-b-breath away I feel it every day, And that's what makes a man (what makes a man) Not hard to understand (to understand) Perfect in every way (in every way) I see it in his face (in his face) Nothing more to say (nothing more to say) It's in his D-D-D-DNA The curtains started to open and I swallowed my fear. Breathe, breathe, breathe, in and out, in and out, I chanted in my head. The curtains were open and the girls and I bowed. There were wild cheers and Tara came on stage and said, \" Little Mix everybody!\" Tara pointed at all of us introducing us saying, \"Sarah, Laura, Jenna, and Gwen.\" \"How about one more song?\" Sarah asked with a grin. \"Yeah then they can know who's voice goes with who,\" Tara commented. The crowd cheered and Laura said, \"Yeah and they can see who has the best lungs here.\" They all looked at me and I said, \"Jenna can hold the high note the same time amount as me though.\" They glared and I said, \"Fine, fine.\" \"What song though?\" Jenna asked. \"… What about Madhouse?\" Tara suggested. \"Nice job, little sis,\" I said and ruffled her hair. She glared at me and I smiled at her. Tara went off stage and Jenna said, \"We're going to one more song. Maybe more. I don't know-\" \"-What she's trying to say is this song is called Madhouse. Gwen made it when she felt like she was going insane one day,\" Sarah laughed. I glared at her and said into the mic, \"I had a valid reason, I swear.\" The crowd laughed. \"Play the music, please. Before they crack anymore bad jokes,\" Laura said. I sighed and said, \"Sadly that wasn't a joke.\" (Laura, Sarah, All, Jenna , Gwen ) I feel a strange sensation taking over from my head to my toes I got the shakes body rippling it's enough to shatter my bones Is it all a dream? Cause I don't wanna stay awake But I won't remember a thing And now it's running through my veins I don't know what's happening, the beats so sick Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back Got the medicines to give me what I need Yes I'm burning up, but music is my drug Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream They're coming for me They're coming for me Everywhere I look I'm shook I got bloodshot eyes I'm like a fugitive tryna climb the walls but my hands are tied In just one touch and I'm infected by the sound crawling all over my skin And the sky is falling down, I don't know what's happening, beats so sick Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back Got the medicines to give me what I need Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream They're coming for me They're coming for me They're coming for me Oh oh Men in white coats, coats, getting so close, close Saying my prayers, don't take me back there Men in white coats, coats, getting so close, close Saying my prayers don't take me back, Take me back take me back there They're coming for me Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back (they won't take me back) Got the medicines to give me what I need Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream They're coming for me It's like I'm running but I just can't find my way (I don't wanna go back) And they can't hear my voice no matter how I scream They're coming for me AN: Seriously, this doesn't even matter about time anymore.

Gabe/OC I DO NOT OWN LITTLE MIX SONGS OR THE BAND NAME LITTLE MIX. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S. Chapter 14- Turn Your Face Gwen POV It was the next day at school and today was the Show-Off. The girls and I decided to pair up (like always) to do the class. Usually Jenna plays the piano, Sarah plays drums (no shocker there,) Laura plays bass guitar, and I play guitar. Today we were going to sing. \"Nervous?\" Laura asked as we sat in the auditorium with the rest of the classes including the G's. I shook my head and said, \"I would've been before, but not anymore.\" \"Good,\" Laura said. Jenna and Sarah ran in and sat down a second before the bell rang. They looked really excited. \"You okay?\" I asked them. Sarah was about to say something but Jenna slapped a hand over her mouth. \"We're fine,\" Jenna said. I then noticed Garret and Greg walk in. I cleared my throat while crossing my legs, and said, \"I don't even want to know now.\" The acts went by quickly until it was our turn. I was now nervous as crap. As we were behind the curtain watching a girl play the piano (quite expertly, might I add) I looked at Laura and said, \"I take back what I said. I am nervous as fuck.\" Laura laughed at me. Sarah was still bouncing and Jenna was talking to the sound guy. \"Alright, next we have Gwen, Laura, Sarah, and Jenna,\" Ms. Connors said. I sat down on one of the stools and Laura, Sarah, and myself were seated but Jenna ran on stage about a second after and said, \"Sorry. Had to fix something.\" The crowd laughed and Ms. Connors said, \"Whenever you're ready girls.\" (Laura, Sarah, All, Jenna , Gwen ) In my memory, all the small things, like daggers in my mind In my memory, while my head bleeds, the words I'll never find That I always meant to say to you I can't Cause you turned your face, and now I can't feel you anymore Turn your face, so now I can't see you anymore Walk away until you're not standing at my door Turn your face, walk away and stay Turn your face, hmm oh In my memory, I was hurting, long before we met, oh In my memory, there's still burning, fingerprints you left And I'll always meant to say to you I can't So just turn your face, until I can't see you anymore Turn your face, until I can't see you anymore Walk away until you're not standing at my door Turn your face, walk away and stay Turn your face Each time I take you back You bring one thousand cracks And I accept them, like a fool oh So now what's your excuse What do we have to lose Since I'm already losing you So hard to face, that I can't feel you anymore Hard to face, that I can't see you anymore So walk away, until you're not standing at my door Turn your face, walk away, and stay Turn your face Turn your face, and stay Turn your face I stared at the ground the whole song and I still stared at the ground when there was loud clapping. The girls and I left the stage and then quickly sat back down. \"Next is Gabe, Greg, Gavin, and Garret,\" Ms. Connors said. They came on stage and they sang one of their songs. The bell rang after that and I quickly gathered my stuff and I headed into the hallway. I was in the cafeteria with the girls when all the sudden music started blaring out of the speakers. Since we were all outside I was able to see that it was Cami, but there was some other people there too that I couldn't see. I looked closely and saw that it was the G's, Cami, and Tara. What the… Everyone including the girls and I walked over. Tara saw me and turned back around and whispered frantically to Gavin. Gavin whispered to Gabe who started the intro to a song. It was only Gabe who played though. Garret, Gavin, and Greg stood to the side. Wha- wha- what did she say Mmmm whatcha say, Mmm that you only meant well? Well of course you did Mmmm whatcha say, Mmmm that it's all for the best?

Review, Follow, Favorite? Do whatever you want :) xx[Chapter 15] Summary: Tara's fraternal twin sister is Gabe's girlfriend. Gabe ends up breaking her heart- can he win her back? Gabe/OC I DO NOT OWN LITTLE MIX SONGS OR THE BAND NAME LITTLE MIX. I ONLY OWN MY OC'S. Chapter 15- Epilogue Gwen POV I was in the Gabe's car on the passenger's side. The radio was blaring as the top was down. I smiled as I felt the sun hit my face and then grinned wider as I saw the sun hit my ring causing sparkles to go everywhere. I then looked down at my engagement ring. I was twenty-two now and I was happily engaged to my boyfriend of seven years, Gabe LaViolet. Gabe went to college over in England and to work on he and the G's album since they needed lyrical help. They had only written about ten songs and since they wanted to make a good full album they needed a couple more, so Gabe volunteered to go over to England to work with the company that signed them. The girls and I also got signed, but we just had to record the album because the girls were dead set on using my songs. Tara still does the show and I visit frequently so you'll hear me on it; she and Gavin are still going strong. I think the funny thing is that since I decided to stay with Gabe so we could keep our relationship going, I had developed quite the English accent as the rest of the girls did. Gabe however, didn't get an accent. Whenever we went out on a date and got stopped by fans, I talked with them for a few minutes and they always ask me, \"So you're originally from England?\" I always tell them no and say, \"No, I'm actually American. I just spent so much time in England with people who have accents that I retained it.\" \"Hey, you okay?\" Gabe asked me. I turned to look at him and said, \"I'm just thinking.\" \"About what?\" \"Us, life, the bands,\" I said. Gabe took his hand off my knee, and I slid my hand in his, intertwining our fingers. As we stopped at a stoplight, he leaned over and kissed me. I smiled and leaned my head against his shoulder. Soon the light changed and he continued driving. We were currently in LA. I was recording a new song with the girls and going to see Tara and my parents at the same time. I was also going to be looking for a wedding dress, but what Gabe doesn't know won't hurt him. Gabe pulled into the Slam parking lot and we both got out. As I walked around the side of the car, Gabe held his hand out for me and I quickly grabbed onto it and he pulled me close to him. As we walked towards the entrance, paparazzi came out of nowhere and Gabe pulled me behind him. I placed my other hand on his wrist right on the tattoo he had that said my name. I told him not to get it but of course he didn't listen to me and still got it. I now adore it. Gabe opened the door to the Slam for me, and I walked in first and he walked in behind me. He quickly took hold of my hand again, and I walked down the familiar hallways to get to Tara's room. The show didn't start for ten minutes, so I could scare Tara if I wanted to. I quickly opened the door to the room and Tara and Cami screamed. I cracked up. \"Oh, that was priceless! You should've seen your faces!\" I laughed harder. Once I regained my bearings I ran over to Tara and hugged her tightly. \"How are you!?\" I asked her, \"I missed you so much!\" \"I'm fine, I missed you too, and you sound so elegant with your accent,\" Tara commented with a laugh. I whacked her on the shoulder and said, \"Shut up.\" \"Hey, will you sit in on the show with me?\" Tara asked excitedly. I smiled and said, \"I kinda already figured I was…\" Tara rolled her eyes. \"So I have a very special guest today, Gwen Adams, also known as ¼ of Little Mix!\" Tara said. I simply leaned forwards and said, \"That was such a big introduction when people are probably used to hearing me by now-\" \"-You come once every two months, not every day,\" Tara said. I scoffed and said, \"Not once every two months. It's once every three months.\" Tara rolled her eyes and said, \"Anyways, I've never told anyone but Gwen is my fraternal twin sister. She actually helped me with the show in the very beginning.\" \"This show is my baby,\" I said with a sniffle as I patted the computer. \"Gwen, why don't we take some calls?\" Tara suggested. I shrugged and said, \"Sure. Let's do it.\" I pressed the button and Tara said, \"You are on with Radio Rebel and Gwen Adams.\" The girl on the phone was practically sobbing as she said, \"Gwen I am such a big Mixer, I was so happy to hear that you were in Seattle.\" I smiled and said, \"Thank you sweetie, but please don't cry.\" About four more calls of sobbing girls we finally were able to get a call where someone wasn't sobbing. \"Gwen are you really getting married to Gabe from The G's or is it just a promise ring?\" The woman asked. I knew this question was coming. All the press knew was that I had a ring on my finger. They didn't know anything else. \"Yes,\" I confirmed. The woman quickly hung up and Tara said, \"We'll take a few more calls in a few. For now, this is one of my favorites.\" Tara played Stereo Soldier and I leaned back in my seat. Gabe who was sitting behind me on the couch, wrapped his arms around my shoulders. I leaned back against him. Gabe and I had been engaged for over seven months. We had both managed to dodge the questions trying to keep it quiet for as long as possible. But with social media, paparazzi, fans, it was getting harder and harder to talk around. Last night Gabe and I had decided if anyone asked that we would just confirm it. We'd answer the questions as they came. Gabe's hand was laced with mine as we walked out of the dress shop. Two bodyguards were around us, and I was holding his jacket as he was holding my giant bag that held my wedding dress. Yeah, I brought him with me dress shopping. I needed his opinion. Plus if you think about it, it doesn't really matter because my makeup and hair weren't done correctly and I didn't have the correct accessories or shoes. As the fans and paparazzi got thicker, more guards showed up and Gabe pulled me closer to him. It was kind of ridiculous how many people showed up. Gabe opened the car door for me and I got in as a bodyguard put the dress in the back for me. Gabe got in the driver's seat and started driving. Our hands stayed interlocked the whole time he was driving. We soon made it to the studio and I saw Garret, Gavin, and Greg's cars out front. I smiled knowing the girls were here too. When Gabe parked, I hoped out quickly, and ran into the building. Gabe quickly followed after me. I went into the elevator and Gabe got in just in time for the door to shut. He trapped me in his arms and I laughed as he attacked my face with his lips kissing me everywhere. When the door opened on the right floor, I ran out laughing and Gabe followed me. We made it to the recording room and I stopped suddenly when I saw the girls upside down and all over the couches with the rest of the G's around the room with popcorn in their hands and throwing it at each other. Gabe wrapped his arms around my waist, stopping behind me, and we both just kind of stared at the two bands. \"Are we recording, or are we having a popcorn fight?\" I asked and everyone looked up. \"GWEN!\" The guys yelled and tackled me which meant they tackled Gabe too. I made a small squeak and said, \"Help.\" The guys got up, and Gavin helped me up and Gabe wrapped an arm around my shoulders and I said, \"Where's Tar-Bear?\" I was talking about Tara and they all knew it. Said girl then proceeded to walk in with the producer. Tara smiled at me and the producer said, \"Alright, let's get this single done.\" The girls got up and high-tailed it in the booth and I followed after them. This was probably going to be one of my favorites because this was a song that the girls and I wrote together.

Because were one of you\" the other girl said over the small mic \"So we had our report cards today, and both me and my partener got minus's, I mean you can't give us minus's just for who we are...\" she said \"So since grades are being handed out we think that all of us at Lincoln Bay High should get an F for labeling each other, jocks, outcasts, dorks, queen B's and their fellow pops. And of course, new born pops\" Green eyes said over her own mic \"See these are all labels, not who we really are, once upon a time being different was a good thing, now those differences just divide us, you deserve to embrace your awesomness, stand up for who you are, reject the status quo. We dare you\" the other girl said... The Next Day At Lincoln Bay High... \"Okay last night the Radio Rebels...\" Audrey started \"Were awesome?\" Cleo asked tilting her head slightly \"...As usual, reject the status quo is my new life motto, their both so inspiring, so...theirself\" Audrey said before sticking the red lollipop back in her mouth \"I wish I could be more like them\" Tara said looking off to the side \"You should talk to your step-dad\" Audrey suggested \"What? Why?\" Tara asked \"Uh he runs Slam FM the biggest radio station in Seattle...\" Audrey said in a duh tone, Cleo rolled her eyes \"...Maybe he could get you girls an internship, that would be a big confidence booster for you \"Are you kidding me? He's been married to our mom for like two months, and he probably thinks I'm a total step-freak\" Tara said sighing \"I freak out whenever he asks what kind of cereal I want\" she added, the three girls started down the hallway \"I just wish I could talk to everyone the way I talk to you two\" she said \"Guess that's why were your BFF's, well I'm your sister but still\" Cleo said \"BFFTLEWE\" Audrey corrected, the other two girls gave her a confused look \"Best friends for totally like ever without exception\" she explained, they both nodded \"Catchy\" Cleo said repeating the line in her head \"You should try my relaxation technique, when I'm memorizing lines for drama I imagine that I'm breathing in the words\" Audrey said, Tara stopped walking and faced her friend \"Audrey what does that even mean?\" she asked confused, Audrey cleared her throat before taking a deep breath \"You need to breath your words\" she said while breathing out so that she sounded as though she was going to pass out, Cleo laughed in amusement \"You even breath at a time like this\" Barry said pushing the girls forward \"Problem Barry?\" Cleo asked as they started walking again \"Last night the Radio Rebels revealed the biggest clue of their identity's, they go to our school\" he said in awe \"She mentioned it and then at 14:30 on Tuesdays Podcast\" Larry added, they walked into the lift \"Wow obsessed much Larry?\" Audrey asked \"Obsessed? Please I would hardly describe myself as obsessive\" he exclaimed, he pulled out a wet-wipe from his shirt pocket and cleaned the lift button before pushing it, they all gave him a disbelieving look \"What? It's flu season\" he said defensively, Cleo rolled her eyes as the lift doors shut. The doors opened and to the girls annoyence both boys were still talking about The Radio Rebels \"So exciting, someone on radio who's actually one of us\" Larry exclaimed as they exited the lift \"Oh it could be those girls...no those two...or those two\" Barry said pointing at random girls \"No those girls are too tall, The Radio Rebel's voices sound about 5'6 to me and while one has red hair the other had brown\" Larry said, Cleo once again rolled her eyes while Audrey and Tara watched the boys bicker \"Like Tara's or Cleo's\" he said \"No way they are nothing like Tara and Cleo\" Barry said \"Hey\" Cleo exclaimed as they stopped walking \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Tara asked \"Oh girls we deffinatly love you but your nothing like the Radio Rebels who are blonde and black haired\" Barry said turning to Larry \"And you know this how?\" Larry asked \"The Radio Rebels are my soulmates, I too got a minus in participation\" Barry replied \"How can that be you never shut up\" Larry said \"Exactly\" Barry replied as though it was obvious, Cleo sighed and noticed her twin sister staring at something, she turned around to see one of the youngers boys accidentaly drive his small remote control car in front of Stacy, the school Queen B's, feet and she kicked it away before walking on with her posse, Cleo sighed and turned back to the others who were watching Stacy speak rather meanly to her friend \"How are we supposed to reject the status quo when the status quo is...well status quo\" Tara said \"It's like what the Radio Rebels said, just be ourselves\" Audrey said rather confidentaly before, to the horror of Cleo, heading over to Stacy \"Hi Stacy how's it going?\" Audrey asked standing to Stacey's left \"See this is what I'm talking about, everybody thinks they can just talk to us because of that eternally lame radio babble\" Stacy said \"We thinks she protest too much\" Barry said \"Yeah we thinks...wait what do we thinks?\" Larry asked in confusion \"That she's one of the Radio Rebels\" Barry said \"Please like I would ever encourage people like you to talk to us\" Stacy said motioning to her and her friend who was being very quiet \"Ah ha, so you admit you listen to her\" Larry exclaimed, Stacy scoffed and began texting again \"This one's staring at me\" her friend said turning to Barry who was staring at her intently \"Please don't stand do close to us\" Stacy said in disgust \"You and I aren't any different, like the Radio Rebels said...\" Audrey was cut off when Stacy put up her finger signalling Audrey to be quiet \"No words, you don't think were different? Watch and learn, principal Marino...\" Stacy said looking behind us, the principal soon popped up inbetween me and Audrey \"Is everything alright here?\" she asked \"Actually no, Audrey was trying to get me to listen to some pod cast in class, but of course I said no\" Stacy lied, I gaped \"What?\" Audrey asked in disbelief \"You know that there's an anti-distraction policy, let me see your bag\" the principal said, Audrey huffed and handed the principal her small bag \"But I wasn't even listening to it\" she said \"Well now you can't can you\" the principal said in a voice to mock Audrey \"You too young lady's\" The principal said holding out her hand to me and Tara, we passed them over without any hesitation \"Thank you for bringing this to my attention Stacy\" she said before walking away \"Get it now? Your little Dj hero's don't know what their talking about\" Stacy said, I noticed Tara struggling to say something but her shyness prevented her from it \"Oh I'm sorry, does her royal shyness wanna say something?\" Stacy asked with attitude, Tara tried really hard to say something but she couldn't \"I thought not\" Stacy said before walking off followed by her little friend, Cleo sighed again and turned to her sister \"You okay?\" she asked in concern, Tara nodded \"Yeah I'm good\" she said, Cleo knew it was the opposite but she didn't press the matter any further.[Chapter 2] Cleo was sat in the seat to Tara's left doodling on her notepad \"Alright everybody today we are going to be working on a project with Mr Sol's Drama class\" the teacher announced, the other class walked in and Tara and Cleo were greeted by Audrey \"This is so exciting\" she exclaimed quietly to the girls before occupying the seat in front of Tara \"Wonder what kind of project we could be doing\" Cleo said in thought, she suddenly noticed her sister gazing at something else and she turned her head to see Gavin, Tara suddenly jumped up and sped-walked out of the class room, Audrey and Cleo both followed her \"What is Gavin doing here?\" she asked nervously \"Uh he's in Drama, yah know you could talk to him I mean you've had a crush on him since the first Harry Potter movie\" Audrey said, Tara glanced at him through the small class window \"No no no, he is a newborn pop okay totally wrong social racket, the best thing for me is to just avoid him all together\" Tara said turning back to the girls \"Gavin's not a leadist like that, ask yourself, what would The Radio Rebels do?\" Audrey asked, she walked back into the class and Cleo turned to her sister \"It's okay Tar', try not to be nervous alright?\" she asked placing a hand on her sister's shoulder, Tara nodded and they both went back to their seats \"...Who would like to suggest a scene from the book...\" the teacher stopped talking once she noticed Audrey already up and writing on the board, Cleo chuckled quietly \"Oh, did you uh wanna pick a volunteer?\" Audrey asked noticing the stares she was getting from the teacher \"I got excited\" she added, everyone chuckled \"Okay who wants to write a suggestion? C'mon hands people\" Audrey said, a few people raised their hands and the teacher looked around the class for a moment \"Tara, how about you? C'mon up\" The teacher said, Cleo looked at her sister nervously, Tara walked over to the board quietly while making sure to keep her head down, she pulled off the pen cap before aiming it at the board, Cleo leaned forward in her seat watching intently and noticing her sister freeze up \"C'mon Tara\" she whispered to herself, Tara turned around to face the class and everything went in slow motion for her, she walked forward accidentaly bumping into Stacy's table \"Hello, walk much?\" Stacy asked with a tone, Tara bent down to pick up the book but bumped her head on the way back up, while everyone laughed Cleo and Audrey watched in sympathy as Tara ran back to her seat and burried her head in her arms out of humiliation. Later On... While Tara was talking to her Step-father after school Cleo was on her way home, rather fast \"Damn it\" she exclaimed bursting through the door \"Hey sweetie what took you so long?\" her mom asked \"I had things to help out with in school is Tara home?\" she asked dumping her bag on the side \"Yeah she's upstairs sweetie\" her mom replied, Cleo kicked off her heels before running upstairs and rushing through her bedroom door \"Tara I'm so sorry I'm late I got caught up but don't worry it's not too late for me to help out with the station\" she said unaware that her step-father was there \"Oh crud Rob watcha doin' in here?\" she squeaked after noticing he was sat down \"You girls are The Radio Rebels?\" he stated more than asked, Cleo's eyes widened and she turned to Tara \"That depends are we in trouble?\" Tara asked nervously \"No of course not I just, I don't understand how you girls are doing that I mean your both so shy\" Rob said in confusion, Tara sighed and sat at the computer before putting on her headphones and mic \"We are, but she's not. I dunno it just works\" Tara replied smiling a little \"I'm actually not that shy, I just can't stick up for myself, or anyone else if it actually comes down to it\" Cleo said quietly \"I love it, I mean I can't believe it but I love it were gonna take Slam FM to the next level\" Rob said excitedly \"Say what now?\" Cleo asked nervously \"Yeah you girls are gonna be Slam FM's next big thing\" he replied \"You girls are hired, that's for sure your hired\" Rob said before walking out, Tara looked down at her sister who looked as though she was about to faint, their mom suddenly ran in with something covering her face \"Oh I just happened to be ease dropping I hope you don't mind, OMG my baby's are gonna take Slam FM to the next level\" she squealed, she hugged both girls who were still wide eyed \"What's the matter?\" their mom asked \"What if I mess it up?\" Tara asked, Cleo sighed \"Oh girls you have to take risks, because I always thought shartruse was a bad color for me and then I tried it and now it's my trademark. How do you know something isn't Faboo if you don't try it right?\" their mom asked before embracing Tara again.[Chapter 3] \"Look out, your in the 12 night group with Stacy and Gavin\" Audrey said staring at the whiteboard, Cleo quickly checked for her name and she sighed in relief to find that she was with Audrey and Ben \"No no no, I can't\" Tara said nervously \"Talk to him, he's just a person\" Audrey said \"It'll be okay sis just take a deep breath\" Cleo said reasuringly, Tara nodded before walking over to Gavin with her down \"You think she'll be okay?\" Cleo asked Audrey \"I hope so\" she replied as they both walked to their table. Gym Class... \"Of course he's taking Stacy to prom\" Tara said dissapointedly \"Hey at least you talked to him\" Cleo said \"Yeah I mean for you that's major progress\" Audrey added \"I barely got two words out\" Tara said sighing \"Don't worry Tara, if anything I'm sure both me and Audrey would panick if we were talking to the guys we like\" Cleo said trying to make her sister's situation seem normal, which to Cleo it was \"Why who do you like?\" Audrey asked, they all stopped walking eager to see what Cleo's answer would be \"I don't wanna say\" she said, Tara gave her a look \"C'mon Cle' you can tell us\" she said, Cleo sighed \"Alright, this is gonna seem so ironic but. He's in the band with your crush Tara\" Cleo said quetly \"What? Which one?\" Tara asked eagerly, Cleo looked to her right where the boy himself was playing soccer with the other boys \"Oh you have got to be kidding me\" Audrey said noticing which boy it was \"Look I can't help it, he's just so charming sometimes\" Cleo said \"Who are we looking at?\" Tara asked trying to see which boy the girls had their eye on \"Your sisters crushing on Gabe, the main singer of the G's\" Audrey said as though it was a bad thing \"Is there a problem with that?\" Tara asked not seeing it \"He's a huge douche for one thing and all he cares about is being famous, total jerk. Besides for all we know he could be trying to hook up with Cleo just because her new dad runs Slam FM\" Audrey said in thought, Cleo sighed knowing it was most probably true \"Yeah I guess your right\" she said dissapointedly \"Look why don't you girls come over my house tonight? I'll teach you my hyena pose and we'll listen to The Radio Rebels\" Audrey said \"Actually we can't Audrey\" Cleo said \"What do you mean? It's The Radio Rebels first show on Slam FM do you realize how epic that is? I mean she was popular before but now it's like the whole world will be listening including us\" Audrey said, Cleo's eyes widened for a second and she gave Tara a panicked look \"We have plans\" Tara said, Cleo looked around the playing field at all of the kids she knew would be listening to her and Tara's show and it made her want to faint \"What kind of plans?\" Audrey asked \"Family plans\" Tara replied \"You are such a bad liar you look just like you did when you said you liked that new haircut I got at the mall\" Audrey said, Cleo took a few deep breaths before tuning in to what her friend and sister were talking about \"It wasn't that bad\" Tara lied \"It was horrible\" Audrey corrected, she stopped suddenly and turned to the girls \"Tell me what your doing or I'll star screaming in three seconds\" she said \"What?\" Cleo asked nervously \"1...2..\" Audrey counted down before screaming really loud, both girls covered her mouth before she grabbed anyone's attention \"Well?\" she asked expectantly after they removed their hands, Tara looked around for a minute and Cleo desperatley wanted to tell Audrey, but she knew they both couldn't \"I'm sorry, we can't tell you\" Tara said sadly \"I thought I was your BFFTLE\" Audrey said in a hurt tone \"Without exception\" Cleo said \"Then why don't you girls trust me?\" Audrey asked, Tara sighed in frustration before walking off and Cleo played with her hands \"Audrey believe me we really want to tell you but we can't, it's like a family secret\" she said trying to make her best friend understand \"Look you girls can tell me anything you know that right?\" Audrey asked, Cleo was about to reply before Audrey cut her off \"No don't say anything, I'm so mad at you girls right now. But before I leave let me tell you this, your crush is checking you out, good luck with that\" Audrey snapped before storming off, Cleo threw her hands up in frustration and looked behind her to see Gabe was infact checking her out, she gave him a small smile before running off to find Tara. At Lunch... Cleo was sat at the lunch table with Tara, Barry, Larry and Audrey who had been blanking both her and Tara since gym class \"Oh no, Gavin 3:00\" Tara exclaimed quietly but loud enough for her friends to hear \"Your 3:00 or my 3:00?\" Barry asked looking around \"You guys have the same 3:00\" Cleo whispered in amusement \"Oh god he's coming over here what do I do?\" Tara asked panicking, Audrey groaned and spun around \"For the record this is why you don't ice your friends out, talk to him\" she said quickly before turning back around \"Hey Tara what's up?\" Gavin asked leaning agains't the table, Cleo glanced at Tara who wasn't able to speak \"So uh d'you wanna run lines on the weekend?\" he asked, Tara was miming things but not actually saying them \"Or we could mime the lines if your not feeling particulary talky\" he offered, Cleo wanted badly to laugh but she kept it in \"Mime...talky...uh...me...going...now\" Tara said getting out of her seat and speed walking away \"Um okay\" Gavin said confused before going back to his own table \"Damn it. Tara!\" Cleo called as her and Audrey chased her.[Chapter 4] Cleo was sat with Tara and Rob at the Slam FM centre waiting for him to show them where they would be \"I want The Radio Rebels add's in every social network just blast the internet, updates every hour we wanna blanket the market, good alright bye\" Rob said, during that sentence both Tara's and Cleo's eyes had gone wide \"So I was talking to your mom about keeping the whole Radio Rebels thing on the QT and I think it's a good idea, you know I don't want you to talk to anybody about it, Radio Rebels is the shot in the arm that Slam FM needs, since the last show producer Snazzy Dog crashed and burnt we've got a lot hinging on this, inculding my job no pressure okay?\" Rob asked as they walked, the weight of it all finally came down on Cleo and she started to panick, her hands started to shake and she felt really thirsty \"So your shows gonna run 7pm Mondays to Fridays because that was the time you girls would blast from your room, and you'll be taking over from Dj Fluffy Mac who is now moving to Sunday night, right so let's show you the booth\" Rob said turning around, he stayed quiet when he noticed that neither girls were there. After hearing enough to make them panick both girls had run into the break room \"Hey Tara, Cleo you girls remember me? I'm Tammi Q we met at the Slam christmas party\" the girl said filling her mug \"Girls, when Rob told me you two were The Radio Rebels, this was my face...\" Tammi said giving them a strange disbelieving look, Cleo took a deep breath while Tara looked horrified \"Cuz I thought you were both just these little shy things, but you are all kinds of amazing, you are fierce, I just can't wait to see what you got going for the...\" Tammi stopped talking once she noticed Tara had gone missing, Cleo slowly pulled herself away from the door and stood next to Tara, only within Tammi's view \"Tara, are you okay?\" she asked \"I can't even speak to Gavin without freezing, how am I supposed to speak to all of Seattle?\" Tara asked nervously, Cleo sighed and leaned agains't the vending machine \"It's no different than recording in your bedroom\" Tammi said \"In our bedroom we can pretend that no one's listening but now we know everyone's listening and Rob's putting all this pressure on it and mom's wants us to have our Shartruse moment I mean I don't even like Shartruse I don't even know what it is\" Tara said quickly, Cleo chuckled and so did Tammi \"Tara come out where I can see you\" Tammi said \"It's okay Tara\" Cleo said moving out of the way, Tara poked her head out from behind the machine \"Look girls everybody gets nervous, it's totally normal. Just consider me as your best friend here at Slam FM, just catch your breath and then we'll walk out together\" Tammi said, Tara glanced back nervously at the door and Cleo sighed \"Look sis, I'm as nervous as you right now, but this is the best thing ever Tara, what we've always wanted is to be heard right? Well now everyone's waiting to listen, and I'll be there with you every step of the way just like I always have been. C'mon sis\" Cleo said holding out her hand, Tara glanced down at her hand before taking it. Tammi led the girls to the recording booth and their eyes widened in awe \"Oh my god\" Cleo exclaimed walking further into the room \"Is this whole room for us?\" Tara asked in shock \"We call this the live room cuz when that red light is on, your live\" Tammi said sitting in one of the swirly chairs, Cleo spun around slowly to look at everything \"If you girls wanna move around then use these headsets so we don't miss anything\" Tammi said motioning to the two black headsets on the table \"There's your vocal masking button but you girls already know about that\" she said \"And the song selections are up to you\" she finished, she got out of the chair and motioned the girls to sit in them, Cleo sat down in front of the computer and Tara sat right next to her \"My god, there's like 20,000 songs on here\" Cleo said scrolling down through them all \"We got some times before you go on if you wanna practice, yah know get comfortable\" Tammi said putting the main mic in front of them \"Practice, okay maybe I should play a song just to get the hang of it\" Tara said, she clicked on a song and panicked when a faster chipmunk version played \"Okay that was bad practice\" she said jumping out of the chair, Cleo stopped the chipmunk song and sighed \"Don't worry about it, you girls will be fine. And I'm right next door if you need me, just pretend it's your bedroom\" Tammi said, she walked into the other room and picked up her own headset \"Your on in 15...\" as she started counting down Tara closed the window shutters so no one could see her or Cleo \"Oh my god\" Cleo said panicking for a split second, Tara sat down on the opposite side and took a deep breath \"Your listening to Slam FM and this is The Radio Rebels show\" the man on the radio said \"These are your Radio Rebels live from Slam FM\" Tara said, Cleo giggled quietly and pulled her own mic down \"You know it, listen guys we gotta confess, moving the show from the bedroom to Slam FM studios was so scary, but hey life's all about change right?\" Cleo said into the mic \"Maybe some people just wanna label you as one thing, analyze you then walk away, we don't have to let that stop us from becoming who we wanna be, like that kid with the remote control car...\" Tara started \"Yeah I mean maybe he's gonna grow up to invent an entire green rocket ship, or that girl who gives everyone carnations on valentines day just so no one feels left out, she could grow up to be president...\" Cleo added \"Guys if we just drop the labels and clicks and just be ourself, we have no idea what were capable of. Look if your all with us on this, then wear red tomorrow, it'll be like saying despite our differences, were in this together. This song is from red letter day\" Tara said clicking on the song, the song started to play and both girls moved away from the mic a bit \"Hey Tara\" Cleo said, Tara smiled and looked at her sister \"I like red\" she said randomly while shrugging, Tara started to laugh and her sister soon joined her. Next Day At School... Cleo and Tara walked down the hallway in their own clothes which deffinatley had red in them and looked around in awe, they were both surprised at how many people took their advice \"Ahem\" Audrey said catching up to both girls \"I thought you had freakishly good vision\" Cleo said noticing that Audrey had red glasses on \"Fashion shouldn't be functional\" Audrey said showing the girls that the glasses didn't have lenses \"Do you girls know why I chose red rims? I assume you both do because of your red clothes\" she said, Tara looked around \"I can't believe all these people are wearing red just because the Radio Rebels said to\" she said in surprise \"So you girls did listen to Radio Rebels last night? What happend to your mystery plans?\" Audrey asked, Tara was about to reply when the lift opened revealing Barry and Larry in identical outfits \"Can you guys tell us apart?\" They asked in sync \"You guys are fraternal not identical\" Audrey said before storming into the lift, Tara and Cleo joined them. The lift doors opened and they all walked out \"We just ran a recording of the Radio Rebels show through a voice analysis app, were closer than ever to revealing their true identities\" Barry said \"Local twins crack the Radio Rebels ID's\" Larry said with a dreamy look on his face \"See then I'll be able to proffess my undying love\" Barry said \"We'll be famous, we could get a reward, or at least out own reality T.V show\" Larry said \"Where she and I could be married on live T.V, either one of them I don't mind\" Barry said dreamily, Cleo rolled her eyes \"Girls since your step-dad runs Slam FM maybe you could help us out\" the boys said turning to them \"Actually were not allowed to go to Slam FM when the Radio Rebels girls are there, to keep the mystery mysterious\" Tara said quietly \"The truth is, Cleo and Tara don't have time for friend related things\" Audrey said before once again storming the other way \"Excuse us for a minute\" Cleo said to the boys before she and Tara caught up with Audrey \"Audrey, Audrey, AUDREY!\" Tara said louder \"What?\" she asked spinning around, Tara tried to say something but she couldn't find the words \"Forget it I'm leaving\" Audrey said about to start walking again, Cleo and Tara stopped her and Tara closed a classroom door so no one would listen \"I am about to tell you something so top secret but you cannot tell anyone\" Tara said, Cleo's eyes widened a little \"Tara she's my best friend too but are you sure?\" she asked nervously \"Look I won't tell anyone I swear, you can say it\" Audrey said reasuringly, Cleo sighed but agreed to tell her, Tara mumbled it and Cleo rolled her eyes \"Tara you need to breath your words\" Audrey said, Tara mumbled it again \"Louder c'mon, breath the words\" Audrey said \"We're Radio Rebels\" Cleo said quietly but loud enough for Audrey to hear \"Oh...I don't believe you\" she said, Cleo rolled her eyes. After School... \"If your like us and believe music can change the world one track at a time, your gonna love this track one of my new favoruite bands\" Tara said over the mic, Audrey had a headset and she had a shocked look \"Oh my gosh I can't believe their you and your them, I mean your the last people I would expect to be the Radio Rebels\" she said \"It's been driving us crazy not telling you, and of course we wanna hang out but we've been doing the show\" Cleo explained quiet relieved she had told someone \"Here's the thing though you can't tell anyone not even Larry and Barry because Slam wants to keep it a big secret and so do we\" Tara said motioning to her and Cleo, Audrey started to squeal and she pulled both laughing girls into a large group hug.[Chapter 5] Cleo was walking past the auditorium with Audrey when they both noticed Stacy, Tara and Gavin inside \"Think we should wait for her?\" Audrey asked as they hid behind the door carefull not to interrupt \"Yeah, that would probably be best, I wonder how their groups doing anyway\" Cleo said in thought \"Wait Tara did you wanna say something?\" Gavin asked, Audrey and Cleo watched intently \"No she's fine, action\" Stacy said impatiently \"Cut. Tara you listen to the Radio Rebels right?\" Gavin asked her, she nodded \"You were wearing red yesterday so I figured. The Rebels are right, lifes about taking risks and making changes, so go ahead, say what you feel\" Gavin said, Tara turned to Stacy who crossed her arms smuggly as though she knew the answer, Cleo and Audrey were both watching from the entrance with their hands linked together as though waiting for something \"It's just that the scene was about us falling for each other, even though we don't know it and...\" Tara started \"Blocking like this feels weird right?\" Gavin asked walking towards her \"Right exactly, the audience is supposed to get what were feeling without us saying anything and it only works if were closer\" Tara said, Cleo and Audrey turned to each other and cheered quietly before hugging in celebration that Tara had spoken to someone other than them \"She did it\" Cleo whispered, Audrey nodded and they both turned back to the scene \"Okay, we clearly need extra rehersal, my place tonight at 7:00\" Stacy said \"Oh...I uh can't tonight, Wednesdays mandatory family dinner, like my family dinner\" Tara said \"Fine, whatever lunch tomorrow, everybody's a director now\" Stacy said before storming out, as soon as Gavin had left too Cleo and Audrey ran into the auditorium cheering \"You did it\" Cleo exclaimed hugging Tara, Tara laughed and hugged her back \"It was so scary, but I somehow did it\" she said smiling, Cleo chuckled and took a look at the CD Tara had \"The G's Demo\" she read out in confusion \"It was Gavin's, he dropped it and I just picked it up\" Tara said \"We should listen to it, I mean you girls have some time before the show right?\" Audrey asked, Tara nodded and Cleo pulled out her CD player \"Why wait till later?\" she asked smirking, Audrey chuckled and they put the CD into the player. Later On At Slam FM \"You peple at Lincoln Bay High totally rocked the red yesterday, I noticed one of you guys wearing red specs yesterday that were the epitemy of cool\" Cleo said before once again sucking on the yellow lollipop \"But can we talk about what's not cool for a second? How the school keeps confiscating our stuff, I mean I've lost two sets of headphones and an MP3 player just this term alone\" Tara said putting on the headset to walk around the room \"And I've lost my CD player I mean that thing meant the world to me, but this isn't just about us, we also noticed that some people are an exception to the stuff snatching academic, it's funny how that works huh?\" Cleo asked leaning forward on the desk \"She's right, you guys it's not just our Playlists and Players were being deprived of yah know? Music is the soundtrack to our lives its where we've been and where were going and everywhere inbetween. Our music is who we are and are we gonna let someone just snatch that away from us? Or are we gonna change the game?\" Tara asked walking back over to the desk \"So here's a new song about trying things you never thought you could, look I've been tryna do a bunch of new things lately and this song severely inspires me\" she said, Cleo noticed the song come up on her touch screen and she nodded at Tara \"Now we know one of you may know this song already, but we want you guys who haven't to vibe it, dig on it and then remember that feeling. So tomorrow we want all you guys at 8:00 am to get up and dance, just let yourself out and go wild...\" Cleo said clicking on the song \"This is 'Turn it all around' by the G's\" Tara finished, the song started to play and both Cleo and Tara danced in their seats.[Chapter 6] The Next Day - 8:00 am Everyone in school were dancing apart from a few randoms that weren't very fond of the Radio Rebels, Tara was sat down while everyone in her class danced, Audrey and Cleo were dancing together and laughing at the same time, the girls noticed a dancing Gavin looking at Tara \"Time to take your own advice\" Audrey said to Tara, Tara noticed too and Cleo pulled her out of the chair, at first Tara was dancing with Cleo and Audrey but then her and Gavin were making their way towards each other, to Cleo's annoyence Stacy jumped in front of Gavin and started dancing with him instead, neither Tara or Gavin cared they just danced while occasionally glancing at each other, all of the music suddenly stopped and so did the dancing \"This is a place of learning not dancing and anyone listening to Radio Rebels during school will be suspended, and Radio Rebels I advise you to turn yourselves in now or your futures will be Radio Silence\" the principal said over the speaker, everyone sat down and Tara, Audrey and Cleo exchanged a small high five to their success. Lunch Time... Cleo was on her way out to the benches to meet the girls when Gabe stopped her \"Hey your the girl who's dad owns Slam FM right?\" he asked, Cleo had no idea what to say so she just nodded, although she was slightly dissapointed that the small fact of her step-dad was the only reason he knew her \"You think I could talk to you for a sec?\" he asked hopefully, she nodded and he smiled \"Awesome, you headin' outside?\" he asked, she nodded and they started walking \"Here's the thing I'm not sure how Radio Rebels got hold of our song yesterday but I was wondering if you did? Did your dad tell you anything?\" he asked, Cleo shook her head \"S..Sorry, he uh doesn't speak, uh much about it\" she replied mentally cursing herself afterwards for the stuttering \"No biggie, just curious. See yah\" he said before walking away, Cleo groaned, it had been her chance to get to know the guy she was crushing on and she blew it \"Hey wait\" Cleo turned around to see him coming back \"I'm Gabe, from the G's I'm sure you heard our song the other night right?\" he asked rather stuck up, Cleo inwardly rolled her eyes \"Yeah 'Turn it all around' right? Was a good song I'll admit, I'm Cleo by the way\" she introduced, he nodded \"Thanks, nice to meet you\" he said eyeing her up for a spilt second, but she caught it \"Cleo!\" she turned around to see Audrey and Tara watching her, she turned back to Gabe \"I gotta go, see yah round\" she said before walking away, as soon as she reached the girls they bombarded her with questions \"It's no biggie guys he just wanted to know if I knew how his song got on Slam FM\" she said casually while shrugging \"Nothing else happened?\" Tara asked disbelievingly \"No I swear, if it did I would tell you, guess he's just a jerk like Audrey said\" Cleo said, they both shrugged. After School - Outside Slam FM... Tara and Cleo were about to reach the entrance to Slam FM when they noticed Larry and Barry out front \"Damn\" Cleo whispered as she and Tara hid behind a bush, they heard the sound of a door open and Tara saw a man about to go back through the back door \"Cleo c'mon\" she whispered tugging her sister to the back door, they reached it and ran through before it closed, when Tara and Cleo got into the live room Tara opened the shuttersand they both found Tammi was in the other room, she shouted something but neither girl heard it \"What? Come out here\" Cleo said motioning her into the room, Tammi ran in \"Did you see the posters?\" she repeated \"Hard to miss their everywhere\" Tara said \"I know our mom just called me and said your on the bus I was like no were at Slam, and she said no no no, your on the bus like the side of it\" Cleo said still in shock from it \"Their spending money on marketing for you which means the ratings must be up, you girls are famous\" Tammi said \"No were not, the Radio Rebels are, even Gavin has a thing for them\" Tara said dissapointedly \"That's good, we like Gavin right?\" Tammi asked, Cleo chuckled and sat down on the red couch \"Yes we do, and it was hard enough when I just had Stacey to deal with now I'm competing with myself for his attention, well and Cleo\" Tara said in thought \"And I appear to be losing\" she added \"Look sis you just gotta get closer to him, yah know get to know the guy\" Cleo said shrugging \"Yeah this coming from the girl who can't even speak to Gabe\" Tara said knowingly \"Hey in my defence I talked to him earlier, plus it's different\" Cleo replied in a babyish tone \"How?\" Tara asked \"I don't know maybe because the boy you like is nice and sweet and the boy I like is a complete douche\" Cleo said, Tara nodded in agreement \"Anyway you girls have got fan clubs in schools all over Seattle, I mean look at all the patitions\" Tammi said turning to the screen, Tara and Cleo bent down to get a look \"We want a dance break everyday, we want more of the Radio Rebels, don't take our music away\" Tammi read from the screen \"Wait I have a really good idea\" Tara said, they all stood back up straight \"Okay this is what were gonna do...\" Tara went into explanation and the other two girls listened intently.[Chapter 7] Next Day At School - Lunch Time... Everybody within 100 miles could've heard the music blaring out of the Slam FM car speakers, it was lunch time and nearly everyone in the school were dancing to it, Tara stood by the wall with Audrey and Cleo watching everyone \"What is going on?\" Audrey asked \"Well no one can complain about us missing class time, because it's lunch\" Tara answere while smirking proudly \"This was your idea?\" Audrey asked, Tara nodded \"It's amazing right?\" Cleo asked, Audrey squealed and nodded \"Hey hey hey Lincoln Bay, this is Tammi Q comin' at you live yall feelin' good today?\" Tammi asked before holding up the mic, everyone cheered \"Alright listen up I got a special message from our good friends, the Radio Rebels\" Tammi said, she pressed something from the inside of the car so that the message played \"These are your Radio Rebels comin' at you with a little lunchtime surprise\" Tara's voice said through the speaker \"Now a lot of you have IM'd us talking about the powers to be taking away our music and it feels like part of ourselves has been taken away\" Cleo's voice said, everyone boo'd \"That's not gonna make us better students and you can't punish someone for relaxing during their down time, right principal Moreno?\" Tara's voice said \"That's right you took our music and were giving it back, text and request because lunch time is our time\" Cleo's voice said, everybody cheered including Audrey, Tara and Cleo \"Alright I know I shouldn't but I just can't help it\" Cleo said handing Audrey her bag, Tara and Audrey gave Cleo confused looks \"I love dancing\" she innocently while walking backwards, the other two girls laughed as Cleo started dancing with 3 other girls, as Cleo danced she was unaware of the eyes watching her. Later On In Slam FM... \"If you don't go to Lincoln Bay High, you missed a rockstar day\" Tara said \"I know I've never seen so many people dancing, I was one of them I'm proud to admit\" Cleo said crossing her legs on the swirly chair \"So were giving a big shout out today for everyone who danced at Lincoln Bay high today, we saw it and you guys totally made our day\" Tara said \"So this next songs for you...\" Cleo said, she pressed one of the songs on the screen before taking of her headset \"Man, can you believe it? So many people listening to us Tara, it's amazing\" she said spinning on the chair \"Yeah I'll admit it was pretty cool\" Tara said nodding \"And there's a good part to it\" she added, Cleo stopped her spinning and faced her sister \"What?\" she asked curiously \"Gabe couldn't take his eyes off you\" Tara said smiling, Cleo laughed. AN: Sorry it's so short x[Chapter 8] Few Days Later... Tara and Cleo walked into the hallway and Audrey ran up to them \"I have news, but we can't talk here\" she whispered \"What?\" Cleo asked as Audrey dragged them to the janitors closet \"Um I'm sorry but could you give us a second\" she said to the janitor \"But this is my office\" he complained, Audrey nudged her head towards the door and he left, she shut the door \"So, guess who got nominated for prom queen\" she said rolling her eyes \"Stacy\" Tara said \"You girls did, well not you two the Radio Rebels\" Audrey squealed \"This is horrible, the whole point of the Radio Rebels is that their anonymus remember?\" Cleo asked \"What's gonna happen if they win who's gonna go up there and accept the crown?\" Tara asked \"We could get expelled, look we have to put a stop to this\" Cleo said in thought \"Are you crazy, you girls can't quiet now\" Audrey said, the door opened and they turned their heads \"Not now Mr Mcgowski\" Audrey said \"But I need the broom\" he said, Audrey handed him the broom before closing the door again \"Audrey we can't do this anymore\" Tara said \"You can\" she replied \"We can't\" Cleo said agreeing with her sister \"You can\" Audrey repeated, the door opened again and they all turned \"Not now\" they all said in sync \"I need the dustpan too\" Mr Mcgowski said, Tara gave it to him and Audrey once again closed the door \"You two are hero's to people and that's why they nominated you, you can't turn your backs on them now, this is your time to shine\" she said smiling \"What if we don't wanna shine? What if shining really isn't our thing?\" Cleo asked nervously \"As your BFFTLEWE I'm legally obligated to make sure you girls do the show\" Audrey said \"Even if I have to drag you there\" she added, Tara and Cleo chuckled before leaving the closet with Audrey. After Audrey went the opposite way Gavin approached Tara and Cleo \"Hey Tara, we got another demo on the way for Radio Rebels\" he said \"Oh well I'm sure she'd be stoked to hear it\" Tara replied, Cleo rolled her eyes \"Hi Gavin, I'm Cleo Tara's sister\" she said holding out her hand, Gavin shook it \"Nice to meet you\" he said smiling \"So I assume the bands doing well?\" Cleo asked trying to get some info on him, it was a sisters job to make sure the guy who could end up dating her sister wasn't a total jerk \"Yeah, ever since our song was played by the Radio Rebels things have really been taking off\" he said \"Yeah I heard it, you guys are really good\" Cleo said, he smiled \"Thanks\" he said, Tara looked at him \"We need to uh...\" she made a go motion with her hand and he nodded \"Yeah sure, it was nice meeting you Cleo and good talking to you Tara\" he said, both girls nodded before walking away. After School Outside Slam FM... \"Remind me why we had to park so far away\" Audrey said \"Because we can't risk anybody recognizing the car\" Tara said \"Or us\" Cleo added as she put on the blonde wig making sure to cover all brown curly hair \"Alright wig me\" Tara said, Cleo handed the girls their own wigs before putting on her own light brown trench coat, the girls did the same before exiting the car. The girl stook off their cover up as soon as they entered the building \"And this is where the magic happens\" Tara said letting Audrey into the Live Room \"This is so cool\" Audrey exclaimed \"Well is this the famous Audrey Sharma?\" Tammi asked giving Audrey a brief hug \"It's so nice to meet you\" she said \"You too\" Audrey said, the door opened and the girls turned to see Rob \"Could you girls excuse us for a moment?\" he asked motioning to Tara and Cleo, Audrey and Tammi both nodded before leaving the room \"Look if this is about Audrey being here then we swear she's the only person we've told...\" Tara was cut off by Rob \"No it's not about Audrey, this is about you two, Principal Moreno called, the lunch time dance party was a mistake, she wants to expell the Radio Rebels as soon as she finds out who they are\" he said \"Well as long as she doesn't know it's us then we shouldn't have a problem\" Cleo said leaning back agains't the desk \"Well I can't take that chance though can I?\" he asked \"What d'you mean?\" Tara asked \"Look I may run Slam FM, but I'm sure step-father first, and it's unfortunate but this has gone too far\" he said walking closer \"Yes it has, it's too far to stop now, look this is bigger than Slam or Moreno or even us, we can't turn our backs on the thousans of people who finally feel like they have a voice\" Cleo said \"And I'm not going back to that shy invisible girl who's afraid to even speak, and Cleo's not going back to the girl who can't stand up to the bigger people\" Tara said firmly \"Look we know that it's risky\" she said \"You know I think that's the most I've heard Tara and Cleo say at one time\" he said \"Your on in two minutes\" he said before heading towards the door \"Good luck girls\" he said closing the door. On The Show... \"Well we understand that a lot of you wanna know who we are, we get that and maybe it'd be easier if you could see our faces...\" Cleo started while playing with a small jelly ball \"But see you guys it's not about us Radio Rebels, it's about you so you don't need to know our names, you wanna know who I am? Let's for the sake of confusion call me Rebel 1, I am somebody who's tired of being afraid and I know how it can hold you back\" Tara said \"And I'm Rebel 2, you can tell the differences between the voices, but what does it matter, you guys wanna know who I am? I'm the girl who's afraid of standing up for myself, afraid of it backfiring and blowing up in my face, and I'm afraid of talking to my crushs, but hey what girl don't get like that\" Cleo said in thought while chuckling a little, Tara smiled \"So, why don't you guys say it out loud, what your afraid of, call in, we dare you\" Tara said pushing a few buttons on the screen, they waited to see if any callers came in but nothing happened \"I guess everyone's too afraid to say what their afraid of\" Tara said \"Maybe this song'll inspire you...\" Tara said reaching for the switch, Tammi knocked on the window \"Lines 1 through 20\" she said, Tara and Cleo looked at their screens to see the green light switch flashing \"Alright you guys well done\" Cleo said smiling, Tara touched the line 1 button \"Your on with Radio Rebel\" she said. After a lot of calls it finally reached one where Cleo though Tara should keep on it \"I'm afraid to do my own thing\" Gavin said, Cleo moved away from the mic and left the headset \"I was too\" Tara said \"Was? So what changed?\" Gavin asked \"I guess I started doing the show with Rebel 2 and that's when I realised, your not as alone as you feel. And if you can remember that then it makes it easier to take a risk, yah know, do your own thing\" Tara said \"Yeah, thanks\" Gavin said before hanging up \"Okay were gonna take some more calls in a minute, but for the mean time you guys are gonna seriously dig this song\" Tara said pressing a song on the screen, the music played and she took off the headset and headed for the door, Audrey ran out of the other room \"Hey, where are you going?\" she asked \"Just somewhere, to do something\" Tara replied smiling before exiting the room \"I'm afraid of Hyenas\" Audrey exclaimed before taking a deep breath, Cleo chuckled and sat back down in the swirly chair.[Chapter 9] At The House... Tara and Cleo were in their room studying when their mom burst through the door \"Congratulations\" she exclaimed \"On what?\" Cleo asked looking up from her work \"Your prom queen nominations are on the school website and I'm so excited\" she replied \"But what about Principal Moreno? Mom if the Radio Rebels win and we confess our identity then we could get expelled, both of us\" Tara said \"I don't care about Principal Moreno, girls people nominated you for prom queen because you inspire them, and your standing up for your beliefs that's all I care about\" their mom said sitting down on the bed \"I don't think I'm going to prom\" Tara said after a few seconds thought \"Yeah me either\" Cleo said \"Then let me refrase that, all I care about is you standing up for your beliefs and prom, you guys have to go I mean it's prom\" their mom said, the girls tried to protest but their mom wouldn't have it \"Uh yeah your going to prom\" she said before rushing back out, the girls looked at each other \"You'd think our mom could at least respect our decision\" Cleo said shaking her head. Next Day At School... \"This is your principal, there's been some contreversie about the identity of the Radio Rebels, and there is nothing more distractin than contreversie, now I gave them the chance to do the right thing and turn theirselves in, but they chose to hide avoiding the consequences of their insubordination. Well they can't hide forever which is why until the Radio Rebels identity's are revealed, I'm cancelling the prom\" the Principal said over the speaker, everyone began chatting to theirselves and Cleo turned to the girls \"This is so not fair\" she exclaimed, Tara nodded and looked around nervously \"This is bad, this is really really bad\" she said. Outside Slam FM... The girls were in the midst of people protesting agains't the Radio Rebels \"Prom is a right of passage, if the Radio Rebels are all about the people, then they'll reveal their identities and give us our prom back\" Stacy said over the large mic \"Man how are we gonna get in there?\" Tara asked watching the entrance, Tammi saw them throught the window and waved, the girls mouthed 'Help' and she nodded, a woman approached the girls with a camera and microphone \"Who do you blame for your prom getting cancelled?\" she asked \"Oh look everybody it's Radio Rebel\" Audrey shouted pointing in a direction, Cleo looked and instantly knew it was Tammi with her hood up, while everybody chased after her the girls ran for the entrance. They soon got into the Live Room and were on the air \"Hey out there in Radio land, a lot's happened since we last hung out huh?\" Tara asked \"Look we know you guys are upset, but were gonna hear what you think, were not gonna shut you out, so call us text us write on our wall, we wanna know what you think\" Cleo said pressing one of the caller buttons, which she soon regreted doing. After a lot of insults Tara pressed another \"Your on line two\" she said sighing \"I've always liked you Radio Rebels, your playlists totally rock but...\" Gavin paused \"Go ahead, let it out\" Tara said \"It's just that there's a girl I was hoping to impress that night\" he finished \"Stacy\" Audrey whispered, Cleo rolled her eyes \"Sorry about that\" she said \"Yeah, me too\" he said before hanging up \"Well, I guess you guys are pretty upset, I'll uh just play some music...\" Tara said pressing one of the songs \"This one's for you guys, thanks for being honest with us and were really sorry we let you down\" she said, Cleo sighed and leaned back on the couch with her legs up \"Their just angry, you know they'll come around, it doesn't take away from all the good things you've done as Radio Rebels\" Rob said entering the room \"Did you hear them? They hate us, we ruined their prom\" Tara said sadly \"Guys I feel horrible\" Cleo piped up from the couch next to Audrey \"Why? You girls didn't ruin it that principal did\" Tammi said \"I knew she was angry, but I didn't know she was gonna do something like this\" Tara said \"Man that Moreno's such a backwards thinker\" Tammi said \"Backwards, that's brilliant\" Tara said \"What?\" Cleo asked \"Backwards, backwards\" Tara repeated looking at Audrey and Cleo, they both gave her confused looks. After the show had finished the girls got to the entrance only to find everyone still there \"Man don't they have a life? I thought they'd be gone by now\" Cleo said annoyed, Tara noticed the dancing sandwich \"This calls for a proffesional\" she said before dragging the girls behind the desk. \"Somebody order the meaty subtacular?\" the sandwich asked \"Hello?\" he asked leaning over the desk, the girls popped their heads up and he jumped \"Hi, could you do us a favor?\" Cleo asked hopefully \"Uh you want extra marronera?\" he asked in confusion \"Oh that would be awesome\" Audrey exclaimed \"Audrey\" Tara said remindingly \"And focusing\" she said \"You see those girls out there?\" Cleo asked, the sandwich turned around \"We need to get out there without any of them seeing us\" Tara said \"You can count on me\" Sandwich replied before leaving, after a few seconds Audrey, Tara and Cleo sneaked through the back door, once Cleo saw the sandwich dancing she wanted to laugh, but she kept it in long enough, well at least until they got home.[Chapter 10] Next Morning at School... \"Good morning Lincoln Bay High School, this is Tammi Q from Slam FM bringing you a special message from...\" Tammi's voice said over the school speaker \"Your Radio Rebels here, now we wanna let you guys know that you really unleashed your fury about the prom drama and we want you to know you've totally been heard...\" Cleo's voice said \"Yeah I mean cancelling prom was monumentally unfair but blaming Moreno isn't going to solve anything, but we wanna do something about it and so does Slam which is why were giving you guys what you want, your prom back\" Tara's voice said, everyone in the class cheered including Tara, Cleo and Audrey \"Slam FM is throwing it's first ever Morp, that's prom spelt backwards because were turning prom upside down. Tickets are free and everyone is invited so don't worry about finding a date or spending your college savings on a dress or a tux or limo, just come as you are because that's the way we like you\" Cleo's voice said, everyone cheered again \"Personally, your best idea ever\" Cleo said to Tara \"I know right? I hope it goes well though\" she said, Cleo and Audrey nodded. Later On at Slam... \"So we've been getting a lot of questions about the Morp which rules cuz you all seem stoked to go\" Cleo said through the mic \"Which is the whole point right? A party where everyone feels like royalty, but then again maybe we should crown a Morp king and queen. I mean after all people were nominated\" Tara said playing with the wall guitar \"And if that's what you want then that's what we'll do, Morp is all your's so make sure to vote for you'r favourite Morp King and Queen, make your voices heard\" Cleo said, Tara smirked \"Especially our number one fan\" she said, Cleo gave her a curious look but Tara merely winked in response. Next Day at School - With Cleo... It was lunch time and Cleo was sat at the table with Audrey \"Where's Tara?\" Cleo asked in confusion \"She's rehearsing with Gavin and Stacey, feel sorry for her\" Audrey replied, Cleo chuckled \"Hey, Cleo right?\" Cleo turned her head to see Gabe leaning agains't the table looking at her, she nodded \"Yeah, Gabe right?\" she asked mockingly, he clicked his tongue in annoyance \"Yeah, can I talk to you?\" he asked, she nodded \"Sure\" she said getting out of the seat, she followed him over to another table and they both sat down \"Stacey wanted me to tell you that there's a party tonight, at 7:00 over her place and everyone's invited\" he said, Cleo tensed \"Well tell her I can't, I have things to do...\" Gabe cut her off \"Yeah she said you might say that, and she told me to tell you that ifn you don't come then she'll have proof about your secret\" he said as though it had been repeated, Cleo inwardly gasped \"What secret?\" she asked slightly nervous, he shook his head \"Look I don't know I'm just saying what she told me, so you goin'?\" he asked inpatiently, Cleo sighed \"Look tell her I might be there\" she said standing up \"Hey Cleo\" he called, she turned around with a hand in her hair nervously \"I'd be stoked if you came, just sayin'\" he said before walking away, she smiled despite her nervousness and headed back to Audrey.[Chapter 11] After School... \"Tara we both have to go, otherwise she'll know were the Radio Rebels\" Cleo exclaimed gesturing to herself and Tara \"I know, I can't believe this\" Tara said shaking her head nervously \"What are we gonna do?\" Cleo asked, Tara thought for a moment \"I have an idea, but were gonna need Tammi's help and mom's\" she said, Cleo gave her sister a confused look. At Stacey's House... \"Hi\" Stacey and Kim looked down from the balcony to see Tara stood there with Cleo, both girls looking innoccent \"Here we are\" Tara said \"So I see, but I'm still watching you. Both of you\" Stacey snapped, Cleo closed the front door before going into the living room wth her sister, they found Audrey and Tara sat on the couch while Cleo sat on the arm from lack of space \"These are your Radio Rebels comin' atcha live from Slam FM\" Cleo's voice said over the radio, Cleo looked up at Stacey who was on the balcony and shrugged \"Tonight is all about you, lines are open you know the number\" Tara's voice said \"I'm calling into the show\" Stacey declared while dialling on her cell, Cleo glanced at Tara nervously \"How are you girls here and there?\" Audrey asked obviously confused, Tara said nothing \"Your on with the Radio Rebels\" Tara's voice said \"D'you know your a hypocrite?\" Stacey asked \"What's your name caller?\" Cleo's voice asked \"Save it, you say your all about the people but Morp is all about you...\" while Stacey was on a rampage over the phone Cleo felt someone watching her, she looked around until she locked eyes with her starer, he winked at her and she bit her lip shyly before looking back up at the still rampaging Stacey \"...I'm not done with you, sorry but we can't all be winners and I'm gonna win, despite the fact that I don't have an entire Radio Station campaigning for me...\" Cleo's eyes widened when Tara stood up and left the room, Stacey looked down and noticed Tara was missing \"Why so quiet? Does the truth hurt?\" Stacey asked spitefully \"You wanna know the truth?\" Tara's voice said over the radio \"Hey I really need to use the bathroom\" a male voice said in the background of the radio, Stacey moved away from the balcony and Cleo looked at Audrey nervously \"Is there anything to drink around here I feel a bit weird\" she said, Audrey nodded \"Yeah out back\" she said, they both stood up but heard something over the radio that cracked them all up \"I'm just a little bit worried about you Stacey, I'm afraid that if me or Rebel 2 beat you out for Morp queen, your fragile ego won't be able to survive\" Tara said, Cleo laughed but was starting to wonder where her sister was in the house \"You know what? It can wait\" Cleo said, Audrey smiled and they both fell back onto the couch. A While Later... After Tara had hung up on the Radio Rebel line Cleo and Audrey had decided to go outside with everybody else, Tara eventually joined them \"That was amazing, she was freaked out\" Audrey said handing Tara a drink \"Absolutely amazing sis\" Cleo said from Audrey's left, they all looked at the band who were setting up and Gavin smiled at Tara \"And Gavin just smiled at you\" Audrey said \"Oh I think it was more of a general smile\" Tara said inwardly jumping for joy \"It seemed pretty sepcific\" Cleo said shrugging, Barry and Larry came over \"Hey guys\" Cleo greeted hugging them both \"Hey\" they both said \"We're the G's and this is 'We so fine\" Gabe said over the mic, the music started up and they all bobbed to it, after a few seconds Stacey bashed into Audrey which caused Audrey to spill some of her drink on Stacey \"Are you kidding me?\" she exclaimed \"I didn't do anything\" Audrey said defending herself \"You come to my house and you spill your drink on me, this cost a fortune\" Stacey snapped, all girls gaped for a minute \"It was an accident Stacey, Audrey would never do something as mean as that, unlike some people we know\" Cleo said crossing her arms \"Do you know what your problem is...\" Stacey started but Cleo cut her off \"No, I don't think I have a problem and I don't wanna know what you think my problem is, I'm tired of listening to you Stacey, not everything revolves around what you say. So turn around and walk away\" she said, Stacey pasued for a moment before stomping away \"Thanks for that, I think the Radio Rebels are rubbing off on you too\" Audrey said giving Cleo a quick hug \"That felt good\" Cleo said \"You should be really proud Cle', you just stood up for yourself and your friend\" Tara said, Cleo smiled and they turned back to the band. After The Party... It was now dark out but there were a few people around, Audrey had gone and so had Larry and Barry, but Cleo had stayed because Tara wanted to speak to Gavin \"It's okay you just go over there\" Tara whispered to herself, Cleo chuckled \"Hey\" Gavin said popping up behind Tara, Tara smiled and Cleo got the hint \"I have to um...\" she said walking backwards \"...By-bye\" she said turning around, Cleo got a few feet forward before she bumped into someone \"Hey watch it\" the person said, Cleo looked up about to do some serious insulting when she realised who it was \"Oh, hey Cleo\" Gabe said, she nodded in greeting \"Hey Rockstar, good song\" she said, he smiled \"Thanks, where you headed now anyways?\" he asked, she shrugged \"Probably wait for Tara and then head home, nothin' else to do right?\" she asked, he nodded \"Fair enough, you look good\" he said glancing at my clothes \"Thanks, not bad yourself\" she said, he chuckled \"So you goin' Morp?\" he asked leaning agains't the wall, Cleo shrugged \"Not sure, probably\" she replied \"Awesome, hope I'll see you there\" he said winking, she smiled \"Maybe you will\" she said biting her lip \"I have to help load the van, but I'll see you round?\" he asked, she nodded \"Later Rockstar\" she said walking past him, he smirked and watched her walk away before heading over to Gavin who was talking to Tara.[Chapter 12] At School... Cleo was sat in the audience with Audrey looking around, she knew Tara was in school but she couldn't see her anywhere \"Do you know where Tara is?\" Audrey whispered as Kim was in the middle of a perfformance \"I don't know, there's no way she would miss this though\" Cleo replied shaking her head, Cleo stayed quiet for a few more seconds before she got antsy \"I'm sorry I need to find out where she is\" she said getting out of her seat, Audrey nodded \"I'll let you know if she comes in\" she said, Cleo nodded and headed backstage first \"Cleo\" she turned around to see Gavin \"Hey Gavin\" she greeted \"Have you seen Tara?\" he asked, she shook her head \"No I'm sorry, I don't know where she is I mean she came to school with me this morning and it isn't like her to make a no-show\" Cleo said \"It's not long until were on\" he said nervously, Cleo sighed \"I'm gonna go look for her in a bit, if she doesn't show soon I'll fine her\" she said, he nodded \"Hey Gavin\" she said, he looked at her \"Your a really cool guy, I'm not flirting with you trust me, I just wanna say that your way different than I thought\" she said, he smiled a little \"Thanks\" he said, she nodded and stayed by the side but behind the curtain so no one in the audience could see her \"Dude, ready to rock out with the drama dorks?\" she heard, she looked to see Gabe and the other two from the band talking to Gavin \"That's funny, have you guys seen Tara? She's late\" Gavin said desperatley \"Move on already, pay attention to Stacey\" Gabe exclaimed, Cleo's mouth opened in shock and anger \"Your turning into a real jerk you know that don't you?\" Gavin asked, Gabe chuckled in disbelief \"Me?\" he asked \"Yeah\" Gavin said \"Your the one who needs to get his priority's straight\" Gabe said pointing at Gavin \"Or what? Your gonna kick me outta the band?\" Gavin asked \"Is that what you want?\" Gabe asked \"What I want is for you to drop the stupid Rockstar act for five minutes, try just try to be a normal person\" Gavin said annoyed \"Okay I am the front man of this band, this Rockstar act is what put us on the map, if you don't wanna be part of that then that's fine with us\" Gabe said, Cleo shook her head \"What happened to G's for life?\" Gavin asked \"Hmm yeah ask yourself that, enjoy your solo career Gavin\" Gabe said turning around, Cleo came out from behind the curtain and sighed \"You heard that?\" he asked, she nodded \"Yeah, can't believe I've had a crush on him since 3rd grade\" she said shaking her head \"If it helps, he had a huge crush on you before we turned popular, still does actually\" Gavin said, she smiled a little \"Really?\" she asked not believing him \"Yeah, he used to talk about you all the time when we were younger\" he said, she nodded \"Alright I'm gonna try and find Tara, hopefully she has a good reason\" Cleo said heading for the exit \"Try and be quick Cleo\" he begged, she nodded and ran out into the hall. Few Minutes Later... After running through the hallways looking for Tara, Cleo was beginning to get tired \"Where the hell is she?\" she exclaimed \"Someone let me out!\" Cleo heard, she knew it sounded like Tara \"Tara?\" she shouted, the shouting started up again and she followed it to the Janitor's closet, the janitor was opening the door and Tara came running out \"Tara what the hell?\" Cleo exclaimed, Tara grabbed her sisters hand \"No time to explain must get to class\" she said pulling Cleo down the hallway. They finally ran through the back door of the stage in time to see Stacey kiss Gavin as the final part of the show, Gavin saw the girls and Tara gave him an apolagetic look, he held the back of his head and walked out slowly \"Oh look he is so dissapointed in you, and who can blame him\" Stacey said, she pushed the girls further back and glared at them \"Okay Radio Drivells, you were bad enough when you didn't talk, but trying to destroy me on your stupid Radio show, did you really think you'd get away with that?\" she asked, Cleo rolled her eyes \"Look your wrong were not them...\" Cleo was cut off by Stacey \"Save it, your not them? Then explain this\" she said pressing something on her phone \"I was afraid we biffed the call, Tara and Cleo were right, you can be in two places at once\" their mom's voice said through the recording \"That doesn't prove anything\" Tara said \"No? Then you won't mind if I e-mail it to the whole school? And Moreno\" Stacey said \"What do you want Stacey? What could you possibly gain from this?\" Cleo asked wondering why the girl was so mean \"Morp queen, you girls are gonna make sure I win, or the Radio Rebels are, tell everyone on your show to vote for me, and if you say anything about this little private moment. Then I'll tell everyone who you girls really are\" Stacey replied before walking away, Cleo looked at Tara sadly \"This is so messed up\" she said shaking her head, Tara sighed. In The Live Room... \"Okay, I had a bad day and it kinda shook me up, well both me and Rebel 2 actually. Made me wonder, are we doing the right thing, I mean is it worth it if we get expelled? or if it messes things up with the guy I like, I don't know. But I do know that there will be people out there who try and take things away from us but things bigger than prom, and we can just sit back and watch it happen. Or we can stand up for ourselves, I mean we all deserve to dance to our own playlists no matter what Moreno or anyone else has to say about it\" Tara said a bit depressed, Cleo sighed quietly and put a hand to her head in realisation \"Oh yeah and before I forget, we both know that all you guys wanna vote one of us for Morp queen just to find out who we are. But we don't need that crown, but Stacey Debane she kinda does, so just keep that in mind when you vote\" she said reluctantly.[Chapter 13] Morp... Everybody from the school were at Slam FM studio enjoying themselves apart from Cleo and Tara who hadn't shown up yet \"Where's Tara and Cleo?\" Audrey asked Barry and Larry \"Uh more to the point where are the Radio Rebels?\" Barry asked \"Oh my true love shall be revealed\" Barry said looking around \"How do I look?\" he asked putting on his hat \"Uh a little green which could be the lighting or worse\" Larry replied squeezing some hand sanitizer on Barry's and Audrey's hands \"Now to recap which Rebel did you call dibs on?\" Larry asked, Barry sighed in annoyence \"I thought I told you before, I get dibs on Rebel 1 and you get dibs on Rebel 2\" he said, Larry nodded and they all looked up, their expressions turned to one of awe as Cleo and Tara walked in \"Hey guys\" Cleo greeted \"You guys look amazing\" Audrey exclaimed \"Thank you, you look great too\" Cleo said, Tara grabbed Audrey's hand and pulled her a little bit far away from the boys \"Have you seen Gavin I really should talk to him\" Tara said \"Wait what are you gonna say?\" Audrey asked \"I don't know\" Tara said, she started gasping in panick \"Are we missing something?\" Barry asked \"Boys wait here, conference now\" Cleo said taking her sisters hand and leading them somewhere secluded. \"I don't know what to do I'm freaking out\" Tara said \"Just breath\" Audrey said, Tara started to breath in and out slowly before nodding to us reasuringly \"Okay\" she said \"Alright let's go\" Cleo said as they all stood up, they suddenly paused in their movements once they saw Stacey on her own looking into a small mirror \"You are beautiful. And you are queen no matter what happens\" she said, she closed the small mirror and took a deep breath before walking away, the girls looked at each other and headed back into the main hall. They all got into the hall and while they were walking someone took Cleo's hand stopping her in her walking \"Cleo\" she turned around and found it was Gabe \"What?\" she snapped pulling her hand away slowly \"What's up with you?\" he asked in confusion \"Look I'll admit I used to be crushing on you big time, but when you were talking to Gavin at the drama perfformances the other day telling him to chose Stacey over my sister it really ticked me off\" she exclaimed in anger, he sighed \"Look I didn't mean it like that...\" he started, she held up a hand signalling him to be quiet, which he did \"Gabe, if you think that Tara isn't good enough for Gavin then why are you talking to me huh? Is it because my dad owns Slam FM is that it?\" she asked, he shook his head \"No nothing even remotely close to that\" he said getting a bit frustrated \"Then what?\" she shouted gettin closer to him, he looked around for a moment before staring at her in thought \"Exactly\" she said turning around and walking back over to Tara and Audrey.[Chapter 14] \"Good evening Seattle, you ready to find out who your Morp queen is?\" Tammi asked from the stage, everyone cheered but Tara and Cleo less enthusiastically \"It's time to see who will win the crowns at Lincoln Bay High\" she said \"We did have 2 nominations for Morp King but one dropped out...\" Tammi said shrugging, Tara looked over at Gavin who shrugged \"So that leave's Gabe Laveilat\" she declared, everyone cheered apart from Cleo who crossed her arms, he jogged onto the stage looking happier than ever and bowed, Tammi put the crown on him making it official, this made Cleo and Tara very nervous as they would find out who was queen \"And now I'd like to invite your Morp court princess's up here to join me on stage\" Tammi said, nervousness filled Cleo to the brink of her feeling sick \"I can't stay I just can't\" she whimpered to Tara, Audrey and Tara tried to get her to stay but she ran backstage anyway. Cleo could hear everything going on in the main hall, so far they had only said Stacey's name but it had seemed as though \"Cleo\" Tara whispered looking for her sister \"I'm over here Tara\" she said fiddling with her hands, Tara sighed and sat down on the floor next to her \"You okay?\" she asked, Cleo shook her head \"No I'm not, I know that were supposed to go up there in a few minutes and tell everyone were the Radio Rebels but Tara I can't\" she said on the verge of tears \"Cleo you can't just drop out now, I can't go up there without you\" Tara said, Cleo sighed and a tear fell down her cheek \"Tara I'm so scared, I'm scared because you know how much I hate crowds and how I hate people's attention on me, I can't stand it Tara not that many people\" she said, Tara nodded \"And the Radio Rebels!\" they heard Tammi say loudly over the mic, Cleo let a few more tears fall \"Cleo, you remember the day we first came to Slam FM?\" Tara asked, Cleo looked at her and nodded \"Remember how scared I was? You helped me get through that, were sisters remember\" Tara said smiling while taking Cleo's hands into her own \"And what was it we used to say when we were little?\" she asked in a playfull tone, Cleo smiled a little \"Best Friends as well as twin sisters\" she said, Tara nodded \"That's right, and tonight were gonna tell everyone who we really are and settle all of this. I'll be there with you every step of the way Cleo, c'mon sis\" Tara said standing up, Cleo sighed and took a deep breath before wiping away her tears and standing up. Back In The Main Hall... Rob gave the girls a thumbs up and clicked the button to turn on the microphones \"Most of you don't know me, I'm the girl who sits in the back of the class and never raises her hand, who is so afraid of saying the wrong thing that she says nothing instead, the old me would have frozen in front of a crowd like this, but something happened and suddenly the real stuff we were dealing with at school became more important than my fears, look I wasn't sure I was gonna do this tonight, and neither was Rebel 2, but I need to be true to myself, so here goes\" Tara said through her microphone, she took one glance at Cleo who shook her head signalling she was unable to do it and stepped forward from behind the wall \"I'm Rebel 1\" Cleo heard Tara say, it was silent for a moment before she heard everyone start clapping, Cleo closed her eyes and slid down the wall until she was sitting with her knees pulled up, she took a deep breath before putting the mic close to her lips \"And now that everyone know's who Rebel 1 is I suppose you all wanna know who Rebel 2 is right?\" she asked, everybody went quiet again \"I'm won't lie I'm not as brave as Tara, I actually just now decided I was gonna come out and say who I was, I'm still deciding weather or not to do this but what the hell right?\" Cleo asked standing up, she slowly started down the steps \"My situation is a little similar to Tara's though, I could never talk in front of a crowd, terrified of messing things up I guess. But how do you know somethings not good or bad if you don't try right? A real smart woman taught me that, but here it goes I guess, my turn to show everyone right?\" she asked as she stood on the last step, the only one's that could see her were Gabe, Tara, Tammi and Stacey \"Here goes nothin'\" she said stepping down the last step, she slowly made her way over to Tara who was smiling, everything was quiet before they all started cheering and clapping again, Cleo smiled and side hugged Tara who hugged her back, suddenly to everyone's surprise Principal Moreno walked onto the stage causing everyone to top what they were doing, she took Tara's mic \"Thank you for an enlightening evening, and now that I know who the Radio Rebels are...\" she said pointing to Tara and Cleo \"They are deffinatly getting expelled\" Moreno said chuckling, everyone gasped and made sounds of protest \"Enjoy your Morp Tara and Cleo. And don't bother coming to school on Monday\" she added smiling like a lunatic, Cleo sighed \"Thought that would happen\" she mumbled to Tara who nodded \"I'm one of the Radio Rebels!\" Audrey shouted from the crowd \"Yeah me too\" Gavin said stepping forward, before Tara or Cleo could get their heads around it everyone were shouting out that they were one of the Rebels \"You can't expel everyone can you?\" Tammi asked cockily, Moreno looked around with an angered and annoyed look on her face, Cleo laughed in surprise as everyone started chanting in sync 'I'm a Radio Rebel', Moreno reluctantly handed the microphone to Tara and walked off in a huff, as soon as she walked away everybody cheered \"I believe this belongs to one of you\" Tammi said handing Cleo the crown, her and Tara both glanced at the crown and then at each other \"Well I guess because were all Radio Rebels this crown belongs to all of us, so congratulations kings and queens\" Tara said, everyone cheered again and Cleo chuckled before glancing at Stacey who didn't look so happy \"But there is one person who's been dreaming about this crown all of her life\" Cleo said through the mic while making her way over to Stacey who looked shocked \"Although were not sure if we heard her say she was one of the Radio Rebels\" Tara said aiming the mic at Stacey who smiled \"I'm a Radio Rebel, I'm so a Radio Rebel\" she exclaimed excitedly \"Well then I guess this belongs to you\" Cleo said carefully placing the crown on Stacey's head, everybody clapped \"Why are you girls being so nice to me? When I've been nothing but mean to you?\" she asked in confusion \"Because look at you right now Stacey, that dress and the crown you are 100% you right now, that's all us Radio Rebels could ask of anyone. You are yourself, and you've never been more beautiful\" Tara said, Stacey chuckled and everyone cheered again.[Chapter 15] After the crowning everybody went back to the party, the girls did have a few occasional people fuss over them a little bit but it was good for them and they enjoyed it, everyone had gotten crowns when Tammi started throwing them out into the crowd, at the moment Tara was with Audrey, Larry, Barry and Cleo was also with them, only she was sat on the drinks counter looking down at the crown she was playing with \"Hey Cleo\" she looked up to see Gabe in front of her with his hands in his pockets \"How's it going?\" he asked, she shrugged \"Can't complain\" she replied, Tara glanced between the two \"Hey guys come with me a sec\" she said to the others, they followed her and she gave Cleo a secret wink before walking away \"So your Rebel 2 huh?\" he asked, she nodded \"Yeah, who knew?\" she asked, he smiled a little \"Never saw that comin'. Look I just wanted you to know that I never flirted with you just because your Dad owned Slam FM, I never cared about that well not really. The truth is, I never thought you would go for me if I wasn't big, I mean a lot of girls are like that now, so I figured if I was cool and everything you would go for me\" he said a little embarassed, Cleo started laughing \"What?\" he asked, she shook her head \"It's just that, you've been secretly crushing on me and I've been secretly crushing on you, it's just humorous to me\" she said shrugging, he chuckled \"So how long have you been crushing on me exactly?\" she asked curiously, he smirked \"Long enough to do this\" he said, she was about to ask what he meant when he leaned forward and pressed his lips gently agains't hers, he stayed like that for a few seconds before pulling away \"Okay that was...good\" she said slightly surprised and a bit giddy, he chuckled \"Thanks, how about I take you out tomorrow?\" he asked, she nodded and bit her lip \"Sounds good Rockstar\" she said, he glanced down at the crown she was playing with \"May I my queen?\" he asked motioning to it, she nodded and let him take it from her \"Why of course you may\" she said in a posh tone, he chuckled and placed the crown on top of her head \"Looking good Rebel\" he said, she rolled her eyes \"Everyone please give it up for Lincoln Bay's very own Gavin Morgan\" Tammi said on the stage, everybody clapped as Gavin walked onto the stage with a guitar \"There's a girl I've like for a while now, she's the girl who's not afraid to ask a dancing sandwich for help\" Gavin said looking directly at Tara, Cleo's eyes widened \"He's the sandwich\" she said to herself, Gabe gave her a confused look \"Long story\" she said, he nodded and sat on the chair next to her legs before taking her hand in his own, she glanced at their hands before smiling a little and turning back to Gavin \"She inspired this song, this songs for her\" he said before playing the guitar, as he sung a lot of people waved their arms through the air or bobbed to the music, Tara stood their watching him in surprise while he watched her while singing \"Wait here a sec\" Gabe said handing Cleo his crown, she put it in her lap and watched as he and the other two band mates got on stage with Gavin and played back up, the music got more rocky and Cleo clapped to the music and looked at her sister who looked absolutely over the moon. Few Minutes Later... Tara was in the middle of talking to Gavin and Cleo made her way up to the roof, she found it cold but also the breeze was relaxing and the view was amazing \"Hey stranger\" she looked to see Gabe walking over to her \"How'd you know I was up here?\" she asked, he motioned to the door where Tammi was stood, she winked before dissapearing from view \"Man, no privacy around here\" Cleo said playfully, he shook his head and stood next to her, both of them leaning agains't the fence on the edge of the building \"Why you up here anyway?\" he asked, she shrugged \"I don't know, I like quiet places when I wanna think\" she replied staring out at Seattle \"About what?\" he asked confused \"I don't know I mean usually I'm the girl no one talks to yah know? And now I know when Tara and I walk into school Monday everything's gonna be different somehow, I don't know maybe I'm freaking out over nothing\" she said \"I don't know either, but whatever it is, I'll help you face it, if you'll let me that is\" he said taking her hand in his, she smiled and looked at him \"I would love it. Rockstar\" she replied, he smiled and let go of her hand so he could put his arm around her and pull her closer, she snuggled into his side and held his left hand with hers \"Good choice Rebel\" he whispered, she chuckled.

Not moving. Not breathing. Not thinking. Not alive. He was dead. Or so said the bullet in his skull. Exploded. In the back. Disfiguring his face. In the front. Once beautiful. Now bloody. And dead. And she was above him. Hand and hook in gloves. Up to her elbows. Buried in his chest cavity. Up to her elbows. Fat Boy Slim blared. The room. Tiny. And white. Too small to hear anything. Beside the music. Blares. Drums. Screeches. Imperceivable words. Cut. And spliced sayings. Sentences. And words. California Is Druggy. An Oldie. But a goodie. She dug through blood. Bones. Intestines. And finally. Metal. Retreating with it. She stepped back. Extracting her hand and hook. And stepping on something. Accidentally. With fat legs. Rolling it. It ripped loose. A hose. At his throat. Sucking at his artery. And painted the room. Red. With his blood. It swung convulsively. Dying. Spraying its decay. Until she grabbed its neck. And twisted it off. Getting a face full of blood. His blood. \"Fuck!\" She rubbed at her eyes. With her sleeve. Clamping the convulsing tube with her hook. And dropping it to the ground. Stepping on it. Keeping it down. While it spilled its contents. Pooling on the tiled floor. She wiped at her face. Clearing it from death. His death. She stumbled towards the sink. Flipped it on. And splashed her face. Revealing ugliness. Beneath blood. Disfigurement. Beneath clean death. Her skin was rotten. Burned. Chalky. And flaking. \"Mother fucking...\" she hissed. Clawing at her eyes. Trying to rid them of their pain. She came over. Slapped the corpse. Hard. In the cheek. Whose broken head turned. But made no reaction further. Flipping it off with her finger. The last one she had. Besides clips of bent steal. She stumbled out of the room. \"Don't go anywhere.\" She said to the corpse. \"I'm not done with you. You bloody fuck. I have to take a shit.\" She did so. Squatting. Reaching over for a magazine. Which blared news. That she could not read. Illiterate. Looking at the pictures. Large eyebrows curled. As she saw a picture. On the last page. Of the man. The one she had had her hands in. Just moments before. Up to her elbows. Shitting. But not pissing. She stood. Not flushing. Replaced her clothes. And strode past the sink. Not washing. Out into the office. Dark. And blue. \"Where's the file?\" She rumbled. And the receptionist rolled. Looking up from cleaning her spilt coffee on the floor. Not her fault. Though she suspected she somehow did it. \"What file?\" \"On #01.\" The only body ever transferred here. To the murder unit. Since Precrime was shut down. Three days ago. After six years. The receptionist thumbed. Through files. Folders. Forms. And papers. But came up with nothing. \"Not here.\" \"You know how he died?\" \"Papers say murder.\" Ironically. She stared coldly. At the receptionist. Who went back to mopping. Black coffee coming off the floor. Indifferent to her eyes. \"You fuck.\" She turned. And strode. On fat legs. Back down the hall. \"Have a good day.\" Upon her return. She stopped in the doorway. Mouth agape. Eyes wide. Hooked. Metal hand. Clawing at the doorway. While a blossom of urine stained the front of her dress. Released. The corpse was gone.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER TWO New York City - 2061 She poked at him. \"Hey Mister? Mister?\" He flinched awake. His dark brow furrowing. She poked him again. Waking him. \"Are you alright?\" He opened his eyes. His breath sharp. As he looked at the little girl. Carrying a cat. White. And fluffy. \"Who are you?\" He whispered. His voice so thin. But she didn't hear. \"I thought you were dead.\" \"Why?\" \"You weren't breathing. Plus you smell really bad.\" \"Have I been here long?\" He realized he was on the floor. Propped up against the wall. He remembered this position. \"I brought your cat in. Then I saw your blood. Were you shot?\" She poked at his chest. Her finger in a hole in his shirt. A blossom surrounding it. Her fingertip creating pain. He unbuttoned the top part of his shirt. Pulling it away to blood. And a necklace. Dark. A cross. And blue. \"I don't remember.\" \"Does it hurt?\" She asked. Pulling back her hand. \"Yes.\" He continued to push at his wound. \"Are you on drugs?\" She stood and walked away from him. Grasping the cat. Admiring the room. Fancy pictures. Well furnished. Spacey. Expensive. Apparently. The thought came to him. It was his. \"I don't think so.\" \"I bet you are.\" She dropped the cat. \"Your eyes are all dil-dila- small...\" Her big blue eyes in his. Brown. And dark. She went into the kitchen. Starting to open cupboards. Looking for what she found. Bread. Mayonnaise. And bologna. \"You have the shits?\" \"What?\" \"My mom says that drugs cause you to have the shits.\" \"No. I don't think so.\" \"And she says that a good sandwich can fix the shits. Do you like sandwiches?\" \"I can't remember.\" \"I bet you do.\" She spread the mayonnaise. And piled on the bologna. Coming back over. And giving him the sandwich. \"You look tired. And your skin's all white. Are you tired?\" \"I don't think so.\" He looked down. The cat was licking his fingers. Her lips curled. Her eyebrows dipping. \"You're weird.\" He looked at the sandwich. But didn't feel like eating. \"I bet if I called my mom. She'd fix you. And figure out what's wrong with you.\" Then. To herself. \"I bet it's drugs.\" He sat there. Staring at the cat. Who was now eating his sandwich. Then he looked at an upholstered chair. Some feet away from him. Expensive. While he sat on the floor. \"You want me to call her?\" He looked at her. Not knowing what to say. She shrugged. And went for the board phone. \"How did I get here?\" \"I don't know. You were here when I came here.\" \"How did you get here?\" \"I crawled through your window. You left it unlocked.\" \"I did?\" But she wasn't listening. She was talking. To her mother. He sat there silently. Eyes on the little girl. Not really seeing her. Or hearing her words. Not listening. His mind blank. He didn't see. But he was watching. As she flipped the board phone around. Her mother seeing him. Sitting in the corner. Blood on his shirt. Then flip it back around. And closed it. She turned. \"Are you coming?\" \"To where?\" \"To my house?\" \"Why?\" \"Because my mom says to bring you over.\" \"Alright...\" He still sat there. \"You need help up?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"Then get up.\" \"I can't.\" \"Here.\" She stuck out her hand. But he didn't reach for it. So she picked up his. \"You have to get up to move.\" Looking at her. He pushed himself up. Her pulling. As he rose to his feet. He stumbled. And landed against her. \"Ow! Mister!\" His hand was on her head. While his legs toppled over each other. She shoved him off. And he fell against the wall. Unable to stand without support. He huddled there. Bringing in his arms. A coldness inside of him. One he'd never felt before. It burned so cold. Like metal. \"Come on mister.\" The kid said. Holding out her hand once more. But still. He didn't reach out to take it. She grabbing his. He followed on tottering legs. Towards the door. She paused. \"Do you have a real car? Those [autos] are so boring.\" \"I don't remember.\" \"I bet you do! You're rich enough to!\" She pulled him out the door. And stopped at the driveway. Licking her lips at the automobile. A Lexus. Silver. With cherry red siding. Brilliant. And shining. \"Oh wow!\" She let got of his hand. And he stood there. Feeling nothing. Looking at the car. Apparently his. \"This is so cool!\" She reached out and touched it. Running her hand over the hood. His palm smoothing along metal silk. Cherry red. And silver. \"Get in!\" She cried. Opening the passenger door. And climbing inside. He did so. She bouncing in the cushioned chair. Her eyes wide. Roving over buttons. \"I've never been in one of these.\" He sat silently. She looked to him. But he did nothing. \"Can you drive?\" \"I don't remember.\" She looked in the back. Seeing his coat. Folded in the seat. \"Your coat's here. So obviously you did.\" He put his hands on the wheel. Noticing. For the first time. The black brace on his left hand. He looked at it. \"Did you hurt yourself?\" \"I don't remember.\" \"You don't remember a lot of stuff do you?\" \"I guess not.\" \"Please say you remember how to drive though.\" \"I don't think I can.\" \"Dammnit.\" She crossed her arms. \"Can you drive?\" She turned. \"Are you kidding? I'm only six.\" She threw her head back into the seat. Sighing hard. After a moment. She hit the door open. Mad. \"Come on.\" \"Where are we going now?\" \"To my house.\" She started down the path. And he almost followed. Until she turned around. \"Get your coat.\" \"Why?\" \"Because our walk's going to be cold.\" She said. Miffed. He grabbed for his coat. Got out of the car. Put it on. Buttoned it up. And felt a strange bulge in his chest pocket. Reaching in. He plucked out a pair of glasses. Black. Thin framed. \"Do I wear glasses?\" \"What kind of question is that?\" She was halfway down the path. Walking fast. \"I can't remember if I do.\" He followed. Examining them. \"Can you see right now?\" She turned. And stopped. Waiting for him to catch up. \"Yes.\" \"Then you don't.\" \"Then why are they in my pocket?\" \"I don't know. Put them on.\" He did so. \"Can you see me?\" He saw her with crisp clarity. She waved her hand. \"Yes.\" \"Better?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I guess you do.\" She turned. And began walking again.[Chapter 3] --- CHAPTER THREE --- Her arms were crossed. Her legs shuffling. The bottom of her pants soaked. From the puddles. Too big to go around. Her teeth were chattering. Condensed air smoking from her mouth. \"Are you cold?\" He asked. She didn't turn to him. \"No.\" She lied. Through chattering teeth. And shivering body. He looked at her. Keeping by her side. Watching her. Shake more and more. By the minute. Growing colder. Through more puddles. Dark. And blue. \"I can carry you.\" He offered. And she turned to him. \"Nobody carries me.\" She turned away. And kept walking. He beside her. Soon. He didn't have to strain to hear her teeth. And see her shake. He swooped over. And picked her up. Bundling her into his arms. Against his chest. Pulling her beneath his jacket. \"You are cold.\" \"I know.\" She confessed. Through chattering teeth. And shivering body. Feeling his warmth. Her cold forehead. Pressed against his warm neck. They walked on. Through the alley. He stepping in the puddles. Getting cold. Not her. ~ Up a long path. To a large barn house. Rustic. And simple. \"We're home!\" She jumped from his arms. And ran up to the door. She tried to open it. But found it locked. She pounded on the door. The man coming to join her on the porch. Suddenly. They could hear a voice. And the door was unlocked. Then opened. A woman. Skinny. Tall. Homely dressed. And pretty answered. She hesitated though. Her face falling. Upon sight of the man. She crossed her arms. Her face folding. Her eyes questioning. \"What are you doing with him...?\" She looked down. Saw her daughter. Smiling up. \"Hi mom.\" The little girl said. Squeezing past. Into the house. Leaving him. Alone on the step. Cold. He just looked at her. Unsure. She examined his face for a while. Her eyes reading him. He shifted uncomfortably. Feet wet. She looked down. To the ground. Playing with the edge of the door. With her shoe. Arching her foot. Clapping it on and off. Indecisive. Suddenly. The little girl was back. Munching through a box of cereal. The box singing. \"What's wrong?\" Both turned to her. Crunching away. \"Aren't you going to let him in? It's cold outside mom.\" Clearing her throat. \"Nothing baby. Nothing's wrong.\" The woman stepped back. Letting him step in. \"Come in.\" She forced a smile. Reluctantly. He stepped in. Reluctantly. Only moving so she could shut the door. Then he stood there. The woman turned down to her daughter. Noticing her purple hands. Cold. \"Where are your gloves?\" The little girl smiled widely. Splitting to her ears. \"I gave them to Nikky.\" Her friend. \"Why?\" \"Because it was in her best interest.\" \"Is that so?\" The woman smiled. Coyly. Reaching out her hands to grab up the little girl. Who screamed. And dropped the box. Scattering cereal. Laughing hysterically. As fingers tickled her. Letting her down. The girl ran off. Disappearing in the kitchen. \"This is going to seem like a silly question.\" The woman paused. Palming her elbow. \"Are you Danny Witwer?\" He looked at her blankly. Then. After searching his mind. Shook his head slowly. She put a hand to her chest. Her face broke. \"You look like him.\" Smiling embarrassingly. She shifted slightly. \"Can I take your coat?\" \"Who's Danny Witwer?\" He asked. He looked at it. Then unshouldered it. Handing it over to her. \"Someone who worked for the government.\" She smiled and took it to the closet. Coming back. \"He was killed. A while ago--. I guess that's rather silly, isn't it?\" She bit her lower lip. Then noticed the blood stain on his shirt. \"Oh my god. Are you alright?\" She came forward. Holding her hands toward the crimson bloom. But didn't touch. Her face worried. \"I think so.\" He answered. Looking towards his chest. There was pain. But not enough to cause him grief. \"He's on drugs.\" The little girl passed by. Pulling her lips up from a straw. Dark. And blue. Stuck in a carton of chocolate milk. The woman turned an eye to the girl. \"Agatha....\" she scorned. But turned back to the man's smile. Soft. And sweet. Finding the humor. \"Why don't you let me take a look at that?\" She reached out for his hand. And taking his. Led him into the back room. He followed. Without protest. She led him through the house. Expansive. And homely. Into a room. Of black and white pictures. Some framed in black. Others in wood. All black. And white. All absolutely stunning. An old man. A swing set. A beach. A crack in the cement. Gorgeous. \"So where do you come from?\" \"I don't know.\" Her brow furrowed. \"You don't know where you came from?\" \"No. My house?\" She had him sit down on a chair. And he did. His eyes on the pictures. Admiring them. She put her hand across his forehead. He looked up at her. Without moving his head. \"You're warm, but you don't have a fever,\" She smiled. \"What's your name?\" \"I don't know.\" He coughed. She flinched. \"You're bleeding.\" She reached over. And handed him a towel. He wiped at the blood. \"Did you fall?\" Guessing a concussion. She felt his head again. But felt no bumps. Nor tenderness. \"I don't remember.\" \"That's strange...\" She spoke. Kneeling in front of him. \"You don't mind do you?\" Her hands were at the buttons of his shirt. \"I use to be a nurse.\" He shook his head. Then looked at the pictures. \"Did you take all these?\" She looked around to the pictures. \"I did.\" \"I like them.\" She stopped. And looked up at him. Surprise in her eyes. \"What's wrong?\" She faltered. Before shaking her head. \"Nothing. It's just that...that's exactly what Danny said.\" He just looked at her. \"Are you sure you're not. At least. Related to him?\" \"I don't know.\" She tested it. \"What do you take in your coffee?\" \"I can't remember.\" Abandoning the idea. She went back to her work. Finishing unbuttoning. And pulling his shirt back. Letting him take it off. It revealed bruises. Bleeding wounds. And tattoos. She worked quietly. Him watching. As she cleaned up the blood. And dressed the wounds. Admiring the tattoos. \"These are nice.\" He looked at them. Holding the expression that this was the first time he'd seen them. Ever. One on his forearm. One on his shoulder. She looked at the brace on his wrist. Then paused for another time. She started to step away. \"It doesn't make sense.\" \"What doesn't?\" He asked. Watching her. Concerned. \"Danny wore the same thing when he was...shot.\" She put a hand over her mouth. And stood. Pacing the room. Looking at him then up at the ceiling. Then. She stopped. And stuck out a hand. \"Please,\" she whispered. \"I don't - I don't want this to sound rude but. Could you just - just wait outside until my husband gets home?\" \"Sure.\" He put his shirt back on. Then stood. Following her as she went back out to the door. She grabbed his coat from the closet. And gave it to him. Opening the door. He stepped out. Turning to face her. Her daughter was soon at her leg. \"What's wrong?\" But with one last look. She shut the door. The man stood there for a time. Before the wind got to him. Then he put on his jacket. And sat down. Waiting.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER FOUR \"Hi Mister.\" He looked up from his knees. His arm clutched about him. Freezing. His wet pant legs. Heavy with ice. The little girl wore a coat. A hat. And carried a blanket. She handed it to him. \"Thank you.\" He put it on. Over his knees. Dark. And Blue. \"Mom doesn't know I'm out here.\" The girl sat down beside him. And looked at him. He was looking at the ground. \"So I can't stay long.\" \"Oh yeah.\" She reached into her pocket. And pulled out a sandwich. Wrapped in plastic. \"I made this for you.\" The jelly tore the bread. The peanut butter kept it together. \"It's my favorite kind.\" She handed it over. He looked at it. But didn't feel like eating. \"I should probably go...\" but her words trailed off. As a Lexus pulled up. Much like his. But darker. And running. \"Daddy!\" The girl leapt up. And ran off the porch. \"Daddy's home!\" A man got out. Short. Burly. Shaved head. He snatched up the girl. And gave her a kiss. Big and messy. The little girl laughed. High. And giggling. The man carried the girl. The man on the porch did not move. Watching from the shadows. \"Dad! You'll never guess what I found today...\" but the man stopped. One foot on the step of the porch. Stricken. Slowly. He let the girl down. \"Go inside.\" \"But dad...\" the girl was confused. \"Go. Now.\" the man said. Sternly. Doing little more than raising an arm. His face on the man. On the porch. Clutched by the shadows. Blanket on the ground. As he stood there. \"Daddy...\" she hooked. Both men's eyes rolled on her. She looked back and forth. Her dad conceding. \"Agatha. Go.\" There was no room for courtesy. A frown crossed her face. Her arms went about her chest. And she stomped through the front door. \"Who are you. What are you doing here?\" The man was confused. As the woman had been. But more upset. \"I came with her...\" the man spoke quietly. Pointing to where the girl had been. The dad looked suddenly angry. \"Who are you?\" \"I don't know...\" The dad came fast up onto the porch. Reaching out. Taking the man by the throat. Shoving him against the banister. Shining light on the man's face. Anyone today. Could be a threat. People were still mad. That he'd killed him. The father of Precrime. People had been outraged. They didn't know the truth. Then the dad's face fell. \"What the fu-?...\" he shook his head. \"Witwer...?\" The man shook his head. As mush as he could. \"Your wife called me that.\" \"You talked to my wife?\" The dad was angry again. \"Yes.\" He touched noses. \"I don't know what the hell you're trying to pull. But I want you to stay the fuck away from my family.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you're dead. You hear me? You're dead.\" \"I'm not dead.\" It seemed impervious. The way he said it. The dad squinted. Hard. A crease in his brow. Hate was there. Pressing that crease. The man soon found. A knee in his belly. He doubled over. Coughing. \"You're dead.\" The dad was saying. The knee hurt worse. Because of the bullet wound. \"What's your name?\" The dad kicked him in the chest. Beneath his arm. \"I don't know.\" The dad kicked his face. \"What's your name?\" \"I don't know.\" Through blood. \"What's your name!? Who sent you?!\" \"I don't know. I don't know.\" \"What are you doing here? Who sent you? Who remade you? Why are you alive? You're suppose to be dead. Why aren't you dead?\" Each question. Followed by a kick. Each kick. Followed by the same. \"I don't know.\" \"Fight back you son of the bitch!\" The man lay curled. Jerked around pain. The dad grabbed him by the coat. Lifting him. And throwing him against the wall. But the man would not fight back. \"Fight back!\" The dad punched him. Fists pelting. His cheeks. The blood. Splashing. Flying. Until words cut in. \"John! What are you doing?!\" Hands grabbed for fists. Had trouble. Then stopped them. The man crumpled. Hugging his knees. Afraid. Crying. \"What'd you do. Daddy?\" The little girl. Looking to the crumpled man. Face bloody. Then to her father. Knuckles bloody. The dad fell slack. The crumpled man shook. The little girl stared. \"Come inside.\" The woman coaxed. Pulling her husband. And daughter. Into the house. Closing it behind them. Leaving the crumpled man.[Chapter 5] you have no idea how much this means to me. thank you so much, i wish i could give you all a big hug!! CHAPTER FIVE \"Don't cry mister.\" The little girl was there again. A tiny hand reaching through his arms. To pick up his face. He wiped at the blood. And the tears. With his coat sleeve. \"You're alright.\" She said. Touching his shoulder. \"Daddy was just mad.\" She put out a hand. And he looked at it. Sighing with a smile. She took his. And helped him up. Pulling him to his feet. Heavily using the side of the house. She led him to the bench. On the edge of the porch. And let him sit down. The pain hurt. A lot. \"He doesn't hate you. Don't cry.\" She drew the blanket over his shoulders. Climbing up onto the seat. She stood there. Looking at him for a long while. Until he stopped crying. Reaching into her coat pocket. She pulled out some tissues. And blotted at his face. Cleaning away the blood. He sat silently. Looking at her. Her little hand on his shoulder. For support. \"There.\" She rocked back. Standing tall. Looking at her cleanup. \"All better.\" Then. Seeing the tears still in his eyes. She leaned forward. And hugged him. \"He didn't mean to hurt you.\" She spoke softly. Crunching him in her tiny arms. \"He was just mad. And scared.\" \"Why aren't you scared?\" The man spoke. Wiping at new wetness. Beneath his nose. Blood. \"Because you're a good person.\" She smiled as she sat back. \"I can tell.\" \"Here.\" She took a fresh tissue. Held it against his nose. \"Did you know your snot runs down your throat?\" The man shook his head. \"I learned it from Nikky. She's almost a month older than me.\" \"How old are you?\" She asked. Pinching his nose. \"Wait.\" Before he could speak. \"You don't know. Do you?\" He shook his head. She took the tissue from his nose. Sighing. Looking at it. Rumpled and red. His nose stopped bleeding. \"Daddy said you were dead. Is that true?\" \"I don't know.\" Tears came forward. An emotion he almost didn't like. But it felt good. Heating his eyes. The rest of him cold. Digging beneath his coat. Then his half-open shirt. She put her little palm against his chest. Then. Took up his hand. He looked down. Through his open shirt. To bruises. Dark. And blue. As she put his own hand against his chest. \"Feel anything?\" \"No.\" Frowning. She removed his hand. Then. Leaned down. And put her ear against him. He was surprised at how warm she was. He began to reach up. To touch her little hooded head. When she moved. \"There!\" She replaced her ear with her finger. Then his hand again. \"There it is!\" Excited. \"Do you feel it now?\" He waited. Then felt the dull thump. And counter thump. \"Yes.\" \"It's pretty huh?\" She smiled. \"You're not dead.\" \"It's beautiful...\" he said quietly. She sat down. Took his other arm. And draped it over her shoulder. Leaning into him. He looked down at her. And she looked at the front door. \"I like you. You're different.\" \"I like you.\" He said. But didn't smile. She looked up. And she smiled. Suddenly. She reached up. And plucked at his nose. \"Got your nose.\" She dropped her hand. Wiggling her thumb. Sticking up between her fingers. Beaming. \"That's your thumb.\" \"I know.\" Her smile fell. \"It's a dumb trick.\" She undid her hand. Looking at it. \"But dad use to do it all the time to me. It made me feel better.\" She looked up at him. The smile gone. \"Do you feel better?\" He took a breath. \"No.\" The pain still hurt. And his eyes were still warm. Her little face twisted. She licked her lips. Little tongue. \"I better go back inside.\" She finally said. \"Mom and dad will wonder where I am.\" She shook herself off the seat. And went to the side of the porch. Before she disappeared though. She turned. And smiled. And waved. The man waved back. The front door opened. The woman stood there. Clutched about herself. She cleared her throat. Wrapped in a long sweater. A wad of Kleenex in her fist. Her face was red. And her thin neck. Was stretched. Like she'd been yelling. Straining. He rose up. Faltered with a hand to his chest. Before standing fully. \"My husband apologizes for what he did.\" She was almost sad. Looking at him. Pathetic. Hurt. Like a dog in the rain. The man just looked at her. Cold. Alone. \"You should go home.\" The woman said. \"It would be best.\" Wide palming his wounds. Feeling the tenderness at his chest. He turned. Looking out from the porch. To the night. Dark. And blue. The rain had begun again. Drizzling. Lapping puddles. He stepped out. Down the steps. Into the rain. With his presence. The rain turned hard. Slashing. Like chewing teeth. Turning the asphalt to mush. And puddles to fusillades. H e stood still. Blinking. Looking. Not knowing. He didn't know where home was. So he stood there. Sad again. He didn't like it. Not remembering. The woman refused to stray from the doorway. \"You need to go home.\" She spoke again. Like to a little child. Whose visit had now ended. \"I don't know where home is.\" He spoke softly. He turned back. A tear falling. Gold against the silver rain. And she had to squeeze her face. To keep from doing the same. His face peach. The peach bruised. There was a long silence. Awkward. The man stood. And stared. The woman twisted. And thought. And fretted. \"If you'd accept.\" She turned behind her. Looking back. Apprehensively. Before looking out again. \"We can give you a room here. For tonight. As an apology.\" The little girl came trotting up. Looking at the man. Smiling. He smiled back. The woman looked down to her daughter. And stepped in front of her. Protecting her. From a violence that wasn't there. An emotion that wasn't there. A mistrust that shouldn't be there. He looked up at the woman. She swallowed. Her eyes red. From crying. As he had been. \"Will you accept?\" She stood like stone. He nodded slowly. Shaking in the cold. Wet. Rain. She stepped onto the porch. Her daughter following. As she took up the dropped blanket. \"Come in out of the rain.\" She said. Soft. He hesitated. Before he did. Coming up. She handed him the blanket. He pulled it around him. The woman turned back inside. Her daughter following. Smiling back at the man. The man followed them. Smiling back at the little girl.[Chapter 6] Alex, Bookbinder's Daughter, Conookie, Jenni, and SpadesJade...goddamn i love you guys and you never cease to impress me! *big hugs!* CHAPTER SIX He lay silent. Listening down the hall. The argument. Over the situation. Over him. The family. All three. Had moved to one room. Door locked. But only the little girl was in the room now. The parents were downstairs. Yelling. From the kitchen. The man could hear it through the vent. He moved. And the springs in the futon squealed. Drowning out the words. He did not want to hear them. He rose. The blankets coming off. As he stood. And went for the bathroom. Down the hall. But at the bedroom door. He stopped. The one with the girl behind it. He stopped. And put his ear against the door. It was silent inside. He tapped gently. With his knuckle. And he heard the bed springs creek. Muffled feet shuffling. Across the carpet. Coming towards the door. \"Hello?\" She asked. Her hands against the door. Her ear pressed against the wood. Listening to him breathe. \"Hi.\" He said. \"We have to be quiet.\" She warned. Looking towards the vent. Not wanting to be caught. \"Okay.\" he answered. And squatted down. To her level. His palm about where hers was spread. On the other side of the door. \"Are they keeping you awake?\" she spoke. Then bit off her own words. \"Wait. Knock once for yes. Twice for no.\" He knocked once. \"Me too.\" She whispered. Smelling the varnish. Old. And faded. She sighed. And fell against the wood. Liking it. Loving it. Feeling its warmth. She giggled. \"Can you guess what this is?\" She knocked. Pausing. Two knocks. Pause. Knock. He knocked twice. \"I don't know either.\" She smiled. And laughed quietly. At her trick. \"I made it up.\" Then. She resumed. \"How 'bout this one?\" Seven Knocks. Pause. Three knocks. Pause. Three knocks. Thirteen knocks. End. He knocked twice. \"It's 'Mary had a Little Lamb'.\" She said. Pulling back her hand. Looking at her fist. \"It's really old.\" There was silence for a moment. Even from the kitchen. They were coming. \"Will you stay here?\" She asked. Pausing. He knocked twice. \"Why not?\" He looked down his borrowed pajamas. Dark. And blue. To his chest. Where bruises were. He looked at the door. Imagining what her face looked like. \"Please stay,\" she whimpered softly, \"with me?\" He waited for a long time. Just as he heard feet. Coming up the stairs. \"I like you...\" And as he rose up from the door. He gave it one soft knock.[Chapter 7] i just felt all tickly good tonight and decided to update. hope you don't mind... CHAPTER SEVEN \"Hello,\" he spoke. Hands behind his back. As he approached the clothesline. The clipped sheets blowing. Wet shirts drying. Glowing in the sun. Beautiful. \"Hello.\" The woman smiled. Polite. Held back. Hugging tight one of the rolled blankets. Taking the pins from her lips. \"Hi!\" Agatha came from behind a sheet. Hitting it away. As it tried to wrap around her. He smiled at the little girl. Then looked to the woman. \"Could you hear us last night?\" She was worried. He nodded. \"I'm sorry.\" She said. Quietly. Putting the rolled blanket. Into a basket beside her. \"We didn't mean to be so loud. It's just - \" she looked at his eyes. And her explanation ended. \"You kept crying out in your sleep, I could hear you down the hall...do you remember what the dream was?\" The man shook his head. \"Are you alright from last night?\" \"I think so.\" His palm went to his chest. Finding pain. His head. Finding bruises. \"He didn't hurt you too bad, did he? He really didn't mean to...it was dark and it'd been a long day...\" she was lost in thought. Thinking out loud. \"...I know that's no excuse for it, there shouldn't be, but -\" She looked up. Seeing him stare at her. His head tilted. Blinking slowly. He didn't care. \"We should take you to a doctor.\" She said. Returning to the line. Pulling clips. \"I would help you but I don't think my husband -\" He was still just looking at her. The man blinked. Then looked at the line. \"Were these here all night?\" The man asked. Looking at the sheets. And shirts. They looked wet. \"Yes,\" the woman smiled. Rolling another sheet. \"It's still damp. But they smell better, see? \" She held it up. And he leaned down into it. Closing his eyes. Breathing it in. \"You're right.\" He said. Leaning back. Liking the smell. The woman brought it up. And sniffed it again. To see if it had changed. Then smiled slightly. And put it in the basket. He looked down to the sheets. \"Do you need help?\" She looked to the basket. Then back to him. \"No, no thanks...\" \"I can take you into the city later today.\" She broke. \"Maybe you'll remember something.\" \"That'd be nice.\" He said. Quiet. Looking towards the house. It's sides gleaming in the sun. \"Can we go to the park?\" Agatha asked. Sliding into the talk. \"Sweetie,\" the woman began. But her daughter's pouting face. Stopped her. \"Please mom? Pleeeeeeaaaaazzzzzz?\" \"Is that alright?\" She turned to the man. His eyes never left hers. And he nodded. \"Alright,\" she said. \"after we take uh - I'm sorry, I don't know what to call you.\" She looked at the man. He just looked back. \"Can we name him Catcher?\" Agatha asked. Jumping up and down. \"Nikky has a dog named Catcher and he's really ugly, I think he was shut in the door or something when he was a puppy, so that name is wasted on him.\" \"Agatha.\" The woman reprimanded. The woman laughed apologetically. Crossing her arms. \"Honey, we can't give him a name. He's a human, not a dog.\" She turned to him. She smiled adjustingly. And he just smiled. \"Oh come on, mom. It's a good name!\" \"It's fine with me.\" The man spoke. The woman looked up. Surprised. \"Are you joking?\" \"Should I?\" he asked slowly. \"No,\" the woman half smiled. Perplexed. \"I just...\" He raised an eyebrow. And finally the smile broke loose. On her face. \"Fine then. We'll call you Catcher...\" \"Hi Catcher,\" the little girl tugged on his shirt. \"I'm Agatha.\" She smiled wide. As \"Catcher\" leaned down. \"Hi Agatha,\" he took her outstretched hand. And kissed it gently. \"I'm Catcher...\" The little girl blushed. \"This is Lara, my mom.\" The little girl motioned up to her mother. Taking the attention off herself. Her rosy cheeks shining. \"Hello Lara,\" Catcher rose to his feet. Taking her hand. \"I'm Catcher.\" The woman smiled. And shook her head. But he bent down. And kissed her hand. Anyway. Her cheeks turned pink. She pulled her hand away. And cleared her throat. To try and dispose of the smile. Going back to the clothesline. \"See mom?\" the little girl went up next to Lara. \"I told you he was nice.\" \"We've got a real gentleman here Agatha.\" The woman said softly. Rubbing her daughter's hair. \"We better watch ourselves.\"[Chapter 8] CHAPTER EIGHT - THE CRAYON \"Mom would have a fit if she knew you were in here.\" Her crayon never went outside the lines. \"Do you want me to leave?\" He was lying on his back. Facing the ceiling. Something like a dull ache. Was eating his chest. \"No.\" She said. Dropping the red crayon. Picking up the green one. She flipped the paper around. Her tongue coming out. From between her lips. Helping her color. \"Have you ever been to a doctor before?\" Agatha asked. Head tilted. \"No, does it hurt?\" His eyes went to the girl's back. She sighed. But didn't look at him. \"Sometimes. Depends on what they do...\" \"I don't want it to hurt.\" Agatha sat up. Turning around. Before coming towards him. She crawled up onto the bed. On her hands and knees. Over his head. Looking at him. \"I won't let it. I promise.\" His mouth twitched. She squinted. Then leaned in close. Looking hard. \"You have two different colored eyes.\" She said. \"I do?\" \"Uh huh, this one's darker.\" She pointed to his left one. With the tip of her crayon. \"That comes from inbreeding, you know.\" \"What's \"inbreeding\"?\" She shook her head. \"I don't know. But I bet it's bad.\" She backed off. And sat on the other side of the bed. Facing the wall now. There was silence for a moment. \"Do you get mad?\" \"About what?\" \"About not remembering things.\" She turned back to him. And he turned over. Onto his belly. \"Sometimes.\" \"How come you don't express it?\" \"I don't know how.\" \"You could stomp your foot, or yell, or something.\" She looked to her crayon. \"When I was little, I use to try and color on things, but look,\" she reached out. And touched the tip to his arm. It made a negative sound. And made no streak. \"It doesn't work on anything but paper.\" \"Does that make you mad?\" \"Yeah, sometimes I really want to draw all over everything.\" \"Why?\" \"To make the world prettier.\" She sighed. Sadly. And looked out the window. \"To make me feel better.\" \"Are you sick?\" He got up. Came around. And sat down next to her. That pain. Fading slightly. When he was near her. \"No,\" she looked at him. \"It's not like that.\" \"What's it like then?\" \"It's like...I feel sad inside and I don't know why.\" She reached out. And took his arm. Leaning against him. \"But I don't feel sad when you're here, you make me feel good.\" He looked down at her. And after a moment. She looked up. \"Do I make you feel good?\" \"You make my heart stop hurting.\" He said. Slowly. And she frowned at him. Her little eyebrows furrowing. \"Is it cause of your wound?\" She asked. Knowing it had never been covered. \"No, it hurts deeper.\" \"When does your heart hurt?\" \"All the time...\" \"That's not good Catcher,\" she reached up. And put her hand against his chest. \"You should watch that.\"[Chapter 9] CHAPTER NINE - THE CITY \"Have a nice day Anderton family and companion.\" The [auto] chirped. As they stepped out. Into the bustling hustle. Of the city. Washington D.C. The old buildings. The past. Rotting. And gray. The new buildings. The future. Gleaming. And silver. So close to each other. Yet so far away. As well. \"Wow.\" Catcher saw the world. For the very first time. Leaning back. Looking at the buildings. \"Pretty huh?\" Agatha asked. Holding her mother's hand. \"It's beautiful.\" He'd said that before. About his own heartbeat. \"Come on!\" Agatha called. Some ways up the walk. Her mother pulling. Catcher rushed to catch up. Walking with them. As they hit the sidewalks. Merging into the crowds. A sea of people. He had to stop. To look at them all. All sorts of people. Amazing people. Ordinary people. Fat people. Skinny people. Tall. Short. Strange. Normal. In couples. Alone. Talking on phones. Talking to themselves. Not talking. Carrying bags. Not carrying bags. Walking dogs. Not walking dogs. Living. He watched them all. As they passed by. \"Excuse me.\" They'd say. \"Pardon me.\" When they'd brush his shoulder. Some sternly. Some compassionately. He watched them all. Smiling. He looked down. But saw no one he recognized. His smile fell. The bustle went by. With him in the middle. Motionless. He looked to the left. No one. He looked to the right. No one. His heart sped up. The faces weren't familiar. He didn't recognize them. They didn't look friendly. Where were they? \"Catcher!\" Agatha called below the living sea. \"Agatha! Come back!\" Lara called from behind. Agatha ran to him. \"Come on Catcher,\" she smiled up. \"We're getting lunch.\" She took him by the hand. And led him back towards her mom. Once together. Again. They made their way through the crowd. Agatha holding his hand. They turned into a diner. Stuck between two bigger buildings. Nothing greeted them. Lara looked up. Seeing no scanner. Anywhere. A woman went by. Big black hair. Poofy. She wore a checkered dress. And went about on roller-skates. She had a notepad in her hand. The theme was a 70's diner. \"Michelle\" was on her nametag. \"How you doin' sweetcheeks?\" New York accent. Michelle, the waitress, snapped her gum. Looking at Catcher. Before turning to Agatha. \"Darlin'?\" Greeting her. Then to Lara. \"Ma'am. Three of you?\" Lara nodded. The waitress led them back to a table. And sat them down. Lara and Agatha on one side. Catcher on the other. \"Can I get you anything to drink?\" The waitress asked. Handing out menus. \"Iced tea.\" Lara said. \"Milk.\" Agatha said smiling. \"Same.\" Catcher agreed. The waitress left. And Catcher leaned over the menu. Lara watching him intently. \"Do you remember anything yet?\" She asked. And he looked up. \"No.\" \"Nothing at all?\" \"Nothing.\" Catcher assured. There was a pause. Lara leaned back. \"I have to use the restroom,\" she turned to her daughter, \"do you?\" \"Nope.\" Agatha said. Also looking over the menu. \"Are you sure?\" \"Mhm.\" She didn't look up from the menu. As her mother left. Just as he disappeared. Into the bathroom. The drinks came. \"One iced tea.\" She set at the empty spot. Then reached over and set down Agatha's tumbler. \"One milk.\" \"And another milk for slick.\" She winked at Catcher. As she set the tumbler down. Dark. And blue. \"You want to order now?\" \"Can I have a grilled cheese sandwich, please?\" Agatha asked. Michelle jotted it down. \"You?\" She turned to Catcher. He shook his head. \"You have to eat something or you'll get sick.\" Agatha commented. Drawing a finger over her menu. \"He'll have a grilled cheese sandwich too please.\" \"So two grilled cheese sandwiches?\" \"Yup.\" Agatha set the menu down. \"And what about her?\" \"She'll have a salad with Ranch on the side.\" Agatha folded her hands. Looking at Catcher smiling. Who was looking at the waitress. Staring. Who was looking at him. Picking up the menus. \"She likes you.\" Agatha whispered. As the waitress rolled away. Leaning over the table. Her chin in her crossed wrists. \"You think?\" Catcher watched her go. Agatha sat up. And nodded. \"Do you like her?\" Putting her lips down on the straw. \"No.\" \"Good.\" Agatha preferred. Blowing into her milk. The bubbles sprung up. Making a popping noise. Catcher looked at her. Amused. \"Try it.\" She suggested. Putting her lips down. And doing it again. He did so. And the bubbles exploded in his cup. Soon. It became a contest. Each one blowing their hardest. Until finally. Agatha leaned back. Puffed up her chest. And blew with all her might. The milk ruptured onto her face. And she shook with laughter. Clutching at her sides. Catcher laughed too. Until Agatha's face fell. \"Mom's coming!\" Agatha rose the alarm. And they both set into action. Mopping up the milk. Using sleeves. Napkins. Anything they could. Her mother rounded the corner. But got stuck behind a man with a large tray. Buying them time. \"Where do these go?!\" Agatha held a wad of soppy napkins. \"Here,\" Catcher put out his hand. Took them. And shoved them into his coat pocket. Finishing. They both sat back. As Lara sat down. \"Hi mom.\" Agatha squeezed out her smile. Covering it with her hands. \"What?\" She looked at Agatha. Then Catcher. Who only shrugged. She glowered at them both. Then the food came. Michelle bringing it. She set it down without talking. Then left. Leaving the bill. And looking one last time at Catcher. \"I told you.\" Agatha whispered to him. Smiling. She began peeling her sandwich apart. Catcher watched her. \"I don't like crust. I'm allergic to it.\" She explained. \"You are not allergic to it.\" \"Am too! Look!\" she raised her wrist. And peeled back the Band-Aid. Revealing a healing scrape. \"I'm getting a rash. Allergic things give you rash.\" \"Agatha, that's when you fell off your bike. And you're not allergic to crust, you just don't like it. \"That's what I said!\" She finished skinning the bread. Smiling deviously. Catcher looked down to his own plate. Fingering the crust. Tipping up the sandwich. \"You should eat yours though, it's good for you.\" Agatha said through her first bite. \"Grilled cheese is my favorite.\" \"I thought peanut butter and jelly was.\" Catcher countered. \"I like a lot of sandwiches.\" Agatha took another big bite. Nodding respectfully. \"Don't talk with your mouth full.\" Lara warned. And turned away. Agatha flashed her a mouthful of cheese and bread. All chewed up to mush. Then closed it before she could see. After that. Their meal was quiet. Catcher and Agatha flicking smiles at each other. All throughout it. Till Lara caught them. And made them stop. With just one look. Agatha finished off her sandwich. \"Done!\" she announced. Lara was still poking her salad. And Catcher had barely eaten one half of his sandwich. \"We're not.\" Lara said. Pulling out a beet. Eating it with a crunch. Glaring her down. Before smiling. Agatha slumped down her chair. A frown on her face. Then the boredom came. Her arms crossed about her. Waiting impatiently. Sighing every few seconds. Lara quietly ate her salad. Occasionally glancing up at Catcher. Who was poking at the remaining half of his sandwich. Then he looked up to Agatha. Suddenly. And she smiled. Obviously pleased. His face frowned. As he moved his feet beneath the table. Stepping on her toes. Sliding off. Because hers weren't long enough. To touch the floor. She stepped on his feet. A good step too. He pulled back. And stepped on hers. Sliding off. She stepped on his. He stepped on hers. \"Foot WARS!!\" Agatha screamed. Half the restaurant turning. Watching as they went at it. Agatha began to kick. Catcher kicked back. Stomping their feet on top of each other's. Bruising mostly his toes. She kicked hard. It started small. Like the milk bubbles had. Until the table shook. And as an end. Lara's half drunk iced tea. Bounced once. And spilled. Right onto her lap. \"Agatha! Catcher!\" she reproached them both. Surprised at the coldness. As it touched her legs. \"Behave yourselves!\" She wiped desperately at the dark blossom. Using her napkin. Agatha only laughed. Behind her hand. And Catcher couldn't hide the wide smile.[Chapter 10] CHAPTER TEN - THE DOCTOR The door rang. As they came through. The eye scanner. Scanning eyes. In order. First name basis. To make them feel more at home. \"Hello Agatha. Hello Lara. Helloooo...o.ooo...ooo...oo..o...\" Laura flashed a glance to Catcher. Her breath caught in her throat. Worried. He was looking at Agatha. And quickly. Lara put her hand out. Hanging onto her. Then she heard the receptionist shuffle. \"Oh that silly thing.\" The receptionist came around. Bringing a chair with her. Setting it up. She stood atop it. And started smacking the scanner. With her hand. \"It's been like that forever now. I keep telling the doctor to fix it.\" \"hhh...h.h.h....h.h...hHH...Hello Ms. McClouch.\" It chirped. As it scanned the receptionist's eye. Lara let out her pent breath. \"Ow. Mom, you're hurting my shoulder.\" Lara let go. \"We're here for Catcher...I called yesterday...\" Lara went to the counter. With the receptionist. Agatha stayed behind. And sat down beside Catcher. \"Do you like your new name?\" Agatha asked. He thought about it for a moment. Then nodded. \"Is it better than your old name?\" \"I don't remember my old name.\" \"Do you like it better then?\" \"I guess.\" He turned to her. \"Do you like yours?\" She scrunched up her face. \"Not really. Dad says I was named after someone very important though.\" \"Do you know who?\" \"Agatha obviously.\" She smirked. Rummaging through the magazines. That scanned her eyes. And called her name. \"What name would you rather have?\" \"I don't know. Something good though.\" Lara came back and sat down. Looking at the stain on her skirt. \"Mr. Catcher?\" A large doctor lumbered in. Immediately. Quintessential. In a white coat. With a handlebar mustache. His words were gentle. As he probably was. Catcher got up. So did Lara. So did Agatha. But her mother caught her. \"You stay out here.\" \"Why?\" Agatha asked. \"You can play with a game.\" \"Games are for babies.\" Agatha stamped. \"I want to come with you.\" The doctor chuckled. \"She's welcome to come in.\" He smiled. \"It's just a routine exam, nothing to keep her from.\" He guided Agatha by the shoulder. When she went past. Lara followed. Then Catcher. Down the hall. First door on the right. They went in. And the door was closed behind them. \"Up here if you will sir.\" The doctor patted the table. And Catcher got up. Looking nervous. For the first time. The doctor looked closely at his face. \"What happened here?\" The doctor asked. Pulling on some rubber gloves. Catcher turned to Lara. \"He got into a fight.\" Lara answered for him. \"He lost.\" Agatha announced. The doctor chuckled. His gloved hands on Catcher's face. Gently poking. Catcher winced. \"Well, there's nothing here that won't heal.\" \"What's this then?\" he looked down at the brace. Still around Catcher's wrist. No one said anything. The doctor picked it up. Looked at it. Then began to take it off. Moving his wrist. He asked questions. Turning it back and forth. \"Any tenderness?\" Catcher shook his head. The doctor's bottom lip went out. \"I guess you don't need to wear it then.\" And cast it to the side. Moving on. The doctor reached down. And pulled out a tray. Taking out a stethoscope. \"Would you remove your jacket please?\" Catcher did so. Looking towards Lara again. Agatha on her lap. Looking back at him. Smiling. As he finished stripping the jacket. The doctor came up. And blocked his vision. Reaching down. The doctor unbuttoned two buttons on his shirt. Pushing down the stethoscope. Against his chest. Catcher cringed. And the doctor noticed. Gloved hands went to Catcher's shirt. Unbuttoning the rest. Catcher looked up to Lara. Desperate. Lara stood and came over. Leaning up against the bed. Making Agatha stay in the chair. \"My, my, my...\" the doctor spoke. Pulling back the square of gauze. Finding the bullet wound. Unhealed. Still spitting blood. He flitted away. On heavy feet. \"Haven't seen a real bullet wound like this in years. Most unnatural.\" He went about to his counters. Finding tools. A wad of folded gauze. Orange. A long tube. Dark. And blue. And a syringe. \"If you would lie back please.\" Catcher did so. Swallowing hard. Looking at Lara. She stared back at him. His breath had become fast. Agatha came up. Despite her mother. Reaching out. She took his hand. Comforting him. The doctor chuckled. As he saw them together. And turned to Lara. Who smiled back in kind. But watched her daughter. Intently. Interested. At the trust that was there. The doctor played a song. On his lips. As he walked around. And came back. He set down the things. And turned to Catcher. Plucking the flaps of his shirt away. Tucking them beneath his back. Catcher twisted his eyebrows. Staring at Lara. Her face did the same. Confused. At his fear. \"Here we are then.\" The doctor produced the syringe. Filled it up. Tapped it. Squirted it. Then started down on Catcher's arm. Catcher turned away. Agatha came around. And clamped her hands down. Just when the needle was about to touch his skin. It touched the back of her hand. Instead. \"Agatha. The doctor's trying to-\" but she wasn't listening. \"What is that?\" She asked. The doctor pulled back. Not alarmed. Just reactively. \"It's an anesthesia.\" He smiled widely. \"What's \"anesthesia\"?\" She had trouble pronouncing it. \"It's something that will make him not feel any pain.\" \"Why would he feel pain? I told him I wouldn't let you hurt him.\" \"Ma'am?\" The doctor looked to Lara. Who took her daughter back. \"Agatha, go wait outside.\" \"I want to be in here.\" She said. \"Go.\" Her mother said sternly. Taking her elbow. Forcing the point with a soft squeeze. \"Ow! Fine, I'm going.\" She spoke over her shoulder as she left. \"But if you hurt him, I'm going to hurt you.\" and she meant it. Lara's cheeks reddened. The same way they had. When Catcher had kissed her hand. \"I apologize for my daughter.\" She was so embarrassed. The doctor chuckled still. He seemed to like to do that. A lot. \"It's quite alright. Children these days are very protective of their father's.\" \"He's not -\" but the doctor cut her off. \"Shall we proceed?\" Lara moved up to the head of the table thing. Looking down at Catcher. Sweat had broken out across his brow. And his eyes were wide. Looking at her. Scared. His eyes closed. As the needle went into his arm. As it had initially intended to do. And a whimper escaped him. \"This anesthesia may cause him to be sick a while after I clean this wound. That's how it naturally is.\" He assured. And Lara nodded. The doctor peeled back the dressing. Once more. Poking his finger around the wound. Lara looked down at Catcher. Whose head had fallen to the side. His eyelids fluttering. His lips moving. But saying nothing. Then. Suddenly. He jerked. And faced her. With his eyes still closed. \"Lara? Lara?\" he whispered softly. Making her bend down. \"I'm here...\" she said. \"Watch my heart...watch it for me...\" his whisper faded away. Until he was out. The doctor was busy scratching at the wound. When Lara looked up. Throughout the procedure. Her eyes became fixated on Catcher's toe. Which twitched. When the doctor touched the wound. In a matter of minutes. The doctor set up a sort of rubber ring around the hole. Then took the blue tube. And laid its end in the middle. Then hooked it up to his sink. Nearby. He ran water over the wound. Cleaning up the blood. Before he took to it with stitches. And finally gauzed it back up. \"I couldn't seem to find the bullet,\" the doctor grunted as he pulled off his gloves. \"It must have fallen out. The wound's cleaned now, so there's no chance of infection. But like I told you, that anesthesia's going to make him woozy for a day or so after he wakes up. Just till it gets cleaned out of him.\" \"He can't remember anything...\" she said suddenly. The doctor winked an eyebrow at her. Before going to his head. Touching it gently with his hands. Feeling it like a piece of fruit. \"There seems to be no fracture with which that would account for it. And besides his face, there's nothing wrong. It might just be a temporary case of amnesia.\" He smiled kindly. In the back of her mind. She seriously doubted that. He looked at her. But she was staring. Enveloped. At Catcher's chest. \"Don't worry ma'am. He'll be right as rain in 24 hours.\" \"Thank you.\" She answered automatically. Lara found herself chewing on her thumbnail. As the doctor briefly touched her shoulder. And left the room.[Chapter 11] CHAPTER ELEVEN - THE COUCH Lara looked at Catcher. Nestled in the couch. A blanket over him. Rocking slightly. Mumbling words in a whisper. There was sweat on his brow. \"Mommy?\" Lara looked up from him. \"Hey baby,\" Lara yawned. And rubbed her eyes. As her daughter came forward. Holding her plush cat. Mosey. Stretched and old. \"What are you doing out of bed?\" \"I couldn't sleep.\" Which was an obvious lie. She'd probably been sleeping great. \"Did the doctor hurt him?\" She turned to Catcher. Looking at his clammy face. \"No, he just cleaned up his cut. And gave him some medicine.\" \"Is that what the needle was for?\" Lara nodded. \"I don't like needles. Neither does Catcher.\" \"Did he tell you that?\" \"No, but nobody likes needles. Not even junkies, right? That's why they use those inhalers...\" Lara closed her eyes. \"Where did you learn that?\" Agatha was silent. Even when her mom looked at her again. No doubt. She learned it from John. Speaking of which. \"Do you know where your daddy is?\" Agatha shook her head. \"He's not home.\" She didn't seem mad. Or sad. Or concerned. She just simply shrugged it off. Uncaringly. Lara. Regretfully. Was beginning to feel the same way. John was gone so much now. She too had stopped noticing. If he was ever here. Or not. \"Do you still love him?\" It snapped her out of thought. \"Who? Your daddy?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Of course I do, sweetie...\" \"I don't.\" the comment sent Lara back. \"Agatha. That's a horrible thing to say.\" It came automatically. \"But it's true...\" And Lara knew it was. Even in her own heart. The feeling of love was failing. It had been for six years. \"Go back to bed.\" Somehow. Agatha knew that was going to be her reaction. And she accepted it. \"He's drooling mom.\" Agatha crouched down. Looking at Catcher. \"I know,\" she turned back to him. And dabbed lightly at the spit. \"Go back upstairs and go to sleep, alright?\" \"Goodnight mom.\" \"Goodnight puddin' bear. Kisses.\" A silly name. Agatha looked warily. Then leaned in. And kissed her mom. \"I love you baby.\" Lara gave her daughter a big squeeze. \"I love you too.\" And she went up the stairs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ She heard a groan from the other room. And lifted up her head. Craning her neck. Seeing nothing but paper. Dark. And blue. She'd fallen asleep. Head on the table. And the paper became stuck to her forehead. She pulled it off. Smiling at herself. Before there was another groan. Rising on wobbly legs. She went to the door. To see Agatha standing next to Catcher. Still in her pajamas. Still holding her cat. Watching him. \"Agatha?\" Lara came up. And put her hands on her shoulders. Kneeling down beside her. Agatha barely turned back. \"He's dreaming.\" \"Yes he is.\" Lara kissed the side of her daughter's head. Leaving her lips there. Smelling her soft hair. \"I wonder what he's dreaming about...\" her head tilted away. Interested. \"I don't know, but we better let him get some more sleep.\" She patted her on the bum. Trying to shoo her off. But Agatha only turned. \"Can he stay here mommy?\" Lara reached up. And wiped the sleep from Agatha's eyes. \"He has his own home.\" \"But he's alone there. And he's scared.\" She frowned. \"How do you know that?\" \"He told me.\" \"When?\" \"He's always scared.\" Agatha turned back to Catcher. \"I can tell. He doesn't like being alone. It makes his heart hurt.\" \"Oh honey,\" Lara wrapped her in her arms. Hugging her warmly. \"He's not alone.\" \"If he goes away he'll be alone\" There were tears in Agatha's eyes. Raw emotion. Unobstructed. \"He doesn't have anybody.\" Lara felt the heat in her eyes. But held back the companion tears. \"He's the only one that likes me mom. He's my only friend.\" She said sadly. A tear slipping. \"What about Nikky?\" \"Nikky treats me like a baby.\" Agatha crossed her arms. \"I hate her.\" \"I'm your friend sweetie...\" Lara tried. Agatha shook her head. \"You can't be my friend. You're my mom.\" Catcher groaned. And shifted on the couch. The dream had him. \"Please mommy,\" Agatha wiped at her tear. \"Please let him stay. He's really nice and he won't do anything bad. Please?\" It seemed silly. Treating him as if he were a pet. But her daughter's words. Made sense. \"I have to talk to your dad.\" \"But dad hates him. He'll say no.\" \"Agatha, daddy doesn't hate him.\" \"He does so! Why'd he hurt him then?\" she worriedly turned back to Catcher. And quieted down. So as not to wake him. \"And why does he stay away all the time?\" Lara couldn't answer that. At least not with anything Agatha would believe. \"Mom? Would you let him stay if it was your pick? All by yourself without daddy?\" \"We owe you a trip to the park, don't we?\" Lara avenued. \"Don't change the subject. Would you? Would you let him stay?\" Damn Agatha's beautiful eyes. So real. Her father's weren't real. Not his. At least. Not anymore. Lara pulled her closer. And kissed her forehead. \"Yes Agatha, I'd let him stay.\" Agatha smiled. And watched him. Sleeping fitfully. Blankets clutched about him. Her mother watched him too. \"He makes my heart happy.\" She said quietly. \"I think I love him...\" A silly. Cute. Six year old heart. Kind of love. As if to answer. Catcher sighed contentedly. His arm coming out. From beneath the blanket. His hand touching the floor. \"Do you love him too mommy?\" she asked quietly. Craning her neck. She wasn't asking about the same kind of love. Lara thought about it. But never answered.[Chapter 12] CHAPTER TWELVE - THE PARK Lara dog-eared the page in her book. And looked up. Seeing Catcher on his belly. Facing Agatha. Who was on her belly too. They were staring at a dandelion. Which had died. And was now sitting with a full head of seeds. Like a feathery snowball. On a stalk. \"One...\" Agatha began counting. Catcher licked his lips. \"Two...\" she drew it out. Seeing the impatience in his eyes. \"Remember,\" she tricked with a smile. \"It's on three...\" She waited. He watched. \"Three!\" They each blew their hardest. The little dandelion shuddering. Spilling its seeds. Agatha had to shut her eyes. To keep the hundreds from going into them. \"Okay! Okay!\" she relented. \"You won!\" He stopped blowing. Her laughter subsiding. Then she fingered the stalk. Snapping off the head. Watching the milky stuff come out. \"But you only did though because you have bigger lungs than I do.\" She said. Making sure she still had her dignity. \"You just have a smaller mouth.\" He reasoned. \"No,\" Agatha picked the empty stalk. From the grass. Looked at it. Then cast it to the side. \"Mom says I have a big mouth. 'One too big for my own good'.\" She had to squint one eye. And look up into her head. To remember the words exactly. Catcher leaned forward. And put his thumb and first finger. On the corners of her mouth. Then pulled back. And measured his own. With his other hand. Comparing them. \"Mine's still bigger.\" He said. \"You sure don't talk very much for having a big mouth then.\" She pondered. Reaching out. Touching his mouth. Gauging. Like he did. Spreading his lips. To see teeth. Giggling. She wiped the wetness onto her shirt. \"Should I talk more?\" \"If you want.\" She rolled over onto her back. Looking up at the clouds. \"Mom says I talk a lot. I bet I have to talk a lot to keep my lips from melting together. It's like if you make a silly face, they say it stays that way.\" \"Does it?\" \"Probably,\" she offered. Her voice almost like a librarian. Who knew everything. At the age of six. \"Nikky said she saw a girl pull her lips out from the sides and they stayed that way forever.\" \"How does she know that it's forever?\" Agatha rolled back over. Coming to face him again. Catcher was picking at the grass. He looked up. \"I don't know.\" She looked at him. Even though it wasn't answerable. She liked that question. Her little head cocked. \"Do you like it here?\" She set it down on her crossed arms. \"In the park?\" \"No, with me.\" her shoulders shrugged up a bit. As she too picked at the grass. \"Yes.\" \"Good.\" She smiled. \"I like you here too.\" Rolling fully. She got up. And wiped the grass from her clothes. Catcher did the same. \"Do you know how to play 'Captain Shadow'?\" Looking towards the ground. He shook his head. Looking down. Standing in front of her. \"I can teach you. You wanna play?\" He shrugged. And nodded. At the same time. \"Kay. The game is, you try and step on each other's shadows. And the last person that gets stepped on. Is 'it'.\" \"What's 'it'?\" \"It's the last person that gets their shadow stepped on. Understand?\" Catcher shook his head again. Agatha sighed. \"Come here,\" she took his hand. And pulled him around to her other side. \"See my shadow?\" She pointed down. And he nodded. \"You're standing on it now. So, you're 'it'.\" \"Because I'm standing on your shadow?\" \"Yeah!\" Agatha answered. \"Now, the tree's base.\" \"What's 'base'?\" \"The tree is.\" Agatha would never grow tired of teaching him. Even when he still didn't get it. She explained. \"Base is where you can't step on someone's shadow.\" \"Even if you're 'it'?\" \"Even if you're 'it'.\" She confirmed. \"Alright.\" She stepped back. So he wasn't on her shadow anymore. \"You're 'it'.\" \"Why am I 'it'?\" \"Because I say so.\" \"Why do you get to say so?\" \"You're making this a lot harder than it needs to be.\" She sighed with a smile. \"We definitely need to work on you some more. Here, do you want me to be 'it' first then?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, I'm 'it', you go run.\" Catcher took off. \"But you can't run too fast!\" She called after him. \"Why not?\" He called back. \"Because I can't run as fast as you!\" \"Isn't that the point?\" \"No! That makes it unfair!\" \"Okay.\" Catcher slowed down. Puffing. Already. Agatha came up easily beside him. \"But you have to run so it's hard.\" \"Oh.\" Catcher sped up. His hand on his chest. And Agatha followed suit. They weaved in and out. Sprinting through the grass. Both laughing. Until Catcher went under the tree. \"Base!\" He called. And Agatha stopped at the edge of the shadow. Smiling. \"Yeah, but you can't get out now.\" She smiled cockily. Her arms held wide. Shifting back and forth on her feet. Ready for his any move. \"Yes I can.\" He ran straight for her. Something she didn't expect. And vaulted right over her head. Barely touching her shoulders. He took off running. When he landed. \"Hey!\" Agatha called as he ran off. \"You can't do that!\" \"Why not?\" He called back. Stopping. Huffing. Something hurt. His hand went to his chest again. \"Because you're 'it' now.\" She stuck out her tongue. \"But you didn't step on my shadow...\" \"But you can't touch. And touching's the same as stepping on a shadow. \"I touched you though, you didn't touch me. That doesn't make sense.\" \"It doesn't have to make sense. Touching's touching. And it doesn't matter who did it to who. You touched me - who was 'it' - and now you're 'it' for touching me.\" \"That's not true.\" \"Yes it is!\" She came back. Then turned to her mom. Who was sitting on the bench. Watching them. \"Mom? It doesn't matter who touches who right?!\" She called. \"She's right Catcher, you're 'it'.\" Lara claimed. Turning a page in her book. Smiling. Cocking an eye to him. Not noticing his hand. Massaging his chest. \"See!?\" Agatha stuck her tongue out again. \"Fine.\" Catcher breathed. Smiling devilishly. As he swooped down upon Agatha. Lightning fast. She yelped in surprise. And delight. And ran. She barely escaped him. Her little legs pumping. While his swallowed the ground. Like a giant. She hurried up a rise. Her little heart pumping. As she made it to the top. Triumphant. She turned back. Only to see him stooped over. Clutching at his chest. His knees buckled. And he fell. Wheezing. Clenching at his borrowed shirt. Dark. And blue. Trying to reach his heart. Which was hurting. And fell over onto his side. Breathing hard. \"Catcher! What's wrong?\" Agatha came streaking down the hill. Stumbling once. Before she was over him. Her hands on his arms. He couldn't speak. Only pant. \"Is something hurting you?\" He looked up at her. There was pain in his eyes. And fear. \"MOMMY!\"[Chapter 13] CHAPTER - THE HEART \"Catcher?\" Lara bent down. Next to him. Putting a hand on his shoulder. \"Catcher, what's wrong?\" He couldn't stop wheezing. And he stuck up his hand. Putting it against her collarbone. Trying to push her away. He felt like she was invading him. Invading his air. \"It's alright,\" she spoke softly. Leaning in closer. Despite the hand. \"I'm going to help you.\" As if it were the key. His hand dropped away. \"...ow...\" the only word he could get out. Weak and mewed. He tried to roll over. Onto his face. \"Where does it hurt?\" Her hands went to where his were. Peeling them back. \"Does it hurt here? Your chest?\" He nodded. Eyes clenching shut. As she rolled him. Onto his back. Placing her palm on his chest. Trying to see if it was on the outside. \"Is it your wound Catcher? Is that what's hurting you?\" He shook his head. \"My heart...\" Agatha was crying behind her. Her little hands. Gripping her shirt. At Lara's shoulder. \"Agatha honey, it's alright, he's going to be okay.\" She tried to comfort her daughter. While Catcher clung to her wrists. She turned back. Suddenly. He sprung up. His arms going about her. Hugging her close. His breath was in her ear. Fast and hard. His chest bumping against hers. \"Lara...Lara...\" he was saying. Whimpering words. Between gasps. Like he'd done in the doctor's office. Like a little child. Her arms closed around him. Hesitantly. Feeling odd. \"It's okay,\" so strange. \"I'm here.\" \"...Lara...Lara...\" it was his whispered mantra. \"Catcher, I need you to calm down. Take slow deep breaths, okay? Can you do that?\" He nodded. His chin bumping her shoulder. As he tried. His wheezing got less. And less. Until his eyes closed. And his breathing became slow. Like she'd said. \"That's it.\" She replaced her head. Against him. Turned loose with one arm. And reached back. Pulling her daughter in. She held them both. So close. Feeling them move. Until suddenly. They moved as one. For one brief moment. Their bodies moved as one. \"Keep breathing like that, you're doing good.\" The words came from her mouth. Like liquid. Soft. And warm. And comfortable. She rubbed Agatha's back. Trying to calm her down. And did the same to Catcher. Rocking gently. \"Does it still hurt?\" \"No...it stopped...\" His hold on her. Became tighter. His lips. Brushing her ear. \"Watch my heart.\" He whispered. \"I still want to play...\"[Chapter 14] CHAPTER FOURTEEN - THE WAR After going through this part a couple hundred times. I've realized that it is SO much more fun to read the talking parts out loud. You feel silly, but it makes the chapter much more enjoyable. Cheers! ~ They ambled into the house. Awkward. Hanging off one another. \"Quite a scare at the park today I see.\" Lara came in. Her arms were around Catcher's shoulders. Like the blanket. And Agatha held his hand. On the other side. Squinting through the darkness. She looked for the person. \"Who are you?\" How'd he know they were at the park? \"You don't even know your own husband anymore...\" \"John?\" She squinted hard. Trying to make out his form. It was the first time he'd been back home. The entire week. \"We're lucky he didn't die today.\" \"It was just a little scare, nothing at all...\" She tried to smile. But the darkness took it from her face. The hair on the back of her neck. Stood up on end. There was something wrong. Lara turned loose and leaned down. Talking to Agatha. \"Why don't you take him up to bed. I'll be there in a minute to check on you.\" Agatha looked at the dark room. Feeling her hair rise too. Hesitating. \"Go on sweetie. Daddy and I need to talk.\" She tapped her on the nose. And Agatha nodded. Pulling Catcher up the stairs. She heard the groan of leather. And turned back to the darkness. \"What are you doing?\" Lara asked warily. Coming forward. Her hand going to the light switch. Flipping it on. But no lights came on. \"No. What are you doing?\" \"What did you do to the lights?\" \"I disconnected them.\" He said matter of factly. \"What have you been doing with him?\" \"What are you talking about? John? What's wrong with you?\" \"He's dead Lara. Witwer is dead.\" \"I know that.\" She contested. \"That's not Witwer.\" \"Who is then? A figment of my fucking imagination?\" Anderton seethed. Mockingly amused as he said it. \"His name's Catcher. He's...\" \"What?\" he cut her off. \"You named the fucker?\" He threw something in the dark. And it shattered. Making her jump. \"You know you can't name things. You get attached to shit when you name it. You know that.\" \"Don't swear John, Agatha can hear us.\" \"How would you know that?\" She didn't know where he was now. His voice sounded like it was in a million different places. All at once. \"They can hear through the vents.\" \"The vents huh?\" She heard him move. And jumped in surprise when there was pounding. His fist clanging loudly. Against the vent. \"Can they hear that?! Can you fucking hear that?!!\" He screamed at the top of his lungs \"Stop it John! You're scaring me.\" She commanded. And the clanging stopped. \"I'm scaring you?\" He came close. But she couldn't see him. Only feel his breath on her neck. \"My fucking family's being ripped away from me and you're scared?\" He laughed amusedly. \"You have no idea what scared is.\" \"Nobody's taking your family away from you.\" Her voice hitched in her throat. Her arms clutched about herself. \"You're pushing us away.\" \"Oh yeah Lara?\" he breathed vehemently, \"I'm pushing you away? What about the night he came? You let him sleep in our house. The joy ride to the city? What was that about? The lunch? The park? It seems to me I'm not doing any pushing, you daffy bitch.\" She only knew one time. When John had ever spoken to her like that. \"You've been using again, haven't you?\" She didn't have to see. To know. Her voice shuddered. As she tried to hold her ground. \"This isn't about me. It's about the man who's trying to steal away my family. The dead fucker you're replacing me with.\" \"Replacing you? How can he be replacing you when you're not even there to be replaced?!\" She'd said too much. And clamped her hand over her mouth. \"So that's how it is, huh?\" He moved through the darkness like a snake. \"I'm a bad husband, a bad father. Is that it?\" He was to her left. No. To her right. No. Was he behind her? \"No! You've changed John. Ever since Lamar -\" \"Shut up about Lamar!\" A backhand came from the darkness. And struck her across the face. Nearly knocking her over. Tears welled in her eyes. But she did not step back. \"You ever talk about Lamar again and I'll kill you! Understand?\" Her hand went up to her face. Shaking. As he padded around her. \"He was a great man...\" Anderton breathed. \"He killed two people in cold blood. That makes him a horrible person.\" She found the transparent faults. But stuttered none the less. \"H- h - He screwed with America's sense of security, that's nothing we'll never be able to win back.\" \"Fuck America's security!\" John yelled. \"Most of those people out there don't even deserve to live. They're only ever gonna be half of what Lamar or I am.\" \"Catcher's twice of what you'll ever be!\" Again. Too much. Words in haste. With horrible consequences. \"What?\" Oh shit. She tried to crowbar her foot. Back out of her mouth. \"He makes Agatha smile John. For the first time since she was a baby, she smiles.\" Lara broke down. Trying to explain. Sympathetically. \"He makes her...\" He could feel him circling her. But always stayed far enough away. So that she couldn't see him. She didn't want to say the word. \"Happy?\" he asked. And sadly. She nodded. \"So that's it...\" his voice had faded. Now instead of anger. There was clearness. Understanding. Hatefully so. \"I don't make her happy...\" \"No John,\" she tried to counter. Putting out her hands. Trying to feel for him. \"That's not what I said....\" \"You don't have to say it Lara,\" he was angry again. \"It's clear enough now. I don't make you happy...\" \"John...\" she tried to reason. \"No.\" He cut off. \"That's it. This is the end.\" \"What 'end' John? You're confused, let's sleep on it...we can talk about it in the morning.\" \"No, there's not going to be a morning.\" He fated. \"You have to make a decision Lara. Right now.\" \"A decision?...\" \"It's him or me! Who's it going to be?!\" He talked like a game show host. One that was going to kill the contestant. \"The stakes are in! All bets are off! Take a stand sweetheart!\" His voice was like venom. Acid in his throat. As he spat it in her ear. She stood with her mouth open. \"Your husband, whom you're legally contracted to, till you die, or some fucking corpse who's come back from his own death?!\" \"You can't -\" She thrust her finger out. And he grabbed it. Twisting her wrist around. Breaking it. Hearing the bone snap. She cried out. As he thrust his face at hers. Coming into the light. There were deep bags under his eyes. Dark. And blue. \"John...\" she whispered hoarsely. \"You're hurting me...please stop...\" tears were finally in her eyes. \"...John...stop....\" As she looked into her husband's. No. Not his eyes. Someone else's. \"HIM OR ME!??!\"[Chapter 15] CHAPTER FIFTEEN - THE SEX There was a knock at the door. \"Lara?\" A voice came through the wood. Soft. And caring. \"Leave me alone Catcher.\" She sobbed. \"I could hear you crying.\" He spoke through the door. \"Are you alright?\" \"I'm fine Catcher,\" she put her face into her hands. \"Just go back to sleep...you shouldn't be up...\" she sniffed. \"And you shouldn't cry alone, no one will be there to catch your tears...\" Laura turned. And looked at the door. Before coming forward. And opening it \"Agatha played it for me.\" He breathed. When he saw her face. \"She said it was your favorite song.\" \"It is.\" she smiled through the tears. \"Can I come in?\" He asked. And she took a shaky breath. Before nodding her head. Wiping at her tears. With her thumb. He noticed her finger. Swollen. Dark. And blue. Made a move towards it. But she pulled away. \"It's nothing. Where is she?\" \"She's asleep. In my room.\" Catcher closed the door behind him. Keeping it quiet. \"I have a headache. Will you get me a bottle of whiskey please?\" She cried into her hands. Couldn't hold it back. Tried to stop it. But cried some more. \"Where is one?\" \"In that table beside you.\" She said through heavy breaths. Pulling out the drawer. He rummaged about. And found it. Giving it to her. With shaking hands. She unscrewed the cap. And took a long. Hard gulp. Clenching her face as it went down. The liquid dried her tears. \"John left me...\" she finally said. Sniffing. \"Will he be back?\" \"I don't know.\" Her voice stretched thin. As she took another drink. Her mouth curling. As tears came forward again. He put his hands on her shoulders. But she ducked away from them. Going towards the window. \"It's my fault...\" she breathed. \"It's all my fault...\" Catcher watched her back. Hearing her harshly berate herself. Without stopping her. Watching her drink herself silly. Without stopping her. \"I don't know what to do...\" she blubbered. \"The situation...I don't know what to do.\" She was crying again. Her words coming out with her tears. Listless. And breathy. By the end of the bottle. Her forehead was against the glass. Her nose smushed. The rain outside reflecting her tears. Which had all. But dissipated. It always seemed to rain here. Especially on the sad days. \"Catcher?\" She stood back from the window. Her voice was now solid. Watching the empty spot in the driveway. Where John's car use to sit. And probably would never sit again. \"Yes Lara?\" He asked. Now sitting on the bed. Looking at her back. The way the soft light. Rolled over her shoulders. Making them glow. She turned. Staring at him. Watching the way the soft light. Rolled over his shoulders. Making them glow. \"Do you think I'm pretty?\" Her self worth had gone down. Thanks to the second abandoning. Thanks to John's words. Thanks to the alcohol. The wide collar of her nightshirt hung from her shoulder. Her long sleeves ruffled at the bottom. From where she'd wiped her nose. He looked at her. \"I think you're beautiful.\" \"Would you have sex with me?\" The tears said it. The liquor said it. The situation said it. She said it. \"What's 'sex'?\" He asked. \"It's when a man and a woman love each other.\" She felt nothing. Explaining it to him. She thought she should feel something. But she didn't. \"Do we love each other?\" He asked. As she approached the bed. Tears welling in her eyes. She took anther drink. The last in the bottle. She shook her head. Then second-guessed. \"We could.\" Her voice was a whisper now. And he could smell the alcohol. Even from across the room. Reaching up. She began to pull at her clothes. Taking them off. His face did not move as he watched. She stripped from her nightshirt. And pushed her nightpants down her legs. Standing there now in her panties. No bra. And still his face did not move. From her face. \"Do you love me Catcher?\" She climbed up onto the bed. Kneeling over his outstretched legs. Straddling them. She reached out. And pulled at his tee shirt. He raised his arms. And let it slide off. With ease. Revealing his chest. Pretty. But bruised. \"I could.\" He breathed as her hands went to his pants. Touching his zipper. Her lips were at his chest. Her teeth biting his skin. The ghost of alcohol. Warming her breaths. \"I feel funny.\" He said. His eyes closing. \"Is that love?\" With a mouthful of him. She began to cry. Anew. At his innocence. He looked down. And put his arms around her. The crown of her head. Pressing in his breastbone. \"It could be...\" she murmured wetly. Her lips touching his skin. Smooth. Warm. And dry. \"Do you feel the same way?\" he asked quietly. \"About me?\" \"You mean, do I love you?\" she whispered. He nodded. Her tears tapped his chest. And ran down to his belly. She looked at him. Hard. \"You have two different colored eyes.\" She whispered. \"Agatha says it's from inbreeding.\" This broke a smile onto Lara's face. Catcher smiled in return. \"I don't think inbreeding, could ever make anything as beautiful as you...\" she cried warm tears. The dripped down her cheeks. Until she collapsed fully against him. Letting him cradle her. As she folded into his lap. His arms coming around her. Holding her close. \"Is sex what you still want?\" He asked. Breathing into her hair. Kissing the top of her head. \"I don't know.\" She closed her eyes. \"I think so.\"[Chapter 16] all i have are apologies and barely enough gumption to say \"i'm an ass.\" cause i was never worthy of such fabulous folk as yourselves... CHAPTER SIXTEEN - THE NIGHT He woke up naked. His arms around her waist naked. Cradled in her lap naked. Face nested in her hair. Tickling his nose. He had to sneeze. What an odd sensation. For a man that's never sneezed. It's like a blind man. Seeing the color blue. For the first time. Dark. And blue. He sneezed. Hard. One that tore his ribcage in half. And sent his heart flying against his chest. Crashing. Bleeding. Falling with a thump. Against his big intestine. Bounce. Small intestine. Bounce. Liver. Bounce. Kidney. Bounce. Belly. Stopping. Something was wrong. \"Catcher?\" The sneeze awoke the sleeper. Not the kiss. His hands went to his fallen heart. Clutching at his empty chest. \"My heart,\" he said. Through wide. Scared. Eyes. Eyes that bled tears. And wrought pain. \"My heart's gone.\" Lara didn't understand. \"What are you talking about?\" She reached up. To touch his hand. His heart. To show him that it was still there. But he pulled away. Doubling over. Sucking in. Feeding fire. He collapsed sideways. Smashing his face. In the soft. Cool. Blankets. \"What's wrong?\" She tried to lift him up. But his body had become heavy. His bare skin cold. His muscles lead. His veins refrigerator coils. \"My heart's gone,\" he repeated. \"It fell. It hurts Lara. It hurts so much.\" He was scared. And hurting. She was confused. And helpless. \"What do you want me to do?\" He sat up. Fast. So fast. He knocked her across the side of the head. Her hair splashing. Blood splattering. As she tumbled. Crash. Shlunk. Poohm. She was dead. Naked on the floor. \"I told you to watch my heart.\" He cried. \"I told you...\" They were naked.[Chapter 17] CHAPTER SEVENTEEN - THE MOSEY It was still raining outside. Harder now. She sat up. From the floor. One arm on the side of the bed. The other holding the side of her jaw. Where he'd hit her. There was no blood. Just a red spot. That would most likely become a bruise. He was breathing hard. Surprise in his eyes. Pain in his forehead. From where he'd hit her. Not in his chest. Like he'd dreamt. \"Are you okay?\" She slowly stood up. Using the bed for balance. Still top naked. Looking down. She wrapped her arm around herself. Suddenly embarrassed. The alcohol costume had worn off. She rummaged to find her top. And put it back on. Followed by her sleep pants. Before coming back over to him. Catcher still upright on the bed. Shirtless. Still surprised. Working things out in his head. He'd never had a violent dream before. Like that. Not the he remembered. \"What happened?\" He was looking at her now. Worry in his eyes. That he'd hurt her. \"I don't understand...\" \"You're alright.\" She was comforting. Despite the pain in her jaw. Climbing back up onto the bed. But not close to him. \"You had a dream.\" Her head was really woozy. He'd struck her hard. He whimpered. Covering his head with his arms. His eyes cinching. \"I'm sorry. I don't like dreams...\" He hunkered down. Ashamed at hurting her. \"Do you remember what the dream was about?\" She was worried. More about him. And his reaction. Than her silly. Aching. Jaw. \"My heart fell out...\" His hand went to his heart. While the other stayed across the top of his head. He finally looked up at her. \"I'm sorry.\" He said again looking at the welt. Covered by her hand. \"It's oka....ah...\" Something panged her. Most likely her tongue. Where she'd bit it. When he'd hit her. Accidentally. He was ashamed. And he got off the bed. Hurriedly. Going to the door. \"I'm sorry Lara, I'm sorry I hit you...\" \"Catcher? Where are you going? Come back you didn't mean to!\" But he was out the door. Running down the hall. She tried to get up. To follow. But a rush of blood spattered across her eyes. Dimming the dim lights. Making her head heavy. She stumbled. Before she fell. Blacking out. On the floor. Dark. And blue. \"Mommy?\" Agatha came to the door. Holding Mosey. Her plush cat. Stretched. And old. She'd heard the thumps. And commotion. Now she found her mom on the floor. Breathing lightly. \"Mommy!\" She ran towards her. Kneeling down. Tapping her shoulder. \"Mommy wake up...\" Lara jerked. But didn't open her eyes. \"Mommy? Where's Catcher?\" She shook Lara. But Lara just slept. Below. She heard the door slam. She ran to the window. Mosey still clutched tight. She watched a figure in the slashing gray rain. Running madly. Stumbling. Falling. Picking itself up again and running again. \"Catcher!\" She called through the window. But he didn't turn around. Didn't stop. Just kept running. He couldn't have heard her anyway. She bolted. Back towards the door. Down the hall. Down the stairs. Through the entryway. Past the pictures. Opening the door. Through the porch. And out into the pouring rain. With nothing but Mosey. In nothing but her jammies. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ She found him sitting at the edge of the lake. On Agatha's old swing set. Swinging lightly. As she came closer. She saw his shoulders jumping. His head in his hands. His coat around him. He'd grabbed it when he ran out. She came up. Silently. And got up on the swing next to him. Watching him cry. She hugged Mosey tight with one arm. Fending off the cold rain. \"Catcher?\" She whispered. Leaning over towards him. The swing chains groaning crooked. \"Leave me alone.\" He turned away. His face still covered. His shoulders still bouncing. He was covered in mud. From when he'd fallen. She could see it from where the coat didn't cover. Where his hands didn't cover. \"What happened?\" She asked. Ignoring his curtness. \"I hit her...\" He cowered. The lake beyond was grumbling with raindrops. Screaming because they were stabbing its skin. \"Why?\" She asked. \"I was dreaming...\" \"What were you dreaming?\" \"That my heart fell out of its place.\" She got down off the swing. And came towards him. He saw her coming and cringed away. She pulled back. Confused. \"I don't want to hit you too.\" He said. She twisted her eyebrows. \"Would you hit me? On purpose?\" \"No.\" \"Did you hit mommy on purpose?\" \"No.\" She came closer. Despite his silent protest. And came up between his knees. Leaning the side of her head against his chest. Listening. He shuddered with his breath. She looked down. At Mosey. Then took his hand. And made him hold him. As she leaned in close again. Listening again. She cupped her free hand against her other ear. Blocking out the rain. Closing her eyes. \"Your heart's where it's suppose to be...\" He could feel her shiver. The way she'd done. When they'd walked to her house. In the rain. She leaned back. Smiling. With chattering teeth. Pulling her arms around her. Her jammies soaked through. \"It was just a dream.\" \"I don't like dreams.\" He said. As she began to climb. Climbing his knees like a rock wall. Up into his lap like the final plateau. Still shaking. \"Not all dreams are bad.\" She commented. Leaning in close. Feeding off his warmth. The back of her head at his bare belly. Her hair tickling his skin. \"You just had a bad one is all...\" He shrugged off his coat. And pulled it around on top of her. Curled on his lap. The rain now piercing his back. Stinging his shoulders. Stabbing his flanks. \"I forgive you.\" She whispered. \"You didn't mean to.\" Huddling. Still shivering. \"You should go inside.\" She looked up. Noticing he was top naked. \"What about you? You'll freeze out here.\" \"I'm fine.\" He lied. Already cold. \"Go inside.\" She went to protest. But he cut her off. Turning stern. \"Go inside Agatha. Go check on your mom. She needs you.\" \"Catcher...\" He straightned his legs. Making her slide off. Forcing her onto the ground. Still holding the coat about her. Loosely. The bottom drug in the mud. \"I need to be alone.\" She began to unshoulder the coat. \"No,\" he held out a hand. Keeping it on her. \"You keep it.\" She bit her bottom lip. Scowling worriedly. He looked down. Tears still in his eyes. Noticing Mosey. He stretched out his arm. Offering her the cat. \"No,\" she shook her head. Keeping it with him. \"You keep it.\" And she turned. With a lingering sigh. Then she left. Letting him think. With Mosey.[Chapter 18] CHAPTER EIGHTEEN - THE MILKSHAKE He woke up sideways. Bone dry. Swathed in blankets. Back on the couch. Inside. Clutching Mosey close to his chest. Despite the blankets. And his dryness. He was still cold. He dropped little Mosey. With a *pflumpf* to the floor. The cat sat upright for a moment. Before crashing over onto its side. As Catcher bundled the blankets tighter around him. He heard a noise in the kitchen. That broke him out of his dazing. He coughed. Twice. And sniffed. Only to not be able to. He sat up. Rubbing at his nose. A headache showed itself. One that wrapped around the front of his head. And hung there like a giant band-aid. On the inside of his skull. He stood on shaky legs. Testy. Before he stumbled off toward the other room. \"Hi sleepyhead.\" Agatha said. As he shuffled into the kitchen. Blanket clutched about him. His head dizzy. Throwing the room about. His feet slid sideways. And he stumbled. Lara came out from behind the fridge. Catching him. Interesting. Catching a catcher... \"Whoa, you okay?\" she asked. Helping him to the counter. She was in her sleep pants. Dark. And blue. With bunnies on them. A black camisole. Different clothes than last time. Agatha wore an outfit. To match her mom's pants. Lara had hair pulled back now. Revealing the bruise. That ran the length of her jaw. Catcher reached up. And palmed the side of his head. The room still spinning. As he tried to steady it. \"Here,\" Lara set down a glass of water. In front of him. \"Drink a little bit of this.\" He picked it up. And sipped lightly. Before setting it back down. \"You slept forever!\" Agatha had crawled up onto the counter. Her bottom on the top. Her feet dangling off. Her toes warm in fuzzy bunny slippers. \"I did?\" His throat was cottony. His lungs stuffed with cobwebs. \"You slept the whole day and night and half the day again!\" She exclaimed. \"I thought you were dead.\" \"You did sleep a long time, do you feel alright?\" Lara asked. Noticing the way his skin looked. Pale. And yellowish. Almost like old cheese. He cowered away from her eyes. Upon sight of the bruise again. Remembering what he'd done. \"You sleep like a rock.\" Agatha curled into his vision. Leaning crooked. To make sure she had his attention. \"I had the music turned all the way up.\" \"Much to my disapproval, I might add.\" Lara went back to the fridge. Licking at something on her finger. The one not splinted. Agatha smiled widely. He licked his teeth. Trying to get rid of the cottony feel. \"You probably have horrible breath,\" Agatha explained. \"You slept all day and night and day with your mouth open. I once saw a fly go in there.\" \"No fly went into his mouth...\" \"Did too! I saw it!\" She claimed. \"It probably was crawling around and laid eggs and now he's going to spit out babies one day soon!\" she was enthralled. \"Agatha, that's disgusting...\" her mom came back out of the fridge. Holding a carton of milk. It kept mooing. Till she shook it. \"They're going to come out like little white worms and they're gonna crawl around in your teeth and when you floss you'll scratch their little eyeballs...\" \"Agatha stop it, you're making him sick. You're making me sick. Where do you get stories like this?\" \"Around.\" Agatha said coyly. As Lara lowered an eyebrow to her. Smiling. And shaking her head. \"Are you feeling okay?\" Lara came to the counter. Asking again. And set the milk down. Reaching out. To touch Catcher's forehead. He ducked away. And she pulled back. Looking at him. He looked at the counter. Running his fingers through the cracks in the tile. Feeling the grout. Clearing her throat. Lara came over and kissed the top of Agatha's head. Whispering to her. \"Test his forehead for me, sweetie.\" Agatha reached out. Her tongue coming out to help her reach. And took his forehead in her palm. Part of her little belly showing. Catcher looked up at her. But not at Lara. \"He's warm.\" Agatha diagnosed. \"He's probably sick.\" \"That rain probably didn't do him any good.\" Lara commented. Going to the cupboards. \"Can we watch cartoons?\" Agatha asked. Peeking out. Lara scrunched her face. Thinking. Not very hard. \"Pleeeeeaaaazzzzzz? I really like cartoons! They'll make Catcher feel better!\" She begged. Her stretched face made Lara smile. \"Is that so huh?\" \"Yes, it's true.\" She said. Almost stoically. \"Well then, I suppose yes.\" \"Yay!\" Agatha jumped down. Ran around. Climbed up onto the counter once more. Pressed a button. And a hologram platform slid out from the wall. Pressing another few buttons. A picture came up. Of a cartoon. Wile E. Coyote. Chasing the Roadrunner. A new version. One where he actually catches. The damn bird. Agatha went back to her spot. Sitting next to Catcher. She poked him. \"Guess what?\" He didn't look up. Only tilted his head towards her. Slightly. \"What?\" His voice was low. And sullen. \"Mom's making MILKSHAKES!\" She screamed it. Making Lara jump as she poured a packet of something into a mug. Making Catcher cringe. And reach up to take hold of his aching head. \"Agatha, honey, don't scream.\" Lara put the mug in the microwave. And turned it on. It tested the beverage. And set the exact time. Agatha cringed. Before smiling widely. A hand going over her mouth. And she whispered. \"Do you want a milkshake?\" \"No.\" His throat raw. Causing him pain. His twisting face. Made Lara's face twist. But he didn't look at her. He folded his arms up onto the table. Setting his head down on top of it. Closing his eyes. Agatha turned away from her cartoons. Where she'd escaped to. And frowned at his ho hum demeanor. \"Catcher?\" His eyes tightened. As if it hurt to hear her. \"Are you okay?\" Three times he'd been asked that. The answer was always the same. He'd just never said it. Silly women. \"I feel sick.\" Lara went to the sink. Motion detected. Wet a rag. And came back. Putting it against his head. His eyes had been closed. So he hadn't seen her coming. \"We thought a milkshake would make you feel better.\" Agatha smiled at him. But he didn't smile back. \"I don't like this feeling.\" He mumbled. Feeling the droplets of cold water. Press against the side of his head. Puddling there. His hand went down to his belly. Feeling it grumble. And kick his appendix. Hard. The microwave played a song. A snippet of Bach. Preprogrammed. Signaling it was done. Lara went there. Popped it open. And took out a mug. Steaming. \"Here Catcher, drink this.\" she pushed him up. The rag sliding off with a wet plop. His eyelids heavy. \"You'll feel better.\" His lips were pale. Almost blue. While his skin took on a gray color. Under the lights. A chill coursed over him. Lara was worried. \"Agatha, can you make your own milkshake?\" Agatha didn't turn away from the holovision. \"Yeah.\" Her head was cocked to the side. Watching the 24-hour cartoon channel. Uninterrupted. \"I'm going to take Catcher upstairs.\" Now she turned around. \"Why?\" \"I'm going to take him up to his room. He doesn't feel good.\" Lara said. Smiling comfortingly. \"I'll be back down in a little bit.\" She looked at Catcher. Pale. And sickly. Before nodding to her mom. \"Okay.\" And turning back to the cartoon. \"C'mon,\" Lara coaxed him up. He was too weak to pull away. And if he could have. He would have fallen. He'd become so feeble. In all of three minutes. She threw his arm up around her neck. To help them both. The blanket falling away. As she took his side. Her hands wrapped around his waist. Holding him up. He had no willpower of his own. His head bobbed back and forth on his neck. As they went up the stairs. The stairs were hard. But finally. They reached the top. And made their way down the hall. \"uhnoh...\" \"What?\" Lara tried to understand. \"No...\" Catcher twisted away from her. Falling to his knees. Bracing himself with his hands. She stood there. Looking at him. Keeled over in the middle of the hallway. He was panting. Shaking. Slick with a cold sweat. He shone under the lights. Licking her lips. She kneeled down in front of him. Tipping her head. So that she could see his face. Pushing a piece of loose hair behind her ear. \"Catcher?\" His eyes were closed. His mouth open. Panting breaths. She watched a tear squeeze out from his closed eyes. Roll down his nose. And fall with a plop to the floor. \"Why are you crying?\" He shook his head. Sucking in his breath. He reached up. And shoved away the tears. Before leaning back up. And fighting to stand. She watched him from where she kneeled. As he crawled to the wall. As he climbed to his feet. As he found a footing somewhat. Walked a couple steps. Then fell against the wall. She rose. Slowly. Licking her lips again. Her arms crossed. Following him. He tried to push himself off. To cross the hall. And nearly fell. Until she caught him. He tried to fight away from her. Again. \"Catcher stop.\" She turned. Holding him up. With difficulty. All his weight. Dead in her arms. She stared at him. He looked away. But she demanded his eyes. \"Look at me.\" She said it sternly. But sincere. He looked at her. Reluctantly. His eyes traced the bruise. Glossy. And discolored. \"You didn't mean to. It's not your fault.\" She said it slowly. Sounding out each word. Emphasizing every syllable. \"Alright?\" There were still tears in his eyes. She pushed his arms up. Over her shoulders. And hugged him. Tight. As he fell against her. \"I forgive you.\" His face hit her shoulder. Her face in his hair. She breathed him in. He cried. Silently. \"I forgive you.\" Catcher stifled his breath. Before the onslaught came. Lara let him cry. Agatha smiled. And crept back down the stairs. Sucking on her milkshake.[Chapter 19] CHAPTER NINETEEN - THE SLEEP PAMPERAGE! I thought Catcher could use some lovin' cause he obviously isn't getting enough.... _ silly Catcher... ~ There was a quiet knock at the door. The rain had stopped. Lara opened her eyes. Just resting. Looked down at Catcher. Sleeping on her chest. And smiled lightly. Before turning. \"Yeah?\" \"Can I come in mommy?\" \"Sure baby...\" Agatha walked in. Holding two cups. Both filled with milkshake. Lara's first. Agatha's second. Catcher sniffed. And twitched. As Agatha climbed up onto the bed. Carefully. Lara took her hand off his back. Warm. Getting hold of one of Agatha's cups. Cold. Before she almost tipped it over. And set it on the bedside table. \"I brought you your milkshake.\" Agatha said. Getting situated. Lara put her finger up to her mouth. Hushing her. And Agatha looked down at Catcher. Lara was lying bowed. With her head and shoulders supported upright by pillows. Catcher's head was on her chest. Breathing lightly. Her hand on the side of his head. Rubbing his hair. Her thumb moving in little circles. His arms were akimbo around her. She was laid out straight. While Catcher was mostly jackknifed off to her side. His bare torso laid on her. With his legs bent away. His weight pressed her into the mattress. Hot. And soft. \"Is he still sick?\" It'd been about an hour. Since the hallway. Enough to get Catcher asleep. \"Yes, he is. But he's getting better.\" She felt his forehead. \"He's gotten cooler. And his color's coming back.\" \"I think he just needed love.\" \"Maybe you're right.\" Lara smiled down at him. Reaching over. To take a drink from her milkshake. Kissing Agatha's head. In mid-reach. Liking the comment. \"This is good.\" She smiled. Purposely tipping her glass almost too far. Making a crest on her upper lip. Established with her legs crossed. The milkshake between her thighs. Agatha laughed. \"You have a mustache.\" She was quiet about it. Lara smiled. And wiggled her nose like a rabbit. \"You make tasty milkshakes.\" \"Milkshake kisses!\" Agatha tipped up her glass. And made her own mustache. Leaning over. To kiss her mom on the lips. Meshing milkshake. As they both laughed quietly. \"Mmm,\" Lara licked the mesh off. \"What's yours?\" \"It's Oreo banana.\" Agatha was proud. Looking down into her glass. Splotched with black flecks and yellow chunks. \"I couldn't decide on which one to get.\" \"It's yummy.\" Lara took another sip of her own. - Strawberry - Before setting it back down. Catcher sighed. And snuggled. Both girls looked at him. \"He looks happy.\" Agatha commented. Leaning over to brush at his hair. Just to touch him. \"He does.\" Lara rubbed his hair too. Soft. Agatha put her milkshake next to her mom's. Before leaning in. Snaking her arm beneath Lara's. Linking them. As she leaned her head against her shoulder. Sighing. Agatha stared at Catcher's contented face. \"I think he loves you.\" \"Why do you think that?\" \"I dunno. I can just tell.\" She cocked her head. As if the answer would come. \"Do you love him mom?\" \"I don't know...\" Lara's sentence died away. Not sure what to say. \"Are you going to marry him?\" Lara lifter her arm. And wrapped it around her shoulder. \"Puddin' bear, grown up love doesn't work like that.\" \"Why not?\" Agatha looked up. Her big eyes sincere. \"It just doesn't. You've got to have time, for love to grow.\" \"Like a puppy?\" Excitement was in her voice. Slightly. Coyly. Lara was thrown a bit off guard. \"Yeah, I guess like a puppy.\" \"Can we get a puppy?\" Agatha turned to her mom. Sneaking it in. Lara's mouth came open. \"How sly we are.\" She tightened her arm around her daughter. Smiling at her stealth. Agatha grinned. But didn't press the matter. Looking towards Catcher. Who still slept soundly. Snuggling again. As if Lara's bosom was a pillow. She flinched. When he tried to dig into her breastbone. And smiled. \"How much time does it take to fall in love?\" Agatha asked. \"Depends...\" \"On what?\" \"On stuff...\" She was purposely leaving the answers open. \"What kind of stuff?\" \"Stuff...\" \"Mom!\" She'd had enough. Catcher's eyes came open. Agatha's hands slapping across her mouth. Her eyes wide. Catcher lifted his head. Eyes half closed. As he turned his head to the other side. And set it back down. Sighing deeply. Wrapping his arms tighter. His left fist touched Agatha's foot. And she reached down. And took it in her tiny fingers. Holding it. A smile came across his pale face. Slight. And sleepy. \"What are we gonna do after he wakes up?\" Lara opened her sleeping eyes again. Brought out of her light napping. \"Hmm - what do you want to do?\" She closed her eyes again. Unable to keep them open. Agatha's face twisted as she thought. Before shrugging. And snuggling her head into Lara's shoulder. Closing her eyes too. Feeling the pressure of sleep. \"Let's sleep on it...\" \"Mkay...\" Lara was already halfway in dreamland. There was only soft breathing for the moment. Before it was broken by a whisper. \"Mommy?\" \"Yeah?\" she was losing herself. Fast. \"Can we go get a puppy?\"[Chapter 20] CHAPTER TWENTY - THE STITCHES \"No.\" \"Please mommy? Pleeeeeaaazzz?!\" She was following her around. \"No. We don't need a puppy. You make a mess enough as it is.\" Agatha stopped. Her fists going to her side. A bitterness crossing her little face. She'd woken up grumpy. Lara stopped. Spun around. And mirrored it with a stuck out bottom lip. Showing her defiance. \"I'll cry.\" She threatened. Lara waved the rag she was cleaning with. Before spinning back around. \"Cry away.\" Unsatisfied. \"I'll scratch you.\" She bared her fingernails. Imagining them as sharp as those extinct tiger's she'd seen in books. From school. \"You scratch me and you don't come out of your room for the rest of the day.\" Lara countered. Agatha flopped back on the couch. Defeated. \"But mooooooom!\" She whined. But Lara didn't stop to bother. Just kept cleaning. Agatha crossed her arms over her chest. \"I'll run away.\" \"You have nowhere to go.\" Not missing a beat. Agatha was desperate now. \"This is why daddy left you!\" This stopped Lara. And made her turn. Pain in her eyes. Stiffness in her back. Anger in her heart. She'd tried to forget. Too soon. \"What did you just say?\" \"Daddy left because of you! It's YOUR FAULT I'm a bastard child!\" The onslaught of tears had begun. The dam lifted. With one little thread. At Agatha's disposal. Lara's jaw dropped. \"Where did you learn that word?!\" She came towards her. And Agatha backed up the bottom of the stairs. \"Nikky...\" The moth had come too close to the flame. Some dust had fallen from her wings. Lara's hand went out like an old-time traffic block. Her finger stiff to the top of the stairs. \"Go to your room, right now! And think about what you just said!\" Agatha's face fell. Broken. As she began to cry. Harder. \"Mommy, I'm sorry!\" Her old routine. Tears streaming. As she stretched out her arms. Ready to embrace her mom. Bawling. Wailing. Crying up a storm. \"No. Agatha. Get your butt up to your room before I spank it!\" That sent Agatha staggering away. Screaming and crying hysterically. She broke into a run. Sucking air. Treading tears. And she stomped hard up each step. Pounding down the hall. \"You're in there until I say so!\" Lara yelled. Calming her emotions down. Instantly. She'd learned to do that over the years. Easily. She heard the door slam. Hard. And she flopped down into the couch. Throwing the rag down. \"Fuck...\" she whispered beneath her breath. Tears rushing forward. Her emotions not as in check. As she would have liked. Before she straightened herself up. She heard a sniff from above her. And wiping away the tears. Turned. Seeing Agatha's head peeking out. Her cheeks glossy. And red. \"Your ROOM Agatha!\" Lara yelled. So loud she almost scared herself. \"I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT CATCHER'S AWAKE!\" She screamed back. In a fit of hysterics. Before she bolted away. Disappearing with another slam of her door. Following her heavy feet. Lara rubbed the side of her head. Pausing for a moment. Before she let her emotions out with a heavy sigh. And turned to go up the stairs. She found Catcher on the side of the bed. Head down. Face in hands. Still shirtless. The sheets thrown askew. She sniffed back what was in her head. And came towards him. \"Catcher?\" He looked up. Awake. And better than before. But still slightly pale. Looking skinny. His breath labored. Somewhat. \"Why were you yelling?\" He asked. Slowly. Almost a whisper. Lara shook her head. Shrugging. \"It happens sometime. We usually have a clash of opinions.\" She looked at him. Sitting there. With his head back in his hands. \"We should get you something to wear. And eat. Aren't you hungry?\" \"Not really.\" \"You haven't eaten in a long time, Catcher. You've got to eat something. And it's probably not helping with you being sick.\" She went to the closet. Her presence turning on the automatic light. It chirped. As she pulled out the shirt cupboard. She picked up one of John's shirts. Dark. And blue. With a big white star on the front. Old-school. One he hadn't worn for a long time. So his smell wouldn't be on it. Too much. She smelled it anyway. Burying her nose in it. Smelling him. Or imagining so. Pretending to smell him. Still nestled in the clothes. She came back out. Collected. Only to see Catcher collapsed back across the bed. Arms above his head. Legs loose. Eyes closed. She noticed the gauze. Still taped across his chest. The bruising was probably gone now. She noticed the way his chest moved. As he breathed in slowly. And exhaled even slower. Holding onto each breath. For just the right amount of time. Relaxed. Completely. She noticed the dark hair running down from his bellybutton. Disappearing down into his pants. Glistening in the sun. She cleared her throat. To clear the thoughts away. And came forward. \"Here.\" She offered. Throwing it on his chest. \"You can wear this.\" He lifted his head. Getting those little wrinkles in the side of his neck. And chin. The ones that made Lara's heart speed up. She had a thing for those little wrinkles. She coughed into the back of her hand. Slowing her heart back down. Coming forward again. Reaching out her hand. \"Here,\" again. He looked at her. Grabbed for the shirt. Then her hand. Letting her help him up. \"Scoot.\" She pulled him forward. So that his legs were off the corner of the bed. Feet touching the floor. And she knelt down. His smell swept over her. Nearly knocking her over. That musky. Slightly unwashed smell. \"We can probably take that off.\" Jeez? Was it hot in here? She reached up towards the bandaging. And he looked down at it. Licking his lips. She liked his tongue. How pink it was...how thick it was...how... She cleared her throat again. Righting herself by shifting herself up. Balanced on her haunches. \"Are you alright?\" He had the blue tee shirt crumpled in his one hand. His voice was deep and quiet. Weakened by the sickness. And the lack of food. \"Yeah...\" she fended. Peeling back the dressing. To reveal the stitches. Holding together connected skin. Healed. So far as she could tell. With her expert opinion. Anyway. \"We should cut those,\" she stood up fast. Swallowing hard as she turned. \"I'll get some scissors.\" She went into the master bathroom. The lights coming on. As she went to the mirror. And looked at herself in it. Not believing the feelings running through her. She bent down. The water came on. And she splashed it cold on her face. Trying to wake herself up. Well. It kind of worked. Drying her face off quickly. She rummaged for her small scissors. And came back out of the bathroom. Holding the scissors. As if she was going to sell them. Catcher was where he had been. Now with his eyes partially closed. A slight cringe on his face. She came to him. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yes.\" He came up. Eyes popping open. Extinguishing the cringe. And sitting straight up. Lara kneeled down in front of him. Reaching out carefully to slide the scissors beneath the stitches edge. And clipped. The stitching had broken down. Till it was about half the width of dental floss. Now it only needed to be pulled out. She set down the scissors. And felt something tickle her forehead. But both her hands were busy. One pressing against the stitching. Making sure it didn't tear anything. While the other pulled at it. Lightly. She tried to wink the tickle away. But that only made it tickle more. Suddenly. A shadow came up over her face. And her eyes rolled. To find Catcher's finger at her forehead. Just above her brow. Scooping up the water drop. That the towel had missed. He wiped it dry with his thumb. Before pulling his arm back in. She looked into his eyes. Smiling slightly. \"Thank you.\" He nodded and smiled in return. As she turned back to her work. She pulled slowly. Her eyes flicking up. On occasion. To watch his lip in his teeth. \"Am I hurting you?\" She asked. \"No.\" He straightened. Remaining strong. She pulled. Until finally his hand came up. And weighted on her wrist. \"What's wrong?\" He sighed. Almost as if it were a crime to say it. \"It tickles. A lot.\" A nervous. Anxious. Unabated. Laugh came out. Unwanted. Unstopped. And she tried to cover it. Pulling her hands. And unfortunately. The rest of the thread. He came forward with it. The shirt dropping to the floor. His head dropping into her neck as he laughed. A whispery laugh. That was silenced when his lips. Touched the skin of her neck. Soft. And he kissed her deeply. Her eyes closing. As she felt his breath. His teeth. His tongue. She pulled away with another laugh. Breathy too. Through her nose. Tucking the smile into her lips. Trying to hide the joy. His hand went to his chest. Feeling the spot. Where the stitches had been. \"It tingles...\" he said. Smiling slightly too. But not trying to hide it. Like she did. She got up. Pulling the wadded shirt with her. And nodded. Embarrassed. For liking what he did. So soon. \"It probably will for a few moments. I don't think they're suppose to come out like that.\" She locked her lips. To keep in the giggle. And he grinned up at her. Her rosy cheeks. Powdered by a blue bruise. She batted his head with the shirt. To beat down his smile. Playfully. \"Get dressed. I'm taking you downstairs to get something to eat.\" Before turning away. The smile breaking through. Teeth touching the air. She escaped into the bathroom. Shutting the door behind her. And leaning back against it. Her hand going up. Touching where he'd kissed her. Feeling it hot. And slightly moist. 'Get a hold of yourself!' she yelled in her head. Throwing the scissors into the drawer. And the stitching into the trash. Next to the toilet. As she came back out. He was just pulling his head through the top. Rolling it down his belly. It was tight. But loose enough to be comfortable. God he looked good. That blue shirt brought out his eyes. Made them glow. At least one of them. \"C'mon.\" She turned towards the door. Intent on being in front. In case more smiles came. To play. Then she heard a whimper from behind. And turned just as he caught himself from falling. His hand on the bedpost. She sigh-laughed. Exhaling through her nose. \"You're all helpless, aren't you?\" She came back. And let him put his arm around her shoulder. Helping to support him. \"I guess so.\" He smiled. And as they walked together. She couldn't get over his smell.[Chapter 21] CHAPTER TWENTY ONE – THE FOOD \"We didn't...\" she began. But didn't finish. Couldn't. He looked up from his tomato soup. Eyebrow cocked. She stirred her soup. With her spoon. In a mug. His in a bowl. \"Y'know...right?\" He grinned. At a slant. \"What?\" She used her hands. Adding motions. To try and help. Get the point across. \"Y'know...um...we didn't do 'it' right?\" \"Have sex?\" He was blunt. And loud. Lara looked around. For little fingers. Little eyes. Little ears. Before crouching down. Licking her lip. Questioning. \"No.\" He said. Turning back to his soup. Unwanted. \"I don't think we did.\" Trailing his spoon. Through the skin. \"Good.\" She leaned back. Then realized. And second-guessed. \"I mean –uh- not good like in 'good that we didn't.\" she was frantic. \"But good as in...'good that...we didn't...'\" she was at a loss. He was just lost. Smiling awkwardly. \"Nevermind.\" She threw her hands up. Turned to the hologram. And turned it off. Jimmy Neutron blinking. Before dying away to black. She turned back. \"So...\" He looked up again. She just smiled. Nervous. Frazzled. Weird. \"Where did you grow up?\" He shrugged. Pushing the soup away. \"I don't know.\" She blinked. \"What's your earliest memory?\" He thought for a moment. \"Seeing Agatha...can we not talk about my past?\" He asked. And she leaned back. Before nodding. Wanting to know more. Suddenly. More than ever. \"Sure...wha-whatever you want.\" He was sort of shamed. Now. And looked down at the counter. Dark. And blue. It seemed to bade his eyes. \"It's just that, every question you ask, I won't know the answer to...\" \"Okay...\" she comforted. Conversation died quickly. After that. Both breathing. Separately. His stomach growled. And his hand went down. A grimace on his face. \"Are you sure you're not hungry?\" The grimace faded for a moment. As he talked. \"I don't know, what does 'hungry' feel like?\" She tried to explain. \"It feels like you're empty. Like your stomach's about the size of a walnut. And it hurts. Does it hurt?\" He nodded. She pushed the soup back in front of him. \"Then you have to eat.\" He picked up the spoon. And sipped a bit. Before putting it back down. \"It hurts to eat.\" \"It's cause you're starving.\" She concluded. \"You're stomach's just not use to food.\" \"Here.\" She stood. Went to the cupboard. And pulled out some instant-meals. \"Go get your coat.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"We're going to go for a walk. The sunshine and exercise will get rid of your hunger pains.\" He wanted to object. But he didn't. He just got up. And followed her directions. \"What about Agatha?\" He asked. Slipping his arms into his coat. \"I'll leave her a note. She'll be alright.\" Lara came out of the kitchen. Carrying the instant-meals in a small knapsack. She reached into the closet. Past Catcher. To grab her coat. But stopped. And sniffed. Her face twisted. As she sniffed again. He looked at her. Sniffed. And his face twisted too. \"What is that?\" She asked. He shrugged. And sniffed. She came closer to him. Sniffing. Until finding the spot. She reached into his coat pocket. And drew out some wadded napkins. Hard. Crumbling. And rank. \"Geeze, what are these from?\" She held them away from her. They stunk that bad. He remembered. But shrugged. Like he didn't. They were from the dinner. At the restaurant. The war of the milk bubbles. She smiled. Because she knew it too. She'd seen them. Mopping. And stuffing. \"Go ahead and get another coat. That one stinks.\" She said. As she went to the kitchen. To throw the napkins away. He unshouldered his coat. And picked another one. A green sweatshirt. With a hood. From somewhere in the back. And put it on. She came back. About to open the door. When she looked at him. The green sweatshirt. Brought out the green. In his other eye. And she couldn't help. But smile. Then she pulled herself out of it. Shaking her head. \"Well then...\" she covered. She allowed him to go first. And shut the door quietly behind her. He'd stopped at the top of the steps. Waiting for her. \"Let's go...\" She said. \"...milk boy.\"[Chapter 22] CHAPTER TWENTY TWO – THE SNOWCONE They walked side by side. Hands shoved in pockets. Eyes trained on their feet. Lara in red shoes. Catcher in black boots. He kept sneaking glances at her. And she'd glance back at him. But they'd never see each other. Goldfish Park was warm and dry. Despite it being cold and dreary outside its paths. The holosphere kept out the wind. And the bad weather. Only creating a warm. Summery day. In the pith of November. They walked silently down the path. A little white girl in a red dress ran by them. A red mother in a white dress followed. Down by the ponds. Old men threw bread to the goldfish. While little boys threw rocks at the goldfish. Invisible, digital birds sang melodies from the treetops. Not in the park. Having migrated. The constant warmth having messed with their instincts otherwise. \"Let's go down here.\" Lara mentioned. Straying from the worn. Gray path. Catcher followed. She led him down the slight hill. To a spot beside a cement pond. Goldfish swam about. Lacing through the silvery water. \"Is this alright?\" She asked. Spreading out her arms. Catcher nodded. Hands shoved into his barrel pocket. On the front of the sweatshirt. Lara smiled. And began spreading out the blanket. One she'd gotten from a rack. When they'd first walked into the park. She laid it out. Then took off her shoes. And sat down upon it. Beckoning Catcher to do the same. In hesitance. He did. And sat. Looking at her. Still in his coat. She unshouldered hers. And set it beside her. Taking out the food. From the knapsack. She handed one to Catcher. He watched her as she pulled the cover back. Watching her shoulders fall. And her face twist. \"Shit.\" \"What's wrong?\" he asked. \"My food's passed its expiration…\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means it's spoiled. I can't eat it.\" She looked over at him. Reaching for his. \"How's yours?\" She opened it for him. It looked the same. \"Oh well,\" she said. Unfazed. \"We'll have to get something from the cart.\" She got up. And when she saw that he wasn't following. Put out her hands. He took them. And she pulled him up. Beginning to walk away. \"What about our stuff?\" he asked. Looking at their shoes. And her coat. \"They're alright.\" She said. \"We'll be back in a second.\" He caught up with her. Walking side by side again. \"So what do you feel like?\" \"Feel like?\" \"Eating!\" she emphasized. \"You need sustenance young fool!\" She smiled as they walked back towards the main path. Barefoot. Into the girth of cart food. They had everything at their disposal. They went by large carts. Wafting large smells. With large men pushing them. Yelling with large voices. \"What do you feel like?\" Catcher asked. Coming close when a cart got too near. Touching Lara's arm. Like a scared child. She noticed. But said nothing. \"I feel like…\" she rubbed her stomach. Asking it like a crystal ball. What did it want? \"…a big, huge hotdog. And a snowcone…\" she licked her lips. Letting her eyes close. As she took in the smells. \"A hotdog?\" Catcher asked. Looking at the people. So many people. \"Do you want one?\" She asked. But he didn't say anything. They were already at the cart. Lara ordered the hotdog. With relish. And ketchup. And mustard. Then she turned to Catcher. \"I'll have what you have.\" He surrendered. Watching. Waiting. And taking it when it was handed. Lara paid and they kept walking. \"You want a snowcone too?\" She asked. Taking a bite out of her hotdog already. Loving it. \"Sure.\" Catcher said. The talking from the people around them had grown more noisy. The cart men's yelling making sound claustrophobic. It was like a tiny city. Its main street being the noisiest. They went to the snowcone cart. Lara ordering a lemon snowcone for Catcher. And a blueberry one for herself. The ice dyed. Dark. And blue. \"Here you go.\" She handed the lemon off to Catcher. As they made their way back to their spot. Their stuff still there. Untouched. It was more quiet when they finally sat. Lara propped against the fountain side. Catcher sitting across from her. He was looking at his hotdog. \"They're very good, you know.\" She said. \"You don't have to be afraid of them.\" \"What is it made of?\" He poked at the relish. Smearing his fingertip yellow. From the mustard. \"Real meat. Back in the 90's, you didn't know what they were made out of. But they're safe now.\" She took another big bite. Wiping the ketchup from the corners of her mouth. With a smile. Catcher took a small bite. Tested it. Then chewed it up. Cringing slightly when he swallowed. \"Does it still hurt?\" \"A little.\" He set his hotdog down. Beside his leg. And watched the people. Walking by. She watched him. Eating while she did. Then looked away quickly when he turned back. She brushed at a hair that had fallen. Tucking it behind her ear. She picked up her snowcone. And took a big bite. Liking the crunch. The blueberry flavoring. Tasted good. Swam around her teeth. And dyed her tongue. Catcher was watching her. So she stuck her tongue out at him. Getting him to smile. \"Your tongue's blue.\" He said. Simple. Sweet. \"Ith ip?\" She asked. Keeping her tongue out. Trying to look at it. This made him laugh. A little laugh. She smiled. Then just looked at him. \"What?\" he asked. After a while. Taking little bites of his own. Snowcone. \"You may not know the answer to this.\" She comforted. \"But do you know what's wrong with your heart?\" He looked at her. Then down to his chest. Flat palming. Where his heart would be. \"No.\" He said. \"It just hurts.\" \"All the time?\" She asked. Brushing back the unruly hair. Again. Leaning forward. Biting her lip. \"Not when I'm with Agatha.\" He said. Looking up. Flicking back at how close she was. Then repositioning himself. So that their faces were close again. He liked feeling her breath. On his mouth. Warm. And swirling. Whenever she spoke. \"Or with you.\" She reached out. Tentatively. And touched where his heart was. Where his hand was. Gently. Smiling slightly at him. They looked at each other for a moment. Before Lara cleared her throat. And sat back. Drawing back her arm. Catcher caught it. In mid air. And wrapped it up with his hand. \"It doesn't hurt when you touch me...\" he said. Softly. She blinked. Before she leaned forward again. And kissed him. On the lips. Tasting him. For the first time. Then she sat back. Realizing what she'd just done. And liking it. He never let go of her hand. As his eyes came open. And he looked at her. Silently. \"You taste like lemons.\" She smiled. Whispering. The breeze washed through his hair. Making it shiver. The blanket made designs in his eyes. Red. And White. Squares. She broke away from his stare. Breaking her heart. And reached for her snowcone. Taking a bite. \"Heads up!\" Came a call. Lara immediately ducked. But Catcher... WHACK! A Frisbee hit him square in the face. It popped his head back. Lara's hands went to her mouth. Covering a smile. Untimely yes. But Catcher's shocked face. It was too much. \"I'm so sorry!\" A woman came by. Panicked. \"Are you alright sir?\" A dog followed her. Panting. Drooling. Climbed into his lap. And began licking Catcher's face. He pushed the dog away. Clutching his nose. \"Are you alright Catcher?\" Lara couldn't help the smile. But her words were sincere. Catcher rubbed at his nose. \"It hurts.\" He said. \"I'm so, SO sorry.\" The Frisbee woman said. Taking her dog by the collar. Keeping it off Catcher. Who it was trying to get back on. Lara put up a hand. \"He's alright.\" She said. Making sure he was. Catcher picked up the Frisbee. Which had fallen off to the side of his lap. And gave it to the woman. \"Again. I'm sorry.\" She said. \"Goodbye.\" As the woman left. Lara couldn't help but let out a laugh. It bent her into Catcher's lap. \"What are you laughing at?\" He asked. Holding his aching nose. \"I don't know.\" Lara finished laughing. And sat back up. \"Is it broken?\" She moved his hands. And gently pushed on his nose. He flinched and she frowned. While it still tried to twist into a smile. \"You poor thing. You should be alright.\" She sat back. Letting him have his nose again. As she reached over. And grabbed the last of her hotdog. Eating it down. She watched him for a while. Noticing his eyes watering. And wiped at them with her thumb. Wiping the tears on her pants. \"Are you sure you're alright?\" She asked. Frown smiling. Rubbing his shoulder. He squeezed his eyes shut. And lifted up his head. Trying to make the pain go away. \"We should probably be heading home.\" Lara said. Beginning to gather up the trash. She stood up. Bringing the trash with her. Then turned back to Catcher. \"Are you going to finish your hotdog?\" He shook his head no. And she took it up in her armload. \"You have to at least eat your snowcone.\" She stated. Looking down on him. He reached for his snowcone. And held it at his chest. Still holding his nose. A surprised look came over her face. And he looked down. Seeing a spot in his snowcone. Yellow. Change colors. Orange. He looked up at Lara. Perplexed. Slightly scared. \"It's alright.\" She said. Smiling. At the scared little child he was. \"It's just a nose bleed. That Frisbee really got you.\" He touched his nose. Feeling the wetness. And brought it down. Tasting it. Then he licked his lip. Caught in the tangy. Coppery taste of it. \"Here.\" She pushed his hovering hands down. And pushed a wad of napkins to his nose. He let her hold them there. As she stuck out her other hand. Juggling the trash. And helped him to his feet. \"Can you get my coat and the blanket?\" She asked. Breaking hands. He grabbed them up. And they went to walking. Back down the path. Back towards the house. They stopped at a trashcan nearby. And threw what they didn't want away. A chance of a glimpse in. Brought sight to a picture. Hidden beneath a wrapper. But enough to be recognized. Lara's eyes widened. As she reached in. And snatched up the paper. She crumpled it into her hand. And shoved it into her pocket. Then she took her place next to Catcher. As they walked. Acting as if nothing had happened.[Chapter 23] CHAPTER TWENTY THREE – THE DOORBELL She took a sharp breath. And reared up. From the smashed pillow. Where she'd fallen asleep. Crying. Her cheeks felt hard. Like they were going to crack. Her dried tears leaving salty trails. She uncurled herself. From the swath of blankets. And set her feet down on the ground. She stood for a moment. Getting her bearings. Looking at the clock. It flickered. As she passed her hand through it. Then she went towards the door. Opened it a sliver. Stood quiet. There was nothing to be heard. \"Mommy?\" she chanced. Breathy. And small. Nothing. \"Mommy?\" Louder now. Still nothing. Agatha yawned. And rubbed her eyes. Coming down the stairs. \"Mommy?\" Again. Into the living room. Nothing. She went into the kitchen. There was a note upon fridge. Telling her where they'd gone. Arranged under it. Were alphabet magnets. Saying. I LOVE YOU. I M SORRY. She should have been mad. But she wasn't. She smiled. And opened the freezer. Taking out her half eaten milkshake. Closing the door. And going to get a spoon. She crawled up onto the counter. Turned on the holovision. And watched The Smurfs. Eating her half frozen milkshake. She got through about four episodes. When the doorbell rang. She didn't move. She wasn't suppose to answer the door. There was a knock now. \"Lara?\" A call from outside. Agatha turned away. And looked at the door. Another knock. \"Lara? Are you there?\" The voice sounded familiar. So she crawled off the counter. Leaving her milkshake there. And the HV on. She came to the door. Too small to see out the peephole. \"Don't open the door when I'm not here.\" Her mother had said. But something told her she had to. This time. \"Lara?\" The call was sad. \"She's busy.\" Agatha said simply. \"Agatha?\" She blinked. The voice knew her name. That interested her in the identity of the person. Finally. She opened the door. And froze. There. On the front porch was a man. Standing slump shouldered. In a long. Black. Trench coat. The collar drawn up. His face chalky. His eyes dark. And red. With bags beneath them. Dark. And blue. Showing that he'd been crying. And drugging. He stood silent. Staring. Agatha blinked at this man. Twisting the doorknob. With her hand. \"Hi daddy.\"[Chapter 24] CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR – THE HAIR Squeezing the bridge of his nose. Right between his eyes. Made his nose. And his eyes. And the front part of his head. From hurting. The pain in the back. However. Nothing could be done. With one arm pinching his face. Lara had hers hooked around his other. He closed his eyes. To see if it would help. And almost ran into a pole. \"Whoa. You okay?\" Lara veered him over to the curb. Watching him reopen his eyes. And try to blink away the pain. \"It hurts.\" He said. His mouth coming open weirdly. Trying to stretch the pain out. Thinner. Less piercing. \"Let me see.\" She pushed down his hand. And poked lightly at his nose. He cringed away. \"Ow.\" \"It's bruising. There's blood in your eye.\" She pulled down his bottom eyelid. To get a better look at it. The blood was in the blue one. Dark. And blue. She kissed his chin. Then turned away. Taking his hand. \"Come on. We're going to get you some pain relievers.\" She felt a burst of energy go through her. And Catcher was at its mercy. They ducked into the nearest drug store. The bell rang. But didn't scan their eyes. It was an old store. The cashier. A large man. Named Amja. He had magic hair. And wore a black tee shirt. And orange pants. With big white words across it. WARNING: KEEP OUT OF CHILDREN. The law of the city taking humor almost too far. In 2022 they passed a law. Almost with a fire lit behind it. That pedophiles were to be castrated. Amja was one. And got the chop. A cross was around his neck. He thought himself to be saved. From himself. Lara pulled Catcher to a big black box. Behind it. In the wall. A conveyor belt ran from it. To a stall behind the counter. To Amja. Lara waved her hand. And the screen popped on. Catcher took a step back. In surprise. And Lara smiled. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE? It gave categories: Food. Clothes. Utilities. Toiletries. Entertainment. Medicine. Games. She touched. MEDICINE. It gave subcategories: Allergy. Pain. Prescription. Vitamins. She touched. PAIN. A slew of painkillers came up. The pharmacies had run rampant. Lara scrolled. And touched one. The black box chirped. And the painkiller appeared behind the counter. Coming into Amja's waiting hand. She went to turn away. But stopped in mid shift. Of her weight. She looked over to Catcher. Who stared back at her. And she licked her teeth. \"I want to show you something.\" She started over. ENTERTAINMENT. Its subcategories: Movies. Holovision Shows. Magazines. Newspapers. Radio. Music. She touched. MAGAZINES. She scrolled. And chose. Scrolled some more. And chose again. Catcher raised an eyebrow. She just smiled. And started over. For the third time. \"I'm feeling spontaneous.\" She mused. Touched. TOILETRIES. Its subcategories: Hair Care. Facial Care. Skin Care. Nail Care. Make-up. Accessories. She touched. HAIR CARE. Scrolled. And looked at the slew. \"Which one do you think?\" She asked. And Catcher seemed questioning. As always. \"For what?\" He asked. \"For something different. For me.\" He thought for a moment. Looked over the options. And chose. \"That one.\" \"Good. I was thinking that too.\" She pressed. And headed towards Amja. Who had the things waiting. She paid. Then pointed over her shoulder. \"Is your bathroom back there?\" Amja nodded. And bagged her things. Lara went back through the aisles. Catcher following. She went into the woman's bathroom. And he stopped outside. \"Don't be shy. No one's here.\" She pulled him in by the wrist. And shut the door behind him. Locking the deadbolt. She dumped the items down on the counter. And threw the bag on the floor. Catcher sat down on the floor. Opposite the sink. And Lara. She tore open the box of painkillers. Pulled out the bottle. Took off the wrapper. Unscrewed the cap. And shook out a long. Blue colored. Pill. Dark. And blue. \"These are like an instantaneous, mild euphoria.\" She said. Looking at him. Through the mirror. Then turned and tossed it to him. He caught it. And looked at it. Studying it. She bent down. Waved her hand. And the water came on. She cupped her hands. Filled them. And walked quickly. And carefully. Towards Catcher. Her hands dribbling a bit. \"Put it on your tongue. Don't chew it.\" She instructed. And he did. And she put her hands up to his chin. \"Drink.\" She said. And his dipped his lips into her palms. Swallowing the water. And the pill. Whole. With a little difficulty. His lips tickled her. As he drank her hands dry. Then she watched him soften. And begin to kiss her palms. His eyes closed. He kissed. At each section on her fingers. And pressed his face into the smooth. Of each palm. She liked that part. She moved her hands up. And her head down. To catch his lips. Lifting them. To her own. She kissed him deeply. Pressing herself against him. And his knees parted. To let her closer. She hooked her legs beneath her. Twisted them in his. Wrapped her arms around his back. And pulled him away from the wall. He came willingly. And his hand cradled the back of her head. His thumb. Strumming the dip in her neck. The base of her brain. As her hand slithered down. Swam through his clothes. The sweatshirt. The tee shirt. To touch skin. And went downward. She felt his fly. Grabbed the extended metal. And pulled. The zipper came down smoothly. The pants were old. And worn. And soft. She ventured inside. The zipper teeth abrading. Slightly. It was warm in his pants. And she felt his body stiffen. His lips stop kissing. Sucking in his breath. \"Do you want me to?\" She asked. Whispery. Not moving her hand. His eyelids flickered. His eyebrows stitching. Emotions passing. Over his face so quick. She couldn't catch them all. She forced him into a kiss. To keep him. From confusing himself. And he fell into it. \"Yes…\" he breathed. Then stiffened again. When she advanced softly. \"…and no.\" \"No, why?\" she asked. Not bitter. But curious. \"I told you I wouldn't hurt you. You're safe with me.\" \"…I…\" he said. And she kissed him. Just to pull a taste from him. With a barrage. And they found themselves spread out. Across the floor. Lara braced above him. Catcher on his back. She pulled away. To look at his face. Wrought with overall grief. \"We don't have to. Until you're ready.\" She said calmly. Smiling. Stroking the side of his face. \"I'm ready. I think. I just…\" his voice faded. And he took up her stroking hand. To kiss the soft pads. At the tips of her fingers. \"Just what?\" She wanted him to quit skirting. The issue. \"I don't know how.\" He practically breathed. Barely even words. It was so quiet. Lara almost laughed. But bent down. And muffled it with a kiss. A long. Loving. Kiss. Then she sat up on her knees. Leaned over to the side. And stretched over him. To reach the magazine. On the counter. \"Come here.\" She said. Leaning back. And moving to sit. With her back against the wall. She patted the spot next to her. And Catcher wriggled there. She handed the magazine over. And watched Catcher open it. Sounds came out. And Catcher shut it quickly with wide eyes. Scared eyes. His breath hissing. Lara couldn't help but laugh this time. And threw her hands up to muffle it. Catcher turned to her. His jaw open a bit. His eyebrows curled. His face slightly red. \"What was that?\" He asked. An almost disgusted look. Coming over his face. \"Aw, babe.\" She said. Sympathetically. She pulled him to sit in front of her. His pants sliding easily. On the slick floor. Her legs propped around his sides. His back against her chest. She took the soft porn magazine. And opened it up again. The sounds came out. And the recorded holographs floated off the page. She felt Catcher's body stiffen again. In a different way. And for a different reason this time. And she kissed his hair. On the back of his head. Comforting him. She held the page open for a little while. Letting Catcher see it. Hearing his breath catch in him. The uncomfortableness. When the people on the page had finished. With Lara smiling at Catcher's tweaking. Curling. Body. At the noises. She shut the magazine. And laid it down. Pulling Catcher's stiff body. Back into hers. Cradling it. Rubbing at his head. He touched her wrapping arm. His hands feeling clammy. \"That's sex Catcher.\" She said. And stroked his hair. It took a while. But an answer came. \"I don't think I can do that.\" Lara smiled. And buried her face in his hair. \"You can. You just don't know it. It will come naturally. Like breathing.\" He relaxed back into her a bit. His hands not so clammy. \"That didn't look natural.\" He said softly. And Lara blew a breath of laughter. Out her nose. Onto his head. It warmed his scalp for a moment. \"It's alright. You'll know how to do it when you're ready.\" She said aloud. While in her mind. She thought. 'How can he not know so many things?' \"How's your headache?\" She asked. \"Better. I think.\" He said. \"What about your belly ache?\" She touched his belly. \"It still hurts a little. But less than before.\" His eyes falling on the closed magazine that lay at their side. Remembering what he saw. Even though he said nothing. She could feel the doubt in him. The worry. And the wonder. Surrounding him. At himself. At her. At them. And she decided to ease his mind for a bit. \"Here.\" She said. Pushing him up. Off of her. Enough to slip out. And away. \"There's something you can help me with.\" She went to the counter. And pulled out the large box. And turned to him. Patting the counter. \"Come up here.\" Sighing. He rose. Walked. And jumped up onto the counter. Leaving the magazine on the floor. She opened the box. Dumped out the things. And pressed the top corner of the box. A holograph came up. Showing the instructions. When it finished. It disappeared back against the box. \"Sounds easy enough.\" Lara smirked. And unscrewed the cap. To the bleaching agent. She took out a cap. That had come in the box. And put it on. Shoving all her hair into it. It was like a soft helmet. See-through. That didn't cover her ears. It looked slightly silly. With a nozzle thing. Sticking out from the top. And it made Catcher smile. \"Here,\" she tipped her head. \"Put this,\" pointing to the end of the bleaching tube. \"In here,\" pointing to the nozzle thing. He did. And locked it in. Like the holograph had showed. Then pressed the button on the top of the bleach. The effect was almost immediate. Her hair turned. In the blink of an eye. From black brown. To a yellowish white. And a light came on. On the bleaching bottle. Signaling that it was done. \"Okay,\" Lara said. Excitement in her voice. \"Now for the color.\" She handed him the coloring tube. And he locked it into the nozzle. Throwing away the empty bleach one. He went to touch the button. But she stopped him. \"Wait.\" She smiled. \"I want it to be a surprise.\" He thought for a moment. Too long. And was shooed off the counter by her. Chasing him into the stall. She closed it on his face. With a kiss goodbye. And he only smiled goofily at her. Amused. Going back to the counter. Looking in the mirror. She pressed the button. The color came out. And she waited. This one took longer. Not much. But longer than the bleach. When it lighted done. She took out the tube. Threw it away. Then took off the cap. Crumpled it up. And threw that away too. Then she messed with her hair. Deciding if she liked the color. Surprised at how it changed her face. Liking it. Loving it slowly. In fact. When she felt satisfied. She went triumphantly to the stall. And opened it up. Standing akimbo. \"What do you think?\" Running her fingers through it. Cocking an eyebrow. Playfully. It was bright red. The box had said the color was. \"Vendetta Red\". She could see the color reflecting in his eyes. The green one turned brown. The blue one turned purple. And his lips turned up into a smile. \"I like it.\"[Chapter 25] CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE – THE HOMECOMING Lara let go of Catcher's arm. And went to her pocket for the key. But it was not in there. \"That's weird.\" She said. Catcher cocked an eyebrow. And turned the knob. The door came open. \"Is that weird too?\" He asked. Lara stepped past him. Looking in. \"He's still here, I see.\" The voice came from the kitchen. And it made Lara's hair stand up on the back of her neck. \"John?\" \"Yes. It's me.\" The voice was cold. Distant. Sad. \"Go check on Agatha.\" Lara whispered to Catcher. Pushing him towards the stairs. She walked in. And Catcher followed. Seeing John at the counter. Drinking out of the milk carton. The cow on it mooed. Milk dribbled down his chin. His lip was numb. His face was dead looking. She didn't like it. \"He's wearing my sweatshirt…\" there was hate in his words. She turned. And looked at the sweatshirt. But didn't say anything. Her hand went down to her finger. Touching the splint. \"I didn't come here to yell at you.\" John said. Slowly. \"Then what did you come here for?\" She asked. Not looking up from the ground. \"I came to apologize…\" he gripped the carton. But didn't raise it. To his lips. Lara stopped breathing. And her eyes slowly closed. \"I'm not going to take any more of your apologies John.\" He didn't move. \"I don't have enough energy left to take any more apologies.\" Slowly. He closed the top of the carton. And let go. Then turned. His throat was bruised. There were tears in his eyes. His face looked heavy. She felt her stomach knot. As he fell to his knees. Her arms reach out. To touch him. \"I've missed you Lara.\" John shed a tear. As he reached beneath her arms. Outstretched. And wrapped his own about her waist. Burying his head. Against her belly. Her hand went to his head. Feeling his hair. His cheek against her stomach. After a moment. He raised his head. And met her eyes. Coming back up to stand. He looked at her for a long while. Before he leaned in. And kissed her. At first. She kissed him back. Then she noticed his smell. As it touched her nose. Wasn't the same as she remembered it. He didn't smell like John. It smelled rotten. And cold. And her lips turned stiff. After sucking what he wanted off her. He pulled away. Question in his eyes. Someone else's eyes. She hated what he'd become. Her voice came out cold. Stern. \"I don't want to see you around here John. You have a sickness. And I don't want you around my daughter with it.\" \"You're right.\" John relented easily. \"I do have a sickness. But you don't have to take my daughter away from me...\" his words were pleading. \"I want you to go away.\" Her eyes were sad. But her words were firm. He was silent for a moment. Sadness reflecting in his sunken eyes. Bleary eyes. Missing eyes. \"I have no where to go.\" He said. Quietly. Pathetically. It was silent again. For a long. Long. Time. \"You can have the couch.\" She broke. Bitterness suddenly sprouted. As John's attention. Turned to Catcher. Who'd been standing there. The whole time. A shadow. \"Where does dead boy sleep?\" \"My room.\" She whispered. His face became stricken. Distressed. His mouth fell open. \"With you?\" He didn't believe. \"In the same bed?\" Couldn't. \"Next to you?\" Believe. Each question he asked. Pushed him farther away. Then he ever wanted to be. And brought Catcher. Ever closer. She didn't mean to say it. \"Sometimes Agatha's room.\" Almost. Turning her head away. Looking at Catcher's feet. His black boots. She knew that'd hit a nerve. John's jaw hit the floor. His shoulders sank. His cheeks turned red. His forehead gray. His neck blue. His eyes black. \"You trust him with Agatha?\" His hand came up. Stiff finger pointing. As if to fire a bullet. At Catcher's chest. Catcher's hand tightened. On her shoulder. \"More than you.\" She breathed. \"Yes.\" Looking up. At him. His jaw shook. His eyes watered. And his knees bent. But he did not fall. When his shaking body stopped. He looked up at her. His arms out. Palms up. Cupped. In repose. He looked pathetic. \"More then me?...More than me...More than me?\" His voice grew. Caught in his throat. Stuck in the bruise. Coarse to the ears. Lara flinched. Catcher's hand tightened. While the other snaked around her waist. Pulling her in. Away from John. She put her own hand on it. Welcoming it. And a fire lit in John's eyes. Before fogging over. \"I see then.\" His mouth quivered. As he rose to his feet. Lara's eyes closed. And she sighed. As she watched John head for the couch. Then she turned. And whispered to Catcher. \"Go check on Agatha.\" He paused. An eye wary on John. Before he let his arms slide from her. And he moved towards the stairs. Went up. And disappeared. Lara followed John into the living room. Watched him lay down on the couch. And curl up. Fetally. Tears came in her eyes. But she held them back. Going to the closet. Pulling out a blanket. Dark. And blue. And draping it over him. His own eyes were filled with tears. And she had to walk back across the room. Keeping her distance from him. He watched her. With cold. Dark. Gray. Foggy. Eyes. Half swollen. Half wet. Not his. That's what she heard in her head. Every time she looked at him. His eyes. Not his. Someone else's. \"Why do you trust him more than me?\" His voice was meek. But brought her out of her thought. She shifted. And pulled her arms about her. Suddenly feeling cold. \"Because he doesn't lose my children…\" it was a whisper. But it struck her like a shriek. And she stumbled back. Overcome with the guilt of having said that. And she had to pant to recover. Tears fell fluidly down her cheeks. John did not move. His stare became blank. Distant. Gone. \"I...I...have to...\" she stuttered. And ran from the room. Not finishing her retreat. Fleeing to the kitchen. Smacking her shoulder into the wall. Ricocheting. Spinning. And backing into the little corner. Between the cupboards. And the fridge. Where she sank to the floor. Crying. She stayed there for a long time. Her eyes becoming sore. The edges of her mouth too. Her head aching. Her hands were coated in tears. And snot. And sweat. As she finished. Rose on shaky legs. And wobbled to the counter. Where she fell again. She reached for a towel. And cleaned off her face. Her hands. Before throwing it down. Sucking in her breath. Trying to regain herself. When she felt ready. She rose. And went back out to the living room. Only to find John. Passed out. His mouth open. His breath hissing. And pressed. In his pinched throat. She went by him quietly. Stripping from her jacket. Throwing it to the floor. Up the stairs. She opened the door to Agatha's room. Silently. And found Catcher curled around the little girl. He raised his head to her. Staring. She smiled back. It was pitiable. Drenched in tears. Catcher raised up. His face curious. But Lara raised her hand. Telling him to stay. As she turned. And went down the hall.[Chapter 26] thank you to all the reviewers who haven't given up on me - although you probably ought to of by now - and i'd like to especially thank bookbindersdaughter whom is the most consistant person i've ever met. i wish i could give you a great big hug sweetie, you've always been so kind. more than i deserve. i swear that someday i'll update my American Outlaws story once i figure out what the hell i'm going to do with it (if anyone has any suggestions feel free to e-mail me! you'll get credit for it, i'll make sure of that!) and speaking of, in any of you would like to screw around with any of my unfinished stories, go right ahead - but remember to tell me! thanks. bye. CHAPTER TWENTY SIX – THE PAPERS She clicked. Two wedding bands came up on the screen. Entwined. Before they broke apart. And the little cartoon. Man and wife. Frowned. And broke apart with them. The flash opening. To a divorce site. She typed in a name. Clicked. And waited. Four seconds later. Divorce papers were cooling on the printer shelf. The ink drying. She turned away from it. And looked to another paper. The one she'd dug out of the trashcan. On their walk back. The sound chip in the newspaper. Had run out. In the trash. There was motion. But no sound. It flashed a picture of Danny Witwer. His face. Before doing a 360 around him. And then flashing his corpse. The face was mangled. Barely a face. It showed a shaky interview. With a large woman. With a hook. For an arm. She looked angry. And she shoved her hook into the camera lense. The screen fizzled. Then a message blared. Big white words. MISSING It didn't matter though. The search had stopped. Two weeks after. No one missed his corpse. Then the video restarted. Catcher looked too much like the corpse. But she'd always known that. Too much like Danny. Somehow she'd always known too. That Catcher was Danny. But a different Danny. One that didn't know. What he'd been. Who he'd been. She glanced back at the divorce papers. That empty line that begged her name. The line that begged John's. And she looked at the pen. Sitting by her splayed hand. Then to the newspaper video. She heard a heavy sigh. And she tipped her chair back. Seeing John lying there. Curled on the couch. Wrapped in a blanket. Breathing softly. He almost looked pleasant. Until he shifted. And the blanket came down. Revealing his neck. Blackened. And bruised. Dark. And blue. And she turned away. Sickened. Her eyes meeting that line. Begging. She picked up the pen. Pleading. Touched its tip to the paper. Praying. And signed. When finished. She looked at the messy curls. Slippery letters. Cold. But smiling. The pen slid from her fingers. She pressed her eyes. Into the heels of her hands. Before dropping her head. Fairly hard. Onto the table. She laid there for a long while. Thinking. Hard. She dozed. For a moment. Her upright arm. Falling against her ear. Brushing past her hair. Red. And waking her. She breathed in. And rose from the table top. Rubbing at her face. Rising. Gathering the divorce paper. She walked slowly out of the kitchen. Towards John. Watching him sleep. Watching his neck. Wishing. In vain. That it was someone else's. Like his eyes. Something he could give back. She draped the paper on him. And put the pen beside him. Before kneeling down in front of him. And looking. Doing nothing else. But breathing. Intentionally. Not with his. That's when she heard Agatha. Screaming.[Chapter 27] The door opened.nTo blood. Catcher wasncurled on the bed. Agatha was curled around him. In a pool of blood. Her head wasnburied in his chest. Her little arms. Once white. Now stained red.nLike Catcher's shirt. The sheets. The wall. \"Whatnhappened?\" Lara lunged for the bed. Prying at Agatha's hands. Tonget her away from the blood. Agatha's head came up. \"No mommy!\"nHer scream was hysterical. Horrified. Permanent. \"I can't letngo.\" It became a mantra. \"I can't let go. I can't let go. Incan't let go...\" Lara. Hindered.nMoved to Catcher. \"Catcher? Whatnis it? What happened? Why are you bleeding?\" Her hands went to hisnside. And as soon as she touched. He kicked. And curled. And cried.n\"Help me.\" He whispered. \"Indon't...what's wrong? Why are you bleeding? What happened?\" Shentried to find his eyes. In a mess of blankets. Clothes. Blood. Andnhair. The stain wasndown his chest. Pooling around him. Agatha. Soaking the sheets.nSplashed. And smeared against the wall. \"I'm callingnthe hospital.\" She turned. Shenturned. And screamed. \"John!\" Butndown the stairs. John didn't move. His eyes were on the paper. Hisnlips parted. His ears deaf. His head down. His hands shaking. Hisnthoughts raging. Catcher groanednhoarsely. A gurgling scream. Lara turned back at the sound. Agathanbegan to cry. Her arms tight around him. Her eyes cinched closed.n\"Mommy!\" She cried between Catcher's moans. \"Help him!\" \"I can't...\"nLara stammered. \"I don't...\" She had no clue what to do. She flippednaround again. And took one. Long. Step towards the door. Only to hearnCatcher. And Agatha. Cry out. And she flipped back. Catcher'snbloody hand was out. His other lost in the gore. That was his chest.nIt was reaching towards her. Agatha was hanging on. Scared. They werenall scared. \"What Catcher?nWhat?\" Lara went down on her knees. Taking Catcher's hand.n\"What?\" He just laynthere. Twisting. Writhing. Grimacing. Moaning. Spitting breaths. With a sudden.nSpewing. Cry. He rose to sit up. \"No!\" Laranlunged to push him back down. Agatha cried out. But Catcher heldnup against Lara's weight. And pushed her back. She fell to thenground. The carpet burning the backs of her thighs. He cried outnagain. As he pushed his legs over the side of the bed. Agatha comingnwith him. His head dropping slightly. A new surge of blood washingnthrough his fingers. His cries becamena function of movement. But with each one. His face grew more gray.nMore blood on his shirt. More terror in Agatha's face. As the bloodndribbled in her hair. Down her face. Onto her room. \"Catcher whatnare you doing!\" Lara screamed. Rising to her feet. On wobbly legs. With a greatngroan. Splitting into a scream. Towards the end. Catcher rose to hisnfeet. And almost fell back again. But Lara caught his shoulder. Andnhe fell into her. The combinedndeadweight of him. And Agatha. Nearly knocked her over again. But shenheld fast. Agatha slowlynslipped down his body. Her little arms tearing at his clothes. As shentried to find a hold. Catcher's manipulated body ground itselfnagainst Lara's. Blood spitting onto her. Smearing against her.nPooling beneath her. \"You'll killnyourself!\" She tried to warn him. But he didn't listen. He wentnout into the hall. To the end. and pushed himself down the stairs.nTaking it step. By blundering step. Catchernslipped a little. At the bottom. Feet heavy. Eyes rolling. Headntipping. Lara had tonadjust her hands. Pressing. Pulling. Moving him. Her stomach sinkingnas she saw. The couch wasnempty. The paper signed. The blanket fallen. The door open. Johnngone. Catcher pushednhimself. Heavy. To the doorway. Which was letting in lashing rain. But there.nStanding just at the foot of the porch. Calm and dry. Beneath a clearnumbrella. Was an old woman. With a wrinkled smile. \"Hello.\" Shensaid sweetly. \"What's this then?\" ","Summary":" --- CHAPTER ONE --- NEW YORK CITY --- 2O54 He lay there. Not moving. Not breathing. Not thinking. N"}]
